{"text":"Outstanding in every way! We have become regulars. The sushi is great and the staff is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"favourite restaurant in madison! I love the miso black code!"}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious food. The coconut shrimp was to die for. The specialty rolls are equally good."}
{"text":"This is excellent sushi. The fish is fresh and the selection superb. I usually order the small chef's choice sushi plate. I always enjoy the array of sushi and rolls I'm given, and it is a bargain at $15. Be sure to try the bonito... Wow. For sushi lovers and haters alike, the miso black cod is a star. Nice sake variety too."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in Madison! Always fresh and delicious! I what's test my luck and go with the Maki combo. I have yet to be disappointed. I also really enjoy the seaweed salad. Very filling and satisfying. I always want to order an entree, but have yet to do so. The sushi is just so good and so filling! One of these times I will.... I also love the location in Hilldale-- I usually do some shopping beforehand, then end our date night win a movie at Sundance. It's perfect! 
If you have a craving for sushi, make it Muramoto!!!"}
{"text":"The best staff in Madison, hands down. Alex, one of the managers has always given us exceptional service. Not to mention the best sushi in the area. The ingredients are fresh, flavorful and quality every time. Don't waste your time with anywhere else if you are interested in exceptional service and sushi."}
{"text":"I love the Muramoto downtown, but I live by Hilldale, so my friend and I tried it out last night.

We were seated quickly, and brought our edamame and wine within minutes. The waitress was efficient, but didn't smile once. Then, we waited over 45 minutes for our soup. My friend asked the waitress when it would be out, and she answered without looking at us: \"Should be right up.\" 10 minutes later, she wandered over and said \"Oh, you haven't even gotten your soup yet!\"

No, we haven't, and you obviously weren't listening earlier. How long does it take to ladle out two bowls of soup? We watched her ask the kitchen staff for the soup, and she was back with it  a minute later. Easy fix. 

She brought out our rolls before we were finished with the soup, then brought us the check before we were finished with the rolls. Her timing was way off.

The food was good, and about average price for sushi in Madison, but the service was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Hand's down best sushi in Madison. I love the miso black cod too. I love the $10 3 roll sushi lunch special -- it's more sushi than I can eat, so I usually share that and order an appetizer or two."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great wait staff, but the way they take/don't take reservation is a big issue. 45 minutes wait on busy nights so the need is there but they don't call back, or accept reservations for less than 6 people.  And then they only take 2 reservations per night for the entire restaurant. Curious to say the least."}
{"text":"We have been to numerous restaurants for sushi across the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S. and I can confidently say that Muramoto is one of the top 3!! The reason I am posting this is not only because we love Muramoto, but because a great place requires the service to go along with the food and tonight they impressed me. We ordered takeout and they forgot 3 items and by the time I arrived home I had received a call apologizing, before I even knew this, for forgetting these items and that they really wanted to make it right. Since I used a card they credited me the items along with an additional discount for the items we actually had. I was shocked! Since I had ordered more than enough sushi already I wasn't really upset I didn't have the 3 rolls, so I was fine with what they had offered. Could I have gone another avenue in negotiating what they could have done, certainly, however how many places will catch something like this, A, and if they do will immedietly offer something in return? Only the best!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison. 
Not the best ever, but considering Wisconsin is not exactly ocean-adjacent, it is really impressive.
The Muramoto Martini is one of my all time favorite cocktails:
\"death's door vodka or gin, wasabi infused shochu, served with wasabi and ginger stuffed olives\"
Its just plain awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.

My wife and I regularly visit Sushi Muramoto, and there is a reason we keep returning: the food, and service, is outstanding. The Kobe beef sashimi is incredible! The lettuce wrap chicken appetizer is ridiculously delicious. The food is authentic Japanese. What more could you ask for? 

Thank the gods for Sushi Muramoto...!"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times in the past 2 years, three times in past 2 months. 

Tonight Friday night, unfortunately for a special occasion, was disappointing. Crabcakes and fried calamari - very good. Beefsteak entrée - a bit tough and meat should have been trimmed better. Special sushi rolls were at least 30% smaller (and I think missing ingredient) than I had previously. Dessert custards with red beans and fresh fruit - very nice like before.

Service was efficient but impersonal and distracted. Perhaps I'll return for lunch sometime, to give them another chance... 

Too pricey for the inconsistency."}
{"text":"I love this place.   One of the few places that does Sushi right.  I've had a lot of bad Sushi in my days, unfortunately.  I haven't had a single bite from this place that wasn't delicious, and I've been here about 4 or 5 times.  I always really like the staff too.  I've had this one waiter twice.  He's got brown hair and a beard.  Real nice fellow, very attentive, and has a nice respectful presence.  I will definitely be back for more as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Love their lunch specials! Unlike many restaurants in town which only offer lunch specials on weekdays, Sushi Muramoto offers lunch specials all seven days of the week. Which means that if you sleep in on the weekends, you get to wake up to great Japanese-fusion food!! *yums*

Their blackened miso cod and their steak make for great items on the specials menu. I love their salad, which comes with light Japanese sweet-vinegar dressing and is topped with cornflakes. The cornflakes really add an extra crisp to the salad, so unusually perfect ~~ 

They serve nice sushi, but coming from Asia I have always thought that the sushi here are kind of over-priced, and to me they are luxurious items which I only order on the occasional side. With that said, though, this is one of the places where I would feel comfortable ordering sashimi because they serve high-quality food using fresh ingredients. 

One more thing, calamari. I have always associated calamari with Italian restaurants, where I'd had some of the best. So I never thought a Japanese-based restaurant could re-invent calamari and make it so good!! They are fried in light batter till crispy, and served with Japanese soba and ponzu mayonaise as dips. You will not regret trying this ~~

And how can I leave out the desserts?? Go for the classic Japanese ice-cream. Black seasame, so indulgently rich. And the red bean pudding is awesome too, not too sweet, makes a nice balance to the meal. 

If you go in groups they have kind of a private dining area at the back of the restaurant. Service is pretty good for the most part, though at times you have to get your waiter's attention if you need something, especially when they are busy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute must. My friends and I keep returning and it never lets us down! 

Today, we arrived at around 1:00 (so we ordered from the lunch menu) and although there was a 5-10 minute wait, it was worth it. 

My companions and I ordered the appetizer shrimp tempura ($9) to share. The shrimp was crispy, sauce was excellent and the asparagus was seasoned just right. I ordered the Miso Black Cod ($12) and it was divine. The fish was tender and seasoned extremely well. The sautéed vegetables were crisp and delicious. My friends ordered the Hanger Beef Steak ($12) which he throughly enjoyed and my other friend ordered the fried tofu which she also said was very tasty. 

I've only have been here during the lunch specials (11:00-3:00pm), but I always keep coming back. A fantastic Japanese restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in madison I've come across. If you are from one of the coasts and are sushi fans this dinner won't live up to high expectations but the food is good non the less. I like the decor and atmosphere, wait staff has always been nice to me. All in all a good little place for a date night."}
{"text":"It's one of the few decent Japanese restaurants in Madison. I used to hit this place a lot in college."}
{"text":"Gross. This place was not good. At all. And the service was especially slow. 

We ordered:
Calamari- nothing special. But, I liked that it wasn't so bread-y. You could actually taste the squid so one star for that. Ate less than half.

Avocado roll- nothing special. Rice to avocado ratio was nice so two stars for the avocado-y taste. Almost finished the dish. Left a few pieces. 

Asparagus roll- same as the avocado roll.

Sweet shrimp- I saw the cook (not sushi chef) use his water-rinsed hands to thaw the shrimp under the running water in the sink. Hubs took one bite. What should've been a sweet tender taste was just a weird fishy taste. And it was semi-cooked instead of raw. Zero stars.

Uni- didn't touch. We were expecting the golden yellow hue with a resemblance to a fatty tongue. Got slivers of neon orange blah mess.  Hubs was way too turned off by the color to eat it. Zero stars.

Unagi roll- hubs ate two pieces. Said the eel had a weird taste. Zero stars.

Miso cod entree- decent. However, I didn't like the fact that they made this fifteen minutes before actually serving it to us. We sat right by the cook station so I could see everything being made and being brought out. My cod dish sat there for so long that it was warm/cold by the time I got it. My rice (served in a separate bowl) had an eyelash in it. Two stars for the fish only. We were served two pieces. Ate the smallest piece and to-go'd the rest.

The waiter also brought out two dishes that we didn't order- which we also didn't touch. He got a little defensive when we told him we didn't order it. Manager took it off our bill. 

What REALLY turned me off personally was that our waiter was trying to get the customers to get the escolar sushi in place of the toro sushi (they were out of the toro that day). He said the taste was comparable to the toro. Uh. No. First off, escolar is the cheapest fish out there. Second, it is the most controversial fish out there as well. Google the side effects. It's not pretty. 

All in all, I would not go back."}
{"text":"I'm consistently frustrated by how difficult management makes it to eat here.  

When I called ahead to make reservations for our party of four, I was told that they do not accept reservations for parties of less than six people, but that we would be fine if we got there by 6 oclock.

We arrived at 530...and there was a 30 minute wait. 

I'll never go back- I prefer dining at establishments which respect my time."}
{"text":"Been dining with Muramoto for a number of years and generally been pleased with the sushi. However, today my wife and I waited at lunch 40 minutes for 3 rolls and a chicken teriyaki. This has happened several times in the past and seems to only happen when ordering one of the less expensive lunch specials. I finally asked our waiter to check on our order after 35 minutes. When the sushi finally arrived about 1/2 the rolls we falling apart. All 3 rolls were warm. The tuna roll was about the size of my little finger and tasted as though the fish was off. The cucumber roll was simply chopped cucumber in rice (no flavor or seasoning at all). My wife's lunch arrived about 5 minutes later and it was fine though probably should have been served a bit closer to the sushi.

This has happened several times in the recent past. I think this is strike 3. Don't see myself going back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has poor service for the most part.  The food is very inconsistent.  I have tried this restaurant too many times.  The last visit was the worst, with a big gross  black hair in the shrimp tempura.  Alas, another spot in Madison that is crossed off the list."}
{"text":"Had high expectations and really can only give a average review. Atmosphere was loud and you are close to each other. Sushi was ok! That's the best I can say I had better and worse."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever encountered in Madison. I have been a fan of Muramoto both at Hilldale and on King Street and am sorry to say I am not  planning to return . Our waitstaff regularly interrupted our conversation and put his face near my plate to stare at one of the rolls while trying to figure out what was in the \"chef's special.\" Combine that with a hostess who told us we had to move to the bar because \"the wait for tables was too long,\" she needed our table, and then grabbed our drinks and told us to \"move\" and I've pretty much decided I'm done with this place. We had been seated less than an hour and our food was slow to arrive. Can you ask guests to free up a table? Absolutely. Can you graciously help them relocate to another area? Sure. The kicker: there weren't any seats at the bar where we could have been seated even if we had wanted to stay. The inexperience and crassness of the staff showed. There are too many great restaurants in Madison to waste time being treated this poorly."}
{"text":"Visited on a recent Monday and the place was still fairly busy which is a good sign. Had the hot/sour soup which was excellent and a tuna sampler.  Unliike some here the service was fine and the overall experience very good.  I'll be back anytime I'm in Madison. Some of the hot items looked very good and I want to try them."}
{"text":"This is still one of the best sushi joints in town. I had the Dragon Special Roll tonight, and this sushi is to die for. It just melts right in your mouth. 

My only complaint: We were seated by the window, and considering it's winter, the draft was quite strong. For some reason, our chairs absorbed the cold which made the whole dining experience a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Their sushis are the best in Madison and trust me I've been to every sushi place there is in Madison. On top of their amazing sushis, their chicken lettuce wrap and crab cake are great as well. 
The only reason I'm giving them a 4 stars instead of a 5 is that it is a little expensive. I've been here for like 10 times (with my girlfriend) and I had to spend at least 75 bucks each times (I eat a lot). 
Anyways this is a great place to have a date at or just hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"$10 for three rolls? It doesn't get any better than that. Came at 2 pm on a Saturday and it was popping- the only open spots were at the sushi bar which worked out great cause that's where we preferred to sit anyways.

One of the lunch specials is a 3 roll chef's choice, you get one regular veggie roll, one regular  seafood roll, and one inside out roll.
Myself and the person I was with both did this special and then split it ourselves so we got to try six different rolls. The rolls we were given were: avocado, pickled daikon, tuna, something else, shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna. The normal rolls seemed kinda small initially but the three rolls was surprisingly very filling. They tasted good and I loved the ginger and wasabi they came with- the ginger isn't the dyed pink kind you typically see.

The best part about the meal was watching the chefs make the specialty rolls and form the nigri. The couple next to us was celebrating a birthday and the platter the sushi chef made for them was incredible - I definitely want to come back to try their specialty rolls and nigri.

Service however was a 2/3- it took over 15 min for a waitress to come by to take our order (including drink order) and this was only after we asked for someone to take our order. Then throughout our time there our water wasn't refilled, I had to ask a waitress refilling someone else's water to refill mine. 

If I had bought the three sushi rolls a la carte sushi this would probably be a three star review but for $10 I can't complain."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.   I do not recommend this unless you have a lot of time to wait. After our 30 minute wait for 2 rolls and order of chicken teriyaki in a half full restaurant I will say the Ecuador roll was quite good with a spicey kick. Chicken teriyaki was tasty. Felt bad for our waiter as it seemed his food was specifically not coming out. Problem was kitchen and sushi chefs. No excuse."}
{"text":"Shinji has no equal in Madison when it comes to sushi.  His choices are way, way deeper then other places and everything is great - the rolls, the nigiri, the cooked dishes.  Try the sweet and sour soup also. 

It is also the only place in town, to my knowledge, that offers \"real\" or fresh wasabi (made on the spot by grinding an actual wasabi root with a shark skin grater, not the instant play dough stuff). 

The decor is also great and the sake list is good. I will agree with one of the other reviewers that the service can be spotty. Most are very good, some are quite bad."}
{"text":"We joke that the best food in Madison is Japanese, and Muramoto is consistently our favorite go-to restaurant in Madison, especially for the lunch specials. We tend to stick to the special rolls, so can't comment on entrees. Ambiance is nice but not stuffy, and service has been consistently good. Waitstaff have always been friendly and accommodating, though we tend to go at non-peak times. A note to first-timers who rarely frequent Hilldale -- trust your GPS, the place is actually there! It's just that the exterior is so minimalistic that you will probably miss it unless you walk past it at least once."}
{"text":"Having just moved from the West Coast to Madison, I was hoping to find some decent sushi since on the West Coast the sushi is top notch.
I went last Friday with my wife to Sushi Muramoto, when we walked in the place was pretty busy so I took that as a good sign.
There was a 20-30 minute wait so we had a drink at the bar (hostess was very abrupt and since I was not a regular was very rude).
On the West Coast we had a Japanese sushi chef (actually 2) who were very traditional serving us fresh sashimi and sushi.
At the bar there was a handful of chefs who were busy laughing and talk amongst themselves and not engaging us for a full 15 minutes,I guess the party was behind the bar.
When we finally were asked if we would like to order we got a variety of sushi and sashimi.
I have had fresher fish from Whole Foods really and that's kinda sad.
Muramoto get off your high horse and realize that you need to more on your game.
I have had muchbetter and cheaper sushi in Los Angeles with no attitude, so why do I have to compromise in Madison shame on you, shame on me but never again."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. If you love sushi, or even are looking to try sushi, this is an excellent place to go."}
{"text":"Good service, nice \"sushi\" atmosphere.  Compares favorably to some of the sushi places we've been to in San Francisco, which is good considering we are a bit far from  the ocean.  My only negative was that the wine list was a bit short on options."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was slow. They were busy, could have used more staff. Saw that they had sent a few people home. Other than that great place to go for good sushi. Sitting at the sushi bar is always fun."}
{"text":"My usual motto for any meal/dining experience is to give things a second chance. That is the case with anything in my life. With that said, I am not sure if I would so for this place. My family and I went there to celebrate based upon some recommendations by a friend. It was all well and good, until we started the order process ... and it was quite a process. Once the order was placed we had an awful long wait, and with my parents being diabetic, was not a good mix. Our drinks were never refreshed unless we asked more that 3 times. By the time the food arrived at the table and not all at once mind you, some of the food was over cooked or cold. We decided to dare and take a chance and order dessert ... and much to our dismay, the dessert never arrived. After a little over a thirty minute wait, we asked for our check, paid up and left.
I understand that weekends can be a busy time for any establishment ... but it was a very disappointing evening of dining out for our family."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for sushi in Madison, has a really great atmosphere and the food is always great! Fast service too... Only unfortunate thing is that the tables are so close together because it's a small place."}
{"text":"Cute, chic little place with a front door that makes it look like a speakeasy, but disappointing sushi. The most important thing in sushi is freshness: if it's fresh, nothing else matters, if it's not fresh, nothing else matters. The seafood at Sushi Muramoto is not that fresh and you can tell just by looking at it. You're better off with the fusion cuisine dishes, but skip the curry bouillabaisse- nice try with daring spices, but not that flavorful. If you want a good bouillabaisse/cioppino in Madison, go to Bonfyre instead. Kobe beef and foie gras \"sashimi\" are great."}
{"text":"Great sushi, not so great staff. The host could not have less personality...and I realize you don't pay for personality out of the front-of-house staff, but in a city with as many sushi places as Madison, it certainly doesn't hut. Godzilla roll is great, they have the best avocado rolls in the city and their miso creme brûlée is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer of Shinji Muramoto's restaurants and have always had a good to great experience.

However, my meal at Sushi Muramoto this last weekend was not up to par.  I've eaten the miso marinated black cod more times than I can count, and this time, the flavor was plain off. 

The dish also suffered from poorly washed bok choy.  I had a small amount of sand in my food early in, but pushed through.  I was with several ladies, celebrating, and did not want to send my food back since I was already behind them (they had sushi, which was served first).  I kept going (big mistake) and near the end, chomped down on a small rock - just large enough to do some serious tooth damage. I, who in my 30 years have never had a cavity, am now experiencing my first dental pain.  I think I'm going to have to get a filling as a result, since I can't eat or brush without sharp pain from the top of my tooth, thanks to some poorly trained kitchen help who failed to thoroughly wash their produce. 

I realize it's hard to get dirt and sand out of bunched greens, but if I can do it in my home kitchen, I expect the pros to be able to do it, too."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison, but we're in the Midwest, not the coasts. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth it if you love sushi. I go nowhere else for sushi in this town."}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi here and great prices actually. Four rolls is a huge meal for me and my wife to enjoy, and we've even ordered some for take out occasionally to skate the permanent crowds inside. 

5 stars for great food at Sushi Muramoto!"}
{"text":"I really love their hot and sour soup, I've never had anything like it elsewhere!  They use high-quality fish for their sushi, so their nigiri and sashimi are tastier than other sushi places in Madison.

Two things prevent me from giving this restaurant five stars (and they are both just based on my personal preferences): I don't love their spicy tuna roll - it's a little too spicy for my taste (I prefer Wasabi's spicy tuna roll instead).  I also wish they offered a sweet potato tempura roll (their veggie tempura roll is just carrots and asparagus).

If you are looking for quantity and quality - it's particularly worthwhile to go during the day for their lunch specials."}
{"text":"We've lived on the coast, so that may bias our opinion on sushi, we're used to the best.  This was barely OK.

Pros:  Service.  The service was bright, friendly and wonderful.
The salmon in my rainbow roll was OK.
The asparagus roll was good, as far as a veggie roll goes.

Cons:
The edamame was served cold.  Not just cold, but partially frozen.
The seaweed salad was a little seaweed on top of a lot of mixed greens.  That's a mixed green salad w/seaweed, not a seaweed salad.
The tuna was FISHY, really fishy.  To the point where I could not finish it, and I love sushi.   The scallop roll also tasted more than a little off.
No brown rice available.

Weird:
Iced Green Tea is something they've never heard of. 

The place *was* packed, but I also noticed guys with beards and no hair protection making rolls.  That always throws me for a loop.  I get it, a beard snood is not an attractive thing...but neither is beard hair in the sushi.  Although I will stress I did not find any or anything.

Again, the service was delightful.  Our waitress was so nice, it made me wish I'd like this place more.  Ah well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Madison. Their tempura shrimp appetizer with asparagus and wasabi sauce is amazing!!!! Their plum wine also goes very well with their sushi, and the edamame tastes excellent too. A bit crowded inside, but otherwise awesome food."}
{"text":"I feel bad leaving a \"meh, I've experienced better\" review for Muramoto. But, I have definitely experienced better.  *At* Muramoto!  (Both locations.)  Posting this review in the hopes it helps them up their game a little.

We stopped by for lunch around 11:45 on a Sunday and it was nowhere near as busy as I usually see it.  Were seated right away (also unusual -- I've usually experienced at least a few minutes' wait).  I thought, \"This is great!  We'll be in and out and on our way in plenty of time to catch a movie!\"  Maybe I jinxed us.

We got waters and menus right away, but that was where the good service ended.  A server never appeared.  We didn't actually notice for quite awhile because we were having a fun time talking amongst ourselves, but one of us looked at our watch and realized we'd been there 25 minutes with no service after the waters we grew a little concerned.  

Just as we were starting to realize we'd been there such a long time, we overheard the table to one side of us was complaining that they hadn't been served what they ordered.  The table on the other side was having a conversation about how long it'd been since they'd last seen their server...

Given that we had other plans for the day, we made a collective decision to just get up and leave!  Which I have never, ever done before.  I was pretty disappointed because I love their food.  But given it wasn't clear if/when we'd receive any (or, based on the neighboring table's experience, that we'd actually get what we'd ordered?) we gave up on lunch there and just went and got sandwiches.  Meh indeed!"}
{"text":"Got take out sushi today - half of the avocado was brown - like really brown.  If this is a sushi place you would think the products they use in AVOCODO sushi would be fresh.  Or at least call the customer & say that the avocados aren't good - would you like something else.  Not just send the product on it's way - my hubby picked it up - so not sure if he even looked at it before taking it.  I would have taken one look & refused it.  Got all the way home & it just looked gross - feel really bad cause my little daughter was the one that wanted it .  We picked out the good ones & tossed the rest.  Now - saying this to the manager - he didn't even offer a refund or an apology - second manager did - & offered an apology which the first manager didn't even offer.  Really disappointing.  Feeling sick  with stomach pains - which is what prompted me to call.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We tried eating in the restaurant again and not one of the staff were wearing a fragrance.  I don't know if they made a change or it was luck, but it was a very pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto is a popular place and the food is good, but I really hate how there are at least 6 tables that have one or more seats facing the pickup window to the kitchen. The business side of the restaurant needs to be addressed, I can think of much more attractive scenery than the reminder notes to staff and the credit card terminal. It's a small place and I'm not sure where they go, but our server was MIA during the most critical period- I hate waiting for the check. Makes me feel like a hostage."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town.  Favorite dishes: spicy shrimp roll & shrimp tempura appitizer.  Food is always fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Madison. The sushi menu is just as good as the entrees. My favorite roll is the Godzilla. They also have a great cocktail menu."}
{"text":"This place is a very solid choice. We came here on a weeknight on a trip, and the location here was appealing because we could walk around after dinner.

The decor inside is very sharp and clean. They have a full bar, and a good-sized menu. Our crab cakes were delicious. I was pleased with my \"Tarantula\" and \"Godzilla\" rolls; pretty comparable to what I've had at other places. We all shared a plum wine. Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact name, but it was tasty!"}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants.  I really enjoy the sushi they have their, and their entrees as well.  I ordered the salmon entree, and while the salmon itself didn't have the most flavor, it came with a lot of delicious veggies that I enjoyed.  The sushi, though, was fantastic!!! My friends and I ordered two Maki Combos ($20 dollars each), and it came with a special roll and three other rolls, all chef's choice.  We got such a variety (and the chef definitely knows his/her stuff), but the best part is that the sushi had so much flavor, it definitely did not need any wasabi or soy sauce to add to the flavor.  Good job Sushi Muramoto!  The only gripe I had was that the service was a bit slow.  I got my fish entree later than the table next to me, and they also ordered a fish entree but got here after us.  Other than that, the food is delicious, and definitely get the Maki Combo, it's the best \"bang for your buck\"."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi in Madison, either the King st or Hilldale locations.
It's creative in the right ways and not in the overdone sugary sauce and incompatible ingredient way. Sushi has gotten a bit out of hand in the US.
Their fish is first rate, often off of the whole fish rather than from prepackaged fish factories who supply supermarkets for their awful offerings."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food I ordered was below average.  Reading people's comments about the rice made me pay special attention - I agree with those who think the rice they use for their rolls is like Uncle Ben's, kinda bland plus it's VERY sticky.  I had the California roll which was really bland and flavorless, usually it's one of my favorites.  I actually thought maybe the rice was contributing to its blandness and tried scooping out and just eating the insides without the rice (the crab, avocado and cucumber) to see if that helped, and that was very bland too.  I also tried the soft shell crab roll, that was just okay, I think the fried tempura stuff made it more flavorful. My favorite was the tuna avocado roll, that one was pretty good if you could try not to pay attention to the rice.   Incidentally, and nothing to do with the food, but if you turn the faucet on too quickly in the sink in the women's restroom a large gush of water comes out and splashes up the sink all over your shirt. Not that it happened to me."}
{"text":"Equal to its downtown neighbor but in a less desirable location."}
{"text":"Bad service and mediocre sushi. Stick to sushi when you are on the ocean --- the midwest and sushi don't mix. 

Sashimi was OK, Godzilla roll was good and Rainbow roll was bad."}
{"text":"I have had lunch and dinner here a hand full of times. The sushi is always fresh and flavorful. The ambience could be better..the seating is a little tight and cramped but as are many sushi joints..guess this may just come with the territory. I suggest the Godzilla specialty roll!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but this restaurant's sushi is not worth the price.  You are better off spending your money at Ginza.  It was maybe a step above grocery store sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto was my first restaurant experience in Madison.  Since then I've eaten here several times.  

The sushi is really very good and I thoroughly enjoy their seaweed salad.  The dining quarters when busy feel a bit cramped but comfortable.  Comfort is important here because regardless of how busy they are the wait is always long. 

If you're up for the wait, the menu is good and provides sufficient options for those who love or dislike sushi.  

The price prevents me from eating here more often and when I decide to go, I always go in off-hours so I can get in AND out in a reasonable amount of time.

It's certainly worth going once.  After that, if you have a pet sushi place with more reasonable prices you may wanna just stick to it."}
{"text":"If I had to rate sushi bars in Madison Sushi Muramota would come in third or fourth. (1st: Red, 2nd: Fuji) 

Here is my issue with Sushi Muramota. When I plan to eat raw fish at a place I expect the place to be immaculate. The level of cleanliness has to be way better than a standard restaurant that cooks your food. On maybe the 4th or 5th time I went there we sat at the sushi bar and I just felt the bar was dirty and the cooler where they keep the fish was not up to my standards. That completely turned me off and I have been unable to go back. Maybe it was just that day or it's just me but with other sushi options in the area I don't plan on going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto gets our vote for the best restaurant in Madison. Consitantly deliver excellent quality, service, and flavor. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we have had in a long time.  A little more expensive than other places, but worth it."}
{"text":"Singularly the worst sushi I have eaten....I ordered bluefin, yellowfin and salmon sashimi. Besides the bluefin, the fish didn't look fresh , the texture wasn't good either. Someone made a comment that their rice is like Uncle Ben's - I couldn't have said it better myself. So bland and so not sticky. The miso soup wasn't bad but it is impossible to screw that up....well, almost! I've had good sushi in the Midwest notably Cleveland but this is definitely not the place to go...order pizza instead.
Madison, you deserve better!"}
{"text":"A good sushi joint, but I wouldn't miss it if it were to close down. I've been here probably five times, each time I would leave feeling satisified but also couldn't help but feel like something was missing.

The atmosphere, though cramped, is nice. The host staff are also courteous. I have never understood that my party, usually of two, is always seated in between two other occupied tables in the setting of many open seats. A bit uncomfortable when considering the possibility of spreading out in this tight space.

On average, the service and delivery of food here is slow compared to competitors downtown and the west side of Madison. It takes a while for a wait staff to come to your table, and once the food is delivered, it seems like follow up to check for satisfaction is missed.

The food is good, not great. There are some unique nigiri options here not found at competitors. I enjoy some of the house specialty sushi rolls as well. I find, however, the ingredients used for the sushi can be sketchy. The avocado is probably the best example, where it is either too ripe, or not yet ripe.

Again a good sushi place, and your money wont be wasted, but, I've had better in this wonderful town."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Madison. My husbands second. We love visiting here and enjoying fresh sushi and good drinks. Yes, it's expensive, but hey, you get what you pay for and this place is worth the cost. Everything we've ever tried here has been very good to excellent. Their special rolls are excellent. I know we love the Godzilla. I can't remember other names. Their scallop appetizer is amazing too. They have an excellent bar selection as well. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place has real nice ambiance (4 star) and the sushi was ok (3.5 star) not great. This place is family friendly and also intimate enough for a nice date night. The experience could have been better but I felt my server was not people friendly, so I don't want to skew this review based on 1 experience (2 star my experience). I think the food and service isn't indicative of my personal experience, but not sure if I'd try this place again since there are many other choices in town."}
{"text":"Wow i found good sushi no where near the ocean. 

But be prepared to pay. The same type of nigiri in LA is doubled here. The fish is fresh and i didn't get sick afterwards a big plus. I had some European guests dining with me and they were so surprised of how good this place was. Hot and Sour soup is not like your typical soup you would find in like a panda express or any other Chinese fast food. We had the sashimi combo chefs choice. Good variety of fish it didn't seem like leftovers the chefs were trying to pawn off before it went bad. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Smaller than their down town restaurant but it has the same great atmosphere. 

The nigiri and sashimi were great. Their tuna and freshwater eel is outstanding. I also enjoyed the hot and sour soup it was incredibly rich. 

The only let down was there special roll called the \"Ecuador\", for 16 dollars I was expecting something better tasting and with more protein. 

A thing that bothered me with the ambience, was the bathroom's air duct in the ceiling had a quarter inch of dust on it. The food was good enough that I cleaned it up my self, but it is a little things like that which make people question the cleanliness of a facility."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our steaks and drinks. I only gave 4 stars because we arrived at 1:30 and didn't get our food until 2:30. I was starving! We should have ordered an appetizer but we didn't know it would take that long. We're wondering if they were short staffed today due to the Taste of Madison or something. The workers who were there were very clearly working hard. Again, we enjoyed our meals. High quality and fantastic flavors."}
{"text":"I owe them an update. Since last winter, I have been going to Muramoto often with one of their most regular customers and their service was great every time. Once I figured out what I liked and explored more of the cooked items on the menu, it was really a pleasure to eat here. There is usually a wait around dinner time every night but it's nice that they have a whole bar section where you can start with a nice sapporo draft with some takowasa! ;)"}
{"text":"Can't remember how many times I came with my friends. Very good quality of food, fresh, and authentic. Wish the price could be lower..,"}
{"text":"I usually come here before a movie at Sundance, but after my experience on Sunday 4/6/14, this will be my last visit to Sushi Muramoto.

Sushi Muramoto and King Muramoto have different menus, and we came here for the lunch specials. Our friends specifically mentioned they wanted their food as soon as possible, while late-comers like my boyfriend and I and two other friends could eat our food at a leisurely pace. It was essential because we had a movie at the Wisconsin Film Fest and wanted to get the best seats possible.

The waiter acknowledged the request, yet after 30 minutes of wait time, the entrees have not arrived. Apparently, our request was ignored, and all entrees were served together, alongside with those for the latecomers.

The only meal that my boyfriend and I had for Sunday, and also till 4 days later (today). We shared the Black Cod Miso and the Hanger Steak. The afternoon following the meal, I experienced severe food poisoning symptoms and so did my boyfriend, the same night. I do not think it was the hanger steak as several of our other friends ordered that dish. However, one of my other friends who had the Black Cod Miso experienced mild food poisoning symptoms like being bloated and loss of appetite. 

I do not wish to claim that Sushi Muramoto has a trend of poor food hygiene as I have eaten there previously. However, the poor service and terrible reaction I have had to the food has me resolved never to return to this location again. 

P.S. As an adventurous eater, I have never had such severe food poisoning symptoms for as long as I can remember. Definitely not within the last 15 years, even when I explored countries of much poorer hygiene standards."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi... Have been here twice.  LOVE the escolar!!!  Also very much appreciate that the waiters knew what was gluten free and brought me wheat free soy sauce."}
{"text":"Today (3/31/18) none of the kitchen staff are wearing gloves while handling food: They're opening the display to take fish out or put it back in, rolling sushi, and putting it on the plate with their bare hands; the same hands they use to scratch their head or who knows what else. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Look, sushi in Madison is never going to compare to Chicago/LA/NYC/Japan, etc., but this is not bad at all. I always get the sashimi platter, plus a roll or two. May try going with some of the non-sushi/sashimi dishes at some point."}
{"text":"Inventive, delicious & gorgeous...Sushi Muramoto is our favorite sushi place in Madison. 

You get what you pay for, and since cost is a concern for us, we hit them at lunch for the specials!!!  Same great food, but at a lower price, and I've gotten out of there for $6 at lunch!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying, this place is hard to find. We knew the general area and bc it had no signage, we drove by it a couple times before spotting the small name plate on the door. 

Went here for lunch with a party of 6. We were seated in one of the back rooms with a single table. It was nice and cozy. We were promptly served.

We ordered the shrimp tempura, calamari, pork belly, and crab cakes for appetizers. Everything was good, but the shrimp tempura was amazing. This shrimp tempura was not your typical deep fried sushi place kind of deal... It was smothered in this sauce that was delicious. We also ordered the hanger steak, chicken teriyaki, 2 tarantula rolls, 2 godzilla rolls, 1 soft shell roll, 1 Ecuador, and 1 rainbow. My favorite was the godzilla roll, but all were good. Presentation was kind of lacking, but food was fine. Everybody in our party enjoyed the lunch and will probably come again should we be in the area and want sushi."}
{"text":"Today, I wet to Muramoto with my Japanese friends for lunch. I ate hanger steak lunch, and my two friends had sushi. I was hoping good lunch, but it was a big disappointment. My steak was full of  gristle and hard to eat. I order this hanger steak because I remember my friend was enjoying this menu a bout a year ago. When I complained about the quality of the meat, she told me she had the similar experience half a year ago. She said she stopped ordering the dish any more since then. And other thing we noticed was the type of the rice they used for the side of hanger steak, it was long grain rice. OK, it's a side of the steak, maybe it's acceptable. But to our surprise, the sushi rice my friends were eating was also long grain rice, which is not acceptable. Sushi should be made with short grain rice called Japonica. That is the best sushi rice. If they use California medium grain rice, that is acceptable, but today's rice was long grain rice!! We could not believe they use long grain rice for sushi. This is not super market sushi, this is sushi served at Sushi restaurant. We were thinking Muramoto is the best sushi restaurant in Madison until today. The owner is Japanese person, and he should know better. This is not a sushi restaurant owned by non-Japanese like some other sushi restaurants in Madison. Why have they lowered their quality of food here? Do they think they can fool the customers because nobody will notice the difference? I was disappointed very much today."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, attentive service, great atmosphere. The selection is huge! The bunny sake is good, too. I was glad to see both shrimp rolls AND salmon skin rolls. I also had the coffee créme brûlée, which was subtle and delectable. Definitely a place to return to!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Delicious food. Went here with a group from work. It was quite busy and about an hour wait. Well worth it though. I had two vegetarian rolls and thoroughly enjoyed them both."}
{"text":"$20 I got negihama, negiTORO!! Plus a special fire roll. It's chef's choice dinner combo so i was so happy they were what I'd hand picked. But better, because it's a surprise.Thank you!!The sashimi plate was delicious also with thick cut fish."}
{"text":"Service has declined since they've gotten more popular, I've been a customer for 6 years now and still get treated rudely by receptionists."}
{"text":"Joined the wife for a belated birthday dinner where we sat at the sushi bar.  I would say a quiet dinner but the dining room is hopping on a Wednesday night. Ordered Bell's Two-Hearted in bottles and started with the Miso soup. Menu is varied with the old standards and some real innovative special rolls. We settled on bonito and snow crab nigiri, smoked salmon and philly rolls and a special roll of yellow tail, tuna and jalapenos called the Ecuador. Stars of the show were the snow crab and the Ecuador.  The snow crap was incredibly sweet and tender, an incredible texture and taste. The Ecuador was nestled in srirachi and aoili with a tangy jalapeno in the roll crusted with tempura flakes which set off the texture perfectly. Didn't need wasabi or ginger for this one.  After another Two-Hearted considered getting more snow crab sweet enough to dessert but went for a delicious chocolate creme brulee."}
{"text":"Decent but overpriced. Affected service that thinks highly of themselves. Oh, and fails to be accommodating, even 5 star restaurants do take-out on occasion...."}
{"text":"Had another good trip to Muramoto tonight.

SUMMARY: Fresh and tasty food, great atmosphere, serving sizes may be decreasing? (meat, particularly), Maggie is a cool server.

- Calamari($8): Breading is excellent - Not too crunchy, definitely not soggy, just a tiny bit of \"crisp\" and \"crunch\" when you bite in. The serving size is pretty big - maybe one of the best \"bang for your buck\" items on the menu however, I DO think that the amount of calamari in our order had decreased from last visit.The saltiness and greasiness are perfect in my opinion, meaning they are both a bit on the high end so be prepared for richness. On a final note, these have always come at an ideal temperature when I've ordered them. They don't seem to forget and leave calamari plates lying around in back or anything, but it also seems like they strategically let the dish cool after removing it from the fryer and before bringing it to the table. I would expect your order to come to the table at 120F-135F.

 - Tekka($5) and Salmon($4) rolls: Fresh rice, fresh and \"hardy\" seaweed,The meat:rice ratio on the maki wasn't terribly impressive but the meat was fresh and tasty as well.

Atmosphere was awesome. I love the lighting at this place - getting to sit at the bar and watch the chefs roll stuff up is always fun! It seems like Muramoto has been 70%-95% full on each of the three weekend nights I've been, too. (Its busy, almost full, but we've been seated immediately each time. I don't know if this is fantastic ninjalike management and utilization of the space available or if it was just coincidence.)

Special shoutout to our waitress, Maggie. No anaphylactic shocks from horseradish allergies. Quick service. Thanks Maggie. :)"}
{"text":"3rd Sushi is a charm? 
I've eaten lunch here three times, each has been the same experience.
Polite and attentive staff. Clean and pleasant atmosphere.  
Lunch special has been perfect, with Chef's choice on rolls.
Hot tea and water glasses refilled, it all worked smoothly.
Maybe smooth is what I can say as a takeaway.
The food was beautifully presented and tasted fresh.
It's not the best sushi I have ever eaten, but I would give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"After dropping a phone off at the Apple store for a battery change (yes, it tales 2.5 hours), we found ourselves with 2.5 hours to kill with rumbling bellies.  We wondered across the street in search of some food and decided to have a sushi lunch.  We have been here before, so we knew it should be good.

Not surprising, the place was hopping with a room full of packed tables.  Lucky for us, there was a two top open with our name on it...

We ordered a couple of the lunch specials The Spicy Shrimp and a Dragon Roll.

The Spicy Shrimp was piping hot and had just the right amount of heat.  The portion was very generous for a lunch special, but perfect to share along with a special roll.  The shrimps were surprisingly large and cooked perfectly!  There shrimp was mixed with traditional onion, peppers and sprouts with a side of rice and a strange salad topped with corn flakes.

The Dragon roll was off the special roll menu, it was a bit pricey for what we got, but it was a pretty tasty roll- filled with Shrimp Tempura, avocado, and cream cheese.  It was topped with an eel type sauce and a spicy mayo with black fish roe.  It wasn't my favorite roll, but it was worth trying.

While Sushi Mutamoto isn't my favorite sushi joint in town, but it's a solid joint that does not disappoint!  It's a bit too spendy for my blood, but a great place to get a lunch at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison and my hands down 1st choice for quality sushi in Madison. First of all this place is located in the Hilldale mall near a lot of great shops. Yes there isnt much parking near the restaurant but there is always parking in the Hilldale parking lot. The place has a great vibe to it, very modern. I've eaten here a number of times and all of their rolls are superb. Maybe once out of the 20+ times I've eaten here the unagi wasnt that great but it was only once.  Yes its kind of pricey but they do have discounted sushi specials for chefs choice during lunch and dinner. They have great options for small appetizer dishes that are super yummy and a lychee martini that is killer. The sake selection is kind of pricy but all really great quality. Anywhere else I would give this place a solid 3 stars but since Madison has so many limited options for great sushi I'll add another star. I'm so glad this place exists in Madison!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. I loooooove the nigri here (more hamachi por favor!). This used to be my ex's and my go-to restaurant for... really anything and everything. He's left Madison now but I still stop in regularly. Their lunch special is pretty freaking awesome too =)

Avoid the hot and sour soup but everything else I've had here is great."}
{"text":"The place gets really busy, so be prepared to wait. They have a new separate lounge where you can get drinks and snacks while you wait, though I wasn't crazy about the bar snack selection. The drinks are pretty good. Or if you're lucky, you can grab a seat at the restaurant bar and order menu items from there. 

The selection of sushi/sashimi is pretty good. Nice variety to choose from. If you don't have strong preferences on fish, the combo platters are nice because you get a variety, but it is chef's choice. Same goes for the maki combo plates. Depending on the server you get, some will ask if there are strong likes/dislikes of any fish. 

They also have a decent menu of fusion items. The miso cod is really great. Though I wish they would do something with the rice instead of leaving it plain. The steak is also really good, though not a huge fan of the potato salad that comes with it, but it can be easily swapped out. Their appetizers are all really good too. The scallops, the crab cakes and the pork belly are steady favorites. The miso soup can sometimes be a bit too salty (I really like salt, so that's saying a lot). 

Overall, in terms of sushi in Madsion, Sushi Muramoto is as good as you're going to find. Afterall, WI is not a coastal state, so the quality of fish will never compare to say, SF or Seattle. But they do ok here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times & it's still my favorite place in the MSN area for sushi, sashimi, and nigiri.  
What I love most about sushi Murimoto is that they don't over complicate their food. Some of the other sushi places in the area, their food looks like a well finished product.  They take a good basic roll and over complicate it with extra ingredients it doesn't need. It looks great. But we all know how that can be. Not so good.
At Sushi Muramoto, they don't do that. Ever. Every roll I've ever had there has been completely non complicated. But the flavor when simple ingredients come together. There isn't a word to describe it."}
{"text":"We ate at Sushi Muramota before attending a movie at the Sundance Theater. The location is literally across the street from the theater. The restaurant was packed but they were able to seat us at the bar. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the bar. Beautiful stone wall; warm colors, busy but not loud. Fun place to be with lots of people coming and going.

The drink menu includes numerous sakes including a tasting flight. After the flight, our server/bartender recommended a different bottle of sake and it was delicious. Excellent recommendation. Our server/bartender was friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable about both the menu and the bar.

The sushi tasted fresh. There was a little more wasabi on each piece than I prefer and the prices were a bit high, but it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town! Good for sushi lives and non sushi lovers alike.  Wonderful raw and non raw options.  The tempura, the hanger steak, and the sushi are excellent."}
{"text":"Love their lunch menu. Our personal favorite-Beef hanger steak. I love the crab cakes as well. The sushi and maki roll are always fresh. There's always a wait when u go here and ur food might take longer than usual but it's quite worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"They should focus less on being trendy and hard to find and more on making amazing sushi.

 The place was cold and dark and hip. I got lost coming back from the bathroom.
The sushi rice was loose and falling apart and the fish was tasteless.
My avocado roll was okay.
The hot and sour soup rocked!
The veggie tempura only contained two types of veggie. One of those veggies was a thick raw carrot. Lame. 

My boyfriend and I were super dissatisfied and peaced out as soon as we got the bill.
Don't go here. Unless of course you dig being served terrible sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint at Hilldale. You cannot beat their lunch specials. My personal fave is the chef's choice of 3 rolls for $10. Yes, TEN dollars. It includes one veggie, one seafood and then one random. It's the best lunch deal around. The seaweed salad is hit and miss and can quickly double your lunch bill at an additional $7.

The restaurant is small and fills up quickly, but if there's room, sit at the sushi bar! The guys are super nice and always willing to answer any questions!"}
{"text":"This is, without doubt, the best sushi I've had in Madison. It is pricier than other sushi places around town but you definitely get what you pay for. The atmosphere is probably what you call \"trendy\" but still manages to remain inviting and comfortable. The service is very attentive and friendly. The real highlight, though, is the sushi itself, which is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The rolls are also great; I particularly recommend the salmon and avocado roll."}
{"text":"Having been here for only a few times but do truly get impressed by the quality of sushi served here. The price is a little high, but the special rolls and combination plates we ordered did prove that we got what we paid for. The environment of the Sushi Muramoto is also very nice, suitable for either casually dining with friends or meeting with business partners. Overall, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Lunch and sushi specials from 11am-3pm.  Can't say I've tried anything else other than the sushi.  3 rolls for $25 can't be beat.  Well, it can when it adds up to eating there 4x a week for two weeks straight.  You do the math, I really don't want to think about the cost too much."}
{"text":"There are few places in Madison where you can get a better for lunch for the price. For $12 you get a plate of delicious hanger steak, potatoes, and side house salad (which is crazy creative and I wish I would have thought of the recipe myself it's so good). Enjoy all of that in the cool restaurant atmosphere and you have yourself one great lunch!

For those of you who, like me, can't get enough sushi, the sashimi plate and Muramoto roll are just the things to curb that never-ending sushi craving for the day. Then you'll probably want to comes back for another round the next day. It's a good idea to split these dishes between two people. The sashimi plate comes with a side of rice that has dried shiso leaf sprinkled on top. Never had this combo before, and it is so welcomed! The dried shiso adds a nice delicate, herbal flavor to the savory sticky rice. Yummmm. The variety of fish the sushi chef picked was all wonderful. I couldn't pick a favorite because it was all so good in its own way. The Muramoto roll is a party in itself. Egg paper--can't imaging how they make that!--enrobes rice, shrimp, shiso and some other delicious things and is topped with a mound of salmon roe. Hard to beat that!"}
{"text":"I've been to both restaurants that they have.  It was very good both locations.  I have a limited sushi palate.  I stay with tuna, salmon, and crab.  But I have always been satisfied with what I have ordered, even if I veer into something new.  I had a group of 8, and I had to change reservation times on them for lunch, and they were very accommodating, and there was no wait when we showed up."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Madison.  Costs a pretty penny.  Some waiters were really weak over the 15-20 times I have been there.  Including an instance where we had a party of 16 and asked in advance to have each order billed separately.  The waiter insisted that it would be much easier to break up at the end.  When we finished he presented us with one bill, undivided and we ended up spending the next hour (not an exaggeration) break up the bill properly.

But it's so good, especially like the high quality Miso soup, the Shrimp tempura appetizer (when it includes enough hot sauce, sometimes it has none and is a lot weaker) and generally high quality fish."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi expert, but everything about this place is great.  The setting, design, service, food.  Everything is as it should be.  Priced fair in my opinion.  My favorite place in town."}
{"text":"I haven't felt compelled to review anything in a while, so it sucks that this review needed to come out.

I am a frequent customer at Sushi Muramoto.  They have the best Japanese food in Madison (don't LOL too much outsiders).  I usually order to go, but have dined in many times also.

They have a wonderful sushi menu that consistently delivers in plating, flavor, texture and punch.  Without going overboard (remember were still in Madison... we're NOT the sushi capital of the world, but it's real good all things considered), I have never had a roll, nigiri or sashimi there that I wouldn't rinse (with ginger) and repeat.  

I have become very partial to their lunch menu. 

It's cheap, delicious and provides a little fusion fun. Better yet, it's a HUGE bargain.  My favorite on the menu is their hanger steak.  For $9.00 you get a solid amount of seared tender meat coated in an Asian barbecue sauce, a side of well-dressed rice and amazing potato salad [with decadent hints of wasabi and honey and ikura (which surprisingly works)]. Besides that, you get a wonderful salad with the most addictive dressing I've had. 

Why only three stars?

I've eaten here dozens of times, but my returns have been far less frequent.  The problem is the disorganization up front.  

As referenced earlier, I am a \"to go\" customer. I order to go  because I live very close.  The weekend lunch hostess is a hot mess and I never experienced anything like this with any establishment. 

For a restaurant that focuses on such perfection on nearly all aspects of its food and decor, can't get a glaring weakness right upfront.  

1) Their order completion times for generally short turn around orders are insane (they give 45 minutes to an hour for pick up times).

2) If you call any time for lunch, expect that your food will not be finished when they tell you a certain time.  The last several times, I left home when it was due and still waited 15 minutes for takeout at the restaurant. 

3) You have to review your orders like a hawk.  There are frequent mistakes made on relatively simple orders (for example, missing salads).

It's a given... they are ALWAYS busy, but the problem is the hostess that has worked the last few months or so.  #1 has been a problem for years. However, #'s 2 and 3 have popped up with the new hostess. It's not a growing pain issue because her lack of attention to detail and atrocious time management have been getting worse and are completely unacceptable and negatively impact my overall feelings of this restaurant; in fact, there's no perceived sense of urgency from her.  The more this continues, the less likely I'll come back to this otherwise great (although very pretentious) establishment. 

Note:  The dine in service is slow and a couple people seem to be walking around aimlessly on the floor, but it's not as severe as anything up front.

Tips: 
For lunch takeout...
1) I would not order unless you have at least an hour to wait.
2) If you go there before it's ready and seats are available, pop a squat at the bar and play with your phone (might as well get comfortable and not stand like a fool at the front counter as mobs try to run around/thru you).
3.) If you live close, force them to call you to pick up the food to avoid the aggravation of waiting when you know that your food wasn't even started by the time you get there."}
{"text":"Sushi Muarmoto is my favorite sushi place. That being said, I've never had sushi on the coast. Just various places around Madison. I'm also not a sushi fanatic. But I was very impressed with the crab cake lunch and Godzilla roll. If you want to dip your toes in a sushi experience I'd start here."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 pieces nigiri sushi and 3 rolls, while waiting for the rolls we had an amazing vegetable tempura appetizer! However, all the while waiting we watched the sushi chef eating behind the sushi bar (the white chef) while continuing to cut the vegetables WITHOUT GLOVES. It completely turned the nice dining into a place I don't want to go again. It's too bad because I used to think they had very professional staff. Just a warning, please train your su-chefs better."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison, hands down.

The guys at Sushi Muramoto do it best. The staff is always professional, attentive, and polite. I have never had a problem getting seated here as a walk-in. They have an extensive beverage menu, including many varieties of sake as well as wines and beers. Ironically, my favorite item on the menu is the Miso Black Cod. The cod is marinated in miso and broiled to an almost buttery texture. It is served with a side of bok choy, cauliflower, and eggplant in a deliciously - once again - buttery sauce. It is also delivered with a side of rice with spice on top - yum! A total umami experience.

Another favorite of mine on the menu is the Muramoto Roll - tuna, sweet shrimp, squid, shiso, sprouts, and salmon roe wrapped in egg paper and topped with a spicy shiso mayo. It's extremely unique and well-portioned for the price. Usually it comes very quickly. However, once, I was dining here with my mother and the lunch rush took over at full force. It took the sushi a little longer to come out but our lovely waiter compensated for it. Great service!"}
{"text":"I am a fan... but I cannot afford to go back there unless it is for a very special occasion. 

I will say this the service was good. 
It was my first time eating at a Japanese restaurant and I loved it I will try others though to see if they are just as good but for less money. 

But on a nice date with my husband... and if we have enough saved... yes I would go back :)"}
{"text":"don't get me wrong, this place's food is not bad. just a bit overpriced for the quality. for example, $12 for a piece of black cod, rice, some salad with cornflakes, bok choy, and So. Much. Sauce.
food: mediocre, too much sauce, very americanized...i thought this place was supposed to serve japanese food?
bathroom: water too cold, didn't turn to hot quickly, curtains hanging are dirty, maybe change them (:
seating: cheap, wooden, tables are wobbly, i mean maybe provide some cushions to sit on...
utensils: wooden chopsticks? even panera uses metal silverware...
price not worth the quality...
the water-filling and service was good, i suppose.
overall if you are looking for a place to chat with friends and eat some sushi that is overpriced but doesn't seem to faze anyone, this is the perfect place."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed my several visits to Muramoto. Sushi and sashimi are of good quality. Service is good. Sake menu is very respectable. Their nigiri pieces come with a little too much wasabi in my opinion but what do I know? I have not yet tried the non-sushi dishes. Will return to try."}
{"text":"I occasionally debate about the best sushi place in the Madison area. Usually it comes down to either Red or Muramoto, but for my money, Muramoto is the winner.

Never had bad or even sub-par sushi here. It's always beyond delectable, and if you're not picky, you can get three excellent rolls for just 25 bucks with the \"Chef's Choice\" special.

My only complaint is how they gouge you on drinks. Buying a 25 oz. carafe of decent sake there is upwards of 40 dollars, while I can find the exact same stuff at Woodman's for about half the price. I get they need to make money off of it, but there's a limit."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star place for me. I had a lunch combo that gets you 2 special rolls for $25. I chose rainbow and caterpillar. They were okay. Ingredients were fresh enough but not impressively so. The portion was not stingy but not very generous either - the roll could've used more avocado. I know a bunch of sushi places elsewhere in the states that serve much better dishes for the same price, but perhaps if you're looking for a sushi place within Madison this place is acceptable."}
{"text":"OK - so normally one doesn't think of Sushi as \"vegetarian\" but..... C'MON!!!

It was good but not great - nothing about their vegetarian options screamed....get back here the next time you want some roles. Complete lack of flavor, complete lack of thought - simply COMPLETELY LACKING!

I hope that doesn't sound mean as that is not my point...my point is that with the world changing as it is and vegetarian's becoming more and more prevalent I would think more \"upscale\" restaurants would be jumping on board and offering a higher class of dining options than an asparagus role!

I want to give it another star for \"atmosphere\" but alas...even that wasn't overly impressive. I am sure that the regular \"meaty\" roles are fantastic but if you or someone in your party is vegetarian...look elsewhere unless, you want poorly assembled single vegetable roles (one exception) the vegetable tempura role which was ok but still completely lacking in creativity and honestly taste then by all means stop on by."}
{"text":"I have hit this spot about 5 times now. I have only been to one other Sushi joint that could compare to this restaurant. Super fresh seafood and great tasty specialty rolls. Place is in a new outdoor mall and the inside has a nice atmosphere and bar that you can dine at. We went there on a Sunday night and you would of  thought it was a Friday or Saturday from the busy crowd. Definitely a Madison hit. Hits the spot in all categories."}
{"text":"My experience at Sushi Muramoto in Hilldale was fairly disappointing.

My friend and I went on a weeknight and shared a plate of nigiri and a couple of rolls for filler. Our edamame appetizer was nice. She had a lemon drop cocktail that was proclaimed good, and my Sapporo was just fine.

Sushi is all about the fish and the quality here did not live up to the prices. I was served a piece of salmon that I knew was not good enough to be sushi grade by looks alone. The Spanish Mackerel lacked sharpness and dimension. Freshwater eel was room temperature and overly sweet. Other nigiri were fine, but forgettable. 

The two rolls my friend and I shared were good -- the Yellowtail and scallion roll and pickled radish roll were great.

Service was O.K.; however, for the price, I expect better fish. I don't know how much of this I can put down to sushi in Wisconsin but hey, planes fly everywhere so there's not much of an excuse. I don't recommend Sushi Muramoto."}
{"text":"Beautifully understated transcendental decor completely compliments the visually arresting and thoroughly satisfying menu offerings. It was perfect place to take my wife on her birthday and we threw caution to the wind and ordered whatever we wanted, without fear or favor. Very nice West side establishment."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this but I think this is Madison's best sushi place.  That is because they have more than sushi and they have a decent bar.  Speaking of the bar, I mean the bar to drink at...not the sushi bar. The bar scene is fun though quite cramped.  They'd be smart to take out some seats and expand it.  They have had some some good bartenders over the years and some lean years too unfortunately.  But sit there.  I'm serious.  The sushi is usually good. Their rolls are great.  Many are spicy which I like.  Tarantula is great if the soft shells are fresh.  I also like the rainbow...beautiful construction and presentation.  Service can be slow.  Staff range from fair to great.  Forget what I said about the bar.  Don't sit there.  Or if you do save me a place."}
{"text":"I read a few reviews of this place that said \"good as long as you're from the midwest\".

I'm not from the Midwest. I've never lived more than 5 miles from the ocean. I've eaten my fair share of great sushi and Sushi Muramoto deserves five stars.

The fish was fresh and the menu was comprehensive. They also do something most NYC sushi restaurants don't: offer fresh grated wasabi.

If you like sushi you should eat here. It's good, period."}
{"text":"My husband and I are newer to the Madison area, and we were hungry and near Sushi Muramoto, so we just walked right in. Great place, great food, and we'll go back!

If you're into uber-modern decor, this place is for you.

We split the crabcake appetizer and ate two rolls. Everything we ate was quite tasty and fresh. Our server was friendly and attentive. 

Next time we're near Hilldale Mall, which will be sooner than later, I know we'll revisit Sushi Muramoto."}
{"text":"Spendy, trendy, and crammed like sardines, but oh my gawd, tasty! If the food and drinks weren't so great, I'd give this a 3. If the floor plan was better, I'd give this a 5. My guy and I love sushi, but we also love a sense of tranquility while we enjoy our food. That is why we go to places like this, and not Golden Corral. Speaking of which, I need to get something off my chest:

Whoever is responsible for the interior architecture and interior design is very talented and I lovelovelove their \"vision\"...but they forgot something kind of major: there is just about zero personal space allowed at Muramoto during busy hours. So leave your coat in your car. And your scarf. And if you have social anxiety, well, most places do takeout, right? If you're moderately claustrophobic, visit Muramoto on a weekday as soon as they open, or around 3pm. I personally do not suffer from social anxiety or claustrophobia, but I do enjoy a little personal space when I'm eating an exquisite meal. I'm not exaggerating one bit when I say that you will likely be sitting closer to the stranger next to you than your date. Maybe you enjoy eavesdropping, and I'm not judging you if you're into that, but when I'm out with hubs to celebrate our anniversary, I really don't want to hear my booth buddy's pretentious conversation about the pitiful lack of lentil consumption in America. (Just a quick shout-out to Mr. Lentil, THEY GIVE YOU GAS, that's why they're not more popular in America!)

You know what makes an anniversary dinner really romantic? The non-stop action of having the waitstaff's rear in my face while they take Mr. Lentil's order because the tables are too damn close together. So much for wistful, dreamy glances at my amazing husband in the place he took me for our first date. (Seriously, buy me a drink before you wave that rump in my grill! it's okay. My husband's not the jealous type. And I'm not picky. Anything with vodka is fine with me.) I'm also not a fan of having a suitcase-sized \"handbag\" accented with chains being swung at my head as diners are seated six inches away from me. I know I have boundary issues, but holy crap. It's just uncomfortable, and to me, it defeats the whole point of going out to dinner at a nice place. You might have more elbow room eating at the bar. Of four out of the five visits we've made, it was exactly the same experience...delicious food in an overcrowded, awkward setting. One time we stopped in before the lunch rush, and were blessed with a 4-top table by the windows. I enjoyed that experience a lot, because it was calm and I was able to relax and really savor the meal. I even got to set my purse on an empty chair, rather than keep it in my lap while I ate! I wish it was always like that, but because it's always just hubs & I, we get put in the sardine section. I really love how gluttonous I feel when we order drinks, an appetizer, and then the food arrives, because there is literally NO MORE ROOM on our dinky table. I think my middle school lunch tray was bigger than these tables.

A couple other side notes:

Even though I'm a DINK, I don't hate kids. I'm quite fond of well-parented little tykes. I even like some of the crazier ones, too. But I'm trying to do you sushi-loving parents a favor here. Do not bring children under 8 to this place. It's not their scene. And don't get me started on the waiting period to get a table there. Oh well, I'm going there anyway. We were once told at 8pm that it would be a two-hour wait  to have dinner. The hours posted said that they closed at ten. I'll admit I only have a Bachelor's degree in ceramics (read: mud), but I can still do Kindergarten math. Clearly the hostess could not. To each their own.

You would think after this self-indulgent gripe session that I must be mistaken for giving Muramoto a 4-star rating. Floor plan aside, it's because the food and cocktails are THAT fan-friggin-tastic. The bartenders and sushi chefs are phenomenal. The waitstaff have great suggestions for fresh and new menu additions. I like to let the chefs pick my meal because they know their shit. Get the calamari though, because I believe it's the best in town. They must marinade it in buttermilk for 36 hours before they fry it or something. Either way, I rarely get the same thing twice at Muramoto, but the calamari is the exception. And the sauces that come with it...omfg. If I were on death row, that would be the last thing I ate. When your server asks if you saved room for dessert, don't wimp out. Even if you're stuffed (like a sardine, perhaps?), do yourself a favor and say \"Yes, I'd like the green tea crème brûlée\". It's not a gigantic portion. Just put it in your mouth and agree with me that it is a great reason for being alive.

To sum it up, if you love sushi and cocktails and wine, and you don't mind getting really close and personal really fast with total strangers, you are going to fall in love with this hip and trendy place. Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Service is great, and the shrimps and miso cod on lunch special menu are really nice. However, for their lunch special sushi combos, salmon is the only consistently fresh fish. Will stay away from their sushi options from now on."}
{"text":"great food and the presentation is excellent. the service was a little slower than I would have expected but will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Saturday night and wanted to give my wife and son a treat; sushi! So off we go to Sushi Muramoto. We get there around 6:30 and it is packed. Hostess said 45 minutes so I gave her my phone number and we walked around Hillsdale shopping center. Only 20 minutes later the phone rang and we were up. 

Place is dimly lit and attractively decorated. Perfect for a date imho. Onto the food: 

I ordered a matcha mule to drink. Everyone else had green tea. Wife had a salad, miso soup. I ordered the calamari appetizer for the table. She loved her salad but it didn't look all that special to me. (Very heavy on lettuce with corn flakes on top) Miso looked very good but I did not try it. The calamari was outstanding. Lightly breaded/fried and served with a flavored mayo soy sauce dip...just Devine. 

For rolls we had the large plate (chefs choice which turned out to be one of every type of fish) the dragon roll (shrimp and avocado based) and my fav the soft shell crab. (Really excellent as you can clearly taste/feel the perfectly cooked soft shell crab.) 

Based on the calamari and soft shell rolls alone...I'd go back. Everyone enjoyed themselves as I heard nothing but compliments. If I went on a less busy weekday maybe I give this place a 4.5 as I prefer smaller crowds."}
{"text":"If one must have one item from this place, it is the kobe tartar. The dish has the right flavor and the beef is so tender. Simply amazing. All the dishes, both the tapas and the sushi rolls are good. 

If only the place is easy to find and the waiters are friendlier I would have given this place a 5 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"Normally this place is excellent, but do not call in a to go order. I've tried three times now and I always end up waiting at least 20 minutes at pick up... Because they've forgotten my order and haven't started yet. This last time I waiting for 1 hour and 35 minutes from the time I called. They usually throw a gift card at me which is nice and keeps me coming back. They just don't fix the problem which is too bad, cuz the sushi is really great."}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto rightfully deserves 5 stars. This is the best sushi I have had in Wisconsin and  I would not think twice about going here over any other sushi location.

The sushi chefs really know what they are doing and keep the rolls tight (sushi is not good when it can't stay together in it's roll).

The Tarantula, Dragon, and Rainbow roll are some of my favorites, but the regular rolls, sashimi and nigiri are great too.

This is my dad's go to, he craves it. Literally every time he visits he request we go here, and trust me no one is fighting him on that one!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi place in Madison, try the sweet shrimp, deep fry the head, it's AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place in town. Relaxed atmosphere without a ton of frills and great food."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison hands down. Service is fast and friendly. Try some of the non-sushi appetizers too- they are great."}
{"text":"I came here last night for the first time and split the Small Plate and Maki Combo with my roommate. They gave us a spicy tuna roll, 2 rolls that were tuna and wasabi I think, an Ecuador roll, and assorted nigiri. I really like specialty rolls, and was impressed by the Ecuador roll, although my roommate didn't care for it too much. All of the rolls were very good, and the fish was flavorful and fresh. The restaurant was very classy and simple, and didn't seem like it should be in a mall! I was skeptical about a sushi restaurant in a mall, but Sushi Muramoto far exceeded my expectations. I will definitely come back (or go to the location near the Capitol, since that's closer to where I live)."}
{"text":"Seafood + Madison = bad call

Sushi + Madison = Sushi Muramoto

Only sushi place in town that gives you a true sushi experience in Madison.  Their Tuna plate guarantees you can always have fatty tuna a rarity in sushi places.

Great atmosphere and fresh fish are the only reason i venture to Hilldale"}
{"text":"We ordered take out for lunch yesterday, and it was pretty good.  A lot of the menu items seemed a bit steep, but my 3 roll chef's choice lunch was only $10.55?!  I thought that was a decent deal.  It came with an oshinko roll, a whitefish roll of some sort, and a spicy tuna.  The spicy tuna was spicier than most, which I appreciate.  The wasabi also seemed very good, and I am intrigues to go back and try the grated wasabi for an extra $5.  All in all, it was a decent meal for the price.  One thing I did not like was the packets of soy sauce.  For take out especially, I think it is much better to have a small container so that you can have something to dip into.  Aside from that, i was very happy with our meal.  I want to go back and dine in, because I hear that it is realyl nice inside."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best japanese restaurant in Madison. 
I love the lunch specials especially miso black cod and sushi set ($15). Always order these two entrees when I go there with my friend."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and truly enjoyed our meal. David, our sushi chef, was personable, knowledgeable and excited to recommend the freshest options. 

The sashimi sampler was fabulous-- blue fin, scallop, yellowtail and many more. The slices were thickly cut and as fresh as what I'm accustomed to in California on the beach. The specialty rolls were wonderful as well. 

The service was fabulous as well-- our server, Chauncey, was kind, attentive and made our experience even nicer. 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.
A bit pricey for dinner, but their lunch specials are excellent.

I had the beef hanger steak w/ rice and a salad. Only $9!
I was feeling in a spendthrift mood, so I also ordered the Sushi Combo 1, which is a chef's choice roll and 7 nigiri. 
Very delicious and honestly pretty filling for $15."}
{"text":"I was in the shopping center and decided to stop in to try out.  i sat at the sushi bar, and was very taken aback when the server asked me if I knew what i was ordering.  Yes, sir I know the difference between sushi and sashimi.  Fish was OK, but disappointed not hot cloth to was my hands and I had to ask for low sodium, bill was $30 for 9 pieces of sashimi a la carte."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best sushi I have had since moving back to the Midwest from Los Angles. The fish was fresh. The selections were bountiful. The chefs knew what they were doing and the service was excellent!  I will be back."}
{"text":"The squid nigiri (with shiso leaf) is my favorite sushi of all time* and on that alone I would give 5 stars. 

It's also the best sushi in Madison, so it's got that going for it. 

*I've eaten at Urasawa in LA, where every piece of fish was the best x I'd ever eaten...except the squid."}
{"text":"Decent but over-hyped sushi restaurant. Like many Madison Japanese restaurants, they don't prepare the rice traditionally; it tastes like Uncle Ben's put in the microwave. No rice vinegar, no salt or sugar. Just bland. It's too bad, because I'd argue that along with Takumi this place has by the far the freshest fish, and they do a nice job with portions. 

Their California roll advertises real crab, but it was a parsimonious serving and all we could taste was bland rice. The sushi assortment was good; their tuna is tender and has a nice deep color. Soft-shell crab rolls were decent, smoky crab flavor came through cleanly. I've also tried the 'black cod' dish at lunch and dinner. The cod is delicious----very fresh, buttery, delicate. But the plate itself needs a re-imagining, it's just a random hodgepodge of inedible raw onions, steamed cauliflower, and improperly prepared (and thus bitter) eggplant. A fish of that caliber and freshness really deserves a better concept and better execution than nasty vegetables.

Overall recommended if you're at Sundance for a movie and want some sushi, but Muramoto basically holds the line for Midwestern seafood averageness. Really not worth any kind of hype. That said, this is a good place for people watching; locals appear to show off their recent fashion purchases at Banana Republic and talk loudly about the whatever new P.T. Anderson movie they've seen."}
{"text":"Still 5/5, still best sushi place in town, many years and visits later. Service can be slow and getting a seat can be hard during peak times."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best sushi restaurant in Madison. 

I mostly order sushi, but I've tried some of their other dishes and those are delicious as well.

Their fish is flown in every day, which is a great rarity in the Midwest.

If I want sushi, Muramoto it is. There is not one sushi restaurant in Madison that even comes close the the freshness and quality that they offer."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the last reviewer, this is the best sushi in town.  This is one of a few sushi places my ex and I would frequent.  We came when we wanted to treat ourselves a bit.  Everything here is just better.  Better selection, better quality, better atmosphere, and better service, and all at a reasonable price.  If you've ever wanted to try Toro in the Madison area, this is the place to do it.  I would also recommend going with the fresh wasabi.  It will cost extra but is well worth it.   

I can't say enough about the atmosphere.  Hip, trendy, and yet very intimate.  A great place to take a date, especially with David Bacco's next door.  Just call me Hitch.

In response to one of the other reviews, I've always found the service here to be top notch.  In fact that was one of the things I remember most about first experience here."}
{"text":"Chef Morimoto is this legendary guy whose bright and colorful cookbooks would always catch my eye at the bookstore... and then I saw the man on Travel Channel talking about his style of food creation.

And then I saw Sushi Muramoto, and realized this cat has restaurants spotted all over the place  - and I hadn't tried any of them...  And then my bubble was burst once again as a very kind sir informed me that Muramoto is local to Madtown, and is NOT the famed Morimoto.  A local sushi guy huh??  I like how that sounds.   

I'm embarrassed by how much I still have to learn about a city I grew up in, but was never an adult in..... until now..... 

My is it fun getting reacquainted with Madison through it's restaurant and food culture. 

In walks I and my lovely friend (who always looks good no matter what day or time...and who has a tooth for sushi like you would not believe) and to our rescue is our waiter with seats opened immediately, and menus passed from his hands to ours.  

We ordered the Caterpillar, the Tarantula, and the tempura shrimp roll.  Nom Nom Nyummy!

I'm the first to admit I don't know anything about sushi, but it tastes good, it looks good on the plate,  and that's all that really matters at this point.

So I was ranting about this cult of hipster bullying, and small issues like the earth dying... 

Never mind...  More Sushi!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the go to place in Madison to get sushi, and since I'm enamored by sushi, Muramoto is an automatic high rating. Since I've only first tried it not too long ago, I only have a few comments, and here they are:

- The Godzilla (Gojira) roll is to die for. Loved that one. Possibly the best Madison sushi roll i've ever had! Also, my sushi plate had great presentation. It's rare for me to notice that sort of thing, but the whole plate just looked stunning. There was some good thought put into it i'm sure.

- Others have mentioned some problems with the service, and I can possibly see where they're coming from. Our Edamame appetizer took longer than one would expect to come out. But, the main course came out quickly, and everything else was up to snuff with what I expect at a good place. Our waiter was nice, but like some people have mentioned, he came off as kind of pretentious. As I was interested in trying out multiple rolls, I asked him which 3 rolls were in the chef's choice for tonight (Which I didn't find unreasonable to ask here in Madison WI, but in eastern countries this might be frowned upon), and he explained for all too long what \"Chef's choice\" meant and I didn't receive the names or ingredients of any of the rolls. I got the chef's choice regardless, but i'd rather not be assumed to be completely clueless about how to order anything.

- The sign thing (or lack of sign thing I guess?) people are referring is not a big deal at all. There's a sign on the door, and it's only going to be a potential issue the very first time you go. If you're going to complain about places with lack of signage, then check out the Natt Spil on King Street. It has no labeling at all, nor does it even have a phone to call, and guess what? That's a potential problem only on your first visit too! It's an easy thing to get over. It was a thought out decision by the owners in order to help establish their setting, and I applaud their decision.

I'm teetering between a 4 and 5 for Mr. Muramoto, but for now i'll go with a 4. The waiter thing I mentioned wasn't really a big deal, but i'd like to scope out the place a couple more times to make sure the quality of my experience is consistent, as others have mentioned some of their service experiences being poor."}
{"text":"We went at night. It's a little difficult to find if you don't know the area because they don't have neon signs of the restaurant's name.

Ambiance is excellent. The chicken wrap is awesome! I had to split it with my sister because it was massive. Food presentation is spot on. 

The green tea was hot and bitter; just the way I like it. I had the catepillar roll. It tasted fresh and cool.  Service was excellent. I shall return."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place..who would've thought in madison, wisconsin...fish was fresh(got the tuna nigiri plate which had the different types of tuna) and loved the pork belly."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something a little better than the usual Madison campus sushi scene, and was recommended to try Sushi Muramoto. They have a decently sized menu that includes rolls and entrees to suit most tastes. The place itself has a very \"clean\" feel and it's cool that they allow you to sit up close and watch the chefs prepare all of the food at the sushi bar. 

The food itself was tasty and surprisingly around the same price as some of the more hole in the wall joints on University. With appetizer, multiple rolls (~5), drinks and tip it was $30 for my boyfriend and I.

What surprised me the most, however, was the staff. Our waiter, Nick, provided some of the best service we've had around Madison. The timing of the order, food and bill was impeccable, and he never interrupted our conversation. The best waiter is usually the one where I find that I always have a full glass, but don't recall the waiter ever pouring it. Very unobtrusive. When he made an honest mistake with our bill, we were able to flag him down immediately. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and all in all a great experience. Although it is pricey it's worth it. I wish it were less pricey, with the same quality, as I would dine there at least once a week... if not more. 
The seaweed salad is to die for! The steak is also so tender and delicious. I want some right now!"}
{"text":"I know our sushi options are not plentiful and this is definitely the best of the bunch.  That would explain why this restaurant is always crowded!  I love the Ecuador roll and all things nigiri.  This place does the job and hits the fresh sushi spot.  Thankfully!!"}
{"text":"We could tell the fish was old, had a very fishy taste and was not good. The amount of rice on each piece was extremely minimal, the fish was the smallest we've ever received, and the rice was clearly poor quality as it didn't even stick to the fish. That being said, it was the Monday of Memorial Day weekend so maybe that's why the fish wasn't fresh? Either way, not acceptable for how small the pieces were. Also, we wanted to add 3 different fish to our order that were on the menu, but they were out of all 3. Disappointing."}
{"text":"It definitely has the same atmospheric feel and identifying flavor as its sister restaurant, Morris Ramen. The menu is straight forward and consise and the prices are really great for the quality.

Because I am indecisive and open-minded, I opted for the chef's special which includes 3 rolls (chef's choice) for $20!! You really can't beat that price. 

I got: 
escolar roll (very fresh and exactly as described)

Godzilla roll (unlike any godzilla roll I have had before. They are usually pretty standard and all taste the same, but this one was unique in that it was not deep fried, was not simply covered in Sriracha and the caviar that was added as garnish was delicious!)

Spicy shrimp inside out roll: (very flavorful albeit \"Madison spicy\" which means it is not nearly as spicy as the description would imply. This was my husband's favorite.)

Coconut tofu:  not what I expected from the description. It was mostly onions with some really squishy tofu, not typically what comes to mind when you read \"fried tofu\" in the description. The flavor was really good and it was a generous portion, just not what I expected. 

The service was good once we were finally acknowledged after sitting at the sushi bar for 15 minutes. 

Overall, the sushi is delicious, very well priced and I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in town. Great attention to detail and excellent service. Fatty tuna was amazing."}
{"text":"The decor is extremely trendy, I thought I was going to cool, hip lunch spot for some awesome sushi.
Turns out, the food was pretty bad. I looked around at what other people were eating (yes, I'm nosey) and those who were eating rice, looked like they were eating some Chinese stir fried chicken and a heap of white rice. 
So I decided to go with the lunch special- sushi : 7 pcs nigiri and one roll. I asked what the fish was, because it was the chef's choice, the waitress had no idea. Since I eat most kinda of fish, I decided to risk it and see what happened.
Well, the chef's choice is by no means omakase, it means the bad fish that they want to throw away. I was given mackarel I think? And some other horrible tasting fish. Some of the white fish- no idea what it was once again, tasted so bad I had to spit it out. Some parts of the fish had weird hard bits in it and I spit those out too.
I'd rather eat pizza than eat this crap, certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating.  Was here a few months ago for dinner on a Saturday night.  Had one of the best sushi meals of my life.

I went with the chef's choice special.  I was concerned about letting the chef choose, but I put fate in someone else's hands.

Luckily I was nothing but happy with what the chef decided.  I ended up getting a Godzilla roll, a spicy tuna, and a salmon roll.  The quality tasted good, and everything came at a nice pace.

Our service was top notch.  Noticing there were 3 couples, our waitress immediately asked us if we wanted separate checks.  The restaurant had a nice interior and ambiance.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Not good.  Chefs not wearing hairnets nor gloves.  Rice overdone, ginger in sushi rolls?   Wtf?  Would not go back again!"}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto has been my go-to stop for sushi in Madison for a couple of years now. Service is a huge part of the experience to me, and the waitstaff is always super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items and different kinds of fish available. I've been there multiple times when it's packed, but I've never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a table. The last time I went with a large group (with 2 add-ons to our reservation) and we were accommodated immediately with no problem. As for the menu itself, there is no shortage of diversity and there is a dish for everybody (even if you aren't crazy about seafood and fish); dishes are also priced really fairly for their excellent quality and size. The only downside to Sushi Muramoto, I would say, is the dining area: it is a little cramped, and when it's busy and full, it's almost impossible to avoid eavesdropping on your neighbors. Great place regardless."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and it was not impressive.  The ginger were browned and I did not finish my lunch because it became unappetizing after several bites.  Do not recommend.  35 dollars for lunch is really steep."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sushi.  Just thinking about their yellowtail roll makes my mouth water because the fish was so delicious.  Spicy tuna and Boston rolls are also pretty good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Madison. I am picky about sushi I'm from Los Angeles. This place is pretty consistent especially for Madison (somewhere not on a coast) anyways my favorite things here are the specialty rolls. Godzilla, fire and Ecuador are my top three. Also I always get the vegetable tempura that is always perfect and the spicy mayo it comes with is addicting. One of the few places you can get albacore tuna !! unlike a lot of places that say it's albacore but it's not!! Another good choice is the maki combo you get a good amount of sushi for the price. I enjoy the wine here as well and the service is usually pretty good!"}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend and his parents a few months ago--I definitely wouldn't want to go too often on my own dime.  The food is good, but I have to say that I found some of the specialty rolls a little overly busy--I know that's sort of standard for special rolls, but sometimes I just want something that does a simpler flavor very well.

The plum wine we had was excellent, though, and it's a nice atmosphere for a special occasion.  We also all shared a dessert, I forget exactly what, but it had fresh berries in it and was a very nice end to the meal."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in Madison. The soft shell crab roll is yummy, and their nigiri options are great! I definitely recommend the lunch menu, too, since you can get an order of the super tasty hanger steak appetizer as a meal for a great price. My husband loves ordering their Bury the Hatchet cocktail, and I love the simplicity of the Soho Sunset. Even their takeout is great. Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu here, although it's worth noting that the chicken lettuce wrap app is a messy (albeit yummy) undertaking."}
{"text":"WOW. I have been completely blown away. Came here with some friends while in Madison on business and was schooled in new fusion sushi. 

The place was very busy, and we had to wait a little bit to get our orders, but it wasn't that bad, and the staff were obviously pushing hard to make sure everyone was taken care of.

The food more than made up for it. its nice to see a sushi bar that actually stocks proper traditional sushi fare. Quail egg was magnificent and fresh with creamy yolks. The roe selection was a good third of my meal ,and the freshly grated wasabi was the perfect topper. as the menu says, its sweeter and WAY more complex.

It's a bit loud when busy, not the place for a romantic dinner during peak times, but still a blast and allot of fun if you are there to socialize. No need for shouting when at a table for 8 :D

I will be in Madison again, and I will be going back to Sushi Muramoto."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. We went at an off time, so it was kind of empty and the hostess was doing everything; seating us, taking orders, bartending & busing tables without missing a step. The lychee martini is delicious, so are any of the chu hi drinks. The pork belly appetizer was a combination of unexpected & delightful favors & textures, and the sushi was delicious and fresh. The specialty rolls (fire and rainbow) were wonderful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I agree with those who say this place is overrated and overhyped.  Good, not great, sushi and the prices are high.  The upside is the selection of high end tuna, the downside is they are often out of one or more types.  A good place to be seen around Madison.

I have recently been stopping here for lunch and have to compliment them on their quick service and reasonable ($15 for 7 nigiri and a tuna or other basic roll) lunch specials.  They always have a good selection of fish as the chef's choice, not just the typical tuna and salmon combo.  I am giving them an extra star because they really shine at lunchtime.  The service is great too."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite sushi place in Madison! BY FAR! Here, you'll find the rice to be perfectly chewy, the right amount of filling, and complimentary tea!

The lunch sushi special is the best deal in town. I get this almost every time I go here: sushi combo #2. You get 3 rolls for only $10. Only catch is that you don't get to pick which rolls. So if you love sushi no matter what, this is the place to nom away!

Their cod and crab cakes are also superb. If you want to add an appetizer, their shrimp and vegetable tempura is also very decent.  For a lighter appetizer,  the seaweed salad is very savory! Lastly there calamari is also extremely well-made and the sauce to dip it in is a mixture of spicy mayo and vinegar, which I find very unique to this restaurant.

It can get a bit cold if you sit down at this restaurant, so be sure you dress in layers of you come here! 

This is one of my favorite restaurants so I highly recommend coming here!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for sushi. They have a wide selection of sushi that include some of the nicer choices - uni, toro, tobiko - and their menu is better than at their other location downtown. And everything's very fresh, always. Furthermore, they have a very wide selection of sake that you can pair with whatever selection of sushi you end up choosing. I always choose nigiri a la carte, seeing as one of the advantages of this place is that they actually know what they're doing and there's no need to settle for a preset combo.

Piece of advice - they get fresh shipments of fish in every day except Sundays, so your selection of some of the more popular choices of fish may not be available by Sunday dinner. Aim to go on another evening."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars

I'll start with the positives.  

1. Muramoto has large cuts of decent quality fish.  

2. They have a large saki list

3.  The space itself is trendy.  

Now the negatives. 

1. The service is terrible.  I've been there numerous times and I always leave vowing to never return because the service is so bad.  I won't get into specific examples so you'll just have to trust me.  When you're spending a fairly sizable amount of money on sushi and saki you should get good service.  Some servers are better than others but overall there is a feeling of ineptitude.   

2.  They're always out of the more interesting cuts of fish. 

3.  Its in a mall. 

4.  No saki flights like the one downtown.  Why?

5.  A bit pricey.  $16 for a roll?  Ok in some places but Muramoto's are not big enough to be $16.  

6.  Tables are a bit crowded but this is more of a minor concern compared to the rest of the shortcomings.  

Overall the lack of an alternative 'fancy' sushi place in Madison keeps me going to Sushi Muramoto.  Unfortunately I feel like the negatives are beginning to outweigh the positives as the restaurant matures (it should be the opposite).  If Takara was not in a strip mall next to a dollar-store it'd be my go-to.  But for now Muramoto is - somewhat disappointingly - 'it'.

PS I agree with the other reviewer's take on the edamame - mushy and not edible."}
{"text":"After having experienced Sushi Muramoto catering some of my old company's events, My wife and I figured we'd give it a shot.

First off, the pros.  The food is above average and there are definitely some stand out signature items.  The braised pork belly is outrageously good and they have several specialty rolls that would definitely join my top tier list.

The cons are the service.  I'm hoping that my experience was a one time negative, but our dinner took 2 hours!  We're pretty certain our waitress forgot to enter our order but we're not sure because we'd get periodic items every 15-20 minutes.  It was one of the most frustrating meals I've experienced and they most likely won't get the chance to make up for it."}
{"text":"A recommendation from a friend and a trip to Hilldale got us here for a late lunch.

Ambiance :  Modern yet simplistic and quite functional. The bathrooms were clean so thank you (It's not that common you know!). The seating is a mixed bag. Skip the TINY tables in the middle unless you're all by yourself, else you'll end up navigating the water glasses from left to right as your dishes come!

Service : Laid back but not tardy

Food : We ordered a portion of Crab Croquettes, Calamari and finally a Sushi roll from their Specials - Dragon.

The Crab rolls were fresh and quite light to eat thanks to their rather thin batter. The flavor itself was very mild so pairing it with the sweet and sticky tonkatsu sauce and the salty almost mayonnaise like aioli was quite refreshing.

The calamari was cooked Beautifully and had the lightest batter you can imagine. The seasoning was spot on as well. I wasn't a fan of the ponzu mayonnaise as neither wanted to mix with each other despite being served together in the same bowl.

The sushi roll was OK. The rice didn't feel as fresh as you'd expect from a Sushi restaurant and the flavor profile was too bland. I couldn't trace the masago mayo unfortunately and eel to avocado ratio was off so you couldn't truly appreciate the eel.

As a final note, this place has some decent food but I'd probably avoid Sushi here."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Madison and affordable! It has the largest selection of fish that you can find at any sushi place around here. I would highly recommend their specialty roles."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The sushi combo deals are really worth it and you get a lot of sushi for your money. The fish used for the nigiri is of great quality.

I've also gotten their lunch specials before and I really liked their chicken teriyaki. The rice is delicious! I'm used to jasmine rice but the rice they give is the chunky type that tastes really good. I really like the dressing they use for their salad.

One negative is that during the summer, the restaurant sometimes has fruit fly problems. It doesn't bother me too much but my friends seemed to be really disgusted."}
{"text":"I am surprised at how many positive reviews this place has received.  I was so excited to try this place because others had talked up how good it was. I live in Phoenix and the selection of sushi restaurants there is phenomenal!  I went here for lunch with my sister and ordered a lunch special.  I tried to force it down, but was unable to.  Maybe they were having an off day or the sushi was old...either way I will not be back to find out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 25 times over the past 5 years or so.  Probably more.  Most of the time it's for lunch but I've carried out and eaten dinner there numerous times as well.  It's not my favorite sushi in Madison, but it's really solid.  The service has always been good and the food is great.  I'd like to see a few more veggie Maki options, but the ones they have, while standard, are well executed."}
{"text":"This hip sushi bar and restaurant is well worth the price. This is my go to place for every occasion, especially on busy night you just order take out. A combination of rolls and sashimis is always good. The miso soup is great and the algea salad has to be tried"}
{"text":"Not bad.  The dining room was cozy but not too crowed or noisy. The vibe here is more of a modern/fusion japanese restaurant  rather than a traditional sushi bar.
I ordered mainly nigiri (Toro, Hamachi, Sake, Ikura, and a spicy tuna roll to wash it all down)
Overall, the sushi was average in terms of freshness, flavor, cuts, and taste.  
appetizers are around 10-18
sushi runs around 5 - 18 for 2 pieces
rolls are all around 8-10 for starts.
Not sure if I would make a huge effort to return but if you're in the area and craving sushi this might hit the spot.  I don't get the 4-5 star ratings.  Perhaps this is as good as it gets for sushi in the Madison area."}
{"text":"So I have eaten Sushi at different cities in the US, and NOTHING comes close to this place.  The food is AMAZINGGGGGG.  The people who work there are so cool, so friendly, so classy, so sophisticated.  It feels like you're in New York or Paris.  

Now let me tell you about the amazing food.  The Beef Hanger Steak is so freakin good, I don't know what they put in that sauce, but it's ridiculously delicious. 

Now the Miso soup is the BEST I have ever had, and the SEAFOOD SALAD, omg the sauce is Killer good...

WOW, this place is so Fabulous, and Delicious.

This restaurant should be a model for other restaurants."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this sushi place. It was recommended to me by a stranger when asking if literally anyone knew where I could get good sushi.. not that average hibachi steakhouse California roll type sushi.. and Sushi Muramoto is where I ended up. I love trying new things so I was excited that there was a chefs plate option.. where you get a certain number of items based on the chefs choice that day. That is absolutely what I ordered, along with some sake that was recommended by my waitress.

Service was prompt. Sushi was fresh and well prepared. The tables are packed tightly together, which is fine, but you're going to be hearing what your neighbors are saying very clearly."}
{"text":"The tarantula roll is a must-try if you like soft-shell crab and the anago offers a nice twist to the ubiquitous unagi,  The rolls themselves are a bit lackuing in creativity but the quality of the fish is excellent and the presentation great.  Plus the braused pork belly app is one of the best sushi starters I have had in Madison.  This is the best sushi restaurant in town, I would dare venture."}
{"text":"Some people recommended Muramoto for sushi so I took my friend here on a snowy Monday around 7:30pm -- it wasn't busy since it was so cold out, so we didn't have to wait.  The staff is extremely friendly & chill; the decor is very clean & trendy with dim lighting, great for a romantic dinner (FYI) or even just a nice outing with friends.

We got seats at the sushi bar immediately and I loved the menu's layout -- it consisted of small pages of paper on a tiny clipboard; super creative & stylish.

I'm trying to avoid rice but wasn't in the mood for sashimi & asked if I could have a Fire Roll without rice (RED usually does this for customers). This threw off the waiter, but the chef was really nice about it & said he'd try. He made me a hand roll instead; it wasn't exactly what I was looking for but I appreciate the effort. I wasn't sure how to go about eating it, so I just assumed to go straight at it with my hands. It was pretty yummy but nothing super phenomenal.  

I hope to visit again soon & try out more dishes."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Madison. For a Midwest place, this place has it all.

In the 1+year I lived in Madtown, I was at this sushi joint more than any other restaurant.

I always asked my server what was fresh that day, and it never disappointed my appetite for delicious raw fishies.

I love this place and miss it terribly."}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch date.  The sushi was delicious!  The server was attentive but not clingy and the restaurant has a nice feel to it!  Just a great place to go for some good sushi."}
{"text":"I am reviewing about the lunch: it was really good! and its also 9 dollars, which makes it really affordable! each entree comes with a salad and rice. the salad was very good, with cornflakes instead of croutons. I had the crab cakes, which did not compare to maryland crab cakes but it was still pretty good.but it was still pretty nice. The fish lunch special was not too great however."}
{"text":"Solid sushi. Fresh. Good cocktail menu. Girlfriend loves the Miso Cod. Typical sushi pricing for specialty rolls."}
{"text":"The food and sushi is very good, but there is no point sitting at the Sushi Bar as they act like you're not even there. 
The Sushi Chef's will talk to each other, but that's it. They are also very slow when it comes to taking care of orders. 
I'm from Las Vegas and know what it's like to have good Sushi Restaurants on every corner. Not here. I have been to many Amazing Sushi restaurants and this place would be so much better if the kitchen was as friendly as the service staff. 
How can I sit at the Sushi Bar and the Chef does not take my order or even give me my sushi when it's ready. The server had to come get it and then walk 3 
This place would not last one day in a City with real customer service. 

Will I come back here again? But I will not sit at the sushi bar. 
I expect some kind of interaction from the chef. He should be taking my order and serving me. Or Don't have a tip jar out if you're not going to work for it.

The sushi was really good though."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi was fabulous. We waited over an hour for our food with no explanation. Our food that was ordered individually came all together. Our server was non communicative. We actually had two servers, one in training, but It was confusing which one was the trainer, when we received our food I asked for them to check the ticket time and upon noticing it had been an hour, she said there was a 7 top before us. Several tables were sat and served before us. And that was it, no apology, no playful attitude, no compensative offering. I'd go back for take out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend loves coming here, the food is great, the lunch prices are good, you get all the green tea you can drink....but I absolutely hate it. 
I loathe coming here. 
If it's busy they make you wait at the awkward bar that I have never seen being used as an actual bar. It's just a big thing taking up space. The divider between the 'bar' and dining area is way too close to the bar stools so you spend your wait time staring at an un-tended bar while trying to squeeze as close to it as you can to let others by when their table is ready. 
The plates slap and clang around. The chairs Scraaaaaaaape across the floor. The tables are so close people at the next table sometimes feel the need to say hello, or they just stop talking and make awkward eye contact when you sit down. You hear every last word spoken at the table to your left or right.  In the winter it always feels a little wet in here. In the summer it always feels a little wet in here. 
The house music is CD based and not on repeat so sometimes it just stops, ripping away the one slight acoustic buffer.

I could have been in a warm booth comfortably spaced from other diners, beer in hand burger on the way but Nooooo 'let's go get sushi!'

Ditch that bar for more table space. Or ditch the individual tables for bigger communal tables (your only 2 inches away from that as it is).  Dehumidifiers exist, buy one and run it constantly. Little felt pads for the chair feet exist, buy some so the chairs can be moved without making a horrendous metal on cement scraping sound. The repeat button on your CD player exists, find it. Decorative acoustic panels exist, buy some and put them on the wall.  Don't change the food though, it's pretty good; which is why we will inevitably be back. 

Here's a free restaurant idea for somebody: sushi AND a comfortable environment! Madison had it once and it was called Ton-Ton. Rest in peace Ton-Ton I think of you often"}
{"text":"Top Highlights/Lowlights

1) no reservations for tables under 6 people
2) long wait
3) great food!

First things first, if you are looking for awesome sushi in the Madison area Sushi and Restaurant Muramoto are top notch. The fish is super fresh and everything from the basic sushi, to the entrees to the apps is awesome! 

The downtown location (Restaurant Muramoto) has a lot more non-sushi menu options in addition to sushi so if you are with a non sushi lover I would head downtown but if you love sushi and don't want to deal with downtown traffic or pay to park the Hilldale location is just right for you! 

I came with a group of four on a Friday night and our plan was to eat and then catch a 9:35 movie at Sundance Cinemas which is conveniently located across the street. We arrived at 7:30 thinking about 2 hours would cover us even if there was a wait. There was definitely a wait! We were told it would be about an hour so we went over to the bar section of the restaurant and got a cocktail table right away. There was a surprising amount of speciality cocktails to choose from in addition to beer and wine. A cool cocktail to try is the Chu Hai! Basically you pick from the different types of Chu Hai (I think it's like vodka) and then they add sparking water and a flavoring or your choice. I tried the sugarcane and sweet potato Chu Hai with grapefruit and then pineapple flavoring. The drinks were awesome and a little cheaper than the other cocktails. We had plenty of time for cocktails as the wait ended up being closer to an hour and 20 minutes! The staff was very friendly about updating us on the wait which was sweet and our server moved our meal along quickly since we were in a rush to get to our movie! 

The wait was worth it as the sushi was awesome! Ask your server about how to make the rolls gluten free! I found out afterwards that they can even do some of tempura rolls gluten free! Great place for great sushi if you don't mind waiting!"}
{"text":"Seriously, no toro?  Home for ten days on leave and there's no fatty tuna, here or anywhere else I visited?  Someone hates me...

Over my leave, I ate sushi twice, first weekend in NYC, and then again for my last weekend here in Wisconsin.  Checking through the yelp, this was to be my last taste of sushi until I come home in the fall.

We drank.  And ate.  A lot.  At one point, our server laughed at all the clear liquid filled glasses on our table.  Between the shochu, namazake and water (had to clear our palettes with something), it was a pretty full table.

We started with the steamed mussels, which were awesome.  Not a single bad one in the bowl, and our server brought spoons for the broth (coconut and lemongrass with sausage and thai basil).  The only way it could've improved would have been bread to soak it all up with, but, alas, sushi places don't keep baguettes.

That was followed by our giant platter.  We had six pair of different nigiri favorites, except for toro and yellowtail (both out), including the uni (very fresh) and the wasabi tobikko.  The tobikko was insanely hot.  Watching my girl alternate between pain and relief with every chew was hilarious...until I ate mine.  When you bite down, the wasabi pounds through your sinuses, and then breathing and opening your jaw clears it.  Repeat a couple times and you'll see.  Still worth the taste.

With that, we also had three rolls.  I know, I know, I'm the only one who can get fat on sushi.  We had the Rainbow, Godzilla and Tarantula.  All three were pretty huge, had their own distinguishable flavors and sauces, and tasted amazing.  Of note, despite containing cream cheese, the Godzilla wasn't packed with it.  I highly appreciate that.

I loved coming here, toro aside.  I've not been to the two sister restaurants, but, by the service and quality I experienced here, I've got a solid expectation of what I'll find there.  I was tempted to go four stars for depriving me of my seven month (now one year) dreams of toro, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on my return to the states."}
{"text":"Oh yes please! I was here a few days ago with some friends. I always love this place...best sushi in Madison. I'll admit I've only ever gotten rolls, but when I look at what other tables are ordering, all of their entrees and um, yep, everything looks sooo good. Our group ranged from sushi expert to novice level - and everyone was in sushi heaven!! I more often get a big delicious tray to go for of a bunch a rolls for a group of people. So this time I went with a couple of favorites..hotategai and spicy shrimp. Also I highly recommend the miso soup and edamame. It was a cold day, so we went with hot edamame (and the miso soup). Fantastic food, great service, wish I could eat here every day! They're often busy, so you might want to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been here two or three times, and have been somewhat underwhelmed. 

Pros:
-A nice, clean space with plenty of room between the tables
-Decent services and wait times 
-Reasonable prices

Cons:
- Inconsistent sushi rice. On our last visit it was definitely overlooked. I've had worse, but I've definite had better.
- Somewhat sloppy construction of sushi rolls. They stayed together, but pieces weren't consistent in size. The end pieces were much narrower than the middle. 
-Avocado was bordering on being over ripe.

In general, it looks like a nicer place than it is."}
{"text":"What they do - is great. But - I have only 4 stars because they don't have anything new. Actually - I don't recall any new item / dish in this restaurant for more than two years. 
It's about time to refresh your menu"}
{"text":"It bums me out to be writing a slightly negative review of Muramoto as it's been the go to for sushi for the past 7 years.  Prior to the last six months, I would have given them 5 stars - consistent quality, fresh offerings, incredible prices - but our last 3 or 4 visits have been mildly disappointing. I should specify that my husband and I have ordered practically the same rolls dozens of time over the years and they're all regular rolls, not specialty rolls.  So maybe they're putting all the talented rollers on the fancy rolls, but the rolls we've been receiving have all looked sloppy (falling apart) and contain teeny, tiny pieces of fish/veggies when they used to be little works of art packed full of goodness.  The service is still incredible and quick and I love that they're expanding their cocktail menu, but I go out for sushi for the fish, not for the rice."}
{"text":"The place needs to be closed for 3 days and the whole thing pressure washed. There's duct tape on some of the cabinets. It's falling apart. Menus are sticky and stained and I must have annoyed the waitress by showing up."}
{"text":"Restaurant Muramoto is one of the dining establishments in Madison that was created with a successful vision, presentation and most importantly, the menu.  On this visit, I started with the miso.  A well balanced soup with a decent mix of scallions and tofu.  At $3, a nice diversion which unfortunately was marred by a merely warm rather than hot temperature.
Alongside the miso was a seaweed salad which may be the best salad in Madison.
Rounding out the savory portion of the meal was a roll comprised of yellowtail and scallion.  Though well crafted, nothing about it could be considered a greater result than a similar effort of the restaurant's closest competitors.  All the same, they were good enough to fit in contextually with the first two dishes consumed.  The standout of the meal was a dessert which may stand alone as one of the best I have experienced anywhere.  
A generous cake slice which included a chocolate granache frosting which sat atop a mixture of yellow cake and coconut, with a tangelo marmalade filling.  My dining companion was willing to share a little scoop of their ginger and honey infused ice cream.  A well aspected combination."}
{"text":"This was an impromptu Mother's Day lunch and it was so stinking good! By far the best sushi we've had in Madison. We started with the calamari and the non-gf folks said it was the best they've ever had, the beef appetizer was also super yummy. Most of us split multiple chef's choice sushi platters. I was sad when one included a California Roll, but the kiddos slurped it up with joy. My husband had the salmon with mussels and the children had to fight for the dregs. Wine list was also decent. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm from the west coast and picky about this particular food. Nothing in the Midwest will ever compare to coast sushi but SM gets me through. It's pricey but not unreasonable and their wine list is small but delicious. Best sushi place in Madison by far, especially when the \"A\" team is working (which is most weekend nights)"}
{"text":"I live for Muramoto Roll. Shiso + squid, wrapped in a thin egg sheet. . It's is awesom!"}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto is the place to go for Sushi In Madison.  The quality of the food is outstanding.  If you like Tuna they offer a Huge Variety of different types of Tuna that you can buy as nigiri or sashimi.  My Favorite by far is the Fatty Tuna.  The Fire Roll is my absolute favorite roll.  Try the shrimp Tempura as an appetizer its absolutely fantastic.  I have never had a bad meal here.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good, nicer (but not too expensive) sushi place. It's a great place for date night or a group of 4-5. I went with a group of four and everyone ordered different rolls. The chefs special has a great array, although I would recommend specifying if there are any types of fish you don't like. There are choices for simple rolls (like salmon, tuna and cucumber) or specialty rolls that are specific to the restaurant. Would recommend both. Reasonably priced for a sushi place as well. Also highly recommend the honey sake! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"good environment. nice plating. I want just wondering if the kobe beef is really from Japan or just \"Kobe-style\" beef made in USA...cuz the kobe beef sashimi tasted a little bold."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best sushi spot in the Madison area. There may be a couple of other places that come close or equal, but not better.  They serve a great product and have a nice selection on the menu. Service is generally very good.  If you have someone in your party that isn't into seafood, their steak dish is very good."}
{"text":"To be honest, I would give this place more of a 3.5 for food quality, but I'll round up to 4 since we had great service and the decor is pretty cool. Plus, convenient location with ample parking in the Hilldale area! 

The sushi was good...for Madison standards. I don't think thats saying much though, unfortunately. Muramoto's main competitor (Red on Washington) blows it out of the water. 

I still enjoyed my dinner at Muramoto, but certainly felt a lack of 'wow that was amazing' dishes and more of a 'that was okay' feeling when I left. Good place for an intimate dinner or with a group (we got a cool semi-private room for a party of 10). I really like the ambience of the restaurant but felt like the food didn't do the reviews justice."}
{"text":"I came here for after-dinner drink. Hey, if you're city girl (or guy) like me, you'll like the chic decor. it totally reminded me of the city life I used to have, and something I can't get on State Street. The bartender is really cool, too. My asian saketini was strong (and this is pseudo-alcoholic speaking). Extensive sake list, and Choya- plum wine ...  gets me so nostalgic about my mom's home made plum wine."}
{"text":"Ok,  this was probably the best sushi that I have eatin in a long time.  I have had good even some I may call great but this was amazing. This place is a must come to if you are in this area. The service is fantastic with a clean wholesome atmosphere. Oh if you need a good drink ask for a sake bomb need I say more on how amazing this place is. If I ever return I will come back. By the way they do not offer military discounts but who cares when the place is so nice."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar on a bustling Tuesday night when I was in town for a work visit last week.  It was pretty busy with only a few seats available at either the bar or sushi bar.  I was sandwiched between a quiet couple and a pair of loud college girls who were flirting with one of the sushi chefs.  

The waitress greeted me after I was seated and gave me some time to look over the menu.  After placing my order, she checked in one other time to see if I was okay and let me know my food was coming shortly.  I ordered the Tuna Sampler, which was 5 pieces: one each of toro, bluefin, bigeye, yellowtail, and albacore nigiri.  Maybe it was because I was by myself and time seemed to go by slower, but it took a long time to receive my food, about 40 minutes.  It seemed like I wasn't the only one since I overheard the waitress ask for status for another table who was waiting for their food.  There were so many rolls being made in front of me, lined up to be cut and plated so they were definitely busy.  The fish itself was good, not too thickly cut.  It's a good sign that the place was packed, but they can definitely work on improving efficiency."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service is terrible! I've been there twice, and both times we've had strange interactions with our waitress (different people each time).  The most recent time our waitress was bending over my husband and I to get plates off the table - except she was leaning on us too heavily.  I'm 9 months pregnant and got up because she was pushing my belly into the table - and my husband got a smudge of her deoderant on his cheek!!!!!!  Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"A lot of hype for OK sushi. Not the best that Madison has to offer. Do your research before you try this place out. I guess it is all about the location for this one."}
{"text":"I went back and forth between 3 stars and 4 stars here but ultimately decided on four because of our server and the rolls we ordered. Muramoto is a solid sushi restaurant but they lack certain qualities that would make them 4 to 5 stars consistently. They lack creativity with their rolls-what they do, they do well but they aren't pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box. They also lack a decent bar program. Their cocktails are subpar, wine list is adequate, etc. Their waitstaff seems to be hit and miss most times but we got lucky this time. We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed watching the chefs make rolls in front of us-the only problem being is you can hear the chefs. Mind you-I used to work in the food and beverage industry so nothing a chef could say would surprise me. However, with an open kitchen concept, the chefs should be a bit more professional and perhaps a bit more put together. Nonetheless, service was quick, rolls were delicious, and the wine pours were heavy. All of these added up to 4 stars this time. This place goes in waves and I hope one day they stay right where I rated them if not higher."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that Sushi Muramoto is overrated and overhyped. I'd much prefer the other sushi places around Madison. I'd also much prefer Restaurant Muramoto over its sister restaurant for its location (downtown!!) and all-you-can-eat option. If I can get the same grade sushi for a cheaper price, why not?

I have to say though, the tuna poke is superb. Definitely a must-have if you are there!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Muramoto. Great service and it's difficult to not overdo it on ordering endless rolls."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a dish I don't like at this place.  The staff is friendly and the few times we've had to wait for a table, it's been well worth it.  This has become our go-to place. Definitely call ahead for a table. Ordering take out is awesome.  They told me 60 min and called sooner to advise my sushi was ready. Friendly and well worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Best place in Madison to get the combination of great sushi, delicious hot dishes, incredible cocktails, and tasty dessert! As opposed to other sushi restaurants like Red (which has the best sushi/sashimi in my opinion), Muramoto does a wonderful delivering in all different areas which is definitely a plus for me. Some favorites and tips that I have:

- The front of this restaurant is definitely kind of hidden. The sign is located above eye level and you just have to identify the huge door - otherwise the rest of it can be easily lost.

- Weekends are definitely packed so stop by and put in your name, then go and shop Hilldale while you wait for your table! Or avoid all together and go on a weekday with no wait.

- Chef's Combo is an awesome deal: 1 specialty roll + 2 regular rolls for $20! Just discovered this the last time I came here and I can't believe I've missed it all this time. Considering a specialty roll usually runs around $16, this is such a steal.

- If you're feeling adventurous, the Ama Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) is mind-blowing. I can't even fathom how the shrimp tastes naturally so sweet, and you can get the heads deep fried and served separately. Sounds a little intimidating but one of my favorite things they serve!

- Black Cod with Miso will change your perception on fish. They somehow cook it so the fish quite literally melts in your mouth and the sauce is so savory and delightful.

- Just tried the Seared Mackerel with Yuzo Miso during Sustainable Seafood Week and it was surprisingly awesome. It's served with a thick miso sauce, various beets and root vegetables, and the mackerel is sitting on top. Really interesting and tasty combo!

- Be aware of extra charge with side sauces such as eel sauce or spicy mayo (extra 50 cents to $1.00 added on.)

- TRY THEIR COCKTAILS. Just had one made of lychee liquor and grapefruit juice. Still thinking about how amazing it was right now.

- One thing they serve but don't necessarily put on their menu is a different creme brûlée every day. Ask about it and they'll let you know the flavor of the day! 

Muramoto gets it right in just about every aspect of their restaurant. Be sure to explore their menu and give this place a visit!"}
{"text":"I like this place. When giving ratings to sushi restaurants in Madison, it's always hard to know if I should base it on a Madison scale or a national scale. In other words, if Sushi Muramoto delivered the same quality sushi in california, they'd probably only get three stars. But being that we're in the midwest, they deserve their four stars. I'd have to say that Sushi Muramoto is one of only two sushi places in town that serves decent quality fish.

My only complaints about the food are: 1. the red sauce they put on the bottom of some rolls is WAY too overwhelmingly spicy. It takes away from the taste of the roll. 2. you could tell that they used the shittier hamachi for the negihama roll compared to just the yellowtail sushi. I love love love yellowtail so I'll usually get two pieces of sushi as well as a yellowtail+scallion roll. There was a noticeable difference in the quality of fish they used for each :( Also, 3. I ordered coke and got pepsi. I know it's not THAT big of a deal but it's a big pet peeve of mine, so I thought I'd mention it anyway. Read my tagline. I hate pepsi.

But this place gets gold stars for not being overpriced. I feel like some of the more upscale sushi places can get away with charging outrageous prices for items that should be cheap (e.g. miso soup or inari). Here, I found that they don't really do that. So props to them.

The restaurant has a good vibe and a cool lounge you can hang out in while you're waiting for your table, which you'll probably have to do. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Madison! The saba is marinated in house, and the Rice is perfect. This restaurant has spoiled me against all the other sushi joints in town."}
{"text":"The sushi is okay but wayyy overpriced. The specialty rolls are 8-piece rolls and most are $16. Two of them are $12. One of the rolls we ordered had some fish that seemed dry and not very fresh, not sure what was going on there. The Maki combo seemed like a really good deal given the original prices of the rolls, as it is 3 rolls (1 specialty, 1 regular, and 1 inside out roll) for $20. 

The service was decent, and though the place seemed like it was trying to have a classy ambiance, the furniture looked and felt very cheap."}
{"text":"Yum! 

What a cute spot in the Hilldale Mall to eat at. My fiance and I had a date night here, we were pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. 

Drinks: We both had the Asian Margarita....so good! 

Sushi: He had Spicy Tuna and I had the New York (Shrimp & Avocado) 

Entrees: He had the Ribeye and I had the Grilled chicken. 

Everything was cooked to perfection. They do only bring out chopsticks and if you're a baby like me, just ask for a fork and knife. We didn't have to wait at all, plus the atmosphere is romantic, and the staff is friendly. I plan on returning to Muramoto!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Madison, but it's pricey and tricky to schedule since they tend to be busy but don't take reservations, at least not for small amounts of people. The food however is absolutely great. If you want the best sushi Madison has to offer and don't mind paying for it then by all means this is the place to go. I do like some of their rolls a lot despite what others have said on here.  One (the name of which escapes me right now) has srirachi hot sauce and is dang tasty to my srirachi-addicted palate. That said, for more low-key sushi cravings I hit the half-price sushi happy hour at Ginza. Their sushi isn't as transcendently delicious as Muramoto but still pretty decent and the happy hour prices are uber cheap."}
{"text":"Passing through Madison,we decided to check this place out.  The Fire roll was good, but that and the fatty salmon barely held together and fell apart soon after being picked up.  My wife was disappointed with her choices but found the Alaska roll, which my kid ordered, to be very good.  So, soon after getting our food we asked for an additional Alaska roll.  

30 minutes later, the Alaska roll still hadn't arrived.  I asked our server how much longer she thinks it would take. She couldn't even give me an estimate. 

We cut our losses and cancelled the order.  Pretty disappointing meal overall."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place in Madison! I'm pretty picky with my sushi as I lived my life on the West coast, and I'm tasted the best in Japan. Sushi Muramoto does not disappoint. The interior design of the restaurant is beautiful and perfect for dates and small groups. The drink menu is very creative and smartly blends Asian flavors into tasty drinks. The quality of the Sushi is amazing for the price. The fish is fresh and more importantly, the rice is toe to toe with the best. If your looking for a nice Sushi dinner, Muramoto is your spot!"}
{"text":"It was ok service from our server. It took him about 6 minutes to come to my mother and I. When he came he never introduced his name and never asked what we wanted to drink. He also never checked in with us. The only reason why this has three stars is because of the amazing quality of sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi Muramoto has great quality fish and great ingredients make great sushi. Delicious food and a modern casual space make this one of my favorite places for sushi in Madison."}
{"text":"The rolls are great! They're very tasty! And I have to say that they're rolled well. I've gone to other places and they do a sloppy job so it falls apart while I'm picking it up--not here! I've had vegetarian rolls, the miso soup, and a chicken lettuce wrap that was delicious! The only complaint is that it's sort of crowded and some of the tables are a little too close together (so you have to sort of walk sideways to get out from behind a table and end up giving the people next to you a nice view of your butt). But that's a small price to pay. It hasn't stopped me from going there.

On busy nights, it could take up to 45 minutes to get a seat, but you could leave your cell # and walk around the mall area until they call you when your table is ready. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Come here for the sushi, not the rolls. Probably the best cuts of fish I've seen anywhere in the U.S. -- certainly better than anything in Chicago or on the east coast. The rolls are very good but not worth $16. 

I thought the service was fine. The positives far outweigh the negatives. And while it's in a \"mall\" it's a super-yuppie mall. 

I definitely plan to go back on my next trip to Madison. Like I said, I haven't found sushi this good in Chicago."}
{"text":"I can't agree more with Shea F., I don't get all of the five star reviews.  The sushi selection is...eh.  The service is incredibly pretentious.  Two check-ins and the first one was alright, but the second pretty much destroyed any positives from the first visit.  

The first Friday we went (and we figured Fridays were safe for deliveries, maybe we were incorrect on this assumption?), the service was decent, we waited patiently for the bar for 30 minutes.

My husband and I have been used to ordering omakase for years now, mostly in LA.  Yes, Sushi Muramoto will give you a big platter of omakase nigiri.  However, it will be drowned in all sorts of sauces.  The actual fish selection wasn't very fresh, and probably reflects the heavy use of sauce.  I realize that the quality of the fish here will just flat out never match the west coast, but what's surprised me the most has been the lack of imagination of the chefs here.  Both times Bee served us almost identical plates of sushi.

But the weirdest thing that we had was sitting down the second time at about 8pm on a Friday night.  Again we waited for the sushi bar (we don't look at that as a negative, just part of going to a sushi place that doesn't take reservations).  We ordered a couple of appetizers, and the waitress served the mussel soup without spoons and promptly disappeared into the kitchen for a good 5 minutes.

When seated, Bee proceeded to avoid all eye contact, and took 20 minutes packing up his station and moving all of his fish to the middle station, cleaned all of the cutting boards and knives, and not a word the entire time.  When I finally caught the tiniest glance (I'm not shy on conversation), I asked him if he was done serving for the evening, and he responded that no, he was just consolidating the particular station.  Last I checked, sushi bars have refrigerated stations precisely so that you do not have to transfer fish around. 

He then proceeded to make us two plates of omakase nigiri that were pretty much identical to what he'd served us the previous week.  Any regular sushi place in LA would dance circles around this, sorry."}
{"text":"I always have very good service at this Hilldale location.  Caunsey is a delight whether he's at the bar or serving tables.  He always remembers me, which makes me feel good.

I would like to be more adventurous with the menu but, really, I just get rolls and nigari on the regular.  You can not beat the Maki Combo for $20.  Fresh and tasty, every time.  So yummy.

The only downfall is on my end that I don't have more friends who like sushi as much as I do."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Madison! My wife and I usually go for lunch, if you're not there before 12 expect a wait. This place is popular. We usually start with the Miso soup and edamame, but recently tried the chicken lettuce wrap - delicious! We mix up the roles we get, I like spicey while my wife favors the simpler roles like Philly and Cali. Service is great, it has a cool vibe to it."}
{"text":"Compared to all the other sushi places in Madison, Muramoto is hands down the best out of everything here. 

The selection of sashimi is surprisingly massive and fresh. 

The rolls are tasty, especially the spicy ones (Volcano is my favorite), but my gripe is that I have consistently had sushi rolls that have fallen apart at a poke of a chopstick. 

Tastes the same but it's annoying to be getting lopsided, lumpy rolls when I'm paying top money for it. 

There are some asian fusion entrees and appetizers available too. I'd say skip those at Sushi Muramoto and take a trip to Restaurant Muramoto for those offerings."}
{"text":"My parents took my husband and I to Sushi Muramoto for a late birthday dinner!  I tried more dishes than I normally would because well, let's face it, the parents were paying.  Our waitress was my favorite kind:  polite, helpful but didn't bug us or return every 10 seconds. 

The meal started with edamame and chicken lettuce wraps.  The wraps were amazing:   sweet, a little crunchy and a delicious and light way to save room for more food.  The edamame was a disappointment-it was freezing cold and slimy, making it the one thing I wouldn't get again.  I ordered the beef ribeye, which was a perfectly seasoned and buttery cut of steak over fresh sautéed veggies.  The sushi I stole from my husband's plate was perfecto and my Dad, the sushi snob, gave this place a thumbs up.  

Being the food hoarder that I am, I took home leftovers and made the best fried rice of my life the next day!"}
{"text":"Great service, good sushi, good location. Good spot to stop in and grab some quick sushi bites. The hot food items are usually incredible! A local favorite."}
{"text":"We don't understand why this restaurant has 4 stars. We've been here twice. Service was cold. I had gunk on my water glass AND miso bowl... Which makes you wonder about the cleanliness. The bathroom was dirty and unkept. 

Miso and sake were just lukewarm. The veggie tempura was served with..... MAYONNAISE! (Mixed with some kind of siracha sauce) really? 

Sushi was ok. Served on top a sweet plum sauce which makes you feel like they are cheating somehow.. This was just not good. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love sushi although I wouldn't say I know all that much about the technique, etc... just that I like when it tastes good! silly, I know. I have always had delicious food (sushi and otherwise) at this location.  The service I think is pretty uppity.. and I'm from Madison and work at Hilldale so that's saying something ;) I also think that it's incredibly expensive. I understand that sushi requires skill and high quality ingredients so the price will always be partly reflected there.. however I prefer Red anyway."}
{"text":"i'd give it 5 stars and say best in madison if i had tried all other spots, which i haven't yet. Place is good and believe it or not my favorite thing here isn't even sushi now that i've been there. Love the pork belly, but, I REALLY have to recommend the hangar steak plate for lunch or the appetizer at dinner. the potato salad garnished with salmon roe is to die for and goes perfect with the medium-rare cooked cut of steak. 
 we sat at the sushi bar and kept our backs turned on the comings and goings at the front of the house. Its also more intimate and allows you to see the attention to detail that goes into the making of your food while holding a private, uninterrupted conversation.  

(i'm originally from W coast, lived in Asia, and don't feel the food is intolerable in the least bit).

___ update: its the bomb! hands down best in Madtown!"}
{"text":"Just wrapped up with dinner at Sushi Muramoto and I must say, it was quite a fulfilling meal. Although, I've been spoiled with better sushi elsewhere, the quality of the food here is very good and I was quite content.

It was a bit of walk hunting through the Hillsdale Shopping Center trying to locate this place. It's not my first time here but it's been a while since I've last came by. When we finally found the place after checking the map, and walking further, we almost missed the right side entrance (the left door is just for show - or I suppose it's an \"emergency\" exit). 

We ordered two appetizers: edamame and steamed mussels. Both were great choices and complemented each other well. The mussels was on the salty end but nonetheless still delicious. 

For our entree, we shared a maki combo (3 different chef choice rolls - which was all a pleasant surprise) and fresh eel (two pieces). All of which was amazing in its own right. 

Overall, I was very satisfied with the quality of our food, and the service was quite excellent. Also, you know a place is authentic when you're offered free hot tea!"}
{"text":"The space is lovely and service was very good. As for the rolls, they were just okay in my opinion. I felt like the menu was rather limited on traditional sushi rolls. So we explored by ordering three of the specialty rolls. I only remember the Rainbow Roll. One of the rolls I didn't even eat because it just wasn't to my liking. 

The best part of my experience was the lychee and grapefruit drink. Whatever that was, I want more of it, a lot more of it. I would return for the drinks for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been before and the food was decent and the service horrible. Have tried to go back twice, but each time upon entering it smells like a fish market. Doesn't give me hope in their sushi when it is so smelly in the restaurant. No other sushi restaurant in Madison has any odor so they need to fix this problem."}
{"text":"Very average food for the price. I can get better sushi at Journey all you can eat restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Super fresh fish and some of the best I have ever had. Consider myself a sushi snob and have had sushi all over the US, from New York to San Francisco and everywhere in between. I hear Sushi Muramoto flies in fresh fish everyday and I believe it. Ate there twice last month and both times it was OUTSTANDING! 

On a down note they are always packed. I refuse to penalize their rating for this because they can't control the fact that everyone wants to eat there. They offer a call back service where you give them your cell phone number and they will call you when your table is ready. Plenty of places to window shop or cruise while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"Been coming hear for years and I can honestly say this offers the BEST lunch deal in Madison. The Sake Cod is so affordable for what they give you, I am amazed they offer this perfect piece of fish for $10. However, it's hard to pass on their awesome sushi. They do it all very well."}
{"text":"Considering Wisconsin is not next to an ocean, still love this place. It's in my favorite shopping area in Madison {Hilldale Mall} & conveniently right across from Sundance Cinema.  The sushi rolls were so good. I think the only thing I would have changed is for them to warm the edamame & add more salt to it.  mmmmm can't wait to go again :)"}
{"text":"I need to express my concern for the direction that Sushi Muramoto is heading.  For the past two years, my family and I have been visiting Sushi Muramoto 1-3 times a month... our favorite go-to restaurant because of our perceived high value.  The benefit of the meal surpassed the high cost and made for an enjoyable dinning experience.

However, over the past 2-3 months my family and I have noticed a dramatic change.  It started with a small thing... the center window of the main dinning room was patched due to some structural issue (water?  cold?).  Then we noticed that the quality of the Sushi and specialty rolls started slipping.  An example from our meal yesterday evening.  The rolls were 3/4 the size and sushi nigiri 2/3 size from just a few months ago.  In addition, the sauces on the specialty rolls have become close to meaningless.  The Hamachi smelled like FISH - never a good thing in a sushi restaurant.  Finally, the edamame skin was falling apart when trying to get to the bean.

The result, my family is going to take our first ever trip to Reds as an alternative.  I am only one customer that is going elsewhere but might be part of a larger trend..."}
{"text":"Sushi was good and fresh. Didn't have a huge selection, but overall satisfied. The house salad is unique and delicious. Small, upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"On the expensive side for Madison eating, but it's easily the best sushi in town. Great decor, wait staff, and tunes. The only disappointing thing is they never have Spanish mackerel!"}
{"text":"Seaweed salad is wonderful.
And fried tofu is delicious with coconut flavor. Overall speaking, the dishes are very Asian! 
Excellent for me with an Asian tongue."}
{"text":"I moved to the US from Japan when I was 18 and have experience working at a Sushi restaurant in Hawaii. When I moved to Madison, I had given up on finding good Japanese food. I couldn't have been more surprised when I discovered this place. 

There are only two sushi restaurants in Madison I would recommend, and this is the first. The sushi and sashimi are 9 out of 10 times \"Tsukiji-quality\" and the sake/shochu list is phenomenal. Whenever a friend comes to visit, this is the second place we go (beer and cheese curds take priority when in Madison, right?). The staff are friendly and always greet me with a smile. They really help me feel at home.

Recently, Sushi Muramoto opened a bar on the other side of the restaurant, and started serving real Japanese \"Izakaya-style\" foods, like Tako-Wasabi, Shio-Kara, and Moro-Q. Some of these items I cannot find anywhere else in Wisconsin. There's usually a 20 min wait for a table, so having these rare delicacies during the wait time is a treat. They make excellent side dishes for that first beer of the night ;)

The price is more than reasonable for the quality of seafood you get. The sea urchin, ama-ebi, scallop, and salmon roe are always top notch. It's not cheap, but comapred to a similar-tier restaurant in Honolulu, NYC, or SF, Sushi Muramoto is a bargain.

The only complaint I have (and they know) is the lack of Tamago on their sushi menu. One time they did take off my favorite shochu off the list, but it's back! Otherwise, fish is great, beverage menu is great, and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Craving sushi we found this place. We started with the pork belly and my friend had the calamari, and let me tell you that was some really good pork. The favor was such a deep umami with a sourness from the pickled radish and sweet of the reduction backed by the heat of the jalepeño. Simply balanced and amazing. Not to take away from the calamari which was tender and fried perfectly with a sauce that was salty with a bit of heat. The entree was their big plate and it included a roll and 8 pieces of sashimi. The sashimi was extremely fresh and was each a different fish, and the spicy roll was excellent. Great sushi amazing appetizers."}
{"text":"Great place if you're in the mood for sushi down in Madison. There's a few others in town, but I went here once and just loved it from that point forward so I don't know how it compares.

I've been at least four times or so, and every tiime it's been a home run.Great quality fish, and the sashi cuts were generous, fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"One of the top two sushi restaurants in Madison.  Caution if you plan to come with a group larger than 4, best to call ahead and snag a limited reservation or prepare to wait 1+ hours.  Service is perfect here every single time (literally we've probably dined here 10-15 times this year already).  Drinks are glorious, the asian margarita is a favorite of mine along with the lychee martini.  And of course the sushi never disappoints (the fire specialty roll is a must).  Have a non-sushi eater in your group?  No problem, their main entrees are just as amazing as the sushi so no one has to sacrifice!"}
{"text":"Good service and good sushi. Not the highest quality sushi but pretty good considering the area. I like the ambience particularly."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent sushi. And really, I did not find the prices to be that outrageous. I had dinner for two, with alcohol and an appetizer and the whole thing was under $50. Everything was superb, from my extra strong and yummy Saketini, to the exquisite lobster rolls in a hollandaise sauce we had preceeding our meal and my crispy duck was quite tasty and well done.  Most definitely will be returning."}
