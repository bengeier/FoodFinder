{"text":"I always go here for lunch. The prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty good. Prob my most favorite restaurant in South Charlotte. All their chicken dishes are amazing especially the Szechuan chicken. The sushi tastes fresh as well. And I love that they have the all you can eat sushi buffet during lunch."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR CHUAN WANG FU  Probably the best Chinese food in the greater Charlotte area. I haven't been to Lee's yet in Fort Mill, but this place has been the most impressive so far. We were confused because when we sat down we were only given menus for Umai's Sushi. So, we apologized to our waitress to let her know we were in the wrong restaurant, and were leaving. She asked us what restaurant and we showed her this Yelp page. She said we were in the right place and then went to grab a different menu. That was a little weird and presumptuous to not offer us the Chinese menu. I noticed a white guy came in later and wanted to do take out, and they gave him the Umai Sushi menu only, and he said he did not want that menu either.  Anyway, we had the spicy shrimp which was fried and served with lots of dried chili and had a bit of a lemon grassy flavor. It was pretty good, my partner wanted some type of sauce on it but I didn't find it necessary. (I will say, I noticed some of the shrimp was not cleaned of the digestive tract, which is lazy on behalf of the kitchen. Another review commented on this as well) Aside from that, get this dish. Large shrimp and big portion, enough to feed four.  The soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao were not bad but seemed a bit smaller than usual, and we were not given proper utensils to eat with it (a miso spoon). Still worth ordering, because Xiao Long Bao is hard to come by in Charlotte, y'all.  My partner insisted we get beef lo mein which I'm tired of. The beef lo mein here is NOT good. I've had better beef lo mein from a mall food court. Sorry if that's rude, just being honey. It was pretty tired and dry.  The white rice here is good and not overly dry.  We ordered the dried fried green beans with preserved vegetable and pork. FUCKING GET THIS! It's so good, and was an awesome vegetable selection. I'm trying to make this for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.   Kung Pao chicken pieces were smaller than anticipated but it was your typical fair with a bit more of a sweetness than I was expecting, but that's America for y'all.   The portions here are big and the price is reasonable. There were some hits and some misses, but compared to all the other Chinese options around, this place is the best. You will find a mix of authentic and American-Chinese, also American style sushi if ya want."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service. I'm really happy to have found a good sushi place so close to home!"}
{"text":"Environment 3.5; Friendliness 5+; *Food Taste 3.5; Service 5+ I have no real grips. I would definitely go back again and recommend. I did not eat the Sushi, instead preferring to eat a plated  meal, (Teriyaki steak, rice, veggies and salad.) The food was served quickly and at perfect temperature. My teriyaki was not the classic taste and had no discernible sweetness or even a hint of ginger.  The meat was very tender and I still enjoyed it. All else was perfect! I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"This place was the worst. I loved the sushi but the customer service was the absolute worst. The women that took our orders and drinks acted completely apathetic to ours need. The food took forever to come out and what happened to know when to refill a glass. I had the unlimited and waited forever again for the to come get my other order while they were all eating in the back. I have my respect and got no respect in return. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"They used to serve sushi. After being sold to the current owner, they add a great Chinese menu to it. If you wanna try real Chinese food, ask for their Chinese food menu. They do an excellent job."}
{"text":"My go to place for sushi! You have to try this place, especially check out they're all you can eat sushi deal!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with brother & buddy and had the 3 roll lunch: tuna, crispy California & yellowtail + salad for $11. Bro got crispy California & crispy bagel, buddy got garlic beef plate & spicy tuna. Lunch was good and prices ok but 2 of 3 (myself, buddy) got food poisoning, both missed work today. He called to warm them, will see what he says....most likely won't be going back...."}
{"text":"We eat here quite frequently. It's a good and quick sushi spot, usually not busy. They also have a sushi buffet everyday for a decent price but the selection is limited compared to their full menu."}
{"text":"The service of the waitress who name is \"Jen\" is really terrible. The food is ok, but overprice. Really bad experience."}
{"text":"This is a new sushi place in the Quail Corner shopping center.  I am very impressed with their quality of food and service.  The sushi is so fresh and the chinese menu is delectable.  I really enjoy their basil beef and their arrange of appetizers are very satisfying.  I definitely recommend the salt mackeral as well as the fried octopus.  Overall this is a place that I will be visiting often."}
{"text":"I can't recommend ever ordering from this place, especially delivery  My order was wrong in several ways.  One item was completely wrong.  They filed my tempura order with onions after I asked for none. And the pieces had been dropped in some thing else but still packaged up.  I don't know what sauce they included with the tempura but it was horrible.  The roll, rising sun, was just plain awful.  It was made of some weird crunchy fish that I couldn't taste over the breading."}
{"text":"Rarely does an Asian restaurant impress as much as this one did. Came here with my family on a Monday night. The atmosphere was inviting,  the service outstanding,  and the food absolutely delicious. I think we ate the best Sesame Chicken that we've ever had. Heads up about the Marilyn Monroll - spicy doesn't begin to describe it!! Definitely can see this becoming a favorite...."}
{"text":"Been here 20 times with great results but today the shrimp was rank. My while table smelled it. Staff couldnt seem to smell it. Oh well."}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan cuisine! It would be a great place to eat if the service gets improved."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! YES!  If you like Sushi/Asian food you have GOT to check this place out!!!   Having been in the service industry for majority of my working life I'm always expecting the best of best service. And that is exactly what I got!!!!   From the moment our server, Justin, came to our table I knew I was in for a wonderful dinning experience. He had such a wonderful, vibrant presence about him. He was funny and attentive and didn't spend TOO much time at our table like some servers have a problem doing.   We started off taking his suggestion of the special on drinks and had an amazing saketini! DELICIOUS! So good we had to have a second round! (Careful, they will sneak up on you!)   I started off with miso soup and a salad with ginger dressing- I LOVE ginger dressing. Theirs is amazing!!!Following that we split an assortment of sushi!  Oh. My. God!!! It was incredible. It was SO fresh!!! So delicious. I highly recommend trying the tuna royal roll. OM NOM NOM!!!!  I really wanted to try dessert, but I just didn't have any room- I'll remember for next time to leave room to give it a shot!!  So yeah- for sure you HAVE to ask for Justin to be your server, order a sakatini, sushi and if you still have room for desert I'm sure it's absolutely incredible as well!!!  It was so refreshing to dine at a place and have such an AMAZING experience.   I wish I could give infinite stars!  Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good but the service was terrible. We were missing salads and spring rolls. Brought me part of my order with other random rolls. Didn't even bring another person w my group theirs. They said they must've given it to the wrong table. Constantly had servers ask if we order various foods because they didn't know where it was supposed to go."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had since moving to Charlotte. Sashimi was super fresh, they had interesting, delicious rolls and the service was excellent...I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi lunch for $14.99?!? It's definitely worth ever penny. All the sushi is still made to order, not just sitting out on a buffet. Servers have been wonderful and environment is clean, modern style. Try today, but beware of the sushoma (sushi induced coma) that can follow after eating so much good sushi. It can put you out of commission for a few hours!"}
{"text":"Good sushi/Asian food at reasonable prices. Great lunch specials. Hibachi meals great. Kids selections. All good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  If you want authentic Szcheuan you need to be here.   Come prepared to be amazed."}
{"text":"Delicious specialty rolls and great lunch special with all you can eat sushi. Tuna is excellent. The wait staff (we've seen four different people) are all wonderful and I will go back for the great service. A little on the pricey side and I was not a fan of the ginger dressing on the house salad. But we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy poop in your food?  Me neither.  But, nonetheless my shrimp noodles came with tons of it.  The kitchen needs a lot of work in cleaning shrimp.  The sesame chicken was chewy and flavorless, the steak hibachi tasted like pot roast.  A+ on the cream cheese wontons and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious, the decor is classy and pleasant, the staff and drinks were great. I live 25 min away and it's worth the drive, even though I live nearby other sushi places. Veggie tempura was awesome. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Never disappointed by the Sichuan menu. Dan-Dan noodles are da bomb, as is every other dish I've had here. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday, two other tables besides me. Service terrible, food mediocre.  Sorry don't get previous reviews."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up in Quail Corners. Their lettuce wraps are delicious and you chose chicken, shrimp OR tofu. Their sushi is excellent and the rolls are a good size.  Definetly give this place a try!"}
{"text":"2nd time eating at Umai and most likely the last.  It's not that it is terrible....  It's just not that good.  Reviewing their lunch \"special\", the amount of each component within the roll is just off, not to mention, the rolls are just sloppily thrown together.  Everybody likes cream cheese, but that shouldn't be the only thing you taste.  Or what's up with the huge chunk of cucumber?  Also, the ginger dressing for the house salads... Ugh!  It must come from a jar because if I weren't at a Sushi & Asian Bistro, I wouldn't necessarily know that it is ginger dressing.  Again, it's not terrible but just not that good.  My 1st experience was for dinner a few weeks ago.  I was craving hibachi and gave Umai's a try.  I will say it was quite the generous portion, I got two meals out of it.  But it's not exactly steak.  I had ordered online and specified that I wanted my \"steak\" medium rare.  What I received was the same beef that you would find in a Chinese favorite like 'Beef and Broccoli' so to call it steak is definitely misleading.  For the $17 price tag, you would expect a better cut of meat."}
{"text":"Food was delicious -- maybe some of the best sushi I have ever had -- prices were excellent as well -- will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Enjoying a beautiful night on Umai's patio enjoying a cold Kirin and edamame. Love the sushi here as it consistently good and fresh. Friendly vibe and good service. Nice atmosphere. Excellent service that goes out of their way to accommodate. Best kept secret."}
{"text":"The sushi is some of the best I've had.  Great service. The Marilyn Monroll is excellent. Umai is a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"We came to this place a couple of times earlier and really liked it, mainly because the man in charge was very friendly and efficient in terms of getting the food out. But on our last visit he wasn't there, and the place was a disaster. I ordered the all-you-can-eat sushi ($16) and was immediately told by the server that I couldn't share with others at the table, I couldn't take any to go, etc. Hey -- I already knew that, ok? Don't start off by nagging me about it. Anyway, we were there for an hour and I got exactly one serving of mediocre sushi because the service was so horrible. I reordered twice but the other orders never showed up. My wife ordered off the regular sushi menu and her sushi was cold, which was odd because she had to wait a long time for it. Did it just sit there at the sushi station for 30 minutes or so getting cold?  The spring rolls were greasy,. The \"fried rice\" was a lump of unfried rice with a couple carrots in it. So: terrible service, below average food. And the prices are not what you'd call cheap. Go somewhere else. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Finally found a Szechuan restaurant in Charlotte... it's probably the most authentic place in town."}
{"text":"I've been exploring my new neighborhood and found this gem.  We started off with the lettuce wraps (gf is vegetarian so went with tofu) and they were awesome.  After apps, moved onto and really enjoyed the surf and turf specialty roll.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere for any date night or casual dining experience.  Looking forward to visit again!"}
{"text":"Well, it was not amazing. There are better places in Charlotte to get sushi. And we were over charged for our drinks! Aside that, the service was great and the place is nice. Would I go back? Likely no."}
{"text":"The food was SO GOOD. They're fried rice was \"slap ya mama\" good. But I wouldn't recommend going because they're service.. IS TRASH. They run around like chickens with their head cut off. I remember I ordered some more Sushi, never got that until it was time for me to leave. We ordered rice, almost didn't get it because we had to leave. ALSO, they expect a tip. But i surely didnt want to tip someone who did a bad job. They barely attend to people. This elderly lady was ready to go & she was waiting patiently at first but got fed up, & told them she wants her check so they can go. I would love to go back if the service wasnt so bad."}
{"text":"Looking for a sushi lunch buffet on a Monday afternoon and trusty Yelp brought me to Umai. I was expecting a buffet style, but turned out to be made to order.  The selection was if basic negiri and rolls, no specialty rolls. Service and quality was fine, but the selection was disappointing.  I'd be willing to give it another go if I were in the neighborhood, but not worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"This place is amazingggg I can't say enough great things about their lunch special.  So it's $14.95 all you can eat but instead of it being a buffet like most places, you get a menu that has all the sushi options on it, plus you can order spring rolls, rice, etc. and its all included! The waiter was awesome and explained the set up perfectly.  You can order as much sushi as you want your first round of ordering the only thing they ask is that you finish all the food you ordered before ordering more so they don't have to waste food (which is awesome) it also makes you take your time so you don't end up wobbling out of the restaurant from consuming too much sushi!  The spring rolls are made to order too and the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is in my neighborhood and I went with friends and found an unexpected surprise, they have traditional Sichuan. I got the regular menu at first but asked for the \"hot pot\" menu. The owner was very helpful, I explained I just got back from Hong Kong and glad i found this place."}
{"text":"One of best dining experiences ever!! Excellent service, excellent food...can't say enough good about this place. Patio seating and ambiance was great too. Benson was our server and was again...EXCELLENT!! Marylyn monroll delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ramen was tasty.  Sushi was good.  Ordered through Door Dash and would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Best Asian food in south charlotte ... Love this place! Never disappoints in serving delicious sushi and fantastic desserts !  Two thumbs way up !"}
{"text":"I went for the all-you-can-eat lunch sushi last week after much deliberation on which sushi lunch buffet I should try.  We were the first ones seated for lunch on a Friday and quickly chose our rolls.  Unfortunately, that was the last quickly that I can write.  We ended up ordering two times and we barely got out of there in an hour.  Not sure what happened with that..  So the sushi, it started out decent.  Spicy Tuna, Tuna Avocado, California, Crunch California... but the second time around, it started to be more evident that this was AYCE sushi lunch & not quality sushi.  I really liked the ambiance of Umai and maybe I'll come back and try something for dinner - or a lunch bento box, but I think that may be my last all you can eat sushi lunch."}
{"text":"It ain't that Godzilla roll tho!!!   Okay this review is for a to go order. I'm always searching for that alternative. My dude and I didn't feel like going all the way uptown (they were probably closed anyway) for Fujo. So trusty Yelp reviews showed some decent ratings for this place.   The sushi is aight. The surf and turf roll had decent flavor but it was missing something. What... I don't know but it needed something for it to be great.   I also ordered the shrimp tempura. A simple and cheap roll so I didn't expect anything great.   I was looking for an explosion in my mouth buuuuuut I guess this ain't the place to give me that.   AH WELL!!!  I'll go back and try the regular food.   The service was good. Quick and accommodating when I asked for some extra ginger and low sodium soy sauce.   Yea I'll give it another go... Dine in and regular food."}
{"text":"A fantastic sushi restaurant! They were very fair with their all you can eat sushi lunch! Everything the served was very high quality and delicious . I cant wait to come back one day for dinner. The decor is wonderful and the staff is incredibly accommodating. We wanted to watch the Panthers game and they moved us inside right in front of the TV! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi, great hibachi selections, and reasonable kids selections. I'll definitely be back and I suggest you try them also."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi rolls at $12 a person incl a drink.  Not bad at all.  The wait & host staff seems to be on the youngish side & seemed to be there more to gossip or point at customers & laugh vs. serving customers.  Wait & host staff aside.  The sushi rolls were tasty & came out pretty quickly considering the amount of customers at the time.  The owner picked up the slack from the employees & made sure we were taken care of.  The ginger dressing on the salad had a more tangy flavor & wish I knew what brand they use."}
{"text":"First time here.. Other than being out of a couple of draft beers, it was amazing. Sushi was the best we've had in town and the service was great.  Great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!!."}
{"text":"Really delicious lunch special made to order. No sketch buffet here. On a recent visit I sat outside and stuffed my face with nigiri. I never even made it inside on that visit, the team kept my water glass full and brought water out for my pup too.  I visited again this week for a late omgeeee starving why didn't we eat until 9pm style dinner. The food came out Jimmy Johns style- freaky fast!  The dumplings hit the spot right away, standard but a nice portion. Y'all weren't kidding about the spice level of the Marilyn Monroll- pow. Really creative and delicious though. I was also pleased with the $6-8 roll section the bagel roll never disappoints although I wish they noted on the menu it comes topped with a mayo-based sauce. If you are in this part of town and are craving sushi this may be your only/best option without going to Southpark."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why this is so highly rated. Sushi is poor quality and doesn't taste fresh. It's definitely cheap - but I can't even say that it's worth the price because I've had better sushi rolls for the same price, if not cheaper."}
{"text":"Great service and sushi. Surprisingly not that busy on a regular basis. Prices and variety are good as well. Try the lychee nut sake, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese restaurant! Big menu with a variety of sushi rolls. Their special rolls are very unique - many feature mango which is delicious! We love the tonkotsu ramen as well!  The restaurant is definitely popular, so be prepared for a wait on the weekends. It's worth it though! Bring good friends for good conversation over good food!"}
{"text":"So let me first say this was my first sushi since moving to Charlotte. Umai had some big shoes to fill as the sushi restaurant I went to in Orlando, I loved. Umai was almost as good definitely worth going back for a second time. I had the shrimp tempura roll and the XOXO roll. The tempura was just your typical tempura roll which is my go to roll and I loved it. The XOXO was just ok in my opinion. It had mango, cream cheese and basil. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil so I probably would try a different roll next time. The reason for the 4 rating was my husband does not like sushi so it's hard to find a sushi restaurant with good \"other\" food and he loved his food! He got a miso soup, that I tried, and it was refreshingly delicious. Also ordered an appetizer of potato croquette which is like fried mashed potatoes with cheese and corn also really good!! For his main meal his ordered the chicken hibachi dinner with fried rice. He claims the best food he's had at a sushi restaurant, which is saying a lot for him! For the service, our waiter was really friendly and we loved the atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. This was my first time trying real, authentic Szechuan food and let me say- this place is an absolute mind blower. I could not be happier with the service- our server seemed to be really excited when we asked for the Szechuan menu (it's a separate menu you have to ask for).  A buddy and I started with a couple of eggrolls and some crab rangoon. Both dynamite. For the main course we split the Cumin Beef, the Beef with Chili Oil and the spicy chicken. This was my first real experience with Szechuan peppers and it will most definitely not be my last. They have a building intensity of heat with an almost numbing sensation that makes you want to keep eating.  This was the first of many, many visits. I can't wait to try everything else!"}
{"text":"I travel down to Charlotte pretty often for work and this place is my go to for sushi! I order from this place once or twice a week and it's always delicious. I usually get a nirigi or sashimi combo and a few items from their specialty nigiri - usually toro, uni, or soft shell crab. They do their portions right and give nice thick cuts of fish. Occasionally I'll get some of their rolls . All very good!   Food Rating: 4.5/5 Service Rating: 4.5/5 Ambiance Rating: 4/5"}
{"text":"My review is only based on my experience with the all you can eat lunch. Stopped in for the \"all you can eat\" lunch buffet, at the suggestion of a friend whom said it was good. The food quality was not too bad, service was pretty good, and it seemed like a nice clean place.  The lunch deal is $14/person, and not really a buffet, but you can order unlimited off a small menu. It was a pretty slim sushi roll selection, and about 8 different nigiri choices. Only about 4 fish options for nigiri. They also offer rice or spring rolls which was cool, and the spring rolls were good and came out fast. Not amazing, but the fish tasted fresh, and the service was good. Will I be back someday? Sure. I would like to try them for dinner sometime, with a more expanded menu option."}
{"text":"Good sushi in Charlotte! Girlfriend and I went here for a date lunch, and we both thought the fish was fresh and the prices were reasonable.  I got the sushi lunch with side ginger salad, and she got the all you can eat $14 sushi lunch special.  Service was reasonably fast, and bill came $25 for the two of us.  Not a bad place to go when craving some raw fish!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The sushi is awesome- so fresh. The staff is friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is modern but relaxing. Great lunch special and for dinner the Marilyn monroll is sooo good! Love it."}
{"text":"Three of us ate there for lunch today, was not impressed.  There was only one other table eating when we arrived.  One person at the table ordered hibachi, one got the all you can eat sushi for $16, and I ordered bento box.  The hibachi was pretty good.  The bento box.. meh.  The all you can eat sushi menu stated you could get 8 rolls at a time, yes that's alot.  She ordered 6.  They brought her only 4 after taking her order and said she could only get more once she finished so not to waste.  Why not state 4 instead of saying you can get 8?!  My bento box came late so I took a piece of sushi while waiting.  She rushed over and said YOU CANNOT SHARE!  They all proceeded to stare at us for the rest of the time we ate.  It was very uncomfortable and not appreciated. Its not like I didn't order my own food to try to get away with eating half off...  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I got hibachi shrimp. Small portions. I'm small and was still hungry after. Food tasted ok."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with sushi and love the all you can eat sushi lunch. You are limited to a smaller menu with no \"specialty\" rolls but there is still plenty of options. The crunchy rolls are yummy and the mango roll was surprisingly good. I really recommend this restaurant AND am excited to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Holy Sushi Lunch Special Batman!!!  This lunch special was fantastic, it's a little pricier than I like for lunch - coming in at $16 per person. But the quality of the food makes up for all of it.  I rocked lunch with Sammy J (duh). You're allowed to order 8 items per \"round\". So that the kitchen can keep up with you. I loved the salmon and avocado roll - it was cooked, and used a smokey salmon. And the spring rolls!  Fresh and tasty, although the cabbage fell out with every bite. I highly recommend this for lunch, it's $16, but totally worth it.  Come hungry."}
{"text":"Probably one of the fewest places that has authentic Chinese food and not westernized versions of it.  The food portions are large and can be shared. I can't speak for the sushi here but the Sichuan cuisine is fantastic; full of spices and very hot! One order can easily feed two people.  This place gets extremely busy on the weekends around 7-8PM, so the service might not be as fast as it should be. However, the service is good."}
{"text":"Tried the all you can eat sushi. Fresh nothing special okay amount of fish larger amounts of rice. Ru Sans sushi buffet superior for variety and rice to fish ratio"}
{"text":"First time here. We arrived around 4pm and there was only one other table with guests. Hubby had some nigiri, loving the salmon most of all. I opted for something different, so I got the Kung Pao Chicken. The sauce was lighter and thinner than I expected, so I felt less guilty eating it. Not a big fan of slices of chicken, though, like this and they were a little on the tough to cut side. Nice, light option, though. Service was great. And they had Kirin light!"}
{"text":"This is actually a Chinese Sichuan restaurant in disguise. Their Sichuan menu is better than all Chinese restaurant and on par with Lee Cafe."}
{"text":"Me and my husband ordered the buy one get one free sushi and it was absolutely delicious very fresh very upscale but very laid-back as well I love this place and will continue going to as long as I live in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Place has gone down tremendously.  One sign besides the service being wickedly bad is they have ceased serving liquor. If you go, good luck."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fresh Sushi. Flavor is unbeat, and service is great. If you are in Charlotte and looking for great Sushi... don't waste your time trying to eat the flat tasting sushi at the mall.... come here!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, nice place to eat weather it's just lunch with your Mom, to catch the game, or for a romantic date night. My personal favorite is the Marilyn Monroe roll. It's a must have w/ shrimp tempura & a slice of jalepeno. Try it out, you won't be dissappinted."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  I had the Dragon, spider and tarantula rolls.  They were amazing.  Absolutely amazing, that's all i can say.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely polite.  I wish I were starting in Charlotte longer, just to be able to go tob this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at Umai four times and each time it has been outstanding!  Not a sushi lover so thoroughly enjoy the chinese menu. My favorite dish is Basil Shrimp with extra basil! We received excellent and personable service. Bobby was our waiter and made sure we were well taken care of. I live nearby so thrilled to find this excellent restaurant! HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the most authentic Chinese food thus far in Charlotte. I was born in China and grew upon Chinese food both at home and in Los Angeles. This is good.. And so close to my house. Didn't think charlotte had it in this city. Plenty of warm up dishes for your more moderate friends too. But this is real Chinese if anyone is interested. This food has been around for thousands of years folks."}
{"text":"This store food recycling back to continue to sell guests to eat, very sick boss, very sick shop, we boycott him???"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you really want sushi. And when you want sushi, you want truckloads of it. Like skip breakfast so that you can eat, eat, eat. And so that's what I did.  Good service on a weekday lunch when the restaurant wasn't even half filled. My waiter took my order slip and a few minutes later, brought me a platter of maki sushi rolls and nigiri sushi. Something with avocado and eel, some tuna, some salmon, some tamago. Even a pair of makerel nigiri. What's great here is that there was no attitude from the server when he asked if I would like another slip to place another order. That's nice.  Did I get my money's worth? Yes. The fish is fresh and tasty. It's not a massive selection and it's not tremendously high end, but what they do is very good. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Healthy portioned kids meal chicken hibachi. Delicious rising sun roll. Very very friendly fast service.  Tasteful relaxing decor."}
{"text":"Love this new place, located in a new shopping area. Clean, modern, and sleek is what I like in a restraurant...and I do love me some sashimi! They have all you can eat $12 sushi buffet during lunch time, which is perfect when you're looking for a quick fix during your busy weekdays lunch! So this is a win win situation.  Everything was fresh and brought out quickly. We had a chance to enjoyed it last Saturday and the owner even came out to ask how was everything. That makes us feel very welcomed. More restaurants should do this!  My favorite was the tempura roll, warm, crunchy outside but moist inside and just a punch in flavor in one! Yum! I'll be coming back to try out more dishes from this place again! They also try new sushi rolls every few mons so I can't wait to see what's in store!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to check out the Szcheuan offerings.  Delish!   I had Mao Po Tofu, a dish that I love, but often can't find, and my husband had the Kung Pao chicken.   It was fresh, authentic, spicy (but not overly spicy), and not heavy.   It is a little bit quiet during the day for lunch.  I think that I would enjoy getting a whole wok fried fish with a group of friends in the evening.   I hope that they have success with the Szcheuan side of things.   There are plenty of sushi, but we have a real lack of authentic Chinese in this city!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi, very polite staff. Large clean location. Looks new. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for. Dragon Roll $14, Miso soup $3, regular rolls $7ish."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is so highly rated.   I've been here at least 4 times. Once was for the all you can eat buffet - the service was slow, sushi decent but came out very sporadically and edamame orders upon sitting down came out about 15 minutes after the sushi.   Went a couple more times and it was decent.   Most recently ordered take out. Ordered in person, asking a few specific questions about the sushi pointing out something I did not like (the minced salmon versus the one larger piece in the roll) and they let me know the rolls I ordered had what I preferred. Picked up sushi along with a hot Chinese dish for my fiancé, sushi is wedged in the middle of the hot dishes and hot when I take it out, and the rolls had what I specifically said I didn't want.   I know I sound pretty high maintenance about this (I probably am) but if you know what you like for sushi  and want decent service if you're going to spend $12+ on each roll, go somewhere else in Charlotte (like Sushi Guru)."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this side of town, and were hopeful that Umai would be our new \"go to\" spot for sushi. Having been spoiled like crazy by the wonderful sushi and value at New Zealand on Monroe, and still saddened by the closing of Mai Sushi at Colony/Rea, we ventured down to Quail Corners in search of our new neighborhood spot. While the atmosphere is great, the food was not our cup of tea. We started with an order of edamame, which is difficult to mess up. But the beans were clearly not fresh - they tasted like they had been frozen too long because the texture was mealy and the pods were wimpy. Move on to the sushi order - a couple of sake (salmon nigiri) and a spicy tuna hand roll. Well, it was all.. okay. The fish was fine, but nothing special. It was all pretty much tasteless, in fact I think the sushi I've picked up from the fridge in Harris Teeter was tastier, and half the price. I mean, I would eat it if I were really desperate for sushi, but considering how close we are to SouthPark, Park Road Shopping Center, etc., and the fact that Umai's prices are pretty steep for what you get, I would definitely head in another direction the next time I crave sushi.  Now let's talk noodles for a second - because my son is pretty much a ramen afficionado. He is only 12, but has been eating ramen noodles since he could eat solid foods (not the kind that come out of the wrapper). He has an amazing palate, and he certainly does know good ramen... and this was the worst he's ever tasted (according to him). The broth was just wrong (I tasted it, too), like maybe they added some miso then boiled it, which is a huge no no, or maybe the broth had been revived from the day before one too many times. I have no idea, but all I know is that we're not fans. The ramen noodles had pork as the protein, and the texture was tough and inedible. I've never seen my son leave a bowl of noodles uneaten, but despite our best efforts to salvage it with a touch of soy sauce and some sriaracha, we just had to let it go.   Just for full disclosure - I did order a seafood stir fry dish carry out for my husband and he ate every last bite - but he's not really that picky and he was really hungry... The dish was $18, so it should have been way better than \"good\" in my opinion. It didn't look any better than the seafood dish we've ordered from Chi Thai (in Arboretum Harris Teeter) for years and years, and was much more expensive.   Anyway - I've had better in Charlotte. If you like authentic tastes and textures of Japanese food, you are probably better to steer clear of Umai."}
{"text":"To be fair, I think this place is OK. For $14, I am not really feeling like this place has impressed me. I like that they do not encourage wasting food, on the menu it specifically says that you must finish ALL food before requesting for more if you choose the buffet menu. You are also not allowed to leave the rice of the sushi. The problem is, if you are a first timer and is not sure what you are ordering, you are pretty much doing hit or miss. Also, if you happen to not like what you get, well, tough luck?  The price for all you can eat sushi is $14, it is from monday to sunday from 11-3. You are also allowed to order unlimited spring rolls, which comes with duck sauce, and white rice, brown rice or fried rice. Other than that, you better REALLY like sushi.  They give you a sheet to order your sushi off, the rolls comes in 4 pieces, if you get nigiri, there is one piece. Like someone below me said, that's kinda like a sushi sampler. I only tried the squid nigiri, and that is pretty fresh quality wise. However, I am bummed this place doesn't have sashimi. All sushi comes with a big chunk of rice at this place and honestly, you can't really order all that much, so you decide if it's worth the $14 for lunch.  Customer service is very good, no complaint, except of course minor gossip between waiters which is typical of Asian places.  Not sure if I will be back...cute decor though I suppose, love the bubbling waterfall at the front entrance."}
{"text":"We drive the extra miles to eat here or get take out.  There is a popular Chinese takeout closer to home but it does not compare with the quality and taste of the food from Umai. The sushi, meats and veggies taste so fresh, the martini's are very good and the staff  is always friendly.  It is now one of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"This is a first class place with great atmosphere I am definitely coming back here food was awesome.  All you can eat sushi at lunch for $14 is an incredible deal."}
{"text":"I love that this place caters to so many different tastes, with both authentic Chinese dishes (yes, authentic) and Japanese dishes + sushi as well! They manage to do both really well too. We came for lunch and it was decently full. Service was a little wacky with many different waitresses and servers coming to our table but they were all cordial.   There is a sushi buffet for lunch, but they also have an option where you can get 2 rolls for $7 or 3 rolls for $9. It was so cheap that my expectations weren't very high but the sushi was definitely better than some fancier/more expensive rolls I've had in the past. They are small, but 2 is perfect if you aren't super hungry. I like how there isn't a super thick coating of rice around the fish, which happens at other buffet places.  I'd recommend the buffet if you have a large appetite or came with a large group of people. I also tried a spicy beef dish off the Chinese szichuan menu and it was very tender. It is definitely spicy though.   For the price and quality, this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon only to find out that there was nobody who understood how to use it, so they advised we couldn't use it. Apparently there was only one person who could do it. Went to Rusty's instead, amazing fries and good sandwiches.. skip this place I would say.."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  I'm glad a nice sushi spot has opened up near me. It looks really nice on the inside. I usually go in the daytime. They now have a pretty good lunch special. Including sushi!!    You are greeted at the door by a hostess, I usually prefer to sit at the bar (so i can see the sushi be prepared). I haven't had bad service any of the times that I've been here. I dont get the same thing when I go, so i always order sushi. All of the rolls that i've ordered have been spot on. With none really standing out as a MUST HAVE. However, the egg rolls are very good and crispy & crunchy.  (I think they are only 1 buck during lunch..i think) They have pretty good Sake as well. I've tried a few and really liked them.  I have and will return, maybe....justttttt maybe i will order an entree and get something more than Just shushi.   Until next time, TTFN"}
{"text":"This place got me in on their all you can eat sushi deal, it's Monday-Friday until 3:00. It's a nice size restaurant with a sleek decor. I came in on a Friday for lunch and it was slow. The all you can eat deal gives you 4 prices of sushi which is a bit of a sample in my eyes. I may have to try their regular priced rolls to see the difference.  For the deal you have the option for all the basic rolls, no house rolls on the list. I would come here again to get my sushi fix if I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"This place is just okay in my opinion- the sushi is decent and pretty cheap but I'm never really wowed.  Last night I had the veggie tempura appetizer, the tiger roll and the eel/avocado roll. The tempura was very large for the price ($6) but didn't have a ton of flavor. The tiger roll didn't taste very fresh and it wasn't that great. The eel avocado roll by contrast was pretty good! Turns out I liked the most basic thing I ordered the best.   From looking around it seemed like the regular entrees looked a lot yummier than the sushi, so if I go back I'll probably give one of those a try."}
{"text":"Been coming to Umai regularly for the past year. They just changed it up and added a full Szechuan menu.This place just got even better. Make sure you ask for the Szechuan menu and ask the server for help. They are all super nice in there."}
{"text":"I had the Marilyn Monroll and it was good but ordered The One and it was bland and poorly rolled. My overall experience felt rushed. I was there for and hour and the server checked on me 20 times and would take plates before I was done. Not the worst place but certainly not the best."}
{"text":"Today was my birthday and I was so disappointed with myself for picking this place. The sushi was less than average. One of our sushi rolls was the surf & turf. It was extremely bland and the beef definitely wasn't filet mignon. It was so chewy that I had to spit it out. I ordered a glass of merlot that was delivered to me in a dirty glass. The waitress was very polite and went to get me a new glass of wine but I was still unimpressed at that point. I would have been better off picking up fast food. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"After passing Umai and seeing some recent reviews I wanted to check it out. I decided to order a variety of items to get a good idea of the overall food at Umai. I started with the edamame and spring roll. Both really good. The edamame was topped with sea salt and warm to the bite, yum! The spring roll was also great, lightly fried and not greasy, with a variety of veggies inside. So, my starters were the best part of the meal.  Onto the sushi. I ordered salmon nigiri, a spicy tun hand roll and the Japanese Mafia roll. The salmon was good. Spicy Tuna, ugh! Unfortunately there were a lot of tuna veins throughout the roll and it was hot, and not hot in a good way. Oh, and to top it off I received a roll of entire rice, and not a hand roll. And, as for the Japanese Mafia, it is a cooked roll, but the fish was cook too long that it smelled and ruined the flavor of what was meant to be. I did enjoy the crab salad in the roll though, since you usually see crab sticks. Overall, everything was okay, but not a sushi spot I would run back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and the handed us an all you can eat menu. Service was mediocre. Pretended they couldn't speak English when we asked about the regular menu so I didn't get to try half the things I saw online I wanted to try.  Messed up me and my buddies order like 5 times so I didn't even get what I ordered and apparently had rolls come out after I left that they charged me for.  Barely gave any ginger and wasabi.  Did not refill drinks.  Was mediocre at best but the chef looked new and wouldnt let us order off menu( only 2 other booths had customers and I've read reviews that say they do)  The squid was not even swallowable yet somehow I ordered 4 after the 1st when I have never even ordered more that 1 at any place. Not sure how, it was either cut wrong or spoiled but I had to drink half a cup of water to swallow(wasn't any wasabi left to bury in)  I plan to try again and definitely has potential based off of online menu so I'll give a 4 star for now."}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte and travel there for business now.  Finally there's a real Japanese restaurant with a real Japanese Chef, and not your run of the mill, I did it too, sushi restaurants.  The service was great along with the quality.  But the best thing about the restaurant was all the unique dishes they had.  Try the deep fried sushi roll - yes you heard me, deep fried sushi roll.  The rice is stick to your teeth good.  The Agedashi tofu is soft, sweet, and delicate.  My only complaint is that the portions were too big so we couldn't try more dishes."}
{"text":"Gone down hill! Umai used to be my favorite place to get sushi.  The last three visits I have been disappointed. The food is still good, but the portion sizes are smaller, the prices have gone way up, and service is horrible.  My last visit was a couple of weeks ago, the server didn't know the menu, I had to show her that what I wanted was on the menu, she came back to verify, another server came out to ask questions. Even with all that my order was wrong... And it was just a roll and 6 pieces of nigiri, not complicated at all!  Today I went for lunch, only to find out that they no longer offer the all you can eat sushi.  Service was again disappointing.  The place only had a few people dining at lunch time.  I won't be back. There are more places, with lower prices, and better service!"}
{"text":"What a great find to stumble upon. In the unassuming Quail Hallow shopping center, we decided to try Umai. On a quiet Monday night, this place was pretty empty. We were seated right away. Our waiter was wonderful, helpful, speedy and seemed like he genuinely enjoyed his job. The sushi was fresh with one spider roll and one tuna royale it was a great end to a Long MONDAY. We also snacked on some miso soup, shrimp tempura appetizer, dumplings and this delish fried mashed potatoes. I think our servers name was Justin! He deserves some serious props. Also I think we received our entire meal in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"The lunch special: $14, spring rolls, fried rice or white rice, and a crazy good selection of sushi rolls and nigiri...  So i asked the very nice server, Christian, how it worked and she said to order whatever quantity you wanted, up to 10 pieces...and i misunderstood this to mean 10 pieces at a time...but in reality, it was 10 rolls of 4 pieces each (as stated on the menu), so i ended up with 40 pieces....  and it was outstanding!!!  and they asked if i wanted more..i could barely move.  We were going to Rusans but they were INSANELY packed when i remembered Umai had opened...so glad Rusans was packed or i would not have had the chance to try this place.  I'll be returning as soon as my waistline lets me.    Just remember: 1 roll= 4 pieces, 1 piece nigiri=1 piece...  I am just amazed at how much better of an experience it is than the standard all you can eat buffet type thing...they encourage not wasting food, and they make it worthwhile to order what you want...so good.  i can't ramble enough about it.  Just so good."}
