{"text":"Awesome! Food is all made right in house. Atmosphere is nice.  Owner did an amazing job with this place.  Go check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"only been twice, dining in. standard pita gyro, the meat was tender, with just enough spring to make a delicious and savory bite. the hummus is house-made and it is very smooth, not grainy or oily. just perfect consistency. flatbread served hot, delicate, like a good pizza crust just chewy and crunchy enough.  wish i could add more menu items for this review, the tahini sauce was perfect. the staff (appears to be original, family owned, super friendly) treats you like family. it's a nice touch. one of the advantages of this intersection is there are several family owned businesses.. and i like to support them. ace hardware.. alyssia's... iowa cafe.. pita island. skip applebee's - hit this spot NOW!"}
{"text":"The food (at least the chicken pita) is fine, and my server was very nice and attentive, but I wasn't treated like a valued customer.  Came in with a coupon for 1/2 off a pita from LocalFlavor.com  The server had not seen this coupon so she asked the owner's wife who was sitting at a table in the restaurant with her baby (only other customer in the place).  She said they had not verified that coupon so they wouldn't honor it.  I was starving so I stayed and paid the full price, but I will never go back.  You should always choose a customer over $3."}
{"text":"Yum yum YUM! Looking for a great place to eat, you found it! Super fresh and delicious food, super cheep prices and incredible friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing food!!! I love that the menu is simple and they focus on being exceptional at what they do offer. Very fresh and interesting produce. Excellent service :)"}
{"text":"I was super impressed with this place! We were a party of 5 and we all raved about how good and fresh everything was! The waitress was extraordinary! My hats off to her and this business!"}
{"text":"Best greek food in the east valley. The chicken here is to die for. Whatever John uses to marinade gives his chicken incredible flavor and texture and it melts in your mouth. His cilantro hummus is perfection and the tzatsiki sauce is fresh, garlicky,  with shaved bits of cucumber and I've never had better. This place is 100% dedicated to its customer. John does all his own cooking and prep and it's only been open less than a year. A real winner and hidden gem."}
{"text":"The Manager who keeps commenting is very rude he thinks he can tell people how there experience was when people complain that's a way to help them improve he seems very arrogant in his dealings and that attitude alone would make me never want to go back I've been here once it was nothing special average gyros much better place up the street on power"}
{"text":"Best restaurant serving Middle Eastern food in this part of town.  We have frequently dined at Cafe Mix and at Bellagio's in the neighborhood. Of the two, we preferred Cafe Mix but decided to give this new restaurant a try.  We are so glad we did.  The restaurant has been almost empty the two times we've eaten there.  This worries me, because I wonder how the owner can stay in business with so few customers. He needs to do some serious marketing to get the neighborhood residents to become aware of the existence of this restaurant. Both times we visited we were alone or with only one other table occupied.  The food was excellent on both occasions. On the first trip, we had the hummus appetizer, a gyros pita roll, and something called a \"chicken steak\" pita roll. I learned that \"chicken steak\" is probably equivalent to plain seasoned grilled chicken breast--no idea where that term comes from. But it was delicious, tender, juicy, and plentiful. The rolls were served inside hot, grilled pita.  On the second visit, we had falafel pita, gyros meat on Greek salad, and beef skewers in pita. Again, all were fresh, delicious, good portions, and served by a nice waiter who came back to check on us a couple of times.  They had plenty of outdoor seating which might be pleasant now that the weather is starting to cool off. No waiter service--you order at the counter, get your own drinks, and they bring your food to the table when the order is ready. The restaurant appeared spotlessly clean.  We are delighted to have this restaurant in our neighborhood and hope that it will succeed. It's our new favorite Middle Eastern restaurant and we feel comfortable giving them our highest endorsement. It's better, in our opinion, than either Cafe Mix or Bellagio."}
{"text":"Wow!  Pita Island is fabulous!!!  I think the Chef is extraordinaire.  When my mother visited form PA we sat at Pita Island outside where she basked in the sun and me in the shade! By far the BEST Gyros, hummus, custard dessert.  I have visited several times after my initial visit.  I am thrilled Mike is right around the coupon serving the best gyros in Mesa.  Go Pita Island!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is always great and super fresh. I think what differentiates this place from the others is their pita bread is so fresh it's almost crispy.  The customer service is awesome as well I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I took the advise of others that rated this place and they were correct. The food here really is delicious. It is a little out of my way, but I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The cilantro jalapeno hummus was so fresh and tasty.  The Gyro, atmosphere and service was also great.  Over all value great. I recommend you try it. :)"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and we always love Mediterranean food.  Been here 3 times and everything is always perfect.  Vegetables are always crisp and fresh,  best gyro meat I have ever had.  This definitely will be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Food is good. The portions on the combo is small for the $14 price. Paid around $70 for 4 people. Gyro pizza was great. Good service and atmosphere. I encourage the owner not to be cheap and do something to make the restaurant smell better."}
{"text":"Besides the fresh and good food, the staff here at pita island are very welcoming. I have been to several Greek restaurants, and this one by far exceeds my expectations.  I ordered the grilled chicken pita with everything on it. Excellent food. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"It will change your life. Awesome gyros, awesome fries, awesome hummus (cilantro jalape√±o, yes please). Awesome people, great big open environment. Baklava is great, I dont have single bad thing to say here. Just great food."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I usually never looked pita places before until I tried The Pita island. The food was excellent the service is great, and the staff is awesome. I sent everyone I work with over to try this place because it's that good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere but the best part of Pita Island is the amazing staff they care about you and give great suggestions. I had never had a Pita before and was a little nervous trying one but this was some of the best food I have had. I would recommend any of my friends here and enjoy coming whenever I have a chance."}
{"text":"Pita Island is a gem hidden in a strip mall. The fresh hummus is delicious but even better is the home made pita - wow! This is not close to my home but I will certainly be making a special trip there often. Besides the typical Mediterranean fare they also serve brick oven pizza which is fresh and delicious. Try the gyro pizza and have the best of both worlds! And make sure  to have Mike entertain you with his jokes, very funny!"}
{"text":"I've been in to Pita Island a number of times now, and here are my observations:   This is a family-and-friends business. The owners are deeply passionate about the work they do and very clearly want to see their business succeed without compromising on quality. Not being in the restaurant business, I can only imagine how hard that can be! Every time I've been in, my server talks about how the items I order are made, the fresh ingredients used, and the careful prep work that went into it. And judging by the taste, I believe every word.   That being said, I do think Pita Island is still trying to narrow in on what will work for them in the long term. There have been some menu tweaks, for example, like recently making pasta and pizza available earlier in the day... and it seemed like they spent some time trying to decide on counter or table service for dine in customers (it hasn't always been totally clear)... But even through little changes like that, the quality of the food has been remarkably consistent.   There are a handful of established competitors nearby, and I've tried every one. I still go to some depending on what I want. For example, Pita Island doesn't serve Kabobs--so if I want a steak Kebab plate and some basmati rice for my Mediterranean fix, I gotta hit a different establishment.   However--Pita Island has my favorite Gyros hands down. The lamb is amazing, but the highlight is actually the pita. It is fluffy, slightly grilled/toasted, and their tzatziki is awesome. It is not an overcomplicated affair like at some other places. It's just high quality goodness, and I love it.   As an eggplant fan, I am also constantly seeking great babaganoush. The aforementioned nearby Kebab serving competitor (\"CM\")  does have babaganoush, which I got once and never got again. I recently tried Pita Island's, and it was soooo much better. The FRESHNESS of the eggplant was immediately apparent. It was really HOMEMADE and you could tell that right away. I wish they sold it in tubs that I could take home with me. Honestly, I make pretty good babaganoush--but their's is better. And a lot easier than making it myself. :)   Other gems:   - hummus (what can I say? It's consistently delicious.) - salad dressing (seems simple, but a greek restaurant's salad dressing has to be good!) - baklava (not too sweet, which means you can eat more!)  I have not tried the pizza or pasta there--really, when I go, it's because I want a Gyro. But I selfishly want this place to STAY OPEN and get as much business as possible! I will keep going back and trying other menu items I haven't hit yet. As they continue to develop a good reputation in the neighborhood, I think Pita Island will really establish itself. I hope so!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been in a few times. Someone has always been friendly and helpful. Sometimes the food just tastes better when you feel welcomed. The food has always been fresh and hot. Even my picky kids love it. This place is about as good as it gets for  Mediterranean type food. I'll continue to come back."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. It's phenomenal. Only other place I've tasted pizza like this is in Long Island, New York."}
{"text":"My wife and I are pizza snobs from Chicago. Our son invited us out for pizza at Pita Island. As a pizza snob I was sceptical but! we never say no to one of our kids offering to buy dinner. So we ordered 3 pizzas, Gyro, Veggie Chicken & Pepperoni. Man were we surprised. Absolutely delicious! Crust cooked perfectly. We also ordered hummus for an appetizer.They make their hummus fresh daily and the pita bread is made right there (still warm when served). Best we have ever had. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Gross. My instincts told me to keep driving when I pulled up. It's in a deserted strip mall. Unfortunately I went in and the same feeling to run came over me and like an idiot I stayed. The inside is way too big for the demand and smelled like mildew. I was greeted by a lady who acted overwhelmed...but only had two tables that already had their food. I ordered my food to go. Items were marked off their copy paper menu. I got the chicken pita. The chicken was dry and had a weird flavor and the pita bread was prepackaged. Unacceptable. Bread should be made from scratch. The sauce tasted like sour cream. Waste of time and money. Threw it out. The only positives of the experience is the guy who handed me the food, smiled and said thank you."}
{"text":"You know they say one can tell how good the food is by the number of cars in the parking lot, unfortunately only a few cars where in front of this establishment, so  don't believe the latter. I decided to gamble and I had the choice of many parking spaces, went in and ordered carry out. I was the only one in line and I despise lines but in this case I waited because my culinary instincts over came me. I was hungry.  I was greeted and offered a menu to decide my choices and was advised by the guy taking my order as to how good the food is.I selected a Gryo pita wrap,Baba Ghanoush,Grape leaves and Falafel, no it wasn't for a party, it was for me.  I was told that I would have a little wait because the food is made to order and I was in no hurry, take your time, I deserve it. I got home and began to plate my feast and my eyes told my stomach \"it's going to be good\" I like the truth. Everything was delicious and flavorful, the Gryo meat was moist and tasty along with the lettuce,tomato, onion and tzatziki which was folded in a warm piece of pita bread. The Falafel was made to order and I witnessed the chef cooking them, the order consisted six muffin shaped Falafels they were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Tahini sauce paired nicely, yummm.  Baba Ghanoush is grilled eggplant, tahini,and olive oil served with pita. Oh, you never had eggplant, well your tongue has over 10,000 taste buds so use them ! Delicious too. The stuffed grapes leaves were very good, grapes are good, so are the leaves that shade them from the sun.  I enjoyed every bite and I should have had a party because I had plenty. I wish I owned 100 vehicles to park in front of Pita Island to let everyone know how good it is."}
{"text":"Love this place! I got their Gyro and grilled chicken and my parents got their pizza! So amazing the pizza is made in the stone fire and its the best! I recommend this place to anyone looking for yummy Greek food!"}
{"text":"This place is in our neighborhood and will send out coupons from time to time. The gyro is very good, as well as the Greek salad. I prefer to take out, as dine in seems like you should order at the counter but they won't let you and you have to be served. Switch to counter service."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant every time I am in the neighborhood (about once a month). If I lived closer, I would eat here all the time! Not one thing I haven't like yet. Really love the cilantro jalapeno hummus!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now.   Good service, good food affordable pricing.    They just got their beer an wine license    I like local business and this place is Awesome  They also make a oven baked pizza old school style,  Nice"}
{"text":"Still love this place.  I have been here several times and the gyros are consistently good.  Service is quick and friendly.  The table next to me ordered the Greek fries and I will have to try them when I come back, they smelled amazing! They are also serving NY style pizza after 4pm, and hope to add beer and wine to their menu soon."}
{"text":"I've recently fallen in love with greek food so I decided to try my luck at this little cafe! From the moment I walked in I was given stellar service. The guy at the front counter was friendly and helpful when I couldn't narrow my options down. The chef who I believe to be the owner not only made hot, delicious and fresh food but was also very professional and friendly!   The food was fresh and made to order. I had a chicken gyro and the price was about $7 which I found to be reasonable. I'm not even a bread eater but I couldn't resist the homemade pita! I ate every bite. The restaurant was very clean and welcoming. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I have been here a few times and the food is always excellent. Fresh, hot and good. I get the grilled chicken pita. Don't care for the fries though- big, thick steak fries, but that is a personal preference so I just don't order them. Try it out- you will love it."}
{"text":"Their grilled Philly chicken pita is awesome! Nice place for a meal and one of our favorites. We've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Carrie was so sweet and prompt in service. John is the owner and chef and I have to say everything is perfect as it gets for Greek food in Mesa. They also just got their liquor license so you can even get a nice drink here too!! Give this place a shot!! Best baklava in town!!"}
{"text":"Service is great.  Food is fresh and tastes incredible.  Bought the gyro and it was outta this world.  This place is not close to my house but I'm coming back and so should you!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome ! Close to home! So glad we found this place! The staff are super friendly and attentive !! The food is scrumptious ! I always try to take my time eating so u can savor every bite but that doesn't last long because it's delicious ! The dining area is always clean! My fave is the gyro plate with Greek salad! The hummus and pita are awesome !!! Oh and tazeki!!!"}
{"text":"I have always luvd this type of food and sooooooo excited when it opened in our neighborhood. I've been there several times. ..always good and great customer service UNTIL tonight.  Called in my order,  went to pick it up to be told \"oops...I forgot to put ur order in\"  Really ?? You had 20 minutes to figure out what you messed up!  And. ..no discount,  complimentary gyro next visit..... .NOTHING ! I've been in customer service for half of my 50 years of life...this isn't close to acceptable for a new business or ANY business if you want to stick around .. Not like my $20 a month will make you close but we aren't coming back :("}
{"text":"Still excellent, still fantastic food, and still 5 stars.  I hope this restaurant survives as Mesa's food business is fragile and littered with places that used to be."}
{"text":"Place was a ghost town inside. Huge place and only two tables had anyone sitting at them.  The food was pretty good. I had a gyro pita and my wife had a chicken pita. The salad was okay for a side salad.  Both my wife and I got combos, one with fries, one with a side salad. I asked the waitress specifically if the combos came with a drink and she said no. On the way out I looked again at the menu and discovered that they do, in fact, come with a drink and that our combo price was more than if I had just ordered the pita and fries or salad separately. Too annoyed by the wait from the situation detailed below to get them to fix it.  I tried to use the Yelp check-in coupon; they couldn't figure out how to get it to work with their system so they gave me cash back instead of charging 10% less to the card.   Between the hassle and time getting the discount to work and the fact that I was overcharged means I am unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, clean and well kept restaurant.  The food was good.  I had the Gyros Plate with a Greek Salad on the side.  The plate was served with a humus, tsatsiki, warm pita and a plentiful helping of gyros meat.  The salad was fresh and the dressing was simple but good.  My only complaint was the olives used for a garnish were canned black olives.  They really should be using kalamata olives not these lame flavorless olives.  I wouldn't let that keep me from coming back.  The food definitely satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"would give 5 stars, but they will take it down since I don't review often. I got the gyro, jalapeno hummus and greek salad with chicken for my wife and I. Wonderful customer service and great food. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This is the message I received at 7:00pm last night from Mike the manager:   Hi Angie, Jan S. sent you a message on Yelp: Subject: Your Review \"Hi Angie, I'm messaging you, because of the review you left on our yelp page. The restaurant business is a really tough one and we wish every other business/restaurant the best luck and success. I really doubt what you wrote is true since we massage our seasoning into the fresh cut chicken breast evenly, and than prepare some for a final check. Our tzatziki sauce is made fresh with the best ingredients, and mixed well with professional cooking equipment. There could be a very rare possibility that either our fresh chicken itself, or the house made tzatziki sauce wasn't mixed properly, but both at the same time, sorry that's just not true and you know it. I know for sure that you are trying to help your friends business. What you don't know is that you are about to hurt their business significantly. WE DO NOT WANT TO HURT ANYONES BUSINESS, that's the last thing we want.  We are very disappointed by your review, because we take our food very serious.  You have a few options. We would like to offer you to come in, and have another (if you actually had one) grilled chicken pita on the house and tell us and yelp how you liked it. We really care about our customers, and please know that you are welcome any time smile emoticon ! ( Just say you're Angie who wrote the yelp review and you'll receive a free chicken pita meal/Combo)  If we see your review in the next few weeks unchanged, we will HEAVILY advertise in Cafe Mix's area until we get every single customer of them, and you know for sure that if they try our food once, they will never come back to cafe mix. We take this very seriously and we do not appreciate it. You successfully introduced us to this advertising option. Please take this seriously. Again we do not want to hurt anyones business especially Cafe Mix because they are our friends. By the way, If we are just around your corner from your work and cafe mix is even closer I do not believe that you know where we are located, and that you were actually here at Pita Island. The crossroads are Higley and Brown just for your information. Best regards, Mike - Pita Island Manager\""}
{"text":"The best!  Food is fast and made fresh every morning. Some of the best hummus and falafel I've had! Plus the owners/staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Just landed in Phoenix and we were starving.  Did a yelp search in the area and this comes up with 4.5 stars.  We get there at 11:30am and it doesn't look like its open.  I ask an employee (there were only two there) and he says that he forgot to turn the menu on.    I should start by saying that the guy was very nice.  I ordered a grilled chicken plate.  My wife ordered the taboulah salad but they were out.  We said that we've never seen a Greek restaurant without taboulah salad.  He said they didn't have any parsley.  Haha.  So my wife ordered what I ordered.    We sit down.  They bring out our Greek side salads.  They were huge and tasty.  Fresh ingredients.    After a while, they bring out my chicken plate and a gyro plate for my wife.  We explained that we ordered two chicken plates.  He looks confused and takes it back.  How do they mess up the order when we're the first two in their restaurant?  We were in a time crunch so we asked him to just refund the second plate.  We shared my dish and it was mediocre.  The chicken was dry and flavorless.  The hummus was good.  The tzaziki was tasty.    We waited around for the refund but the one-man counter was overwhelmed.  He was filling some drinks...which is on the other side of the restaurant.  Three different customers at the counter just waiting for him to come back.    Good portions.  Friendly (but painfully slow) service.  Chicken wasn't tasty.  The gyros looked good.   Won't return."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I are new to the area and she's been here twice and both times she's had exceptional service and fresh, delicious food!!!! They have fantastic customer service, they're super friendly and attentive. During the first time my fianc√© went, she went with her classmates and the waitress split their check 7 ways. She also made sure to put in their food order first so they could get back to class on time. I would highly recommend the cilantro jalape√±o hummus, their grilled chicken island plate and grilled chicken gyro. Their portions are huge and filling. This place does not disappoint. It has become our go-to place for delicious Mediterranean food for a great price!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday 3:30pm CLOSED! Not sure if they are in business anymore. Yelp said they were open until 4:00. Dove all the wY over here for nothing."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's close to home and work. I've been here at least 8 to 10 times now, sometimes dine in sometimes takeout. I've never had a bad anything from here. The gyro meat is awesome as well as the hummus and dolmades and baba ganoush. The restaurant is always spotlessly clean. I hope they keep the doors open for years to come."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Loved the server but food is tasteless and bland. I don't see the value for what you get."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, fast service, cool water foundation inside. I ordered the gyro, and delicious would be an understatement! 5/5 would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely wonderful experience here. The chicken pita wrap with salad and blackberry jasmine tea was amazing and the baklava was great, too! We live close by, so we'll definitely be coming more often. Very impressed! The service was also impeccable and you can tell they are very dedicated and enthusiastic about their business. We really enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town visiting, so we used Yelp to find a place for lunch. We both had the gyro island plate with salads, and it was delicious! I highly recommend for others to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Pita Island is the best food of all time - if pita island were a person I would vote for them for president. Whatever you're thinking about eating is a terrible idea, don't be dumb and come get Pita Island. It's totally worth it and the staff is both amazingly helpful and each and every one of them is fantastically good looking, like Greek statues."}
{"text":"Hummus and grape leaves are excellent. Falafels are made fresh in house. Great portions and yummy!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  The owners and staff are very friendly and nice.  I highly recommend for dine in or take out"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out so I can't say much about the service. But the cashier was very friendly and helpful with my questions. The food was very good - we ordered the gyro and the chicken pita. We also ordered an extra pita for our two-year old. I was expecting to just get a cold pita out of the bag, but they made sure it was cooked and nice and hot for her. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try Pita Island; it's super close to home and we really like to support local business.  The menu is a bit limited but it looks like that will be changing soon.  On our first visit we ordered a hummus starter and a couple of gyros (with fries). They were nice enough to let us get half traditional and half jalape√±o hummus. I can't decide which tasted better! The pita was delicious too. The gyro pitas were so good! The meat was thinly sliced, tender and wonderful. The fries were cooked perfectly. There was so much food, though. We were stuffed by the time we left! The service is friendly and fast. The dining area is very large, clean and welcoming.  We are looking forward to visiting often."}
{"text":"Sooooooo yummy!!!!! Can't wait to come back!!!!! The hummus was the best I've ever had my 3 year old ate most of it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most enthusiastic service I have ever received! Those who work there are passionate about their food and are proud to serve it to you which made me so excited to try it!   We ordered the falafels, hummus, and gyro, all delicious! The falafels were freshly made and came out piping hot with a perfectly made tahini sauce.  The hummus was also freshly made and served with homemade pita bread.  I don't eat meat so I can't speak for my husbands gyro, but he nearly inhaled it!    Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food is healthy and delicious. Staff is fast and friendly. We love coming here. My favorites are the chicken/gyro fatoush salad."}
{"text":"Really delicious! I must have driven passed this place a million times before we finally decided to stop. It was super slow, and the employees were super friendly. We ordered a Philly Pita and a Gyro Pita with a side of falafel.  Usually, I am not a fan of falafel, but this was crispy and flavorful served with a side of hummus. The pitas were generously sized (quite frankly, more than I could eat!)  The servers were super excited to help out and very friendly....I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Their gyros are amazing. Hummus is great the jalape√±o cilantro one is really good. Baklava is really good...but their island dessert...OMG!!! So yummy!!'  Definitely a great lunch place."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and just always disappointed. The meat has no flavor, tzatziki sauce is bland and the frys are always soggy, even when I get them in the shop. There are better places within a stone throw, I'll be going to other places."}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday, and have to say....I was impressed! I ordered the chicken pita, and it was so delicious. I would have ordered more of the greek sauce if i would have known how good it was! My only complaint was that my order for two pitas and french fries took about 15 minutes. Kind of a long time to wait while trying to keep your toddler out of their un-fenced water feature in the middle of restaurant. But, I will go back regardless :)"}
{"text":"One of the better Gyro's in town. It took a long time to get our food and we were one of the only ones in there. The chicken gyro is ok but the lamb gyro was VERY good!!"}
{"text":"Great Gyros and Chicken Kebab! We have found our new pita place. So happy to support local, small businesses."}
{"text":"Being a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food fanatic for many years, I finally decided to stop in and try Pita Island after driving by their restaurant several times.  I was definitely not disappointed. I was first greeted by one of their very friendly staff, Mike. I finally decided on ordering the gyro pita combo and I was not disappointed as the food tasted great and was served nice and hot. I also had a chance to meet the owner, John. He was very friendly as well and both he and Mike and their staff are committed to satisfying their customers and it shows in the quality of their home made dishes as well as their attitudes."}
