{"text":"They where playing Queen... Need I say more... 

This place is on point. I got the Beeeeff buger and it was great. A lot of good looking people and vibe of La Belle & La Boeuf makes this a must visit if you're in your 20s.

The only downside was, I was waiting long time for my bill, but the music made it OK."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for casual chillout nights. It was crowded everytime we came. The food was great. We ordered chicken wings, classic burger with a cocktail. The service is great. It is a wonderful place to chillout on a hot summer day. Since the restaurant is quite popular, I highly recommend to make the reservation at least 48h before, and still come 10min in advance to make sure to be seated on time. The price is among the cheapest ones in Centropolis. Expect between 40 to 50$ for two people."}
{"text":"Yummy, greasy food. Try their pulled pork poutine or one of their crazy burgers. Drinks are creatively served in mason jars, their white sangria is perfect for summer.  Decor and furniture are interesting, but their vegan menu is limited."}
{"text":"Judging by the other reviews posted here, I'm not sure we ate at the same place. Either they've had a huge overhaul in terms of staff, or it must've been an off night for the two times I went. Both times my group and I were seated outdoors on the terrasse. Service was exceptionally slow, considering there were not more than 2 small groups. Staff stayed indoors for most of the evening and watched television. 

As for the food itself, it's nothing great. Wasn't at all impressed with their burgers."}
{"text":"Very good turkey burger! The kool-aid pickles are interesting to say the least, but are actually quite good. 
We also had BBQ chicken wings to start which were very very good. 
Our waitress was very nice and funny, but seemed a little out of it at times.
Very nice restaurant but somewhat loud (acoustics aren't great and the music was sometimes distracting). 
My one critique of the menu would be its lack of vegetarian/vegan options, but considering it's called Beauty and the BEEF, a part of me thinks one veggie burger suffices."}
{"text":"First of all, love the name of this place! Huge cocktail selection and a good food menu. Outdoor terrace seating is great for some added people watching haha."}
{"text":"Really good option if you're looking for a restaurant to hang out with friends. Really nice drinks and cocktails. Food is delicious with generous portions. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I crave burgers when I'm very hungry, and this place has decent burgers. But the service is so slow that it often makes me hangry...oh and also good beer and cocktail selections and good veggie burger. But so slow..."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and service a bit slow in waiting for food, but the waitress was super chill. Disclaimer: the check in bonus shooter added about half a star to this place. Definitely coming back, I've been here many times before writing this review. Did I mention a terrasse. Yes I'm a bit drunk. My 2 cents"}
{"text":"Love love love this place !! The owner Antonio and Marco were one of the best people I've met on my visit to Montreal. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. I would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for a fun, easy-going environment where you can have fun with a burger order. Not to mention their grilled cheeses are unreal. One down side is that the side salad has never been a favourite of mine but that's my own fault for ordering a side salad at a place that specializes in poutine. Meal salads are fantastic however. I would recommend this spot to anyone who wants to spend 1-2 hours at a spot with friends and enjoy a great burger & poutine."}
{"text":"The burgers here are alright, my boyfriend and I have been here before. The first time I came here, we ordered the Mac and Cheese bun burger (brain fart on the actual name) but it was fantastic and great for those M&C lovers out there or anyone who wants to try something new. This time around, we tried the OMG burger with a side of classic Poutine and Mac and Cheese. Mmm, it was a great meal. The service was overall okay. Don't expect to be amazed, just good food and a nice old school throwback atmosphere, style and 90's music. (-:0"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I came here with a group of 5 people. When we arrived, we were completely ignored by the staff who were busy watching TV. Eventually we seated ourselves and a waiter grudgingly came around to take our order. I asked for a salad instead of fries and the waiter simply shook his head and said NO. The waiter tried to pester me to order drinks no less than 3 times. The food was mediocre, just standard burger fare, def not worth the premium prices they charge. Eventually we got the bill and I was surprised to see a 20% surcharge--on the menu it said there was a mandatory charge for parties of 8 or more, but we were only 5... I argued with the server, who insisted that because we sat at a table for 8, we had to pay. Since we were forced to pay extra, I didn't leave a tip. The waiter snarled first in French then English \"Tip is not included!\" 
Overall we were made to feel unwelcome by the staff. We will def never come back!!"}
{"text":"Was amazing, beef was so good I was upset it was so big and hard to eat they should have female burgers so girls can finish it lol over all drinks and food A++ I want to go back and try something else ASAP"}
{"text":"This place is really different in a refreshing kind of way! You get to reminisce and eat a delicious burger!"}
{"text":"Overrated restaurant, food is not that good but the service is really nice and good. I had my food in less than 18 minutes which is pretty great! but I've had a lot of drinks there and the pot masson are disappointing."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff , food is fresh and consistently good. Amazing drinks menu the bartenders really know what they are doing here. The burgers are on point fries are delicious , make sure to try the cool aid pickles and there home made chips with spicy mayo!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger restaurants in Montreal next to burger bar on crescent. 

The first time I went to this location was for a surprise party for my birthday and although it was my first time going to this location it was my second time going to the chain (first time I went to the chain was the one in laval in which I was extremely impressed with) although the food as usual was spectacular, where this restaurant falls flat compared to laval is the service. My girlfriend had booked one large table for all of us and when we arrived we were given 3 booths because of an apparent error in our reservation, on top of this problem the service was really slow and poor and the waitress hardly understood English which I usually don't mind at all but in downtown Montreal in a very touristy area where I had friends from out of town who couldn't speak French and I had to order for them it kind of bothered me. 

Apart from the service the big positive is of course the food and the bar. I was overly impressed with the quality of the beef as well as the quality and freshness of the toppings. On top of that the drink menu is phenomenal with a lot of selection as well as a good selection of quality local and domestic beers. The only complaint I would have is the bloody ceasar they serve might be a little too spicy for some people (although I like it that way)

To sum everything up I would give the a solid 3/5 because of the food, but many improvements can be made with the quality of service offered here especially at the price you pay."}
{"text":"This is one place you really get your money's worth! The portions match the prices almost perfectly (drinks a tad over priced for size). What's great about this place is that the breads (or lettuce wrap) and sides are to the customers choosing. So, if you want a side order of mashed potatoes (RECOMMENDED) instead of fries with your burger, you can have exactly that! 

Their beef burgers are simply heaven but I like that they have a great selection of (non-beef) burgers too! The turkey and cod burger are heavenly as well. Their breads are fresh and toasted just right. The ambiance in the Anjou location is friendly, vibrant & perfect for parties."}
{"text":"Not just another gourmet burger joint!

The place is huge, just opened few weeks ago. I walk by every week on my way home from work and the name is catchy so I decided come and try it out.

This place is fun! There's always something going, they these themes every night, and the menu has something for everyone. There are so many things I wanna try I definitely have to come back.

The drinks menu is quite extensive too. They have this one page with large mason jar drinks they are huge and have 4oz of alcohol in it, even with the 16$ price I was tempted to order one.

We ordered the Elvis gratton burger, which has peanut butter, bacon and bananas. I know it sounds crazy right?, but the peanut was more of a light peanut sauce. It was really tasty, surprisingly! And that my friend is amazing.

I wanna go back with a big group so I can order a whole bunch of things like wings and fried pickles and all the other fun stuff on the menu.

Forget the belle give me the beef! Lol"}
{"text":"Horrible place to go with friends and try to have a conversation. The staff pumps the music so loud to the point where you can't even hear yourself think. Food was good, but I will not return because of the extremely loud music. I'll go to a night club for loud music not a restaurant."}
{"text":"A new favorite!  Super burgers, nice and juicy.  Great atmosphere, excellent music, pretty eclectic menu. Big portions and a great bar selection.  Vraiment tres bien.  J'y retournerai pour sur.  Prix raisonables.  

Note:  18+!  So a good reason to ditch the kids...  Man, I wish they would open one in the West Island, we are in desparate need of good restaurants/bars!!!!"}
{"text":"I was a guest in Montreal from Toronto. My buddy who lives in Montreal took me there. they have great food. very tasty. great patio, great interior design. this restaurant is very unique in its style although the bill total can get higher than an average patio/burger place which is not unusual given the location of the restaurant and the quality of the food.
their serving portions are huge. my wife asked for small poutine and she could not finish hers half-way. the waiters are cool, casual and super nice."}
{"text":"Bbq pork grilled cheese was really tasty and good. 4oz cocktail might be a little expansive considering how much ice there is, but they taste really good !"}
{"text":"When we entered we were told to wait at the door but were given a place immediately. We had a waitress check up on us periodically to take our order. They took a decent amount of time around 20 minutes to prepare our order, but what we discovered is that it was completely worth the wait. Two generously sized burgers were served with a side of french fries and tap water. It was love at first bite. The meat is high quality and so are the fries and they throw in a delicious red pickle with the plate. 

Though a little pricey and takes some time, we found the food to be very filling and absolutely worth it, and the place is colourful and vibrant."}
{"text":"BEST Burger in LAVAL.

Amazing burger, cool drinks, fast service and good ambiance.

What els do u need?"}
{"text":"Second time at belle et boeuf in as many years. The first time was good (and expensive), this time was awful.

Let's start: we were here for a friend's bday, so they packed the tables as to the point where we had no elbow room. My SO orders a drink, tries it, and doesn't like. We tell the waiter immediately. Politely, asking for a change. He looks at us like we're crazy, and says no, it's policy.

Alright, off to a good start. Our food comes. The fries are cold. Koolaid pickle is fun, burger is average and over priced. My SO Mac n cheese was actually tasty but again cold, we tell the waiter. He offers to put it in the microwave... Right. In all I had two drinks, my SO had one (paid for 2) got a good buzz, but the service was awful, the food was average and we spent $110 all in (imagine the tip)

Not only will I not be going back, I'll go out of my way to tell others how awful. There are lots of average bars and resto's in centropolis, might as well go to an other with better service and warm food"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant . I guess I expected better . Food was awful . Totally ordered a little of everything that I had read reviews on . Staff was to top it off rude .+*** Whoever the owner or owners are they should be ashamed !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just another overrated. overpriced, gimmicky burger joint. The burger was quite edible but the potatoes left a lot to be desired, as well as the cole slaw. If you can't get the basics right...why  bother? 

Not a bad experience, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cool cool cool place! It just brings back vitality to the old downtown building. We came there as a group of 4, each one of us enjoyed our burgers and drinks ,especially the cocktails ,very inspiring. I had la belle burger which had such huge and juicy beef loaf inside along with a bunch of my favorite vege arugula. And they could even serve the fresh lettuce instead of the burger bread by request ,earned another star for girls who do not eat carbs.
For the deco and the ambiance inside of Lblb ,just as good as we expected,the server were cute as well, go explore yourself!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the service is horrible. Waited 30 minutes for a waitress to even take our order. We had to ask other waitresses where ours was because she hadn't come over for drinks or even to say hello. After ordering the food took 45 minutes to come out of the kitchen. When we asked for a side of mayo and more water she took 15 more minutes to bring that. It looked like it was just our waitress, maybe she should look for other work, seems too complicated for her."}
{"text":"Decided to come here on our last night in Montreal for a drink. We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely unfriendly and quite rude. This was very contrary to all experiences we had thus far during our visit. He pretty much just grunted and threw some menus in front of us. We ordered our 2 drinks and checked in on yelp which gave us 2 free shots of a liquor of our choice. When we showed the bartender he just nodded and poured a shot of jameson which is not at all what we would have requested. Definitely would not try this place again based on the crummy service. If your service isn't good I dont care what your food tastes like it ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"La belle et la boeuf doit être l'un de mes restaurant préféré de Laval! Pour commencer, l'ambiance est excellante si vous aimez le style retro-rock avec de la bonne musique bien forte. Les barmen sont très agréable et prenne la peine de discuter avec vous si vous y on le temps pour! Aujourd'hui c'étais la quatrièmes fois que j'y retournais et les burgers sont toujours aussi bons les uns que les autres! Un bon drink en pot Masson (village people best drink ever) et une bonne bouffe, y'a rien de mieux pour accompagner un samedi soir! Je recommanderais toujours cette endroit au gens qui cherche à essayer un nouveau resto dans le coin de Laval. Long vie à la Belle et la Boeuf!"}
{"text":"After visiting this unusual place , you won't feel except satisfied : my friend had the called 'heart attack burger'  which is huge with very tasty salad and fries and I had the veggie burger which was really amazing tasting excellent not to mention their  drinks put in jars with real fruits inside , very original and colorful  experience which gives a feeling of living in the sixties , very exceptional and tasty  bravo!"}
{"text":"An okay restaurant, but wouldn't be a place I would \"crave\" going to again. My friend and I went on a Friday, so I definitely was expecting it to be busy. They don't take reservations for 2 people, so when I got there, they take your name down and call you when a table is ready. It would have been a 15-20 minute wait. My friend was late, and they don't let you sit until the full party is there, so I had to wait for 30. Not necessarily their fault. 

We ordered their mason jar drinks, and mine was really yummy (the Janis Joplin). Onto the food. I know it's a burger place, but I was craving fish that night, and decided to try their cod fish sandwich, with sweet potato fries. I also asked for avocado, which was an extra. I liked that they had a ton of dipping options (spicy mayo, garlic mayo, honey mayo). The sweet potato fries were delicious; however the cod fish sandwich was really not that good. The piece of fish was so thick, that the taste was lacking. No flavor at all. I was glad to have asked for avocado, because it helped a bit, but I ended up eating maybe a 1/4 of my sandwich. They also needed our table at 9:30, and offered to move us to another table, but we were pretty much ready to leave anyway. The service was a little slow, but understandable for a busy Friday night. I will say they had an awesome music selection, and the decor was unique. It won't be the first burger place I'd think of, when craving one, but I definitely see the appeal for a night out with friends/being right near Guy-Concordia."}
{"text":"I went to La Belle et la Boeuf based on a referral from a friend. Even if I was warned that the burgers are big, dude I was amazed. They even have the concept of the huge burger that if you eat it all, you will have your picture posted on their entrance wall. They had drinks coming in HUGE jar.
Great concept.
Loved my burger and poutine.
BTW, they have like 20 kinds of poutines!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a poutine & beer lunch on a recent visit to Montreal.  We had the classic poutine and it was delicious.  My girlfriend had never had it before.  If I had taken a picture of her face when she first tried it, that would have been review enough.  Definitely worth a return visit.  Having had the classic poutine, I am now very curious about the many variations on the menu.

I would also add, nice casual pubby vibe and fun decor."}
{"text":"I'm not a big \"let's eat at a restaurant\" type a person but I'll go in a group setting for special events or just take out. Went on a Friday night & it was a packed house. Good thing our planner made reservations. The music in the place is at full blast so yelling is a must if you want to speak to the person next to you. The look of the place was kind of like a sports bar with several TVs situated around the place. The back of the bar decorated with a wall of booze which perked me up right away. A little tight on space but most restaurants are like that anyways. Good mix of guys & gals in the crowd for people watching.
                  Pretty big menu of heart stopping goodness mainly featuring burger, poutine, fries & mac & cheese combos. Not too vege-friendly although they do have a couple of options. Lots of drinks to be had with beer (bottle or tap), hard liquor, mix drinks & wines. The menu is pretty pricey so if your looking for cheap eats, this place is not for you.
                  Service was pretty good took a while to get our food but the place was busy that night & our party took a long while to order as we waited for everyone to arrive. Would go again just to try out that \"Epic\" burger which almost costs $50 & see if I can wrap part of my mouth on it. 
                  Plus side, located at the Faubourg which is great to see some interesting businesses move in there since it's been in a state of decline for about two decades."}
{"text":"Cest un burger bar, pas un steak house. Bon choix de Mayo pour accompagner les frites. Belle ambiance. Le choix des drinks en pot Masson est super. Presqu'aucun choix de dessert par contre."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time this week. I tried two poutines (the pulled pork and the smoked meat) - both were fantastic. The go gos were delicious - reminded me of my youth. Atmosphere was great. I would stop by again."}
{"text":"Bon drink . Bouffe spécialement grasse mais tu vas la pour ça. Service moyen par contre."}
{"text":"I had the poutine with bacon, onions, and chorizo. Food was delicious and came out quickly. The mojito I ordered was probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Decent burger with tons of mushrooms. Huge drink menu. Bill can get pricey."}
{"text":"Definitely not the place to go without an appetite! The food is junk food at its finest served in big greasy portions...and it's pretty delicious. 

The entrees are pretty generous - we split the mini cheeseburgers (3) which weren't that mini and the pogos which I would definitely recommend. 

The burgers are huge with pretty creative fillings and a great option for when you can't decide what to order on their very full menu. 

I had the pulled pork grilled cheese this time which comes with a huge bowl of really good fries and wasn't disappointed.

Drink menu is pretty extensive and complete with mason jar drinks - I'm a big fan of their different sangrias and have yet to try one that I didn't enjoy. 

Service was friendly and efficient... Waitresses were friendly and made small talk as they came by."}
{"text":"Amazingly good food, amazing staff. Drink menu is nothing you've seen before. Love the John Lemon mason jar! Owner came over to introduce himself, and made a feel very welcome. Great decor, atmosphere and music. Glad we stopped in! Will be back for sure when were back in the area. Thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"Really, really good experience. Came for lunch and was NOT disappointed. Just a bit of perspective as well, my wife is not a fan of burgers but she not only liked hers, she said she would be happy to come back. Great friendly service, great food and honestly reasonably priced for what we received. 
I highly recommend the place. Bit kitchy on the decor side."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends about maybe a week ago to have a birthday supper. I have to say it was an amazing experience! Great ambiance, great food and amazing drinks this a must in my book. Planning an evening out this week and they are high on my list of places to consider!"}
{"text":"I had a burger and a mason jar drink. The drink special from 5-7 is certainly worth it as the cocktails are unique and delicious. They have plenty of alcohol and some really original mixtures/names. Think La Distillerie but with more of a \"bro\" vibe. The reason I didn't give this place a higher rating was our extremely rude server. Throughout the meal I tried to get some service but I guess the layout of the place makes it difficult for servers to see you so a bus boy had to refill our glasses and do most of the work. When we finally flagged him down to get the cheque and paid, he had the nerve to follow me and ask me for a larger tip. I had already tipped him using the machine but I guess he felt that I didn't tip enough. I would understand this if I hadn't tipped at all but for him to ask for more money just felt like a slap in the face. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Waiting system is terrible, hostess said it wouldn't be long, waited over an hour for a table for 2 - I prefer being told if the wait is unreasonably long instead of being lied to. Very unorganized and crowded with people pushing and shoving to get on the list instead of the hostess going to get names.  Felt like I was trying to get into a club not a restaurant. Food was average, I got a lettuce wrap burger which was more like a head of lettuce thrown on a plate. Fries were all small ends and the fig jam on my husband's burger was gross. Drinks were these monstrous glasses filled with ice so within minutes of all that melting you get a nice watered down version of your drink. Trying to make it fancy looking but forgetting about taste. Definitely not worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Knowing this place is pretty popular I decided to be proactive and make a reservation for me and my friend for a Saturday night. I called a week ahead and was told they only make reservations for groups of 5 or more. The girl on the phone said to come at 6 or I would be waiting minimum 30min. So let me make a reservation to avoid all the waiting!!! We still decided to try it out hearing all the good things. We arrived at 8 and had to wait 45min for a table. I already wasn't impressed by the lack of attention from the greeter at the door. Stood about 5 min in front of her before I had to speak up instead of her acknowledging me. We had to sit at the side bar facing the drafty window with uncomfortable hard stools or wait another unknown amount of time for a table. 
I was really unhappy with seeing a group of 3 get escorted to a reserved table. I asked the girl at door how they had a reservation when it's supposed to be for 5 or more, she shrugged and said someone probably didn't show up. So by that reasoning I should just lie and say I'm 5 people just to get a reservation....

Service was very slow. I only saw about 3 waitresses for the whole resto, should have more on a packed night. Our waitress was nice and checked up on us. Drink was ok, had a sangria which wasn't very cold but tasty and sweet to my liking. I choose the pulled pork burger with onion rings. Meat-delicious but bun was not great. Coleslaw was tasty, not too creamy or acidic. Koolaid pickle is overrated-tasted like a regular pickle just dyed red. Decently priced, 1 glass sangria with pulled pork burger and onion rings cost 25$ with tax

Overall it wasn't a great experience especially for the wait time. I would go back during the middle of the week but def not weekend again. It's good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great decor, music and vibe in this place. Food was good too! Had the chicken burger on a whole wheat bun and it was quite good, as were the coleslaw and fries. Buddy had a cheeseburger, which he liked too! Waitresses were gorgeous too, which didn't hurt!"}
{"text":"La préposée à l'accueil nous fait asseoir dans une banquette dont elle savait qu'il y avait un renversement de liquide précédemment.  Quand on a demandé d'avoir une autre place, les fesses mouillées, d'aucune excuse, dit que ça été nettoyé au préalable et visiblement irritée, elle nous assigne une nouvelle place.  La serveuse plus amicale, vient sauver les meubles. Nourriture ordinaire, portion de viande généreuse, mais combien cher payé pour un souper de burger.  Dommage pour une première expérience décevante. Un souper presque parfait."}
{"text":"I've been here twice; the first time was bad and the second time was good. The first time I order the Pac Mac burger which is supposed to be a fried mac and cheese type burger. It turns out that they literally fry up 2 big bun shaped pieces of mac and cheese and use that as the buns with a piece of meat in between it. It was way too greasy and sort of gross tasting, I couldn't finish it and vowed not to come back. 
The second time was a few days ago, it was my girlfriend and her twin's birthday and her family wanted to go celebrate it by eating here. I was a bit turned off by it since I didn't enjoy my first experience but was hopeful that it would be better and thankfully I was right. I tried the Classic Bacon and Cheese burger and was floored by how yummy it was. The cheese was strong, the meat was extremely juicy and flavorful and the buns kept everything together. Not to mention the fries were great too. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Kool-Aid pickle, the taste of it just turned me off. My girlfriend had the Captain Flan(?) burger and really enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Très bon hamburger avec le pain sans gluten et les frites de patate douce!! Le service est un peu long, mais les employés très agréable! Par contre la musique est un peu forte! Le prix est plutôt raisonnable pour la qualité et la quantité! 
Je le recommande!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service but it was beyond noisy and it was not even the ppl talking but the music!
If you want to eat a good burger but don't care what your friend at the other side of the table has to say then you have found THE PLACE."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the waitstaff was extremely friendly.  The biggest problem was deciding what to get as there were far too many choices.  I also really enjoyed the ambience and I can't forget about the cocktails which were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Been there once the food was ok nothing crazy ...super loud rock music inside where u can't hear ur partner ..."}
{"text":"Visited again last night and it just seems to get a little more disappointing each time.  The music was so loud that we were literally screaming at the waitress and she still couldn't hear us.  We had to point at the menu to tell her what we wanted.  Don't get me wrong, I love the music selection, but I also like to be able to have a conversation.  

I ordered the Californian which is mainly chicken and avocado and it was disappointing.  The chicken was hard ans dry.  I understand this place specializes in burgers but if they have other offerings they should put a little more effort into making them good as well.  I'm keeping them at three stars because I have had other experiences here that were much better."}
{"text":"Classic bar and grill.  The burgers were delicious.  Their bar back is a lovely play of light, glass and liquor.  Yep, it is loud, but very clean and cared for.  Eat a great burger with crispy fries while watching the game."}
{"text":"We went to La Belle et La Boeuf at Guy Concordia to try their much awaited lunch menu.

We had:
- 9.95$ Lunch deal which included a vegetable soup and the Burger of the day which was topped with Smoked Meat, Mustard, Dill Pickles and Tomatoes 
- La Belle Burger which was topped with Fig Jam, Brie and Roquette 
- Strawberry or Vanilla or Chocolate Milkshakes on the house! (Pick Jizztastic Vanilla)

{"text":"Came here the first time for Burger week last year for the PAC man burger. So far the best burger ever, I'd you don't mind the calories. Instead of bread as buns, it's deep fried Mac and cheese. OMG. Theu also have cute and delicious cocktails served in Mason Jars. Friday and Saturday nights are super busy. The service is a bit on the slow side, but worth it for that burger."}
{"text":"I love this place. Sit on the patio on a warm sunny day and you're guaranteed to see a lot of hot girls walk by.

The drinks are pretty good. It's tough to find a good mojito outside of Cuba but this place manages to make good ones. They put 4 oz of rum in the standard mug so be careful lol.

The food is also good. I usually have a poutine and some hot wings. The wings are very big so an order of 6 wings will be enough for most normal humans.

It's a place I go to on a regular basis so it's definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Love the food!  This place has great dishes and comfort food.  The servers are very friendly and the atmosphere is quite fun.  My only complaint is it can get loud in the evenings and especially during game season, but that's great for them! I'm glad they get busy."}
{"text":"Popular on a Monday night. Nice outside seating with late afternoon sun. This  Canadian burger joint serves true whoppers- and that goes for the drinks as well. Served inMason jars.... 

Went for the craziest one- \"Le Couchon\"- a big burger wrapped bacon, deep fried served with cheddar, peanut butter, and orange onion Marmalade. Sounds crazy right? Actually works! 

Good Caesar salad- if served somewhat awkwardly in the fried bowl ? Drink was awesome - but they shove a ton of ice in that mason jar. 

Service just ok, but friendly."}
{"text":"Sarah, our waitress was so awesome! Friendly, smiling, gave suggestions and was so honest and patient with us as we struggled to make a decision on what to get. The food choices and drink choices are so refreshingly overwhelming, and our food was so good. This is a place that I want to bring a whole bunch of friends to. I have to admit that I never expected to ever see some of the pairing that they do. Case in point, peanut butter in a burger!"}
{"text":"Spent the night in Montreal and decided to have dinner here and I was not disappointed with the food!

I had the pulled pork and onion poutine and the deep fried Kool Aid pickles. The pickles were very good (just tasted like regular deep fried pickles with a little kick to them), but the poutine was incredible!
My girlfriend had the chicken, bacon, and frito mac n cheese and it was some of the best mac n cheese I've had. 

I also had an absinthe mixed drink and it was really good as well. 

The only problem we really has was with the service. After we had finished eating, it took us 15 minutes to get a box for our leftovers and another 15 minutes after that to get our bill. 

Would have rated it lower but the food was so good.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"When The Belle & LA Boeuf first opened in Laval, I was quite impressed, there burgers simply put were spectacular. Well that was then and this is now, and I think popularity and success went straight to there heads because now they just serve sub standard food. The restaurant has numerous varieties of poutine and grill cheese, but I don't care about those items, I'm a burger guy and now there burgers stink. Meat that does not seem fresh, its just a soggy piece of meat with a lot of garnish on top, meat that is cold. The star of the plate on a burger is the meat and this restaurant just doesn't cut it anymore. Their are numerous burger joints in this city and if the belle & la boeuf don't watch out, they will eventually be a memory. You foodies want a burger experience, go to burger bar or burger royal. This restaurant is getting two stars for the sole reason that my mojito was good."}
{"text":"I CRY EVERYTIME I EAT THERE. seriously, the food is magical. the place is beautifuly decorated. the staff is nice and pretty. kinda crowded sometimes but otherwise YES AGAIN."}
{"text":"Hey. Juste pour vous dire que y'a du monde en titi au Centropolis le vendredi soir. Genre, oublie ça si tu as pas de réservation. Surtout dans le rond-point.

This being said - On a essayé de rentrer manger à La Belle et la Buf à 20h45 et y'avait juste rien à faire, ça refoulait par dehors. Heureusement, nous avions une réservation pour un groupe à 22h pour faire le party. On est allés manger ailleurs en attendant.

De retour à 22h, on nous assigne une rangée de tables au fond du bar, près des toilettes. Vers 22h30 on nous fait sentir que si tout le monde n'arrive pas bientôt ils vont donner la place à d'autres personnes. Par contre, on nous avait promis les tables dans la section bar, les tables hautes ou tout le monde peut discuter ensemble (c'était le party de fête à une fille). Après avoir vraiment insisté pour qu'on nous donne les places promises (et réservées...), on nous bouge vers une petite table haute (on est 30 personnes) dans la section bar. A force de faire nos rapaces on a réussi à en dégoter une autre. Bof hein..

Les drinks étaient bons, la bouffe cochonne. Rien de mémorable, c'était vraiment à veille de devenir une mauvaise expérience."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a complete dive but don't be fooled, it's actually very cool. Inside it's huge and blasts all sorts of top 40 music mixed from the early 2000s. The food is surprisingly really good. Like the burgers...they're MASSIVE...and an order of pouring can feed four people. 

Check out their drink menu, they have all sorts of funky creations. I had the mango sangria and it was so good my friend ordered it as his as his second drink because after sipping mine he was sold. 

The service is a little off. The staff is really nice but we had to wait a while for our drinks. Our food came first, and drinks followed a while later so that was a bit backwards."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Being American and only speaking English, I had zero problems ordering and understanding the bartender. The Poutine Big Bird was delicious and large enough for me to not finish, hahaha."}
{"text":"Drove by and seen this place many time but never really stop by before last week. Went there for a friend's birthday and it was pretty cool. It was so nice out and the place was packed.

Best service ever...the waitress we had was AMAZING!!!

We were there for happy hours so all the drinks are on special so we had drinks from a mason jar and must admit very delicious and lots of choices too. Drink menu is big do I will go back to try more very soon. Food menu is big as well so will definitely go back to try more.

The food was pretty good and the portions huge. We tried the beer battered onion rings. Nit the best I had before but pretty solid. The fried cool-aid pickles those were truly amazing and they come with some spicy mayo (must have 100%). Main course I took grilled chicken burger wrapped in lettuce. The thing is they put too much lettuce and they actually don't wrap it properly so you end up with a big mess, waste pretty all the lettuce and it's also very hard to eat. Next time I will pick another option for sure.

Was too full for desert so we did not try any but maybe next time.

This is a great place to go with friends and have a good time. Nice retro scene but the music might be a bit too loud so if you don't like loud music or you are looking for a quiet date this will not be the right place."}
{"text":"I had reservations coming in the restaurant - I'm not much of a fan of restaurants that base their appeal on shock values. Huge hamburgers, combinations that clog arteries just by looking at the menu, that kind of place...

Went for lunch with a friend. We had a beer (decent selection - could use a little bit more choices considering the number of local microbreweries that are accessible in quebec) and I had the turkey burger while my friend had the King Kong grilled cheese. My burger was very tasty, a bit on the \"too big\" side but still manageable. The grilled cheese on the other hand fell into the \"humongous\" section - not easy to eat to start with due to the size of it (what good is combining these items if you still have to split them apart to actually eat them) and the size of the patties are simply too big. Food was tasty - nothing to complain about there.

Basically - the size is just too big, which leads in wasted food and money. The menu could use a little bit more selection on some items (more salads as main meals, or even as a side choice (if it is available, it wasn't offered to us)) and the burgers should be offered in two sizes of patties."}
{"text":"When walked in place seemed nice good tunes, lots of women. Asked to sit outside was out in the main path, when asked to move \" this is all that's available\" lots of empty tables. Went to bar it was nice. Took over 10 minuets to get served should have left. The bartenders were more into the group of 4 women and doing shots with them. Took 15 minuets to get my check, then could not operate the cc unit."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. I've been multiple times and it's always been a pleasure. They have a vast selection of drinks, burgers, poutines, grilled cheese and some other items. 

Pros: Their drinks and speed rail are both potent. If you order a rum and coke, you will very much taste the rum. The food is excellent and served in large portions. My favorites are the grilled cheese, particularly the 'Montreal' grilled cheese with Smoked Meat and tomato dipping sauce to go with it. 

Con: There are only 2 flavors of Wings. A mild honey*garlic type; and the very spicy Volcano. Mind, the wings are large, juicy, and tasty. I just wish there was a happy medium of spice that's less than Volcano. 

Despite the lack of options for the wings, they're bloody excellent!"}
{"text":"Great burger place. Original with their \"koolaide\" pickle! I had the goat cheese burger and my BF had the Mac and cheese burger. I have come here 2 times and left full and satisfied. I recommend this place to people who are craving big fat flavourful burger and fries."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just okay. Not spectacular in any way to be honest. I ordered the classic poutine, nothing special. My friends ordered burgers and they were so-so."}
{"text":"Came to party with girls group! it was Sunday afternoon and we didn't have any difficulty to find places to fit us(we were 9). Retro & cute interiors, fun menu with big portion, smily service, very spacious dining space. 

But the most impressive thing in this resto was that the waiter, even without asking him, perfectly separated the bill in 8, including shared pitcher/burger! it sounds normal but trust me, its rare to have such a perfect bill. (we just don't dare complain about small mistakes) I recommend to come here with group of friends, to have fun!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience. Food was okay. I had turkey burger with mash potato and the turkey is really tender. The potato is somehow just so so. 
My bf ordered the blue blue burger. Size of the meat is pretty awesome. But beside that there's nothing much to recommend. 
Overall okay dinning experience with a bunch of friends, everyone got stuffed."}
{"text":"'Seriously babe?? A burger joint? Ugh..fine.' Was my response to hubby's suggestion to come here for lunch on a hot Saturday but man, am I glad I did!

LBeLB isn't your typical burger place.. It's not your typical gourmet burger restaurant either. It's simply a creative experience. Sure, if you want a normal burger and fries or grilled cheese you'll find it and it won't be anything special... But, you'll also find a peanut butter, banana, and bacon burger (SO good by the way) alongside a slew of other crazy concoctions.

Food portions are massive, and the food is super delicious. My goat cheese burger was on point and hubby's banana burger was phenomenal. The fries are good, and so is their pickle! I usually hate pickles with a passion, but these ones are dipped in Kool Aid...... Crazy, right? Right! And whoever knows me knows that the crazier the better in my books! Coleslaw was also good but not amazing.

They also have an extensive drinks menu - everything we tried was awesome. 
 
Yes, $20 for a burger and fries might seem steep, but it's totally worth it! We will definitely be coming back to try some other creative inventions! 

Pop on by and please message me to tell me about what you tried if it was awesome! I can't decide what I'll order next time because I simply want it all........."}
{"text":"Came in on a rainy Saturday afternoon when it wasn't too busy. Great cocktail selection and atmosphere. Try the chili mango drink if you like your rum with a little extra kick - just spicy enough to tingle, but not overbearing. Unfortunately there was no chance to try the food."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar. The menu is so varied and you'll need to pick by trial and error to find your right choices. They are not so conservative in food design and you can expect strange (in a good way) recipes 
If you do not like extremely noisy and fully crowded places do not try it. Otherwise give it a try when the habs are playing and enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"We went here Friday night at 6 to grab a bite before catching the Laval Rocket game. The place was busy but they found us a table that had to be free by 8. Large drink selection and very creative burgers. The fries were good but make sure the vinegar cap is on tight, mine came right off and my fries got a good swim.
The waitress was friendly and did offer to replace the fries.
The place has a cool decor and many big tvs and cool music memorabilia. Make sure you get a reservation because starting at 6:20 the place had a constant lineup."}
{"text":"Loved the \"Goat\" ! The decoration is unique! But it's a bit expensive for burger!"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to love La Belle Et La Boeuf. In the end, I think it's a really chill place if you're down for a drink - but as a restaurant, I don't think it's anything special.

Let me start by saying their drink list is extensive. They have wine, spirits, absinth, beer, really anything you could think of - plus their share of unique cocktails, all of which sound amazing. I tried a cocktail called the Pacman, which looked delicious and tasted even better, and I'm definitely going to go back to try many more (all?) of their drinks. 

The vibe is great, too. The rustic decor plus the crowd kind of makes it feel like a really trendy bar instead of a restaurant, which I think is great. The music might have been on the loud side, but it wasn't anything unmanageable. Our server was super nice, too. No complaints there.

Really, the only thing that didn't leave a lasting impression on me was the food. I had the Beauty burger with fries, and the meal comes with coleslaw and a Kool-Aid pickle. My favourite parts of the meal were the coleslaw and the pickle; the burger didn't stand out as much as it should have, and the fries weren't the best. 

All in all, I've had better hamburgers and fries. As a burger joint, I wouldn't say it stands out. As a trendy place to grab a drink, though, I'd totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Cool pour fêter les annif l'ambiance est assez sympa. J'adore leurs cocktails. Le service est toujours bien et les prix sont raisonnables."}
{"text":"Food was great,drinks are amazing but our waitress was so impatient to make us pay for the food and get us out that we couldn't even enjoy the food or drinks,definitely would've spent more money there if we weren't annoyed by her the whole time as she made sure to mention 3 times that we needed to be out before 7:30 because there was another reservation and probably would've given her a bigger tip but I didn't since she didn't give a damn about the service she was giving and seemed annoyed by our presence,staff was friendly though unlike her so we got out at 7:30 as she rushed us to and went to another restaurant for dessert"}
{"text":"Great food, great waiters and waitresses. Watched the France vs Germany game before power went out due to a major gas leak in the area had to leave to another bar/restaurant that had power and was showing the game. Overall would return, had a burger and classic poutine, glass of Sauvignon blank and the exorcist. Thought it would come out flaming instead was jut meh but a good drank"}
{"text":"Great burgers!
Owner and staff are so welcoming and friendly!
The Jim Bean Caesar is deliscious!
Clean and spacious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful decor, good music, and standard comfort food. The waiter was veryyy nice to us! 

We had to wait around 45 minutes on a thursday night, but it was definitely worthy as all the dishes tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"I had good hopes for this restaurant, but in the end everything fell flat.

First off the drinks. I noticed they had mason jar cocktails, and being a fan of the Distillerie that immediately got me interested. If that's your thing too, don't get your hopes up. The two jars I got to taste (mine and my wife's) were both far, far behind Distillerie' in terms of quality and taste. All of the choices seemed very much on the sweet side, which is not too much my thing, do I decided to play it safe and order a Mojito. First big disappointment. Mojitos are always a hit with me, except this wasn't a mojito at all: they served me rum and lemonade with a twig of mint stuck in it at the end just for the look (the mint needs to be crushed first otherwise it won't give any flavour at all).

When the waiter came to ask about the drinks I thought I'd mention it in case it was a mistake. Second big disappointment. I barely had the chance to start talking that he was already running away. I was able to stop him and explain, and his answer was that they couldn't crush the mint because of all the ice in the jar. 8-/

Food was the third big disappointment. I got the Mad Greek, because I felt like something fresh and had great Greek themed burgers in the past. This wasn't one of them. First I find burgers are to thick, so good luck eating it with your hands without making a mess. It didn't help that the Greek toppings were too juicy and completely falling off the burger. Now that would be fine with me, except that the burger was also tasteless. I had a poutine on the side, and was also turned off by the sauce.

Now in this whole time we saw our waiter 3 times in total, including taking the drinks then food orders. He hadn't brought any water until we were half way through the meal, didn't ask about the food, and took over twenty minutes to notice we were done with our plates. Mind you in the meantime the restaurant was getting more and more empty. I even had to chase him to get the bill.

Now at this point I was fairly disappointed with the experience, and might have given it a 2 or 3 stars. But then came the killer. I decided to leave a 7% tip, which I thought was generous considering the 2.5 minutes the waiter spent at our table, the rushed attitude and the few words. First thing he does one I pay is look at how tip I left, right in front of me. HUGE mistake in my book, something I NEVER did in my years of working as a waiter. But I play along. He asks if I know tip isn't included (duh, I just left you 7%). I say yes, then following his confused look I ask him if he's wondering why is only 7%, which he was of course. When I tell him I was disappointed with both the food and service, his answer was \"Well don't come back, okay?\" with the kind of superior attitude any respectable waiter I know would never dream of having.

Well guess what, I was definitely not planning on going back, now I regret leaving any tip at all."}
{"text":"Upon walking in to this place for a 'date night' with friends, we were blasted with extremely loud music. This causes people to talk even louder; which adds tremendously to the noise level. I checked the decibel level with my phone; it was above 100db. I showed this to the waitress and asked if they could lower the volume; she said yes but didn't actually do it. We basically had to eat and run to get out of there so we could actually talk. Ears rang all night. Yes, the burger was very good but it's not worth getting your ears blasted. Avoid at all costs. Not a good place to meet up with friends since you can't even talk. The ambiance is horrible!"}
{"text":"For a bar with a fun ambience, decent prices, and great music, this is the place to be! Great poutine and shots after 10 PM are $3 (I.e. Jameson). Other food seems a little pricey but the burgers definitely seem like they are worth a try! Would definitely come back if we returned to the area."}
{"text":"Really awesome place to visit while in Québec. It's like American food mixed with French Canadian. So delicious and would go here any day"}
{"text":"This is probably the best burger joint in town however I find the cocktails are on the pricy side in comparison to other burger bars/pubs but overall an awesome experience great food. But the Kool Aid pickles are awesome."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and heard great things about this place so we went for drinks on the terrace. After seeing all of the pictures from Yelp and on the menu of these wonderful rare drinks they make, we were so disappointed. The drinks were watered down, and just awful. Basically stale juice for mine and water for his. I mean it's pretty difficult to screw up a drink that's probably made on the daily. Didn't want to assume but it was apparent that since we are English speaking Americans, they said the hell with us and gave us crap. Why do I say that? Everyone else around had these awesome drinks..... but us.

Seems like the norm for places like this in Montreal, they don't like Americans. Server was nice which is why I gave this 2 stars. But we quickly finished, while the server hovered over us for more money??? 

We WOULD HAVE stayed there for a long time since we were having a nice date, but hey I guess we weren't worth a decent drink. Word of advice - stop treating customers like they are outsiders. If we're humble, good paying customers why would you want to steer us away? Didn't go back the whole trip and never will."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and a poutine. Surely, the poutine should be a lot more saltier, so I took a few bites of the burger first, but nevertheless, it was very bland and had no flavor.

The texture was A-ok, but nothing special that would make me come back here. At least the portions are big enough.

Finally, the drinks are very expensive for the amount you get."}
{"text":"Big portions, average burgers. I'm sure it's good when drinking but in terms of meals it's not worth the price when buns is across the street for $5 a burger."}
{"text":"This time around I went to La Belle Et La Boeuf for drinks with a friend.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how much people was in that place on a Sunday afternoon... No hockey game, nothing special on those TV screens!  They have good prices on tap beer and pretty cool drinks and cocktails served in those BIG jar... Watch out if you have more than one!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, unfortunately, all around it fell quite short.  Their menu is pretty extensive with numerous choices, maybe I just chose the wrong item?  I ordered the Mac Buffalo Chicken.  I don't think I've ever had a more bland tasting meal in Montreal.  There was no spicey \"buffalo\" to it at all and the chicken \"cubes\" were tasteless for the most part.  My friend ordered the Mac Beef Baked Potato and she seemed to enjoy it more than I did mine.  I tried hers and also found that it was rather tasteless.

The staff was not all that great as well, our server took forever to bring a refill and it wasn't very busy.  The bartenders seem to keep the folks at the bar entertained with their \"flare\" style of bartending, tossing of flaming bottles.  Overall, with prices being relatively reasonable I may go back once more in hopes of it being better."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I can see how some people say its overrated and over priced and I agree. But I loved my burger and my boyfriends too. 
I got the Captain Flam (monterrey jack cheese, caramelized onions and bacon) my boyfriend got the Le Boeuf (basically nachos in a burger). I thought both were amazing. Big portions, super juicy and tasty. I will for sure go back to try the Cochon one! 
The inside was very cool, huge wall full of books, and huge bar, beautiful! Though we ate outside. 
Bad points: Services was not very experienced... my waiter looked in a hurry and annoyed... I don't blame him the place was PACKED. Expensive burgers, expensive hipster drinks in mason jars. Last thing... i got mine wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun, I was surprised to see that costed me 1$ extra... at least mention it on the menu if you're going to do that.
I'm still going back anyway."}
{"text":"Ive been to the one Downtown before and liked it much better. The one in the gals was extremely LOUD I had to shout to be heard. The waiters looked bothered by our presence. But the service was fast so I can't complain about that.
I got the peanut butter burger. When the description says \"Burger frit enrobé de bacon\" I really expected my entire burger itself to be wrapped in bacon. Not just a small layer of bacon on top of my cold over cooked patty. Also the amount of peanut butter on this make it basically impossible to chew. 
I think this place is pretty over rated. And just for the level of noise I wouldn't go back to this location. Plus everything is super expensive."}
{"text":"Very good resto. Staff was very energetic the food was good but depending on the bugler you order it can get wet sloppy and fall apart  which was a little annoying.
All in all it was a positive experience, and nice to have a non Surgakis owned option in this neighbourhood to choose from."}
{"text":"This is really a shame because I love the burgers and have always had pretty decent service here. 

It was a Frigid Tuesday afternoon and my husband and I decided to head to BB for a late lunch (330) after leaving the mall with our 4 month old daughter..

Walking into BB (an establishment we've gone enough times to know what we wanted to eat without looking at the menu), the host was busy on the phone and signalled \"1 minute\" to us with a friendly smile. As soon as he hung up, we were told that we could not be served because we were accompanied by a child and that it is an 18+ establishment...

My daughter was in her car seat, sound asleep.
She wouldn't have left the confines of her car seat, nor would she have made a peep. I can understand if I was accompanied by a toddler who could \"run amuck\" that it could be an issue but a 4 month old on a car seat carrier?!?!?? I have been (& worked) at bars and restaurants that have full bars, yet they accept children until at least 8pm! This was unheard of- especially for 330pm and we won't make the same mistake again.

Sorry BB, as satisfying as your food is, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The service and people working front of house are absolutely amazing, but my burger was disappointing and bland."}
{"text":"Went here last summer and really enjoyed it! The burger I got was delicious and the side servings are huge! Definitely would consider going back whenever I'm back in the city."}
{"text":"The King Kong grilled cheese (burger) is by far the best cheeseburger I have ever had in my life. If you come here, you must try it! You will not regret it. Very cool drink menu as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience sports bar. Great music, loved the memorabilia decor with the man's den feel! Fantastic burgers and poutines, excellent drinks off the ordinary if you like or plain on tap!  Giant size TVs all around!"}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to find a damn good burger at a restaurant these days, but man do these guys know how to grill a sweet 8oz burger. With a variety of choices, you will definitely find the burger of your dreams.

I ordered 'La Belle,' which is made up of brie, monterrey jack, fig gel, arugula and caramelized onions. On the side come a deep bowl of fries that are cooked absolutely perfect. 

Apart from burgers, they have a variety of poutines, mac & cheese, salads, appetizers and cocktails. I got to try my cousin's portobello mushroom poutine, and that was delicious. The sauce was rich, not too thick, not too watery, and tasteful, while generously drizzled over cheese curds that were just right. And you know what else? They make fried KOOL-AID pickles. Heck yes! They were great."}
{"text":"First time I ever ate at La Belle et La Boeuf was in Laval a few years ago, I wished so hard that they'd bring it downtown but figured Laval deserved one great place so I'd give them that much. But the universe listened to my prayers, and this year they opened downtown, literally a block away from my place, next door to two other amazing locations -- the SAQ and Juliette et Chocolat. 

My life is now complete... Legit.

I have eaten The Beauty, The Goat, and a classic bacon and cheese. I'd say the goat is my absolute favourite, followed by the classic with bacon and cheese (sometimes all you need is a classic b&c to hit the spot!). The Beauty isn't bad at all, just heavier and more concocted. So it all depends on your mood and appetite! Lately I'm thoroughly enjoying my burgers in a lettuce wrap, ditching the bun; nothing beats satisfaction without feeling like you are about to go into a food coma. 

As for their drinks, I loved their Raspberry & Cucumber Mojito in a mason jar, as well as Poison (though I did ask for it to be a little more sour, to make it less sweet). Go during happy hour and see how amazing their deals are! (Like 30% off a mason jar, BOOM!)

Bon appétit, y'all."}
{"text":"They only make burgers well done. I asked for medium rare and got this waitress not only telling me that the kitchen won't do it, but trying to educate me that hamburgers are not like steak and therefore should only be made well done. Honey, I was probably  20 years old when you were born. I know what a hamburger is and I know how it can be cooked. Predictably, the burger was dry and tastless. The blue cheese burger has no real blue cheese. It's a cheap salty sauce poured on the burger. Very disappointing . Go to Burger de Ville for the real deal."}
{"text":"I love that place! service is excellent. staff is super friendly. drinks, burgers and poutines are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great burger and poutine.  Scotch prices were good too"}
{"text":"Alright! This place is a decent comfort food restaurant with a great drinks selection. After hearing great reviews from my friends, I came here with my girlfriend to try it out. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't blown away either.

We split their Goldorack burger, and it was big! The burger was made with pepperoni, fried onions, sausage and Mozzarella. The ingredients worked well together and the portion was decent. My girlfriend and I were full after splitting the burger and the fries that came with it. The beef was excellent, and I really liked the onions. 

They had a check-in rewards with Yelp, which entitles you to a free shot. My girlfriend and I got 2 free vodka shots, and they were served with a wedge of lime, which was nice. 

One thing that I wasn't crazy about was the music. They play a mix of early 2000's music and top 40, and although it fit the atmosphere of the restaurant, I personally thought it was little too loud.

I noticed they have a big drinks selection, so I may return to try one of their cocktails."}
{"text":"Créature hybride mélangeant brasserie et restaurant La Belle et La Bête propose une cuisine roborative et festive. Dans une ambiance assez bruyante, on est bien accueilli par une hôtesse avec un grand sourire. De longues tables, quelques banquettes un très long bar, le décor est tout à fait représentatif de l'endroit. Le menu étant essentiellement composé de burgers et de poutines, on y va pas si on est au régime. De plus il y a un grand choix de drinks, ils ont adoptés la mode des pots Masson, mais les gros, alors il faut faire attention pour ne pas abuser. Le service est sympathique et efficace.
Le burger que j'ai choisi était très bon, mais la poutine partagée était un peu fade. 
L'été il y une terrasse et il est préférable d'arriver pas trop tard la fin de semaine car l'endroit se remplie rapidement."}
{"text":"I decided to tried their \"Nuclear burger\"! Omg, I loved it! It was extremely spicey! One of the most spicy thing I had my whole life! If you can't handle spicy fold then please don't try it but if you are a spicy person then you must try this! But be prepared to spend quite a while in the bathroom the next day haha. 

I also tried many of their cocktails and they are top notch! They also have a large selection of poutine and they are very deliciosooo! 

The ambiance of this place is perfect for college students to hangout and have a nice pint of beer with some burger or poutine!"}
{"text":"Service impeccable! Notre serveur était très attentionné et aimable, j'étais agréablement surprise pour un vendredi soir où le restaurant était très achalandé. L'ambiance est super, la salle pleine de références retro, vintage (notre soc'e de table était en fait une ancienne machine à coudre!) et du bois qui fait style pub/ grill. Le choix de musique était top aussi. Pour ce qui est du menu, j'aime beaucoup tout ce que j'ai choisi à date lors de mes visites ici: les burgers, le sloppy joe, les trempettes. La carte de boissons est variée aussi. C'est un endroit que je recommande définitivement, surtout l'été à la terrasse super ensoleillée juste devant les fontaines et la piste centrale du centropolis (excellent emplacement). Le line up est souvent LONG donc je vous conseille de réserver. En couple, entre copines ou pour un anniversaire..."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and decor. Music was loud (perhaps because it was close to 9-10pm) but I enjoyed the song picks and even danced while sitting on my chair (to my boyfriend's great despair. We ordered poutine, a portobello poutine for him and a classic for me. The portobello poutine was a few dollars more expensive but to my boyfriend's point, it wasn't worth paying more for the few slices of portobello. According to this distressed boy, he didn't even get an entire portobello. You get the picture. My poutine wasn't any better, let me summarize this for you: burned fries and the cheese was not squeaky. Not sure if I'll ever go again. But like I said, great ambiance."}
{"text":"Downtown, for lunch, looking for a burger and poutine. The place is as big as a calf-eteria (see what I did there?) so I figured I'd get the food quick, and get out. I ordered the basic burger, basic poutine side, and a diet coke. 

I figured a place which sells pretty much only burgers would know the basics. They didn't. 

First, they should be able to cook as asked. I asked for medium rare (red center, juicy), and got nothing near that (see pic). Second, the patty was way too dense, either because it's a commercial patty or because it was packed too tight in the kitchen. Third, it was poorly cooked. A good burger will have a nice little brown crust on the outside. Their didn't. In fact, it was a pretty terrible patty enveloped with a huge bun and tons of ingredients. Unconvinced? Next time you order their burger (if you must), take a bite with only the meat. A good burger, you should be able to enjoy that alone. This one, I spit it out.  

That might have been fine if that burger had cost me $8. But my bill was: $27, for one average burger, a 355 ml coke bottle and a poutine. $32 after tip. Seriously? The meal is worth at most half that. I can't even get close to thinking about recommending this place.

---

Poutine: The poutine was pretty decent but fries were luke-warm juliennes (how do you not have warm fries during the lunch rush?), the gravy seemed like a powder, and cheese wasn't even close to fresh. Ok as a side, but nothing more."}
{"text":"Trop nice comme endroit...avex beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup de choix de boissons alcoolisés...Moitié prix sur la bière et les pots massons pendant le 5 à 7.  Yeah!"}
{"text":"Malgré que ce n'est pas toujours plein comme à Laval..on y retrouve des bons drinks et de la bonne nourriture cochonne! Les burgers Miam...les mini Pogo miam! Bref, je vous conseille ce resto bar :) spéciaux toute la semaine durant le 5@7"}
{"text":"J'ai très bien mangé! Les burgers sont vraiment solides. La sélection de cocktails est géniale, beaucoup de choix pour les bières en fût et les liqueurs. Le service était correct, rien d'assez dérangeant pour se plaindre. Les prix sont pas mal non plus, bref c'est une place de 5 @ 7 assez chouette. Ma seule remarque négative serait le niveau de bruit un peu élevé à mon goût."}
{"text":"SUPER AWESOME!! 
Cool staff and funky drinks, good place to get the night started !!"}
{"text":"I have been to other la belle et la boeuf locations and I must say the service at this location is better by far, especially compared to the Laval location. The restaurant itself is keeping in line with the other locations however as it is a large open room concept, it does tend to get loud in there during peak hours. I had the classic cheeseburger in a lettuce wrap, the burger itself was decent although nothing to rave about. I had a side of sweet potato fries which I was excited for but found it underwhelming! Although the fries were nice and crispy, they lacked seasoning and were bland. You definitely need one of their dips to go along with it to enjoy them and of course there is a charge for that. The highlight of my meal by far was the drinks! I went with the raspberry mojito at the suggestion of the waiter and was not disappointed, it was huge and had the perfect sweetness vs tanginess, they know what they are doing with that one! Also tried a bite of my husband's poutine which was also very good. All in all, I've had better burgers but I would be back for those drinks and the poutine."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, awesome drinks. 
I went there for the first time with my best friend and I was jot disappointed! The food portions are rather big and the drinks are HUGE! 
The bartenders were very nice and it was great being able to watch them making our drinks since we were seated at the bar :).
It was great and I will go back for sure! It's a great place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"First thing you notice as you come in is the decor. Feels like the designer was stucked in the 80s. This is intentional as it is the theme of the restaurant. Service was good good was good but the chairs were not that comfortable. Went theee for an early supper and it was not too bustle but I got the feeling that later in the night,it's more like a bar than a restaurant. If you go, get the aïoli dip. It's really good."}
{"text":"Recommended by our hotel concierge, and was within walking distance - a big plus after walking miles through Montreal. We ordered hamburgs & salads and sat outside, as it was a beautiful evening. After a 30-minute wait for our food, during which time our waiter said \"it's on the way\", we finally asked him what was up? Turns out he forgot to place our order. Human error & he was very apologetic, but tough to see everyone else be served who had arrived after we did. Waiter offered us a free dessert (of his choice - munchkin donuts with hot fudge & caramel sauce on the side). Once we had our food, we were happy. Would we return? Not sure we would. First impressions are important and ours wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. The fun crazy loud atmosphere is there, but there are issues with the food and service. First and most important, what truly worthy burger joint advertises that their meat is always fresh, not frozen, and then requires you to order your burger well done, as that's the only cooking method they allow??? This leads to my second disappointment, the  crazy overkill with the sauce they put on their burgers!  I'm pretty sure they cover the meat with so much stuff so patrons don't notice they are eating a piece of beef closely resembling the hard sole of a shoe. The first time there, I ordered an avocado burger thinking that it would be similar to every other avo burger I've had in the past, ie sliced avocado on top. This one was pretty gross unfortunately because they chop up the avocado and mix it with such a huge amount of ranch dressing that there is no way one can eat the lovely green fruit on its own. It just became a slimy mess and the mayo greatly overpowered the rest of the ingredients. The second time I went, this time with my significant other, the waitress literally kept harassing my husband about not having an alcoholic drink...?!?!? I ordered one, but then she kept wondering why he wasn't going to drink one too and almost taunting him??? Totally inappropriate and to top it off, she didn't bring him his water until well into the meal no matter how many times we asked her. She would pass us doing absolutely nothing and say \"yeah, I know, you need water\" and by the end, she was even laughing at herself for being so lazy! I don't know, it was a strange night, and bad enough that my husband will never return. I'm ok with going there when my expectations for food are not high and I don't want a real burger/ willing to order something else. Portions are very big, and honestly, I would rather have less food and have the menu be a few dollars cheaper. Drinks are fun, but not very strong. Overall, hit and miss!"}
{"text":"OMG no I'm not saying Oh My God, OMG is the name of one of their burgers... I didn't have that one and I was glad I didn't because one of the normal sized half pounders did me in just fine thank you very much.  I had the Capitaine Flam instead.  It was a more traditional cheese, bacon, onion and mayo sort of deal.

I had ordered a poutine as well and with so many choices I didn't know where to begin. Seriously if you have trouble decided things in everyday life don't come here.  Your brain will blow up in your head trying to decide.  I ended up with the smoked meat poutine because hey, we are in Montreal yes?  Well technically we are Laval but you get the idea.  

The food is is something you won't see everyday in just any place.  To start things off the menu is in Francais.  If you don't speak or read French hope that the people you are with do... I was able to get by just fine but there are some things I just wasn't sure of entirely.  

Everything is in order of price from lowest to highest so if you venture down to the bottom items yes you will see some outrageous things like the Epic which I don't think I could finish if I was given an entire day to do so.  For the ingredients of that particular burger there are some things that to me just do not go together but some that do.  For instance bacon and anything just about go but fried Kit Kat?  They should rename this burger \"WTF\".  Add to that brie, mushrooms oh and 4 x 8oz patties.  Apparently from what I could interpret from the menu is said something to the effect that if you finish it you get your picture taken along with a bottle of Pepto Bismal.  After something like this you would need a cab ride home too.  The photo of the Epic looks like a mountain of food on a plate.  I barely could finish my normal burger because my poutine was gynormous.  

My friend had the Pac Mac which was a burger that had the bun replaced with formed mac and cheese that appeared to be breaded and then deep fried both top and bottom.  My other friend ordered a pulled pork that had enough meat fall out to make at least one more sandwich if not two.  

The drink menu says on the front of the cover \"do not open\" in French.  The drink menu is extensive because the bar is like a 10 shelves high.  Some of the items on the shelves are like old TV's and other nostalgic items.

I went to this place on a TUESDAY and it was packed.  I was told on weekends it's crazy.  The place looks like a club at best a bar, not a restaurant/bar and the food they serve is something I'd see on TV because everything seemed kind of unreal.  

The place is kind of noisy inside as it is sort of a bar scene kind of place.  The music is loud and most of it was '80s and it was really bringing me back to my youth.  

This place has to be one of the most unique places to eat I've been in a sense that it's not just a restaurant or just a bar but a real experience sort of what Planet Hollywood was always trying to be and never was if that makes any sort of sense.  

The food here is just crazy.  This is not your typical burger bar... Remember when I said the most expensive stuff was at the bottom?  The two bottom poutines were one with foie gras and the other was lobster.  Ya this place is not Five Guys thank you very much.

Oh ya if you want a shot of Johnny Walker Blue that's on their drink menu too... just a crazy place you would expect to see in the city as they do have one downtown but in this restaurant area in Laval?  Cool cool cool.

We are so going back to this place next time we are back in Montreal.  Literally translated this place means, \"Beauty and the Beef\"."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this restaurant.
It's a massive restaurant. The decor is based on anarchy lifestyle. When you enter you see the bar which illuminated by a dim light. It's pretty cool. The opposite side a small library, with old books designed also with old covers.

The service was pretty good and pretty quick. I got myself a vegetable burger dressed with avocado onion tomato and on the side I took one small poutine. The food was absolutely delicious but too heavy also. Thanks to yelp, when I checked in we got a free shot. My sister ordered a fireball. 

Since it was lunchtime,  There were less people, so the atmosphere was nice and calm. My first time I came for dinner. It was very lively in there. Definitely a great place to try if you want a burger."}
{"text":"This location was okay not the best and not the worst, we sat outside it was lovely minus the fact that we had no protection from the sun. They should of opened the parcels since it was 27.

I had a great burger cheese and bacon and the pickle was great most hate it but I actually liked it (wasn't to sweet it was interesting)

I don't think I would return to this location just because it was so far but the staff and layout was nice."}
{"text":"Mini pogo superbe presentation. I love them you get 5 time for sharing! Try Captain flam and also La belle burger 2 good choice"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool with all the books on the wall and the 80's music it's pretty cool place.

Only thing that was upsetting was the burger I ordered wasn't good at all.

Besides that the drinks are great."}
{"text":"This would be a 4.5 Star review if yelp allowed us to. 

The vibe in this place is pretty cool. I love the decor! There are TVs around the room, we watched NBA playoffs which was right off my alley.

Our server was very attentive. He was able to relate to us, which I appreciated. 

The drinks are awesome and pretty. I had an albator, I recommend it to all tequila lovers. It's sweet and fruity, and the alcohol kind of hits you later.

I had the classic cheese burger. It's big and filling,but it could be a little bit juicer. I paired mine with fries. Coleslaw also comes with it, it was okay. Their onion rings were great!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this restaurant, the first time was at the location Downtown st Catherine and I wasn't a huge fan. This Saturday decide to stop off somewhere to eat before heading home and we didn't want McDonald or subways.

It was pretty busy but we were seated quickly in a nice section not the bar.

Drinks came quickly which is an automatic star right there lol.

The cheese sticks weren't my style I prefer mozzarella that's what I thought they were gonna be but it ended up being orange cheese inside super disappointed. Mini burgers were packed with flavour and sweetness. The salad was great could of been better with big croutons but the  chicken was cooked well and chopped up nice and thinly plus very well seasoned.

Service was over all great 
Food was good 
I would come back to this location"}
{"text":"Pour un lunch décadent végétarien, ce resto a ce qu'il faut. Le burger Janis Joplin est fait d'une boulette sans viande. Elle est servie dans un grand pain frais et garnis de fromage gruyere fondu, tomate, salade, onion, avocat, mayo, et germes de tournesol. Le choix des bières est très bien. La terrasse sur Ste-Catherine donne un point de vue exceptionnel. Le personnel est charmant. La facture est très abordable."}
{"text":"For my taste, this is my kind of a happening spot.  Upon walking in, I was welcomed by loud pumping music - I am a 90's music gal and the DJ got the music right; hip hop and R&B and club hits from that decade - and maybe some early '00.

It was like walking in to a house party!  If #1 you do not like loud, and I mean LOUD music, then please don't come here.  There were tables with sofas, and some of the booths were sofas!  The place was perfectly lit, and the decor was just awesome! You'd really have to come here to see it for yourself!  I was extremely over stimulated!  Sensory overload!

As first time customers, the waiter recommended sharing the mac and cheese,  and a burger that came with fries, but change the fries to a poutine, so that we'd try their specialties.  We ended ordering the Montreal Grilled Cheese (a grilled cheese sandwich with smoked meat, comes with marinara sauce) served with onion rings (comes with mustard?), and an order of regular poutine.  And a virgin mojito.  All so very good, and it was a big portion.  We were 2, and took half of it to go.

Not sure if it was because we were there on a Friday evening at 11pm, or if it was just typical, but I'd say that the crowd was 18-25 years old?

The waiter we had was accommodating - he was helpful to make suggestions and made sure that it was possible to order the drink that I wanted without alcohol.  He was also quick.

A good place to eat or to do pre-drinking before heading to a club.  This is a place that I'd get a group together to celebrate a birthday.  Or hang out with friends, or bring a first-date..... just overal fun!

I highly recommend this place!  Well done!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 
I love this place for the cool ambiance, rustic/hip decor, great music, and friendly staff. Actually this is what makes me like this place so much, because to be honest, the food here is not amazing per se. 
Been here for quite a number of times, and my overall impression of the burgers is that the patty are quite dry. Burger meals come with a Kool-Aid pickle (nice idea, a little weird to me. However the fried ones as appetizers are pretty good!), small coleslaw (bland, nothing special) and a giant bowl of fries (mines were not freshly made, cold and not crispy, a big let down for a burger joint!). I've chosen the house salad in the past, but it doesn't come with any dressing... I guess it's the option for the really healthy ones amongst us....
*Burgers can be personalized (bun and side dish)
Portions are huge, and they don't cheap out on ingredients.
Price: not too steep, reasonable for a downtown location and for the amount of food you get.
Service: generally good, and food comes really fast! Great option if you are starving.

There are many factors that I have to take into account when I rate a place, so as long as I enjoy my dinner at a restaurant, I am willing to come back!
PS: you need to check out the women's washroom, the wallpaint is so cool!! 

Pictured : Captaine Flam, so big that it is impossible to eat with your hands! Better off eating it with fork&knife like a steak."}
{"text":"I came here with a fairly large group, a few college kids and a pair of parents who were visiting their son. We ate in September when the weather was absolutely perfect and had a table outside. 
I had the veggie burger and we all shared some fries, wings and other things. From the silence that descended on the table after our food arrived, one thing was for certain... their burgers are good! 
I loved mine and my partner agreed that the veggie burger was even more delicious than the beef patty he had. Everyone was pleased with their meal and I definitely think I'll be back for more. 
A word of caution, while the restaurant/ bar stays open until later, their kitchen closes around 10/ 11 pm so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good gourmet type burgers with all the favourites. Suitable for families but also very nice bar side with TVs for games and good music. The staff here is awesome. 1 of the mixologist at the bar, Vero, incredible skills and super nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place and great for parties. But it is loud and the service is ok. The food takes a little bit of time but the restaurant is spacious and the atmosphere is kinda cowboy-ish."}
{"text":"I went here as a group of 6 friends and our waiter, Sonia, was great and very quick to understand how we paired up to split our meals/receipts. I tried poutine here for the first time- Poutine BOM, and my friends ordered Poutine Dynamite, which was a bit more spicier with jalapeños. Both were good! Add a little ketchup on top and it was perfect. The poutine portions were also large enough to split between 2 people."}
{"text":"Visiting from Buffalo. This is one of our favorite places we've gone so far. Standard pub food menu, lots of appetizers, great drink list and fantastic service. 

Very lively place and definitely a great place to grab a beer, eat dinner and hangout for a few."}
{"text":"I have tried almost every burger joint and gourmet place and I must say I was very impressed with every dish!!!! The decor and atmosphere is very cool, the place is huge and was packed even though it just opened and rightfully so. It will be the hottest burger place on Ste - Catherine, the menu is original and has everything from a grilled cheese section, amazing poutines and of course lots of original burgers. Everything was carefully though of even sides like the dill pickle dipped in kool aid, a great coslaw salad with a hint of spice and great sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked perfectly with beef crispy on the outside. ... could go and on on and not I don't usually write overly positive reviews was just happy this isn't just another generic gourmet burger place and you eat well for under 20$"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé 2-3 fois et la musique était toujours démesurément trop forte. Le service est correct, la sangria, à peine alcoolisée et leur poutine hot dog, pas mal! J'irais sans doute ailleurs avant d'aller la mais le \"vibe\" est le style de musique est bien. La thématique est originale!"}
{"text":"Le menu fut beaucoup plus varié que je m'y attendais et j'avoue avoir été impressionnée des choix disponibles pour les clients plus téméraires au niveau \"épicé\"! Les cocktails sont même surprenant et très originaux, donnant réellement l'effet resto-bar. L'emplacement du restaurant se voit stratégique dans le Centropolis, mais au détriment d'une terrasse descente. En effet, on  a l'impression d'être entassés les uns sur les autres et visiblement mal à l'aise pour les serveurs qui doivent se frayer un chemin dans une telle marée de gens. Le concept du restaurant est fantastique, mais je crois que celui de Boisbriand me vaudra davantage le détour pour apprécié ma tablée."}
{"text":"The paradise of burger lovers. There is such thing as burger heaven and it is in Laval.

The selection is amazing, from a simple cheese burger to the challenge of a 3 pattie with peanut butter and fried kit mat bars (yes, you read correctly). Let's say the brave (or fool) who dares to order that and finishes it will be included in the Wall of fame, where only the best all around eaters are included.

There is also a choice with jalapeño peppers and spicy sauce, but to order that you will have to fill a form discharging the restaurant of any liability in case you develop an ulcer after eating it.

One more point for this place is the fact that they have Blanche du Chambly on a tap, which, for me, made the experience even more perfect.

Big screen tvs for sport fans all over the place and friendly service, it doesn't really get any better!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service (especially Laura). Only reason I didn't rate higher is because I did not try the food (already ate). Have today that some pretty good looking girls there on the (Tues) that I was there (don't know if they were single),"}
{"text":"So many delicious items in one place! Service can be a tad on the slower side at times, but not too long. I would say that the only downside is that everything feels incredibly heavy - not a place to go if you're on a diet. Kool-Aid pickles are weird - in a good way I guess, dill pickles that are marinated in fruit punch Kool-Aid (I think). Not sure I'd eat a plate of them but they are nice as a garnish. Burgers, grilled cheese, fries, all really tasty, but be prepared to be rolled all the way home afterward."}
{"text":"Parfait pour des soirées en groupe. Les coktails sont immenses à boire. 
bon rapport qualité /prix"}
{"text":"The location is great during the summer on the terrasse. The food is good, but nothing to write home about. What will make me return to La Belle et la Boeuf are the drinks! So much variety and all the ones I have tried have been fantastic. Overall, the ambiance and drinks of this spot are amazing. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Food is good, drinks are amazing and you have a huge diversity. Music is good some days and too loud others. To bring a date if you are looking for a drink to start is ok but to hear each other mmm not that good. Good to go for a drink and hang out with friends before going out"}
{"text":"I am not a Montreal native. In fact, I had arrived that evening as a tourist after a grueling 12-hour Amtrak ride and a subzero walk to our airbnb accommodation. Yelp supplied this restaurant suggestion and we arrived there just before they stopped serving food. The crowd and eclectic semi-Beauty and the Beast-inspired decorations indicated to me that this is a college-y destination. But the waiter was friendly, the food and promptly served, so they definitely value their customers. In line with the college-y vibe mentioned above, the music the DJ was spinning was excellent. Overall, I was impressed with the ambiance and the service!

The poutine was very flavorful and the portion hearty. Granted I had never tried this dish before, so that should be a qualifying factor in reading my review, as I am certainly no poutine expert! But, it offered all the richness I was hoping for when ingesting a meal comprised of fries, gravy, and cheese curds. My boyfriend quite enjoyed his fried pickles, as well. 

Bonus points: When I checked in I got a free shooter. (They have a prodigious selection of alcohols at the bar.) 

A great last-minute find that only enhanced my perception of Montreal's food scene."}
{"text":"Positives are cool, funky decor in interior
                      Big portions for hamburgers
                      Decent-priced entrees


 Negatives are expensive hamburgers (had Golderac hamburger which wasn't tasty. Infact it tasted like a regular homemade burger.

Friend had Brie hamburger which was a mess to eat, basically it was white sauce everywhere . Picture liquidy salad dressing all over your burger. Also tastes Macncheese hamburger which was impossible to eat cuz there was no bread, there was only deepfried MacNCheese buns which fell apart instantly.

Waiter was also arrogant, borderline obnoxious.

Overall, an expensive evening with ordinary food. 

Would not go back to this place, not would i recommend it. Much better alternatives."}
{"text":"Cosy ambiance on a Sunday! Not too crowded, and the orders came in fast. 

I ordered La Belle (comes with sweet jelly), but it was missing a bit of season... Drinks are colourful and picture-worthy, but tastes more like mocktails with no alcohol!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go to near the downtown Concordia campus. Incredible service, playful menu that is both visually pleasing as well as excellent taste. Oh and highly recommend BBQ (fried) pickles with spicy mayo!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is loud and hectic. 
The fish burger my friend and I got was very bland, it was not tartar sauce as I know it, it was more of a diluted mayo. The piece of fish we had was tiny and could be eaten in one bite. It lacked a lot of flavor, the fish and batter were not seasoned at all and the rest of the burger included lettuce and a tomato. 
I got a side of fries and those were not fresh. The fries were either a day old or I was served someone else's uneaten fries. You know when you leave fries in the fridge what hey look like the next day? Just imagine that, all dried up and tasteless and extremely chewy like beef jerky. 
The waitress was ok, nothing extra, did her job but when she took the money she just said thanks in a hurry and left. 

I've never been disappointed there before but I think they made their name and don't have to try anymore. Too bad, I really liked it before. 

Don't let the pretty pics fool you. That was NOT worth 15$."}

{"text":"Visited here from New York and came three nights in a row! If your looking for a chill bar with a youthful ambiance you should definitely stop by. The menu is solid and well rounded but the best part about it is the service! Everyone has a warm attitude and genuine smile. My faves were Ann and Adam"}
{"text":"Very cool dining area, fun atmosphere, great service, but expensive + average food. This was my first stop when I visited Montreal and I got the mac'n cheese and my boyfriend from the calimaro burger with a beer. The total came up to about $40. We came in the middle of the afternoon so the service was quick. If I remember correctly, I think our waitress asked for our ID when we were seated to make sure we were of age."}
{"text":"Des burgers à tomber!! Mais pas donnés cela dit!! Mais original et franchement super bons. J'ai testé le burger \"la boeuf\" avec sa cascade de fromage yuuuummmm!!! Les drinks sont bon aussi, et le service est correct. Même si nous avions réservé pour 20h30 (17personnes) et que nous avons eu notre table a 21h00... Nous n'étions pas pressés mais quand même. Cela dit pour se faire pardonner ils nous ont offerts des shooter! Yeah! 
La salle est immense, il y a un Dj, et c'est pas mal bruyant. Mais c'est le fun un vendredi ou samedi soir avant d'aller faire le party, mettons que ça met pas mal dans l'ambiance! 
J'y retournerais c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best deep fried pickles I've ever eatened!! The poutine and Mac n' cheese are excellent. The burger buns taste a little doughy. Great selection of cocktails.

{"text":"We went there quite a few times, at first with our daughter, even celebrating her 11th birthday there! 

Food was original, very tasty and the place itself was pretty darn cool!

Sadly, they got their alcohol permit and kids are not allowed anymore. My daughter is very sad because they had an awesome sunday bar!

Still, i appreciate their food and still love the ambiance!"}
{"text":"A busy Saturday evening, diner with the hubby (no kids allowed) sitting at the bar.

The staff was AWESOME!!!! We enjoy sitting at the bar, watching them work their magic. And they have great drinks there and a good selection of Whisky/Whiskey/Scotch/Rye.... So we tried a new one and it was very good! Lot no. 40. Another nice find!

Hubby's burger was very much to his liking, my poke bol not so much. But all in all, it was a great evening."}
{"text":"Great burger joint with a good drinks collection and good atmosphere. The burgers are really huge and have plenty of flavor. Great place!"}
{"text":"Had the burger and Poutine at this location.  The Poutine was way too salty for my taste.  The burger was alright with average fries and an interesting kool aid pickles.  The atmosphere is kinda nice with the patio but nothing amazing.  Would be nice to go once for experience."}
{"text":"I ordered classic cheese burger. Excellent grounded  juicy beef and tasty mashed potatoes. For the whole p'ate it's only 14$ which is amazing. The mashed potatoes came in a huge bowl, and I just gave half of it to a friend. The dishes also came pretty fast despite a busy Friday night. Overall, I've had a good experience here, definitely worth the price and will come back. The only downside is that the music is very loud in the restaurant and we have to scream to talk to each other."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a good friend's birthday. What we didn't know is that on hockey night, the place becomes a dive-bar. The volume of the tv was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves speaking over the announcer. When we asked the waitress to turn down the volume, they actually turned it up to the point where we felt nauseous and couldn't eat. 

The food was o.k. but overhyped. The macaroni and cheese is nothing more than pasta spirals with velveeta. The addition of smoked meat is nice, but it's the cheap stuff you would get in a spaghetti from Nickels, flavourless and greasy. The burger menu is impressive, and the burger itself isn't half bad. The best one at our table was the Goldorak with spicy hamburger meat, fried onions and cheese. I was adventurous and got the \"Elvis Gratton\" with peanut butter, banana and bacon. The drinks weren't half bad, though their mason jar drinks feel like a bad knockoff of Distillerie. Trendy and fun drinks but with lots of soda and little alcohol (for 15 dollars, a little bit disappointing). 

I would have given this place two-three stars on food alone, though in my opinion it only merits one star owing to the awful service, their blatant disregard for customers and the horribly loud music + sports. If you want a place to go eat, don't go here. If you want a loud sports bar with overpriced drinks and average food, this might be worthwhile."}
{"text":"A lovely burger/bar place that seems to be popular in the area. It was our 19 year-old's birthday and she went there a few times, but this is our first. They seated us at a table, below the speaker, but we needed to change places since I could not hear anyone due to my hearing problem. Maybe we should have stayed at this table.

The good: Food is excellent. Burgers are juicy and not dry, and cooked through. You have a choice of fries and mashed potatoes with the burgers. Lots of choices. Lots of specials and events. Choices of non-meat burgers also. Decors are awesome (but makes me feel old as 80's stuff is vintage now). The bar looks great. 

The bad: Our original waiter was nice, but once we changed seats, we ended up with an AWFUL waiter and a TERRIBLE service. We had to repeat our orders a few times. There was 20 minutes between us finishing our meals and the cleaning of our table. We were interested in having desserts for all of us, and we told that to the waiter but he never took our dessert order. Instead he came with the birthday Bailey's shot to our daughter and the bill. The manager was talking roughly to our waiter at our table, about another table. One of the staff member, who might have been in his late 30's, or early 40's, kept hitting on my 19 year-old, even after we put the point across that we were her parents (it did not stop him), VERY disrespectful.

The place has a lot of promise and the food is simply terrific. But the staff needs a serious cleaning up as the service was awful, and some bartenders are disrespectful towards young women. Sad."}
{"text":"This place does not care for its clients.  They cancelled my reservation, did nothing to compensate me, had my group sit apart, and the food was mediocre.  I will never ever ever return to this place.  I do not recommend going here.  Not worth it.  Plus, the bosses have the waitresses pay out of pocket to try to make you happy.  Hope this place closes!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I was in Montreal for work and was roaming around for a place to grab dinner. This place was recommended at a beer bar I visited and they were right. I ordered a poutine that had bacon, ground steak,, pepperoni and a freaking large, succulent serving of frois gras. 
I'm pretty sure that it was one the most amazing, definitely unhealthy, things I have ever eaten!

I literally fell into a lethargic, catatonic coma from the decadence that was a result of this heavenly dish. =|~~~~"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I couldn't bring myself to. I went on a Sunday night to grab a quick dinner. The place was completely dead, so you'd think that the service would be amazing but this wasn't the case. Our waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of the night despite there only being 3 other tables in the restaurant. 

The food also fell short. I ordered the Pac Mac and my boyfriend ordered the OMG. The Pac Mac was bland and even after adding salt and hot sauce to it, there was just no flavor in the meat or the mac n' cheese bun. My boyfriend had the same problem, although his was slightly better than mine and he was able to eat his food. I just left mine (not even half eaten) on the plate and not once did the waitress ask if our food was okay. 

Overall, I wasn't able to see why people like it so much. The service is bad and the food is even worse. The only thing this place had going on was a cool looking bar."}
{"text":"Just went there for a friends birthday!! Was able to have a table reserved for us since we were 9 people. Ordered the delicious OMG burger!!!! Was very good meat perfectly cooked with fries and coleslaw on the side. They had a special on shooters too after 10 pm! we all got 3$ shooters. Was definetly a great way to celebrate all togethwr and not pay a fortune for shooters.service was quick too. And they were playing good old classic music like spice girls we all sang along and enjoyed it.Had a blast! Thanks la belle et la boeuf for a great evening !"}
{"text":"Every time I go I try a new burger and there ALL amazing. At the bar or at a booth the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I had the duck confit with foie gras poutine.  If I could eat a single thing for the rest of my life that would be it.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening and we were so lucky to squeeze in two people. This place gets full fast, and a lot of groups make reservations a week before to have a place to sit. If you come here on a weekend, come either early, or reserve beforehand!

The place is convenient since it is close to the 640, and there are an abundance of parking. They have a lot of craft beers, and a good selection of beers. The burgers and fries never disappointed us and it has always been great.

Either if you want a nice lunch or dinner, pass by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"C'est pas mal mais très très bruyant. J'aurais mis 3.5 étoiles mais on ne peut pas. Les burgers sont écoeurants!"}
{"text":"LAVAL... we have a problem. lol. I want to hate this place so badly. A suburb hamburger place that screams doooooche. Fake blonds and muscle men with barbwire tattoos in every direction. But the problem is that I don't hate it.

It's not bad. And in a world of bland Baton Rouge and Madison Steak House, this place is at the top of my restaurants in Laval to get a burger with a few friends. The food is ok. I wouldn't go as far as some of the other reviewers, but it will do just fine. The decor is pretty cool. The service works well enough despite always being packed. And every time I go I LOVE the music. So what's the hate... that guy who drove up in the yellow Hummer? Yes, but I see myself returning none the less. 

PS: The a picture of Larry Bird on the menu. I should give them 5 stars;)"}
{"text":"Very good service and food! I love their Mason jar drinks and also the free shot once you check in! All in all a great ambiance we'll definitely be returning again and again."}
{"text":"The food is good but their burgers are a little too messy for me. The standout are their mason jar drinks, great variety. One thing I'll say is that I don't really like going to this place too late because they tend to blast the music so loud, to a point where you can't even hear or speak to the people you are with. Overall great food and worth going for their mason jar drinks!"}
{"text":"So... breaded, deep fried, Kool-Aid soaked dill pickles with spicy mayo dip. Damn, you know you want to!
Also, a two-player Atari game console that doubles as a table for two. Play every game you remember from your childhood while you wait for the cocktails and pickles to come: Pacman, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, you get it... they're all there under a glass top, with limitless plays for you and your date. 

OK, COCKTAILS. 
These cocktails are epic. There's a large selection of cocktails that come in giant mason jars, about the quantity of four drinks in one, complete with juicy fruit slices on a skewer - starfruits, strawberries, kiwis, all of it. You feel famous just sitting with one of these in front of you. Other cocktail choices are equally exciting, such as the black charcoal cocktail (charcoal is good for you!) called, appropriately, the Vampire. There are fabulous flaming cocktails that are performed by the bartender just for you, fancy-glassed cocktails, an assortment of whiskey cocktails and it goes on. You'll need to spend some time with that menu. They're all so interesting, you might leave loaded. Oh, and don't forget - check in on Yelp and you get a free shooter of your server's choice. And... folks, that's EVERY time you check in, not just a one-time offer! This place is generous.

Speaking of generous - there's much more to eat here than just pickles, too. The foods include really great pub-esque sandwiches and fries combos, burgers, salads (big, awesome salads), etc etc etc - the menu is actually quite extensive for what it is! You won't leave hungry by any stretch of the imagination. I couldn't finish my plate alone and had to force the leftovers on my manfriend.

The décor is fab. It's warm, cozy, tasteful, casual, elegant, relaxed - all these things together, which is rare. You have cushy booths mixed with steakhouse style seating, so whatever you're in the mood for - table for two or tucked in group. Also, best (funkiest) bathrooms in Montreal. Go see for yourself. They are in a really perfect location, gotta say, but it might be easy to miss if you're not watching for it. Right on Sainte Catherine, close to the Guy-Concordia metro. Even though it's a popular spot, it's got quite a large interior, so don't worry about not getting a seat. I'll arm wrestle you for the Atari game table, though!"}
{"text":"Vintage rock and roll atmosphere with unique cocktails. During the spring / summer they open up the terrace which is cool, too. Drinks are great, but service can be a little slow if you're sitting outside."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The service isn't good at all and the cocktails didn't taste what they are supposed to taste. The burgers are fine but the poutines aren't great. I wouldn't go back, not worth it."}
{"text":"Went here friday with a few friends for happy hour..not much of a special for happy hour however the drinks are still very tastefull. Could be filled with less ice and more liquid considering the price. We only had a few entrees , fried pickles are amazing always a must if you come here. Jalepeno poppers were good also, fries were served cold. 
Wide varity of drinks which is a positive, the inside music can be very loud so dont go here if you expect to have a conversation without being a close talker. They also have the choice of a half mason jar on the menu which is good.. but if you take this option I would imagine you are risking having a half mason jar full of ice. Have the fried pickles you wont regret it.. and if you do call me to finish them for you."}
{"text":"We went there on a Tuesday night but since it is in downtown so it was busy. We sat on the terrasse since they just opened it to enjoy the evening. I don't know if it was the wind or anything, but our burgers were cold. Even the first bite was not that warm. 

As for the waiting time, we waited forever for two burgers! We were hungry and even after 30 minutes waiting, we still did not get anything. It made me think that our burgers were just sitting in the kitchen counter because the staff were \"too busy\". I have been to busier places and never had to wait this long for cold burgers. We did not complain about it since we were just too hungry and tired so we just wanted to finish and go home. 

About the food, burger could have been good but it was cold. They were huge and looked delicious. I found the meat way too dry. My mom makes better burgers than this. Fries looked pitiful but the coleslaw was not too bad. 

Next time, I'll take a Mac and cheese as I usually do. 

Tl;dr : not worth it, too expensive for the quality they offer. There are better burger places around. Go there for the alcohol and the atmosphere (not for a date though, it's too loud)."}
{"text":"Always leaving satisfied! Great service ! Awesome drinks! Must try Poison. The burgers are great! The kool-aid pickle is a different yet yummy touch! Service is great. A good place to just hang out eat and grab drinks. Located at the center of centropolis always full of life"}
{"text":"We drove by Centropolis yesterday, early afternoon, and we decided to pass by La Belle Et La Boeuf since we were looking for something new and I was craving for a burger 

They do have an amazing list of different alcohols that you can pick.. In fact, Alcohol menu has a larger selection than the food menu.. Amazing beer and yes they do have good looking Pot Masson.

I'm the type of guy that goes by this philosophy: \"If it ain't spicy, I'm not eating\". I ordered their nuclear burger (it had a radioactive sign on the side) and as per menu, you have to sign a small waiver. The burger was definitely tasty, very spicy but not over empowering. I did appreciate those slices of habanero inside.. the only adjusment I would have to give, there was so much hot sauce on my burger that it looked like a lasagna hahaha (that's my italian side who's showing up)..

Overall.. very friendly and caring staff and the burger was made out of love and I will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"A group of friends planned to watch a movie and since it's conveniently located a mere 2 minutes away from the Colossus, we stopped by to get a bite to eat. We didn't regret it.

Pros :

- The menu is actually amusing to read, lots of witty and comical names for their food.

- Ordered a burger called \"Le Laval\" and a poutine called \"Hey Le Gros\". Both were particularly tasty and well worth going back to enjoy. Kindly note, the portions are HUGE and I didn't manage to finish it all. The poutine is HUGE so it can be a main meal (even for 2!). Burgers are exceptionally well done.

- For desert my lady and I shared a brownie desert with ice cream, it was very good as well.

- Music and atmosphere was retro and kinda neat. Plenty of TV screens to watch a game.


Cons :

- Service isn't notable, while friendly, not particularly quick and requires several reminders to provide for our table. I don't blame the waiter, as I believe he was simply waiting on far too many tables. He provided a friend at our table the wrong desert and quickly provided the right order.... even gave the wrong item ordered freely to the next table. I don't believe service is a big issue but if you're pressed for time, you may want to come a little earlier.

- MUSIC IS LOUD. VERY VERY LOUD."}
{"text":"Je viens d'être initiée à La Belle et la Buf. 
Presque tous mes sens ont été charmés. 

Débutons par les yeux, surpris et heureux d'être entourés d'un décor aussi éclaté, un genre d'hommage aux rock stars du passé et autres personnalités connues. Ambiance de fête, serveurs et serveuses que ma mère qualifierait d'\"alternatifs\", et les portions, OH LES PORTIONS! Les burgers sont sublimes et immenses, tout comme les gigantesques pots Mason emplis de bonnes choses (lire ici: alcool). 

Le nez: ÇA SENT BON. Tout sent bon. Même dans les toilettes, ça sentait bon. Bravo.

Les mains: elles ne pourront définitivement pas contenir l'uvre qu'est ce GIGABURGER. Si vous manquez de courage, les rondelles d'oignon feront l'affaire, hein!

La bouche: rien à signaler. JE BLAGUE. C'est exceptionnel. Je pense que j'aurais mangé 4 burgers, si j'avais eu plus de place. J'ai investi l'espace digestif avec le contenu d'un immense pot Mason... pas facile.

La déception? SEIGNEUR DIEU la musique est forte. Et c'est quoi ces bruits de train et autres bizarreries pendant la partie d'hockey? On s'habitue après quelques verres seulement. Attention aux acouphènes, Germaine! Et oh, c'est pas donné. Merci aux spéciaux de 4 à 7.

À essayer, définitivement!"}
{"text":"I called them during the day for a reservation of 3 at 18h; they replied that they don't take reservations at this time on Saturday. I came anyway with my friends, and asked the hostess if we could sit on one of the 2 empty booths, she replied to our surprise that these are already reserved. Wanting to enquire about that, she said that they can actually make reservations for their own friends.... I was disappointed, and asked to speak with the manager, however he never showed up.
We ordered a mushroom burger which was loaded with mushrooms as well as the OMG an enormous double beef patty, both were yummy.
The waiter was nice, he came several times to the table and checked if all was good. 
It is a good place also to watch for hockey games, and have drinks with friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Montreal hands down!!!!! The best putine around. First I'll start by saying the ambiance of this restaurant is amazing, the food and beer selection is top notch. We stoped I'm on our 2 day stay in Montreal I ordered the putine she ordered the cheese sandwich which came with dipping tomato soup and mashed potatoes both were exceptional!!! Now for drinks, the bartender rocked out very knowledgeable and a true mixologist and attentive to detail. This place is highly recommend and the prices are great for the quality of food and drink!!!! MUSTGO!!"}
{"text":"After finally graduating, I came here with two friends to celebrate.

For a quick bite and a drink, this place does the job. The burgers are great, the meat patties are cooked medium, just how they should be.

I decided to toss in onion rings and smack them in between my burger and it is my go to compliment on any burger I have.

The service is friendly and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Imaginative menu, great quality. Had the jumbo wings and Kool Aid pickles. Wings were really meaty and perfectly cooked and sauced. Good price for the quality of food!  Try it if you like great bar food!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in this place, and we REALLY wanted to like it. 

I'll start with the good:

- Fries were really good, poutine sauce was tasty
- Giant mixed drink in mason jar was very expensive, but quite good (we tried the \"poison\")
- The pickle, while not very good, was a nice freebie on the plate as well as the small cup of coleslaw
- Torched s'mores cake was damn tasty



The bad:

- Server was only OK, wasn't really around much outside of the times we made an effort to get his attention
- No squeak to the poutine curds
- HORRIBLE draught beer selection, all crappy North American macro beers besides Blanche du Chambly
- Cherry Kool aid pickles an interesting novelty, but tastes pretty gross
- Burger itself was nothing special. Even though it had a touch of pink left on the inside, it was not juicy.  Possibly par cooked. 

The ugly:

Let me just say, I've never been to a full service restaurant that is both so completely unwilling to accommodate customers requests, and also so incredibly greedy.

I ordered a $16.95 burger that comes with fries.  So did the Mrs.

To upgrade the fries in your meal to their poutine, instead of charging a small upgrade fee, they just remove $2 off the full menu price of their poutine.  So to sub out your fries for a poutine, it's a whopping $5.95 after removing $2 from their original price of $7.95. WTF?  The portion is no bigger than the fries included with your combo

I seriously didn't want fries with my combo, so I asked for the Mac n Cheese as a side instead.  I was instantly told no, they don't do that.  I offered extra money, still no.  He wants me to order the full portion at menu price for $8.  So then I say fine. How much is the burger with NO sides, and I'll splurge for the extra $8 to try the Mac and cheese.  Again, the answer is no.  They will not sell a burger without all accompaniments.  It's getting comical at this point; the server could care less and never even went to ask the muscle head manager skulking around the restaurant if they can do anything for us.

Now let's get to the icing on the cake, and a true first for me at the hundreds of burger places I've eaten at in my day. 

I asked for pickles and tomato to be added to my burger, the server says sure no problem.  To my shock, when the bill arrived, I was UPCHARGED for a god damn slice of tomato (50 cents) and for adding pickles (75 cents).  So it's not enough you're paying $16.95 or even more for this overpriced burger, they're gonna charge you for every single topping as well.  Unreal..

This place is slimy as hell.  Petty greed is not the way to run an establishment.  Neither is refusing even the simplest requests by customers even when they offer to pay more money.

This place is amateur hour as far as hospitality is concerned. 

I'll post a picture of my receipt when I dig it out of my luggage, I actually kept it because I was so stunned about being upcharged for lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles on a sandwich.  Pathetic.."}
{"text":"The wings are a must try !! Very crispy and delicious . They have a wide variety of beer on tap . Went here to watch the nba  finals and had a huge screen and hip hop music playing"}
{"text":"Great burgers I had the Dallas with peppers. The poutine was the best I've had in Montreal with mushrooms , peppers and chicken . We sat outside and shared a pitcher of beer"}
{"text":"Went here twice during a weekend stay in Laval, the food is fantastic!  Probably the best burgers I've had in Canada.  Their selection offers anything you could want on a burger,  they even have an Elvis burger with PB & banana.  

The first time I ordered my fav, a burger with blue cheese and I was WOWED!  If you don't love blue cheese you might not like it, but for me it was blue cheese heaven.  It was dangerously close to having too strong a flavour but they took it right to the limit and it was a success.  

Even the atmosphere is bold, with brilliant graffiti on the walls and great music providing a treat for your eyes and ears as well.

The highlight of my second visit was a delicious burger with bacon and an egg.  Really really good!  Egg yolk must be natures burger sauce.  It's simple, but when done right it works so well.  I wish my stay was longer so I could try more.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"J'essaie habituellement d'éviter les chaînes de restaurants mais j'avais entendu de bons commentaires sur leurs hamburgers et j'avais faim. 
La terrasse était pleine et seulement une table a pique-nique était disponible. Très bon choix de drinks avec sélection de rhum. Les burgers sont comme à la maison, garnis comme vous le voulez. Servi avec frites maisons, salade de choux fade et un cornichon koolaid. 
Le service fut lent lent compréhensible en ce vendredi à l'heure de pointe. Relaxons et célébrons le week end. Le service fut sympathique mais désorganisé. Tout le long du souper les différents serveurs se promenaient de table en table ne sachant pas ou allait la commande. Restaurant très bruillant. Pas pour un rendez vous en tête à tête. Beau décor funky a l'intérieur. Stationnement facile."}
{"text":"We made the super smart decision to come to Montreal during wintertime. Wanna know cold? Come here when it's -38 degrees. 

We also made the super smart decision to make La Belle & La Bouffe our local watering hole during our 8-day stay. 

Alright, so the first decision may not have been our shining moment, but the second TOTALLY was. 

Everyone in the world - I don't care who you are - needs a home base when they travel - a place where the bartender knows your name and your drink, and the shots flow when you enter. 

That place, for us, was La Belle & La Bouffe. 

Between the talented mixologist, Luigo, the owner Mario, and the sweet bartender from Morocco, Anis, you'll find yourself craving the familiarity of the graffitied walls, 80's music and comfortable stools, just like you would at home. 

Plus, being that it's located right downtown on St. Catherine, it's easy to get to, easy to get home, and centrally located. 

PRO TIP: If Luigi tells you to go across the street to Moose Bawr and order an AMC, do not do this! Not unless the only thing on your schedule the following day is \"Recovery Time\"."}
{"text":"For some reason everyone gets sick after a meal there... drinks are good, don't eat the food... disgusting cool aid pickles everywhere"}
{"text":"Nous avions en vue cet endroit depuis un petit moment et nous avons poussé la porte ce soir !

Au niveau du lieu nous avons apprécié la déco et l'endroit mais qu'est ce que c'est bruyant. La salle de base est bruyante de par sa disposition mais le fait de rajouter de la musique ne fait qu'empirer les choses ... Je trouve ça assez désolant de ne pas pouvoir discuter facilement pendant un repas .... Pour moi c'est un gros point négatif.

Pour le service rien de spécial même si j'ai quand même du demander 2 fois de l'eau et avoir le verre 20 minutes après ...

Nous avons pris un pot mason à partager et c'était bon, surtout qu'il était à 10$ en happy hour au lieu de 15$.

Concernant la nourriture nous étions venus pour les burgers car la carte donnait vraiment envie. J'avais choisi le goldorak avec pepperonni et merguez et il était bon. Par contre pour l'autre, le bleu bleu, ce fut un peu la déception pour Laura. C'était bon mais sans plus, pas assez le gout du fromage bleu ... Les frites n'était pas super ... 
Niveau nourriture c'était décevant, peut être car nous avions des attentes. Ce n'était pas mauvais mais pas non plus extraordinaire surtout vu le prix ...

Parlons du prix ... Nous avons payé en tout 60$ (tx + tips) pour 2 burgers et un pot mason.
Par rapport à ce que nous avons mangé je trouve ca cher. Ce n'était pas mauvais mais ca ne vaut pas 30$ par personne. Je vous parle d'un burger sans ingrédient extraordinaire et de 2 once d'alcool par personne pour 30$ par personne ... 

En conclusion je ne conseillerais pas cet endroit à des amis pour manger de bons burgers sans trop dépenser. Trop bruyant et trop cher pour ce que c'est ..."}
{"text":"This place was packed when we went on a Tuesday night, but it's crammed with tables,  so we were sat right away. Overall we were disappointed with our visit. I really wanted to like this place, and was excited to try it on a recent Montreal trip. I liked the concept of the place, and the fun menu and burger options, but the prices were unreasonable, and the service was lacking. We saw our server twice, once to take our drink order, and once  to bring the drinks and take our food order. No one checked on us again, and we had to flag down another waiter to ask for our bill. 

The food itself was okay. I liked my avocado burger, though a bit over cooked, but the fries were soggy and the coleslaw and \"kool-aid\" pickle were strange tasting."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the burgers were excellent! I got the \"Lola\" sangria and the Avocado burger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun - would recommend both! The burger toppings were very generous and the onion salsa was delicious! My whole family enjoyed everything that they ordered and had a very good overall experience. Would definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}

{"text":"This restaurant is a homerun. It's a big, airy space with a large terrace in the warmer months, great service, fun atmosphere, great location......and most importantly amazing food. I's a big place so lots of turnover and not too long a wait, and it's always busy because it's always good. I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that try too hard to be different and get lost in their own creativity but in this case they knocked it out of the park. Ultimately it's a comfort food place, burgers, grilled cheese and poutine are the vast majority of the menu. However, they have so many tantalizing options for those choices including a variety of dipping sauces to choose from for your side dishes. The portions are big....8oz burgers with unique flavors and options like the 'Heart Attack' burger (not a guarantee of a heart attack but will probably bring you one step closer). My favorite is the 'Goldorak' with spicy merguez sausage, ground beef, pepperoni and fried onions.....sooooooo good! I love that the menu lets you get your comfort food as simple and basic as you want OR as insanely creative and complicated as you want. The portions are big, and it's one of those places where you're constantly looking at the servers bringing the big plates of burgers and huge poutine bowls to other tables and then questioning if you ordered the right thing. Ultimately my biggest complaint is that there are so many great options to choose from on the menu that you constantly questions your decision. I guess I'll just have to keep going back.......let's go, who's in??

P.S.- When you check in with Yelp you get a free shooter of your choice, thanks Yelp :)"}
{"text":"I am certain that my review would be 1 star lower if we had gone anytime after 5pm as the place easily gets quite loud and the service isn't the quickest. 

Shoestring fries?? Bruh. Pub fries or stay home. Correction; waffle fries. You should really consider the change. 

We were a larger group and I. Can't speak entirely to how I felt about the price to portion/quality ratio as I our boss grabbed the bill however it was just above average in terms of pricing with some burgers being laughably overpriced. Our service was great and they honored my one free shot upon Yelp check in so props for that early afternoon Jameson. 

I tried some of the blue cheese burger as well as the goat cheese and I would only reorder the latter. Most people at the table enjoyed their meals however there were 2 people who's stomachs didn't serve them very well that afternoon. 

I can certainly see myself going back for a meal with 3 girlfriends and grabbing a bite however their overpriced cocktails are more hipster than balanced and functional which is a pet peeve as an ex bartender. Their decor was great and staff were well informed but overall the place isn't worth much of the hype."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice as a casual restaurant with good music. The decor is interesting and similar to the other La Belle ET La Boeuf. I ordered the pull pork sandwich. Which was recommended by a friend . Which was very tender and tasty . My partner had the turkey burger which was also very good. The service was not acceptable since we had to wait over 30 minutes for our meal. The manager was apologetic. They have great food but need to improve how they communicate with the customer. Overall they get 4 stars  for the food and 2 stars on service. We will give this location another try hoping that my kindness and feedback to the manager is put into action."}

Their burgers are delicious, well marinated real juicy, they have all kinds of different sizes ridiculous sizes i barely can finish a burger and a poutine because they are so big... They also have lots of different poutine,lots of beers ambiance is good, the staff is great always making sure that get everything you need they also have a nice terrasse if you like to eat outside, or you can watch hockey inside lots of big screen tv's...

Leurs drinks dans les pots maçons sont géniaux mais j'ai moins aimé le cocktail au cotton candy. Très bon staff, pas trop long service :) Et on peut prendre en take out si on veut manger à la maison. Très bien situé !! Le décor est beau, les portions sont excellentes (un peu trop pour moi), le cornichon au kool-aid est vraiment original et bon:) la musique un peu forte mais rien de grave. Bref, je recommande ! Et les prix sont raisonnables pour la quantité !"}

{"text":"I gave this place a 3rd try before deciding to leave a review. I went all 3 times with the same person and orders completely different items.  The first time was great, the drinks were good and the burger was tasty. so decided to go back a few months later and ordered the grilled fish sandwich. The fish was sooo under cooked it was translucent and not even hot. And it just kept falling apart each time i tried to pick it up. I tried eating the fish on its own since the bread basically dissolved in a soggy mess with all the tartar sauce but it was impossible for me.It also lacked on tatse. I hate sending food back to the kitchen and honestly it was my first time ever doing this. In general i'm a pretty shy reserved gal. 
I called the waiter over and sent it back ( very politely and even apologized for doing so) i ordered something else. A regular hamburger with cheese sauce. It was okay.  She so replaced my fries which was nice but not necessary but brought back a plate of tiny fries...little fries that u would find at the bottom of the fryer. It made me feel like the kitchen did it on purpose because i sent back my food.

I went back the 3rd time keeping in mind my first experience. We sat outside this time and i ordered a poutine.  We got a pitcher of beer and our food took 45 minutes to come. ( 2 poutines). The waiter NEVER came back to ask us if we wanted anything else or if we even wanted the bill.  We sat there for about an hour and 30 minutes without any service. Although we clearly finished our pitcher and we finished our food. The waiter came back finally and asked if we were done i said yes and asked for the bill and my left overs to go. He came back  without my bill ...only the food packed to go. He left and started cleaning the other tables. I had to ask him a second time for my bill. ( now thinking of it i should of just left) 

Never again 

Its one thing to have mediocre food and good service...but whole other thing with mediocre food, spiteful chefs and waiters who ignore you."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Came here on a whim, just passing by. Liked the outdoor seating. Menu is amazing. So many choices for burgers and poutine. I went with \"la belle\" which had caramelized onions, Brie cheese, fig spread, and arugula. It was so yummy. I ordered the classic poutine as a side, delicious. My boyfriend had a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and honey mustard. 

I would definitely return if I am in Montreal again."}
{"text":"If you want a gourmet style burger this is a great place. They have everything from bacon and cheese to having peanut butter in your burger or having a \"heart attack\". I love opting for the sweet potato fries and lettuce wrap to feel less \"guilty\". (Beware you will be charged 1$ extra for a lettuce wrap even if not indicated) 
Their Robert poutine is debatably one of the best poutine a I've ever had in Montreal; which is saying a lot.
They also have a great drink menu which includes large
Masson jar drinks, sangria and lots of beer (yay for beach bum sangria !!!) if you go from 5-7 from Monday-Friday you can also enjoy 35% off selected drinks which I can't complain about.
The only down side to this place is that it is a bit on the pricey side however you gain in atmosphere and selection."}
{"text":"Impressive! If you're hungry and you're feeling for a nice juicy burger, try this place!  Premium burger joints have become really popular recently, but only a few manage to deliver.  The atmosphere is always loud and vibrant.  Nice vibe for a Habs game.  If you're in Centropolis and feeling like Goliath, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and each time has been consistent. This is a decent place with interesting burger combos and eclectic decor. 

My most recent burger there was \"la boeuf,\" which was a patty, melted cheddar cheese and jalapeños. Sounds simple enough, but it was actually pretty delicious. Like Taco Bell without the pain. I always go for the sweet potato fries and the spicy mayo, both fantastic. 

I've had some not so memorable items off the menu too: their Mac n cheese and grilled cheeses are very basic. Nothing special about them at all.

I've tried a cocktail off their menu too. I'm not a cocktail guy, and this place certainly didn't convert me. It was a whisky ginger with some leaves in it and probably a syrup too. Too sweet. 

All in all, this place has a very good selection of burgers and I never hesitate to suggest this place when looking for a bite in Laval."}
{"text":"J'aime le style , la musique et la bouffe . 
J'adore les hamburgers qu'on peut enrober de salade plutôt que du pain ."}
{"text":"This place was great.  So. Many. Poutines.  Also excellent drinks.  Drinks were pricey, but not ridiculous considering location.  The theme of the place is also tastefully done without being cheesy.  I would go again."}
{"text":"For some reason I feel that this is such a strange name for a sports pubby place, but don't let it fool you. They have a large variety of delicious pub food and HUGE burgers topped with anything from mushrooms (which I devoured) to sausage to any kind of cheese you can think of. Pair that with a poutine and welcome to heaven!"}
{"text":"Very cool Burger joint and I'm even sure that the nightlife is even cooler!  Looks like a place that would be rocking all night long!  

Decor and music played really does add to the experience.  If you have been to Cecile and Ramone in Quebec City (like a Hard Rock restaurant) this is it's burger restaurant cousin.  I think I like LB et LB even better!

For my lunch I ordered the Classic burger with cheese with onion rings.  It came with a pate chinois (shepherds pie) soup which was a nice interesting touch! The burger arrived with a Kool-aid pickle, creamy coleslaw and a stack of onion rings.  Burger was Huuuuuuge!  I've never had a Kool-Aid pickle so this was a nice touch!  I must come here again to try other items on the menu as portions are very generous.  

Vibe of this place is rock n roll meets hipster cool!  Definitely a nice addition to Laval and Centrepolis!"}
{"text":"Les drinks sont malades après en avoir bu qql'uns on comprend pourquoi ils ont leur mixologue le sandwich bleu bleu est débile tout comme le reste et le staf est de belle apparence."}
{"text":"Food was good with great portions, I took a poutine and it was delicious. However the service was horrible! Made us wait 30 minutes for our reservation and the waiter was inexperienced and rarely came up to our group, it took 15 minutes for us to all get our plates. Mixed up both plates and receipts at the end. We had told them we had a show to go to after and so needed quick service, the restaurant was half-full but we still managed to be late by 25 minutes to our following event. 
Very nice place, but we wish we had gotten service that lived up to the restaurant's food and reputation."}
{"text":"Came here once, we ordered 2 burgers & 2 drinks. Service was long and pricing was ridiculous. Overall, we we're disappointed and we did not enjoy our meal. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered their sliders appetizer for lunch as the burgers themselves looked large for my appetite.

I was not disappointed, neither was my lunch date.  We enjoyed the patio outdoors and the good food and good company.

The server was lovely as well and did not mind that we had ordered from the appetizer menu at a busy lunchtime."}
{"text":"This place has false advertising, had me walk 15 min in the cold, and was closed.
They advertise 2am but were closed by 11:50pm"}
{"text":"Was in montreal for like two days and my assistant said she went here the night before and was apparently already addicted to their poutine so we came back and got some poutine.  Guy said the kitchen was closed even though apparently it wasn't so the waitress brought us two orders of poutine, one regs, one with no cheese since I can't eat cheese. The waitress seemed delightfully horrified by this, but was a good sport. Ate said fries and drank some Molson Export like real people. I promoted my assistant when we got back which is unrelated but I told her it was because of the fries."}
{"text":"This is pretty good place to eat at with a group of friends. The atmosphere is good and they have a cool bar setup highlighting the bottles. I decided to get the 3sum poutine which has different sausages in it. I took a while for all of us to get our food and the waiter was kinda weird. I tried the kool aid pickles but didn't like it kinda tastes like a normal pickle anyway
Once I got my poutine it tasted pretty good and was a nice size. 
Overall this place is a pretty good option to go to"}
{"text":"Just so bad ! Angry waitress, expensive. I order a pitcher of cocktail and it was like zero alcohol. In the past drinks was better .best thing of this bar is beautiful and colourful of cocktails. That's it!!"}
{"text":"Check in on Yelp and get 1 free shooter!

First time going there for a coworker ' s bday lunch and was pleasantly surprised by this place. The atmosphere is quite nice. The place is spacious and well decorated. The bar area is nice and it really showcases all the bottles they have.

You can either seat at the tables or they have booths which are cozy.

Foodwise, the burgers are also very good! The meat is actually juicy (but I still like to put ketchup ). They also serves sweet potato fries which I love. You can also try their different mayo sauces.

I will go back."}
{"text":"Je deconseille vraiment. C'est la 1ère et dernière fois..

C'etait une expérience très désagréable. Une heure d'attente pour un mysérable burger. Avoir de l'eau ou de la moyo prenait une demi heure.

Il n'ya même pas autant de monde."}
{"text":"A fun experience. Very American like food, in that it serves excessive burgers, mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches. It was amusing when the waitress asked how to make a \"Bulleit Bourbon\" but she was sweet and fast otherwise. I ordered a beefy grilled cheese sandwich but after their home made chips and some onion rings I couldn't eat more than half so I took it home for breakfast. It was a huge place and filled to capacity due to the hockey game. Great beer and alcohol selection and all the wait staff are very attractive."}
{"text":"We were a group of 12 people, old colleagues that haven't seen each other in almost 5 years. They had reserved two tables of 6 for us, one behind the other. Which was fine. The only downside was, one of the tables was not ready so we were all crammed into one table waiting for the customers to leave so we can have seats. But like I said that was the only downside. It is an upbeat place, noisy, good music, the burgers are to die for, no body had complaints, drinks were generous and came in a mason jar (that's just sooo coool). The waiter (Olivier) was very attentive and was constantly making sure we had everything or if we needed anything more. Although there was a huge line up, there was no pressure for us to leave. This is not my first time here and it won't be my last. We had a great night, thanks to La belle et la boeuf."}
{"text":"I totally like this place, the juicy burgers, the looong list of cocktails, the fresh ambiance.

Who is the genius who came up with the idea of adding melted peanut butter, bacon and bananas, my favourite ingredients, to a burger wrapped in lettuce. So delicious and there is more to try! Who can come up with the adorable idea to improve the classical Bloody Caesar by substituting the vodka with Jim Beam, adding BBQ sauce to it and two beautiful slices of bacon on top, some smart mixologist indeed. Miss Piggy is a must drink cocktail and the others we had were pretty awesome. The service is sweet and smiley, they kind of took their time in between our drinks, but I'm happy of been given a chance to slow down. Be careful when choosing to sit at the bar, the barman can decide to put a fire show for you. 

Coming back to check the cocktails named after some of my favourite rock bands and of course eat another burger!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Seriously, at a loss for words. The Kool-Aid fried pickles were great, the drinks were strong and the burgers were AMAZING!!! Nothing else to say. The pictures of the burgers describe exactly how they taste... like heaven."}
{"text":"I keep hoping, I keep trying but I have yet to find a \"gourmet\" burger joint or upscale burger that I can even like much less love.

My girlfriend and I ordered a small plate of chicken wings. Better cooked than this, impossible, they were perfect. The BBQ sauce... bring me more. And I don't know if its store bought or made on site, but that ranch sauce was insanely good. I figured, if the burger is half as good as this, we're in for some seriously good eats.

We were wrong, we were sooooo wrong...

La Belle et La Boeuf doesn't break this losing streak. Just another hipster pleasing joint with very sub-par food.

On paper it looks like it's gonna blow you away right? Well that's where the ever important balance between form and function come into play. In this case it's all form and very little function.

You can change your side of fries for a poutine, little did I know they would bring me a bucket of poutine. The poutine was cold. I don't know about you but poutine gravy should be volcanic and melt the fries (that wasn't a mistake, I meant fries). I asked to get a hot poutine and they simple nuked it and it was lukewarm at best. This on fries that were merely passable and not-melted cheese. But the gravy is the only thing that gave the fries a fighting chance.

But the insult of it all was the burger... really, shame on whoever thinks these burgers are good. The bun was OK, the toppings were well, meh. OK I took \"Le Cochon\". That's a patty wrapped in bacon... Look I love bacon more than the next guy but there is such a thing as too much bacon. There is such a thing as proper portions. Topped with peanut butter (blech! but that's on me) and with Port jelly which I could never taste in the burger and Port jelly usually is pretty noticeable, it's got a strong kick to whatever you put it on. The meat was overcooked, dry... I mean really dry and 8oz might be overkill. I make way better burgers that this, I mean massively better and that's using regular store bought meats, cheap POM burger buns and regular yellow cheese. A complete disappointment. 

There was also a Kool-Aid marinated pickle which they claim is their idea - actually it's Joe's White Front Cafe in Rosedale, MS that gets those claims - La Belle et La Boeuf only watched Feasting on Asphalt on Food Network. Plus the coleslaw hash was OK.

The decor is Hipster paraphernalia all over the place. But still a nice decor. The service is good, unfortunately the food blows chunks. It gets a generous 2 outta 5 and only because those wings rocked."}
{"text":"Fun place for dinner. The poutine was delicious but the serving of gravy was too much, and the dish became a little too soggy. The Thanksgiving Turkey burger was very good! Service was slow though and when asked about a side for our burger, they neglected to tell us that it'd be an extra $2.00, instead of coming with the burger. Got a little jipped."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The restaurant looks great. It is decorated with memorabilia from the 70s 80s and 90s. I had the Twisted Bloody Caesar, it had a nice kick to it. The waiter was awesome. Told us right when we sat down to not miss happy hour drinks which were ending in 5min. Food came quick and was tasty. I had a double patty burger. Fries were ok. Their pickles are of a red colour and are sweet, something you'll want to try, trust me."}
{"text":"Burgers were very dry.
Fries were very cold. 
Service was good. 
Drink meh. 

Expected more from this place; it does not deserve 4 stars on Yelp. Sorry."}
{"text":"We liked this place ! 
A very good poutine, good burgers. 
I couldn't even finish my plate ! 

I recommend the chicken wings, the sauce that comes with it taste like haven. 

About the cocktails, it's honestly not worth it for the price. I didn't even feel the alcohol in it ... Too bad."}
{"text":"Always fun to come back here especially with friends on a sunny day outside. Recommend to all either for a drink or food, or yet again both of them. There burgers are juicy and delicious. I can't give any bad review  because each l go there my plate is clean. Variety of drinks. It's little bit pricey but it's worth it. Go see for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for burger lovers, many choices of patties,  buns and extras, you can even have a lettuce wrapped burger. In addition there is burger for vegetarian , fish or chicken lovers.  Tried the mushroom burger, the fish burger and the traditional, all good and tasty, generous portions, comes with either french fries, coleslaw and cool aid pickles or substitutes for a house salad. The menu also include some poutines and grilled cheese sandwiches but i did not try any so no comments on these. Restaurant is trendy with a full bar including many beer selections. During my few times there service was always good and fast. Friendly waitresses. Prices are reasonable for what your eating. The only strange thing i found was the 18+ only it limit my visit when i am with the kids. All said My favourite burger place in the area; definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Fun cocktail selection- all named after bands/singers. Reasonably priced drinks and food. I love the atmosphere! Very hip bar. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'un resto au menu spécialisé dans les burgers et les poutines.

Allons-y \"fast and furious\" pour la critique...

La bouffe : ordinaire, mais les portions sont très copieuses. Mon burger était recouvert d'une sauce visqueuse au fromage qui, au fil des bouchées, prenait la consistance d'une colle à bricolage. 

L'ambiance : nulle ! La musique est franchement trop forte. On n'arrive à peine à s'entendre parler. On cherche trop à créer une ambiance festive, mais ce n'est pas un bar ici, non ??? 

Le service : excellent, rapide, efficace, mais sans être très poli. 
 
En bref, je ne recommande pas vraiment, à moins d'avoir envie de :
1- manger lourd et gras. 
2- de se faire casser les oreilles toute la soirée. 
3- d'avoir une bande d'ados comme voisin de table qui passent la soirée à se prendre en selfies."}
{"text":"Les frites sont pas si bonnes et les portions trop grosses pour une seule personne, mais la plus part des boissons sont super!! (Exepter les sangria, alors la elles sont decevantes)"}
{"text":"The burgers are big!  I ordered the Avocado burger, the bun was perfect, the sauce was delicious and they're far from stingy with the avocados which is great! The meat is less than average in my opinion (hard to find tasty meat in Montreal)"}
{"text":"Very good location. Very nice place with a nice atmosphere. Good staff. My one major issue is that they only serve well done burgers. I am used to ordering all my burgers medium-rare in Montréal and this was just a huge disappointment. Burger was dry..."}
{"text":"Je suis allée essayer ce restaurant avec ma soeur. Tous mes collègues y vont régulièrement surtout pour voir les matchs de hockey ou boxe. On me disait que la nourriture y était bonne mieux qu'un pub sportift traditionnel. Nous avons débuté avec une poutine à partager, très bonne rien à redire. Puis ma soeur a pris un sandwich de poulet style club et moi le burger végétarien. Je suis une grande mangeuse de burger végé et je dois admettre ma déception. La boulette n'était pas vraiment savoureuse et manquait beaucoup de sel. J'ai dû garnir de mayonnaise pour compenser le manque de goût. Les frites de patate douce étaient tout de fois succulente. Bon service par une équipe jeune. Peut être bruyant lors d'événements spéciaux sinon nous nous étions bien et le serveur à été charmant :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff who catered to us like no other place I've been. Burgers and pontine were excellent.  Huge bar, nice beer selection and definitely would go back next time I'm in Montreal. Dominic was our waiter and a great one at that."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break with my colleague. It  took 15mins to get served & after ordering.. they returned 20mins later to tell us that they don't have what we want available!(Pogos & chicken tenders) Soo disappointed! wasted my whole lunch break for nothing!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service, when I went there asked for a water , never brought me any after I placed my orders,  I asked 3 times. When I went home I realized I lost my scarf there, calling on the phone and the person picking up just said to me right away that no scarfs without even taking a minute to look and in a rush to hang up the phone. Mojitos in a jar watered down..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great food. 
If you crave a burger and a great poutine, this is the place to be. 
We were 11 guys and service was a bit slow but all the girls are very NICE so we didn't mind... :)
Great mixed drinks menu.
You gotta try this place!
Nice and trendy"}
{"text":"Wow I must have really caught this place on a bad day, basically we stopped by for lunch one Sunday afternoon and ordered some burgers.

What was good: 
Portion and presentation was good.
Service was friendly
Decor and location was great

What was not good:
Burger was bland, all I could taste was the BBQ sauce.  Even when I cut a piece of meat on it's own without anything on it I felt it tasted like something freshly thawed and cooked in a microwave.

The other thing I wasn't crazy about is choices were not presented to us when ordering.  If the menu says you have a choice of A, B, C then ask the customer, don't just assume and bring them \"A\" because that's what 80% of customers choose.

Again I'm sure this was an isolated insolent and based on the other reviews I'll give this place another try and update my review based on that."}
{"text":"extremely loud music, long wait for taking orders, not gonna get a refill if you just take water, but the good thing is you'll get your bills super fast, if you said \"maybe later\", the badass waitress will send her manager to make up some reservation shit to throw you out, then she will come with a POS terminal telling you what a big deal this restaurant is and that we should tip her whatever"}
{"text":"This is a very cool burger joint that just opened in the heart of downtown recently.  They have a vast selection of burgers and other types of sandwiches.  There is even mac and cheese if that's what you're in the mood for.  They also have an extensive cocktail list that includes mason jar cocktails.  

Come hungry because portions are HUGE.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was probably enough for two people.  That being said it was quite tasty.  The meat was tender albeit slightly dry.  It could have done with a bit more BBQ sauce but it wasn't that bad.  The onion rings were also a hit being crispy and not greasy at all.

My major complaint is with the music level which was way too loud for my liking.  I hate having to scream at my dining companions and I had to do just that here.  Turn the volume down a little!

Overall I did enjoy my experience here and would come back again in the near future.  The prices are very reasonable for what you get and the food is tasty.  Service was also quite good."}
{"text":"I took my dad out for lunch and drinks. I have to say it was the best burger i have had in a long time. I just had the classic burger but The meat was perfectly cooked and had a good taste. It came with a house salad which has exellent homemade dressing! My dad had the epic burger which was huge and delicious! I had the beach bum drink which was delicious and my dad has the chambly beer. I recommend for any of you who love burgers and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great place
Amazing food. Best burgers in town.
Amazing drinks
Service is great
Great price

One of my top burger/bar place."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! You can't go wrong with the lobster grilled cheese!! The cheese inside is brie and they are generous with their lobster. The grilled cheese comes with a garlic dipping sauce. Also if you order fries you can get a sauce for $1. I've had the same grilled cheese at the Laval location but this one was even better! Their drink menu is quite extensive. I've tried a few of their drinks before  and liked them all. This time I only had the Caesar which comes in a huge Mason jar garnished with a pickle , bacon and sausage. I ended up putting the bacon in my grilled cheese. Bacon is good with everything! The restaurant is fairly big and there's a terrace in front. This place has a fun ambiance....it's loud and there's a DJ."}
{"text":"Le menu assez qool, bbq et boys menu, les mug cocktail sont assez impressionnant. Le décor en arrière du bar très jolie. À conseiller. 7.5/10"}
{"text":"Came to this bar last night to watch UFC202. Because the Sport Station was full. 

A little bit pricy but good enough to hangout with friends. I ordered a mixed drink in a big cup with an ice ball on top. Not bad. They have different flavour to try out. 

I also noticed that if you do a \"Check In\" with Yelp. You can get a free shooter with your pick. 

For sport event, they don't put TV sound until main event. But good enough. Good ambiance etc."}
{"text":"I finally got to try La Belle et la Boeuf. It was really good. I didn't get my mind blown, but I was also a bit conservative with my order. I wanted to try a \"standard\" burger before diving into the crazy stuff on a next visit.

The burger was really solid. I had the Capitan Flam. The beef is indeed excellent, but there were too many caramelized onions. They really exaggerated, it was a total waste.

The fries were cold and uninspired. The classic mac and cheese was all right but nothing to write home about. The poutine was also good but again, not mind blowing.

The cocktails are nice and somewhat reasonably priced, but the dessert was my favourite part. We shared the chocolate chip cookie; it was finger-licking good! 

Overall, I enjoyed it, next time I'll risk it with a crazier burger like the nuclear or a heart attack. 

I would recommend it for a rowdy group of boys looking for a wild night of booze and excessive calories."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriends. We liked the drinks a lot. However I did not like veggie burger, it lacked the flavor."}
{"text":"Beautiful people and solid food. The bar has a great scene with awesome decor. The only thing I would note is that the entire restaurant seemed to be a \"bar\" so I wouldn't really recommend this place for families. I left feeling way too stuffed from a small dish of poutine and a shared smoked meat sandwich, but it was all highly satisfying. With that said, I DO NOT recommend the kool aid pickle -- it reminded me of cherry children's medicine. Stick to the Montreal classics or one of their huge burgers and you'll leaving happy and full. The service was pretty slow and it wasn't overly packed, but all of the waiters were handsome so we didn't mind, haha!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good but I'm not sure what all the hype is about. And what's with the pickles?!?"}
{"text":"Cool place located only minutes from Concordia campus, where you can have some drinks and hearty food.

I love their decor and service was pretty quick for a big busy place. I can imagine this would be a good choice for 5 à 7 with colleagues or friends."}
{"text":"Just eat here okay.

Everyone else has told you why. I am just saying they're right. 

Eat here

Kool Aid pickle

Poutine 

Fried egg burger. 

Just go here. Okay?"}
{"text":"Burgers are really good. Wait staff wasn't the friendliest and servers are too slow or take your plate when your fork is still in your hand . Cocktails are super badass"}
{"text":"The service was really slow and we waited over an hour for our food although it wasn't busy. However, the server kept reassuring us that it is taking a bit longer because my friend had ordered cod which takes a little longer to cook. The food was so filling and delicious that we stayed full all day and had a small snack for dinner. We were also tourist so we were walking around all day in the hot sun and still managed to stay energized. The server then gave us sugar donuts with chocolate and caramel sauce to make up for the wait. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute with a book shelves covering a large wall paired with an edgy feel and music to imitate the beauty and the beast. We ate at the st-Catherine location."}
{"text":"They wouldn't seat us with children after 6 on a Friday. Weird.  Food looked good but we had to move on."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Regular burger with fries, same as you'd get at any restaurant at half the price. Place gets crowded with a douchebaggy crowd."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time coming here with a friend I had ordered a mac and cheese with bacon. Let me tell you the cheese sauce was at the bottom the bacon was in balls never seen mac n cheese like that. And the dessert the cheesecake was full of a fruit topping the cake was lost in it. Maybe another time I will try something else the drinks are okay."}
{"text":"Pros
- The food came faster than expected  (hockey night)
- Sweet potato fries were well executed 

Cons
- Waitress was rude
- Mayo has to be specifically asked as a side otherwise you get a dry burger. (They're encouraging you to ask for a flavored one with a markup)
- The burger itself is slightly bland so it needs to be covered in cheese and other toppings
- SUPER noisy. It's obvious they're discouraging long conversations (eat, cheer, gtfo)
- Fries were overcooked in dirty oil
- My buddy's beer was skunked"}
{"text":"Definitely not happy. First off, they didn't want to tell us an approximate wait time . We we waited for 40 min only to get a bad table in which we had a time limit of 1hour 15 minutes. The drinks are not as pleasant as others rate them. These too much ice and not enough flavor. The food was not as bad thankfully. However, I have been to this restaurant chain 3 times and have not had a good experience yet."}
{"text":"The poutine and mojito were great! Friendly service and decent prices. Young crowd and fun music."}
{"text":"Had lunch with 5 co workers. The burgers were great, service fine. A retro 80's atmosphere and soundtrack blasting. Looks like it would be fun for evening drinks."}
{"text":"The ambiance, decor, and the staff are why this place gets the star. However, several points, based on five visits: the wait time for food and drinks is rather long (even when it's not really busy); the burgers are inconsistent (charred to a crisp but bloody inside, dry, chewy, etc.); their drinks are very sweet. I ordered the classic poutine three times, and it was very consistent, and I have returned it every time for the same reason: the fries were burnt (charred); additionally, there weren't a lot of curds, and inadequate gravy. In fact, if there was more gravy, the poutine wouldn't have been too bad, because their gravy covered up the nasty burnt oil/ash taste. The owner told me that it's not the cook's fault because everything was standardized. All this aside, its one of the worst classic poutines I've ever had; poutine score: 1/5 (that's for the gravy, though they could tone it down on the salt on that too)."}
{"text":"This place was much more than I was expecting! The atmosphere is really neat - lots of different decor on the walls, TVs for sports fans, and music to keep the mood fun! So many of the food options were mouthwatering and it was hard to pick just one entree! I was in a group of 13 so drinks took a while to arrive. This, however, is not surprising since so many of us ordered specialty cocktails that seemed quite intricate. I can't speak for the rest of my group, but my custom burger was delicious - just cheese and carmelized onions with chipotle mayo - yum!! The poutine on the side was enormous but also delicious. Server was very friendly and patient with our group size - she also had no problem splitting up the tab which made paying easy for us!!"}
{"text":"Ok burgers and mac and cheese... not a fan of the poutines. Drinks are creative and sweet, everything is sugary if you like that kind of stuff. It is a burger bar so the decor is appropriate, but I always find that when the cheapest burger is 15 bucks... its a little expensive. Staff was nice but the place is insanely noisy... not a good place for a date unless you like screaming"}
{"text":"Great poutine, happy hour specials, and free shot of whiskey with yelp check in.....what is there not to like?  Our server was attentive and helpful and the vibe of the place is fun and comfortable. 

 My boyfriend and I had heard that good cheese curd was supposed to be \"squeaky\" and considering we are from Philadelphia we were confused how a sound could positively describe a food...well we figured it out here.  This was our first poutine in Montreal and we were happy with the result.  Now we just have to come back when we are hungrier so we can get burgers."}
{"text":"Are you looking for awesomely good food??? Look here!!! Great atmosphere, awesome food (like really gooooood), great music (the best), nice service, original dishes names! You won't regret for sure.

Oh and, there are a few special stuff in the menu! Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is great, the drinks are interesting and really good. And the best part are the burgers. One of the best places for really good burgers. Some may argue, but If you're looking for a meaty patty with lots of interesting toppings, this is the place. Oh, and the prices are very reasonable for what you're getting."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate the birthdays of me and my girlfriend, i also met up with 2 other friends and we were asked if we wanted to be seated outside or inside so we went with outside since there won't be that many more beautiful days left. I ordered the Captain Flam burger which has Monterey Jack cheese, smoked bacon, caramelized onions and spicy mayo and oh boy was it so delicious with the right amount kick to it, very fresh and the buns were fantastic. It also comes with some choices of side dishes so I just took the fries, the fries were not that good, not sure if they were slightly over cooked or the oil was too old. The coleslaw which is also included was really good because how different and how much flavor there was and the coolaid pickle on top ohh man it had a good crunch and it tasted really good for a pickle. My girlfriend did not want her coleslaw claiming it was bland or meh so I tried hers and she was right.

The waitress was really nice, She gave us some glasses of water and I asked if we can keep the pitcher of water because I despise having to wait 20+ minutes for water but she said that the boss does not like that...(grrr mr. Boss man) but we never ran out of water and made sure we were served well. One of my friends mentioned it was my birthday and I thought ohh boy here we go with the embarrassing happy birthday bit but she just brought me a very small cheese cake with a sparkler on it. That cheesecake is to die for, the cherry glaze topping is great and goes well with the cheesecake and at the bottom I'm not quite sure what it was but it was sooo good.

If you want a fantastic burger and don't mind paying a bit more then usual come to La Belle et la Boeuf, Super friendly and fantastic service A+, my compliments to the chefs, you guys cook a mean burger."}
{"text":"Great decor, depending on where you sit you can experience a totally different atmosphere. Tried a couple of cocktails, loved the presentation. Although the drink menu is very extensive so being able to chose which ones to try was a struggle."}
{"text":"Great place great atmosphere second time here and had a blast. Bartenders great service and the owner was a great guy very approachable. The burgers and drinks were amazing, if it's not on the menu they will accommodate your needs and wants.."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and I still love it every single time. Prices are very decent and every burger is better than the next. The atmosphere is very hip and young and bar like. Their grilled cheese and pb&j are to die for!"}
{"text":"We went there this week. Many times we passed by this place, but finally we tried. 
We both were eating the beeeeef burger.
Ok, I'm really picky in burgers, but I have to admit it was the best in my whole life!!!
My hubby asked with poutine which was awesome, too. I was eating with sweet potatoes, it was fine.
The service was really kind.
Don't forget check in here, you can get free shot. I got it! 
Definitely coming back.
From me 5*"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times with my partner, and every time I always want to give it a chance again, but I am always unimpressed. Admittedly, I'm a vegetarian, so burger places are always a bit hit and miss for me, but everything here is so heavy, fatty, and lacking in flavour. I can't stand the veggie burger here. It is mushy, tasteless, and the ingredients just don't go well together. The salad options aren't great either. The goat is tasty for a few bites, but it's so salty, and so rich it's hard to eat more than that. I'll hand it to the place that it has a lot of really good character, and the kool-aid pickles are a nice touch. But that doesn't make up for food, and the service has never been stellar either."}
{"text":"Came in after a hockey game at Bell Centre. Short walk from there. Great atmosphere and a very friendly staff! The food was great and they have many interesting poutines and burgers to choose from. Their bar is gigantic and they have a lot of great beers to choose from as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Je voulais tester ce resto burger depuis un moment et je ne suis pas déçu. Très très bonne qualité de viande. Les ingrédients sont de qualités et les portions sont même trop généreuses pour notre plus grand bonheur. Les cocktails sont délicieux et le choix est très vaste. Je ne mets pas la note maximale car l'endroit n'est pas propice au calme et  à l'intimité mais l'ambiance présente ne le permet pas et c'est un choix voulu. Belle découverte en tout cas et je reviendrais entre amis plutôt qu'en couple ou en famille"}
{"text":"Awesome place, very glad I stumbled upon here when hungry after a meeting in Centre-Ville. I made it back to my Airbnb rental nearby to change and drop my laptop bag and didn't feel like walking really far since it was -20*C outside. 

Yelped this place, central location near the Guy metro and it was really happening round 7pm Friday night. Great happy-hour kinda vibe, big screens in the corners so you can follow the hockey game w/out sound but mostly music and young-ish people talking as background noise. Median age at this place had to be between 21-27.

Yelp check-in bonus = free drink, funky meatpacking plant style entrance complete with big doors and plastic stripping, quickly seated by a friendly host [might have been the manager] who clearly liked his job, great drink selection, and the ultimate burger win - Captain Flam - based on my waiter's recommendation.

I was solo and sat at the bar but they offered me a table, service was pretty fast given how packed the place was on a Friday evening but would go back if in the area and craving burgerfare again."}
{"text":"Ce que j'aime ici ce sont les boissons de couleur. Eh oui ! Je fais ma \" sortie de placard \". La bière, j'y connais rien. Jusqu'à présent, le Galactica remporte la palme !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   Classic food.  Great prices.  Recommend it to everyone. Big or small!!"}
{"text":"Had to check out the poutine and I'm glad I did, it was superb!  Unique grilled cheese sandwiches and delicious house dressing (mint!) made this an excellent casual dining choice."}
{"text":"J'y suit retourner parce que mon amie n'y était jamais aller et plusieurs de nos amis arrêtait pas de nous dire combien c'est bon.

Mais comme ma visite précédente, C'était catastrophique. Nous y sommes allez pour le souper, Je me suis dit que ça serait différent du dîner surtout que le dîner était dans la 1ère année d'ouverture.

Nous avons pris une boisson chaque, j'ai malheureusement oublié c'était quoi. Je me souvient que ce n'était pas mauvais.

Pour le repas, chacun un hamburger différent. Les deux sont arriver ultra huileux (le pain), Moi pain froid et viande tiède, Et tout les deux dégoulinant de gras, sans compter le fromage plus que overkill.

La viande goutais rien malgré la sauce bbq. On avait l'impression de croquer dans un hamburger fait de gras et de viande. Les frites était pas super non plus. Bref, j'ai confirmé mon opinion sur le resto et mon ami ne veut plus rien savoir de cet endroit."}
{"text":"Came here for the burger and I got to say I did enjoy it. a little pricey tho so it's not a place you want to go at every week . I will eventually come back. I took the OMG burger and could not finish it it was a huge plate."}
{"text":"They have amazing food! It was super crowded when we went there but we sat at the bar and loved it. They also passed out free shots to everyone at the bar! :)"}
{"text":"On aime, la bouffe goûteuse, les portions gargantuesques, les cocktails géants et magiques, le petit look des serveurs(euses), la déco, les sofas vintages, l'ambiance de party. On aime moins, la musique qui est parfois trop forte, la facture salée, l'air bête du manager qui chicane souvent les serveurs dans l'allée centrale ( pas full professionnel tsé!). Mais on oublis les inconvénients et on revient parce que la musique est quand même pas mal bonne pis que les cocktails nous manque tellement!"}
{"text":"Ses la premier fois que je vais à se restaurant et s'était très bon grosse portion on ses pas quel prendre tellement qui en a"}
