{"text":"envirment nice?food Japanese style. Black cod is good. Tea really rice with eel good, cow tongue a little bit difficult to chew."}
{"text":"So much fun. 
You'll like the experience although it is a nice experience (not for everyone).
The food is a lot better that you would expect. It's actually superior to most Japanese pubs in Montreal (if not almost all). 
The service is efficient and they adapt well if you want advice or if you prefer to be in your bubble for a date. 
They have one of the largest selection of sake in the city.
Certainly a great place for a meeting between friends and even in big groups. 
A sure bet for a good time."}
{"text":"Service is very good and fast . This restaurant has mainly finger food . It's better to eat it with beer not as a main dish . The shrimp tempura and salmon tArtare were good . The soup was bad and the octopus wasabi is very weird . If you wanna taste a. Better Japanese restaurant go to kazu"}
{"text":"A very decent izakaya . This place is ALWAYS packed so prepare yourself for a wild night and lots of noise. 

Food is delicious (fried chicken skin, octopus balls, miso beef tongue are to die for), Sapporo is flowing (12$ for a LITER, decent princing!) and the sake selection is good too. Weekly specials are always a must.

Service is quick, almost too much at times. But I insist on saying that the chefs put much care in their craft (I eat by the bar every time) and no shortcuts are taken in terms of quality and flavor.

Take your friends out for a good, decently priced and tasty meal and a huge mug of cold Sapporo !"}
{"text":"When you walk into the izakaya, there is a huge coat rack on the right hand side of the wall where most people hang their outer coats. I'm not a huge fan of public coat racks (I always have a fear that someone will snatch my coat up) so I didn't use it, but the coat rack is free so you should definitely take use of it if you don't mind!

The waiters, chefs, bartenders all greet to you in one large voice which is typical at Japanese restaurants. This always makes me blush a little. Hubby and I were seated very quickly and we dived for the menu. The menu was in two parts: the regular menu, and the 'Chef's menu' which also looked like a comic strip. There were so many delicious looking tapas that we wanted to try, so we had a pretty difficult time narrowing it down to a few.

We decided to order 3 tapas to start, then we ended up ordering dessert, which we weren't planning on having! The waiter was very prompt, and always alert, which brought us fast service. My hubby was able to flag down a waiter almost immediately which satisfied both of us since we were very hungry that night.

We started off with mackerel sashimi, one of my favourites. When not done right, the fish can be a bit hard to eat because of its distinct scent and taste, but here at Imadake, it was done right. The waiter, after bringing it to our table, blowtorched the sashimi right in front of us which made all neighbouring tables turn their heads. We couldn't wait to eat it as we saw it torched in front of our eyes! The taste was amazing; it had a distinct vinaigrette taste to it although there wasn't any vinaigrette on it. This taste was because they added lemon juice on top of the mackerel, taking away a lot of its distinct taste so that it is easier to eat. The fish almost melted in our mouths and we definitely knew that the plate of sashimi was not a portion to share!

The tuna tataki was done very well, just cooked enough on the outside to provide it a different texture yet keep the inside very moist and delicate as sashimi should be. The yuzu sauce marinade was very tasty, and we were both happy with how sweet yet fresh it was. When the tuna tataki was eaten together with the marinade and shredded onions, it was very refreshing and we were able to enjoy multiple textures which balanced everything out. As an ending note, there were pink pepper (the small pink balls on top of the tataki) which was a great contrast to the sweet and sour tastes of the dish.

We are a fan of ramen, especially good ramen. Here at Imadake, their miso broth was very rich and savoury. The portion of the ramen was surprisingly large relatively compared to other tapas we had ordered. The pork belly was quite soft but still chewy, pretty average. If we were to compared Imadake ramen to regular ramen houses, the only downside would be the price: since Imadake is a tapas-oriented place, for the price you pay, the portion is smaller to what you would get at a regular ramen house; however, the taste is just as good if not better than some of the many ramen places we have tried in Montréal!

After our bowl of ramen, I really wanted to try Imadake's taiyaki parfait, as I had been craving the traditional taiyaki dessert for awhile. The actual taiyaki was the real stuff and it tasted just how I imagined it. The cake batter was very fluffy and the sweet filling was just how I remembered. On top of the taiyaki, there was vanilla ice cream with raspberry syrup, which was a great balance, since the taiyaki was pretty hot inside. The coldness of the ice cream played very well with the hot sweet red bean paste in my mouth, and I was one happy girl. The raspberry syrup was a surprise, as I didn't expect it to go so well with taiyaki. The strawberry pocky and frosted flakes at the very bottom of the parfait provided much needed crunchy texture to the dessert, and also acted as a good ending note.
Would I order it again? Yes. Although I really want to try their other Asian-inspired desserts!"}
{"text":"Reservation @ 9:00, ended up being placed at the bar with staff bumping into us while eating, every table screaming about sake bombs, funny once but gets old really fast, sub par food(pancake was doughy and barely add any seafood). Not a great experience. Never again."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my Japanese friend. We both loved the food, especially the okonomiyaki, it was authentic."}
{"text":"Best izakaya in Montreal! After being disappointed by many imitation izakayas in the plateau and mile end (Thazard was atrocious), was happy to find this one! Great food, great service and fun ambiance. Gindara and ebimayo are the best. Finally, a legit Japanese food experience in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here but this is what an izakaya should be, and i should know, I spent ten years in Tokyo as a salaryman, so drank and ate many nights away in them with clients!"}
{"text":"DANGGG.... I love Imadake! Shout out to Reno the floor manager for always taking care of me and the crew when your boy is in town.

Perfect for large parties. It's always loud and full of beautiful and energetic people; both the guests and the employees. Every item on the menu is fucking delicious, but two of my favorites are the boeuf that is cooked on hot rock right at the table, and the crispy chicken skin... DANGGG.

Reservations are not required per se but if you're in a party of 4+ it is imperative you call ahead - like, literally DAYS ahead - as they operate at full capacity virtually from open to close. 

Rest assured.... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I gaurantee it.

Arigato!

{"text":"The presence of Imadake is their own testament to the trust they instill in the adventurous foodies in Montreal who crave authentic Japanese food that isn't raw, that their introduction will be well received. They are bold to plant a foot down as a freshman with a young concept in a rapidly growing food scene with confidence of being embraced. Thank you Imadake for bringing me a few of my most favorite dishes to Montreal and saving me gas money and 5 hour drive. This place is going to go viral, mark my words."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and a nice atmosphere but they are horrible for taking reservations during peak times. We made a reservation only to discover that they \"didn't have one\" for us when we got there. Perhaps it was terrible administration or the fact that they take reservations in the loudest part of the restaurant (at the front door). Severely disappointed considering we traveled a distance to be there."}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préférer par contre il y a beaucoup de bruit mais a part ça tout est parfait!"}
{"text":"A must check place in Montreal! the sake bombs are sooo fun and unique, definitely good idea, their other cocktails are also amazing, I tried hello kity and several other one i forgot the name but they were all delicious, comparable, maybe even better than the cocktails from 3 amigos. Their side dishes come in small portion and match well with the drinks. This place have a funky and urban atmosphere, owned by real japanese badass haha a must in montreal!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montreal hands down! As much as I love the cold raw fish entrees, the crispy chicken and fried burdock are a must at the table every single time (and I tend to avoid fried food, but these 2 are ammaaazingly yummy). The feel of the place is as charming as their staff and clientele. Love love love IMADAKE."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect here. The service was really fast and the staff were nice.I loved the environment."}
{"text":"Real Ramen is hard to come by in north America.
Montreal in particular has very little to offer.

When i heard about Imadake I went to give it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised.  Their Miso chashu men was actually quite good.

By far the best Ramen you can have in Montreal"}
{"text":"The place is next to the Atwater metro....very hip place to be. They have a great saki choice.  Menu is simple with pictures.  Raman is thru the roof with flavors."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to go with a big group of people to celebrate anything! The atmosphere is very playful with the lights being temporarily turned off throughout the night so that everyone can join in singing happy birthday and continuous rounds of sake bombs being enjoyed everywhere! We went with a group of about 10 people on a Thursday night and I found the service to be good and the food to be quite tasty. I really enjoyed the Tuna sashimi that was on there special house menu and the fact that you can get a litre of beer for a very reasonable price (but I of course forget what this price was :P). Eat. Drink. And be merry!"}
{"text":"The environment is very Japanese!! Everyone has the sake bomb!! its interesting!! but gets a little noisy!! but very fun environment! more of a rest bar setting!!

I like the food.. only con is that they come in such small portions that you end up spending an arm and a leg!! but the food it great!! love the ramen with pork belly! like the ice cream ball dessert... but its really really small... haha they have a japanese soft drink with a ball in it which is cool too!!"}
{"text":"I went there during lunch and got their okonomiyaki and takoyaki. The food took forever to arrive at our table and it wasn't really worth the wait. I would go again later in the day for a more authentic Izakaya experience. Not to self: try their sake bomb."}
{"text":"Looking for a Montreal Isakaya? it is THE PLACE to be. Been there numerous times and food is consistently in very stable standard.  

Cocktails are on the sweeter side. Beer and sake are great! 

Marinated and grilled cod, beef tongue and tuna tataki are my must haves. 

Took 1 star off because if you are late, lots of items will no longer be available. Kinda disappointing."}
{"text":"We went to this Japanese style pub on Saturday night and we unfortunately had to wait 20 minutes at our table before anyone took our order for drinks. This was frustrating considering part of the floor staff was not busy and just moved around without paying attention. We ordered multiple dishes and asked to have some served as appetizers to ensure we keep the most spicy ones for the end. Disappointedly, the dishes arrived out of order. For the good points, there is a large selection of sakes and other drinks at fair prices. The dishes are well presented and most are yummy without being exceptional. The venue is pretty big and can accommodate large groups with plenty of lengthy tables. All in all, this is a mixed bag and not among my favourite Izakayas. Would only go again for drinks or before seeing a movie at the nearby movie theatre."}
{"text":"Loud, fun, sapporo after sapporo. I had a great time here. The food was tasty but not particularly spectacular. 

Come for the fun atmosphere and put a bit of food in your belly after you've had a few drinks and I'm sure you'll be pleased with the experience!"}
{"text":"SUPER SUPER Fun!!!! LOUD
But a must try the food was very good!"}
{"text":"Point form:

- Ordered 6 dishes. Only received 5. Charged us for 6.
- Ordered water to accompany our drinks. Never saw a drop. 
- Cheap decor. Random baseball cap pinned to the wall. Seems like the roof is falling apart downstairs.
- Good selection of food. And the 5/6 we did receive were good.
- Had to ask for the bill 3 times. As I post this, I am still waiting for the bill...

Note: maybe this is better for lunch than dinner, but in general I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Incredible space and pretty good food. I've got to admit that the ambience in this place is electric - it's noisy and face-paced! One thing you can always count on is the constant banging of tables for the sake bombs. This place is great for groups or parties. The food is pretty good but not the best Japanese food that I've had in Montreal.

Go for the black cod, dumplings and shrimp! Avoid the noodles - they are nothing special and my group was slightly disappoint with their lack of flavour. 

SAKE SAKE SAKE GO GO GO"}
{"text":"with all the 5 Star rating this place got, i had to try it for myself...

First thing comes to mind when you visit this place, is whether or not it stands up to Kazu... my verdict? Naaaaaaah !!!! lol

On this point i agree with Concertina F. but whereas none of Kazu's dishes disapoint   SOME dishes at Imadake do... and this despite the damn lineup at kazu, their habit of constant price INFLATION, their limited menu, no fried items  and their cash only policy...

On to the food... :)
we had, ramen, beef tongue, chicken karaage, jelly fish salad, eel soup, eel omelet, agedashi tofu, bacon wrapped asparagus, and tempura.

of note is the beef tongue, quite delicious, tender and good flavor, I know I kissed a cow... And I liked it :P. The jelly fish salad was nice, refreshing, light and refreshing, except the portion was unforgivably small.

The rest was just all right nothing spectacular, one miss is the omelet, too much sugar, It's an omelet not flan!!! lol :P

Tempura was average, but really no one messes that one up... well except hot and spicy buffet, where it's as big as a celery stick and mostly batter lol.

chicken was good, but I like chicken karaage, so it was fine, but I've had better, at sumo ramen and ichiban. 

the eel soup was another miss, the dashi was weak, no flavor depth, but the eel was good.

The agedashi was good, good soy sauce dashi, and the tofu was silky.

The bacon asparagus was a bit on the bland side, a dash of teriyaki or miso would have been nice.

Final verdict? more style than substance, small dishes... but nice drinks."}
{"text":"What makes this place really stand out is the artwork/ambience, service, crazy tasty umami food, and the sake bombs!!!!  

Upon my friend's suggestion, we ordered the beef tataki, takoyaki (deep fried octopus), miso beef tongue, sea bass, and the dome salad, of course, with two sake bombs.  

The sea bass was simply buttery melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Definitely the best fish I had ever had in my life (and I'm Asian and eat fish regularly!).  The next best dish was the cow tongue, which looks nothing like the organ and is grilled to perfection with a delicate yet generous sprinkling of deep fried sweet potato.  The combination made my head explode!  The takoyaki was exceptionally good and is a definite must-try.  The dishes that were less memorable were the tataki, which was over-seasoned and made my mouth pucker (apparently it was better last time according to my friend), and the dome salad was just \"okay\".  The dessert was less impressive, as the cheesecake tasted like a giant square of philly cream cheese mixed with green tea.  Not bad, but definitely not something to write home about.

The sake bombs were definitely fun.  I'm not one for sake or shots, and my friend isn't one for beer, but we both LOVED them, and at 5 bucks a pop, it's worth it, if not only for the EXPERIENCE!  Yes!  I won't ruin the surprise so just ORDER it and see what happens...

Finally, for all those who like to compare Imadake with Kazu, I have to say that these two are complete worlds apart.  Imadake stands out on its own as a really fun hangout.  I'm already planning on bringing a group of friends here for a fun and tasty night out!"}
{"text":"Super resto japonais avec ces petites entrées succulentes et ses très bon plat! Mention spéciale pour le Ramen ;) en revanche si vous voulez faire un repas romantique, ce ne sera pas la bonne place!"}
{"text":"What a blast this place is! And the food offers up interesting twists and turns on all sorts of Japanese cuisine. Very yummy, I recommend the Gindara, Miso Marinated Grilled Black Cod. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are nice. Good response and definitely know what to do for special occasions. Cute waitresses and good food. What more can you ask for?

Highly recommend and be sure to make a reservation.

Drink as many saki bombs as you can take get the octopus and stone steak."}
{"text":"Japanese resto-bar with tasty tapas-style food and a side of rambunctious fun.

Imadake is a blast plain and simple.

Good for small or medium sized groups, it's a vivacious dining and drinking environment. It is a high-volume noise restaurant, in part just because of the dynamics of the actual interior design that seems to bounce around the echoes of conversations, in part due to the fact that as the night goes on the high-energy of the place becomes contagious and the civilised rowdiness is catching. the sake bomb shenanigans that is Imadake's schtick may have something to do with that as well. So yeah, you've been warned. It's loud. In a good way.

All of the dishes I've had there were tasty and the Green Tea Cheese Cake is a guaranteed mouthparty. I've been several times and still haven't tried everything. There's a solid variety of options for meateaters and vegheads alike. Because of the nature of the tapas-type dishes that encourage you to share it's definitely best had with friends and an affordable way to be satisfied without getting overstuffed.

Don't go here expecting a fancy-schmancy dinner or a good place for an intimate date, but bring a few friends and you will have a riot. The staff are friendly, fun and helpful, and service has always been speedy. Order Sake bombs. Just trust me... the staff go all out for those and it's cheesy good fun.

Non-vegatarian must-haves: Ashi chazuke with smoked salmon, yakitori, takoyaki, beef tataki with ponzu sauce

Vegetarians must-haves: the mushrooms, mixed vegetable tempura, goat cheese with raspberry maple syrup, green salad with ginger dressing, seaweed salad, vegetable gyoza dumplings, korokke, agedashi tofu

(I'm vegetarian so can recommend more of those options, but the meat recommends are based on my friends' reactions)

Only downside... the hard wood benches and seating made my badonkadonk fall asleep like I was sweating in a church pew again. But the Sake bombs helped me forget that too."}
{"text":"They've done a really nice update to their menu; there are now pictures for all items. Although ramen is still close to my heart, I have enjoyed making meals out of appetizers. Mochi egg rolls are delicious, veggie tempura is a generous amount (6-8 pieces), the chicken with wasabi mayo would be perfect if the pieces were a little more bite-size. Not a fan of the seafood pancake."}
{"text":"My favorite izakaya in Mtl. Ambience is noisy, but you only live once. Food is as good as it gets, service is quick but you're allowed to chill out (unlike at Kazu) and enjoy more and more food & drinks. Ingredients are top quality, prices are reasonable and you can see that the cooks put special care in every plate. Highly appreciated. YOLO and Sake Bombs!"}
{"text":"Spacious and no wait at 5:30pm. The waitress was helpful and I can tell the place is a great place to gather with friends. Food was yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Warm, festive atmosphere. Delicious food and friendly staff. Great service. Definitely worth making a reservation and most definitely worth an evening out. The menu is varied enough that there is something for everyone. Loved it, every time."}
{"text":"\"Disappointed\", \"underwhelming\", \"overpriced\" and \"over-sauced\" are all adjectives that came to mind while eating at Imadake. From reading earlier reviews here, I think we ordered all the right items (octopus balls, okonomiyaki, that fried chicken with wasabi mayo dish, jellyfish salad, black cod), but none of them were that great. The cod was rubbery, unlike at other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (for example, Azuma on St-Laurent had a wonderful black cod). The octopus balls were gummy with un-cooked tempura batter in the center and slathered in salty sauce. The okonomiyaki was so completely covered in sauce, that this was the only thing we could taste. That, and a strange, almost cornmeal-y consistency unlike any other okonomiyakis I've experienced (granted I've only had it once before, in NYC, but it was a wonderful streetfood-style dish there; here, not anything I'd recommend, even if you got the sauce on the side--which I would recommend doing, if you choose to try this dish). We didn't order anything to drink, and to the best of my knowledge, only ordered the five small dishes listed above, plus one order of mochi, and it cost us $67 before tip. I certainly won't be returning. I think this place is more about the scene, as it's got a trendy vibe to it; it's a trendy-slathered-in-oyster-sauce kind of place."}
{"text":"The food is very good. I recommend the shrimp tempura, it was delicious. Service is also pretty good. We had reservations on a Friday night, but had to wait about 20 minutes.  It was very crowded. They gave us complimentary drinks to make up for the wait, which I thought was a nice touch. Much better service than the Japanese style bar  on St-Laurent and Pine.

Will be going back for lunch or for dinner during the week. Make reservations if you plan to go on a weekend. Or don't go on the weekend if you want to avoid the twenty-something, boisterous bar crowd."}
{"text":"Super ambiance, bonne grillade et saké bomb !! Je vous le recommande chaudement pour vos soirées entre amis"}
{"text":"Really great food,just may be a lil too loud for conversations.Prices are excellent.I been to Japan and this izakaya comes very close to it.Ramen is one of the best in town.However,they have ran out of broth twice already in the past.Get there early!"}
{"text":"The best Okonomiyaki I've had since leaving Japan almost a decade ago, and the Korokke ( deep fried mash potato) is a must have. 

I cannot recommend this place strongly enough. If you love Japanese food and culture, you need to go as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Atwater is a quiet area and this is a good option if you want a beer and some small food items. 

The menu is not dazzling but nice. 

Recommended: Tuna tataki thing, chicken wings ($2 each  though), tendon in ponzu (good value)
Skip: octopus balls, skewers, ramen
Decent: mackerel (small and expensive but good), salads. 

Booze: limited choice, higher prices.

Ambiance: Great

Service: Very good

Parking: Good after 8 pm.

Basically, after a long day and when I'm in the hood this is a place for a cold Saporo and some meaty salty things to wash it down. There is no better place for a good few blocks."}

{"text":"Ain't no place in Montreal like this bar .More like A GREAT Izakaya--well known and situated downtown. 

Imadake is one of my favourite place to hit up on Friday / Saturday night to have a night filles with fun and .... SAKE of course. Although, I have various memorable nights and night I had forgotten.... Imadake will always have a certain place within my heart. It is my Izakaya in Montreal to party and enjoy drinks without any worries. 

Food is pretty decent--above average in term of quality. Price is somewhat are bit more expensive as they are usually serves in tapas format. 

However... they have a magnificent choices of boozes --plenty of sakes type and beer.Hey YELPS SAPORO + SAKE means one thing. ONE GREAT NIGHT OF FUN . 

Don't forget to try the house's drink the sake bomb as a mean to be part of the ambiance and the festivities that can result out of your experience. 

Lastly, service is great. This place can get very busy and crowed especially on Friday and Saturday . Be sure to reserve your places :) 
Nonetheless, I'm sure the nice and polite staff will help you have a memorable Izakaya as they really like people to come back. 

I really wish everyone a good time here and just enjoy the experience !"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has 4 stars. It was the best food ever!!!!! I personally don't like shrimp tempura only because it's so heavy but the way they make it at Imadake it's light and perfect!! Also had the steak and that was delicious. Their sauces for the salad to the steak to just every dish is so tasty they need to sell their sauces separately because I would love to take some home! They also had the bust customer service! They allowed us to keep our stroller next to us while our 7 month old joined us. #loveMTLfood"}
{"text":"Everything is great. Dont sleep on the ramen its top notch. Beware of loud sake bomb routines."}
{"text":"When I say Sake, you say BOMB!

Sake, BOMB!
Sake, BOMB!
Sake, BOMB!

Pound the table and drink!

The rainbow sake bomb is a shot falling into a bigger shot falling into beer, that's three deep!  My sake bomb just got Inception-ed!

Sapporo on tap!  Now what's not to love?

I had the yakiika (grilled cuttlefish), gindara (miso marinated, grilled black codfish), jellyfish salad, and karaage (chicken with wasabi aioli).  All were delicious and highly recommended!

This place has a great atmosphere and fills up quick!  Make reservations if you can and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been curious about ramen in MTL but never seem to get around to trying any whenever I visit. It was freezing the other day and I wanted something soupy. I thought of Korean but wasn't sure if there is any good Korean food in MTL so I decided on Imadake, across the street from Alexis-Nihon.

I was in a bit of a rush so we didn't have time to drink and draw out the meal beyond the time it took us to eat, so we didn't get to try any of their cocktails or other drinks, but they had a number of items on their fairly extensive menu that I would not have minded (their online menu is slightly different). I was also glad to see black cod present but I didn't end up ordering it as I hadn't yet tried anything at Imadake and if the fish wasn't done right, I would have been really disappointed! There were the usual izakaya staples: salads, grilled skewers of meat/skin/cartilage, gyoza, takoyaki, okonomiyaki & other fried items, dessert, etc. but what we really wanted was ramen.

Imadake offers about 4-5? choices of ramen where you choose the broth type: miso or \"original\", which I don't know if that's shoyu (soy sauce) or shio (salt) but there was no mention of tonkotsu anywhere on the menu; and then you select flavours: miso with pork belly (~$11) and miso grilled garlic ($12?) ramens were what we ordered, along with grilled mackerel (~$10), and then I watched the guys behind the counter throwing it all together. There was one working on the presentation of dishes that were done before ours and really getting into the placing of the garnishes, all intense-looking.

The mackerel came out as two pieces and was grilled nicely, with the edges all crispy. Not overly flavourful but definitely didn't have the fishy taste that mackerel often comes with. I didn't try the grilled garlic ramen but my miso pork belly was just OK. There were no sprouts in sight, nor anything with crunch, which there should have been. The pork belly was too thin and small (only one piece; I wonder how much you get with the \"extra pork belly order\" for $2 more?), and we both agreed that the broth wasn't terribly flavourful. The noodles were springy but very slightly undercooked. The egg wasn't soft boiled and runny, which is good because I don't like them that way anyhow, even though that's how it's supposed to be done. I wasn't sure if the place is Japanese or Chinese-owned so I had no idea what I'd get when I asked for \"something hot\" to add to our ramens to liven up the broth. We got those chili pepper flakes in oil that you get in Chinese restos, which did the job. 

I don't think anyone who works there is over the age of 25, and they all seemed professional. There are a lot of staff which is probably quite useful as I could see Imadake being busy most nights. Service was great, very friendly and attentive, among them a couple of actual Japanese waitresses! 

I haven't been to other ramen-ya or izakayas in Montreal but the ones in Toronto have been mostly mediocre at best with few exceptions. I don't know what the MTL standard for these types of places is but I would go back to Imadake to try other items. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but based on this one time, I'd bump this place up by another half *."}
{"text":"Miso marinated cod.  If three words could ever tell a complete story, you just read them.  So rich, buttery and sweet, this 12 dollar plate is an amazing value.  Talk is cheap... Imadake is inexpensive.   Eat here, drink here.   Be happy."}
{"text":"Ok, this place can officially be nominated for the best restaurant in Montreal for both unique, creative, zesty doffs and drinks + outstanding ambiance with crazy vibe 

So if you have never been there, you're missing out big time.

Let me mention it's usually crowded and very noisy, and the pricing is not cheap but worth trying for sure :)"}

{"text":"Always and consistently delicious. A little loud, but a great atmosphere and service. A must for any lover of Japanese pub food."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. Our waitress perfect, smily, helpful and fast to serve us. Food is ok. Tasty. But not remarkable. Drinks are good. Sake bombs had a spicy touch to the night.

Make sure you reserve, and in our case make sure to verify they have put you on the list of reservation... Which we were not, and we were 10!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 3 years now and it has yet to disappoint me. The staff is nice and attentive, the food is absolutely delicious. Highlights include the spicy miso ramen with porc, the takoyaki (octopus balls), the goat cheese and the green tea cake."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The garlic ramen was the best. The ika (squid) was grilled a little too long so it was a tad burnt. The black cod was delightfully sweet."}
{"text":"The environment is clean and you can enjoy the meal in a cozy atmosphere?But the main dish is pretty small and taste is not that good as I thought. A quite expensive for eating full?"}
{"text":"- good staff, although they work so fast that end up taking off your food from the table before you finish it. 
- place has a strong smell of food. Your clothes will get that smell.
- Good location
- very loud place
- women restroom wasn't very clean
- food is very good! I would recommend deep fried goat cheese, okonomiyaki, ebi mayo, takoyaki. 
- very pricey! 

Tip: make a reservation before arriving there."}

{"text":"A must go place to enjoy with friends.The food is delicious but you have to be very prepared to pay for that. I liked most plates that I ordered except for the smoke salmon soup. The best one so far were the Ebimayo and Takoyaki (fried octopus)"}
{"text":"I like how imadake makes it feel like authentic Japanese restaurant however the experience I got was a little disappointed,  it was a busy day with a rowdy crowds everywhere so service was lacking while I had a increasing headache . The food presentation was very nice , taste was satisfying ."}
{"text":"So I heard a LOT about this place before finally being able to make it. I don't know if my expectations were simply too high but I was underwhelmed.

I went with some of my best girlfriends and we still have a good time - but the experience was just not 5 stars.

Menus were kinda... grubby? Some of the plates we shared were good, the black cod was outstanding... But others were so average. The salad (I think it was sesame?) was pretty sad. The fried veggies were just disappointing - sure, they're big pieces but some chunks were undercooked. I actually bit on a soggy piece at some point wahhhhh. Thankfully washed it out with a swig of ginger beer. Tried the veggie dumplings as well; ok, but nothing that exciting.

Drinks were actually a strong point. There were a bunch of Japanese-themed cocktails (I liked the Tokyotini) and of course, sake (and whiskey!).

So I would say this place is good for a party with a group of friends, or even for celebrating your birthday (they do this cool thing where they turn off the lights and bring you cake; happened 3 or 4 times over the course of the evening). Most people go for the sake bombs. But to me, the novelty kinda wore off after the first time we ordered a round.

Also, some things to keep in mind (deal-breakers for me): this place gets LOUD, so much so that I had a hard time hearing my friend sitting across the table. Also, restrooms were NOT clean... And you know what that usually says about the kitchen :("}
{"text":"Today's lunch service was exceptional, we ordered the amazing Okonomiyaki Poutine from La Poutine Week special, as well as the Gyuu-Dan from their new lunch menu.

The poutine was loaded with seafood, and tasted amazing.

Come over at night for the SAKE BOMB!"}
{"text":"My family loved it here - young and old!  You walk in and it looks like a typical Japanese izakaya place - a trendy bar type of decor.

As soon as we sat down and ordered drinks, I ordered my son's ramen.  The waiter came back to get our order, and was honest in telling us that we probably ordered too much (my husband walked in hungry and over -ordered!). He very patiently helped us to narrow down our order, and it turned out to be a perfect amount for us.  Our food came out as soon as each dish was ready and it worked out very well for us - especially the ramen that came out early for my toddler.  Here's what we had:

- my son's pork belly ramen with original broth (made with meat bones) - a very good, rich broth with chewy noodles, very tasty pork and bamboo shoots, and bean spouts.  There was a delicious looking half of an egg in there too but my son ate it all so I cannot testify as to how good it was.
- the special dish of soba noodles wrapped in seaweed with (tempura?) shrimp inside, and the whole thing was fried.  This was an unusual dish, but it surprised me because I loved it, especially with the sauce it was served with.
- sea bass marinated in miso for three days - YUM.  You must order this.
- my black sesame seed ice cream was THE BEST of it's kind I've ever had.  It's opaque black, not the weak looking versions I've tried at home. As my dad said in Chinese, \"it's very fragrant\", which means the flavor is very good.  You must also order this...!

All of the following were delicious small plates that we'd order again:
- beef cooked on a hot stone
- skewered chicken
- skewered chicken with plum sauce
- skewered sausage
- grilled squid
- vegetable tempura

This place served us a great parting dinner in the form of many small and delicious plates to share.  If we lived in Montreal, I can tell you that my husband and I would be regulars here."}
{"text":"Oh boy hein ! Quand on s'y attend pas, on reste surpris !

Gang Bang de bouffe, de bière et de Sake Bomb sont au rendez-vous chez Imadake. La place était full un vendredi soir alors que nous célèbrions un anniversaire. C'est l'fun de changer de cadre un peu, tsé le St-Hubert ça a fait son temps! La bouffe est malade, le tataki de boeuf et les soupes ramen ont volé mon coeur. Les nouilles al dente (j'sais pas trop comment on dit ça en japonais la), ont fait de la soupe un souper dont je me souviendrai longtemps. 

** gare aux sensibles au bruit. Ca crie fort ! mais c'est ben ben l'fun ! :)"}
{"text":"Loved the spicy ramen (I do like dense and thick) and beef tataki; hated the music. Sake bomb is annoying. I would go back on Mondays just for the ramen and -overpriced- tataki if wanted to entertain my significant other, but they close the kitchen so early that I will probably not come back just for small Japanese tapas. I'd rather go to Kinka."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food. If you order sake bombs the waiter yells sakae and you bomb amd on the 4th count you tap de table and the sake falls. Its really fun, but i've had better japanese food at other japansese restaurants downtown such as kynoya izakaya or kazu. All in all is fun to go here"}
{"text":"Imadake is pretty awesome. The vibe is great; it's very busy and cheerful and perfect for pregaming or a birthday party. We went as a group of 6 before a hockey game and it was great. The staff is personable, the food is really tasty and varied, and it's a fun place to be in. One thing I have to say is I felt like there were a lot of fried things but it is a Japanese pub and stays pretty true to that. It's not a slew of health conscious snacks but it's fun, tasty, relatively cheap, and has a lot of good cocktails."}
{"text":"I'd been to Imadake a few times shortly after they had opened (yes back when they were called Godzilla's) and thought that the restaurant was good but nothing special. I had dinner there with some friend on Sunday evening and I was very pleasantly surprised. Imadake has really come into its own. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this as the place was packed on a Sunday evening. Based on the crowd you would have thought that it was Friday night. The atmosphere was fun and lively the service was good and not overbearing and the food was terrific. As I'm writing this I'm wondering why I'm giving Imadake 4 and not 5 stars, but it feels like the right rating.  

The menu and the food has matured since I first ate there. There are many great options on the menu, the food is fresh and tasty and the presentation is good. 

Many of the reviews compare Imadake to Kazu. I guess this is a natural thing to do as they are both Japanese restaurants in the same part of town at similar price points. However, I think that this is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison as these are two very distinct restaurants with there own approach to Japanese cuisine and each offer a very different experience. They are certainly not interchangeable. Now that I've thought about Kazu (a definitive 5 star restaurant) I know why I was comfortable with a 4 star rating for Imadake. 

Imadake is a great restaurant where you'll have a fun time and enjoy some great (and reasonably priced) food.  Enjoy an evening with some friend and be sure to order the Saki Bomb."}
{"text":"Another disappointment! $60 per person and probably the worst Izakaya I've tried!  I don't think there was one dish that comes to mind that was good. At the end you're just eating to get full because you know you spent so much money on bad food. The beef tongue was pretty good but every other dish was just not good. 

The soft shell crab was soggy from the oil and not crispy; the beef on the hot stone slab was bland (and the sauce that came with it was nasty); the sausage was ok; deep fried chicken with wasabi mayo (way too much wasabi and tasted water down); beef slices with some ginger sauce (ginger sauce was gross).

I would say the worst was the Ramen. Bland soup and it still had the flour dough taste from the noodles. Disgusting! It looks amazing then once you taste it you want to throw up!

I don't know if it's because their chef is a really old asian guy. I think he needs to retire because his taste buds were off.

It should be a 1.5 star rating just because they had the beef tongue dish but not enough for 2 stars

Yelpers, once again you disappoint with your ratings!"}
{"text":"Yoo i really fucks with the noods here jah feel,woulda got a 5 star but meh ain't nobody perfect.whoa that's deep for a yelp review."}
{"text":"Meh. Tables are extremely cramped and food is only ok. Karaage and burdock were yummy but the other things we ordered were lackluster. It was very loud in there and the woman next to me who was about 2 feet away was cackling like a witch, not the restaurants fault but as I said it is very cramped."}
{"text":"Young vibe, NOT a place for babies. Unfortunately the girls at the front were much too nice to tell us that over the phone, so when we arrived a dozen patrons in their early twenties looked shocked out of their pants as they took in the sight of us with a stroller, carseat, and oversized diaper bag. Oh right and a squawking 5 month old. 

Determined to let not this faze us (and because honestly it took so much effort and walking to get there), we still had dinner. Fortunately it was SO loud at this place, no one could hear my son and he somehow managed to fall asleep despite the loud music and groups banging on the table shouting SAKE BOMB! This meant my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner! 

We ordered five tapas style plates including a buttery black cod, steak, and wasabi chicken. All the dishes we tried were really good, but fall short of the 5 star mark. 

Try the ramune- a carbonated Japanese non-alcoholic drink which comes in a very interesting and quite genius bottle. Ot tastes like many chemicals I don't want to ask about, but try it anyway for fun."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum! This place is always a good time!

I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.

The food is great, ambience is really cool, and sake bombs are hilarious.

The prices are very decent for lunch, but I've never been here for dinner so I can't vouch for that.

In any case, definitely give it a try if you can but make a reservation! This place is tiny and always packed to the max. I've also heard that weekend nights here kick butt so try it out and let me know if that's true! :)"}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préférés.

Menu varié qui chance occasionnellement. Je n'ai pas été impressionné par les ramens, c'était bon, mais je préfère partager les autres plats de poissons ou de tataki de buf sur le menu qui sont excellents. Même chose pour la langue.

Une des rares places qui offre le Silver sake de gekkeikan, mon préféré de ce qui est offert à Montréal. 

Le service est rapide et courtois. 

Peut-être un peu trop bruyant pour une soirée romantique, mais très bien pour une soirée festive. 

Beaucoup mieux que le biiru cote nourriture à mon avis."}
{"text":"SAKE BOMB!

Imadake is good food, fun especially with friends. 

Hung out there for the first time with a bunch of friend and well came away with the same experience. 

The food was fresh and well priced. 

The drinks were yummy and the on tap Sapporo was super refreshing. 

Next time I go I'm trying the ramen it looked awesome as it passed me by. 

Overall Imadake was full of life and good japanese eats. 

Can't wait to go again! 

Pro Tip: If you are there with a group of friend get a round of sake shots . Shake bombs to be specific... you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Simply very good... Try, and you wouldn't regret a bit. Quite authentic too... Try black cod; it's a sure must..."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe! Ambiance festive ( sera trop  brouillant  pour un souper de couple ). Belle liste de sake. Il faut essayer la morue noire et les dumpling."}
{"text":"My favorite Izakaya in town. Sake bomb is a must try. Noodles are good if you are hungry. My friends and I weren't very hungry so we just ordered some appetizer: takowasa, edamame, goat cheese and fried burdock. Loved all of them! I also loved the atmosphere here. Everyone was shouting sake bomb. Everyone seemed so happy. I was so happy :)"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!  Place was packed which is always a good sign, during our wait the staff was very polite and the meal was really worth the wait.  10/10 would do it again."}
{"text":"I came out of Imadake feeling like a blimp. The emergency lights were going off as this blimp was having problems walking to his car. I was stuffed. I obviously tried one too many items on the menu and I can only blame my gluttony for that. 

What I liked the most at Imadake was the freshness of the ingredients. You can tell they select good ingredients for their dishes and that, to me, shows a high level of dedication to not only their food but also their customers. Ingredients are probably the easiest place to cut costs but that is definitely not going on at Imadake as each element feels and tastes like it was made and sourced on the same day.

I tried the miso ramen with butter corn and both the potato and corn korroke (the latter is what sent this blimp into overloaded territory). I especially loved the korrokes and would go back to Imadake if only to have them again. Perfect frying. Perfectly crispy, light batter. Delicious. If you go there you need to have both.

The ramen was above average when it comes to Montreal fare based on the handful of others I have tried (I have yet to try Kazu's since they only serve it during weekday lunches). Noodles were good. Broth had a rich buttery taste and deep well rounded flavors. Toppings are a bit on the low side as a default so I suggest adding extras and definitely ask for chili to add to it as it rounds out the flavors very nicely.

Ambiance is what you'd expect from this type of establishment. It's loud - personally, not my thing but it certainly adds a buzz to the experience. 

Service was reasonably good. More like a pub type of service. Expect the waiters to place their whole arm across your face while filling your glass of water instead of going on the other side of the table. The type of stuff only some people would notice and by some people I mean people like me who are probably quite picky about service. They're certainly nice enough and the service was quick but it's important to keep your expectations in check when it comes to the details. It is what it is.

Overall I can definitely recommend Imadake. They serve tasty / fresh food. Nuff said? 

Vegetarian food: 4 Hindenburgs out of 5
Service: 3.5 Arms in yo face out of 5
Value: 4.0"}
{"text":"Belle place, mais j'ai l'impression que le resto a pris un coup de vieux ! Les plats etait bien et le service etait bon , mais il manquait un petit quelque chose. 

Il y a plusieurs restaurant de ce genre à Montreal et je ne suis pas pret à dire que celui ci se démarque!"}
{"text":"Imadake started the Izakaya boom in Montreal back around 2011, but in my opinion they've recently been bested by Kinka.

Trendy, loud, always busy and usually featuring several sexy Japanese and Korean waitresses. Keep in mind that the serving staff really think they're hot shit. On my recent visits I found them not particularly friendly or engaging, instead they're just sort of prideful and even a little douchey. 

In terms of food, if you want to sample pretty much exactly what authentic izakayas in Japan serve, this is it. From the takoyaki to the okonomiyaki to the takowasa, to the kara age... It's all authentic and delicious.

They also have a house special known as the sake bomb. I don't remember much aside from blasting a few and singing, one thing leading to another and waking up the next morning next to a beautiful girl from Shizuoka. Just go with the flow man.

Keep in mind that if you're actually hungry and not just nibbling this place has always set me back $60 when all is said and done. Be warned, it's not cheap.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The main problem with Imadake is that it will always be compared to Kazu. And while both Kazu and Imadake are Japanese isakayas, they are actually quite different. Kazu is the homey, cozy, authentic older brother, while Imadake is the trendy yet eager kid sis.

Being greeted by a chorus of \"Irasshaimase!!!\" by the employees immediately reminds you of Kazu, however, being greeted so enthusiastically is cute and kind of works at Kazu because the place is so small, it's almost like walking into someone's home. Imadake however is a much larger space, so that kind of yelling seems... kind of crazy? The staff isn't all Japanese either, which makes it seem inauthentic and a tad contrived.

Okay, I'm obviously moderately fond of Kazu, but I'm going to stop comparing them now. Publicly anyway.

So the evening began when my friend and I both ordered Sapporos. Sapporos that turned out to be so large that we could have filled a small swimming pool with what arrived at our table. Hey, I'm not complaining! There's no such thing as too much beer. Except that time in 1999, but that's another story.

We decided to order a few small dishes because it's always more fun that way. First came the Japanese style fried chicken, which was actually a freebie because the kitchen had made it by mistake. I wouldn't have ordered this on my own because it just doesn't sound that interesting to me, but it was pretty good.

The dishes we actually ordered came after. Grilled beef tongue, pork belly brochette, octopus balls (takoyaki), some kind of whitefish carpaccio, black cod, and jellyfish salad. The tongue was fantastic, as was the jellyfish salad and carpaccio. The takoyaki is the type of dish for me that is died-and-gone-to-heaven upon the first bite, and as you continue, your body slowly begins to tell you that you can take no more. Maybe it's all that mayo sauce or something, but by the end of it I was kind of glad it was over. Am I alone on this?

The biggest disappointment was the pork belly. When I think of pork belly, I think \"bursting with juicy flavour\" and \"layers of sweet heavenly pork fat\". What we got was a plate of skimpy, dry and flavourless skewers. Not impressed.

Dessert was green tea cheesecake. I'm not sure why we ordered this, since my companion isn't a cheesecake fan. But who cares. More for me!

So... I lied when I said I was going to stop comparing this place to Kazu. Sort of. What I want to get across is that if Kazu didn't exist, or I had never been, Imadake would be The Spot. It generally has all the qualities I like about a restaurant. Cool, casual vibe, fun small portions, nice space, good food, simple yet creative (at least creative in the sense that we don't have many isakayas in Montreal, so we don't see these types of dishes often), etc. However, Kazu DOES exist, and while only one of Imadake's dishes was a real disappointment, none of Kazu's are. 

I'll definitely be back to Imadake... on days where I don't feel like waiting forever for a table at Kazu, or on a day when I want to be able to relax over drinks with a bunch of friends without feeling cramped or rushed. But for any other day, Kazu has my heart."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's bachelor party this past weekend after reading the Yelp reviews. I made a reservation less than a week in advance for 18 and they happily accommodated us. 

Food is on point, good for sharing and hogging alike.  Drinks, the sake bombs especially, are legit.  We avoided the specialty cocktails as our waitress said they were very sweet, but the beers and run-of-the-mill cocktails (jack and coke, gin and tonic, etc.) were nice. 

Waitresses were in plaid skirts which, for a bachelor party of 18 was... Well, y'know. 

Don't think a single one of us had a complaint about the food, drinks, or service.  Oh, and they were nice enough to split our enormous bill for each of us based on what we ordered! 

Great time, highly recommended!"}

Cow tongue was delicious
Great Bar and Drinks, great place for a birthday Party or a first date"}
{"text":"We came here at a recommendation of a friend, upon walking in, it is quit the full house for dinner on a Saturday night, so we were seated at the bar. There is not a formal coat check (it's self-hang), and you can put your coat in the front. 

FOOD: We got the takoyaki, karaage, chicken skin, unagi rice soup, and green tea cream cheese cake. Imadake definitely has fast service once the ball gets rolling as they have to meet the demand of so many people getting sake bombs and what not. I settled with a Tokyotini, which was very strong. Thanks for not holding back! The food overall was on par. Hot and straight from the kitchen. I think my favorite was the chicken skin and karaage. Well seasoned and warm, so nothing to complain about. The cake was more cream cheese than green tea though. 

SERVICE: A bit slow at first, but it did pick up. There were several birthdays going on at Imadake, so that would slow down service a bit. Overall courteous and efficient! 

Recommendation: Make a reservation, if you do not want to sit at the bar!"}
{"text":"Must go! Love this place! Great food! Amazing atmosphere.

This place is hip, fun and a cool urban spot everyone must check out in MTL.
Food is great. A lot of their food is Cooked on a charcoal grill and has amazing, full flavors. Its tapas style so you can order a lot of smaller dishes and taste test a bunch of different things!
Its asian fusion so you would have to like those kind of flavors to enjoy the food to its fullest.

Great urban decor, and this place has an upbeat, party kind of vibe. Great for birthday groups, but maybe not so much for a first date. It is VERY loud, some people might find it bothersome. But if you are lame and don't like to have a good time when you go out, stay home and order in, this place won't be for you. Going in a group is best. Or as a couple if you are down to have a couple drinks and let loose. Service is a bit slow sometimes, it is always at full capacity with reservations and walk ins. I suggest Strongly to make a reservation.
They have a private party room that fits up to 30 people you can reserve if you are a huge group, there is a MASSIVE TV in their so you can watch the game if you wanted. (only tv in the restaurant is in the private room)

All in all, I give Imadake 5 stars because I believe it's a MUST check out spot that I would guarantee people enjoy. Foods good (3.5-4 stars), fair prices, fun atmosphere!

Cheers"}
{"text":"This place blows me away every time I come here! Among my usual orders that include the ebimayo, takoyaki, and karaage, this evening my friends and I also ordered the grapefruit and dungeness crab salad that was absolutely amazing, as well as the tsukune that was grilled to perfection. The salad had a great a balance between the citrus and crab, while the tsukune (mix of pork and chicken) just melts in your mouth. Make sure you order them next time, you will not be disappointed!

Being a fairly large group, we of course ordered a few large sake bombs... we started off with regular ones, and topped off the night with large rainbow sake bombs. In between, we had a few pints of sapporo that are served on tap.

This place never disappoints, the more people the merrier... so come one, come all!"}
{"text":"Been there twice, love it! The ambiance was greatly fun, loud music and the service is so friendly"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite japanese izakaya! The ambiance is very energetic and perfect a group hangout. They offer a decent amount of choices of ramen, deep fried and grilled food. Everything I've tried is always on point. Their large selection of sake and cocktails is for sure some of the best I've had. Also, you must try their sakebomb! Very fun if you are a group and everyone orders a sakebomb."}
{"text":"It is easy to miss this izakaya spot, because it has no sign on top, but rather only in the window. Space inside is dark, but staff are efficient and friendly. The food is excellent. We tried the fried squid, spinach salad, steak grilled on hot stone and pork ramen. Everything was good, but the steak and ramen were the best. The broth for the ramen was a bit salty, but other than that everything was top notch. The steak is amazingly tender and they season it perfectly, because you also dip it into a shoyu dipping sauce. Prices are average for downtown."}
{"text":"One of my faves in Montreal. Lively, fun and good food. Service fast and efficient. It's often busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I called one day before to make a reservation. However, when I got there, they didn't have my reservation (even if I had to give my credit card number). Luckily, the problem was quickly solved and they gave us a table.

I can confidently say that their drinks/cocktails are amazing. We pretty much ordered every drink/cocktail on the menu and were very pleased with all of them. However, they are a bit expensive for the amount we get (most are 9$).

We came to Imadake for the drinks, beer and the Sake bomb (a must-try!) but the waitress told us we had to order something to eat since it's a restaurant. I ordered takoyaki and was quite impressed. However, the portions are quite small since it is mainly tapas. It can get expensive if you have a big appetite or are very hungry.

Despite having a ton of tables, our waitress managed to give us a great service. She was very transparent and funny and also helped us for our orders. 

Overall, I would come back for the drinks and the loud and vivid atmosphere and the good service although it can get quite expensive (this is coming from a student's perspective)."}

Je vous conseille de réservé d'avance, car la place ce rempli très vite! Amusez-vous guys!!"}
{"text":"This place has always been my favourite, I remember the first time I came here and it was such an experience on its own. You have gorgeous art work fun Staff & huge chalk board downstairs and not to mention sake bombs!

I've had times that I've come and it's been packed and only once like today were we the only ones in the restaurant that's because we came at 5 on the dot. Loved being the only ones but also missed the atmosphere of everyone cheering and laughing.

Food came super quick and super tasty. There so many different options but a few of my favs are the seaweed salad and the shrimp with octopus balls. Can't go wrong with those 3. Great thing about this place is that it's small tapas style plates so you aren't stuck with a huge plate if you don't like it. The price is right. 

I've had a lot of ups with this place and very few downs only when it's to packed when you try to just walk in off the street but it's understandable because i love it too ! 

Explore the menu they have great options :)"}
{"text":"I'll give 4 stars, because I always have a great time.... Rainbow bombs!! They don't have a great Veggie, choice. Good for late night snacks and saki bombs.
It can get pretty loud and hectic, small place, very busy."}
{"text":"Very different, tapas or dim sum style Japanese cuisine. Nice industrial decor, get noisy. Need a reservation as it fills up fast. The server wasn't very informative, so you have to be adventurous and not totally know what you're eating"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and it was a fantastic experience. We went on saturday night, so we made sure to make a reservation, since I had heard it gets pretty full (which it does). They have a nice menu of japan themed cocktails (I had the \"Dragon ball\") and a nice assortment of dishes to share around the table. Everything was well priced, between 6-15 dollars. Everything we ordered was delicious, I recommend starting with the takoyaki :)

Other reviews say it's too loud, but I didn't find the noise level to be above normal resto-pub standards. We had no trouble hearing each other. The service was very quick and friendly. Even when they forgot one of our desserts, they gave us four free sake bombs to compensate. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Very japanese environment! The fried chicken is very good! The wasabi mayonnaise is super good! Also the dessert is excellent. I had the redbean riceball one. The cocktail is special and creative. I will come back!"}
{"text":"I like this place. yet I don't like this place. I give it three stars because of a few things I noticed that I really didn't like. But first, let's talk about the positive:

Cocktails are very good and cheap ($8). I had the Hello Kitty which is guava/lime juice etc and it tasted like a smoothie. My friend had a lychee martini and that was good too. Tofu salad was small but packed a punch. It was crispy, delicious, and whatever sauce they put in it was amazing. I really enjoyed the seaweed salad too.

Now the negative:

I did not appreciate the hot and cold service. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. But on the other hand, the waiter that served me my drink was super cold and did not even give me eye contact.  He came back again the second time. and again did not give any eye contact. nor smile. nor did he say anything. Maybe he wasn't a waiter. maybe he was a busser? It doesn't matter. You should still at least LOOK at your customer.  

Second negative point, the ramen was not available to order. Basically it wasn't ready yet. I think when you open your doors to the public, your ramen should be made available. I thought it was quite unprepared of them to not have something like a main dish ready to serve. 

I'd go again to try other dishes and for drinks maybe. But that's a maybe."}
{"text":"The food was nice, service was ok, price was fair. Overall a good experience but not ranking as one of my favourite Japanese places in Montreal. Has vegetarian options but not ramen."}
{"text":"The price was fair and the service was excellent. However they should rename this restaurant Sesame Street as they put sesame on everything."}
{"text":"I've mentioned this a 100 times but I'm not a drinker. 
So this time around I came here with Adam and his co-workers. They all felt like Sake Bombs. 
I didn't know what a Sake bomb was before this trip.
After trying them, I can indeed concur that they are awesome! 
It's so cool to slam the table and see all the cups of alcohol slip into each other. 

Our waitress the first time around was Ashely and she's the best. She knew I didn't like beer so she gave me a \"pikachu\" bomb instead which is a fruit juice base but still a sake shot at the top. Less alcohol and tastes a bit better. Ashley was really friendly. She served us quickly and drank a bit with us. 

The second time we had jimmy serve us and he was great too! He drank with us, gave us some free shots, the whole works. 

I thought that buying food in order to be able to drink was going to be an inconvenience but not that much. You can't order any of the under 5$ stuff but everything above works. 

Some options of 5$ meals that you can get to start drinking are: egg rolls with cheese and ham, vegetable dumplings, and ice cream (yes! Ice cream counts). 

The food is pretty good. I've had the ramen, chicken skewers, calamari, tempura shrimp, asparagus and bacon skewers, vanilla ice cream, and the vegetable dumplings. 
The only thing I didn't like was the calamari. They are very rubbery. Don't get those. 

Renu is the name of the owner and he's a very funny, likeable, and cool person. He welcomes you with a big smile on his face and makes sure everything is going well with your party. 

This place has quickly become one of my favourites and totally worth going to."}
{"text":"This classic Izakaya was quite authentic. With the sapporo beer on tap - get the 1 litre!

We tried a few dishes, here are my comments:

- seaweed salad: the chef recommended seaweed salad was odd. It was a cross between dried seaweed and vermicelli noodle. It was very salty, make sure to have it with another main dish. It does cleanse the palate.
- Yuzu chicken: It's fried chicken, the batter however isn't tempura, it's rice cracker... Nothing special. The chicken was tender inside the crispy outside.
- Beef on hot stone: best dish of the evening. It was beautifully marinated and fresh. And how cool is cooking raw beef on a super hot stone? The sauce was too much. It was really salty. Try it without first.
- Oyster mushroom ramen with original sauce: It was ok. Ramen was nicely done at al-dente but the broth lacked sophistication really. It lacked purity in its flavour. I would have assumed a clear broth but it was murky... Maybe try it with miso next time?

As they say \"toriaezu biru!!!!!!!!\" (with feeling people)

And sit at the bar if you don't mind the heat... it's pretty nifty chatting with the staff and watching the food as it gets plated."}
{"text":"Definitely a place that my partner and I will be going to when we come back to Montreal!

As soon as you step in, the atmosphere is impressive. The fixtures and modern, yet traditional furniture and walls are exciting to look at. My partner and I were very fixated on the beautiful murals on the walls. The staff did a good job. Water was refilled promptly most of the time. Best thing - the inside smelled like barbeque. My partner and I could barely hold on because we were so hungry. 

The main star was the food. Amazing, amazing food. We had the beef tataki, seaweed salad, pork belly, takoyaki, chicken skin, goat cheese, tuna cutlet and daikon kimchi (a special). 

The beef tataki was simply delicious. I really loved the way the flavours complemented each other. The tataki was tender. 

The seaweed salad had a very nice sesame dressing on it that was creamy. Loved how the seaweed was actually good portions of seaweed, not the usual stringy stuff they give you. 

The porky belly was a bit lacklustre. It was barbequed nicely but it barely had any flavour on it. Needed more marination. Or sauce on the side. 

The takoyaki stole the show. It certainly beat the quality of the takoyaki at one of my favourite places in the GTA. So crispy and well cooked. 

The chicken skin was amazing. I could eat a bowl of this any time. Crispy and well seasoned. 

The goat cheese was complemented well with the berry sauce. One of my favourites. 

The tuna cutlet was unique and tasty. Reminded me of home because of a certain herb used in Vietnamese culture. 

The daikon kimchi was good but it lacked that certain something. Perhaps more fermentation  and sour notes could have been improved on. 

Overall, a really good experience in a more modern izakaya. We left with our bellies full! Super full!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Montreal for two years and have lived in Japan for a year and a half. this is DEFINITELY the best, most authentic izakaya I have found. The food is exactly like I remembered it, the service is great and the prices are decent. The drinks are a little pricey but it is absolutely worth it for the atmosphere and the authentic food. 

So many food items are a must have, but I highly recommend the takoyaki (tiny pieces of octopus in a dumpling ball with a salty sauce) even if you're not a fan of seafood it is a delight!

The spicy ramen was equally delicious with the perfect cook on the boiled egg in it. Yummy spicy broth-y egg-y goodness! I wanted to eat 3 more bowls!

Their okonomiyake ( Japanese \"pancake\") was good, I'm used to the Hiroshima version which has noodles underneath but you could REALLY taste the pickled radish it it and it was delicious.

With echoes of Sake BOMB in the background, this place is great if you're looking for genuine Japanese izakaya food. Make sure to write your thanks on the chalkboard wall downstairs :)

GOCHISOUSAMA DESHITA!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food is very hard to find in Montreal.   This is a great place for ikazaya style and ramen.  There spicy ramen is definitely spicy and unique.  So far the best ramen noodles in Montreal. My other favorites include deep fried gobo, or burdock.   The waitress all wear anime style school uniforms.... Fun place for group."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. I loved the variety of food and drink items offered. The takoyaki/all items tasted deeeeeelish paired with a refreshing kirin beer.

2. The restaurant looks like a cave/den in a good way! I liked the industrial feel of the place. 

OVERALL:
-Go with a group and order lots of dishes to try everything they got!
-Great place to try Asian beers/hard alcohol with pairing food. 
-Perfect for group outings."}
{"text":"The place present itself has a Japanese pub and I did enjoy my meal there. Having been to a few authentic ones in Japan I felt a bit underwhelm... still a nice addition to the restaurant scene in Montreal."}
{"text":"In truth, I can't remember much of what we ordered, but that's largely due to the quantity and variety of dished that landed on our table as well as the unrelenting Sake Bomb assault.  Stand outs from the feast were definitely the Ramen and the Miso Beef Tongue. 

From what I can recall it was a lively atmosphere that our group definitely added to.  Service was great; I even think the owner/manager came by with some comp shots.

Bottom line is if you're looking for some pretty good food and a really good time, Imadake is the perfect spot to kick off the party."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for 8 for my bday and it was a lot of fun for all my guests including myself for supper.  I would definitely recommend this resto for a trendy modern Japanese bar vibe for almost any celebration, birthday, get togethers, dates--you can use this as an excuse to share food ;-)--but it's not that child friendly in terms of food options, better to get a baby sitter.  They don't shout out greetings as you enter but that's nice because the Kinka Izakaya does and at one point it's just too loud. The highlight for eating there has to be the sake bombs, and they have some serious triple decker setups for you to pound down and pound down (drink-wise).  The staff are totally on point service, complete with towels to wipe up any splashed drinks and flyaway chopsticks and returning everything to normal for you to enjoy your meal and drinks. My friend secretly asked them to get me a matcha green tea cheese cake because it was my bday and all of a sudden all the lights went out and then the staff start singing happy birthday much like the way they chant out the sake bomb.  The food portions are pretty good and all my guests who've never been there before all enjoyed their experience. If you're a large group be sure to reserve and for groups larger than 6 they require a credit card for reservations. Overall, its a great place to head out and enjoy, and hope your experience is a good one as well!"}
{"text":"Went there with high expectations, but I'm kinda disappointed :(

I tried the imadake chashu ramen and the beef tongue with rice on the lunch menu. The ramen broth was really dense and thick, I enjoyed the first few spoons, but then combined with the chashu porc, it started to taste really greasy...
As for the beef tongue, it was soooo salty, even the rice could not help reduce the oversaltyness. The tongue was a bit too hard and I had a really hard time chewing it.

I think imadake is definitively a good place for the snacks though. The fried octopus balls was mushy in the inside, but there was small chunks of octopus that made the texture more varied. I highly recommand the fried chicken, and you definitely have to try it with the wasabi sauce. Usually I can't handle wasabi well, but the sauce was creamy and tasted a bit sweet and spicy, not strong at all. 

I'll probably come back to try more of the snacks, but I won't eat any full meal there anymore."}
{"text":"Low-key izakaya with really great food and a nice drink selection.

The ramen broth was a little greasy for my taste, but there's a ton of other great stuff on the menu. The chicken gizzards were so tasty (and the most tender I've ever had!), and the squid was grilled perfectly. Wish I had the fried chicken cutlets - they looked fantastic!

Simple and really good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time going there yesterday. Very busy place and a little bit too crowded at the tables. Food was delicious though. I got deep fried goat cheese, shrimp tempura and chicken teriyaki. Would definitely go back but maybe during the week when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"I was craving for the ramen, so I went in straight to taste the ramen since I know the owner is the same as Yokato Yokabai and wanna give it a try.

I chose the pork based ramen. It was very similar to the one I had in Japan just less salty and greasy.

The ramen cost 13.5$ before taxes and tips which was fair. 

The service was also enough."}
{"text":"Cool Restaurant, the food is good.
Recommend: Cod, Takoyaki (fried octopus) and Japanese pancake (seafood) and have a Sake Bomb (beer and sake). 

Down: This place it loud, go there for the food and fun ambiance but if you want to have a discussion with your friends this is not the place."}
{"text":"I love draft Sapporo!!!!!!!!!!!! so this place is a must!!!! Get the chicken skin, imadake steak and beef tendon!"}
{"text":"I think I might be one of the rare people that do not like Imadake - I think there are so many more better choices for Izakayas nowadays in Montreal (Kinka, Kazu). 

They serve a large selection of Japanese Tapas but expect to pay a lot for an average quality. Their ramen are way too salty and thick (I couldn't finish them). The only thing that kept bringing me back to Imadake was their rainbow bombs but even then, they are not the cheapest drinks around."}
{"text":"Overpriced, underwhelming and the last few times I went either I or one of my friends got sick (like throwing up sick or bad digestive problems). I think they changed chefs because it was better when it opened. Maybe it used to be a good place when there were not so many izakayas available in Montreal but now it's just  a loud party place with pricy Japanese side dishes. Fun for young crowds seeking sake bombs and drinking mayhem."}
{"text":"Why did the chicken cross the road?

To get to the other side of the border where he ordered the eye-opening agedashi tofu, mouth-watering mushrooms, knee-weakening pork belly skewers, and button-popping yaki udon. All with a frosted Sapporo!

This place is impressive from top to bottom. You've got a dizzying array of food and drink menu selections and the atmosphere is electric. Everyone, including the staff, is in great spirits every time I visit this place. 

This is a great spot to hit up when visiting Montreal, especially when you want to take a break from French-Canadian cuisine."}
{"text":"Super service: amicale et rapide.
Ambiance électrisante.
Tous les plats sont servis chaud....très chaud. 
Pieuvre: excellent...principalement la sauce. Assiette bien dosée.
Maquereau: excellente cuisson. Sauce salée/ sucrée. Quelques arrêtes, malheureusement. 
Ramen épicé: très bon. Bonne portion. Les nouilles un peu grosses. Bouillon excellent et goûteux. Je le recommande.
Poutine week: très bonne. La portion en soit est tout en équilibre. Chaque élément complémente l'autre. 
Est-ce la meilleure? Non, malheureusement."}
{"text":"It's an okay place. The atmosphere is great and fun. If you're with a big group of people especially for a birthday it a good place to go for drinking ...they turn off the lights for your birthday and chant saki when they bring your saki. The food is okay nothing great but not horrible"}
{"text":"I was in town for a bachelor party and we wanted to find a bar to have some drinks before going out. This place was exactly what we were looking for. Great atmosphere, great staff, pretty hip crowd. We started with 10 Rainbow Bombs. So much fun and it seemed like everyone who was there got one at some point in the night. For food we got the edamame, takoyaki, and chicken skins which were perfect for snacking on while having beers. The \"head bus boy\" even brought us a round of sake bombs to celebrate the bachelor party. All in all, a pretty cool place that I will definitely be coming back to next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"The 5-star is based on the assumptions that 
1) you are down for a REAL Nihon-bar night experience, which means
2) you are tolerant of LOUD people, and cute(and/or hot) Asian girls in short uniform skirts running around who might miss orders sometimes

I'm down for both so I gave it a 5*

First of all, the food is, IMO, very close to what Japan has to offer. 
Make sure you order Karrage, and Okonomiyaki. They are Delish! 
- Okonomiyaki is this Japanese pancake made from eggs, shredded cabages, Dashi(Japanese cooking broth), meat (as far as I remember u get the option of octopus, squid or chicken), with the following topping - zigzagging Mayo, green onions and bonito  (some kind of fish) flakes flying on top. the presentation and the taste is definitely A+. 
- the Karrage I ordered was this deep-fried chicken pre-marinated in, probably soy sauce and garlic, with flour coating. I ate it with this garlic, soysauce dipping. hmm,hmm, tastay~ 
- I also ordered the pork-belly noodle soup. It's light but tasty to my taste buds, but some people might consider it bland.  

Second, make sure you go there for dinner on weekends; Once I went for lunch, only to find out they are only open for dinner on weekends. 

Something worth noticing of this place is: late at night, you might see a group of people doing shots, where they place little shots glass gently on top of two chopsticks that are stacked on top of some bigger beer mugs. The seismic wave created by either hitting the table, or probably just people yelling/cheering drop the shots glass into the beer mugs. This might explain why this place gets very loud sometimes.  

Decor is all simplistic, industrial style, high ceiling with a lot of wood elements (which I appreciate a lot), Utensils and dishwares seem to be authentic Japanese style. 

Last but NOT least, brace yourself for the chorus of greetings when you arrive and when you leave. Home-run for Imadake!"}
{"text":"Now first off i'd like to say that I've only eaten here once, and if/when the day comes that I go back and decide what I wrote is wrong then I will change it...
But, anyways.
The look and decor of the restaurant is nice and trendy, the employees there were nice. Menu was really small.
I tried the fried dumplings, they were average.. And I also had the ramen, only because that was the only option as a main dish, and I was not pleased at all, it was the second worst ramen i've ever had! :-/
Benefit of the doubt.. .. Maybe it's just not for me, I see alot of good reviews for this place. But then again, this is the point of reviews! :-)

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my previous review so I felt like an update was necessary. I guess I just picked the wrong dishes the first time I ate there because besides the okonomiyaki everything else was really good. I liked the takoyaki, karaage, gyoza, age chizu (deep fried goat cheese), korokke and ebi mayo. It's close to where I live so I'll probably end up trying all the dishes at some point! 

It does get pretty loud with the big groups and all the sake bombs, but I like to go early so it's still somewhat quiet."}
{"text":"Imadake, in my ever-fervent quest for good Japanese food in Montréal, doesn't quite hit the spot, but it's nevertheless a decent place in my opinion. I brought my parents here for an American Thanksgiving dinner (no turkey included, unfortunately), and its cozy, dim-lit vibe definitely hit all of the right notes on the ambience front.

After getting our drinks, we ordered eight plates to share among the three of us - the tonkatsu ramen, octopus salad, gindara (broiled cod), yakitori, tsukune patties, pork okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and agedashi tofu. Since the owners of Imadake also run Yokato Yokabai, I was excited to try the ramen; however, it came in an even smaller portion than the one at Yokato for seemingly the same price, and the taste wasn't as flavorful as Yokato's either. In addition, the octopus salad seemed rather small for what we were paying (around $5), and it seems to carry way too much wasabi in one bite (it actually numbs your mouth, and that's coming from someone with a high spice tolerance). Also, the gindara was quite small and less firm than I would have liked it to be, but it had a nice, smoky flavor and the charred skin was arguably the best part, as it was slightly sweet and provided a nice contrast to everything else we had.

Having said all of that, not all of the food was so-so by any means. The yakitori was very juicy and had that really nice grilled chicken taste that's essential for good skewers, and the chicken and pork flavors of the tsukune both came through in a smoky, herby delight. I was most excited to try the okonomiyaki since I've never had it before, and while it was good, I didn't think that there was much pork in there, if any. I did like the interesting texture with the vegetables and how it was different from the crispy outside, though, and I thought the bonito flakes were especially tasty and made it that much better. The takoyaki were perfect little balls of seafood-y goodness, with actual octopus chunks in the middle (some of my favorite things in the world) and a crisp outside that still makes me salivate when thinking about biting into its soft center. The mayonnaise is also a nice touch and reminds me of French fries dipped in mayo, but so much better. Finally, the agedashi tofu was one of the better ones that I've had, with its hot center going very well with the the cool, crisp radish and saltiness of the soy sauce.

Overall, I liked Imadake for what it's worth, although it's definitely a place for you to take your parents if you want a full meal as opposed to just drinks and some snacks. It can get very expensive very quickly as the total bill came to a little over $100, not including tip, so it's not the most ideal place for poor university students. It has a cool atmosphere and fun signature drinks like the sake bomb, but it can get loud pretty quickly as a result. I give extra bonus points to them for playing cool 80's music throughout the night, however, as I found it impossible to not sing along to my favorite tunes the whole night."}
{"text":"No doubt the best Izakaya in Montreal. Imadake means \"Now only\". Maybe it suggests livin in the moment.  This trendy lookin place is packed with energy. The service is great and they keep rollin out dishes really fast. One of the best Japanese food I've ever had.We ordered so many dishes and most of em hit the right spot. Not even goin to bother describing what we ordered. It was 8 of us and we almost tried half the items on their menu.  The food is soooo awesome it makes miso hot....That was a bad one....I am soy soy sorry. Have you laughed yourselves to the point of nori-turn????
Shoyu can't take it anymore? Are you bento-ver in pain?

Food -  Awesome 
Service - Friendly  & Fast
Ambiance - Casual / Crowded / Full of energy 
Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"I know Kazu is the place to go based on Yelp reviews, but needed a place that takes credit cards.  Leaving tomorrow morning and didn't want to deal with the cash thing, or the long waits.  This place did not disappoint.  Ramen was fantastic.  Char shu was tender and  flavorful.  Karaage was crisp and scrumptious.  Friendly service. Great last meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"I occasionally get dinner here before or after watching a movie at the cineplex cinema across the street. They have a nice selection of Japanese food: good ramen, tasty torched mackerel, decent black cod, ok okonomiyaki and takoyaki, a selection of uninspiring grilled items that are often burnt, and mochi and taiyaki. 

The servers are friendly, but seem overwhelmed and won't check on you during busy hours unless you wave at them. Most of the kitchen is open and visible to the customers-if you worry a lot about hygiene, this may not be the right place for you.

They have a karaoke room downstairs and maintain a generally loud atmosphere (loud music + occasional banging on the table for their signature drink). I won't go out of my way to get food here, but if you're into Japanese food and watching movies, you might find a way to appreciate this place as i do :)"}
{"text":"Good Japanese pub food. Had the okonamiyaki and grilled eggplant. Grilled eggplant was coated with a fur of bonito flakes. (I know what you are thinking, but it was great!) Service was a bit uneven, with varying degrees of friendliness and efficiency. But all in all a fun place."}
{"text":"This is a party place, with some pretty tasty Izakaya food.

Great service and fun servers. Roasted bass was a standout and we really enjoyed all of our other dishes! Reno the manager is awesome and made us feel welcome.

The whole \"sake bomb\" thing is a little corny but whatever, like I said this place is a party!

Overall it was a great experience, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not as good as we expected.  Portions are very small for the price even though this is an Izakaya.

Overall food quality was good, and waitress was super nice.  However, overall service was a disaster.  They forgot 3 dishes and then brought them with desert even after we asked to have them cancelled.

Didn't meet our high hopes/expectations.  There are so many better options."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere they do have the best fried chicken with wasabi mayo. I had their ramen noodles. Lacking in flavor and their pork belly could have been better. Best ramen so far is Ippodu in NYC."}
{"text":"My sister who used to live in Japan now lives in Montreal and told me this is her favorite izakaya style place in Montreal, which is why she brought us there.
I was a bit skeptical at first when we got in and I saw the waitresses wearing very very short skirts \"schoolgirl style\" but I had no reason to worry. The food is solid; I highly recommend the Gindara (miso marinated black codfish).
Of course, part of the fun is to do the sake bombs, which is when it gets very loud (WHEN I SAY \"SAKE\" YOU SAY \"BOMB\"! SAKE BOMB x 3). Personally I am not big on sake bomb or sake for that matter but they have a full bar so no complaint from me there!
Staff was nice and put up with our table with 2 little kids moving around without rolling their eyes, which is cool. They have big tables which makes it good for larger groups."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how awesome this place is! I absolutely love everything about this place. Such a shame I found this place after such a long time."}
{"text":"J'adore, j'adore, j'adore!!! Chaque item sur le menu est délectable, le service est toujours sympathique, l'ambiance de groupe est vraiment unique et que ferions-nous sans sake-bomb?! C'est l'endroit idéal pour commencer sa soirée en gang et bien partir le party. 

Leur menu, composé principalement de grillades et \"pub food\" japonais style tapas, se partage vraiment bien et sait combler la faim de ceux qui ont envie de goûter à tout. Pour moi, c'est les boules de chèvre frites avec sirop de framboises et érable, les takoyaki (boules de pieuvre frites) et les gyozas au porc qui me tentent à chaque fois! Ils font aussi d'excellents plats au miso : maquereau poché, morue noire grillée et--mon préféré--la langue de porc grilée. Malades! 

Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, préparez-vous à une soirée bruyante, mais festive. Avec des gens qui font le chant cérémonial du \"sake-bomb\"--shooter de sake dans un demi-verre de bière Sapporo--à toutes les 5 minutes, ce n'est pas une place propice pour une première \"date\". Et attendez-vous à en prendre au moins 2, à votre tour! Ça coule bien et c'est très légé au goût. Comme de l'eau! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"F-U-N! Sake! Bomb! Sake! Bomb! If you're allergic to fun, don't bother cause this spot is full of fun vibes and energy. The food is fantastic and best enjoyed when you order a bunch of small plates to share. It reminded me of my time in Japan! Highlights: Cow's tongue. Low points: not found in this post."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourite Japanese place. The ramen is amazing and all the subtle hints of flavour added to every meal makes them come alive. By the way, you must try the chicken karagge with wasabi mayo on the side. Great sake selection"}
{"text":"A pretty authentic Japanese izakaya, with a Montreal flavour! (with better service though).
The food is very tasty, fresh, and I have never waited long for it. Do not expect to walk in at night and get a table - you should definitely call for reservations as it is always busy. 
The food is reasonably priced, but like any resto, the booze is what adds up - and it adds up quickly here. You should absolutely try a Sake Bomb to warm up.
It gets loud, as it should, because it is young and exciting, so I wouldn't recommend it for old fuddy duds who like to complain. It is very English too! So if the language of Shakespeare burns your little ass, try somewhere in the east end and listen to French all night."}
{"text":"Fun, energetic vibe, make a reservation if possible or be prepared to wait.  Favorite dishes of the night were beef tartare, fried chicken, black cod and char siu ramen.  Ramen broth was very flavorful and good.  The grilled table steak and asparagus with bacon was pretty good too.  The shrimp tempura, chicken with plum sauce and grilled squid was ok.  Sappora beer comes in huge liter glasses or pint size on tap.  The sake bombs are fun to do.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Had the Grapefood Salad and pork belly miso soup ramen food is great will go there again"}
{"text":"My friends brought me here in Montreal.  

I would go here for drinks and food but if you're looking for a full meal I would look somewhere else. 

The food here is TASTY.  
- Grilled steak on a stone? Super cool and the beef just melts in your mouth 
- Raw octopus salad - was hesitant at first but the texture is super fun, you have to chew it thoroughly ! I would say octopus is an experience for sure.  This one came a bit spicy which is nice with the rawness.

The atmosphere is fun here for a night out.  Everyone is so cheerful and the staff are quick to get you anything you want.  They also cheer you on as you drink ! Gan bei !"}
{"text":"Food: I came here for lunch and the food here was good. I had their jellyfish salad and the beef tataki ramen with original broth. The broth was just right, full of flavor but not too salty or greasy. I also love rare beef, so this was the ramen for me! The soft boiled egg was also excellent and made correctly. The ramen also came with a regular salad. The jellyfish was nice. From looking at the menu, it would seem like this would be a great place for dinner or late night Japanese pub food. I will have to come here if I'm ever in Montreal again.

Service: Their wait staff are nice and friendly here. They are able to speak English. I got to the restaurant a bit early and they let me wait inside for the restaurant to open. The waitress even setup her own mobile hotspot for me to use as the restaurant's wi-fi was not working.

Location: The restaurant is very easy to get to via subway. It is just across the street from the Station Atwater. The restaurant is pretty spacious and you can see what's going on the kitchen. The washrooms are located downstairs."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot maybe a handful of times and realized during my last visit, that the food is amazing but the scene is really not my thing. A friend and I spent NYE dining on the chef's special and so we got to try an array of their popular dishes and each one was moist, flavourful and portions are just right; it's a tapas style restaurant so 3 to 4 dishes per person to share is more than enough. The black cod and octopus balls are by far a favourite. The drinks are good but I would opt for a sake if that's your thing too. The downside of this place is that it's loud, like really loud, and holding a conversation around people yelling before their \"sake bomb\", or lights out for a birthday cake, can be distracting. Most izakayas are loud either way but I return here since the food makes the experience tolerable. The service was good and friendly, and we left the restaurant content but no voices"}
{"text":"I decided to check this out with a friend since I wanted some takoyaki. I knew about the takoyaki and I have already tasted it at the Matsuri festival. The atmosphere was something, it had a good vibe! The greetings made the visit worth it. Either way, will visit again!"}
{"text":"The ramen is okay, the octopus appetizer is good. You should just come here for Stephanie. She makes this place so much more fun!!"}
{"text":"BY FAR the best ramen in the city, don't be fooled by imitators"}
{"text":"To say I'm not impressed is only the beginning.
To start off with, the place is way too loud. I couldn't hear the person next to me or across from me without them raising their voice.
The seats are very uncomfortable and unpleasant. There is also not enough space between tables, making it far too tight and crowded.
The service was terrible. Slow is the word that comes to mind. The server wasn't outgoingly friendly, nor was she well educated on the menu.
The menu is bleak and the portions are far too small.
The food is ok. The bacon asparagus was very good. The wasabi squid was really good. The chicken teriyaki was mediocre at best and the veggie dumplings were flat out terrible and flavourless.
My girlfriend had the steamed vegetables with noodles and it was beyond bland.
I left hungry and unsatisfied. My ears are still ringing from the noise, but at least my butt has feeling back after sitting on those horrible \"chairs\".
I don't understand the hype of this place, and will never ever go back or recommend it to anybody. Your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Imadake is easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. There is no flashy sign to mark this restaurant, but they don't need it! 
Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. I ordered the Ramen with chicken... WOW WOW WOW! The chicken tasted a little like bourbon chicken, the broth was creamy (almost like egg drop soup) and the rest of the bowl was delicious. I highly recommend adding the sesame seed spice/sauce to your bowl for a little kick! 
The food came out with good time, but our waiter told us there was a mistake in the kitchen. We ended up with free dessert because of that! You must go here while in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"This place is an incredible izakaya. The atmosphere is great, the staff are super nice and the service is excellent. The food is really good, the tempura shrimp with spicy mayo is amazing. The black cod literally melts in your mouth. And the surprise dome salad is amazing too. One of my top 5 restos hands down."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had! The broth was perfect and the topping and noodles were great. Atmosphere is fun, and service was great! I can't wait to return. I'd suggest reservations if you are going on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Was here for my last birthday. This place is so much fun. I would definitely recommend the rainbow bomb for anyone looking to out do the regular sake bomb. The food compliments the drinks really well and the smaller cheap portions leave room to try everything. Great place to go to with friends. Only downside is the reservation process and the hostess was very lost and rude even when i made reservations 3 weeks in advance i had to argue to get a table. Our waiter was great though and really gave us some great suggestions for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Octopus balls!!!!
From the street this restaurant doesn't catch the eye. Once you get in, it's more interesting. You get welcome by all the staff cheerfully screaming a nice Japanese word that I did not understand. I'm guessing it meant hello or welcome. The decor is pretty nice with some cultural touches everywhere, tableware, beautiful mural, decorative sake bottle and very short schoolgirl skirts. The bad part was that I had to sit on a wooden crate thing. You need to order the 'Sake Bomb' a fun drink made from rice beer and, of course, sake. 

Now, the food. There's all kind of little plates you can order and also bigger plates like the best Ramen i have ever eaten, spicy and tasteful. I can't get enough of their octopus balls which melt in your mouth. Special mention to the Koroke, incredibly original fried potato croquette and my son's favorite. I particularly love the dried fish flakes you can find on most of the dishes. There lots of things worth trying or reordering. 

For me, it was a special diner because it was my first time out of the children's hospital in a long time. It's a great place to change your mind if you're stuck there since it's just beside. well, for me it was."}
{"text":"Ok still very yummy and fun for sure. No question. I ducked in here for a super quick lunch today and it was great, I didn't have to wait, the spicy ramen was quick and hearty and I was in and out in 30 minutes in time for my next meeting. But something about the harsh light of day revealed some dust and strain I hadn't noticed while doing sake bombs before, and in the bathroom downstairs the toilet wouldn't flush and the tap on the sink was pulled out of its base and busted and there was some general grime. Not a huge deal but I think a bathroom reflects on the overall state of things in the kitchen and this one left me mildly worried."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place from all the yelp reviews and seeing a huge line up on the weekends. So coming here I had really high expectations. I thought the drinks would be priced great so we can order many. But I think on a student budget, it's too pricey. So we settled for food, which the menu offered mostly tapas like skewers, and cold dishes. They're all reasonable prices but the amount you need to order to make you're self full can be pricey, so our group actually ended up getting the tonkotsu ramen. I got it with beef, which was so good but I wish they offered larger portions. I think this is a great place for people that have a better budget then students. Anyways cool experience."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going to Imadake and you're from Toronto, think again. Imadake is not even on the same level as the izakayas in Toronto are much better! (I'm thinking about Kingyo and even Guu). The portions at Imadake are much smaller compared to Toronto. The food generally lacks flavour. The atmosphere left something to be desired - it's loud which I expect from all izakayas but all I heard throughout my meal was SAKE BOMB SAKE BOMB SAKE BOMB.

We sat at the bar and our service was attentive. The employees seem decent but they all looked like they were just university students or graduates.


We ordered the following:

1) Karaage ($9) - Small pieces of chicken which were not moist/juicy inside. It lacked flavour on it's own. I wasn't a fan of the wasabi mayo but you really have to put that on to get some kind of flavour. 

2) Ebimayo ($8) - Shrimp were very small. This one was sort of interesting because it had some nuts and  greens to top off the shrimp which is different than what I am use to. I thought this was pricey for the serving we received. :s

3) Yuzu Chicken ($6) - Again, very small pieces of chicken which lacked flavour and tasted like it was deep fried to hell. The fried batter was very dark and almost too crunchy. It tasted like terrible popcorn chicken. 

4) Takoyaki ($7) - Small balls of octopus. This one was alright although I'm not sure if this was made fresh because it resembles store bought takoyaki with flat bottoms rather than round spheres. 

5) Spicy ramen ($12) - The only good dish that I really enjoyed for the meal. This wasn't a huge bowl but I wasn't expecting it to be. The broth was very flavourful."}
{"text":"I had so much fun at this place! I loved the decor and the open concept kitchen, and the atmosphere was very energetic and lots of fun! Sake bombs everywhere! Every time a table orders sake bombs, the waitress leads a drinking chant at the end of which everyone downs the drinks.
It's authentic (more or less..) and is meant for sharing, tapas-style. Probably my favourite Japanese restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had the smoked eel and takoyaki appetizers with the char siu ramen.  The takoyaki was great and the octopus wasn't at all tough, which is the case at a lot of places.  The ramen was nicely seasoned and perfectly complemented by the pork belly.  The eel was good, but not amazing.  But I'm also extra picky when it comes to eel.  This is a fun, lively place on the weekends and the atmosphere is great.  Food is better at Kazu but the ambiance is more fun here."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst representation of a good restaurant in Montreal. Service was terrible, I tipped incredibly high, but not impressed whatsoever. Will NEVER return!! Was hoping to have a great place to return to, sorry to say that was not the case."}
{"text":"Au premier coup d'oeil, le restaurant est défraîchi et manque d'animosité. 

On a quand même pris place sur les minis poufs en bois qui servent de chaise et nous avons attentivement regardé le menu. Le menu est intéressant. Il y a plusieurs choix, classés par catégorie genre froid, chaud, grillé, frit, etc. La serveuse nous avait conseillé d'en prendre 4-5 pour deux. Elle avait bien raison! Nous avons pris 5 assiettes avec des edamames (ça compte pas). Nous avons beaucoup aimé la nourriture!

Nous avons goûté à un plat de sashimi flambé (un délice, mais vraiment petit), une assiette de calmar entier grillé (voir photo), des boules de pieuvres frites (OK, mais on ne dirait vraiment pas de la pieuvre), des dumplings au porc et finalement, une assiette de buf que tu fais toi-même cuire sur une plaque chauffante! C'était vraiment très bon et nous en avons eu pour notre argent. Les produits sont frais et bien assaisonnés! 

En gros, le restaurant aurait besoin d'un sérieux relooking. Sinon, la bouffe est bonne, mais j'ai déjà essayé de meilleurs Isakaya et restaurants japonais à Montréal. Toutefois, pour le prix, nous avons très bien mangé!

Merci :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Imadake several times and have introduced it to many friends.  It's unanimous: This eatery is all about good food.  My favs are the white fish carpaccio with ponzu, the black cod, tofu salad and of course the yummy Ramen noodles in thick soup broth.  Prices are very reasonable and you can't beat the atmosphere of a Japanese pub and the shout outs of sake bombs.  Beware: noise levels on weekends late nights not for the mild-mannered diner."}
{"text":"\"Huh?!\"  \"What!??\" \"I don't know, I can't hear you!\" about sums up my experience at Imadake. Plus, I would give this a 3.5, not a 3 if I could. 

After a day of drinking, by this time a headache has settled in and coming to Imadake made it that much worse, but in a fun way of course. This was probably the loudest place I have ever been to in my life, which includes concerts, dance clubs and standing inside of a jet engine.

The food was pretty excellent though! I don't know the names but we got a beef thing that you cook on an extremely hot rock, the rock stays hot for like 15 minutes wowzaaaa! Delicious. The chicken and pork kafta (I think?) was also pretty awesome. 

The sake bombs were interesting but plentiful. If you go here, you will either scream \"bomb\" or hear others screaming it just before they shoot it."}
{"text":"I have been craving some Japanese Izakaya for quite some time and have been watching Imadake and the reviews closely looking forward to the day in which I could try it out!  Japanese Izakaya is getting quite popular in Toronto and Vancouver and other cities because it's a very easy concept.  Small appetizer plates but very tasty with a Japanese theme.  In Japan this is Happy Hour food and beer for you mid-western folks out there!  A seriously awesome concept!  

Okay enough with my intro.......onto the food!  

Since my wife is an Izakaya newbie I didn't order many of the crazy dishes I'd normally such as ox tongue, chicken skin or other fishy North American \"not so used\" to dishes.  

The evening throw down was this:  

Gomae-  smaller portion but nice sauce and quite good.  3 / 5
Seaweed Salad-   great dressing fresh and light  3.5 / 5
Shimesaba-   smaller portion cuts of fish but nicely done.  3.5 / 5
Chicken yakitori skewers in a sour plum sauce-  yummy tender thigh pieces.  4 / 5
Takoyaki- On Osaka classic lightly doughy and good. Not as much tako meat more dough but good.  3 / 5
Vegetable Yakisoba- done with a nice bulldog tonkatsu sauce taste and flavourful  4 / 5
Vegetable Tempura- I've had better elsewhere. Crisp but batter could have been better 2.5 / 5

To wash it down I chose a large $10 Sapporo.  My wife had a mojito (she claimed devishly fantastic).  

I'll have to try some of the other Izakaya in the YUL but I'm down with this joint.  

Be careful kids.  Lots of homeless people in the sketchy neighbourhood.  A rather unfortunate minor concern but be aware!"}
{"text":"What's a memory worth? Assigning a dollar value might be a silly proposition, sure, but it's an earnest one too.  Whatever your magic number is, I'd wager that it's orders of magnitude greater than the $25 I spent here a few nights ago.  Aside from the cool décor, the first thing I noticed about Imadake was the massive fun everyone was having.  The second we stepped in, it felt like tectonic plates shifted under us.  Turns out, it was just patrons chanting and pounding the tables during rounds of the Sake Bombs - something like Imadake's spin on the Irish Carbomb.  

By the end of the night, I was absolutely drenched in alcohol: half it from multiple rounds of Sake bombs sloshing onto my shirt, the other half from a ruptured beerstein that spilled an ice-cold Sapporo all over my pants.  And you know what? I didn't mind at all.  The staff and owner rocked.  The latter was kind enough to slash a sizable chunk off my tab, but gave me a few free drinks for the mishap.  I dare you to have a bad time here.  All told, I left this place soaked in beer and good vibrations in equal measure. Easily one of the best drinking experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is a blast......yes the demographic is the under 30's set with us ending up that night as their cool parents out on the town.

Imadake reminds me of all those vaguely Asian West Village dives I used to frequent in my inebriated youth back the 80's. Overheated,loud,dark and a bit seedy just to add an edge to this Saint Cath's Izakaya/Ramen/restaurant/bar.

Seated by a SWAT officer and attended to by a petit Hello Kitty {it was 2 days to Halloween} we took in the décor which is decidedly spare but efficient, with French rap as our background music we started with their seaweed salad which was excellent with that salty/sweet crunch over the freshest baby greens with a mild ginger flavored dressing.....a great start made even better with a glass of ice cold Sapporo lager.

Their famous crispy deep fried Chicken skin is indescribable in its salty, crispy goodness and one of the main reasons we had to try this Restaurant. It was indeed worth it.

Next came the BBQ pork belly with a soy/ merin glaze with dusting of a delicious cumin tinged seasoning, I could have had 2 more but the tender and tasty whole squid was next served with a creamy garlic dip.....Time for another Sapporo.

We rested a bit deciding what to order next while watching in awe all the tables around us consume round after round of Sake Bombs.... \"When I say Sake you say Bomb! Sake Bomb! Sake Bomb! Sake Bomb!\" shouts our Hello Kitty and with a final bang on the table the shot glass of Sake plopped into the beer with a satisfying splash....most of the time....I'm hungry again.

We decided on the grilled beef tongue which was a bit tough but tasty never the less, sliced thin,coated in a slightly sweet glaze and expertly grilled, the tongue was chewy but filled with all the beefy goodness charcoal heat brings out with just the right amount of char around the edges. Next to the Chicken skin my favorite of the night.

Our final dish was in essence a prime example of Japanese Inspired packaging as it was basically all the end cuttings of the night with raw salmon,fried tofu bits,seaweed,Nori covered with a fried wonton skin....so a leftovers salad. good not great.

Imadake is a loud,boistrious and above all a tasty fun venue for some very unique but delicious Japanese small dishes and we can't wait to try more of their menu.

Have a Sake Bomb.....\"When I say Sake, you say Bomb....Sake?     Go ahead I dare you."}
{"text":"Oska style Japanese pub (characteristic emphasis on fried food/noodles to accompany prodigious drinking) was quiet as a tomb for weekday lunch. Am assuming that's not the case at night. Large chalkboard drawings extolling the virtues of ordering Sake Bombs and other signs pointed to a quick turnover/rowdy customers late night vibe - same as it would be in Osaka. Bullet dodged. Takoyaki were more on the fried than the baked side, but good, nice whitefish carpachio, beer ice cold. No surprises and no complaints."}
{"text":"I've tried my fair share of japanese restaurants in Montreal and this is the closest I've gotten to authentic japanese food. I don't understand how some people could have been disappointed by the okonomiyaki because this was the best one I've had since I came back from Japan. I also highly recommend their gyoza and yakisoba. It's a little bit loud as other reviewers have mentioned but it should be expected in that kind of restaurant, and the service definitely made up for it. I was impressed to see that the menu was vegetarian friendly (I had a hard time finding veggie okonomiyaki until then), and they have a good selection of drinks as well. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for a weekend and thanks to all the great Yelp reviews, decided to come here for dinner. Even on a Sunday evening in 10 degree weather, this place was busy. Luckily we were still able to get a table without waiting because, well, it's Sunday night and it's 10 degrees outside.

We had the tuna special, agedashi tofu, grilled beef tongue, and grilled bacon-wrapped asparagus for appetizers. Then we split the char siu ramen, and ended with the green tea cheesecake. Loved the taste of everything, especially the tuna special. The ramen broth is as good as any I've ever had. 

Things I wished were better: 1) The agedashi tofu arrived at the table with most of the crispy skin already soggy. 2) Bacon-wrapped asparagus was slightly overcooked. 3) Better staggering of dishes, especially since the table for 2 was rather small.

The vibe and decor were great. The chairs were brilliant and came with a compartment for you to put your bag in. If you like sake bombs, you'd appreciate their sake bomb services. Service was prompt, attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. 

Will definitely come here again when we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant where you would want to chill with your friends and enjoy the drinks! It's very loud mainly because of the sake bomb rituals...but hey, they're quite amazing so alcohol-lovers out there; you must try out their sake bombs! This is definitely an amazing place to drink out with your friends! Food ain't bad too for its price!"}
{"text":"Bonne place pour prendre un verre avec des amis tout en dégustant une variété de tapas japonais. Service pressé et parfois un peu froid, sauf lorsque vient le temps de prendre un SAKÉ BOMB (à essayer)! Noter que le prix dépasse facilement la cote $$ (30$) si vous avez une bonne faim."}
{"text":"We went here because of the good reviews and because they were one of the places still open past 11:00 PM.  Upon arriving, we noticed the place was completely packed, which was a good sign.  We went in, and was finally able to get a seat after about 20 minutes.  We didn't have a reservation, but the place still wasn't very organized in getting us a seat.  At one point they even told us that they had some seats ready, brought us back there to find out that it wasn't ready.

So when we finally sat down, we ordered some ramen and some yakisoba.  The ramen arrived quickly, but the yakisoba took forever to arrive.  My wife was almost done eating her ramen by the time the yakisoba arrived.  In addition, both items, especially the ramen, were very salty.  They had put way too much salt in the ramen, and aside from that, it didn't have much taste.  In a previous review, it said the ramen was by far the best in Montreal.  If this is the best ramen in Montreal, then I definitely don't want to try any other ramen in Montreal ever again.  I've had MUCH better ramen in any other city with a decent-sized Asian population.  The yakisoba was a little better, but still had too much sodium.

The service overall was a bit slow.  It was understandable since the place was packed with people getting drunk off their sake bombs, but the waitress still took a long time to notice we were waiting for the check long after we were done, even after walking past us a few times.

I understand how this place could be a great atmosphere to hang out if you're with the crowd that wants to down sake bombs until piss drunk (which is the only part that allowed me to give the place 2 stars), but if you just want to grab a meal, I'd definitely look elsewhere."}
{"text":"came with a group of about 6. sake bombs and a ton of food. portions are on the smaller side. everything we had was alright. nothing stood out as being great. the dome surprise was pretty a pretty lame surprise. salad underneath some type of thin filo dough. good drinking spot."}
{"text":"What a blast!  We were looking for sushi, and so we picked this place for all of the great reviews... which is ironic since, as it turns out, they don't have sushi.  But the creative Japanese style dishes that they do have were fantastic.  Between the three of us, we ordered at least a dozen small plate dishes, and all of them were great.  However, I have to put a special recommendation in for the sea bass which wasn't just great... it was divine.  Friendly service and interesting atmosphere were just icing on the proverbial cake.  Try it."}
{"text":"Sake bomb! :)

This place is perfect for a group of people, who don't mind noise and want to have fun."}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE!
So many different options to chose from. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. SOOOOOOO great! I can't wait to go back! Totally worth the cost of the plates. It's how much alcohol you drink WITH your plates that will jack up your bill. But still, worth it."}
{"text":"Was here on a Saturday night with friends. The crowd is made up of mostly 18-25. The decor is minimal, almost industrial...plain square tables with square \"crate\" stools. The kitchen is open concept and in plain view of everyone. The staff is made up of young, hip students, and despite the loud music they were able to hear/see us when we needed something. Our waiter was helpful and made good suggestions. We ordered Vegetable tempura, tofu salad, Chicken Karaage and Chicken Yaki Tori and the fried cheese with a plum sauce. All were excellent. We ordered a round of drinks that included 1/2 Beer with ginger ale, and a Malibu Pineapple...all were great! Would definitely go back, but have to be in the right state of mind, because again, it is rather on the loud side."}
{"text":"We came to Imadake on a Friday night before a movie after seeing the positive reviews. The place was bustling and there was lots of laughter and music. It was a great ambience for a Friday night so we were having a good time. There were 2 of us and we ordered 7 dishes between us. We LOVE japaneese food, and east asian food in general so we were really looking forward to it.

I think our favorite dish was the beef we cooked on the hot plate/ marble slab. It was tasty but also interactive which was cool. Otherwise, we ordered dumplings, squid, sausage, and a few other meat dishes but they were super mediocre. The squid was dry and rubbery, and the skewers were pretty flavourless and greasy. We really aren't very picky eaters, we generally love food but because we had high expectations we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing is fresh. Refrigerated food served for a dumb price and their only selling point would be the fact they are among the izakayas in Montreal.  Poor quality. I had the following:
-takowasa: uneatable. Not fresh. Doused in wasabi. Soggy. 0/5
-vegetable gyoza: terrible fridge taste. 0/5
-tuna tataki: 2/5 pre-made again. Not fresh.
-kinoko ramen: 2/5 arrived lukewarm. Mushrooms still cold. Eminem would say the noodles are like moms spaghetti. Lack of flavor. Expensive for what it is.

The Malibu mango drink wasn't balanced at all. Just tasted like mango juice.

AVOID"}
{"text":"Yes it's very noisy and I almost left because of that but once the food came, it make you forget  about everything that could bug you even if you are the type of person who like to enjoy a meal in a very calm atmosphere. 
The miso marinated black cod was perfectly seasoned and cook. It was moist, flaky and melted into my mouth. Beef tataki was tender and perfectly sliced. The fried goat cheese had some kind of fruity sweet sauce on top (prolly a raspberry/red fruit coulis) and it was balancing the saltyness of the goat cheese (you should order that along with a salad and mix em' together like we did. 
The sea weed and sesame dressing salad was good but a bit underseasoned (mixed with the goat cheese tho it was perfect). 
We also had some kind of fried octopus balls topped with smoked sturgeon flakes. They we're juicy, well fried, overall.. Lot of flavors! Chicken with plum sauce was surprising because we thought that would be sweet and sour but it was more sour and acidic. It was kinda good but not my favorite (execution of the meal was perfect still).
Service was fast and friendly even if we waited a bit for our beer ( they had problem with the draft so I can't penalize them for that). They also offered us a sake bomb at end (witch was not necessary) so it show that they really care about their customer. 
Will I come back? Yes! I'm going back next week to try more!"}
{"text":"I have never been deceived by them, the menu is great, they have amazing choices. I love their octopus balls and their ramen. They also have the day special which is always great (for me, never had something I didn't like). If you still have some place for dessert (which I always do) they have some nice traditional choices, as the Michu ice cream or Taiyaki (red bean paste in warm soft fish shaped cake). Everything is good, just go there if you are craving some good Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Bikkuri shita! This place is fun!

You won't find traditional Japanese decor and ancestral paintings here, just good food, good booze and good fun!

Sake bombs, litres of Sapporo and food in small portions so you can try everything. Everyone has their favourites, the grilled black codfish, stone beef and takoyaki come to mind, but you'll find your own and you'll want to share them with friends.

Imadake is one of those places where it always feels like a party, whether there's 2 or 20 of you. If there's only one of you, call me, I'll go with you and walk you through my favourites."}
{"text":"Just returned from there on a Wednesday an hour before closing. Was alone so sat at the counter at the very back next to the register.  Greeted by Kuby, the most lovely Japanese girl with pink highlights behind the counter filling up three pitchers of Sapporo.  She would the highlight of my brief stay there.  Friendly and welcoming she was (yes, Yoda speak)

The place was lively and frenetic.  Several large parties doing shots and chanting wierd hipster mantras.  The wait and kitchen staff (all visible out front) was friendly and attentive - particularly Kuby-chun.

Will return someday from San Francisco.  Hopeful it won't become a Shawarma shop in the meantime.  Go for the authentic izakaya experience, run by real Japanese staff.  Or next time it may be a vegie Gyro you'll be ordering there."}
{"text":"I went here once last year with a group of 15 people (friends @ work) and we really go a great service and good food. 

I came back this year for my bday, mid-september. We were four and loved it too.

First time I came here there was a lot of noise. (Thursday) There is this environment where the waiters yell to each other (in some asian I guess It's japanese). Of course you have to add-on the Shots : the famous Sake-Bomb so if there are quite a lot in a row that are ordered, it gets pretty pretty noisy and it's hard to have a conversation. 
If you do not go as a group, you might be sitting next to strangers, like in Asia ! 
This year we went on a Monday : it was much better for the noise level ! 

The food is really tasty and yummy. We love their sizzling beef, the really tasty pork belly skewers, the fried chicken, etc. With a good bottle of SAKE !! 

We always had good service even when we were the group of 15.

This is good restaurant for groups and for sharing food !!"}
{"text":"Imadake has a really fun and lively atmosphere, and super delicious food! 

We made reservations for 11:00 PM on a Saturday evening, and we were seated right away even though the place was packed. Imadake is the perfect place to grab a drink with a couple of friends. The staff were really friendly and service was surprisingly fast even though the place was crowded. Their 'sake bombs' seem to be quite popular too! 

Food we ordered:

- Imadake Original Ramen ~$11.00 ( I highly recommend, the broth was so delicious!)
- Takowasa/ Wasabi Octopus ~$4.00 (Interesting dish, it was spicy at first but the spicy taste disappears quite fast)
- Aburi Shime Saba/ Blow torched Mackerel ~$6.50 (I love mackerel and this dish was cool because they blow torched the mackerel right in front of you!)
- Soft Shell Crab ~$10.00 (Delicious) 
- Yuzu Tuna Tataki/Seared Tuna Sashimi ~$11.00 (Super delicious!) 
- Matcha Cheesecake ~$6.00 (The cheesecake was a little heavy for me) 
- Drink: Malibu Mango ~$9.00 (This drink was so delicious, I highly recommend) 

Overall: Imadake is a perfect place for drinks - especially if you're going with a large group of friends. I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time because the place is quite packed, even at 11:00 PM at night. All the servers were really friendly and service was quite fast! I'd recommend the imadake original ramen - super delicious/rich ramen broth, and the malibu mango drink!"}
{"text":"Love this spot, went for my birthday and had the best time. It's a really young crowd and may get loud so maybe just be careful who you bring. You'll be pleasantly surprised with the wide array of vegetarian options and just food items in general. Good drinks, good vibes!"}
{"text":"Nice place to have a party. The sake bomb is awesome. But the waitresses doesn't seem to care much when some of the drink is spilled. Just walks away."}
{"text":"Agreed. This place is right on. Dinner was seven tapas dishes, each one was spot on. We'd been looking for great Japanese food that wasn't sushi and Imadake scratched the itch. Service was professionally competent to a level rarely seen in Montreal (in other words appeared at all the right times with all the right attitudes) and the entire atmosphere is a fun ride whether or not you're partaking of the crazier, sake-bomb fuelled side.

They take reservations and if you're going on a weekend night, I'd recommend them."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews, I figured I had to try Imadake! I went on a Wednesday night with my husband. The restaurant was pretty full. Noisy, dynamic yet trendy and welcoming sums up the ambiance. Being vegetarian, we ordered the veggie Yakiudon and the veggie Japanese Pancake. The noodles of the Yakiudon were fresh and tasty, and the Japanese Pancake was surprisingly delicious as well. Take note that the portions are small, so consider ordering a side dish if you have a bigger appetite. 

This place, being noisy and dynamic, is ideal for groups. If you're looking for a romantic tête-à-tête evening, you might want to reconsider your choice, however if you thrive in active environments, it might be just your perfect match! Their staff is super friendly and helpful, adding to the overall experience.

Lastly, a tip for vegetarians: If you order the Japanese Pancake, make sure to order it without the fish flakes that would normally come on top. Additionally, their ramen soups have a fish/chicken base so you may want to consider their noodles instead."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ramen noodles are great and the fried goat cheese with raspberry maple syrup are a must. 

The staff are supper nice and service is quick and efficient but doesn't seem rushed. 

The decor is nice, not really my cup of tea but that's just a matter of taste. The ambiance is fun I've visited three time now and only once was it a little blah but it was late and a Monday evening so I guess I asked for it.

The prices are are good, you could get away under $30 per person easily without any booz, add a beer or two and you might still get out for around $30. 

All and all a good restaurant worth visiting."}
{"text":"We went as a group of twenty for our birthdays (5 girls have birthday in February) 

Our waitress was Ashley, and she was fantastic! She was sweet, attentive, funny and very on the ball. The rest of the staff have an equally awesome attitude and work ethic. You're surrounded by staff who love their job ;)

The food is always delicious. Tapas style; good for sharing with someone. They offer ramen noodle bowls, dumplings, fried chicken, bacon wrappped asparagus, beef tataki, white fish ceviche, octopus balls among so much more!  I've never had a bad dish here. 


They have specialty cocktails, beer and a vast selection of sake. 

If you're going it's always recommend to make a reservation; they require a credit card to guarantee your spot. It's always busy. 

Noise level is pretty loud but it goes with the ambiance. 

They are (I guess) known for their sake bombs and sake bombs chant. *When I say sake you say bomb..Sake.. BOOOMB! 

Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, especially for a large group of people! They also have a separate room downstairs for an even larger party. The iconic sake bombs are a must but honestly, the food isn't the greatest and the price is a bit too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Small but packs a punch! Fresh and light ingredients. Wonderful flavours. Must try the sake bombs (they make an event out of it) I had the miso black cod with oysters shrooms and edamame. Also had the vegetarian dumplings. Everything was superb. Great little spot!"}
{"text":"The Sake Bombs are fun even though they fly all over the place. I took the grilled mushrooms and the beef tongue. The mushroom was very good, but the beef tongue was dry and chewy... 
Love the ambience. Rowdy, fun and cozy!"}
{"text":"Yes ! Great spot for a large group, perfect if you feel like having funky shots while screaming SAKE BOMB with the entire restaurant, PLUS they have very nice food. I've been there with a large partying group, but also just with a friend and everytime we enjoy good food and a fun time. Gotta try it ! Try the ebimayo (fried shrimps with peanuts and a spicy mayo!)"}
{"text":"This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal! 
(Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)

So many great nights spent here! This place is basically the Guu Izakaya of Montreal with a twist! Don't get your expectations up as the food is quite average. I would highly recommended the black cod. Trust me, this dish is a solid 5. 

This is a place where you pay for the atmosphere rather than food. Imadake never disappoints! I love how they have a blackboard to scribble on especially when you are drunk. Great place to take pics and laugh about the next day. 

Trust me you know it will be an unforgettable night when the \"sake bombs\" and \"rainbow bombs\" arrive. Highly recommended to go for the experience!"}
{"text":"I wanna give the service a 2, though the food was pretty solid, I'd give a 4.5
I came to Montreal from Vancouver to visit a friend with another friend who was coming from Toronto. We stood at the door for a good 10 or more minutes without even being greeted or acknowledged. Finally someone came and seated us. 
We then sat for another 10 minutes with no menu, and when we waved someone down for a menu, he looked at us blankly and then said \"I'll give you the menus?\" . Which we thought was weird and funny at the same time. 
We ordered a bunch of tapas and they were all really delicious, and finally we tried the sake bombs that made the night great and made me forget about the service. 

I'd come back for the food and the sake bombs."}

Number one: There was no food poisoning and no mistake in my orders! So i hope this kind of kill the other that gave ridiculous small marks.  IMO if you say on a public thread you got food poisoning from a restaurant maybe there is something else to it: Like taking too much alcohol, having the flu, being sick from something else, anyway!

Yesterday was one of my new struggle when i decide on Japanese food but new place versus one tried more than once ...Imadake won. First, the Decor kind of remind me of M:BGR second of all, I kind of stuck comparing meal with Kazu which is their competition who has been on open for a long time and has a way smaller place than imadake. So without going into deep description, i will say that this place scores the same as Kazu and the only true difference would be physical ( larger place).  I think this place doesn't have much mistakes. Most staff are polyglote (speaks more than 2 languages which is a big plus compare to Kazu where some staff might not be fluent in french).  But at the end of the day, if you were to ask me where will you go next time Kazu or Imadake: I might say Imadake because I will not wait! Kazu is overpacted and you now need to get there at least 20 minutes before opening and right now it's cold outside.

Ok Ok, I think i will have to make this review a comparaison between Kazu and Imadake after all!
Well food wise, it's really similar presentation execution and taste. The upper side might go to Imadake in term of booze! They have sake that i have never saw at Kazu
IMO the Okonomiyaki is a bit better at Kazu because they had a nice salad to the meal but Pancake VS Pancake it's equal! Imadake serve it more classical.
They are missing one item on their menu: Onigiri rice balls. Kazu win that one!
On the other side, i would argue that they have a slightly larger menu and the booze got all to do with it! 

If you want to try it, i would suggest you to buy everything you can humanly eat and share it with a friend. It pretty much reduce the price of the bill and you end up trying so many things! it's really fun.

En premier lieu, je crois que si nous sommes pour argumenté sur une erreur idiote comme: il me manquait un truc, c'est à soi-même de faire le décompte. Honnêtement, je suis surpris de voir que nos serveurs se rappelle de tout la majorité du temps. Il faut laisser le temps au staff de s'accoutumer au menu et prendre de l'expérience. On ressent effectivement des vibes de débutant mais sans problème. Je veux dire, je ne parle pas japonais, eux non-plus, ils sont souvent vietnamien, laosien, cambodgien etc.  Ahh et je n'ai pas eu d'empoisonnement alimentaire . 

Hier c'était un vrai débat: On essaye imadake ou on retourne chez Kazu. Étant un foodie hardcore, j'ai pas prit énormemment de temps a choisir le nouveau venu. Imadake me fait penser à M:BRG comme décor, dans le genre branché, clean, pas trop sérieux avec des murs en tableau noir d'école. Je m'étais dit que j'n'allais pas faire de cette critique une comparaison entre Kazu et Imadake, mais j'abandonne. C'est vraiment semblable, c'est simplement plus gros chez Imadake ce qui se résulte en moins d'attente avant de pouvoir manger.

La différence des deux dans le menu c'est quelques trucs. Imadake ont quelque trucs que Kazu n'ont pas. En revanche, Kazu ont des (boule de riz collante assaisonnée) Onigiri et pas Imadake et Imadake ont beaucoup de choix d'alcool et peu chez KAzu. C'est comme comparé des jumeaux non-identique. Ils sont pas mal semblable mais pas pareil. Je donnais la partie pour la crêpe japonaise (Okonomiyaki) à Kazu à cause de l'ajout d'une salade et d'une vinaigrette légèrement acide plus relevé. La Crêpe chez Imadake vient plus neutre, seule, sans accompagnement sans l'assiette: présentation plus traditionnelle. 

J'ai une prédiction pour les Nihon Bar (Pub Japonais) à Montréal et c'est que ça va explosé en nombre dans 10 ans!  C'est une cuisine hyper accessible au occidentaux et c'est de la bouffe pour la classe moyenne: bref, c'est pas cher, sans prétention et sans ôté à la complexité des saveurs et la «pureté» de la façon de traité les aliments en cuisine japonaise, le Nihon Bar c'est la nouvelle affaire qui gagne à grossir en nombre à Montréal car Imadake nous prouve qu'ils sont compétitif à Kazu et ont un avenir prometteur devant eux."}
{"text":"Went to Imadake yesterday for Poutine Week but they had just run out moments before we tried to order. Doesn't matter... we ordered a bunch of dishes and ginger beers; happy again. Their chicken skins were perfectly seasoned and crispier than the colonel's, the spicy shrimp tempura was battered and fried to a beautiful golden brown, octopus balls were bursting with flavour, jellyfish salad was something I had no idea could taste so wonderful... you get the point. 

Flash forward to tonight. Second attempt at Imadake poutine. Made a reservation no problems, got there, ordered. They have it. soexcited.gif. Comes to our table with a smile. Bonito flakes are dancing atop a pile of homefries, swimming with gravy and blanketed with squishy curds of that good good white stuff - curd life - the whole rested upon a shrimp and ginger pancake (like a pajun but better). Chopsticks up, forks down, poutine smiles all around. 

TL;DR Best poutine I've ever eaten. Best poutine I'll ever have."}
{"text":"Nous sommes aller, il n'y a pas si longtemps, manger chez Imadake.

Super ambiance, super décor ! Je n'avais jamais manger des ramens aussi bonnes ! La bière est également très rafraîchissante !

Un sake bomb et on aime à tout coup !"}
{"text":"3.5**
Great party atmosphere and tasty dishes. Service could be improved.

We made a reservation for two on Saturday night to celebrate my bday. After we were seated the hostess (?) told us we had to leave by 9:30. I told her that we probably wouldn't be done by then and then she said that we would have to move if that was the case. This was a big turn off for me and is a major reason why they lost stars. In the end, they didn't bother us about it but I was really unimpressed with her approach.

We ordered a bunch of dishes including fried shrimp with spicy mayo, two chicken dishes, squid...etc
We enjoyed almost all the dishes except the squid which I found pretty meh. I got a mango cocktail which was yummy.

The atmosphere there is great and fun! It's definitely loud but that's all part of the experience. We didn't do a sake bomb cause we were only two and were too scared to do it alone but had a fun time cheering along with the large group chugging drinks next to us.

The green tea cheesecake for dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal. So good! 

Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service:2/5
Value:4/5"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Came here to meet a friend for a quick lunch. Each of us had the grilled oyster mushrooms ramen with miso broth and the white fish carpaccio to share. The fish didn't look and taste fresh, like it was cut way before we ordered it. The ramen broth was so thick that it tasted more like a sauce than a soup. The mushrooms were cold and the noodles over cooked. 

Maybe some people will enjoy it at night for the sake bomb and party atmosphere but after this disaster lunch experience, I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Very great service from Don ... spicy ramen and grilled octopus were both on point!  We came for lunch but heard that evenings are fun ... sake bomb is the deal evidently."}
{"text":"We went around 10PM and it wasn't that busy. We ordered a variety of dishes, which all were really good. The edamame is only 3 dollars and the portions are very generous. Compared to where I am from (Toronto) the edamame portion are so small. My cousins also got croquettes which were really crispy and flaky, a must try if you go here!

In terms of the service, it was amazing. Lisa (2) took care of us the whole night and was always attentive and understanding to our needs at the restaurant. It's hard to find good service at restaurants now a days, but she always managed to keep a smile on her face! Will come back next time when I visit Montreal, and maybe will get some drinks next time!"}
{"text":"Hop vibe, energized staff, on point food, and a wide spectrum of drinks that complements the diverse flavors Japanese tapas offer.

definitely a Montreal pit stop for me, I always have a good time at Imadake and I'm fairly certain anyone will too!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night for dinner and it was PACKED....with very good reason!!

First the food: everything was tapas style, shareable and great drinking food.
= Highlights include octopus sashimi, ebi mayo,ramen, \"surprise\" salad with salmon sashimi and takoyaki balls
 I would honestly say 5/5 for everything I tried!

What makes this place special is the atmosphere. The only way to describe it is like drinking and eating at your best friends house. Everyone's was having a great time with the staff hyping up the party! If you haven't tried, this is THE place to predrink, or spend a weekend night. The staff will make sure you have fun and are well taken care of. By the end of the night all you will remember is screaming sake bombs at the top of your lungs banging on the tables and once in a while have the lights turned off and cheering for it to come back on. 

If you haven't tried this place do it now and you can thank me later!!;)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese place in Montreal so far. I love the beef tongue and the seared cod fish. Also, the Raman is OK though not the best. The octopus ball is tasty!"}
{"text":"Their sake bombs is real fun. :) Heard from my friends that the octobus balls was a win too! However this place is a sure No for the vegetarian ramen. My friends who ordered chicken ramen wS not impressed too !"}
{"text":"What a crowded and busy place! However, it's a great restaurant to go to for sake bombs, huge pitchers of Sapporo, and Japanese tapas plates! The environment is fun and loud, so be sure to chant as loud as you can when singing along to \"happy birthday\" or when I say sake you say bomb!\".

I would definitely come back for another round of obnoxious fun."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, fantastic menu choices from salads to ramen, good service. Is a must stop in Montreal."}
{"text":"The ramen at this place should be the standard for all ramen in Montreal. I had the spicy ramen which was so creamy and rich that the broth alone could be a soup on its own. Also, do try the green tea cheesecake! Very creamy and that added touch of salt makes me wonder why aren't all desserts salted. 

The staff are very energetic. No surprise for a place that is trendy and young. The place is very loud and perfect for a night out with buddies and friends.

This place is very busy so if you want to eat at this place I'd recommend to reserve especially if it's going to be a big group. 

Sayoonara!"}
{"text":"Super agréable. Menu style tapas mais avec des mets japonais. Place parfaite pour être en amis. Faite des réservations la fds car c'est plein."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to visit this lovely establishment last night and instantly fell in love. This place has such a great energy and it doesn't hurt that the imadake ramen is simply divine. Even though we didn't have a reservation they were able to accommodate our party of 3 and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar which gave us an opportunity to see the food prep in action. I was mesmerized by the people who work here. They have endless energy and are able to keep up with their many customers. Everything was so fast, but didn't feel rushed. It's such a sensory atmosphere, stimulating to the eyes and ears. The whole staff was so attentive and friendly. So happy I was able to experience this place and can't wait to go  back on my next visit to Montreal.

Tips:
- Make a reservation so you don't have to worry about getting a seat
- Try the Hello Kitty drink. Very good and not too sweet"}
{"text":"At some point you need to say the food here is really as good as it gets for the genre. The ramen was perfect, the mackerel was some of the best I have had. everything was very fresh.

The wait staff was on it! they were fun, attentive and joined along in the libations!"}
{"text":"Loved their Octopus balls! 
The Sake bombs were fun!! 
Not a big fan of their Chicken Ramen. But it wasn't bad!
Worth a try but would I go back?! Mmmmaybe not"}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a walk from where our hostel was located. We went specifically for some ramen after reading that theirs was pretty good. The inside of the restaurant was pretty neat and gave off a good vibe. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen. The server ended up informing us that there was a problem with our order and said that dessert was on them which was really kind, even though we didn't think we were waiting too long for our food. Once our food finally came out, I tried my ramen dish and it was very tasty! The broth was delicious and the egg was also really tasty. For dessert we had matcha ice cream. The ice cream was under what seemed to be a mochi like rice layer. All in all, it tastes really good and even though there was a problem with our order, the service was really good and the wait staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"For those of you who want to try other kinds of Japanese food, besides sushi, then head over to Imadake ASAP.
Modeled on Osaka's street food eateries, Imadake offers some wonderful hard-to-find Japanese foostuffs including melt-in-your-mouth tako yaki, Japanese deep-fried octopus balls which were just amazing. Their seafood salads were excellent also with the earthy sesame seed dressing.

The menu is cut up in two sections, those small appetizer-like dishes of which you can order many and share with a friend, think of it as Japanese tapas. The other side is the hefty Ramen noodle soups and meals. 
Desserts have the predictable green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream and black sesame ice cream, as  well as the green tea cheesecake.
Japanese beers here are resonably priced but not a lot of selection if you're a non-beer drinker.

It's a fun place to try out, I really liked the way the whole bar basically yelled out  \"Arigato\" (Thank you)  when you leave."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would give this place 4 stars if the menu wasn't so overpriced. Every dishes, or almost, come in small portions, and are not really good, just good, which is why I think that it is overpriced. Stills, ambiance is really nice, and it is definitely a good place to hang out and have fun. 
The menu offers a lot of choices, they have a vast selection of alcohol, and service is really efficient and the waiters are really nice.
The place is always busy, especially the weekend, so make sure to make a reservation (I recommend to call them 1 week in advance if you want to go during the weekend)."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service. Ramens are very tasty. And the black cod is to die for. Will come back just for that."}
{"text":"Super good. Good atmosphere. 90$ for 2 and you will still be hungry cause portions are small."}
{"text":"Les Tapas japonais les plus délicieux accompagné de cocktails parfaitement dosé et pour pimenter encore plus ma soirée, une tournée de Saké-bombe #meilleureinventiondumonde

Une place parfaite pour célébrer accompagné de ses amis !!!"}
{"text":"Almost everytime I've come here, it's been busy, with lines out the door, or some crazy wait time. Now I know why! The food is great! Don't be fooled by what seems to be small portions for what ostensibly may be 'appetizers' (you'll be surprised at how full you'll be, unless you order just one item). The staff is very accommodating, and check on you every few minutes, quite literally. Service is quick, clean, and courteous! Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a really fun place. The sitting is a little crowded so you are basically sharing a table with the people next to you. I am not sure if they did it to maximize space or part of a Japanese tradition. The outcome is that you can not help it and you will hear your neighbors conversation and they will hear yours so might not be the perfect place for a romantic dinner or a date. If you do come as a group you can actually get a big table in a less crowded area. 
The cocktails (as you can see in my picture) are great about 9$ but they taste real good and they do make them with a punch. I also had the vegetarian dumplings which were so tasty and not that expensive (about 5$). This is a cool place and I would defiantly want to re-visit it."}
{"text":"Plats style tapas japonais, appropriés pour partager en groupe. Plats très raffinés. Les boulettes de pieuvres sont succulentes! Ambiance très cool, très branchée! Commandez des sake bomb!"}
{"text":"IRASSAIMASE!

C'est ce que vous entendrez tout le personnel crier lorsque vous entrerez au pub japonais Imadake. Si vous n'êtes pas certain comment répondre un simple bonjour avec un hochement de tête et les mains en prière subtile suffira. Lorsqu'on vous assoit à votre table, ajouter un « arigato » qui veut simplement dire « merci ».

Nous avons partagé du poulet karage qui est le meilleur que j'ai goûté de ma vie. Des bons gros morceaux de poulet juteux avec un peu d'herbes et épices pour donner une bonne saveur à ces petites bouchées. La mayo au wasabi sortait de l'ordinaire et a donné du piquant au karage. Une autre entrée partagé, ressemblait à une espèce d'omelette rectangulaire avec soit du porc, des anguilles ou de fromage à l'intérieur. C'est servi avec de la sauce soya un peu comme des sushi, mais c'est chaud.

Pour le repas principal, on a pris des soupes ramen au soya avec porc et buf. Au début, c'était le meilleur bouillon au monde! Après quelques secondes à essayer de deviner l'ingrédient secret, on s'est dit que ça devait être du beurre. Environ 5 minutes plus tard, j'en avais assez de ma soupe et elle était devenue un peu trop lourde et grasse pour moi. J'en ai donc laissé la moitié, et même mon chum n'a pas terminé la sienne. Ça ne nous a pas empêché de partagé un gâteau au fromage et thé vert pour clôturer un bon repas très remplissant."}
{"text":"Great selection of vegetarian izakaya- usually hard to find. Must-haves: burdock root, oyster mushrooms, goat cheese, vegetarian dumplings. Wasn't as impressed with the larger plates (Japanese crepe, yakisoba). Fantastic selection of sake and Japanese whisky (nikka!). Fun atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée en semaine avec un groupe d'amies et on a toutes été du même avis : ce resto était vraiment super. L'ambiance était festive, avec les \"Saké. BOMB!\" hurlés de tous bords, tous côtés, et la nourriture était vraiment délicieuses.

De manière générale, j'adore le concept de petits tapas japonais à partager. Ça permet de goûter à plein d'items au menu et ça fait tellement plus convivial ! On a donc eu la chance de goûter à tout ceci :

-Tataki de boeuf
-Gindara (poisson mariné pendant 3 jours et grillé)
-Fromage de chèvre frit
-Champignons grillés
-Taki Yaki (boulettes de pieuvre frites)
-Yakisoba aux crevettes
-Gomaae (salade d'épinards)
-Salade d'algues
-Karaage (poulet frit)
-Crème glacée vanille avec mochi et purée d'edamame

Personnellement, j'ai eu un gros coup de coeur pour les boulettes de pieuvre (à essayer absolument) et le tataki de boeuf. Les cocktails qu'on a goûtés étaient aussi vraiment originaux, tant par leur saveur que par leur texture.

Seul petit point qui nous a dérangées pendant la soirée, c'est que par deux fois, le serveur nous a apporté le mauvais plat, et il nous faisait sentir chaque fois comme si c'était nous qui avions commis l'erreur lors de la commande. J'enlève donc une étoile pour ça, mais il demeure que notre expérience chez Imadake a été parmi mes meilleures à Montréal."}
{"text":"Good food, great concept! Service needs to be a little more refined! I really liked the fact that there where other choices then sushi or fish and sea food! Since I can't eat any of it! So ya can't wait for my next visit!
P.s. I'm intolerant to seafood &fish!"}
{"text":"Great birthday dinner at Imadake. This was by far the loudest eating establishment I've ever dined in but it was well worth it. We happened to be served by the manager, Reno who was so generous and nice to us. We had almost everything on the menu it seemed and it was all good. My favs were the radish salad, green salad with ginger dressing, steak, dumplings and the vanilla moche. I hope to go there again and will def say hello to Reno!

Saki BOMB!"}
{"text":"Sake! Sake! Sake! This place has great food no doubt about it. It generally served in smaller portions but there are some options for more of a full meal if you so desire. I happened to order several small plates along with a big one (I have a tapeworm i know). The rice ball was my favorite. Think of it as a pork wrapped sushi roll with unagi sauce and you got it. Great service. Great ambiance. I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food. The restaurant's aesthetic is beautiful, but it's insanely noisy and the wait staff are on the rude side."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last night by accident. The second I hit the ground, I know I've get in the right place.

The ambiance is great! If you finished a rough day, you really should come here and have some tasty-Japanese-style-bar-food pairing with some amazing sake shots.

So, it was our first time dinning here. We obviously did not have a clue what's on the menu since they translated those Japanese dish names literally into english/french. The best option for us is to have someone more experienced to guide us through the fog. Our waitress was definitely good at this and she pretty much went through everything on their menu. Fantastic job!

OK, first things first. We had \"Takowasa\" as the appetizer. It was prepared with octopus and wasabi They made it with octopus and wasabi which wakes your appetite from the deep. And for the main course, I have had a \"Gindara\", that really deserves a enormous thumb!!! Juicy , crispy,creamy, while taking some Plum wine then you'll feel them splashing in your stomach.

And something you can skip: Dashi Chazuke Eel ( $8 for two tiny pieces of eel is too much! ) , Isobe Mochi, Oba to baniku.

For keep myself in some suspense that I leave the ramen for the next time. Cause this place really deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Diner en coup de vent avant une séance de cinéma à côté, bon service rapide et bonne nourriture. On trouve tous les tapas jap habituels , un peu déçue par les ramens, mais rattrapés par les yakitoris  délicieux. Les cocktails sont bien dosés et l'ambiance général est sympa. Belle vue également sur les cuisines depuis le comptoir bar , pour tous les gens qui comme moi sont toujours curieux de voir l'effervescence de l'équipe de production. Excellente option diner dans le quartier."}
{"text":"Thank you God for hearing my prayers. Finally a truly fabulous isakaya in Montreal! 

Truly a great place to share delicious authentic Japanese food while downing sake bombs between dishes amongst friends. Decor is simple and trendy. I just wished the music was less loud as it'd be cool to hear the staff greet and thank you in Japanese when you enter/leave the restaurant like they usually do for this type of establishment.

In my own opinion, Imakade kicks Kazu's butt. I am just worried about its location. Imadake is more for the younger crowd, not the stuffy Westmount crowd that would expect overpriced sushi.

Please encourage the owners and run to this restaurant! :P"}
{"text":"Imadake is one of those places that is close to getting 5 stars from me but still needs to adjust a couple of things before I'm willing to go that far. 
Now first off I'm all too aware that all Japanese Izakiya's are suppose to be loud but I find for whatever the reason that all 3 times that I have been there it becomes annoyingly loud, last time being by far the worst with staff members that had finished their shifts sitting with friends and standing by while their friends used some pretty foul language at very loud levels. 
I also find that Imadake has a great selection on their menu but that every meal is missing that one component that could make it just perfect.
All and all I do really enjoy Imadake but feel they need to still tweak a couple of things before they get a perfect 5 from me."}
{"text":"Ma place de choix pour des partys de groupe!!! SAKE BOMB!!! Garanti pour amener le sourire aux lèvres de tout le monde sur la table! Pour ceux qui ignore ce qu'est un sake bomb, c'est une bière sur laquelle ils déposent une paire de baguette sur lesquelles ils déposent un shooter de sake. Ensuite le serveur enchaîne des cris 'When I say Sake' et nous répliquons 'BOMB' à quatres reprises!!! Au dernier bomb, on cogne sur la table pour faire tomber le sake dans la bière et on cale le tout!!!!

Et le Imadake est une isakaye en soi, en d'autres mots, un bar japonais où on peut boire bière, cocktails, liqueurs forts tout en accompagnant le tout de bouchées à partager! 

À essayer:
- Takoyaki - boules frites de pieuvres 
- Okonomiyaki aux fruits de mer - omelette garni de morceaux de fruits de mer
- Ramen au char siu
- Chicken skin (super croustillant comme des chips pour accompagner ta bière!)
- si dispo, la salade de tofu, vraiment fraîche qui vous fera changer votre opinion sur le tofu!
- comme dessert, crème glacée mochi au thé vert!!!!

Vous gagnez à y aller à plusieurs, comme tous les restaurants de plats à partager! Et lorsque vous passez à la salle de bain en bas, laissez un petit mot sur l'ardoise comme souvenir ;)"}

{"text":"Quick Japanese lesson for everyone:
IMADAKE means \"only now\"
I guess that this is a fitting name due to 2 reasons: 
1. the YOLO attitude when it comes to drinking here. Everyone (mostly everyone) was having a good time getting blasted here.
2. Possibly because of the limited time food special that they have. 
Whatever your theory about the name, this place is a real find! I was surprised to find real Japanese food in Montreal. 
During my tine in Montreal, it was apparent that they love sushi. Of course 90% of it is Americanized/Canadianized which is not appealing to me.
Jonzing for rice and a taste of the motherland I ventured to this place.
To my surprise the food here is pretty authentic. I won't say that it's straight out the motherland but pretty close for being 7000 miles away! Just in case you don't know I am super picky when it comes to Japanese food. I am all about authenticity when it comes to my home food so any seal of approval on authenticity is a HUGE seal of approval.. If you don't like it, go back to your favorite teriyaki hole.  

I was by myself so I just picked off of the izakaya menu. 

Tori no kawa (chicken skin) was nice and crispy w/ lots of flavor. It was served in appetizer format vs the traditional kushi style (on a stick)

Char-Siu ramen was actually very tasty and chocked full of char siu. Borderline motherland legit (Yes, this is a awesome compliment). 


Outside of the food, this seems like a hip place to take a few friends to kill a few brain cells with sake bombs. During my visit all I could hear was tables slamming and people chanting Sake Bomb, Sake Bomb.... 

Anyhow this place is about as close to Japan I got during my stay in Montreal. Come here for a good time and real Japanese food."}
{"text":"Loud, fun and the food is great. Japanese style tapas."}
{"text":"Happily visited again and I still love them. Tuna tataki is extremely delicious. So soft and tender, and the sauce complements the tuna very well. Mutely flavourful.

Takowasa is still my favourite dish from Imadake. I've had takowasa in other restaurants but not nearly as delicious as here! And only $5!! It is tiny but worth it. Their ratio of wasabi and octopus sashimi is perfect.

I don't order takoyaki anymore because I concluded that North America cannot make delicious takoyaki. But they do make decent takoyaki here! Not perfect but they're quite alright.

Desserts are absolutely delicious.

I find the price for the food is 100% + 100% worth the value. Actually the prices are cheap for such good food! Ramen is only $13??? And it's surprisingly a big bowl! The bowl looks shallow but it's hallow all the way to the bottom with LOTS of noodles. 

Spicy ramen is like clear broth + spice. I didn't love the rare beef in the beef ramen, but the pork belly in my spicy ramen is soooooooo delicious. The first ramen on the menu (Imadake ramen) is the best.

Service is A+++++++!!!!

Sake bombs can become quite loud with the chanting and hammering of tables. The restaurant is vivid with energy all night long!

Side note, I wholeheartedly agree with Jason M that the food does not compare to Guu. Yes indeed Imadake is for the sake bombs and the late night snacking!!"}
{"text":"Dear, sweet Imadake, how I love you. 

I've been to Imadake enough times that I feel self-conscious about it. Imadake has given me a love of octopus balls and yuzu beer cocktails. Yuzu is a sour japanese orange / a magic spell you cast on shitty beer in order to make tasty. 

Also, that sweet, sweet, porc belly ramen with the thick and hearty, spicy broth. I don't think i've ever left my ramen bowl with anything in it, broth or otherwise, when I've visited Imadake.

Imadake may be my favourite restaurant in the city, particularly during the week or on Sunday nights when its a little less packed. 

If you haven't gone to Imadake you really, really should."}
