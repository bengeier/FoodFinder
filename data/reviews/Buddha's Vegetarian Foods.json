{"text":"We've been a loyal fan of BV's food for many years. The food is absolutely delicious but be warned that it's also very greasy. Keeps you mindful that eating  vegetarian is not always very healthy! My favs are the hot & sour soup and mock duck. The owners changed some 2-3 years ago, prices were increased by a slight bit, but the quality of food is even better. Excellent value for your buck too!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and value. This is our favourite vegetarian place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Authentic Cantonese cooking and healthy good food, these are the two features that bring me back again and again.  All noodles dishes are great.  I have yet to try their main course dishes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on a recommendation. We just finished and wanted to write a review.   Wow, Wow, Wow!  We are astounded at the quality, quantity, and price, along with fantastic, friendly service!!  We originally sat down and ordered a spring roll to share, which was HUGE, definitely the largest spring roll I have ever seen in my life. It was delicious  What really surprised us in a great way was seeing the first noodle dish - for 8 bucks there was enough to feed four of us at least!  The black bean eggplant was my favourite - who some warms and succulent. Their signature fried fish has a presentation that is remarkable - cast on a hot iron and then covered in a homemade seasons garlic that is to be dreamed of.   We are two adults and ordered 3 dishes - we have  enough leftover to feed us for another 3-4 sittings.   It's amazing.    Also the helpful customizations by the boss, Sammy, was really helpful. We didn't want mushrooms and he automatically cleared it from all our dishes as well as the fungi, replacing it with tofu.   Best part? For vegans Sammy is really on top. Some places miss eggs in their chowmein noodles. This place doesn't.   And the biggest question for many of us? Yes they speak fluent English.   I'm now gonna be a regular."}
{"text":"THE best chinese vegetarian food for the best price. I kid not, $20 will feed 2 people for 3 days. The sweet and sour gluten, hot and sour soup and e-fu noodles are to die for. They don't chince out on veggies (or anything, really) and their staff are always super friendly and welcoming. You'll be so busy stuffing your face you won't realize there isn't any meat in sight."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to me a few years ago, and boy do I owe her for introducing me to this gem. As many have already pointed out, it's a hole in the wall kind of place, but the fact that it's full of people every day speaks volumes to the quality and tastiness of food that awaits to reward those willing to look past the unassuming decor and give this place a try.  My favourite is the king mushroom and seafood fried noodle and hot and sour soup. When I bring non-veggie friends, they love the General Tao chicken and are amazed how close it comes to the real thing. I also love the mock duck... it doesn't actually remind me of duck in taste at all (so probably not one for fooling a meat eating buddy), but still is super delicious.  The staff are really friendly and this is one of my absolute top choice for Asian vegetarian fare and you'll find me there practically every week."}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago, very nice veggie restaurant. If going with meat-eating friends, there will be more than enough dishes to make everyone happy.  Pretty small, but nice family vibe. Food came out for me SUPER quick and it was all fresh and tasty. Got the General Tao's chicken and Fried rice noodles with beef and black bean sauce.   Staff was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"cheap, huge portions, tons of choices. they can accommodate any size party, and take out means only a ten minute wait.   you can complain about lack of ambiance here, but it has it's own kind of charm. the people who work there are so nice.   the only downside is it's sooo greasy. the huge portions mean you'll probably stuff yourself and feel sick the next day. my tip: bring some tupperware and pack it up before you over-eat.   this is a great place to take a bunch of visitors; they'll love the laid back atmosphere and huge portions for cheap. who doesn't?"}
{"text":"Awesome prices, friendly staff, lots of options for both vegan's and vegetarians, and an obscene amount of food. I'm not exaggerating here; ordered the mixed vegetables with mushrooms, gluten, and noodles and honestly had enough food to spare for three days! What more could you want!"}
{"text":"Mock meat paradise, been there for a long time and while it isn't the healthiest food on earth it will satisfy that occasional desire to go down memory lane and eat like you were a kid again. Simple decor but clean and nice, inexpensive."}
{"text":"Great food in a \"hole in the wall\" type of place. The tables and chairs are nothing fancy and squeezed into a very small space that could use another coat of paint -- it's quite crowded if more than a few people are eating. But the food. That's why you're here, right? It's largely very healthy, not too greasy or oily, and all vegetarian with many authentic Chinese dishes. Mm, yummy! And it's very affordable too. A great selection, including fake \"meats\" and \"seafoods\", in addition to vegetables. For example, I had the soft boiled turnip with shiitake mushrooms and veggie-beef, which was not quite a stew, not quite a \"dry\" dish, but delicious nonetheless.   If you're looking for better ambiance (for a family gathering or other large group, or a date), then head to Greens Vegetarian, which is almost next door. But from the food perspective, both places are delicious -- slightly different styles, so try them both!"}
{"text":"I put my review under tip not sure if it's same as review but here we go again lol...I like the generous amount of food they give, to me food can be a little tastier everything was pretty bland. I still would recommend this to everyone as as everyone has different taste buds, good experience and we got 6 dishes for $40 so you can't go wrong...but my favorite place is still graceful vegetarian restaurant by pacific mall. I gave this review a 4 star because the service was good and fast, portions were very big for the price and taste...well to each it's own..hope that helps."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I've got to say it's going to be one of my favourites. It's absolutely delicious and super authentic as far as I can tell! Everything is vegan except for this one mock fish dish which I happened to pick first, but had to change my order. I ordered a mock beef pad noodle dish and my friend did as well but with different sauces. The food came relatively fast and the serving was HUGE! I eat a lot, regardless of my small size, and it was filling even for me. My friend couldn't even finish her dish! Everything was super affordable (I'm pretty cheap). Definitely worth the trip and money! I'm 90% sure its family run so please tip well!   Also, the people were soo nice to us! I would eat here weekly if I could!"}
{"text":"3.5 for taste but bumped up to 4 because of portion and value. Small family run restaurant with not much to offer in decor. However, the food is tasty, fulfilling  and piping hot.  Rice and noodle are a high here. Their signature dish is also good on a hot skillet. Soup, I would skip. Otherwise, a great place."}
{"text":"This place has huge, delicious portions for little money.  I love all of their mushroom dishes.  They have an interesting taste because Buddhist vegetarian cuisine avoids certain ingredients, garlic and onions are top of mind, so it has unique taste unto itself.  I recently came back here with family after years of being away and it was just as good as I remembered.  I think they may have expanded into the building next door too which is great news because they're always busy."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.   Greasy? A little bit. Sketchy? Yeah, maybe. Value? ABSOLUTELY.  We read all of the reviews, and they all said that the portions were big, but man, they are HUGE.  We ordered two different styles of noodles, two spring rolls and a side of steamed rice. It was heavy just carrying it the few blocks back to our apartment.   The Curry fried vermicelli noodles were delicious. Not just \"good for the price\" like I expected. I think this is a good choice for somebody who might find some of the other dishes \"bland\" (since there is no onions or garlic) since the other flavours and spices really make up for it.  Some other guy referred to the spring rolls as \"spring logs\" and I found that to be an accurate statement. They were greasy but nothing a pat with a paper towel can't fix, and man were they good. I'm not even a huge fan of spring rolls.   Next time I'm going to eat in. The old ladies who helped us were so sweet and nice."}
{"text":"Price as always is pretty good. Since ownership changed hands a few months ago, it seems that some new dishes are on the menu (like lemon chicken..). The spring rolls are massive, and oily. But addictive. I think it's the only reason I would go here instead of Greens, which is just a block away. I asked for less oil (Buddha's veggies/tofu), and the dish was a lot less oily than usual. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask for no MSG, and my cheeks are still flushed!  Greens is still my number one choice downtown for veggie chinese, but at least there are two options.. (I guess..)"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for greasy, plentiful veggie eats, it's a great choice! I definitely have a soft spot for the imitation duck."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have been coming here for years and the food is consistently good.   If you are in the mood for Chinese but can't handle the grease or MSG this is your spot. It's vegan/veggie but meat eaters will love it to. Honest truth, my partner doesn't do vegetarian but he will eat here.   My partner and I always get the spring rolls, mock beef and noodles, and sweet and sour mock chicken (they are like chicken balls but vegetarian). I have also tried many of their soups and eggplant.   Give it a try! You wont be disappointed, plus you get to support a local small business...win-win!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends and relatives and today is the first time I don't have to wait for a table :) perfect timing on a sunny day.   Food was great and the portions were huge as usual; we tried the two new dishes on the menu - General Tao Chicken and Gluten with black bean sauce on pan fried noodle.  I agreed with the other reviewers here that it's the price and big portion of food that bring me back here, but have to admit that the new owner has put an effort in improving the taste and variety of the dishes.   We enjoyed our meal very much today; the General Tao Chicken is still a bit greasy for me, but my friends cleaned it all up. The black bean sauce tasted great, not that salty and both dishes were fresh and hot, We have a little chat with the chef/owner who informed us that more new dishes are on the way... Yummy. I hold on to the Five Stars, hoping the food won't disappoint me the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"What Buddha's lacks in style and decor, it certainly makes up for in quality, quantity and definitely value, which is why it remains one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto.  I will admit that the fact that it's been around for a while may influence my nostalgic biases but really, where else are you going to find a dish you can eat for a week or one that feeds 5 people for 5 bucks? I've gone with three strapping young men who not even put a dent in two dishes.   Although the selection is the old standard Chinese fare, the vegetarian aspect is a HUGE and awesome checkmark in my opinion, one that I think it is severely lacking in other cities I've lived in (Vancouver, New York). Plus, you can veto the MSG upon request.   I recommend the gigantor spring rolls, spicy tofu dish, imitation duck sheets and noodles with three types of mushrooms. They close at 9pm most days and are completely closed on Tuesdays, making Tuesdays now the saddest day of the week (luckily I have leftovers)."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Food wasn't the tastiest on the planet, ingrendients were good."}
{"text":"My partner and I ordered the green bean and olive leaves with a Buddha's deluxe on rice noodles. She's been here twice already this week! Our go-to for home cooked Chinese vegetarian like your grandma made it. So good.... Big servings and the price is always right."}
{"text":"just came back from dinner here, we were absolutely newbies to this place. the place itself is very quiet, the service was very good, so friendly, they even came to explain us the difference between our plate and the one from the table besides us. the food couldnt be better. but i must warn u if u are looking for a nice, fancy place THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO. as everyone says the portions are HUGE!  we had:  1. 4 spring rolls 2. lemon chicken 3. fake duck  spring rolls, very good, thicker than usual. lemon chicken, wow! very tasty and the vegetables so yummy. the fake duck, it was ok, i wouldnt order that again, is not that is not good, just that im not use to that kind of texture.   they serve you jazmine tea as soon as u walk in the door, which was great, as outside was a bit chilly.  forgot to say, the order was for 2 and it came up to $18 (without tip), we were full and even took a lot home.  definitely we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Cheap, large portions, lots of noodles.  You'll have leftovers for the week.  As noted by the other reviewers the taste is kind of bland.  You might want to add some hot sauce or pepper."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 6. We were a part of 5 and ordered 4 dishes. The food was pretty good, the stir fried green beans were my favorite. Prices are around $11 per dish. Bill came to $50 plus tip. The decor is dated but I would come again."}
{"text":"This place has the biggest portions that I've ever seen. I can pride myself on eating a ton, but couldn't finish even half of a serving at Buddha's.  I've been coming here for years and the food is predictable. Lots of noodles, veggies, mushrooms, tofu. It's best to come with several people and get a few dishes and some soup too. You will fill up and have leftovers for under $10 per person."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a great hole-in-the-wall type of joint. The portions are huge and you can't beat the prices. I wish they would accept more than just cash, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. Service is pretty good. I've had some problems in the past that have always been quickly resolved. The food is always good. I've never been disappointed with any dish. The place is kinda dingy and small, but I kinda dig it. If you're picky about decor then maybe check out Green's down the street, but you will pay more for less food."}
{"text":"When you only have $6 and you're starving, this is the place to go. It's certainly not fancy, some of the dishes are not my favourite, but the ones that are are definitely worth your money. Order the mock duck."}
{"text":"Been my family's go to vegetarian place before the owner's change. Food I find isn't as amazing but still one of the best Chinese vegetarian locations. There are some new items on their menu that were not there before the change and they are pretty unique like the vegetarian \"fish\" dish there is a sweet and sour version as well as a savory version. Both are unique and new.  Recommend the vegetarian duck"}
{"text":"My family and I have been regulars here for the last 10+ years. Generous portions of very tasty and balanced vegetarian foods. Service is also fast."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and very filling! Their spring rolls with taro filling were to die for. Their stir fry string beans were also very good. The eggplants could be a little bit saltier but it wasn't a big issue. We also got general tsao's chicken and although the flavour was on point for that one, the batter on the \"chicken\" was way too thick and doughy. It is a pretty small place though and very popular, so it might be tough to get seats on busier days"}
{"text":"Excellent Vegetarian Chinese, not a super fancy place but large portions of freshly made quality food for low prices keeps me coming back.  Staff are friendly, service is great, English is a bit weak but that's what comes with authentic Chinese food.  Would highly recommend this restaurant with the Vegetarian Duck being a personal favorite."}
{"text":"A great option for vegetarians when you're craving Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"This is the most affordable vegetarian restaurant - scratch that - the most affordable restaurant downtown.  Prices are fantastic, portions are generous, and staff are nice."}
{"text":"When you're hungry everything almost always taste good so my group and I brought our hangry selves to BVF for lunch when got to Toronto via car via a very windy (25mph) and cold day.   We ordered:   - crispy noodles with veggies  - three veggie spring rolls  - one taro roll  - vegetable soup noodle  - imitation duck (small plate)  Having had duck before choosing to be a herbivore I know what it taste like, and I think they did a pretty good job with the flavor  The soup noodle was fine. Crispy noodle was good until you get to the soggy parts under the sauce - I should've ask them not to add the tapioca starch as another yelp reviewer did. It was not appetizing to chew through a bok choy with it squirting out.   The veggie spring roll was crispy on the outside and would've been good but I think it's either the combo of veggies they used or the oil it was fried in that gave it a strange after taste. The taro roll was delicious - I wished I ordered more of this than the spring rolls.   The restaurant is split into rooms and we sat in the room around the back from the entrance. It didn't do any good to keep us warm, we were eating in our jackets."}
{"text":"Me: ...and a spring roll please. Chinese lady: Ok, no problem. Me: Oh, and could you please make it with less oil? Her: ... Well, it's deep-fried... Me: Oh. Right. Okay then.  Eating here reminds me that vegetarian ain't necessarily healthy. But, grease aside, it's a lot for pretty good value (though to be fair any dish without meat should theoretically be cheaper), it's close, and it's good enough to get by on a vegetarian day. I guess the main appeal of a place like this (as opposed to any other place in Chinatown) is that you get more variety as a vegetarian. Nevertheless, I usually only come when I'm craving hot and sour soup (which in non-veg restos sometimes has meat hidden in it), since most of their other dishes are like mom's with extra oil.   I will be back on the odd Wednesdays, when (sorry Buddha!) the somewhat less oily, tastier, and more appealing Greens down the block is closed."}
{"text":"The food was great! We ordered the Buddha's Deluxe ($9) and we asked no tapioca starch, and we loved the dish. The stir fried vermicelli were 90% noodles, so it's more of an accompaniment. If you do order it, also get a vegetables dish. The service was good, they were very friendly. And just FYI, the ambiance of the place is not great. It's more of a take-out place really. Don't take a date here :P  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place serves vegan monastery type food with no onion or garlic. It's a solid steady choice, and I have been going to this restaurant for possibly 20 years now. It's not going to set the world on fire with it's experimental cutting edge cuisine, and it is not a romantic date night place unless you are both young starving artists/vegans. It's the sort of place for large quantities of comfort food, that can easily shared amongst a group of people and there's generally a lot of mushrooms. The staff have always been helpful, and probably know me and my family by sight now as my son has always loved their hot and sour soup from when he was a very small child."}
{"text":"Cheap eats, huge portions, and fast service when you're not in the mood to go anywhere or pay for anything fancy. Under new management, things seem to be the same other than new menu items.   Food: I haven't tried anything that I don't like. The chow mein is classic, and the general tao chicken satisfies my cravings, but my favourite has got to be the sizzling fish for sure!   Service: they're friendly and they speak English (perk when you're in Chinatown area)   Ambiance: I wouldn't go here for a first date but if it's an easy going date I might go here for a second date."}
{"text":"In terms of portions, they're definitely performing. We ordered four plates between three people and there was a LOT left over! Ok top of that we ordered three spring rolls and three small bowls of rice and it all came up to $50. Really decent. And if you're going out with friends it's great because you can share with the table.  I don't know if I see the appeal in taste as much. It wasn't bad but I didn't find it to be very flavourful. I didn't like the fact that the spring rolls we're so oily - they could have let a paper towel soak some of it up before serving. The mock shrimp and the cashew fried veggie plate were what I enjoyed most."}
{"text":"Came here after a recommendation from a good friend of mine who used to come here often when she was living in the neighbourhood.   If I got this right, this place is an institution in Toronto. It has been around for awhile.   Small, clean and very cosy despite a scarce decor if compared to what Toronto is getting used to.   I'm a man of substance: what's superfluous, is not needed.  Presentation a part (and with that I mean that I don't need a Van Gogh in my plate), I eat with my mouth, not my eyes.  I start saying that I'm not a vegetarian restaurant kinda guy. I love meat and I'm pleased when there's some sort of presence in my plate.  But since I went to Vietnam and I had the pleasure to fine with locals in some of the restaurants that weren't serving meat at all, I discovered that a vegetarian meal isn't too bad if it's cooked properly.   So here's what I had today for lunch: - small sweet and sour vegeterian soup with tofu - deep fried dumplings - deep fried tofu with bok choy and mushrooms on a bed of crispy noodles.   Everything was cooked very well. The ingredients tasted fresh and the preparation was quicker than a \"meal\" at Mac Donald (and that's fast food by definition.....hmmmm, I wonder)  Staff was prompt and very friendly and ready to have a quick conversation with you.   SOUL FOOD.   Will visit again."}
{"text":"quick service. i appreciate the owner being quirky. the food was in big portion which delighted me"}
{"text":"Literally been coming here since I've been in the womb , nothing bad to say about this place ever ! The food is amazing and you get so much for an amazing price"}
{"text":"This is not your fancy white-cloth restaurant. The moment you walk in, you will wonder where you will eat since there are only 2-3 small tables at the front. Then you are led through their kitchen/prep area to the back, where there are more tables. This 2min journey kinda reminded me of going down narrow alleyways in Hong Kong to find a hidden eatery stall.  The food here is vegan/vegetarian friendly. For 4 people, we ordered the imitation duck (small), fried rice, fried tofu with imitation pork, general tao chicken and fried taro.   I really liked the imitation duck and the tofu. However, as a omnivore, the imitation pork tasted really weird and unnatural. As for the general tao chicken, it was (as someone previously mentioned) basically your typical canadian-chinese chicken ball and red sauce. I suggest they could change the name to reflect what it is. Finally the fried rice and taro were tasty!  There is limited parking in front of the restuarant (city parking). However, if you are frugal, there is free street side parking on the street one block east of the restuarant. Overall, this place has a great bang for your buck. $40 for 4 people and we were barely able to finish everything."}
{"text":"Possibly the best value for your money you will spend at a restaurant in Toronto. The dishes are low priced, and not just that, but the serving sizes are huge. One dish should be eaten by two hungry people or three not so hungry people. Seriously. If you go alone, bring a Tupperware container for leftovers.   I don't like everything on the menu. But there are some gems I love that are so delicious, just writing this review is making me hungry!! The rice noodles and gluten are a favourite. So is the dish with cashews and green peppers. The vegetarian-duck is the best I've tasted anywhere.   They used to have the most amazing spring rolls, but unfortunately they changed them for a lesser version recently. But this place still gets 5 stars for its amazing value and yummy dishes."}
{"text":"Great good, lots of options. Me and my friend had the general tao chicken and chicken curry, with a side of rice. The chicken curry was nothing special but the general tao was really good. All the mock chicken I've tried so far had an odd flavour but I was pleased to see that the chicken here did not have that fake chicken flavour.  I'm excited to come back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Looking for enough leftover Chinese food to last you all next week? Go here. The portions are MASSIVE. This cannot be overemphasized. A 'small' soup practically comes in a bucket with a ladle. My dad, sister and I (ignorant saps that we were) each ordered a starter and a main course -- and the waitress didn't warn us we were doing it all wrong. We certainly felt like clowns when the food came out. It's Hong Kong style, people, so we should've ordered one starter and one main to share. And we still might've had leftovers. The soups were tastier than the mains, which all seemed to be coated in the same 'brown sauce'. They must have giant vats of brown sauce in the back. In my opinion, nearby Chinese vegetarian restaurant Greens makes better food, in smaller portions."}
{"text":"The only thing I can compare this to is Greens and I have to say for value and portions this place wins hands down. Only one bad experience from here and it was a large order of cold bean curd sheets either than that can't complain large portions and they're very fast with take out orders"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I've got to say it's going to be one of my favourites. It's absolutely delicious and super authentic as far as I can tell! Everything is vegan except for this one mock fish dish which I happened to pick first. I ordered a mock beef pad noodle dish and my friend did as well but with different sauces. The food came relatively fast and the serving size was HUGE! I eat a lot despite my small frame, and it was even filling for me; my friend couldn't even finish her dish! Everything was super cheap, ~$10 will definitely fill you up. It's 100% worth the trip and money! I also think it's a family run restaurant so please tip well!   Also, the people were soo nice to us! I would eat here weekly if I could!"}
{"text":"The sausages tasted nothing like meat but yet SOO GOOD. If I had a choice I'd choose this over normal sausage. The general tsos chicken was mostly balls of dough but with the sauce it came out delicious. Normally love my meat dishes but this restaurant is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This has been my family's new favourite vegetarian restaurant for the past 4 years or so.  We used to go to Simon's Wok for over 15 years but noticed they had a decline in respect to flavour, quality and portion size.  My aunt brought us here a few years ago and we absolutely fell in love with this place.   The portions for some dishes tend to run on the larger end which is good if you go with a big group but not ideal if you go with just 1 or 2 other people as you can't order too many dishes to try (unless you don't mind taking out a lot of leftovers).    I always appreciate that their dishes are lighter in flavour, not greasy/oily compared to other vegetarian restaurants.  The prices are so cheap so we tip a lot.  The inside of the restaurant is very much so small, lacking in any sort of decor, very cozy, family like but the amazing food makes you not even think the mentioned a bad thing at all!  We don't live in the area but when we are nearby this is the place to be for vegetarian.  I only wish they were closer to Markham :)"}
{"text":"Pros: authentic vegetarian Hong Kong style Chinese food. I ordered the general tso chicken and the small vegetarian doc sheet.  A lot of food. Ate half and took the rest home for lunch the next day.  Inexpensive. Great value.  Cons: staff is a little standoffish."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese vegetarian food. Mushroom extravaganza. Great service. Zero decor or ambience. Insanely low price. Huge portions. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant because of all the excellent reviews it gets here. The food is quite good when it comes to taste and ingredients. But having been to many vegetarian restaurants all over the world, I must say that the dishes did not wow me. It is somewhat disappointing that the locals seemed to have rated the restaurant based largely on price and quality. On those two, this restaurant is a clear winner. I had a party of seven and ordered a good selection of dishes which we could not finish. The bill came to under $80. Everyone was surprised.  I understand that the owner has no intention of turning the restaurant into a high-end one, and that the local customers seem happy with the no-frill arrangement. Still, I wish the restaurant could pay more attention to other details such as seating, decor and hygiene. As much as I liked the food and the friendly service, I did not enjoy the environment - cramped, windowless, clunky tables and chairs, weird layout.  The rival restaurant down the road has table cloths, glass window and a much more sensible seating arrangement. I was told that you don't get as much value for the money. But if I can't finish the food with the giant portion anyway, it makes no difference and I will indeed give this other restaurant a try next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Most delicious yet inexpensive Chinese restaurant I have been to. Would recommend hot and sour soup, imitation duck, stir-fried cashew nuts and vegetables (*with a bowl of steamed white rice) and e-fu noodles with vegetables. I just wish the restaurant was not lacking enough air-conditioning. It's difficult to drink hot and sour soup in 30 degree weather!"}
{"text":"Huge portions! So filling!  Ginger mock beef  was amazing.  I hadthe pepper mock gfish. Tasted like real fish.  Fills up quickly  but orders come fast.  It was ome of the best vegan I have ever had in Toronto"}
{"text":"I can't believe I went to this place for my one dinner out in Toronto. It was fine. For vegetarian Chinese. But that's as complimentary as saying it was fine for vegan food or fine for Kosher food or fine for Halal food. As in it was fine for a restaurant that has chosen to restrict itself significantly in terms of its ingredients. For us carnivores, it's just OK. For anyone avoiding meat, it might be great. I couldn't really say."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by this tiny little restaurant and it's lack of decor!  This is the best example of Chinese vegetarian food in a \"hole-in-the-wall\" setting.  Think of it as a home that has been converted to a Chinese restaurant - no gaudy decorations, just a simple shrine and a cold case and a couple of chairs and tables.  I don't know about you, but when I think of vegetarian, I think \"gimmick\" and \"overpriced\" and \"small portions\".  This is not the case in this eatery.  The food is very reasonably priced and the portions are huge.  Most of the time, I go in, and I come out with a couple of day's worth of food.  Wanna know what to Order Here? 1)  The Marinated Seitan:  This is what's hanging out in the cold case by the door.  There's sweet and sour, spicy curry, and mock duck.  Everything here is fresh and pretty tasty.  (Seitan = using gluten to make fake meat for the texture....)  2)  Hot and Sour Soup:  Okay, this is the star of the show.  Delicious, rich, and a lot of umami (savoury) flavours.  It's great for people who miss the meat, because this is a great meaty tasting dish - although the spice level can blow your head off sometimes.  3)  Three Kinds Mushroom Chow Mein:  This eatery knows how to toast the noodles on both sides for better crunch, and also, this is a lot of mushrooms on the stuff.  If you thought you didn't like mushrooms, think again!  This eatery is definitely not a \"first date\" experience, but it's a great place to hang out with close friends or on a budget.  (Watch out for the entrance and the steps of the storefront, I've actually slipped and slid on this multiple times!)  *  This eatery is not accessible to people using mobility adaptive equipment - it's way too small for most of these devices to be used!"}
{"text":"True definition of a hole-in-the-wall eatery and, yes, the servings are insanely generous - first timers are always shocked when they see the portions. The mock meats, wheat gluten and stir-fry items are fairly average, but their noodles, spring rolls and hot and sour soup are quite decent. The food isn't addictive, but it's the value and health quotient that draw customers back. A great takeout venue."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and super affordable! The owner (?) is incredibly friendly - a lovely person. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Buddha's Vegetarian Restaurant is not much to look at from the outside.  It's located in Kensington/Chinatown area of Toronto.  It's an easy drive from the center of town since all you have to do is drive east on Dundas.  Lots of mock meat dishes.  My favorites are items # 61 - Soya Beef Brisket, Mushroom & Turnip in special sauce.  The dish was a spot on representation of beef brisket cooked in a clay pot with turnips.  I also liked # 19 - Imitation Duck with Vegetables.  The Mock Duck is essentially bean curd sheets rolled up to recreate the texture of duck.  The Braised E-Fu Noodles with Vegetables and Mushroom #  37 was excellent without the added oil that is usually a feature of this dish.  The Spicy Ma Po Tofu # 12 was the one dish that missed the mark.  The Ma Po Tofu did not have the flavor nor the ground porky texture of the traditional dish.  The dishes were all low fat and appeared to be prepared without garlic.  Overall, I enjoyed this meal very much."}
{"text":"I love this place. You can tell they are passionate about their food and live by the same principles in which they cook and serve. Amazing hot and sour soup. Vegetarian comfort food at it's best. I like having the option to chose if I want to eat healthy or if I want to pig out on their fake meat gluten items. I usually do both :/ true story."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been exploring vegetarian and vegan options in Toronto. We both eat meat but try to minimize the amount we have per week.   The restaurant is no frills and isn't very big- there's a dining area in the front and another in the back. Nonetheless, it's usually busy and for good reason.   The food itself tastes great and is cooked well. I really like the imitation duck and vegetables. It makes you feel like you're having a cheat meal but you're not. Most of the dishes have a great amount and variety of vegetables- something sometimes hard to come by in vegetarian/vegan restaurants without paying ridiculous prices.   Speaking of which...we ordered 3 items thinking that this was being conservative...we could only finish one and the other two looked untouched. You get a HUGE amount of food for extremely reasonable prices. I am actually going to make this a weekly meal prep option because it is as healthy and cheaper than making my own food.   The owner is also incredibly sweet! I wouldn't be surprised if they have a lot of regulars because of this as well.   We will definitely be getting food from here often and recommend it to our friends!"}
{"text":"I really REALLY like the food here. Everything is fresh and well prepared. The \"meats\" you get are gluten and soy based goodness that you cant stop eating. lots of flavor and hot HOT plates!  I had the cantonese fried noodles, hot and sour soup, and usually some version of veggie tofu stirfry. get stuffed and you will have SOOO much left over. the food portions here are unbelievable. i always have lunch to take the next day, and dinner again maybe.   The food here deserves five starts! The shop, not so much. it looks a bit ... run-down. virtually no decorations and not.. very clean looking. if you can get over that it's a fantastic place to be.   go with someone that can read chinese, or has been there before. the english menu looks very strange.. the whole page is filled with \"white fungus\" \"black moss\"... i think that kind of scares people. they are mushroom and delish i promise!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of a hole in the wall restaurant! It doesn't look like much from outside and when you come in to sit down you might think something negative. However, you just gotta wait and then this little place will work it's magic.  Food: 5/5 The food is amazing and majority if not all is vegan. It's honestly hard to find vegan food this good! The food honestly makes up for the lack of atmosphere since it's very much like it's meat options in taste.   Service: 5/5  I'm not sure of the one guy's name but if you go often enough he is ALWAYS there and could possibly be the manager/owner. He is the NICEST guy EVER! He is always smiling, joking, and just all around a great guy. We once had to wait a little longer for our order, which wasn't a problem but he gave us a free spring roll to make up for it.   If you haven't gone or walked away because of the outside... I URGE YOU TO GO AND TRY IT! Honestly I always recommend this restaurant to anyone who is vegan or thinking about it. Also, I just recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves Chinese food."}
{"text":"A good friend recommended this place and even though I am no fan of meatless meat substitute...aka...highly processed tofu....meat vegetarian restaurants? Yeah, something like that. I never really understood the rationale behind making stuff taste like something that it's not but hey all I care about is if it just tastes good. Now, only if something can make kale taste like butter I would gladly truckloads of this stuff :D  I really don't know what I am eating to be honest even though I really know it's just all tofu or soy protein and a lot of vegetables. However, whatever it was meant to be did not matter because this stuff is delicious. While I wouldn't say this stuff has gotten me thinking about becoming a vegetarian anytime soon, it certainly has made tofu quite oddly delicious.  This stuff kinda tastes like the real thing (a bit frightening)...except it's not. Shrimp is... kinda shrimpy. Chicken...is kinda chicken-like and mystery meat is...well meaty. It's the preparations that I am raving about. Everything seems to be cooked to perfection and tastes kinda like the real thing.  Price wise is fair but the portions are out of whacked! Way too big! So order less than what you would normally order.  Oh yeah, avoid the Lemon Chicken; a bunch of yellow, soggy, balls of flour."}
{"text":"One of our faves. Reliable food for vegans and vegetarians. They revamped the menu a few years ago, making some slightly more interesting dishes. We've always liked it, and that hasn't changed. The bossy Chinese Grandmothers are awesome. They make me feel at home."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to reopen for a while now. I have visited the place several times to see if it was open only to be greeted by the hand written sign that it was closed.  By complete fluke, I finally got there - and with the person who had originally introduced me to their goodness.  I made the ultimate mistake of ordering my own dish + some spring rolls. I justified this action by saying to him, \" I am starving - and you know, even when I'm just nippish, I eat a lot - so I am sure I can do this seeing that I am STARVING.\"  When the food arrived, my tummy started jumping up and joy for food - there was quite a lot, but no worries, I was starving.  OMGosh there were so many mushrooms of different kinds, I was in love. Even better was that it didn't look or taste all that fried.  GREAT spring rolls. VERY VERY HOT. do NOT touch until 5 full minutes pass by otherwise you WILL burn your mouth.  As i start digging in to the main dish,  I realize that the tiny little dish must be magical because I KEEP EATING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FOOD.  awesome hot sauce - goes well with the noodles...the bok choy and....well, everything.  SO. MUCH FOOD.   I was so full with goodness  - I had to get the rest of'em to go, with lots of hot sauce. I really was scared that the food will start spilling from my eyes, that I walked looking up for a while, to my friend's complete embarrassment - but he was not as embarrassed as when I started walking slowly hunched forward because my tummy was just stretching towards the ground.  GREAT value. GREAT food - it tastes delicious even the next day =] Not so great decor but THANK goodness for the air conditioner in the back (it's actually kinda cold back there)."}
{"text":"One of the most consistently priced and yummy places I've been to since moving to Toronto. The portions are generous and the service is friendly. I always get a spring roll and the gluten items are really tasty. I don't recommend the mapo tofu, it's not very spicy or authentic. The buddhas delight is always a favourite though."}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong Style Buddhist Vegetarian restaurant.  Buddhist vegetarian is more than just \"vegetarian\".  This is not a Seattle hippie cafe, and it is not Gordon Ramsay cooks greens.  It is superlatively cooked, simple, austere cuisine.  Every vegetable is tender but sings with flavor.  Saucing is minimal.  The menu is small and when you allow for the similar vegetable bases that go into most of the dishes - it is in fact smaller still.  (Vegetables. Vegetables in soup. Vegetables on Noodles. More Mushrooms in your vegetable mix. Vegetarian chicken and your vegetables. Vegetarian fish and your vegetables etc.)  But the vegetables speak for themselves and don't need much saucing.  Celery is powerful. Cashews taste overwhelmingly of cashew. White mushrooms give an honest accounting of themselves without having to use the old mediterranean trick of sauteeing them in olive oil onions and garlic until they taste like olive oil onions and garlic and not like mushroom.  Seaweed soup is one of the seaweediest things you will ever eat. (This aint nori paper for your sushi. This is a drink of the China Sea.)  Two non food notes.  One. The decoration is minimal. This is a hole in the wall - albeit one with healthy food.  Two - The owner is a deeply deeply committed Buddhist filled with the wisdom that comes from a life of dedicated self purification.  He is gregarious, friendly and has tales to tell.  His conversation will cure you of even more karmic illnesses than the food will.  If you need to detox from your sordid evil life, this is a great place to do so.  The food will purify your body.  The owner will purify your mind."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Buddha's Vegetarian Foods for more than 10 times. I am a meat lover but all the soy products taste even better than any meat! Absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"Prepare to eat. Prepare to eat LOTS. I went with my former coworker and his friend on my last day of work, and BOY - we were SO FULL. Food came really quickly for us. We had the following:  1) HOT & SOUR SOUP (medium): absolutely delicious - and definitely bigger than a medium than we expected. 2) VEGETARIAN FRIED VERMICELLI SINGAPORE STYLE: Absolutely delicious -- huge dish as well. 3) THREE KINDS MUSHROOM W/ GREEN VEGETABLES: It was okay - I think there would've been better choices.  I can definitely tell you - this place makes a LOT of food. Like, a LOT. We were there for about 4 hours to finish everything (you know, eat, digest, eat, digest). However, if you don't plan to overstay - I would really suggest to just order one less plate than you usually would."}
{"text":"This is the best if not the most aesthetically appealing Chinese vegetarian place in downtown toronto.  Personally, I hope they don't get a restaurant makeover attack, it just wouldn't be them and it's totally true about the servings and the prices....I don't know how these guys make money cause their cashew vegetable stirfry is chock full o' the cashews.  Personal fav is their giant soya rolls and singapore style curried noodles.  You can request that everything be made without msg. Closed tuesdays."}
{"text":"I went with two friends to this place for lunch and like fools, we ordered a big bowl of soup and three main dishes. When the food started coming, it was as if it were a joke...it was literally PILED on each plate. My one friend actually grunted while trying to pick up and move one of the dishes from one side of the table to the other.  Crazier still was the food was pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of the soup because it had big hunks of slippery tofu in it (and wet tofu just makes me gag), but the rest of the meals were good (a sort of curry noodle dish and two veggie stir-fry dishes).   The place inside looked (and looked even from the outside) like a total dive, and really? It is. But still, if you want good value for LOADS of food, this place ain't half bad."}
{"text":"Great little inexpensive spot for tasty Chinese vegetarian food.  I haven't dined in here but did phone in with a fairly large takeout order. The waiter was very helpful and courteous. The food was prepared on time and was ready for me when I arrived, packaged and ready to go. Surprisingly they use plastic containers for some of the dishes, not just the cheap styrofoam boxes (I think they use the plastic containers only for the dishes that are prone to having some sauce spilling).  Here are a few noteworthy items I tried: -Veggie fishes on iron plate - Basically deep fried bean curd-like stuff with some soy weed to give it a fishy taste, topped with some sauce/gravy of some sort. I've had something similar before at other veggie restaurants and this was pretty good. - General Tao's chicken - standard breaded and deep fried soy chunk with a General Tao sauce; yummy; probably the highlight of the meal for those unfamiliar with vegetarian food - Stir fried green beans with soya chops - some of my friends really enjoyed this - Mock beef w/ bean sprouts and stir fried rice noodle - meant to be a take on a popular Cantonese dish; the noodles were done decently but I've always found the mock beef to be lacking in terms of its texture and flavour  Servings were very generous and the price was terrific value.  It's not the best Chinese vegetarian restaurant around (there are better options in Markham or even close by at Kensington market - if you want more unique experiences go there instead), but the value is excellent here. It's simple, nofrills stuff, but tasty and hits the spot."}
{"text":"Huge portions and cheap. I wouldn't call it authentic asian food and it's not that flavourful but it's tasty enough...."}
{"text":"May just be the best Buddhist food place in Toronto. The end."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here after all the great reviews here last night. Well, actually ordered takeout but I will throw in my 2 cents.  What we ordered:  1) Singapore Noodles (curry style) 2) 3 Mushroom Chow Mein 3) Spring Rolls 4) Taro Roll 5) Small order of Imitation Duck (Bean Curd)  Thoughts on each of the dishes:  1) Least favourite of all. Didn't really like the flavour this dish had whatsoever. Will not order again. 2) Much better than the 1st dish. Noodles had some crispyness to them which I loved though many took on sauciness due to the car ride most likely. Mushrooms are plentiful and while I'm usually not a fan of some of the bigger chinese mushrooms found in these dishes, I didn't mind the ones in this one. I felt the dish lacked a little in flavour though but would still order again. 3) I'm a fan... I liked the spring rolls. Rolls are massive in size! 4) Not something I've ever ordered before, but I liked them! Rolls are gigantic in size also and very filling. Have a nice sweet flavour to them and I could almost eat them as a dessert. 5) I really liked this and didn't think I would going into it. The bean curd has a cool texture similar to duck. Will order again.  Total Price: $25!!! This place is CHEAP!!! The amount of food we have will easily last my girlfriend and I 4 meals. Each dish is a lot of food.  It is nowhere near the best chinese food I've ever had, but decent quality for a ridiculously good price.  Here are some pics of my food https://vine.co/v/bvDgWTrZHYJ"}
{"text":"It is what it is. Focus is on big portions and hand made vegetarian products.no glitz or glamour, just cheap and very tasty food"}
{"text":"The best about this restaurant is that they have HUGE portion dishes with that kind of price tags. However, the restaurant is a bit run down, and they have this weird seating. One table at this corner and 2 tables at that corners and some tables at the back of the corners.  The tasted weren't bad but also weren't that good that will give you a \"WOW\". I tried better ones. However, the prices were also a little bit higher of course. So...for the sizes and price, I would just give them 3 stars...  If I ever come back to this restaurant again. I don't think I will order their general tao chicken because each piece is just a blow up chicken ball. There is this 1/2 inch flour breaded the \"special flour\" inside. The general tao chicken sauce weren't bad. It is sweet and sour and have this \"punch\" to the taste that bring out the flavor, as a vegetarian dish, I would say their sauce is quite good, consider there is no ginger and garlic in all their dishes."}
{"text":"When meat lovers like me hear the word \"vegetarian\" our face cringes. Surprisingly, vegetarian food can be pretty good.  The restaurant is VERY small and quite hot in the back. We came in a group of 7 and were directed to a hidden part of their restaurant where we had to walk past dirty dishes =S.  The food was pretty good and the portions were large enough that we had to take a dish home. However, I thought everything was a bit on the greasy and oily side. We ended off dinner with spring rolls (I know it's the other way around). The spring rolls were super hot so you know they just came out of the fryer. The rolls came with a sweet and sour sauce which complemented it.  Overall, the food is great here but the decor and size of the restaurant lowers my rating."}
{"text":"Was promised the best vegetarian in the city and cheap. They were right about it being cheap.  Quantities are great if you can eat it. I, for one (and others at the table) could not. Maybe it was an off day in the kitchen or perhaps this is their style.   Will leave it to others to enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I quite enjoyed this restaurant! Came for dinner with friends and we ordered a few items to share between the four of us.   My favourite item was the mock duck noodle soup. It had a wonderful broth that was full of flavour but wasn't heavy or overly salted. The \"duck\" soy sheets were tasty and had good texture. If you're really craving something meaty, the \"chicken\" balls came surprisingly close. Crunchy batter on the outside and a well-seasoned filling really makes you feel like you're eating the real deal!  At $10 per person we even had two boxes of takeaway with their very generous portion sizes.   The decor and seating are not at all fancy but that is expected. With quick service, friendly staff and superb prices this place has great value. I would definitely consider returning when I'm looking for a lighter vegetarian meal!"}
{"text":"A decent place to come if you're looking to feed a hungry hoard fast, this bare bones diner is known for serving monstrously large portions.  The food itself is satisfactory and the menu selection consists of the usual Chinese fare, but there are better options to be had out east in Scarborough or in the surrounding neighbourhoods.  Newbies to Chinese cuisine may enjoy the food, but don't bother if you've got a choosy palate.   If you're scratching your head over lunch for Monday, bring a food container here on Sunday night; chances are you will need to take-out. As a bonus, Toronto Vegetarian Association cardholds get 10% off."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Buddha's for years. Absolutely love the food. We go every week. Its cheap, tasty and plentiful. The decor is minimal and uninspiring, but we come for the food and the friendly servers."}
{"text":"When I first discovered Buddha's 5 or 6 years ago it quickly became one of my favourite lunch spots. Massive portions of totally vegetarian Chinese food for dirt cheap. Absolutely no effort put in to decor or atmosphere - a plus for me. And, conveniently located at Bathurst and Dundas. What more could you ask for?  There was a time while I was at U of T that I'd come to Buddha's a couple times a week with a bunch of friends. We'd usually go for hot and sour soup, vermicelli Singapore-style, and one of the chow mein dishes with tofu and heaps of 'shrooms. There's no cheaper way for a vegetarian to stuff themselves to the gills.  Unfortunately, the novelty of the massive portions eventually wore off and I started question the quality of the food. The truth is, most of the dishes at Buddha's are very bland, boring, and taste almost exactly the same as each other.  If you're a vegetarian Buddha's is worth checking out at least once. If you're a meat eater don't bother; you'll find much better options on Spadina, such as Kom Jug Yuen (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/kom-jug-yuen-restaurant-toronto). If you do decide to eat here, don't do it too often because you'll get sick of the bland food very quickly"}
{"text":"Let me be clear - I'm a fan purely because of the value this establishment offers. The one elderly lady that works there always smiles and greets me like I'm a relative (shame she doesn't give me a relative discount though!).   The food is greasy, yes it is. The large is damn large, so go for the small, unless you're sharing (which is recommended).   This is not the place to go for ambience/vibe. What you see is what you get - cheap, greasy, veggie Chinese food. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. I love going here with a group of friends and sharing a few dishes.   I dig the hot'n'spicy soup."}
{"text":"As a non-vegetarian i was pretty disappointed.  The general tao imitation chicken had no flavour to it (i had a piece that didn't have much sauce on it and tasted like nothing), but luckily the dish was drenched in a sauce that wasn't too bad. The shanghai noodles tasted exactly how you would expect them to (nothing special). I really liked their tofu and the soup we ordered was very tasty and packed with stuff (can't remember what it was though).   I just couldn't get over how greasy and coated in oil everything was.  Definitely NOT a healthy choice, even though it's vegetarian.  Decor was pretty cheap and rundown looking.  The place was dirty looking, but the tables/dishes were clean (thankfully).  The upside is that it's dirt cheap and large portions.  So if you're a strictly vegetarian  looking for something greasy, you can't go wrong. But if you eat meat or want something healthy, i'd definitely give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Hearty portions, vegan fake meats galore.  Asian food that is quite alright."}
{"text":"A true vegan hot spot and a place where materialistic values are beaten by great taste, portion and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Cash only. Tiny spot. Don't eat THERE.  Great noodles but it's really all about the FAKE PEKING DUCK.  No, but then it's really all about the noodles.  This is how much I love the noodles. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaefYQ2M87k  Yes I have a noodle fetish."}
{"text":"The cooks are geniuses. Almost everything (if not everything) is vegan. Very unpretentious place. Small, not fancy or pretty, but clean. It is wonderful food, and lots of it for cheap.   One of the best in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Let's debunk the notion of vegetarian food is healthier than its alternative today. Chinese vegetarian dishes are fried and soaked in oil. It not only acts as a preservation agent, but also as marinates.   Overall, it was a pleasant experience..but it was mostly because of the company! I really enjoyed our conversations. Some of the English translations on the menu was hilarious. I have a hard time envisioning a Caucasian ordering \"black moss\" or \"bamboo fungus\".    Hot and Sour Soup ($8.90) The hot and sour soup is one of those things that was bastardized by the Western culture. It originated from Szechuan, China. Traditionally, it contains bamboo, mushroom, shredded pork, egg, wood-ear mushroom, blood pudding, tofu, black vinegar, white pepper and chili. This was a \"tamed\" version flavored by condiments. It wasn't particularly good or bad. Just little nutritional value.  Spring Roll ($1.30) The spring roll was a little overprice in comparison to uptown standards. I actually felt my mom's spring rolls triumph over Buddha's Vegetarian Restaurant's. It was very greasy! If you are craving giant greasy fried torpedo-looking fried food, then this is for you! I have been avoiding fried things to avoid further weight gain! My brother said I had the look of death when the spring roll was staring at me in the eye! In reality, I was hoping to break my fried-food fast with superior fried-things! Haha!  The food at Buddha's Vegetarian Restaurant was not extraordinary. It felt like a homemade meal. I was surprised by the exceedingly number of positive reviews online. Perhaps it was because we didn't try some of Buddha's Vegetarian Restaurant more famous dishes. Overall, I felt it was a relatively economic meal with ordinary unhealthy food. Now we know where Buddha got his belly :)"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant: family owned (always the same people working), delicious, fast service and extremely cheap!  This is one of those hole-in-the-wall gems in Toronto that you must try especially if you're vegetarian and loves Chinese food. They have a variety of dishes ranging from hot and sour soup to curry marinated \"chicken\" to mock \"duck\". I would highly recommend getting the chicken in iron plate. It's one of the most flavourful mock meat I've ever had!  Not to mention their portion is huge!! They also have some mock meat in a freezer that you could buy to take home as well."}
{"text":"Food quality is 4/5; service was super friendly and accommodating so that deserves an extra star.  This is a vegetarian chinese restaurant. I am not a vegetarian but like to come here once in a while for a change.   This restaurant has been around for many many years. I used to be a regular customer there when we lived in the area. We moved so we don't get to eat here as frequently as I would like. The quality of food remains good after so many years.  The restaurant looks dodgy, but food is good and portions are large; great value. Dinner for a group of 6 people cost us $50 with apps and entrees.  Appetizers: - immitation duck: my all time favorite, delish - spring rolls: my least favorite , too much cabbage. I would prefer soya rolls - taro rolls: if you like taro (a type of yam), you will like this. Very rich and filling. - soya rolls: yummy with bamboo shoots and chinese mushroom. I would recommend it   Entrees, we tried: - Buddha mixed vegetables fried noodles: chow mein was crispy. One of my fav - general tao chicken: I'm not a big fan, too doughy but my friends loved it - mock beef with tofu BBQ sauce: delish, highly recommend it. The tofu was so flavourful  - stir fried green beans with soy: good flavour, I liked the beans   Overall, good reliable vegetarian chinese food with large portions at very reasonable price. If you're looking for a fancy sit down place, this is not the place for you. The manager (or owner?) was super nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Great food. Very simple vegetarian dishes. It's a small family owned restaurant which seats no more than 20 people. From a hygienic perspective, it definitely fails -- but in theory, when cooking, the high heat annihilates any lingering bacteria to keep your food finger licking good. The prices here are ridiculously cheap, and the portions are equally ridiculously huge. It's very easy to order too much here. I was a lifeguard across the street street (At Alexandra Park) for about 3 years and we grabbed take out at least once a week."}
{"text":"Very good food Perfect for Vegans, wide menu with a LOT of options HUGE portions Very Cheap!!  It's also very authentic.  Food 10/10 Price 10/10  I love it"}
