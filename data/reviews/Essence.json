{"text":"The service was very good.  Restaurant decor was pleasant.   I ordered the lobster bisque.  It was terrible.  Earthy and strong in flavor like a crawfish bisque.   The waiter said they put sweet potatoes in in it. WHAT the blank.  On to the salmon, it was good but tiny in portion  along with the glass of wine. So if you want small portions with a sizable price tag go to essence.   With some Many options in Montreal I recommend move on."}
{"text":"The fries are SO GOOD! I often get the bavette or veal liver, always perfectly cooked. They have a lobster dish in the summer that is great too!"}
{"text":"GREAT! Food is always good, efficient service. The terasse in the summer is awsome, the best in the area."}
{"text":"I've tried Essence! J'ai vraiment essaye!!!   Twice I've been for lunch and twice I've been disappointed. And it isn't cheap either!  Today I had the pizza with prosciutto and arugula. I think that is one of the most basic pizzas you can make. It's just a plain cheese pizza with meat and raw salad on top.  Now the issues, where do I begin???  1) there was zero sauce on my pizza... Ok, maybe a slight exaggeration but pretty close. There was enough cheese for the personal pizza but it was so dry 2) they burnt part of the crust. It could have come out a bit earlier because it absolutely cut up the top of my mouth!!  My lunch date had the brevette of beef... It wasn't a great cut of meat. There were chewy parts and he had it medium rare... The fries that came with it seemed good and he enjoyed the started caesar since it was part of the host table.  Some positives?  Great outdoor section, roomy and for lunch, in the shade. Loved their hot oil. Wasn't crazy hot but packed a sweet punch."}
{"text":"We had breakfast with some colleagues during a conference and the service was nice and the food options for the buffet satisfying. I was disappointed by my vegetarian omelet made on the bar, which was very very oily, but other things stuff I ate; fruits and croissants were nice. The staff was very understanding because the friends we were meeting overslept and took a while to get down. They are chatty but not too intrusive. The prices are high as they tend to be with such hotel restaurants. The buffet is 27 dollars, and a nice option because it includes coffee and juice which are otherwise 5 bucks each. Regular dishes are around 18 bucks."}
{"text":"I went there twice for lunches on Fridays, because it's near my job and one of my coworkers loves it since \"it has a bit of everything\" (that's what she says).  The place has a lunch menu, with a table d'hôte which includes either the soup du jour or a juice, main course and coffee.   I'm not a fan of terraces, but for those who do, note that they have a giant terrace.   First time, I had the salmon tartar and the salad. When I got it, I noticed a short black curly hair on it (I'm straight-haired blonde). It didn't bother me too much so I just took it out. Good portion; not too big, not too small. Lots of onions and fresh herbs, and yet you could still taste the raw salmon (great!). Salad was also very good. Price: $22.   The second time, I ordered the cheeseburger, or the \"hambourgeois avec fromage et bacon\", since our waiter didn't understand when I said \"cheeseburger\". The burger is really big and has BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (a nice surprise). Also, it was not a McDonald's patty, i.e. frozen and then heated. I couldn't finish it all. The fries came in a mini fryer basket, which was cute. On that note, the food is always nicely presented on the plates. Price: $14.   Fans of fish: my coworker only swears by their pan-seared salmon.   When I go back, because I know I will, I'll try the beef tartar."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. $15 to get in (Labor Day weekend). I didn't get man-handled from security, so that's always good.  The DJ played the usual music you hear on urban radio, and Kompa (Haitian music), which I didn't expect. Nice little spot. And, the drinks weren't watered down."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour peut-être la cinquième fois ce midi. C'est le genre de restaurant qui ne cuisine rien qui sort de la norme, donc il est peu mémorable. Mais tout est toujours bon. Aujourd'hui, j'ai mangé le tartare de saumons. Ils le servent habituellement avec des pommes, mais comme j'y suis allergique, je l'ai pris sans (j'avais vraiment envie du tartare de saumon). C'est my bad. Malgré tout, il était très bon (très simple, mais bon... il aurait d'ailleurs été simple aussi avec les pommes), mais il manquait de sel. Ce n'était pas hyper dramatique, puisqu'ils mettent des salières sur la table, mais il manquait BEAUCOUP de sel. Bref, c'est un très sympathique restaurant pour les dîners entre collègues. Tout est bien fait, mais rien n'est jamais incroyable. Mais je ne ferais pas le détour."}
{"text":"Excellent staff, food and ambience. Went for Sunday brunch. The high quality of the eggs, fruits, waffles was tasted in every bite. Fantastic pricing for the amount and quality. We will be back."}
{"text":"Typiquement un restaurant d'affaire.  Le lieu est grand et assez bien insonorisé pour s'entendre même si le restaurant fait salle comble.   Mention spéciale au décor très sobre et épuré.  La table d'hôte coûte environ 25-30$ en fonction du plats.  Le menu contient des pizzas, burger, salades, tartares (buf/saumon), ... .  J'ai pris le magret de canard - sauce poivre. Le magret était bien cuit accompagné de légumes et de pommes de terres.  Le service était correct et efficace.  Le restaurant manque d'originalité dans son menu pour donner envie de venir en fin de semaine ou le soir, mais cela reste un lieu parfait pour les déjeuners d'affaires grâce son rapport qualité/prix."}
{"text":"Stumbled in to this place for a casual late supper with my wife and had a wonderful experience. Friendly and efficient staff and a great meal. Will definitely return.  Try the salmon burger--the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Wonderful salmon and fresh fruit on the bar. I had the most amazing orange juice here. Maybe I was hungry or something but it was fresh squeezed and ice cold...   I had the buffet breakfast. Plenty of choices and breakfast standards. Bacon was perfect but when is bacon not perfect. Omelet prepared to order with a wide range of options.   Good joint but very spendy. I would give it 5 stars but the price was too high."}
{"text":"This is the in-house restaurant at the Westin Calgary (downtown).  It serves breakfast and lunch, although I've only ever gone for their breakfast buffet, which was included complimentary as part of my hotel booking.  The breakfast buffet here is not the best I've ever had at a hotel, but it's still pretty decent.  They have your typical fare (bagels, pastries, sausage, eggs, oatmeal, fresh fruit, French toast, pancakes) and even an omelette station.  Although the selection isn't huge compared to some other hotel buffets I've been to, the quality is fairly good (again, considering the fact it's a hotel buffet).  The things I liked in particular:  - Smoked salmon/lox... and they have bagels/cream cheese/onions if you want to make a lox bagel sandwich (always a breakfast classic!)  - Oatmeal station (they have a bunch of toppings you can add to your oats to make it as fancy as you like - pistachios, pumpkin seeds, raisins, cranberries, honey, cereal, granola, etc...)  - Sautéed vegetables which are decently seasoned and tasty (yes, I'm weird and like to eat veggies in the morning... sometimes)  - Scrambled eggs, which taste REALLY decadent.  Like, I can definitely taste the butter and cream in them, so they're not healthy, but they're quite tasty for buffet-grade eggs that have been sitting in a heating tray  They're also pretty good about providing you a takeout box, containers, and a little bag if you want to get your food to go (e.g. for work meetings).  OVERALL: 3/5.  I mean, it's a hotel buffet, so you know what you're getting into, but the food is pretty decent and it's a convenient option if you're staying at the Westin."}
