{"text":"I visited this place within the first week of opening by suggestion of my dining partner. I was surprised at the address, because I couldn't recall there being a restaurant. It's a little out of the way, being east of Palmerston. It turns out that Hi! There used to be a bar, so it doesn't ring in our mind's eye as a food location.

Unfortunately for Hi! There, there was nothing specifically notable about the place, except that the rice was under cooked. They have decent prices, especially at lunch time, but there are a dozen other places down the street doing exactly the same thing. I have no idea how they're going to compete.

Best of luck to them."}
{"text":"This place looked mysterious and pretty sketchy from the outside because the windows are covered handmade posters, but I trusted Yelp and I am glad I did.

It is a cozy, intimate place with around 8 tables. The food was delicious without being too sweet, which would explain why the majority of their clientele was Korean. It was pretty full on a Thursday night. There was a couple on a quick dinner date, a married couple enjoying Korean BBQ with some soju, friends drinking their butts off, etc. Super casual, but with a comfortable noise level, and anyone can blend in.

Their menu is as extensive as the other places, so something for everyone.

Server was nice, price is average for the area, and the food was above average. I would go back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is Koreatown's new best kept secret. They have a pretty comprehensive and standard menu that are good and comparable to others at least and, depending on what you order, could be a lot more tastier than rest of Koreatown (e.g. light beef and bone soup). 
Their specialty of spicy pig intestines on a grill (~$30) is off this world yummy! I didn't find it on the menu but on the wall with a Korean caption so I have no idea what its called in English but I posted a picture so you can show the server. This single dish will have me going back and back again!"}
{"text":"Very flavourful and authentic! We just happened upon this tiny little shop and were pleasantly surprised by all aspects of the dinning experience. The food was fresh, very reasonably priced, and the service was sublime. I would have really liked to try some Korean beer (they were out) but was happy with the selection they offered in place. We tired the Pork bone soup, chicken bi bim bap, fried dumplings, and egg/ham pancake. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Down right, home-cooked food, as if your Korean mother cooked it for you.  I visited from Seattle to check out Korean town and ran into this place on a empty stomach. I think the food was a bit underpriced, and the plethora of flavors was beyond expected.  Service was great and friendly.  Very limited seating, so arrive early if you want to ensure best availability.  Highly recommend checking out some of their stews... the 2 we had were great."}
{"text":"This place was alright, nothing super special, and one of the few Korean places in Koreatown I've been that did not taste super-authentic. This seemed to me a place where men go later in the evening to have (many) drinks and fried chicken.  I would give this place 2.5 stars- the service was fine, it was clean enough, and food came quickly enough. Perhaps it was an off-type of day? The food was not bad, but was just alright- it's the lack of authentic Korean flavour that left me wanting. Edit: perhaps it was made toned-down for the Canadian/North American palate? More recently, I make it a point to make sure the server understands that I want it authentic and spicy :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. One of the more quieter low key restaurants on Christie which I like. Great place for dates. I usually come for their awesome potato pancakes and s bottle of soju. Food is very affordable. Their bbq is quite popular. The only downside is their juices haven't been in stock for a while."}
{"text":"Best place to have my favorite Korean alcohol. (Makeolli: rice wine) Its a small cozy place and great side dishes. A gem in the mist of Korean restaurants and gives a feel of being in Korea. 4 stars because if you have to sit next to the door in winter, prepare to feel an ice cold breeze every so often."}
{"text":"Great side dishes. Pancakes are great. I can't stop ordering #70. Simple, unassuming great food. Youtube channel playing k-pop on a loop. Hidden little spot. Don't tell your friends!"}
{"text":"very small place but cozy.  Becuase the place is hard to he found on the street, they are like a gem on the Bloor street. Severs are very friendly. Their food are good for the price. My favourite there is Kalguksu and spicy pork. love Hi There."}
