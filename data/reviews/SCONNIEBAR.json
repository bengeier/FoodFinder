{"text":"Gave Sconnie Bar another chance. It was awesome. It was after a women's bb game on a Sunday night, and we were pleasantly surprised to see half price burgers! We each had the smoked brat soup and the curd burger. We were really impressed by each. I think that may have been one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Had a couple tap Bud Lights, and I was pretty happy."}
{"text":"Great service! Was there on a Saturday evening and was served quickly. Food was tasty! I got their northern pike fish sandwich which was fresh and delicious! The rest of the menu looked good; a huge step up from your average bar food. I will have to go there again!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a bite to eat on he way to Uw Hospital. Good friendly service. Cheese curds are awesome but being from Wisconsin I think our blood is cheese curds. Sconniebburger was great.  Would recommend stopping by for a drink and a burger."}
{"text":"A fun sports bar with legitimately good food and an awesome beer selection -- I'm already a big fan of this place!  Of course there are a ton of TVs and it's a fun place to catch a game, but Sconniebar goes beyond that.  With super friendly service and delicious homemade mac and cheese, Sconniebar lives up to its goal of celebrating the best parts of Wisconsin.  It exceeded my expectations and will definitely be a go-to place for me whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food, great drink specials, and amazing staff SCONNIEBAR is definitely the place to go. The menu caters to everybody's likings and who doesn't love a great grilled cheese and tomato soup? It gets even better with $1 grilled cheeses on Thursday nights. SCONNIEBAR is a great Wisconsin themed bar and an amazing addition to Regent St!"}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in to the SconnieBar this past weekend and experienced quite possibly the worst service we've ever had in Madison. The experience started off okay, but got progressively worse. The wait staff was friendly, but they were understaffed, terribly undertrained, and there was no manager attempting to take care of this debacle. We had two kids at our table and we were never brought kids menus...which wasn't a big deal. It took about 15-20 minutes to get our drinks and we had to go to the bar to get refills.  I counted five tables that walked while we were there. We found ourselves asking wait staff to help other tables, because we felt bad for some of the families waiting to eat. One person got the wrong meal and they forgot to bring chips for one of the other meals. We asked for the chips three times and and when they were finally brought out, the person was done eating. They took the chips off the bill, but they screwed up the bill, attempting to charge some of us twice the cost of our meals. They fixed the bill and then I noticed they were still overcharging for one of the kid's dinners. I decided to just overpay since we had been there long enough and I didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes for them to fix the bill yet again. I hate giving bad reviews, but they had no right being open. I hope they can get it together or they simply won't last."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good burger. Get the chips instead of the fries. Cheese curds were outstanding."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and had a grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato soup, it was great and I am looking forward to coming back to try other things on the menu. We had a very large group and they handle it with ease.

The menu prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"After the OSU/Wisc football game this past weekend we stopped in to have a celebratory drink. With that being said, we were OSU fans and the service we received was down right comical. Upon ordering our first round of drinks, we were told it was cash only. We were inside at the bar and they had an ATM so no big deal. That's until we started seeing people sign their CC bills. While ordering the second round we inquired why some people were paying with their CC if it was cash only. We were told that the system was down. Also, no big deal, it happens. When the service got comical was when we ordered our third round. The guy to our right was signing his CC bill, we ordered and were told cash only, and the guy to our left ordered and handed the bartender their CC. At this point we confronted the bartender who told us that there were plenty other bars on campus and we could take our business elsewhere. At this point we could not believe that a bar on campus would really not want our business because we were in scarlet instead of red. The Wisconsin fans were wonderful and bought us another round on their CC that they had been using the entire time we were there. Moral of the story is that they are not welcoming to away fans. Go to other tailgating spots like Lucky's or Jorden's Big Ten if you are visiting!"}
{"text":"WORST. SERVICE. EVER! 3 tables walked out in our 1.5 hours we were there. The food had taste potential, however, when you are parched from lack of beverages and what you ordered either didn't come out complete, at all or was wrong, it really doesn't matter. 

If you weren't ready to be open on a Friday night, UW Women's Volleyball night, then you should have waited another week or two. Train your staff, hire more employees and get your act together. You have potential, but you REALLY blew it tonight - big time! 

Total disappointment."}
{"text":"STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ORDER FROM SCONNIEBAR. 
Seriously. lol The Salmon Sandwich I had was no ordinary sandwich- it was a gift from the heavens, y'all. I forgave the slightly *too* well done sweet potato fries because they cooked that filet to perfection. Not a single flavor was out of place! 

My co-worker, who ordered the Curd Burger, also had nothing but positive things to say about it. Most notably, their presentation was impeccable. I assumed things would be slapped together (since they seemed at first glance to be just another sports bar), yet it seems they aim to impress in all aspects! And boy do they succeed"}
{"text":"Came here on opening day (which happened to be the day of the UW/LSU game).  Understandably the place was packed and the waitstaff was swamped.  After a few minutes, we were able to flag down a manager and they promptly sent a server to the table.  Even as busy as it was, I can tell the kitchen is definitely upgraded from it's predecessor, Lucky.  The menu has been refreshed and now includes several options of grilled cheese sandwiches.  Always a fan of something that will give me a heart attack, I opted for the burger topped with a brat.  The burger was cooked to order (medium rare) and topped with havarti and bacon, the sandwich was a hearty offering.  I will be looking forward to coming on a non game day in a few weeks and try out other options."}
{"text":"Great drink specials. Reasonably priced. Friendly and attentive staff. Accepting of alternative life styles/ orientation. Clean environment. Best gay bar on regent street."}
{"text":"This place is way bigger than it looks from the street. My boyfriend and I really liked the food here! We ordered the spicy cheese curds, they're amazing. We went at a pretty slow time, there were maybe 4 tables seated, and the service was a little slow. That being said, our waitress was very nice. We ordered a sandwich and a wrap. The buffalo wrap is very spicy! Has great flavor. The sandwich my boyfriend ordered was good he said. I'll be coming back for more of those spicy cheese curds, they're so good!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here during the last Badger game. Awesome service and solid bar fare. Great on game days, if you can find a spot. Always packed!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely evening at sconnie bar. There are so many tvs and a great tap selection. Service is pretty good"}
{"text":"I was organizing a after work group outing for dinner and a hockey game at the Kohl Center and Sconniebar came through for me in a great way. After contacting many venues in the area Sconniebar was the only venue that would take a reservation for my group of 12. They also run a shuttle from the bar to the Kohl Center which made it very easy for me to keep my group together. The service staff were friendly and helpful! I would definitely come back to this location and would recommend to anyone trying to set up this type of event!"}
