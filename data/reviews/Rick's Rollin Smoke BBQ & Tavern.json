{"text":"We had our 25th high school reunion here, this past weekend. If you are looking for a fun spot to hold your event, definitely consider Rick's! For a very reasonable price, they had a great buffet spread and more than enough food for everyone in our group.  The bar was a load of fun and the drink prices were very good! The free shots were a plus. We had a Halloween themed party at Rick's and we had a ball!  For the Pawn Star fans, Rick does bartender duty later in the evening and is a very generous host!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST!  Loved the smoked meat loaf and the mac and cheese. My friend LOVED the pork rinds, chicken and potato salad. Rick has definitely mastered the art of smoked BBQ. Wish there was one in California. By the way, the service in the Tavern was awesome too!"}
{"text":"My first post. But I had to post about this place! Best BBQ I've had!! Bar upstairs was awesome. Friendly staff, overly friendly!! Haha. I think the bartender was Matt but he was the best, great service, great food and we came back later that day because Matt said that Rick Harrison from pawn stars show was bartending. We got to talk to him and get a photo!! I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife had the ribs. There was great beer from local breweries which is always good to taste new things and they were happy enough to let me taste the beer before buying a whole pint! The bar is a bit small but very comfortable, and there is an outside patio overlooking the pawn shop. Overall 10/10!"}
{"text":"Just a shitty, bootleg version of Rolling Smoke....with a 30% surcharge for being next to a dismal pawn shop and having Rick's fleshy mug posted on the walls.  What a mistake to think it might be more..."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting -- NO CLUE why this place is rated so high.   Brisket was overcooked.  Ribs overcooked. Mac N Cheese... mediocre.  And all of the above came out cold. Didn't even try to heat it up a bit.  If you have the option, please PLEASE avoid this \"BBQ\" place. Waste of $50."}
{"text":"Best in town check them out the best BBQ I've ever had. Thanks for the amazing services. Food was delicious bar services is great. The BBQ ribs are to die for different sauces just yummy yummy overall."}
{"text":"The ribs at this place are to die for served with a side of Mac, you can't go wrong. Although the menu is somewhat limited, they are doing it right. The spicy sauce will put some hair on your chest, but is very flavorful at the same time."}
{"text":"Rick rocks with the best BBQ in Vegas!! Ribs are tender, meaty and juicy. Mac and cheese is smoked and full of cheese and flavor. Don't pass this place by. Guaranteed to full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Fun night of karaoke.  Food good...lady bartender could have smiled and been a little friendly. Great location."}
{"text":"We traveled all the way from Florida to visit the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. I have watched every episode since Pawn Stars came out. I've never had a favorite show until it.  We were pleasantly surprised when the doorman informed the crowd inside the Pawn Shop that Rick was making drinks at his bar. We headed over forgetting bars don't let in \"under 18-ers.\" (My son was with us). We were sent out of the bar, but Eddie brought us complimentary sodas and said Rick \"might\" come out for the kids.   AND HE DID!!! He took a photo with my son and then I snuck in one with them. Not sure if Rick approved of what I did but I'm sure he knows how the \"kids\" get to his shop;-)   In gratitude for the sodas and the photo-op, we ate downstairs at the BBQ place. Food was highly flavorful and scrumptious! I loved the souvenir cups, the stickers for my son's skateboard, and the mac-and-cheese!! What I loved the MOST, though, at the Pawn Shop and BBQ place was the staff. Every single one of them was outgoing, courteous, and friendly (especially Eddie!). Food prices were what I'd expect it to be: 2 meals with sides and drinks were $40 and don't forget the cup is yours to keep and refillable sodas.   Glad we went! Thank you Rick for the picture and thank you Eddie for the hospitality!! You made our trip and ya'll mean that much more to us now!!"}
{"text":"The brisket is to die for. We had a great time having drinks with Rick and Corey and the gang. Everyone was very friendly and it's just an overall great place to eat and have fun."}
{"text":"We originally planned on heading to the other Rollin Smoke place in Vegas, only it was shut as it was Sunday. Some staff happened to be there and sent us to Rick's and we are so glad they did. The food was tasty and the staff were great, helped us choose from the menu and were welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"We came for lunch time, the food doesn't worth the money, too expensive for locals; maybe they can trick tourist; but no locals.no coming again!. Service and location no bad"}
{"text":"Ridiculous.  I am a frequent visitor to the original Rollin Smoke. I happened to be in the area so I was happy when lunch time came around and there was Rick's Rollin Smoke.  I walked in, looked at the menu and saw that a combo of a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink is $20. I asked the man behind the counter if this was correct. He said it was. So I thanked him and left.  This is twice the cost as the original Rollin Smoke. Clearly, Rick's Rollin Smoke is aimed at the tourist trade."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! Told by two different people to go there for real bbq. Brisket was unreal. Loaded potato was huge definitely loaded. My wife called cornbread best she has tried in a long time. Next time I make it back to Vegas I'm stopping there again."}
{"text":"Great food, but even better atmosphere.  Rick Harrison guest bartending Friday and Saturday  and the tunes keep coming too. #bringingtheheat"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 4-stars, but the food was a bit underwhelming. The experience and service were great though! Our bartender/bar manager was super friendly; we had a good time getting to know him.   My partner and I were in Vegas for a weekend getaway and came across their 2nd floor bar after checking out the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. We went in for just a drink but decided to have a nibble and ordered the Duo Choice of 2 Meats (ribs and brisket) with one side (mac & cheese). The ribs were good, the brisket was a bit dry and the mac & cheese was fine. The food just wasn't hot and fresh.   I think this place has potential though! The second floor is a nice space to hangout for locals and visitors (have a bevvie and yummy bbq). If they improved on the food, it can go a long way!"}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue in Las Vegas no doubt. But make sure you come to this one because the other rolling smoke has dry barbecue. This one the meat is juicy and smokey and the staff that work there are nice. I would also say that this one is more sanitary than the other one."}
{"text":"Kelli is amazing. She is an amazing bartender and showed us the best time we could have ever had. We were so lucky to find this place - truly a hidden gem in Vegas! All because of Kelli, she is the best bartender I've ever met."}
{"text":"Tasty ribs in meh belly.  Pulled piggly pork was mighty testy.  The chopped brisket he'd me feeling zesty. Bout to go home and take a nap in my nesty"}
{"text":"Good food... The other location is better. We were here for dinner and the waiter sent the bouncer with the check and he said \"I need you guys to pay for this food right now\" not sure where that came from. We were dressed nice and didn't look like we were gonna skip on the check. Very rude would not return here again"}
{"text":"Vegetarian before I walked in.... Burnt brisket ends took me back! I couldn't say no! Delicious savory Bbq!!"}
{"text":"This bar I am very pleased to have the good food and drink. Once I've met Rick Harrison here. I can not complain it's one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. I advise everyone to visit this place and you will not regret."}
{"text":"This is a great joint for beer and BBQ. I like the fact that spicy means spicy and it definitely does here.  I had the burnt ends and the hot links and both were top notch. The bartender is awesome and the bar is just right. Excellent BBQ and great beer selection.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Damn that was a good meatloaf !  A touch pricey but it was that good .  I'll be back to try other things for sure ."}
{"text":"Solid spot for people looking for bbq in downtown Las Vegas.  Meat was tender, and all the sides were flavorful.  You can also buy beer in cans, or hit the bar upstairs for draft I believe.  Cornbread was on point and portions are legit.  Iv been here a few times and will come back.  Service is good and staff friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a local and it was the best BBQ I've had. We had the brisket nachos, burnt end sliders and the skillet...everything Yummy! Craft beers were great. Gotta try the mystery shot. Prices are very reasonable. Locals get a great discount. Hands down the best service ever!!! So much that we started with lunch @ noon and ended up closing the bar. Matt and Mark were amazing bar tenders. The whole staff was great...welcoming, informative and provided the best service! Made us feel like we were part of Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ family. Looking forward to going back real soon and letting everyone know about this awesome place! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with coworkers for a late lunch on a Thursday. I ordered the brisket stuffed yam. Easily in my Top 10 meals of all time. Maybe top 5. Michael Dunn was helping our table out and I told him if that was my last meal ever I'd be totally happy. It was fantastic! I also tried the cornbread someone ordered because they insisted (I'm not much for cornbread) and it was great, too! Next time I'm in Las Vegas I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm sure  the food is good but the on-line menu is a clear bait and switch.  The prices are much higher at ricks than the original restaurant. However you won't know that till you get there.  The 2 meat and side is $20 with drink, at the original it's  $13.99 without the drink.  $7 drink.  Go to the original."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pulled chicken and Mac and cheese that I have tasted. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great tavern upstairs with Ally tending bar!  Great smells coming up from Ricks BBQ downstairs!"}
{"text":"Food was not as good as the original Rollin Smoke but still hit the spot. Parking was easy and location was convenient. Portions were good and the workers went above and beyond."}
{"text":"I had a little sampler with rib had good bite and texture, hot link was tasty and flavorful, and burn ends good also.  Different sauces to choose from and some the best I have had.  A good value and taste as well.  Easy parking for the area.  Ate upstairs in the bar, service was polite and friendly but slow and inattentive.   I will repeat the place for the food, for sure, actually some of the best bbq. in Vegas."}
{"text":"All around good BBQ here, in addition to the original Rolling Smoke, Rick's has the spirits! Good friendly service going the extra distance to make it special. I wasn't to impressed with the burnt ends everything else was deliciousWhen in Vegas you must try this place you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great location. And you know what they say!!! Location location location. Rolling smoke bbq is one of Vegas's best and a must eat. Combine that with an excellent bar and the location to watch what happens at the pawn stars pawn shop? Hello!!! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Place is extremely expensive for some bbq. Went on my lunch break for a quick meal. You'll spend around $12-$14 for a sandwich by itself. Want a soda? That'll be $5 more! They give away a souvenir cup with it, but theres no way to opt out and pay a normal price for a drink. Then on top of that, a side is also an additional fee. Basically, you'll spend $20-$25 for a simple lunch, just for yourself.  On the plus side though, Free parking (a rarity in this area) and food was definitely delicious. Could not afford to make this a regular lunch spot, however. Potato salad was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place to check out... Food is amazing, and service is even better!!! Our bartender Matt was great!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Anytime I am in Vegas, this is where I go for BBQ. The pulled pork and the brisket are absolutely amazing. It's not on the strip but it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Subpar that's the word I would use if asked to sum up this barbecue restaurant in one word. The prices are excessive even for barbecue though not insane. But given the product that they produce It is Well above what they should be charging. I have had better BBQ from Arby's then I got at this place for double the price. Their pulled pork was Bland and tasteless the brisket left a lot to be desired the hot link was okay but the outer casing was difficult to chew digestion swallow and the bread was hard not stale but clearly getting there. The meal itself was under sized and the drinks were outrageously overpriced and I don't mean the alcoholic drinks I mean every drink on the menu even water was overpriced. The venue in which it was served lacked any sense of aesthetic charm the chef was very stingy with the sauce and the person at the counter had no idea what they were doing. I don't know what I expected from this place given who owns it. But I can tell you one thing I will not be returning here and I strongly suggest everybody else do the same because it is not worth it like I said I have gotten better barbecue from Arby's and Applebee's at half the price or less. This place is in a sense one giant rip off."}
{"text":"The Best BBQ here in Vegas Baby whoooooooooooaaa. .!! Super great food and service. ..."}
{"text":"We were sooo happy to find that this place existed! We have been looking for a great smoked BBQ place here in Vegas and hadn't found any that really impressed us. This place is a hidden gem and we loved it! The meat is smoked very nicely, the sides are very good (love the potato salad) and the desserts are yummy (we loved the banana pudding). Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch if you are looking for someplace a little lower key than the strip. Good service, fair prices, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ribs platter $24.99 was recommended for 2 but really it was barely enough for one person. It came with 1 side + 2 each of St. Louis, baby back and beef ribs. Isn't bad, all of them fell off the bone, juicy, tender but was it lacked flavour big time. It had a bit of smoky taste but because there wasn't much seasoning, it was a big disappointment. There were some hot sauce to dip them in but I was looking for sticky bbq sauce slathered over them."}
{"text":"Great bbq and ice cold beer.  They are friendly and the price is right.  We had a bunch of friends visiting LV for some golf and gaming.  Rick's Rollin Smoke was very accommodating and even took individual orders for couples even though not asked.  The HH was great and PBR's were ice cold.  Hey stick with the ribs, add as much sauce as you like and drink lots of beer and hmmm, it's pretty damn good and the price is right.  We were going to the original Rollin Smoke BBQ but that place doesn't have beer so it made Rick's place an easy choice."}
{"text":"This was truly a celebrity spotting stop.  However, they really have great BBQ.  They can run a pawn shop and can make some awesome BBQ. Get the sweet potato with the burnt ends - you will not be disappointed.  They have a grapefruit cider  on the bar menu, also better than expected.  This is a great place to get some BBQ in Vegas with the added benefit, you can cross the parking lot and get a Rolex for $23K."}
{"text":"Great place-on the second floor and great views of your surroundings. Came here as part of a pub crawl and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Came all the way here for nothing!  They ran out of bbq an hour before they closed.  Seriously?   A bbq joint that ran out of BBQ to sell.  Why stay open and just stand around there with a stupid smile on your face?  Horrible.  Don't even bother coming here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time. Stopped in yesterday and omg it was well worth it the food was amazing and the Service and people there were too so friendly and happy to help. If you're ever in town to get a chance to stop bye do it."}
{"text":"BBQ the way it's supposed to be done! Just wish they had beef ribs more than 1 day a week :(  Great burnt ends and smoky mac and cheese...so happy that they are laying off the black pepper. It's on EVERYTHING so it can be overwhelming. I prefer their country girl Carolina mustard sauce but they have like 5 to choose from."}
{"text":"i absolutely LOVE this place, there ribs are out of this world!! There sides are also mouth watering, just writing this review I question when can i go back again??? LOL will recommend to all my clients, friends, and family!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first. This is the Rick pawn stars. However, I was pleasantly surprised! I had the burnt ends and it was good eats!!!! The restaurant itself only holds 35 people but there is seating outside. It's good BBQ!"}
{"text":"Ali was the best great food Best stop of the day for sure. Best bbq in town would highly recommend this stop"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come down and see what the place was like.  Very nice and very clean.  Great food.  We had the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich with sides of mac n cheese.  Very very tasty.  The cashier even asked if we were from here so we got the locals discount. I would definitely recommend and would also go more often."}
{"text":"So good!! Best service. Such cute bar. Best food in Vegas and music is poppin!! Must come every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The ribs are too expensive - almost $40 for a rack of small ribs which are not very meaty.  They taste OK, but not a good value.  I am from Texas, so maybe I am spoiled, but just based on the price, I can do better.  Their beer selection is great."}
{"text":"Awesome bartender, location, with free parking. A funky friendly little joint with amazing food!!"}
{"text":"If you come here on the weekends there is a good chance you can see Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars. But even if you don't get to see him, the food here is delicious! I went with the Pulled Chicken sandwich, very good!  Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Great quality of meat as well!   First time here and they were more than happy to explain to us how ordering your food here goes.  They have a variety of drinks from tea, juice,sodas, and beers. They have a great variety of their meats! Lots of different meals, sandwiches and side orders!  I ordered the dual plate for my other half and added ribs for myself. Best bang for your bucks!  Their atmosphere is clean and have lots of space.  Tv for entertainment.   I LOVE their smoked meats here!!!! Definitely eating my smoked meats from here no where else! I love the fact that their bar is upstairs and Resturant down stairs because when you're with your family or friends that have children they can join you down stairs. I recommend this bar and restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Want to taste delicious BBQ? If yes then, Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ and Tavern is the hotel in Las Vegas that is highly rated for its spicy and yummy taste, no one can deny for its foods. It is not just excellent with respect to its hot BBQ, but also for its Cocktail, rice, sauces, and sandwiches, it is being offered the romantic, clean, and tidy environment to its customers so that they feel great every inch.   Customer's service is also at its peak it offers very friendly abode and considered as the best place for tasty HALAL foods in Las Vegas as well."}
{"text":"Nice dinner with my wife and the bbq tacos are good. If you in downtown check out Ricks. Later on Ricks is behind the bar."}
{"text":"It was very just OK I ate here due to convenience of travel unfortunately the barbecue wasn't that good the sides surprisingly were pretty good but the barbecue sauce had a very distinct taste I had to take it home and reheat it and then put my own barbecue sauce on it tasted a lot better than it did when I first took a bite before leaving  the restaurant so maybe I just caught them on a bad day or because it was closing heat wasn't really a main focus but I'm sure I will give them another try until then I would give you a 2.5"}
{"text":"Great bbq and better service. Mark our server/bartender was terrific.  Highly recommend the BEEF RIB. It's a meal by itself.  Had it with the slaw and it really cut the richness of the beef. Definitely worthy a return trip!   * Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the funky seating. It's really bar not a restaurant."}
{"text":"I very rarely give anyplace 5 stars, this place deserves it!!!  Like some of the other reviewers, I have been to the original location, MANY times. I absolutely love the food. This location gets the 5 star rating not only for the food, but the staff as well. Kelli Lebsock was wonderful suggesting different types of beers and bringing samples to try. She is very knowledgeable  and has a great personality.....ok I'm tring to be politically correct here, she is very attractive too! (Any Jeri Ryan fans?, she could be her twin).  I believe the staff at this location as well as the food, make it a place to visit again and again!  Thank you all........ I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I give a lot of 5 stars because as long as the staff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and food is delicious then that's perfect in my book. This place had all 3. We were in the bar area upstairs and it's so cute the bartender was very nice and hospitable. For the smokers out here they also have a patio where you are free to light up."}
{"text":"Great comedy. Mac and cheese is probably the best I've ever had. BBQ is always top notch. Bar tender Ali is amazing."}
{"text":"We had the stuffed baked potato with brisket and it was very good. The 3 stars is for the prices in this place. $32 for a slab of ribs, with no sides....sides are $5 each. Rick showed up and a lady wanted a autograph, Rick was not in the mood. The food was Great!"}
{"text":"Places are pricy in Las Vegas and this place is no exception. But it should be considering its fast food.  Pros- food was hot and tastes good. Service was very friendly.   Cons- way over priced. For a party of four we paid $85 for four sandwiches and sides (extra) with drinks (non alcohol). The portions are decent but nothing more than you would get at a sandwich shop.   Other thoughts- Atmosphere was nothing spectacular you sit on plastic stools and most people that came were ordering to go. My suggestion is go to Ricks pawn shop across the parking lot, but skip his over priced restaurant."}
{"text":"Try the burnt ends. All the sauces are great.  Great service.  Try the open bar upstairs too."}
{"text":"Good bbq! The brisket was moist and very tender. They have a few sauces. Spicy is hot hot hot! Ghost pepper. Love it! Worth the walk."}
{"text":"If your in Las Vagas don't waste your time stopping at this Bar ..... Bar is about 600 square feet and cramped, music is load for the space, $16.00 for a Long IslandTea and a bottle of water .... Don't bother trying to get either a picture or autograph from Rick the star of Pawn Stars and owner even if you buy something .... He only takes pictures with you if you and I quote \"have a vagina\" Rick if your going to be in the public eye then be the same with all your Fans"}
{"text":"This place is awsome will come back again thanks rick for the new place the food was great and the beer was just what i needed great job. This is kyle one if your great fans love this place diffenlty will come back again great job on the detail.The price of every thing was very far and decent$$"}
{"text":"Ordered brisket sandwich which was amazing, received local 20% discount and staff were very friendly! In fact the staff make the atmosphere very fun!  Plus one of the guys there resembles Sinbad which was a bonus!  :)"}
{"text":"Great hangout spot.  Very nice bartender who makes you feel welcome. . Comeck it out!  Free pbr or mystery shot!"}
{"text":"Certainly not fine dining, but the food is excellent! The atmosphere is very southern and rustic, but comfortable and friendly. We tried several types of meat and different sauces and they were all great. Our waitress, Annie, did a super job guiding us through all the options. Even tho I was full, she insisted that I try the beef brisket with the mustard sauce - it was fabulous! One caution....be careful how much you order, the portions are large!"}
{"text":"They have specials daily a 2 meat 1/2 lb combo with an 8oz side and 24 oz drink for $20. Win! And they feature every local brewery on tap at the bar upstairs. Great atmosphere and amazing customer service. Cant wait to come here again."}
{"text":"We went to the Tavern after visiting the Pawn Shop. Great atmosphere with a great bartender. You can sit inside, out in the balcony area, or there is a roped off area just outside the tavern to sit with alcoholic beverages. There was an area downstairs where they had speakers, guitars & various other items to buy. All the parking attendants were very helpful also. We did not eat so unfortunately I cannot speak to the BBQ part. Definitely recommend to stop by if you're looking for something off the beaten path of the strip."}
{"text":"Why is there a bar here? I don't know but it is fucking awesome. The bar tender Kelly makes the night. So much fun thanks Kelli"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, entertainment, friendliest staff in Vegas.  What more could you possibly want? Well, if they gave everything away for free, that'd be nice, but then they RRRSBBQ wouldn't exist anymore."}
{"text":"Omg I'm reading the reviews and I'm surprised no one has complained about the price! We really thought Chumlee needed bail money again! 2 Sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 sodas $40 bucks!!!! We thought we were being robbed since the cashier didn't even ring in the order! She said \"40 even\" and put the money on the side of the register! Mediocre Sandwich compared to the ones we buy in Scottsdale, AZ for a lot less! The place was completely empty-I should've known!"}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of co-workers.  There were about 15 of us all together.  We usually go to Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nobody was impressed.  Most of us were disappointed.    Burnt ends = Excellent!  Baby back ribs = Tough and chewy. I would take Chili's or TGI Fridays or Tony Roma's any day over these.  Pulled pork = Co-worker said it was too spicy (even with no sauce) for her. Would not even eat it.  Mac and cheese = Co-worker said it had tons of pepper in it.  Would not even eat it.   Spicy sausage = The sausage was dried up and tough like it was cooked hours ago.   Loaded mashed potatoes = \"Sorry we ran out.\"  Loaded baked potato = \"Sorry we ran out.\"  Cornbread = Was OK.  Collard greens = Was OK.  Prices were high for what you get.  Portions were small, very small.   Sorry Rick, I love you guys ... but I think we're going to stick to Memphis Championship BBQ."}
{"text":"So many different takes on bbq it's amazing what they do with brisket, ribs, chicken, hotlink, pork loin, pig shanks, pork belly, meatloaf. I tried the redneck nacho which is there version of a Frito pie with the addition of your choice of meat ,beans, cheese, some mamas sweet sauce, sour cream covered with fresh spring onions. Another plate we ordered were the bbq tacos with potato salad and pork grinds that they make in house with there rub. By the way they have a bar with the most breweries I've seen on tap in a while. And if they don't they might have a tall can of your favorite brew. All in all I would definitely give them two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We love trying out new restaurants whenever we go to Vegas, and were in the mood for some BBQ. Rollin' Smoke was nearby, so we decided to try it out.  I will say, before walking in I thought it would be a touristy BBQ joint. It shares the parking lot with the Pawn Stars shop and the building looks a little hipster.   We were greeted by a guy behind the counter commenting on my t-shirt. He began talking basketball with us and he seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.  Looking at the menu, I could see that this place knew how to do brisket. They had options of chopped, sliced, or burnt ends. I got half sliced and half chopped. The worker went and grabbed the full slab of meat to cut it in front of us.  The sauces included a sweet sauce, which tastes better than it sounds. Unlike other sweet sauces, this one isn't syrupy and cloyingly sweet. Then there's the Arkansauce, which is truly unique, perfectly concocting pepper, tomato, and meat sauces in one.  The chopped brisket was so flavorful and moist we didn't even need sauce at all. But if you choose to, I recommend the sweet sauce. It runs over it nicely and only adds to the amazing quality of meat.   The sliced brisket is almost as good. It's less fatty, but you'd never guess by how easily your teeth slice through it. Both meat options are reminiscent of genuine Texas brisket in every way.  My only gripe here is the price. It's $16 per 1/2 lb of brisket--so $32 per pound. That's a little steep. I realize it's in Vegas and the meat is fantastic, but I think charging by the pound would be smarter--maybe $25 per pound. For those who don't eat a lot of BBQ, $16 per half pound doesn't seem like much, but it's very far above average. If you get the combo, it's $20 and it comes with a side and a drink. The sides are usually $4 a la carte--so you basically get the drink for free.  For the sides, I highly recommend the mac & cheese. I got the baked sweet potato, which is an extra $2 and not really worth it.   Each meal also comes with a slice of Texas toast, smartly placed underneath the meat so that it gets nice a soggy (trust me, it's amazing).  I will definitely be back here, but perhaps only order the meat by itself and get a larger portion of the side to share instead of both of us getting a meal (I don't drink soda).   It's great that Vegas has a quality BBQ spot for locals to get some brisket cooked the right way."}
{"text":"Rick's is just as good as they say it is.    Good, honest BBQ with plenty of savory sides.  Service is quick.  The sides are on the skinny side but tasty.    Take your meal upstairs and enjoy it with on of a dozen micro brews.   Not  sure what they call it but you can order a draft beer with a rib and slider all hooked together as one fancy drink."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. I highly recommend coming in on a weekend and paying $40 for unlimited meat and PBR.  The price is pretty pricey if you're going to get a meal, a side, and a beer, so you might as well do the unlimited package!  The only negative is that it sometimes can take a while to get your beer because the insist on bringing it out to you.  Also, important to note that locals get 20% off! Makes their prices a lot more reasonable, IMO."}
{"text":"I came back to Ricks Rollin Smoke BBQ on Las Vegas Blvd. It is quickly becoming my favorite BBQ place in Las Vegas. I ordered the trio and the meats I chose were Burnt ends, pulled pork, chicken and ribs. My sides were Mac and cheese and Cajun coleslaw. OMFG THE MEAT WAS DA BOMB!!!!! You can definitely taste and smell the smoke. I Love that. If you are going to smoke meat then smoke the hell out of it and they did and it is so freaking good. So tender and flavorful. Then you dip into that yellow chesse goodness that is just divine. I cried as I ate it. I LOVE YOU MAC N CHEESE!!! Seriously go eat at this place. It's insanely good."}
{"text":"Nothing like disappointment for dinner!  Surprised to see all of these 5 star reviews...Hmm?!?  I was talked into getting the special (2 meats-1 slice of white bread-1 side-souvenir cup/drink) for $20, you get a discount if you're a local.  I was shocked to see that the meat I was given was literally, 4 pieces of thinly sliced hot links and 3 pieces of thinly sliced beef brisket, a smaller than normal size side and a small souvenir soda cup, which was nothing but a cheapy thin-plastic cup.   Waaay OVER priced for the quantity of food that you get and to top it off, the quality is subpar and lacking.   The bbq sauce is runny and bland. The brisket is dry and flavorless. The hot links are nothing but hot...that is literally all you taste is overpowering heat!   Definitely a touristy spot/trap.   Only good thing I can say about this place is, the meat carver/servers where really nice."}
{"text":"Good selection of alcohol. Real chill bartender. Try the mystery shot. Good selection of bbq sauces. Too bad rick wasn't here but nice atmosphere. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Brisket is on point! Service was great! The only thing I wish they had are some items off their other location menu. I get why they don't since its located in a spot that lots of tourists be at. I definitely plan on coming back since its conveniently located by my job."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drink , great prices and atmosphere.  Friendly service and a great place to relax those sore legs after walking the strip"}

{"text":"We stopped in Vegas and deliberated a lot on where to eat. Had been craving BBQ and decided to head over to this second location of Rick's Rollin. It was a Monday night. Complete dead at around 9pm. Okay, fine. We shouldn't be that surprised it's not NYC and it's about a mile from the main part of the strip.   The food though? All the food came out luke warm at best. Brisket was extremely overcooked. Ribs were just okay, but again you could totally tell that it wasn't fresh. At least, heat up the food all the damn way. Mac and cheese was meh. By the end of the meal, everything was completely cold.   Very disappointing. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Herd of this place a few years back and it definitely lived up to the hype.Best BBQ in Vegas."}
{"text":"Finally all you tourists that just gotta check out the pawn shop can have some pretty good barbeque here. Now I dont know how Rick Harrison ended up with his name being included in the title but I can only guess when your barbeque is damn good you tend to gain some notariety. That and you were offered a spot in their new plaza-like setting. I guess its a win-win for both parties.  Now for the food. I gave the original Rollin Smoke location 5 stars. Why? Because its a stone's throw away from Spearmint Rhino! Ok, maybe that shouldnt qualify but hay, making it rain does make one hungry so hoppin on over to RS should be a no brainer.   Sorry to stray off the main subject there, as a guy, I tend to get easily distracted and strip clubs tend to be one of them. Unlike the original location, this new place does not serve beef ribs at the moment. The beef ribs are mainly the number one reason I go to RS because I havnt had anything like them anywhere. Here it is a limited menu. The prices seem to be marked up as well but that should be expected since they are technically on the strip still.   What I ended up getting was the 2 meat combo ($19.99) which comes with a side and a drink. Your meat choices are pulled pork, beef hot links, chopped brisket, smoked chicken, or st louis ribs. Your side choices are bbq baked beans, cole slaw, mashed potatos, and mac n cheese. I chose chopped brisket and st louis ribs. As usual both meats were on point. The brisket was a little bit greasy this time around but still good. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone smoke flavored goodness! Mac n cheese was just ok.  Some random useful info: When you order your meats, they will ask you if you want sweet barbeque sauce on it or on the side. They also have a spicy and a really spicy barbeque sauce but you have to ask for it. On the tables they have their standard barbeque sauce. They also have wall outlets everywhere for your convenience so you can charge your phone or laptop. Just like the beef ribs, they told me that they dont have wifi for now as well. There are tables outside. Locals get 20 percent off their order. Hours are 10 am to 10 pm everyday. There is a bar right above where they serve appetizers and alcoholic beverages.  In closing, I dont understand why you would have a limited menu when this location is gonna breed surefire success. I would rather have you not open just yet in order to make it right with a complete menu. You cannot deny the people their beef ribs, outlaw burger, and smoked meatloaf not to mention fried catfish, more sides, and dessert. The marked up prices def will take advantage of you out of towners.  Yelp 2015 Review #70 \"Rollin Smoke aint no joke!\" 568 overall"}
{"text":"If this is really rated the best barbecue In Las Vegas that's pretty sad. I had  the 3 meat dinner.  It comes with one side and a drink.  The ridiculous price for this was $28.  I live in Wichita Kansas and a dinner like this would come in at 1/2 this price. Where  I'm from an all you can eat  barbecue buffet would cause $19.50.  Here it's an outrageous $40 for all you can eat in one hour.  Now that you know it's extremely overpriced let's talk about the quality.  The brisket and pulled pork were both extremely dry. The taste was ok but certainly nothing for bragging rights.  The hot link was good.  The sauces were good.  The Arkansauce had a little bit of kick to it.   I preferred the Sweet Mama sauce.  You will need lots of it for the dry meat. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but certainly not addictive.  The service was friendly. The building was what you would expect of a typical barbecue restaurant.  This restaurant would not be in the running for the best in Wichita Kansas.  In fact the price alone for most barbecue restaurants would put this one out of business."}
{"text":"Relaxing venue that smells like smoked meats and campfire. They have different events every night including karaoke night, comedy night, etc. The patio has a terrific view of Vegas Blvd. The relaxed atmosphere will make you feel like you're around friends, and the bbq ranks among the best in town."}
{"text":"Take advantage of the friendly staff - they are passionate about the food and are pleased to make recommendations. We showed up hungry, asked for suggestions and loved every morsel. So good - we ate there twice."}
{"text":"Nice service and a fun environment in a great location.  Friendly service and nice casual comfortable bar area Excellently crafted cocktails and were given complimentary shots to start us off right. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie at Eclipse. Could smell the food half a mile down the street and man did it smell GOOD! We came about 40 mins prior to closing so it was pretty dead. Not only was the food amazing, the employees were some of the nicest people I have ever encountered. Every single one of them was incredibly sweet and hospitable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in today & experienced great customer service. Koree is awesome. Food & drinks were great, definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This was fantastic! The pulled pork was moist, not full of fat and flavorful.  There were gorgeous  smoke rings on the meat. You received  a  big portion, which I devoured, of the pork. The bbq sauce options were South Carolina Mustard, Eastern  NC vinegar, and a more Kansas City tomato based sauce which comes either spicy or sweet. I opted for the sweet, but my husband chose Eastern NC and we were both happy. There  are great sides available. I had slaw which was slightly  spicy, but still a nice cool counterpoint  to the rich pork. The baked beans were incredible. Unlike  other baked beans, these backed beans had small chunks of meat, not fat, in them. The sauce was redolent  with onions and a thick flavorful  tomato  sauce. The was great looking cornbread, but I did not have any as the potions were so big. There were good-looking  desserts available,  but who had room to eat them?           The restaurant itself is one in which you place your orders at the counter and then sit on stools and eat at the counters that run throughout the restaurant. I think that there is outdoor seating as well, but we sat inside. The Staff is very knowledgeable , upbeat, friendly and positive that they have the best bbq in town. Although I haven't  had other bbq in Vegas, I have eaten my way through the South,  Kansas City and Texas. I know good bbq and this \"Q\" was outstanding, a little pricy, but worth it.      Great opportunity  to enjoy some casual dining."}
{"text":"Outstanding brisket moist and juicy. I was very surprise to find this in Vegas. If you in the neighborhood you must stop in to have some. The bake beans were delicious too. Kudos to the chef"}
{"text":"Great brews, good company, awesome BBQ! Right by Pawn Stars, owned by the owner of Pawn Stars. Come here! It's nice inside! Cool bar. Matt, the bartender, he's good and makes a good homemade brewskie!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. Hands down. Friendly staff. White glove clean. I will be back and bring more friends."}
{"text":"New place next to Pawn shop on LV Blvd. friendly quick service.  Great brisket.  Also have pulled pork, ribs, chicken & links.  Have 2 sauces, original is sweet with a little spice. All the traditional sides.  Tried the chipotle slaw (didn't like) at their other restaurant so I skipped it here. I had potato salad which was topped with bacon & green onion; tastee. Upstairs is a bar/pub serves same food. Rick sometimes bar tends."}
{"text":"Get Jeremey's signature chicken tacos. You will not be disappointed. In addition, the employees are extremely courteous and informative regarding the menu. Also had the brisket and was not short of awesome. Great location in old Vegas. Almost forgot - beer and upstairs bar for more options."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that the bartender was pretty cool.  The food was delicious but definitely not the quantities indicated on the menu.  I had 1 beer, 1/2 slab of ribs (approximately 5 bones), the hot links (definitely much less than 11oz) and 2 sides. $49.00.  I don't think I'll be back.  I could have gone to Famous Daves and gotten more food for much less."}
{"text":"Best bbq ribs in town! If you're looking for real western country bbq to give you that sticky fingers experience this is it! Pork rack of ribs smothered in smokey, spicy n sweet bbq sauce! Hmm Mmmm good! Juicy, fall off the bone & delicious! This joint is inside right off of a street in downtown but once you dig in you feel like you're somewhere in Texas out on a ranch outside having an outdoor bbq. The wood benches and decor of the restaurant really helps with that imagination. The cornbread oh my! So good I could eat some everyday!  The Mac and cheese, the smokey baked beans everything is just so good.  A bit pricey but so worth it and the staff is so friendly and inviting! I forgot his name but the Asian guy behind the counter is always there when we come at night and we go a lot. He's great, awesome service and welcoming ambience! All they need are the cowboy hats to add to the experience!"}

{"text":"This was my first time at new location.  I really enjoyed the BBQ I got at the original location so I was hopping for the same good BBQ.  I was it disappointed.  This location seriously touristy.  It is set up for the fans of the Pawn Stars show.  That is not why I came here as I wanted some BBQ to take home.     As it was slow the guys running the place told me I would have to go upstairs to the bar to order.  After realizing I had no idea where the bar was they let me order with them.  I got to give them a shout out for being cool about that.     I order 3 dinners to take home and the guy ringing me up asked if I was a local and once I told him yes he adds - cool we give locals 20% off!  I ordered two pulled pork and chopped brisket and one chopped brisket and spicy sausage.   I also ordered the chipotle slaw, potato salad and spicy macaroni and cheese.  All were good with the spicy macaroni and cheese being the standout.  It definitely was spicy but not overpowering.     Their BBQ is tasty with good smoke flavor.  The pulled pork was my favorite with the spicy sausage being a close second.  I did like the brisket but not a fan of having it chopped up.  Their BBQ sauce is Sweet with a slight tang which I really enjoyed.    I did truly enjoy the BBQ but wish it came with more BBQ sauce, the brisket wasn't chopped and they didn't put the bread in the bottom of the container with the BBQ put on top.  Small things I will get differently on my next visit."}
{"text":"Rolled into ricks on the bike bar and ricks hooked us up with great drinks and BBQ!  Our bar tender was on top of our order and the top level patio was great.  We are the sausage, pulled pork, and stuffed potato with brisket."}
{"text":"Well. Rick's Rollin Smoke Barbeque & tavern made the trip worth it. No matter what you loose in Vegas at the tables, Ricks makes it worth it.   Not only does Rick actually bar tend (And is a damn good fun guy to laugh with) but the food is stupid good!!   $40 gets you all you can eat and drink (PBR) for an hour. Let me just tell you this, I had to call it done at the 20 minute mark. The food was that good that I just busted through everything I could. I wanted more. But my stomach wanted to slap me across the face.   Do yourself a favor, and make plans to stop here on your next trip!!"}
{"text":"Awesome..,,,,great staff, great food,,,,,I'll be back as often as possible!     I've had bbq all over our great country and must say RRSBBQ is up there with the best of them"}
{"text":"Bartender is awesome.  Place is a great hangout for both locals and tourists alike.  Come check it out after pawn stars."}
{"text":"First time here, I had the brisket salad and a side of pork rinds. The service was great. Friendly and helpful. The brisket salad hit the spot. My only constructive criticism would be on the pork rinds.   I expected more since I don't usually see pork rinds on a menu. The rinds were of a run of the mill store bought type. The batch I had was a little stale.   I would use the Mexican style pork rind known as a (Chicharrón) this type would be a hit I'm sure.    I'll definitely be back to try more of the BBQ. I'm sure I could bump up my STARS in the future."}

Love it   But they need a new corn bread recipe or something that's my only complaint lol"}
{"text":"I'm obviously going to be a fan since I'm obsessed with the original location. I thought parking would be a nightmare but it was actually a breeze. Someone asked me if I was local and I said yes and they let me Park for free. I love a place that appreciates the locals.   Once inside the prices seemed a little high, but I love their BBQ and I was hungry. I ordered the brisket and he informed me that locals device 20%off. It's totally my fault for ignoring the price for sides and drinks... But $5 for cole slaw is robbery! I wasn't thrilled that my soda (including a plastic souvenir cup) was $5 either. The brisket was exactly as i remember it and I really like the BBQ sauce. I like a nice mix of the original and spicy. Perfection!   The original location is actually slightly closer to my work, and the prices are a little better (even with 20% off) so I think I'll stick to that one as my main location, but this is great for anyone interested in the pawn shop show."}
{"text":"The place itself is cool.  I took my nephew here as he is a fan of Pawn Stars.  The problem in the bar is a DJ interrupting songs constantly to tell jokes that are redundant and after the 6th time...unfunny.  It would be a nicer experience without a filthy mouthed DJ  that cant shut up long enough to let a song play.  The service was ok.  Good selection.  Honestly, I will visit again and try the food.  But if the DJ IS there, I will take it to go."}
{"text":"Love when family is visiting because that just means we get to explore and try new things. Driving my brother-in-law around Vegas and I asked if he's been to the Pawn Stars establishment. He says yes, but he wants to try out the BBQ. Hooray! Thank goodness he understood what I was hinting at.  Their parking lot has always been small. We got there right before lunch and luckily, the parking lot wasn't as busy as I was able to immediately get a parking space. Love that this restaurant is on the ground floor.  My brother-in-law and I didn't want to eat a whole lot, although the All You Can Eat at $40/person was appealing. We opted for the Brisket Sandwich combo which also comes with mac n' cheese, pork and beans and a drink. Total price, $25. Glad we were sharing because that is a pricey. Luckily, the drink cup was the souvenir drink cup which is normally $5. We liked the brisket sandwich. I poured the pork and beans over the mac n' cheese and that was great.  The restaurant workflow makes sense. You walk in, you stand in line at the counter and give the server your order, followed by the cashier, fountain drinks and utensils. The entire restaurant is \"pub\" seating, either window seats or shared large eating counter.  Between every couple of seats are napkin dispensers along with different sauces you can try, including Sweet and Arkansas. Everything made sense, everything was clean.  I'll definitely be back to share the experience with my family and friends who are Pawn Star fans."}
{"text":"I was at ricks bar last night the food was awful, Rick was bartending and constantly running outside to smoke cigarettes, Gross.. And I noticed every person who has asked for a picture he said ask him and pointed to his asswipe shadow who followed him everywhere.. Antwon , So I asked Rick to take a picture and referred me to Antwon, couldn't be more dissapointment with Rick and the establishment.. It's obvious the guy stepped into shit when the history channel came into his life.. He must have been a failure before then..Now he thinks he's better than everyone else, I met plenty of reality stars in the past and they were all gracious, Not Rick, proved to be the biggest jerkoff I have ever met from the world of reality tv.."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Friday 3/30/18. The tempting BBQ smell drew us in. It was not busy for the prime-time lunch hour. The inside of the take-out restaurant was much colder than most establishments. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich for $13 and my friend ordered the \"biggin\" sandwich (brisket, pulled pork, & hotlink) for $16. All the meat and rolls were served COLD. They didn't even hide the fact that they took the meat and rolls directly from the refrigerator. The BBQ sauce on top was the only thing heating the meat. Huh?? The $8 side of \"loaded potato\" was a small cup of instant mashed potatoes with some cheese and bacon bits on top. The man serving us said he gave me extra meat on my sandwich, but it looked like the appropriate amount for the roll; not anything over-the-top. I am a petite woman and was STARVING after eating this cold meat. Outrageous for the price. Definitely would not return. Tourist trap."}
{"text":"Rollin Smoke is excellent, Rick's Rollin Smoke, well, its basically a TOURIST TRAP. This particular one is owned by the guy who owns the pawn shop (Pawn Stars). The food will be decent, but its not as good as the other locations. It is more expensive, and quite frankly, you get less food. I am a local and eat Rolling Smoke A-LOT. My favorite one being on highland. They happened to be out of brisket, so I came to this Rollin Smoke. No corn nuggets (bro, get a fryer) and some of the smallest portions I have ever seen. You fit my 2 bbq sauces and my side (which is in its own container) in the same container as my 3 meat combo. How is this possible?? None of the other Rolling Smokes do this. You get loaded with meat (especially a 3 meat combo) at the other locations and sides are in the bag. (my order was to go).  Got a local discount and this still came to $48.  Extremely disappointed when I got home with the lack of food.   2 stars because the people were nice, and it tastes like Rolling Smoke."}
{"text":"\"The Old Man\" cocktail is a modern twist on the classic Old Fashion. Bourbon straight from the barrel. A perfect 10"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad BBQ and it wasn't great BBQ. I'm definitely more a John Mull's fan! If a tourist without a rental car asked about a BBQ spot located near public transportation, I'd recommend this place, but I don't necessarily see myself going back here again. The customer service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful but if I can make any complaint it'd be that the restaurant was SO COLD, so freakin cold, that my food was only hot for about five minutes and then it tasted like I was eating leftovers from my fridge."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to the airport and flight home. If you watch Pawn Stars on TV, the restaurant is right across the parking lot. Excellent service upstairs in an opening air loft seating area. We ordered three combo plates with ribs, pulled pork, brisket, chicken and hot links with three sides; Mac and cheese, cornbread and baked beans for six of us and everyone was full when we were done. Tasty."}
{"text":"This is probably my second favorite bbq place in Vegas I love there ribs,but still must give my edge to John mulls the food is better and you get more bang for your buck.."}
{"text":"Very yummy.  I can walk there from work, so I will definitely be back.  20% locals discount.  Only downside is that it is not the complete menu from the other Rollin Smoke BBQ.  I will definitely be going back often.    I went with a friend and we split a hot link sandwich and a pulled chicken baked potato.  Both were very good.  With just the sandwich, I would suggest also getting a side.  The potato was huge though, so splitting both was more than enough."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a co-worker and we had talked about it for months. Knowing where the original location is made us both a bit iffy, but after a quick search, I found this location in Pawn Plaza. I made the trip to Vegas with my mom and sister and quickly decided we would have lunch here while we were in town. Definitely one of the best choices I made. The prices are a big high, but for BBQ this good, it's definitely worth it. I had the Duo Combo with burnt ends brisket, pulled pork, potato salad, and for an extra $5 I got beef ribs. This was one of my favorite meals in Vegas and I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Bartender is awesome!   Will come back. Best place in Vegas so far.   Come check out the local beers they have available."}
{"text":"Expensive but so good! Great Service! We are all happy. I have the ribs the brisket and mac and cheese and a potato salad excellent!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? $17.00 for a 1/2 pound of mediocre brisket? Rick do what you do best. Taking advantage of people when there down and out. That is your calling. Your good at that. Get out of the restaurant business. I am not going to explain all of the nuances it takes to be successful in the restaurant business. You don't have the capacity or the time to learn them. Again do what you do best. I give you 2 more years in the BBQ business. Cut your losses! I know your sucking wind on this investment. Getting out early will be the least painful thing you can do."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place 4 stars because the bartender upstairs taking care of us was so awesome and attentive but not overbearing. She was super nice and constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing okay! But the food was just not there for me. Between myself and 4 friends, everything we got seemed to have a similar \"kick\". There was a spice that really made everything hot and it was literally on all the food, from Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes to ribs, sandwiches, and even a salad; all of our mouthes were burning! Through the spice you could taste how good the food was but right when you stared to enjoy the bite you took, your mouth was assaulted by another punch of spice. Also, I felt like the menu was very repetitive, I know it's a BBQ place but it felt like your only option was some kind of pork in BBQ sauce or super corny typical BBQ food. I would love to have seen some different types of food done BBQ style or new concoctions made with random types of food. Or I don't know maybe I'm crazy and I never knew I just don't like BBQ food. Either way, the atmosphere is really fun, the people that work there are really really awesome, but between myself and friends, none of us liked our food and definitely wouldn't recommend it. Maybe come for drinks and a good hangout spot but either skip the food or be very very clear that you don't want anything to have any kind of spice in it and see if they have anything off the menu that's not sooooo overdone traditional BBQ."}
{"text":"\"I've been watching 'Pawn Stars' every week for the last year. I like learning about the history behind the items that people bring into the pawnshop. I actually pawned a ring once that a woman sent to me while I was on 'Jerry Springer.' It was really gaudy.\" Steve Wilkos  Personally I kinda wish I could pawn the flavor left on my taste buds.  Let me start off by saying that I have had food from the original location of Rollin Smoke BBQ and that was was pretty special. You would think the food at this location would be just as special.  My younger daughter, here's a surprise she wanted to eat mac n cheese. My wife took a bite of the mac n cheese. For a side dish that cost $8.00 she, my wife, said it tasted like it came from a can. My daughter at the age of seven was not impressed as well.   My older daughter, age nine, choose to eat a cheeseburger. The portion size was fine, but she was not to favorable for it's taste. I took a bite and thought I was taking a bite from a meatloaf sandwich.   Myself I ordered BBQ Taco for $12.00. My meal came with a side dish of cole slaw. I also ordered some baked beans. I liked my side dishes more than I liked my tacos.  Service was nice, the establishment inside was very clean. Then again it was only 11:30am.  Located in a brand new shopping area right next to the shop made famous on the television show Pawn Stars.   I love the food from the other location, but here, and with Rick's name on it, something was missing. My wife and I agree, we didn't get the bang for our buck. I do feel like we payed for the name along with the location, and not so much the food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The pulled pork is a must try and their sauces are the best in the land. Located right next to pawn stars."}
{"text":"2 stars for a solid BBQ joint with one glaring problem.  After checking out the famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop from the television show \"Pawn Stars,\" we headed next door to the BBQ shop owned by show's star, Rick. The joint, called Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern, is a 2-story venue with what looked like a take out area on the bottom level and a bar and outdoor area on the top level. The venue's style as a BBQ joint is well executed and made this Kansas City boy feel like he was back in the Midwest.  We sat down at a table and a bartender came over to say hello and bring us menus. She also let us know that Rick himself would be bartending tonight, so we were free to stick around to see him or come back and see would make sure we be able to get a drink from him. I appreciated that she was very friendly and overall provided good service.   After looking over the rather extensive menu (including a good sized beer list), my wife and I decided to get a couple beers and some sliders. While our dinner reservations kept us from ordering more, both the beers and sliders we received were rather solid. The venue, service and food all corresponded with the venue's 4 star status.   What is unfortunate is that, while the venue's food and experience merit 4 star reviews (and would have gotten one from me), it takes the extremely inappropriate step of manipulating its rating. It does this with a little sign on the table, listed in the picture below, offering a free PBR or mystery shot in exchange for being willing to \"Yelp us out.\" Since the sign instructed me to ask the server for details, I asked the server and she told me that we would only receive the free drinks in exchange for a good review! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! This is an absolutely despicable policy that hurts Yelp (posting of inauthentic reviews), insults Yelpers who look to provide honest input and the venue itself because it is less likely to receive constructive criticism that would help it improve. It is one thing to encourage people to write a review for a drink (a little shady in its own right since people would most likely avoid criticizing the venue since it could jeopardize receiving their free drink, but outweighed by the benefit of getting people to write reviews), but offering free drinks for a review AND requiring the reviews to be good crosses the line. The saddest part about this is that the venue would almost assuredly get good reviews and repeat business based on its merits, but this policy is so harmful and insulting that I refuse to go back to this location and recommend everyone avoid it until the policy is eliminated or at the very least reworked to remove the positive review requirement. While the official policy may not involve the positive review requirement, the servers would need to be instructed that this isn't a requirement and the sign updated to reflect that the content of the review wouldn't impact receiving the drink.  Overall, Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern is a solid BBQ location with a great atmosphere and menu full of good options. Unfortunately, the abhorrent Yelp policy makes this a place a must avoid for any self-respecting Yelper."}
{"text":"Boooooo! Thumbs down. Rick happened to be at his bar that evening. Prior to heading up my friends and I ate below at \"ricks\" rollin smoke BBQ. Food was ok, woulda been better if it was actually hot. (Go to the real ROLLIN Smoke BBQ on highland for better experience). As we made our way to his bar, we were exited to see him, but as we got closer to him he didn't seem too thrilled about the customers in his establishment. All we wanted was a picture with him. He had to ask his bodyguard to see if it was ok. As Rick chain puffed on his cigarette, we ordered a drink and chatted thinking he might stroll by and check on his customers, NOPE. Part of owning a business is customer service. You gotta bend over backwards to customers so they keep coming back. You are the name of this plaza and I sure as heck didn't feel appreciated the night I drove up to your place. This place is nothing special, Rick is. I thing special. He's just a name, he lost his heart & soul a few years back. I was a fan of him, his show, and how he conducted business BUT now he's a shadow getting walked all over and spit on."}
{"text":"20.00 for 1/2 pound of meat and a side??? 5.00 for a drink??? 3.00 for a bottle of water??? 5.00 - 6.00 for a side???. I had a side of beans, or should I say bean soup. It was a Friday night at 7pm when most eateries are fairly busy and only 6 people in the whole bottom floor of the plaza. $ in the BBQ and 2 on the patio. The others gave good reviews, but if those reviews were true where was the business on a Friday night? The food was just ok but the prices were way over what they should be for a get it yourself food bar. The chairs ( stools ) were very hard and uncomfortable and forget about putting a child at the table with out a net incase the kid fell off the stool. Didn't bother with the upper level. Rick, you talk about Big Hoss and Chum messing up, but you messed up big time with this Plaza."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Yes, three times!!! The most amazing barbecue (truly) and fun, friendly staff! Be sure to visit the tavern upstairs for drinks afterwards. Really great people here!"}
{"text":"One word- Delicious!!  We were taking a tour and our tour guide highly recommended this place to us and we are so glad that he did!  The people working here were super friendly and quick! The restaurant itself was set up very nicely and very clean!  I highly highly recommend that you try their mac and cheese! It may be my new favorite food! All the other food was delicious as well- my boyfriend loved the pulled pork sandwich and cornbread!"}
{"text":"Much needed food spot next to the Pawn Shop.  Also went with the 2 meat special and was satisfied.  Ran into Rick H. at the bar upstairs and he took a pic with my kid."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the best BBQ in town. The burnt tips are a must! And locals get an awesome drink deal!!"}
{"text":"The service was good, prices were a little high and the food wasn't anything special.  Had the ribs and brisket, not much smoke flavor just taste the sauce.  Had better BBQ."}
{"text":"This is located right next to the Pawn Stars store.  The BBQ place is in the Plaza next to it, which features stores named after the stars of the series.  Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern is named after Rick Harrison. However, I did not realize that until afterwards.  When there are awards prominently placed in an establishment, that catches my attention!  I need to investigate!  There were 5 adults and 1 child.  We ordered 2 three choice meats/ with 3 choices of sides to share.  We had leftovers.  My sons could not stop raving about the pulled pork.  That was some of the best pulled pork I've ever tasted too.  There were 3 guys working that day.  All of them were friendly and helpful.  When we visit Vegas, this will probably be a place we'll come to visit."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious!! I had the pulled chicken sandwich. Totally melts in your mouth, ate the sandwich quickly."}
{"text":"If you like good bbq go here. I had their burger and it came out almost 12\" tall with deep fried onion strings on top. The patty was grilled perfectly. It was delicious. Be warned though I'm a big eater and I had a hard time finishing it but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Pulled chicken was good. Not sure what type of bun it was put on to make a sandwich. It was an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"One amazing BBQ spot.. Definitely worth the drive off the strip... Order their mask that has all the meats because they are all spectacular... The Mac n cheese is awesome!"}
{"text":"From the home of BBQ, and of the places I've been to on the strip, this is #1. Great food, great service, A+++ BBQ."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! The pulled pork was delicious and the mac and cheese is so good!! A must have when in Vegas!  on top of this the service and staff were so nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it.The food was amazing. Matt hooked it up. Most definitely I will be coming back. Great way to end my Vegas weekend."}
{"text":"Nice friendly workers, greet you at door, food smells great, my big complaint, they charge 10.00 for beef rib, one piece only ten dollors, when see its a shot rib, waiting for a big bone to come out it was a short rib style. Lots of beef on it this should be two pieces instead of one. It taste good. One was tender and the other piece was brought was little dry. We will come back but try something else before i bring friends and family."}
{"text":"This place was just meh. Okay, if you will. We ordered the Pit Special. It came with pulled pork, brisket, spare ribs, hot links and chicken. For our sides, we chose collard greens, coleslaw, and dirty rice. We were underwhelmed, as another Yelper stated. The chicken was ok, lightly dry seasoned, and the pulled pork was good with a nice smoke. However, the brisket was minced and greasy. It had the look and texture of cat food. Hot links tasted and had the texture of processed gas station pepperoni sticks.  Spare ribs were just okay, I've had better at Memphis or even Lucille's. As for the sides, the coleslaw was my favorite, was not heavily dressed and had a bit of kick because of the chipotle. Dirty rice was a bit too salty, and the collared greens, were just okay. I'd like to say that I would come back, but I probably won't."}
{"text":"Food was incredible.  Rick showed up, which was awesome.  Bella stole the show.  What a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite barbeque place in town. And oh I must say that the sides were amazing  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Taste is good. Fair price but small restaurant like a container complex , they do not provision of liquor and parking area is small that difficult to park a car.  It was nice Texas BBQ in Las Vegas, cos here is not Texas."}
{"text":"Great music, friendly staff, nice place to catch the sunset and people watch. Located in the same parking lot as Gold & Silver Pawn. Lots of free parking. Walking distance to Downtown."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! Check out the bar upstairs for sure. You may even see THE Rick bartending! They have great food and drink specials everyday. THE place to go for bbq in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've had BBQ from the original Rollin Smoke BBQ location many times and am a huge fan. This location did not disappoint either.   Since this is a secondary location you won't find the full menu available at the original location. You will find all of the meats, but they are for purchase by the pound instead of as part of a meal. The sides offered are a condensed listing, but there are still great options available. This location is set up more for sharing than for individual meals. This was fine since my husband and I wanted to share as part of our food crawl that day.  We had the half a rack of St. Louis style ribs and a side of Bacon Potato Salad. Yum on both. The ribs were smoky, meaty, and tender. I love the traditional sauce on the ribs. The potato salad has a great flavor and plenty of bacon.   The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Service is definitely top notch here. Locals get 20% off of this great BBQ as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, within walking distance from Silver and ahold pawn shop (famous from the hit show Pawn Stars) we went up just to grab a beer and sit at the bar. It's mostly outside so in the dead of summer I'd recommend going in the evening. We also heard that Rick Harrison bartends there on the weekends! Which would be awesome to see if you're around the area."}
{"text":"Meanwhile on a Sensational Sunny Sunday Our Hero Foodie & DJ Legend Cowboy Finds Himself In Las Vegas At #Rickharrisons From #Pawnstars BBQ Place heard lot of bout it So here ta check it out I ordered the Some Saint Louis Ribs that were Tender Smokey and Yummy I also had the Old Mans (Ricks Fathers) Favorite \"THE BIGGIN\" its a Hotlink Smothered with Chop Brisket and Pulled Pork all in one sandwich Hmmmm what can I say about THE BIGGIN this sandwich just sounds yummy and this case it was I would only make a few slight changes the Bun  should be either toasted or fresh made and I would do something like add sauce or juice from the meat because the pulled pork was just a little dry but trust me this sandwich is still extremely yummy but I think with those additions this sandwich with knock you off your feet and did I mention that Hotlink was very good had a nice old fashioned hotdog snap and nice hot spicy bite yummmm the place overall looks nice it was clean the staff was cool at knowledgeable and plenty of nice outside places to sit as well as a nice air condition spots they even deliver and cater events in the end this is a really nice place to check out when you're in Vegas I didn't get a chance to try to smoke chicken wings I know I know that's my thang but it just gives me another reason to come back good job guyz#BBQ #Foodie #DjCowboy #FoodLasVegas"}
{"text":"Ordered a pound of brisket, baked beans and chipotle slaw--the food was wonderful and the employees were very helpful and fun.  The place is set up a little like Chipotle Restaurant where it is cafeteria style.  You pick your meat, pulled pork, beef hot links, pulled chicken or chopped brisket.  You can eat it with or without bread--they will make a sandwich, give you small rolls to make sliders or just eat the meat.  Baked beans, Mac and Cheese, Chipotle slaw and bacon potato salad.  They give generous portions and the food is good.  We will definitely return for BBQ again."}
{"text":"I keep threatening to come in here....so glad I finally have!  Super fun vibe, the locals discount rocks, delish BBQ as always...great job, Boys!  Had the Hog Feathers with Sweet Arkansauce...sweet, spicy, sticky goodness!"}
{"text":"Great bbq in Downtown Vegas.  I ordered the brisket burnt ends and they were very tender.  On the peppery side, so be warned if you're not into hot bbq seasoning.  Service was excellent.  The only downside to the experience was the price.  Burnt Ends, slice of bread, and 2 import beers ran the bill to $34."}
{"text":"OK, don't do a lot of five star ratings here. The experience must be complete. From parking to paying my bill. So far, Rollin smoke barbecue has hit all the marks. Now, we had their nachos with the brisket. Outstanding. Great flavor, the cheese is authentic and the Arkansas barbecue sauce on the side is flavorful. We went upstairs to try out a few beverages and a little bit of eats. Mark is the bartender up there and he is everybody's friend. A rare talent. The atmosphere is great especially with the balcony looking out onto Las Vegas Blvd. and the gold and silver pawn store next-door. I would recommend this to anyone. Oh, by the way, if anyone is wondering, I was not bribed to do this."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly bartender, and staff.  Arkansas Lemonade, is super good.  Great stop after touring the Pawn Shop, nice outdoor/indoor setting."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way to Freemont Experience and have to say the place was on fire. Good music, friendly bartenders, and good BBQ. Had the Sliders and every bit of them were tasty and well done. Maybe it was just the moment, but the people here were all having a good time and even Rick Harrison was bartending. This place is by far the least expensive place I came across all week. This should be on your list of places to visit, it is part of the old style Vegas without the Disney themes!!"}
{"text":"Immediately walking in you're greeted by the staff and they're so eager to help you select your BBQ fix. What's different here than most BBQ joints is that they let you sample something if you're on the fence about it. I'm always on the hunt for a good pork or beef rib so luckily they didn't have to help me too much with my lunch decision,   I must say, they are definitely doing something right with their St. Louis ribs! The succulent meat just falls right off the bone. I'm so glad I went with the half rack because three (3) ribs would have not sufficed. At the ordering counter they drizzle a bit of the Arkansauce on top but  they have three different sauces on the tables/ bar stool area that are great on the ribs as well if you want extra flavor.   Sides: Smoked Mac & Cheese, ALL DAY, ERRRDAY!  The Mac & Cheese here has a slight dark yellow color to it but don't be alarmed, it's not spicy, it's smoked! Perhaps they add the Arkansauce to it as well but trust me, this is absolutely cheesy goodness. It's rich in cheesy flavors and it pairs excellent with any BBQ of your choice. If you're going to indulge in carbs, I would highly recommend not passing up on this side!  *Little steep in their prices but I think their BBQ delivers in the flavor department so they could get away with it."}
{"text":"First Of All If I Could Give This Place ZERO Stars I Would But Unfortunately It Wouldnt Allow Me To Write A Review Without Rating In Stars ! Now Let Me Start By Saying I'm A HUGE Fan Of The Other Rollin Smokes Location I've Rarely Had Any Issues , I Happened To Be Closer To This Location And Being It Was Affiliated I Decided To Try It , You Should Be ASHAMED Of Your Sunday Night Crew Have You Ever Heard \"You Are What You Associate Yourself With\" I Got My Food Brought Out To Me By A Fat Sweaty (Like Sopping In Sweat) Dirty SLOB Who Wouldnt Know What Customer Service Was If It Slapped Him In The Face ! I Ordered My Usual Pulled Pork Piggy Sandwich What I Recieved Was The Furthest Thing From What I Get From The Other Location Ontop Of Being Served By A Soaking Sweaty Overweight Man Who Looks Like He Is A Janitor For A Living I Got A Pork Fat Sandwich On A Fucking Hot Dog Bun Are You Serious ? After Picking Through The Fat For 20 Mins I Figured Id Try And Eat The 2 Pieces Of Pulled Pork That I Had Left After Separating All The Fat Off Of It APPETIZING Right A Skimp Sandwich On A Hot Dog Bun Only To Take A Bite And Almost Throw Up Because The Bun Was Soaked From The FAT So I Threw My Pulled Fat Sandwich Made On A Soggy Hot Dog Bun In The Garbage Where This Buisness And It's Sunday Night Employees Should Go ! There Pick Up Line Was \"This Place Is So Much Better Theres NEVER A Line !\" I Should Of Took That As A Hint , Well Duhhh Jackass After You Feed People The Crap You Tried Serving Me Tonight They're Not Gonna Wanna Come Back ! Needless To Say My Hunger Pains Were Replaced With Hiccups And Nauseating Burps From The ONE Bite Of My Pulled Soggy Fatwich Smfh I Wouldnt Come Back IF THEY Paid Me ! TAKE MY ADVICE AND DRIVE THE EXTRA 5 MINS TO THE OTHER LOCATION!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok....all Celebrity hype aside.... Amazeballs BBQ. Burnt ends were to die for... Smoked Chicken and Brisket were incredible... Even the loaded baked potatoe was awesome.  Add in the fun and frivolity, and you're a fool if you don't come and have a great time...  Did I mention Bella was an amazing bartender?"}
{"text":"Good food. Had he brisket sandwich. Loaded potato was better. Decent food but way too pricy."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  love it! Ali and Bella sexy, great bartenders!!  Come by when your in town!!!"}
{"text":"OK, I gotta say upfront we are huge fans of Pawn Stars and always stop in to check out the shop whenever we come to Vegas. And after we're done we go accross the street and have a couple beers upstairs at Ricks. The drafts are $7 and he's got a great selection - I quaffed down a couple of the Rogue Dead Guy Ales and the wifey had the Hop Nuts Porter. We also had split a rack of huge baby back ribs which were pretty good considering we're from Kansas City (home of the best BBQ ribs in the world). Rick's also has some cool stuff from the shop on the wall and the breeze coming in on the top deck makes it a comfortable place to have a drink. Folks also spark up conversations quickly and we always enjoy our time there"}
{"text":"Good ribs and brisket. Sauce could be spicier but is not sweet. Sweet is also offered for those who don't  know any better.  Potato salad is different but tasty. Sides are plentiful but priced a notch up. I think prices include tax. Nice discount for locals. Will go back much to regret of scales."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & friendly Bartender and great Food , will return. Be cool to see Rick sling drinks as Bartender"}
{"text":"Bar staff was great, bbq...not so much. Come to Kansas City for delicious BBQ.  The $10 specialty drink was in a tiny cup that was mostly ice.  Mine was $5 since it was ladies night.  Most expensive cup of ice I've ever had. Food was overpriced too.  We had gone earlier in the day and had an awesome bloody mary and couldn't wait to come back for dinner. The place was packed because Rick was there \"bartending\".  Cleared out pretty quickly...probably because their MC (Antwaun??) was obnoxious, showing everyone the gun he was carrying, making sure everyone knew he was a self proclaimed badass and dropping an excessive amount of F Bombs...buy this poor guy a thesaurus! So not classy.  Honestly thought Rick had more class than this. Funny for a minute, got old quickly.  So  disappointed...would not recommend.  I think all the 5s on here are exaggerated because they think they \"know\" Rick and are \"friends\".  He doesn't care...its obvious. Expect this place to shut down within 2 years."}
{"text":"So, this place could have been good had it not been so expensive for cold mediocre food. For 2 people we paid $45 for cold bbq that was very generic in in flavor. This place is walking distance from my place, and I don't think I will make another trip here.  On a separate note, it is really weird that almost every business that was in Pawn Plaza has since moved out. Really there is zero incentive to come back."}
{"text":"Just southern and western hospitality at its finest. Alley was the bartender who waited on us just great. The food was outstanding and the Wednesday night Comedy shows are the best. Make sure you come out and get a great meal and free live comedy."}
{"text":"I'll be honest and tell you I was more than a little skeptical when I found this place on yelp and reading the reviews. I mean what does a guy who has a successful pawn shop and tv show know about BBQ? Evidently quite a lot because it's freaking awesome. I've eaten BBQ in every BBQ state. North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri, you name it it I've had it. I consider myself well acquainted with the subject. Surprised and very satisfied with this BBQ  We ordered the Pit Special, chopped brisket, beef hot links, ribs, chicken and pulled pork. I generally don't care for chopping brisket but it was still very good. The pulled pork was excellent, some of the best I've ever had. The ribs phenomenal, beef hot links are super tasty and a nice little heat and spice. If I had one issue, The chicken was a little dry. The sides are great too. Smoked Mac and cheese, da bomb. The baked beans are great.  Props to Rick and the staff for putting out a great product."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite barbecue place in Las Vegas. This sauces they have here are always my favorite. If you like spicy the spicy is pretty up there! If you live on visit Las Vegas make sure you come here and eat."}
{"text":"This is one of my best bbq joints in Las Vegas. The food is fresh and never frozen; at least I don't think. The staff also seems friendly and ready to help and answer any questions you may have."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food, the service,  and the patio on a beautiful Vegas day.  You have to try the smoked macaroni & cheese, OMG good!  The recommendation from the staff of the \"Spotter\" a mashed potato, burnt ends, BBQ sauce, cheese, and pork rinds put in the broiler to melt the cheese was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Great service and great atmosphere. Bartender was quick with a joke and a light for my smoke."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos!!! Great staff rick is coming in to bar tend soon!! Will be back a lot new hot spot"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas!  Thanks for appreciating the locals!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and service! You can order the delicious bbq at the bar while enjoying their absolutely free comedy shows every Wednesday at 8pm!"}
{"text":"I have been living in the area for a year now and always meant to try this place out but given im not big on crowds I was reluctant. Finally I put that asside and gave this place a try and LAWD FORGIVE ME!!!IT WAS BOMB!!! The pulled pork was juicy (like it should be) and the brisket was from the Gods. At first I was in edge because of the prices but after seeing the healthy portions it all became clear to me. If you want quality and quantity mix then this is the place to satisfy that...now I'm sitting in my car crying because the brisket is gone."}
{"text":"- Good environment - I like the space - Friendly staff - The BBQ (I had the brisket) was ok.  Nothing special.  Just lacked a lot of flavor - The BBQ sauce was pretty boring as well.  Too runny and I only tasted the sweet.  No smoke - The pork rinds tasted like they came straight out of a bag - The nachos were really good"}
{"text":"Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern (what a mouthful!) is a cute bar that serves pretty good lookin' food!  It's owned by Rick Harrison, one of the owners of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop across the parking lot and star of the tv show Pawn Stars.  We learned Rick was going to be bartending one night while we were in Vegas so we headed to the bar hoping to meet him (and get a book signed).  We saw him (and his bodyguard) head up the stairs to the bar right on time at 8pm.  We headed up afterward and found a seat at the bar.  There's also a few tables around the bar and outside on a veranda - but it's a pretty small establishment.  Rick was behind the bar pouring himself shots!  He looked a little nervous and out of his element, which I found endearing.  He made conversation with people at the bar and when I asked him for Long Island Ice Teas - he deferred to the real bartender, lol!  Our drinks were strong, no joke!  I did see him pouring some beers for other customers though.  One of the servers walked around with merchandise like hats and shirts which Rick would sign if you bought.  He did come over and sign the book but after we were there for about 30 minutes, it started to get pretty packed and he was being approached for photos and the like.  We accomplished what we came for so we relinquished our bar seats and headed to our next stop.  I did see some baked potatoes being served that were giant and completely legit!  They advertise on a sign outside when Rick is bartending and you can also ask at the pawn shop!"}
{"text":"Would have loved to try this bbq. Smelled amazing looked amazing. There was 4 people behind the counter. Slow is not the word. 4 people in front of us and took 20 minutes to get to the front of the line. Horrible. The reason not 1 star is due to the one guy in the back who was friendly and talkative at the cash register. Good guy horrible service and sad because really wanted to try the BBQ."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went here twice in a weekend. They will also let you sample the meat if you're not too sure on what to order. The ribs and potato salad are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Really hard to find good BBQ in Las Vegas but ive gotta say i will be sending friends to Ricks Rollin Smoke. I had the pulled chicken sandwich and it was very flavorful and tender. I added the sweet bbq sauce on top and even though it did have sweet notes, the sauce had a little kick to it (which was nice but if you have a sensitive stomach maybe skip on the sauce). For my side i had the smoked mac n cheese, which also had a little spice to it but not too much, i also got hints of what tasted like gravy in it ...that was a interesting but great flavor! The bf tried the 1/2 smoked chicken and ate every bit,juicy, tender and had a nice smoked flavor were his words while eating. The service from the staff was outstanding, chef cory was very informative and friendly!"}
{"text":"Today I get to experience some of the best barbecue in town. Located downtown Las Vegas right next to the world-famous pawn stars I came across one of the best places ever. The burnt ends are amazing..The mac & cheese is to die for so happy to have come across this place ..can't wait to bring the wife back here for dinner  The bartending staff was amazing definitely going to become a regular here . I will be writing another review once I try a lot more the food on the menu..my recommendations are the ribs burnt ends and finger licking chicken I'm out the door now so when I said to do it"}
{"text":"From out of town looking for a place to serve BBQ like home and this place hit the spot!!! Food, atmosphere and service all top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent bbq nachos and right next to the pawn shop! Great patio and bar area! The bartenders were really interactive with the customers and were really knowledgeable about the pawn shop owners as well as the area."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cincinnati Ohio and just had to check out the Famous Pawn Stars Place. Discovered Rick Harrison opened up a BBQ joint right next door. We already ate, so we didn't try the food. Decided to go for a beverage at the upstairs tavern to check it out. So glad we did. First impression Awsome rustic décor We were greeted immediately and promply served. Kelli was tending bar and let me just say... SHE ROCKS!!! And not being much of a gambler myself I liked there wasn't video poker and slots everywhere.The place had the inviting atmosphere of a local neighborhood hang out back home.We stayed for while and had a blast, met some great people.. Will be going back to try the food before heading back home.. Stay tuned for that review."}
{"text":"The people are are so welcoming and sweet! The food is delicious! Exactly what we've been looking for! Delicious real BBQ. It is pretty cold inside so bring a sweater but there are tables outside and it's definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Thought s place was gonna be some touristy kind of place..... I was mistaken in the best way... Good was amazing if you are visiting the pawn shop or not doesn't matter it's worth the trip"}
{"text":"Has a cute bar. The servers/bartenders are very nice and helpful. The music is all over which is nice for a group. :)"}
{"text":"Tourist TRAP! So very disappointed! $80 to feed my wife & kids \"small\" pulled pork sandwiches. $20 per serving of basic BBQ pulled pork and a small side with a pop. 1st two bites of mine was nothing but FAT! I told them such as well. They offered me more meat but I declined. Sides were very small but that didn't matter since they didn't taste so good. The cole slaw was ok, the potato salad was boring and the mac & cheese was so-so. The buns used for the sandwiches were not much bigger than a hot dog bun. They were also just starting to get stale."}
{"text":"These guys and this place are awesome.  The food is always delcious.  The brisket sandwich was amazing.  Ribs were killer.  Just enough smoke flavor with out masking the flavor of the meat.  As a beer guy, they have a huge selection for any palate.  Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!! My husband and I wanted to go to the original Rollin Smoke but they were closed today (Sunday) so we came here. Bad choice! We order the sliders and redneck nachos (because we like trying new stuff). The sliders (just two) were supposed to be brisket but they were full of fat!! My husband loves fat so he was ok with it but it literally had two chunks of meat/fat in each and were incredibly small for $11. The redneck nachos (pictured) were incredibly small as well for $11 I expected them to be a decent size. We are not on the strip there is no reason to be gouged for less than mediocre food. I love food! I LOVE BBQ but I will NEVER EVER EVER be back, this place is a waste of your time. I will say that I did like their $2 surprise shot. That is not enough to keep me satisfied. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time go to the original or go to Lucille's instead."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that good. I paid 20$ for a brisket sandwich combo which was pretty expensive."}
{"text":"The food is good but really overpriced. The reason I'm writing this review is because they have a guy that works there. (White guy, talks with a lisp, and has some real ugly tats on his arms. He made the experience inside uncomfortable for us. Saying things in a rude way. For example he said the menu is here on the glass. Some of my family where still looking on there menu board. He literally yelled \" don't look up there i already said this is our menu here on the glass. If I was a graphic designer I would change it. Boy if you were a graphic designer you wouldn't be make 8$ an hour serving tourists overpriced BBQ. The reason they don't want you looking at the original menu board is because they show how much they raised the prices on everything. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the big Hispanic guy from Wilmington Ca was really cool."}
{"text":"I had to fight the flies in the place for my food? The price is high for what you get. Another \" been there and done that\" experience.   Gr to the point that I rushed it too because the flies were driving me nuts.  Well, they took care of the fly situation. Not really into the BBQ but it's not a bad place to hang out in. Drink prices are reasonable and it's not overcrowded."}
{"text":"My son talked me in to going here, great call by him. I thought that the portions were kinda skimpy, but it actually fed three of us and filled us up. No complaints there. Great food, way better than Famous Dave's. Have been back already and loved it."}
{"text":"Food: my hubs had the ribs and really enjoyed them. The potatoes in the potato salad were under cooked and it was somewhat dry. The chicken tacos came with pico de gallo and a little bit of sour cream, but they were packed with flavor. This is strictly a meat shop, with minimal options. There were no options to mix and match meats. It's either ribs or chicken, can't do both. Everything is a la cart.  Drinks: We didn't have drinks, but there were several beer options, cans and on tap.  Ambience: The restaurant is up top and has an outside patio with several tv's for entertainment. They kitchen sends the food up a shoot.   Staff: Everyone is friendly. The bartender is befit aria which I thought was funny.  Parking: Parking lot and street parking   Overall Experience: A nice place to try, I would go back if my hubs wanted to go and I would recommend going if you like bbq. 4/5"}
{"text":"Wow! From AZ and had to check out the home of Pawn Stars. The Smokey BBQ smell drew us in and we found our way to the Tavern level. Love the atmosphere, decor, AWESOME bartender. The food is FABULOUS all the way around. Ordered The Pit Combination which was PERFECT to share - 5 of their smoked meats AND 3 sides - got their house salad (best toppings super yummy mixed greens) smoked mac & cheese and house made pig skins.  There are plenty of BBQ sauce choices and all are fantastic too."}
{"text":"Not very good. Kinda a fake BBQ joint. Sweet tea was out of a \"gold peak dispenser\". Meat was served ice cold. I got the beef brisket and pulled pork. Beef brisket was chopped so fine it had the consistency of canned dog food. Once again the meat was ice cold like it came out of the freezer. I watched the server scoop it out of a container that should have been hot. Real Pulled pork would be pulled when you ordered it not pulled hours before and stuck in the fridge to be reheated later. It was ice cold. It was expensive. I had a local discount. Two meals with drinks were $32 with the discount. $40 for non locals. Coleslaw was good. BBQ was just not quality or authentic in any way. Rick likes to call in a expert on his pawn star show all the time. He should call in a BBQ expert to show him how to do BBQ the right way. I have tasted BBQ all over this country. I would not return to this joint o recommend it. I should have known better when there were no customers in the place. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"HOT GARBAGE!!!! We stopped in here and I got the Saturday special 2 tacos and a 3oz side.  I got brisket tacos and this was hot garbage the brisket was oily and flavorless the flavor came from the Chipotle sause and cheddar cheese.  Don't waste your money like we did! REFUND PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Mediocre BBQ in a painfully suburban-feeling courtyard riddled with pandering for the Pawn Star fans.   The ribs are better than the brisket, which is better than the pulled pork, but that doesn't mean any of it is good. It's kind of Texas style, except for that they use green onions and there's no jalapeño. The mac and slaw are okay, but neither is quite southern (and who put corn in my slaw?)   I suppose the regional BBQ clusterf*ck in a place afflicted by its own cultural malaise makes sense, but take a hint from the strip and just pick a theme, y'all (outside of reality TV about second-hand resale.)"}
{"text":"Seriously the best bbq meat I have had! We went on a day when no one was there so we're concerned before we ordered. But boy were we wrong! Soooo good! I got the pulled pork and brisket plate with coleslaw. Everything was tasty. The Mac and cheese was amazing, and super flavorful. The two gentlemen working were super friendly and talkative. I highly recommend this joint as a stop for lunch, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came in on a chilly Sunday night in November looking for nothing more than to check out the new container park-like shopping/eating plaza that popped up next to Gold and Silver Pawn Shop.  Started at poutine place downstairs but wasn't interested in sitting outside and wanted a bar to go with my gravy smothered fries. Turns out the place is totally cooperative- guy at poutine place told us it was fine to take his food upstairs to the BBQ place/bar.   The place was totally dead in a way that plagues any outdoor mall on a cold Vegas night. We were the only bar patrons aside from the security guy from the pawn shop. This afforded us a private (pretty much) bartender who was super chatty and personable and told us that locals get 20% off (hello!). He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer.   Things to consider- BBQ was good and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't smothered in sauce, one of rare times where brisket outdid the rib tips in flavor. Awesome brisket, great job, guys, usually brisket falls short when compared to rib tips because fat is delicious. This is the only time I have been to a BBQ spot where brisket was as delicate and flavorful as this. That said, rib tips reminded me of a pot roast. I truly think it's because meat wasn't very fatty- quality- just a bit off from what I'm used to with rib tips.   Beer- it's almost impossible to find a bar that has s good selection of hef on tap that isn't fruit/vanilla flavored. For the love of God, hef lovers like me just want a plain delicious full bodied hef that doesn't taste like a syrup.   Lastly- it wasn't a whole lot of food for $20. Don't come in here expecting to fill up and then some.  It's good, it's pretty cool, just isn't the best value."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. Its really cool to see Rick from Pawn Stars here tonight. The best part was the event we had here for yelp and  try all the great food drom the surrounding business."}
{"text":"I am from Memphis Tenn and I love my barbecue. This place was fantastic!!! After the nice man in the kitchen suggested the Mac and cheese I turned it down but I taste my husbands and quickly decided I better get my own. This is a great place the staff is extra friendly. I will definitely be back more than likely before I leave."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service at the bar. Michael at the bar needs a raise. He's very friendly."}
{"text":"Not Impressed at ALL! I didn't even take a picture that should tell you how displeased we were I had the 3 bone stl ribs too much fat and fyi I am from Kansas City home of Great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Went into the barbecue restaurant on the first floor for dinner. Had the platter that included smoked chicken, brisket (ordered it sliced), ribs, hot links and three sides.  The portions were large as was the price: $35.00, but I wanted to sample what they had to offer since barbecue is one of my favorites.  The chicken was OK, but lacked a lot of smoked flavor.  The brisket was juicy and cooked perfectly but had virtually no smoked flavor at all.  The hot likes were just OK.  Probably the best meats were the ribs, although they were far from the best I have had.  The sides, collard greens, cold slaw, and potato salad were about average.  All in all, the barbecue was OK, but pricey.  And $5.00 for a fountain soda?    After dinner we went upstairs to the tavern were Rick was tending bar with Antoine from Pawn Stars as the MC.  They also had a DJ in the tavern.  Interestingly enough, the drink prices were better than the food prices.  A nice feature of the tavern was that you could order off the menu of the barbecue restaurant.  The tavern had a nice beer selection, and Rick and Antoine certainly put on a show at the tavern. As it turns out, Antoine can be quite the comedian.  Who knew?"}
{"text":"Had the smoked brisket sandwich and bbq baked beans. The beans were awesome,  the brisket wasn't full of flavor. The bark on the brisket was decent, but the meat didn't have much taste outside the sauce. Those beans tho!!!   Spent $20 for my meal, which was about par with other single meals I've eaten during the week. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to patronize the business owned by the pawn stars. If that is the case, eat at the old fashioned burgers next door."}
{"text":"OMG Kelli is the best! We had a wedding ceremony tonight and this place was the best after party I could imagine. She made us feel at home and really gave us the best night ever! Xoxo"}
{"text":"The meat was great but the potatoes tasted like instant mashed. They were out of Mac n cheese at 6pm. Service was AWFUL. Getting refills was impossible."}
{"text":"As I walked in there was no one in the place and the woman at the counter was asking personal questions that only an illbred and illiterate person would ask. I told her to mind her manners. The small draft beer is 7 dollars! Total rip off. The food was half way decent. I will never go back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow! Very good brisket! A bit pricey, but very good food."}
{"text":"$5 for a soda. Can't really respect an owner that rips people off.  Food was good but not any better than Lucille's or Dickeys."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great service! Good drinks! Would definitely come back here! Make sure you stop by when your in Vegas really chill place.!"}
