{"text":"Looked this place up on here hoping to find a diner worth coming to. I give it a low rating because from the start it wasn't good. The young boy & woman servers were rude & had a vibe that we didn't appreciate. When I go somewhere I want to feel welcomed. 

Our server had an attitude as if she didn't want to be there waiting on us. I had the Philly cheese steak & my mother had the American Burger. My sandwich had more onion and peppers then meat. When I want a Philly Cheese Steak I want to to have some steak, not a bun overstuffed with onions & peppers. My plate was messy, as soon as he put it down everything started falling off onto the table. 

My mother was not even a bite into her sandwich when it all started falling apart. The bread seemed to be old and dried out, it kept crumbling up and everything fell out. She stopped eating after that, and when she asked to get it taken off the bill since she barely had anything to eat, our server gave off that negative vibe again. 

Finally as we were leaving, we were getting ready to pay and our server told the young boy to check us out, she told him to take off my moms food and he just gave us this look and rolled his eyes. We asked for military discount which was nice that they had since places never seem to do it anymore. I still don't understand how my philly steak & an ice tea came out to $22. By then we were just over this place and wanted to leave. This place was dirty & just a negative vibe from the start. Never coming here again.  

Please don't waste your time."}
{"text":"It wasn't the greatest food. They fried the onion rings with the fish. The prices was way too high."}
{"text":"When we lived in Chandler, Chase's was our regular Sunday breakfast stop. Haven't been here in years, but the fact that I can still recognize their wait staff speaks to just how \"family owned\" this place is. It's the kind of place people like to work and I've always enjoyed eating. Breakfast prices have gone up, but still reliable as great comfort food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The waffles are killer. Great coffee. Always love the service. My wife and I go regularly."}
{"text":"What can I say that has not already been said? Chase's has great service, good food for a great price and offers a LOT of choices. This is no Denny's or IHOP. The food quality is much better, the inside is much more hip and clean and they even offer homemade desserts at the counter. I like going because I can pick a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Love the variety."}
{"text":"I Love Diners!! And this place is awesome, it's cute and the people are great!! Big portions for breakfast!! Food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Placed a order to go.  Very friendly over the phone.  I ordered a Dre Patty melt with onion rings and it was very good! For to people it was $30..."}
{"text":"This is my go to for breakfast in Phoenix! I always order the hot wings as an appetizer too... They are big meaty wings. I'm not sure what makes them so good but I order them almost every time I go, and I'm a self-proclaimed wing connoisseur. I've ordered just about every different breakfast option, including a burrito nearly the size of my head! Everything is good, trust me!The owners are always around, the whole family works there, which is another reason I go... Gotta support locally owned and operated! I always get great service, even my boyfriend who is the pickiest-eater-ever always gets his food out right. My boyfriend loves the club, its made with actual chicken breast and carved turkey, not just cold cuts.  I don't have a single complaint. And make sure not to leave without dessert... It's homemade and delicious. My favorites are the German chocolate and carrot cake, but I'm looking forward to trying the chocolate coconut creme pie one of these days! If you go with a group, try the superstition (a huge breakfast option made to be shared), it'll be fun!"}
{"text":"We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Chase's for breakfast. The omelets are really tasty, the service is always great, and the vibe is casual and laid back. A favorite."}
{"text":"The food was good, I had a french toast combo, hubby a Belgian waffle & kids had pancakes. The diner was cute. The service was amazing. Food came out fast. To feed a family of 4, A meal and drink for each cost us 28$ for a sit down restaurant. Not bad. It's worth checking out for yourself."}
{"text":"Best bfast place going.  Been coming here weekly for 7 years. Best value with weekday bfast special. Buy the coffee cup."}
{"text":"I can't find full breakfast menu online so I don't know the name of the breakfast burrito I ordered. Well I have lived in 10 states and 3 Countries and the breakfast burrito I ordered was the worst breakfast item I have ever had. Suppose to be spicy, I guess when they pour a bottle of some kind of spice on it they think it's spicy. Yes it was big and full of potatoes and potatoes and more potatoes, the egg was at one end with little cheese. First 1/3 of burrito was potatoes no egg no cheese. Other breakfast items are good but waitress and menu hiped up burrito which SUCKED."}
{"text":"The food is excellent if I could add more than 5 stars I would! It is very decently priced for a restaurant :) Great 50's style and with mini jukeboxes in your booth tat actually work."}
{"text":"So we were heading to a movie and wanted to stop and get food. We live In the area and have always wanted to try this place. Well, I am so glad we did! I got breakfast and my husband got lunch. I thought the prices were a little high at first, but when you see the food it's totally reasonable! I got a breakfast platter with sunny side up eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. Everything was perfectly cooked. Hasbrowns were crispy amd delicious.  My husband got a blt. It had probably a little under a pound of crispy bacon, it was delicious. He could not even finish it. We can't wait to go back and try more!!!"}
{"text":"Awsome first experience! We had breakfast at Chase's Diner for the first time yesterday. The service was exceptional! Thank you, Jen. The food was great! I had the French Toast with eggs and sausage and the misses had the Green Chile Breakfast Skillet. Mine was perfect. The misses raved about the Green Chile so I tried some of hers and it was delicious. 

We have found our new breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick weekday breakfast while running errands.  
Staff= friendly. 
Service= quick & pleasant. 
Food= better than expected. French Dip, Standard Cheeseburger and Green Chile cheeseburger all delivered.  
Place could use an update and even a good cleaning on the windows and walls but it wasn't gross or anything."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but good food and huge portions. Enough for today and take home for another meal tomorrow"}
{"text":"In the commercial chain driven world that the Phoenix valley seems to be, it is always a welcome surprise to find a local family owned joint that fully lives up to the \"diner\" moniker.  

The atmosphere here was pretty good and the food was great.  They seem to specialize in \"American comfort food\" and have a huge menu that made it tough to decided.  And better still, we had a little impromptu conversation with the owner who also recommended some other great locally owned places.  

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A breakfast favorite! Friendly service and great food!"}
{"text":"My guy and I wanted to eat at a Japanese restaurant but was closed on Sundays.  We settled with Chase's Diner because it was near by and open.  

Our waitress (can't remember her name...Lauren maybe?) was extremely polite and gave great customer service.  There were a few problems with our visit.  My guy and I thought their prices were a little overpriced for what kind of food it was.  Grilled cheese for $13?  It wasn't tasty or high quality.  Second, my chicken was ice cold in the center.  I sent my food back to have it remade.  As we waited, my date had a shocked look on his face.  He mouthed out to me there was a cricket crawling on the back of my seat.  I turned around and saw it was inches away from me.  I quickly ordered my food to-go because I didn't want to be at such an awful place.  Our waitress didn't charge us for my dish and we went on our way.  

I noticed they didn't give me any of my sides.  I went home hungry and I probably will never go back to Chase's Diner.  Lauren, you are too good for that place.  I hope you find a better place to work at where your work ethics at appreciated!"}
{"text":"This hit the spot for a little hang over cure. It's a lot like 5&Diner.  The wait staff is your typical teenybopper crew. I vote for the home fries over the hashbrowns.

I found this coupon after we got back, not a bad deal:

{"text":"The owners are regulars at my work. They are wonderful people! One time they brought in slices of their chocolate cake and carrot cake, both were AMAZING! My favorite would have to be their carrot cake-it was so moist and flavorful!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to come to.  We accidentally found it last Thursday. Misty waited on us and was so sweet! Had to come back 5 days later.  Purposely drove 20 minutes to come. Jamie was our waitress. (One of the owner's daughters.) Beautiful smile and by the time we left, we felt like family!  :-). We are moving to the area next month and have definately found \"our\" place!! Their portions are enough for leftovers later and their prices will definitely not break the bank!!   Thank you for a relaxed, happy setting for a good meal and a great smile to end our busy day."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place several times but just never had the inclination to try it out.  Well, last Friday some unusual events transpired in our life and the next thing you know, we were seated in a booth at Chase's Diner for dinner.....meaning, I wouldn't have chosen to go there under normal circumstances.  

I regret not having eaten here before.  The food was very good and our waitress was attentive and such a sweetheart.  It's a down- home, comfort food kinda place.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My bf prefers home cooked meals and he said that when he can't get me to cook him a home cooked meal, he wouldn't mind so much if we could eat here at Chase's because their food is like home cooked. 

What we ordered:  
* fried zuchini-- comes in sticks and not coins.  crunchy and firm...not soggy or mushy.  very good. 
* meatloaf--  Delicious and a BIG portion.  I had to take home leftovers because I just couldn't finish it all off.  This tasted home made....so good!
* green beans --  almost like my mom's.  Cooked with bacon and onions, but Chase's has a kick to it.  I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is, but it was a bit spicy.....which I love.
* pulled pork sandwich-- my bf went on and on about this.  It's served with cole slaw and he put some cole slaw in the sandwich and said it was great.  

Food was delicious, portions were generous and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"High praise for an exceptional establishment. My compliments to the chef for all the great meals I have had the pleasure to enjoy, and cheers to the top notch service from a very friendly staff. An extra air high 5 to the awesome waitress who was kind enough to bring me my order while I waited outside with my pup. You guys rock"}
{"text":"First time there this morning. Was definitely a better experience and a lot better food than Hoosier Cafe down the road. The waitress was super friendly and filled up my coffee religiously ha. I'll be going back here for more breakfast for sure!"}
{"text":"Chases Diner is really so cute, a blast from the past of Americana.  However, I wish it had been cleaner.  Everything was a bit sticky and grimy, which was off putting.   The food was only barely passable, very bland and not worth another visit."}
{"text":"Today was my second and last time I dine here. Both times the restaurant was 1/3 full and we waited 35 minutes or more from ordering to getting our breakfast.   Food seems overpriced for the average taste and competition in the area."}
{"text":"Great food - generous portions. Hollandaise needs work but best poached eggs I've had. Spinach omelet a favorite and the home fries are excellent!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Traditional diner breakfast done very well ! So good and delicious. The service was amazing and friendly."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for over 5 years, thinking it was too expensive for family food.  The exterior is a glitzy facade, so I expected yuppies to live there, and it wouldn't be a place for family grub.  I was SO wrong.

On a whim, I took my college-sophomore daughter to breakfast here while we waited for the college bookstore to open.  The meals we ordered had so much food, that we ended up taking it home before we went back to the bookstore.  

This experience was even so good, that we took the rest of our family on the next weekend outing.  Everyone enjoyed everything they tried, and each of us is excited to go back and try the Plan B items we didn't get to try the first time.  Now for the Big 3:

Price:  Average.  $6-10 for each entree, and count on drinks, malts, shakes costing an extra $4-5.

Service:  Mostly available.  The waitresses are super-busy, so you may have times where they haven't refilled drinks for 3-5 minutes.  Maybe I should drink slower.

Taste:  Every item tasted perfect.  The biscuits-and-gravy were enjoyed by all at our table, and I had ordered the meatloaf, which was absolutely wonderful.  I will be conflicted on my next visit, since I KNOW the meatloaf is good, but I'd also like to try several other items.  I'm sure that everyone in your party will find something they'll like.

Long live family businesses!"}
{"text":"Went here with my Brunchfest club cause we heard he portions were huge and cheap. Got there on a Saturday morning around 10am and only waited 10 minutes for a seat of four. We ordered drinks and then food which came out quick and delicious. I got the huge chicken fried steak with hash browns and scrambled eggs with cheese. 

It was so mouth watering and filling and delish. I have to come back cause my friends waffles and pancakes with bacon looked so good. 

If you are looking for great diner food and a great atmosphere then look no further. Only bad thing is my water had no lemon. Why? My water loves lemons."}
{"text":"Great milkshakes, atmosphere, and bacon. The waitress was a sweetheart as well! Adore this diner dearly and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was good. Wait staff was a little slow. The jukebox was icky and things were generally unclean."}
{"text":"It's a classic American diner with all of the atmosphere and food that diner lovers expect.  The food also happens to be particularly good -- it's clear that they prepare most of their food in house.  When I'm in the mood to go all out, I order their chicken-fried steak and eggs.  It's a good idea to update your life insurance policy before ordering it, but it's worth every crispy, savory bite."}
{"text":"French toasty toast is amazing. Great retro feel that makes for an amazing breakfast spot. My fiancé and I come here at least once a week and we always leave with full bellies and smiles on our face. Love this place."}
{"text":"Dont order the corned beef hash.  It looks like it came straight out of the can. $10 for slop coming out a $2 can.  Try a little harder, Chase."}
{"text":"Rude!  Mediocre food, no refills on lemonade that cost $3.50 a glass plus they were very rude to my 12 year old daughter. 12 year old can order off the kids menu with a free drink. They charged her $3.50 for her drink because they did not believe she was 12. We are tall people. Big jerks!!!"}
{"text":"had my pork chop here, overcook, dry and does not taste good. service is good."}
{"text":"Chase is your basic diner done okay, food is actually not bad, I have only tried it once and for breakfast, but I can see the quality of the food is average. For the food itself it would deserve a 3 star for being average, nothing great but nothing poor either. What I would dock a star is for  the portion size and price. It is a little high for the food that you get and the portion are kind of small, I had 2 \"large\" scrambled eggs, but large is highly questionable here. Side of hash browns are very small for 2.50 but I notice other diners and cafe tend to try and do this to make a little more money on side items, which is why I never recommend anyone order things on the side. Their positives are they look to have a great deal on weekdays, which I will try out sometime in the future but it is just the one deal. The other positive that I find is that they open early which is convenient for me."}
{"text":"This is my family favorite breakfast/brunch place! We have been coming here for years after sporting events, lazy Saturday or Sunday mornings!  The atmosphere is classic diner and the staff is like one big family. The service is impeccable and heart felt! 

Now the food is exactly what you would hope for and more. I have had most of the menu and have never been disappointed. Do you your family and friends a favor and come eat here for breakfast,lunch or dinner!

Oh yeah and according to my wife the best biscuits n gravy other than her Mom's. Spoken from a girls who has a sign in are house \"I love you more than biscuits and gravy\"."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff great food timely manner. I won't go to any other Diner. This is coming from a breakfast fan."}
{"text":"Go to place to eat they treat you like family they give you good food good value and it's just a pleasing atmosphere I highly recommend it go they'll talk to you they don't act like you're hurry up and get them out of there"}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Diner for years now. Thought I'd finally give it a review.

First, of all, it is a 50's Diner, if you don't like that, then don't go. They play 50's music, they have a jukebox, they have red seats, and diner tables. From the outside, they LOOK like a old time diner too. Pictures of Elvis, and other celebrities from the 50's. The real deal.

My favorite thing to get is the abundant Chicken Fried Steak, with mashed potatoes, and Fried Okra. Usually I have to take it home, but on occasion I have been known to chow down on it.

This time I wanted something different. When I am not ordering my usual CFS dinner, I typically go for the meatloaf dinner, which is almost as good. Well, this time I wanted something different. Every page on the menu, that I went to I found something that looked great. So to make a long story short, the waitress came over to take our order. Ellen said she was ready, but I said I couldn't make up my mind yet, as there were too many choices. The waitress replied, \"That's OK, we're open til 9!\". I burst out laughing. It was so funny!

Anyway, after a few minutes, I finally ordered the Polish sausage and roasted vegetables hoagie. It was absolutely great.

You never know. You go to a restaurant for years, and it surprises you with something else delicious.

This place is 20 miles away from where we live, but we go there anyway.

This place is the best in the Valley. Just go to it."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast great service. Boy do I like ordering a grilled ham and cheese to go for work."}
{"text":"Best version of a patty melt every! Naughty food super cheap. They had about a dozen shake flavors, banana was amazing. One is plenty for 2 to share. Service was excellent. Cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak, eggs, hash browns, sourdough toast: Simple and ridiculously good.  The biscuits and gravy also rock, as does the vanilla milkshake.  Their sausage gravy has massive pieces of sausage in it.  I have seen their prices climb and the size of the chicken fried steak shrink, but it's still a good price for a really good, calorie-busting meal.  

I've only had (really) bad service here once, and I didn't see the guy/waiter any time after that.

Why it's not a 5: For some reason it's always really cold inside here, which makes good like hash browns come to the table less than piping hot...and sometimes the noise level really climbs up with large (or just loud) families."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A REAL DINER IN ARIZONA! Steak and eggs done perfectly, with condiments in NORMAL bottles on every table. Waitress only too happy to get me some hot brown gravy for french fries free of charge. Just like NYC and NJ! Can't wait to go back. Only negative is they close at 9pm weeknights, 10pm weekends."}
{"text":"Recently had a double date to brunch here and I'm a fan! The menu had a lot of options for us and the food was really tasty. What I really liked about Chase's Diner is how the waitress and chef accommodated my friend who has a gluten-free diet. Most diners I've been to haven't had such a friendly and accommodating staff. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came for our Sons 11th birthday. Food was good, came out quickly and was hot. The prices are good and the atmosphere is pretty cool. They even gave our son a fudge sundae for free!  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for as long as I can remember. It is always clean, service is always friendly and prompt, and the food has yet to disappoint! It can be busier on the weekends, but I have never waited more than 20 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst breakfast experience I've had in the Chandler area. Service was slow , The food was cold , It took 45 minutes to get a cup of coffee. Would not recommend this place to anyone ever. It might have been easier to deal with if I had gotten an apology or some kind of recognition about what was going on.We had to go and ask for utensils.All this in a half empty restaurant.I hope this saves at least one person from an experience as bad  as I had."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service!! I go here often and I have yet to be disappointed. They also have huge portion sizes so you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The menu is huge and everything is good. My family likes the breakfast food best. The stand out items are: Andre's green chili sauce, French toast, French dip, and best carrot cake."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was amazing, and the overall vibe is wonderful. I personally found the pancakes and French toast a billion times better than IHOP. Too bad it's not open 24/7 or else I would be there every night!"}
{"text":"Was hoping that this place would serve up some good basics, but ended up with some of the most bland food I've ever eaten at a restaurant. Came in on a Saturday around 8:00am because my wife was craving chicken fried steak and had seen it recommended here. I also ordered a philly steak omelette and a half order of biscuits and gravy. Best parts of the meal were the two styles of potatoes (home fries and hash browns) and the toast. The chicken fried steak, while big, had no flavor in the batter or on the steak. The omelette was a decent size with some big chunks of shaved ribeye but had no flavor. The biscuits and gravy had good consistency and a lot of sausage chunks, but (you guessed it) had no flavor. Everything was in severe need of salt or some other seasoning. The curious thing is that the home fries actually were seasoned well (hence them being one of the best parts of the meal). Nice people and service was prompt, but the food was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing! The gentlemen who served us were so friendly and made sure all our needs were met! Our glasses were never empty, our food was amazing and the atmosphere was stupendous! I can't wait to go back! The prices were a bit high but for good food I can't complain! I will be recommending this place to all my family and friends!"}
{"text":"**update***
So breakfast is better.  I had bacon, eggs, and pancakes.  All were good.  I stand by my statement about the music, and service was good but slow.  I wouldn't try to eat here if I was in a hurry to get someplace else! ****
I might come back for breakfast, but I don't know if I can cope with the 1950's music in the a.m.  I hate 1950's music.  Hate it.  I'm not going to complain about it here though because I'm the one who chose to eat at the 50's style diner.  I'd have been shocked to hear anything else.  I am going to verbalize some complaints about the food, though.  My burger was a real burger and it was more than enough size-wise, but there were no spices in the thing.  Like they didn't even sprinkle a little salt.  Nada.  It was super greasy, so you'd think it would have had a little bit of flavor there.  No.  My cheese and green chilies were flavorful and generously applied, but generous toppings couldn't hide the Styrofoam underneath.  My fries were pretty good, once I put salt on them.  I'm totally OK with salting my own fries, that works.  It wouldn't do any good on the burger, but that's because it really needs to be seasoned before or at least during the cooking process.  Anyway, service was good and the place was clean.  I just don't foresee another burger here in my future, I'll update on breakfast if that happens."}
{"text":"Great Food - Great Service. Loved the ambiance felt like 50's environment including working jukebox playing 50-60's music. They definitely earned or business in the future!"}
{"text":"Had the carrot cake....huge and delicious....I'll be back! 
Originally a friend bought me a slice, and I just had to go back and buy my own."}
{"text":"Doing a road trip with my husband across the United States and have to say we had the best breakfast here. Very simple two eggs with home fries, bacon and toast. Everything had so much flavor we had to come back the next day."}
{"text":"Great diner food!
Went for breakfast and had chicken fried steak with eggs over easy,
WOW it was friggin awesome.Good service too."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Has a really cool atmosphere, great staff and portion sizes that all Americans can agree on. My wife called for a banana split to go which I don't believe is standard but they accommodated the request without hesitation."}
{"text":"Typical 50'5 style diner fare.

The food is good, the wait staff is always friendly.

Kids menu items are only $.99, excluding drinks.  So if you really want to save some dough, tell your kids to just order water.

It's worth a try."}
{"text":"A real 50's diner and a classy one at that. Had a basic breakfast how yummy it was. The coffee here is fresh ground and very tasty. 
Service is very friendly, remember to tip well. The servers in this state make half of the minimum wage. Thanks Becky for a great experience !"}
{"text":"Every time I come here for breakfast I am never disappointed.  Everything is so yummy.  This is my favorite place to go for breakfast in the area & I Love the 50's diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite breakfast spots around. Their food is always served picture perfect and tastes just as amazing. I always get the Jens veggie burrito and it's packed full of delish ingredients and huge portion sizes perfect for left overs for lunch. I go with my family and everyone is constantly very pleased with their choice in food. The pecan waffles are a family favorite. Service is always great and the atmosphere is very fun, with working mini juke boxes at the booths."}
{"text":"So good! Staff is awesome and food is great. Fried zucchini is amazing yum yum yum. Everything always great!"}
{"text":"I could not wait to go when I saw pictures of the inside. The music is great. The place was moderately clean. The food was nothing to write home about. The fried food tasted like old oil was used. The burger was made with a sub-par grade of meat. We came in for dinner. I am not sure I will take the chance with breakfast."}
{"text":"This is the worse food I've ever tasted which is difficult for diner food. Wait staff was terrible also."}
{"text":"I needed a  quite place to eat lunch and finish some work with my laptop so I yelped places with Wi-Fi near me and Chase's Diner came up.  It's a nice place with a 50s theme including the booths and memorabilia.  Menu items were primarily American style cuisine so hamburgers with fries etc.  I tried the mushroom burger it was pretty good but a lil dry.  The plate was MASSIVE and I ended up taking 1/2 of it home.  Overall it was a good  experience, the Wi-Fi worked great only wished they had a little more healthy meals on the menu but I don't fault them for that since the traditional Americana foods are rarely good for your waistline."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for several years. Every time we come we've never had a bad experience. Staff is always friendly, food is delicious, service is great. Overall if I'm craving breakfast for dinner or a burger for breakfast this is the place I'd like to come."}
{"text":"Great service! I love the style and feeling of the restaurant. They sometimes have a weekly trivia question that if you answer, you get something for free next visit! The tuna melt I had was fantastic! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Exceptional breakfast! Prompt and quality cakes! Can't believe this spot kills my home spot for breakfast! Definitely will be a regular visitor here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chase's Diner 3 times now and I am so glad that I found it. They have a nice menu with a wide variety of items for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The prices are very reasonable which is always nice when you are on a tight budget but are looking for a good meal. I had the Tuna Melt the first time which was excellent and was so excited when I saw you could order tater tots as a side. The kids menu is very cheap which for those of you with families knows how much it costs to feed the kids. The service on all 3 visits was great. I will definitely be eating at Chase's Diner again soon."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since the  since the mid 90's. one of the best breakfast shops in town some of the best desserts you'll ever have if you like German chocolate cake you have to go there. a slice of cake has to be eight inches tall."}
{"text":"Great place, only down side I've seen is the red chile that is for sant fe skillet,  honestly you would probably be slapped if you served it as red chile anywhere in Santa Fe.  FYI Texas style chili and New Mexico chile are very, very different, what I saw in that chile was basically tomatoes and beans not red chile at all"}
{"text":"I am hear quite often, however, my Yelps serve no justice as I had to create a new account as I forgot my password. The little potatoes that are served aside most breakfast dishes for an additional few cents are the best. Crispy, deep fried goodness. I enjoy their staff as they are not forever changing and it is always nice to see familiar faces. Deep fried okra, awesome. Coffee, awesome. Every Sunday they have a trivia question, if you answer it correctly, you get a voucher for a free meal, double awesome!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast deals and all time great service. Prices a little higher than other diners but food quality is good."}
{"text":"It's good. Not the best, just good. The chicken fried steak could have more crunch, but I rate it a 3 out of 5. The country gravy needs pepper and has a okay flavor. Again I would give it a 3 out of 5. My husband had the chicken chili omelette and loved it! He would give it a 5 out of 5. I might come back and try something new."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch, then stay for the pie!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love going here. Never too crowded and never have to wait to be seated. We always get the Combo Breakfast special for $3.99, 2 big pancakes, beacon or sausage and 2 eggs. The coffee is great. 
If you are a fan of a 50's diner this is the place to go. 
It's a family business and I think everyone in the entire family works there.
The owner is very nice, when is is there he will come around to greet everyone."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner last week, overall the place is cool. Old school diner theme. Loved that they had a large serving of fries. I'm obsessed with fries! Their cheese sticks were not good. They had a chalky feeling to them therefore we didn't eat them. The price was decent but more on the expensive side. Only downfall is that our serve would leave us unattended for long periods of time. Our drinks would get empty or we'd need some type of condiment and we're really able to ask since he'd never come around."}
{"text":"Super amazing food and service. Best diner in town honestly, food was hot and delicious Sausage was savory and juicy. My pancakes were buttery and soft and eggs cooked to perfection. Service was polite and prompt and to top it all off its insanely affordable! Ill never eat Ihop again as long as Chase's is here!"}
{"text":"This diner is a blast from the past. They have amazing food and not too bad of prices. The atmosphere is amazing and filled with oldies. The design of the diner is very actuate and really brings you back in time. The costumer service is great and they are okay with taking pictures in the diner. Me and my friends originally only went to take pictures but then we ended up eating there and we did not regret it at all."}
{"text":"Better than an average 3 star, for sure!  It reminds me of a Johnny Rockets or a nicer 5 & Diner.  The first thing I noticed was how clean it was.  All polished stainless steel and freshly wiped down red booths.  I almost felt like I was in a circuit board clean room.

The food? Ohhhhh the food!  I split a swiss mushroom burger with the wife and I got my young one a kid's cheeseburger meal.  I really wish I would have ordered more, but the current status of our yackonomy advised me against it.

The other food coming out looked ridiculously delectable, and it was brought out with the haste of an olympic sprinter.  Who could ask for more?

I will definitely be coming back to here and recommending it to my friends.  Its well worth the 2 block drive from my house.  Did I mention they have breakfast!  I'm so there!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a new breakfast place. We have found it. The staff is top notch and the food is amazing. 

We have had breakfast, lunch and dinner there. We have yet to find anything on the menu that we don't enjoy. 

If you like dessert then you are in luck as well. Last week I had a slice of Cream Cheese Lemonade by Jen. It was an amazing slice of cheese cake."}
{"text":"It was a busy Saturday but we got seated pretty quick, like 10 mins waiting in all. The food was really good! We ordered meat lovers sampler, bacon cheeseburger, and BLT, all the food came out DELICIOUS!! We even got vanilla milkshake to go and I really like it because it wasn't too sweet, just perfect! 
Will have to find time to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh spinach omelet with buttery hashbrowns and sourdough toast for me, and my husband had Andre's Chili Caliente Skillet with chicken, home fries and homemade green Chile. Both were delicious!!! Great service and cute atmosphere.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I am way overdue on this review.  In the past 7 years we've eaten at Chase's several times.  Most usually it's either them or Hoosier Cafe for breakfast and Chase's coffee is way better than Hoosier's so lately I've been leaning towards breakfast here.

We've tried several items on the menu, and all have been delicious, but have discovered lately that the chicken fried steak is the perfect breakfast to share.  That thing is HUGE!  I can't imagine eating the entire thing myself.  A half leaves me waddling out, wishing I had my fat pants on.

The staff is friendly and I can't get over how clean the joint always is.  The only negatives I can think of is once in awhile the servers are busy chatting with each other and I've seen the meals sit and sit under the heat lamp.  Get that hot food out, then chat.  

And once in awhile we also get the wrong food, like scrambled eggs instead of over easy.  I almost never order them any other way than OE, (if you see sunny side up eggs in any of my pics, that's my Mr.'s preference) and on the last visit we ordered hash browns but got the home fries.  They were delicious.  They just don't mix up as well with the yolky goodness from the eggs.  

Overall we love Chase's Diner and will continue to come back, especially for the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times because the kids love their burgers.  I do too but I can get a good burger at a lot of other places....BUT....if you love breakfast, and you love HOT green chili...YOU MUST try their Pork Green Chili Skillet!  Flavorful, HOT, and just so yummy!  ITs a lot of food and I should have shared it with my husband because I could not finish it.  I swapped out toast for a nice warm tortilla.  Aye Dios Mio!  Staff there are so nice as well.  I would rather give this place my business than a chain any day!  Support local!"}
{"text":"Egg white omelette with ham and cheese was great. Service was awesome.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase's Diner today. Good food as well as good fries. This is one of those 50's style diners that's fun to eat at. I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated,
All Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy. 
Hilarious."}
{"text":"Place is great great loyal owner treats staff well owns a Taco Bell and a few other place.   This place has hit good food"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place when I'm in Arizona! The breakfast is second to none.  My favorite is waffles, bacon, eggs and extra well done hash browns.  It never disappoints!! If you're in the area you should definitely stop in.  It's sure to become your new favorite!!  And make sure you leave room for carrot cake! It's homemade and amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome Great food great prices great portions! I highly recommend chases diner!"}
{"text":"I honestly had very high hopes for this place it was so cute and it had a nice environment. Unfortunately our waitress was no good not only did she rush us but when I would ask her what was in the food I ordered not only did she give MAJOR attitude but she rolled her eyes at one point. I ordered an apple juice it didn't come with free refills obviously so I got another, when my check came my food came out to be the same price as the two Apple juices I had gotten! The receipt said 2 LARGE juices but my cup was about half the size of everyone else at my table. The food wasn't good either and the portions were much too small. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"This is the kind of diner I have been looking for for a LONG time! A simple diner with more than decent food. I wasnt expecting too much from this place going in since all the others I have been to are just flat out mediocre at best. 
First Impression:
Walking in the door I was acknowledged immediately with a warm and happy \"I will be right there!\"

Atmosphere: 
The place appeared very clean and seemed pretty steady before the lunch crowd. The music is 50s music to match the furniture (it appears that this used to be a 5 n diner, I could be wrong since I'm new to the area). 

Service:
Waitress: Suzie
The service is amazing! I work in customer service so I usually go through my checklist of customer service do's. 1) Happy and friendly attitude CHECK! 2) Checks in on me but not too much to the point where it's stalker-ish CHECK! 3) acknowledges when you try to get her attention CHECK And so on and so forth. 

Food:
This one is important! It's why I came here after all! The chef actually KNOWS HOW TO COOK EGGS!!! IT'S A MIRACLE! I'm SUPER picky about my eggs! Medium means medium and they NAILED it! The outside of the whites are not crisp (they shouldn't be fyi). Secondly the food is actually colorful! Food should be in brighter colors. I noticed at the tables around me, their various fried foods are cooked with a perfect golden brown color. 
In no way am I saying this place is a high class fancy restaurant but for something this simple, the chef did well (like they ALL should). 

Overall: 
I enjoy this place a LOT! I think I found my new hang out spot to run away to when I'm a little flustered with everyday life. Nothing beats a GREAT old fashioned 50s diner to escape the overwhelming modern day life."}
{"text":"After many more delicious meals here, we need to update the rating to 5 stars. The food is always fresh and delicious, service is great, prices are reasonable... and they have the BEST biscuits!!"}
{"text":"This place is cute and Charming 50's style have not had a problem the food was on point the husband enjoys the pancakes with strawberries & cream!!
I get the special 2 eggs 2 bacon 2 pancakes and 2 coffees 
(The only thing is the 1st 2 times we got charged $35) I don't know if it's because we are Hispanic but the 3rd time we ordered the same thing and got charged $ 20. That's $15 different I'M THINKING WOW!!!!! 
I don't like to complain but that's an OVER  CHARGE 
(((I don't think people should be charged more because of nationality))) 
Besides that loved the food

P.S. sorry I don't have the receipts threw them away! All I ask is that the Waitresses or waiters make sure prices are on point! Thank you :]"}
{"text":"Love Chase's! Everything we have tried we love. Eggs benedict is so yummy and the pancakes are huge, fluffy and delicious! Great friendly staff makes this diner the perfect breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Love the place , friendly staff very bright and food is amazing with decent size portions"}
{"text":"If you like a \"railcar\" feel, '50s theme, and a wonderful breakfast, then you must try Chase's Diner!

I come to AZ often and only recently stumbled upon Chase's while I was looking for a breakfast restaurant after an early morning workout! I was actually on my way to another breakfast place and drove by Chase's. The building caught my eye, and so I flipped a U and gave her a try.

They have a good breakfast menu, with many choices.  But, coming from Santa Fe, NM, my eye keyed on the green chile pork sauce - 'I've got to try that!'  I ordered a standard breakfast, because I love me some eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, etc. and got a side of the green chile to drizzle over everything - I'm in heaven...

My second visit here, i ordered eggs and bacon again (with a side a chile that never made it to the table), but also ordered their batter dipped French Toast, with pure maple syrup - ate it all and enjoyed it! Nice and crispy battered Texas toast!

The first time there the service was wonderful, food awesome, ambience fun! I would have given it a 5 star had I done this review at that time. But this second time i went, the service was not great - the food was still wonderful (green chile too!).  The place was packed and the waiter seemed like a rookie - pleasant enough and trying to keep up, but they were woefully understaffed!

The next time I'm in AZ, I'll go again and try something new on the menu...and order a side of green chile!"}
{"text":"We have made this a regular place, the price is right, and the food is good, and the wait staff are very friendly"}
{"text":"Chase's Diner made me a fast fan a couple of months ago when Mom was visiting and we stopped in for a quick dinner. The building and decor remind me of NY diners we grew up going to, the interior is clean and inviting, and service was friendly and on point. 

During our first visit, Mom and Scott chowed down on burgers they raved about, and I thoroughly enjoyed a tuna melt, taking half to-go. Food was cooked to order, delivered in a timely manner, generously portioned, and just as we'd requested. Couldn't ask for more. 

Last week, Mom asked to stop in for lunch, she, Scott, and our buddy all enjoyed burgers, and I gobbled up Brenda's bunless grilled chicken - with provolone and sautéed shrooms - with a side of tasty carrots. Our server was new and very good: I forget his name, but at 6'7\" he would be hard to miss. 

We will for sure be back, this is a place Scott used to take his Mom to often, and it took a while after she passed away for him to be comfortable revisiting; I'm glad we did. Yay, we are fans! ;)"}
{"text":"Just killin' time Sunday afternoon, drove by Chase Diner.  What excellent food!  Can't wait to go back.  Had the BBQ  brisket, pulled pork rib special.  Fantastic!  I wish I lived closer so I could go more often, but if you like real excellent diner food, Chase's Diner is the place for you!  Old fashioned excellent cuisine.  The ambiance is amazing, since I am a real 50's fan."}
{"text":"Okay,  so I read the reviews before i went to see if anyone recommended something. To say the least I ordered my breakfast and got a cup of there green chili. OH MY GOD, amazing!!!!!!!!! I have moved all over the united states and this chili will always have me coming back. The owner is so kind as well!!! The staff is very sweet. If i could live in the kitchen and eat there chili all day i would,lol, simply the best."}
{"text":"I need to give a shout out to our local diner. This is our stand by when we don't know what we want but we want something quick. We ALWAYS order fried zucchini, YUM, and a handful of waitresses know is as regulars and usually only need to confirm our drink orders. The breakfast is great, the burgers are just the way a burger should be and they have good pie too. It's not often we are disappointed by a meal or the service here."}
{"text":"We have always had a great experience here. The service is awesome and the food is great. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Very respectable food and a very reasonable price.

Their skillets are fantastic, especially the green chile skillet.  the BBQ platter is also respectable considering it is not a BBQ place.  As pointed out in a few other reviews, the carrot cake and German chocolate cake are AWESOME.

If you're up for a challenge, come in on an empty stomach and try eating their monster 'breakfast pile' (I forgot what they called it, but it's basically everything on the breakfast menu on a platter) and get your picture on the wall.

Some cool photos and memorbilia there, a cool place to go if you have fond memories of the '50's and '60's."}
{"text":"50's themed diner.

Excellent food - huge portions. 

Our waitress Jamie was great very personable and attentive.

We will definitely be returning. 

The menu has a large selection to chose from.. something for everyone."}
{"text":"Was recommended by my Auntie for Sunday morning breakfast, and this place was great all around. 

Family owned and run local business, classic old school diner feel, good service and good food. 

I had vegetarian omelet, specific instruction for vegetables were provided and followed. I was very happy. My auntie had french toast combo and she enjoyed her breakfast. The portions were good, the server checked on water and coffee few times while we were there. 

I will definitely go back to try other options."}
{"text":"This place was decent. My first time here. It was casual. Food menu looks good. I had the bacon Cheeseburger and I have to say it was just ok. The prices are pretty good. The meat didn't have flavor. The place was clean. The bathrooms were clean as well"}
{"text":"We love Chases diner. Great food and great service. We always enjoy going back and trying something new off their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. My family found it while I was at work one day and they all called me raving about how amazing it was. Two days later, they insisted I join them and I wasn't disappointed. My favorite breakfast dish is the Chili Cheese Omelette and for lunch the Reuben. You can't beat a good Reuben. Their onion rings are delicious as well. Effortlessly battered.

My entire family likes the Belgian Waffles and they fill an entire plate."}
{"text":"I love love love this family owned and operated spot!! The staff is always ridiculously amazing and friendly, and they always recommend the best dishes based on what you like. We will ALWAYS come here and support this awesome establishment! Especially with two toddlers who are always well taken care of here!!"}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed. I really don't understand the great ratings and reviews. I've been in here twice, and the place is not super clean, the food is so so and the wait staff make you feel like they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. I've tried the Rueben, which was lousy, and the burger, which tasted horrid. Could it be I've just come at a bad time?"}
{"text":"Great home-made food, friendly family owned restaurant and good prices. What else do you need to know. Bring an appetite"}
{"text":"Always drive by this place thinking it would just be like a dennys. NOT TRUE! We finally stopped in for breakfast and have nothing but great things to say! Lunch is also amazing but their breakfast skillets (especially the kitchen sink) is hands down one of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Also... Their carrot cake?! Wow. So glad we happened to try it out. Go there all the time now!"}
{"text":"The only place in town that knows not to overcook scrambled eggs!
Best homefries and delightful staff too!"}
{"text":"It was 10am and my 4am bagel was long gone from my tummy. I had just finished an errand at the ACE hardware in this shopping center and realized that I needed some lunch--NOW. The other restaurants in this shopping center don't open until 11 or 11:30am and I couldn't wait another hour to eat. As I drove past Chase's Diner the sign said that they opened at 6am and people were coming and going, so I whipped into the diner.

Now I have to say that I have a fondness for diner food. It is the comfort food that I grew up with in the 50s and 60s in the midwest. When I entered this diner I had the feeling that this was a 5 N Diner clone in the decor, but there were a few differences in the menu choices and this is obviously not part of a chain. My server was Jaime, apparently the daughter of the owner, and her sister was serving the other side of the diner. I went with the turkey breast sandwich on rye bread with a side of mashed potatoes without gravy and it also came with a large dill pickle spear. For $8 it was a very large sandwich with two thick slices (about 1/3\" each slice) of actual turkey breast (not the store bought packaged slices you get at Paradise Bakery). The mashed potatoes were real, red-skinned potatoes and had a perfect consistency, flavor, and temperature. The pickle was fresh and crunchy.

Jaime checked back with me a couple of times to see if I needed anything. The tables, chairs, and booths were all very clean, but the floor could use a little elbow grease in places. Parking is plentiful and close to the door. Overall, I would recommend this family-owned and operated diner."}
{"text":"This diner is modeled after a 50's style diner. Classic 50's Formica on the tables and counter tops. Little jukeboxes on each table, sparkly vinyl booths, etc... The walls are decorated with all things 50's music. Records, contracts, photos, etc. The menu is extensive. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, deserts and snacks. Typical diner food. Our server was attentive and very nice. We actually put a quarter into the table jukebox and our server came over with a quarter telling us that the table boxes were out since the last monsoon and wanted to replace our quarter! Very nice!! Our food arrive in a timely manner. The grits were good and so was the eggs Benedict, hash browns could have been much crisper though. The sausage links were nice and tasty. Prices were reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I've had the turkey dinner many times.  Turkey is succulent, gravy wonderful.  Meat loaf is wonderful.  Beef stew is excellent.  Chicken fried chicken is excellent.  I didn't care for the chicken fried steak.  I thought the crust had no flavor and it was very thick meat.  I like it pounded thin.  When I said I didn't like it they immediately let me order something else and it was delicious. The deserts are the best I have ever had anywhere.  Most every thing I have eaten there has been homemade, from scratch and wonderful."}
{"text":"We love going here for a home cooked breakfast!! We've had almost everything on the breakfast menu and we love. Large portions, good food and cheap prices are our favorite places to visit."}
{"text":"Cool, non pretentious old Skool diner. Food looked and tasted homemade, authentic. I ordered the waffle with strawberries and whipped cream, perfectly cooked with crispy texture, and LOADED with strawberries.  Followed by banana cream pie for dessert.  I will be back while in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I have found in the Phoenix area so far. Cooked a perfect medium rare. It was a thing of beauty :)"}
{"text":"This is a diner modeled after diners in the 50 ' s.  We sat at the counter and all of the staff gave us a warm greeting. Big menu with a bit of everything! We sat at the counter and saw quite a few of the dishes, making my decision that much harder. I had the chorizo skillet and a side of the green salsa.  Great kick in the salsa and love that they use beef chorizo.  Everything was good and fast!  Our server Sophia made our day! She was so sweet and very helpful.  You could tell the entire staff work well together and really liked each other.  Great customer service and really good diner food.  Not crazy prices either, I mean what more do you need? 
Diverse menu, great prices and awesome staff.  Thank you for making us feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"Once again, ordered the same dishes, couldn't help myself!  Prices have risen and service has dropped some.  
They didn't serve bread with the meal as they had previously.  What was served was as good as ever, delicious, abundant and hot.  Our server appeared to be \"too\" busy, so we felt just a bit ignored:(
Yes, I will return and try a slightly different time of day (4:30 PM, Friday) or the day itself.  Still a good place for a great comfort food meal!"}
{"text":"First time here... We wanted to try a new breakfast place. 

Being Sunday, we weren't sure if we'd be fighting the after church crowd. We arrived just after 9 and got a booth right away. Sweet! 

Our server Shenae (Sorry if I spelled it wrong, girl ) was AWESOME! 
She helped me out with my decision making about what to get, came by to check on us just often enough, and had a very friendly smile. She really paid attention to detail. She brought me a box at the perfect time and without asking (maybe she knew I was secretly wishing I could take the syrup) she brought a lid for the little syrup cup. Wow! Couldn't ask for better!

There were also 2 people...nice tattoo dude and a kind woman who came by to refresh my coffee a couple of times. It really seemed like a great system of team work for the benefit of the customer and of course, because the customer is happy, benefitting the employees and the business. 
Everyone looked happy! I loved it. That rallying quality a pmakes guests feel welcome. 

The busser came before we left and asked very nicely if he could get the plates out of our way. Very prompt and polite. 

I almost forgot! The food!   
The food was great. That french toast was amaaaaaaazing.   The green chile skillet was a perfect amount of spicy for this AZ girl, and it was HUGE! I had to take 1/2 of it home.
My boyfriend said the sausage links were his favorite part of his breakfast.

I'm sure we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food with great company. The food never disappoints. This place is a family favorite. They have an array of different classic American dishes set in a diner themed in the 1950s establishment."}
{"text":"One of the \"review highlights\" for Chase's states \"They have great biscuits & gravy\".  I imagine if you had never had biscuits and gravy before, you may believe that to be true.  Surprisingly however, biscuits are not supposed to be dry and look like they were cut from a sheet.  I do not hold that against Chase's however, it is extremely difficult to find good biscuits around here, and their effort is no worse than many.  Fortunately there are plenty of good things to make up for it.  I had Andre's Green Caliente which I thought had a pleasant spicy taste.  It did not really live up to it's name, but it was nice to find something a bit different on the menu that was worthwhile.  The service here was fine, it is a perfectly serviceable spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good parking. Great breakfast place with 50's diner feel.
I got eggs, bacon and pancakes special, Great value and the pancakes were FANTASTIC FLUFFY DISCS sent to your plate from heaven. Try them.
The waitress' were very friendly and gave a great start to the day.
I'll be back when in the area."}
{"text":"French toast was excellent, chorizo and eggs was super greasy. The daily breakfast special is a good deal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and staff.  I like the option of canned or homemade corned beef hash.  I will eat either because I love hash but my fiance prefers canned.  Food was great.  Staff welcoming and friendly.  Jen was awesome!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat beef, but every now and then I crave chili-cheese fries. I ran across this diner, and thought I hit the jackpot.

Wrong.

These were the blandest chili-cheese fries I EVER had. How can you screw this up?! Deep-fry some fries, pour a can of chili and a handful of shredded cheese over the hot fries...boom! Done. Nope. Not here. I don't know what they did. Waste of 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"The staff was really nice the food was very flavorful and large portioned. Put money into the jukebox & they didn't play out song, that was the only unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"Very decent diner food, nice servers. The place looks like A 5 'n Diner that got converted to an independent restaurant. Good food, great biscuits and gravy. Ice cream in the sundae was unique, almost an ice milk type of ice cream, but still good. Not a bad place if you want a quick diner meal or breakfast and want to mix it up and avoid the usual Denny's, IHOP, etc."}
{"text":"It's diner food - take it for face value.  The burger was ok, the onion strings were not great."}
{"text":"first time coming here, maybe They were having an off day today , chicken fried steak could not eat it too tough,and had no taste same as the eggs ,and hash browns...
I really wanted to like this place nice to Decor inside."}
{"text":"I am in nostalgic heaven right now! I really love these old diners and the ambiance they have! The food here is really good! We had the biscuits and gravy (fluffy and delicious with good flavor!), waffle combo (the waffles are awesome!!!), denver omelet and home fries (which are both worth having), and to top it off; a cinnamon roll! Holy cow!! We ate like kings, on not-a-king's budget!! 100% satisfaction!  :)"}
{"text":"We went to a couple places for breakfast and chases diner was the best.  Country fried steak is made fresh everyday.  A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 
I'm completely bummed over my last visit at Chase's Diner! have to change my review as my last visit to chase's diner was so disappointing  I ordered my usual Eggs Benedict and the only thing on my plate that was somewhat decent were the hashbrowns. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of sausage patties to be added to my Benedict and i don't know if they changed who they get their product from or what the deal is but the sausage patties were so thin and tasted awful ...like something unexplainable and had the texture of gritty sand. The eggs in any Benedict are supposed to be poached over medium. That wasn't the case with mine. The whites were not cooked. They were very runny / snotty in texture  . The Hollandaise sauce which is supposed to be creamy also had that very gritty like sand texture and was tasteless. The ham was cut very thin and was so very dry to the point of being tasteless and incredible hard to cut. Lastly there's the English muffins which are at the bottom of the Benedict. They were so soggy yet sponge like i was unable to cut through them nor could i tear them. I'm not quite sure what the deal was with that situation. They weren't soggy from hollandaise sauce. There wasn't any on them (they've always been skimpy with there hollandaise sauce). The English muffins also had the weird sand texture. I'm so saddened by this as Chase's Diner was my all time favorite place in the Chandler area to go have breakfast. I often would drive the extra distance just to go to Chase's Diner. This Eggs Benedict and everything on it has ruined Chase's Diner for me.  

Chase's Diner is by far the best diner of its kind around. I absolutely love this place. Always so clean. The staff is very friendly & well kept. Service is really quick.. i cannot say enough how friendly how personable and so very family like every server I've ever encountered is. They are all very attentive yet not overly. The food is so great and deserts off the hook. My favorite is the breakfast but i myself am a breakfast food lover! I highly recommend the \" Benedicts\". All of the Benedicts are amazing. They have several to choose from and all are bursting of flavors. The 50's diner is super cute and way cozy. Very easy access getting in and out of the parking lot and easily seen from the road. Easily 5 stars. :-) You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were greeted by one of the friendliest hostesses in town so that was very welcoming. The inside has a really cool fifties Diner look. My husband ordered a burger and although he said he enjoyed it it was pretty interesting watching him eat it because it was not in a contained Patty shape but rather it had completely Fallen apart along with the bottom one. He actually ate his burger with a knife and a fork. I imagine people thought we were weirdos.
I got the egg salad sandwich on White Bread, little did I know that actually meant white sandwich bread. The egg salad was okay nothing special, nothing better than what you would get at the Fry's Deli counter.
We will probably go back again eventually but I'm not going to rush back at this point."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. Food was ok...you receive a huge portion, but mine was dry. I ordered the philly chicken, husband ordered a burger and slice of red velvet cake...YUM! We will be returning because it's convenient and and the good wasn't horrible, I'll just be ordering something different."}
{"text":"We keep coming back for the plain chicken wings. THEY ARE THE BEST! Nice and big and not over done. THANK YOU for doing it right. If everyone could make them like you do they'd be perfect! The rest of your menu is very good too but I'm in love with the wings  :)"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! Jen is our favorite waitress and knows our order when we come in! Opens early and always has friendly service!"}
{"text":"Literally the best place to eat ever. The service was on point, the food was amazing, milkshakes will bring all the boys to the yard. First time here but will be back asap!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our breakfast . We came for biscuits & gravy. They were great. Servers and hostess were so nice and attentive. Glad we came"}
{"text":"Went there last night and while waiting for our food I observed a few things that were a bit concerning and would probably have the health department inspector ding them on...observed one of the girls dishing up salad, using tongs but also her hand to build the salad in the bowl.  Used tongs to add the onion and then fingers to break them apart.  No handwashing at any point.  

When I went to open the mustard bottle, it was so caked with dried mustard, I had to ask for another bottle because it was just too gross to use.  

Watched a young man roll silverware in napkins...touched all areas of the utensils and a couple of times scratched himself and went right back to rolling those utensils up."}
{"text":"Its Friday morning, I have the day off work and wanted to hang out with my daughter & her new baby, we both were hungry, and I thought hey lets go get breakfast at Chases Dinner, I didn't have to twist her arm too much, she loves that place.

We bundled up the lil guy and walked on over there, we live close and I figured if I was going to eat bad, walking to and from would kind of help me out on that, haha.  

I ordered a skillet for breakfast and it came with an english muffin and had home-style potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese ham and two eggs,  I hit it with some tabasco sauce and it was a perfect dish for me, I also ordered a small stack of chocolate chip pancakes, and in my head the pancakes where small, but when they came out to the table, they were huge, buttery, chocolate chip pancakes,,omg they were soo good, but only could eat one, next time I will just order one, yea I maybe a grandma, but I sure do love me some chocolate chip pancakes. 

My daughter ordered there chicken and waffles and a side of sausage gravy, shredded up the chicken over the waffle and covered it in the gravy,,,ok that to me looked do dang good, how did she think of that haha 

Chase Dinner is good comfort food, my kids enjoy this place a lot, so we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Chase's Diner looks good from the outside but once you are inside the food tells a different tale. One of foreboding tasteless potatoes and overall breakfast. Hey, maybe I'm wrong, I haven't been here in awhile because the first time was enough but I am willing to give it another try. Maybe.

Now I'm not one of those sodium nuts who salt their food before they have even tasted it, but the food here is pretty much without flavor and I thought it was pretty much impossible to mess up breakfast. On a lark, I ordered the fried okra just to try to make my breakfast seem interesting. It was so slimy it was off putting and the breading was void of any flavor. I know okra and slime pretty much go together but if cooked properly, you can eliminate the sliminess. 

Altogether everything was pretty much disappointing. I guess the old saying still holds true; you can't judge a book by its cover. In this case, nice cover, but what's inside is not so good."}
{"text":"Came across this place by accident, and was shocked at how great it was.  Very clean interior and a complete American style menu.  The club sandwich came with nice thick turkey breast slices.  This is a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Serious burgers! I haven't  had a burger this good in a long time. Stefan was a perfect server and gave great advice on what to order. The milkshakes are old school and yummy. Chase's has really nailed the old diner essences. Not just posing. We'll be back for breakfast. 
Update- we're still loving Chase's and discovered the brownie sundae which is ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Omg! This food is so so good, great, fantastic. Made to order with the freshest ingredients. Lots of flavor for your taste buds to keep you coming back for more. Nice clean diner and clean looking appearance from all workers. I have been here like a dozen times and customer service is great. I have had the Kelleys got you covered burger, the chicken fried steak burrito and chicken fried steak skillet. The milk shakes were good and the brownie Sunday would have been ok I'm sure but only if they would have made it when I came in to pick up my order. They had my Sunday made and sitting on counter on top of my hot food. It was a melted mess, the ice cream was about 95% melted. I had to just eat the brownie and the spoonful of ice cream that was left on it. All I wanted was for them to add the ice cream on to one ticket with the food not make it when the time I got that the order was going to be ready was 25 min. But other then that everything else about this place was A plus. It's a must try people, seriously. March 5th came for another meal because me and my family can't get enough. We ordered the Mighty Superstition for $24 and it was well worth the cost. It was a giant buttermilk pancake with hash browns sausage gravy, cheddar cheese, bacon, and eggs. The greatest breakfast for dinner that I have ever tasted. And my fiancé told his brother about it so we all went so he could see for his self how good the food was. Now my fiancé is going to bring his other brother down when he makes it into town this week. Can't wait to try some more good food."}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knee!  My first time at Chase's I was visiting my sister from out of town and fell in love with the 50's diner atmosphere, the delicious food, the extensive menu and the amazingly attentive and great service.

Since then, I've moved to AZ and frequent Chase's as much as I can.  It's always a hit!  I'm a big fan of their green chili pork sauce on everything, it's spicy and flavorful and makes my taste buds dance.  The menu has something for everyone and the environment is great for families."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Place around! Family owned and family run which is great if you love to support local business. 
I have been coming here for years. I grew up in Chandler and now live in Mesa with my husband but we make the drive whenever we can to go to Chase's. 
We have converted many of our friends into Chase's addicts as well as this place is just contagious with how good it is that we just cant stop bragging about it (even to random strangers like 2 nights ago). 
Breakfast is their true crowning jewel and they serve this all day. Fresh whipped butter on their pancakes, french toast (made with a custard batter that is so yummy!), and (my favorite) their malted waffles. The home fries are so good, especially with white gravy to dip in. My husband loves their biscuits and gravy. The bacon is thick and cooked very well, not floppy and undercooked. 
Their burgers and french dip are great and all their sides are so good too (the onion rings and sweet potato fries are so yummy). 
The desserts are my husbands favorite. One of the owners Nancy makes so many of them too!
Bread pudding and custard and cakes and pies and cinnamon rolls galore! Now while I enjoy those, my favorite are their shakes, and boy can Jamie (one of the servers) make a shake (Jen too)!  
Prices are totally great with my husband and I getting out with around a 25 ish (pre tip) total for breakfast and boy are we normally pushing the \"coma\" level of full.
It can get quite busy on weekend mornings but its worth the wait to get in if you hit one of those peak times. 
Thank you Skip and Nancy and Jen and Jamie and Matt!!"}
{"text":"a great diner in Chandler. incredible service, great food and good sized portions. the service and atmosphere are worth making this a stop when you are hungry."}
{"text":"This is a great 50 Style Diner just like the ones I grew up with back east.  The Waitresses are very warm and welcoming. Quite a few people here.  And it's 9:30 a.m. on a Thursday. The breakfast burrito is huge."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good. Service was fast. Diner was clean. Prices are fair. I want to go back"}
{"text":"Had the combo special eggs, bacon, pancakes. Nice!  Best waitstaff ever. Classic diner--great weekend brekkie!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place for years, never really thinking anything of it. However, wanting to try something different, I decided to stop in. This place is DEEEE-LLIICCIIOOUUSSSSS!! 

I'm sooooo mad at myself for not coming sooner. Smh. I ordered the patty melt with a side of onion rings. The meat was juicy as can be!! The whole meal was just delicious! The wait staff was very friendly and I loved that I was able to pick music from the jukebox. 

All in all, I'll definitely be a returning customer!!"}
{"text":"I love Chase's Diner! 
My family and friends have been going there regularly since they opened. Its a great diner with the pretty much diner classics you would expect.... not too mention some unexepected gems as well. 
The restaurant is always really clean, and the staff is always friendly. Often times when you walk in the door you will be greated not only my a hostess/server, but also a freindly shout from the kitchen too. 

I am a big fan of their chicken fried steak. They have a dinner and a breakfast option for it, however I always opt for the breakfast one regardless of time of day. 
A good cup of coffee, Chase's chicken fried steak, two eggs over easy, some soudough toast , and life definitely doesn't suck. 

Its hard to say enough good things about Chase's Diner... 
I guess mostly it is  great to see a locally owned small business that values its customers having success. Chase's is a great example of exactly that!


Another great tip- They also have a killer  chili cheeseburger as an off menu item. Really good!!! Especially good if you can get it with the green chili too!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was bland. Cute atmosphere, but the food was all under seasoned and very average. We got the French toast combo and the eggs benedict, and it was pretty meh."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here...again! This is our go-to place whether it is just us or we are meeting friends. Food is simple but good. Service is friendly. Owners are great community-minded people. Everything you could ask for from a family-owned and operated business that has been around nearly 20 years. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was gross. I had the turkey club, it was covered in mayo. The bacon was cold and chewie, probably cooked in the morning. The 'made in house' turkey almost seemed canned. it was an off white to gray color. It came with fries that were unseasoned and overcooked. The pepper shaker on the table looked like it hadn't been washed since the place opened. The cheese was basically a Kraft single. 

The service was okay. The server didn't introduce themselves. The food came out really fast, but that's because they only assembled the club instead of making everything fresh. 

I wouldn't recommend this place.

Overall just gross."}
{"text":"Holy moly the slice of carrot cake is huge!  And delicious! They have a great cup of coffee. The service is excellent too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in one early Saturday morning after a trip to the farmers market place was busy but had no problem getting a table service was excellent as was the food we both had the skillet meals one country one kitchen sink so much food that we ate the leftovers for breakfast on Sunday Check this place out if your on this side of town or live close. Food was served hot and quick coffee was alway full servers tag team to keep you happy."}
{"text":"Best diner around!! Always thought the east coast had the best diners, I was so wrong! I love everything on the menu here. You can't go wrong. From breakfast to dessert you can eat every meal here. I live down the street and come here all the time. The BLT and burgers are my favorite"}
{"text":"I like this spot, always clean, good food and good service. a great place to grab a quick burger or patty melt, oh and don't forget about their shakes there Great!"}
{"text":"In the area, stopped based on 4 stars. Service was good but other than that, nah! Biscuits and gravy tasted like flour,  eggs were runny and sausage was dry."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!! The atmosphere was fun and a great 50s diner recreation! The food was excellent, the quality was great and portions were massive! Chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly, eggs were not over done and bacon was delicious. Server even noticed that the English muffin was over done and insisted she bring a new one! Excellent service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Have visited Chase's multiple times and enjoyed it every time -- I'd say my husband and I are becoming regulars here. Consistently great service, great food and decent prices. I can personally speak for both their breakfasts and their dessert, as both are great every time. The atmosphere is nice too, as long as you like diners."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of diners, but gotta be honest I wasn't too crazy about this one. Our server was awesome, super friendly and helpful in answering questions, but the food I ordered wasn't too great.

I ordered biscuits and gravy (the full order, which I have to add is ALOT and barely ate half of it) and some country potatoes on the side. 
I felt like there was just a lot of flour going on in my food- kinda bland no flavor. The country potatoes were the best part and my pepsi. 
The overall consensus at the table was it was decent not bad, just wouldn't go out of my way to grab a bite there in the future.

Maybe I should have went with chorizo?"}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast Menu. The staff is friendly and they make sure
your coffee cup stays full:) Food is really good:) A Great way to start your day!!"}
{"text":"Cute diner ! Very busy, minimal service, mediocre food. I thought it was ok .. I wanted to try something new , And I did... Back to the biscuit cafe for me"}
{"text":"Have never even seen this place, but found it while looking for a nice Sunday brunch. The place is super cute, and we were seated immediately. Lots of options, the food came out quickly, and was deliciously filling. The only tiny complaint I have about this place is the pricing. A plate of two eggs, two pancakes, and two bacon/sausage is about $6, but a bowl of mozzarella sticks is $7 something. Seems a little backwards to me. All the appetizers and finger foods are almost as much as the entrees."}
{"text":"Best patty melt and strawberry shake ever! Service was fast and friendly and food was really good. Highly recommend this place. I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. I love love love this place!! Their 'The Works' skillet is amazing and so is their French Toast. It's made with a delightful custard batter that can put a smile on anyone's face. To be frank, all of their food is great. The service is stellar too!! You see a lot of the same people. During the week, they have a great breakfast special. There is no reason to come eat here!! Jaime is the best waitress ever!! Ask for her!"}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast I have EVER had. I got the Chicken green chili omelet. And when they say it is spicy, it really is. And it's amazing! My daughter had the bacon skillet and raved about it. Same with my son that got the chili cheese omelet. Will be making it a regular breakfast stop for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"This diner has very great food and service. I've been here probably about 10 times and take every one I know that hasn't been. Their breakfast is amazing, especially their bacon and hashbrowns! Biscuits and gravy are the bomb as well!! Their chicken fried steak is to die for. I've also had the big oh slice of carrot cake that is home made. Great atmosphere and friendly staff every time I've been. Oh yeah and their salsa is sooo delicious!! It taste like the one I make at home, all they need is chips to go with. I am from Texas though, so maybe it's just southern thing. I definitely recommend coming here. The prices are decent too."}
{"text":"Came here today for breakfast and me and my husband both enjoyed our meals.  He ordered the Kitchen Sink skillet which, as the name suggests, has a little bit of everything.  The portion was large and it came with toast and a side of their spicy (legit spicy.  We love hot food and this wasn't a disappointment) green chili.  He really enjoyed his meal and said that the quality surpassed other diner breakfasts.  I had a few too many beers last night, and so I elected to have the chili dog for breakfast with a side of fries.  For $10 this was a lot of chili dog, holy moly.  The dog itself is beef and a foot long.  They cut it in half, grill it, place it on a bun that is more of a sub sandwich bun than a hotdog bun, and cover it with chili and cheese.  The chili was a little bland, and the bottom of the bun ended up getting soggy (I can't stomach soggy bread, so that had to go), but overall it was just what I needed this A.M..  The service was quick and friendly despite how busy they were and refills on drinks were punctual.  Looking forward to returning to try something else."}
{"text":"I don't know if I hit it on an off day or what but the food I had was downright bad, cold and in the case of the sausage ,riddled with pieces of veins!  Not appetizing to say the least.  All four of the meals that my party had were substandard.   Serves me right for jinxing things by saying \" it's a diner and we want breakfast, how bad could it be?\"  Answer:  Bad."}
{"text":"Step back into time with Chase's Diner. From the chrome interior, with the puffy red booths and jukebox stations to the overwhelming menu and cheap prices, this place is a winner. With its loyal followers (yes this place is pretty busy most every time I've visited), I'd imagine it's become staple enough to stay. The staff is overly friendly and ready to keep your coffee cups filled to the rim! Oldies rock? Check. Milkshakes?- yes they make 'em fresh and with real ice cream. The classic diner checklist is pretty full with this one.

I've eaten breakfast and lunch at Chase's. Let me give a quick review of the plates I ordered. The egg salad was fresh, with just enough mayo and placed atop toasted bread of your choosing. The side options were plentiful but I stayed with french fries. The grease-o-meter reading was relatively low with this order. For breakfast I stick with the 2-egg meat combo. So 2 scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon and toasted rye. Greasy town! The bacon was literally dripping with diner grease- stuck some napkins on there to soak it up! Order lots of water with this meal- may save your tummy from a future disaster.

Come here for the atmosphere and friendly people. You can decide if you want to stay for the food. ;-) It;s your typical diner fare- cheap prices and decent food. I've come back several times (as has many others) so I categorize it as a \"keeper\" but just know what you're getting when you visit."}
{"text":"Beyond dissapointed. From the reviews and $ sign i thought it would be affordable. We walked in and a lot of the decor is dirty, broken, and the seats were ripped.  Not only that but the floors were very grimy. We started with soda and opened the menu. I was so ready to walk out.  Burgers were 10.49 and up.  The only one under $10 was without cheese. The appetizers were over 7.00 from what i saw and the soups were over $4.00. I didn't want to be embarrassed so we stayed.  The waitress was great though. Very friendly and refilled our drinks without us having to ask.  Food came out and the burger was huge. It had a good taste as well.  You get your choice of cheese and i asked for cheddar.  I was pretty surprised when i had a small amount of somewhat melted shredded cheddar cheese.  I know cheddar slices are expensive but jeeze it was pretty bad. For that price i can't believe they just put a table spoon of shredded cheese on it."}
{"text":"Chase's let us down today....please accept our feedback...

Took the family in for breakfast, dropped ~$60 in the process. I had the chicken fried steak, dry and tough.  Over-easy eggs and hash-browns were pretty good.  Ate the eggs and hardly touched the steak.

Feedback for the staff.  When you offer a patron a take-home box for food that is hardly touched and they decline?  This should be a flag that they did not like the food, and you should follow up to find out if they did not enjoy it.  Take appropriate action if they did not.  Many folks will not complain, but just leave and never return to your restaurant, or short you on the tip.  ( I did not short you. )

My wife's  pancakes shared the same fate.

Our daughters did eat their food, but were not delighted.

Going up to the counter to pay, I figured it would be an opportunity to respond about our dis-satisfaction with the meal.  The cashier did ask, \"How was everything?\"

Feedback for the staff.  When you ask \"How was everything?\", and the customer replies \"Meh\".  Don't reply with your own \"Meh\", and then blithely move on with process their payment.  ( Yes, she literally replied \"Meh\" in nearly my own inflection. )... Instead, use that as an opportunity to dig deeper, and find out why they were not delighted.  Take appropriate action to correct the issue.

Maybe I expect too much, but there are plenty of other restaurants where this level of customer service is a given.  I'll take my business to them."}
{"text":"Hospital food served in a grungy atmosphere with lousy service."}
{"text":"Delish!!! Yummy! ! All those words that describe good food at reasonable prices!  I stopped here on a whim because the place looked so cute..old aluminum 50's diner. Food is typical of \"comfort food\" and the corned beef hash breakfast I had was just that! Eggs cooked just right,  yummy hash browns and REAL rye toast. .the kind you used to get with caraway seeds and all. Go. Eat. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally a real diner close by. Had the Friday Fish and it was good. 
But not as good as the Red or Green Chili. 
My next visit will be a bowl of Red Chili with some Green Chili on top for heat( it's really hot) and a dollop of Sour Cream. I'll even pay extra. Had a cup of each and they where awesome when mixed together. Had to try it.
Have the Carrot Cake. So very good. Plan on sharing the huge piece they give you."}
{"text":"My favorite spot. The waiter was just the sweetest. She talked to my kids and allowed them to order. She assisted me in packing up our food and bagging our plates. She was wonderful and every time we go my family and I leave happy and full."}
{"text":"I love spots like Chase's Diner. They have hearty, filling food with large portions at a fair price. The atmosphere is casual and an ode to the 50s era with shiny chrome and bright red accents and old school jukeboxes playing classic songs from the era. When I heard \"Earth Angel\" on the speakers I had visions of Marty McFly coming by strumming a guitar, then slowly fading away at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance! (Yes, I've seen that movie too many times) :)

We stepped in and were greeted warmly by the host who seated us at a comfy booth. We browsed through the menu which has a wide selection of breakfasts, sandwiches, and dinner plates. I decided on the chicken green chile omelette and had some of the Buffalo chicken finger hoagie. The meals came out in a short amount of time and smelled wonderful. 

The chicken sandwich had a nice zesty taste to it and the meat was lightly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was a nice colorful looking plate. The omelette looked like one hot mess but boy was it good. It had light, fluffy eggs, with breast meat chicken, tomato, and onion filling and a generous heaping of green chile pork with cheddar cheese on top. I loved the spiciness of the chile; it had a definite kick to it! The hash browns were nicely seasoned, perfectly griddled, and there was a fairly large stack of toast to go with my meal. 

Service was good and we were checked on as needed. My meal was so filling I could only finish a little more than half of it.

I'll be back to dine here again!"}
{"text":"I ate here years ago and both my aunt and I had terrible food. However, I've since been back a few times for breakfast and have yet to be disappointed. I'm so glad I gave it another shot!"}
{"text":"The food and service were pretty good. I had the chicken fried steak with hash browns and eggs. The steak was hand breaded and tasted very good. Also shared a pancake with pecans and chocolate chips. Yummy!!! My girlfriend had the chicken fried steak breakfast burrito which was massive. It would feed a small village. I would have given it four stars but I thought it was a little pricey. Overall a good breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Not sure where the amazing reviews are coming from, or maybe we caught Chase's Diner on a bad night, but this was one of the more disappointing diner experiences we've had in recent memory. On top of a 35+ minute wait for our food, the dishes were mediocre at best. (And why the long wait? My wife sent her omelette back because there was cheese inside--the menu clearly omitted that fact, but not a deal breaker--and a new one was served up in less than five minutes. So what did they do the other 30 minutes? I understand if there was a sudden rush of tickets right before our order was placed, but didn't seem busy enough to warrant such a wait. Anyhow, I digress.) 

We were starving at this point, so the Dre's (patty)  Melt I ordered was mostly devoured (as a patty melt connoisseur, I'll give it a pass but the meat needed more seasoning), but my wife's face told me all I needed to know about her spinach omelette. She also clearly verbalized it: \"This is the worst omelette I've ever had.\" Doesn't get much simpler than that. 

So, Chase's Diner, great job on the atmosphere--you pulled off the feeling of 'diner' very well. But otherwise, from our experience, everything else needs work. 

Two stars because the waitress was cordial (but also never refilled the water) but the food and wait aren't worth it."}
{"text":"Only because of this travesty of a skillet...we come here a couple times a month and it is usually GREAT for standard diner breakfast fare. The dude in the kitchen didn't scramble all the ingredients in the Works skillet. He threw chopped onions, raw bell pepper and tomato on top. The mushrooms were tossed in too so they were also not warm cooked. Skillets are like scrambles aren't they? Everything is tossed in the raw eggs then scrambled together in a skillet...right? I don't know but yucky. I will come back I am just writing this one star because maybe the boss will have a conversation with the cook and tell him/her that skillets should probably not have ALL the ingredients thrown on top all raw."}
{"text":"Really great place!! Food is awesome! And you get a lot for the price! Oldies music they play and songs you can play to are awesome!!! Really takes you back to the 50s. Just need the roller skate waitresses. Lol. This place is a must come to on a date night, or family night!"}
{"text":"A very relaxed Easter Sunday, checked out this casual Diner. We really liked it. Our waitress Jen was quick, attentive and genuinely nice.  The fluffy , not too sweet, French toast combo was perfect. Sausage patty was the best I've ever had.  Tried my husbands strip steak was very flavorful & cooked just right, medium rare. Great job Chef staff! Finally, I noticed the buss boy (found out his name is Anthony). His work ethic is very impressive. He's right on it & very thorough.  To top it all off, the owner, Skip ( working on Easter? Very nice) made sure to acknowledge each guest. We will return!"}
{"text":"There was no wait on a Saturday morning. Service and food was perfect. Our waitress kept our drink full and was friendly. The lady at checkout was also friendly and made conversation. Our food was delicious and served very quickly. I would highly recommend visiting this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place was amazing. The French Toast was so good, I ordered another helping. I can't say the same for this visit. I'm not sure if my waitress Misti wanted to serve my table but; she didn't ask me if, I wanted anything else besides the water I was drinking before she came to the table. She took my order: French Toast combo sausage patty well done and eggs. Gave me my food when it came out dropped the receipt a few seconds later and that was it. No follow up nothing. I asked another waitress if she could get Misti because, I thought the French Toast we're different from the last time. I also had to wait for eye contact so, I could order two more sausage patties since my first was sooo good.  A minute later Misti had a new receipt made. Misti had the cook make me two sausage links, when I told her I wanted the patties she insisted, I just try the links because she likes them since there meatier. Nope, not for my taste buds. She said okay and told me they were making them. Dropped another receipt and left. Seven minutes later she brings me one medium well sauage pattie. When I asked her where was the other one because she only gave me one and not two she said that's how the meal comes. I told her okay. Due to me getting irritated and not wanting to cause an issue. It sucks to ask for something and get what someone else wants you to have. I paid for my food even though, I didn't eat the other two french toast and pattie. I may have to pass on this place for now on customer service is really a hit and miss. Thank you but, NO thank you."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found our new Sunday breakfast joint! The food is delicious and reminds me of home. Excellent portions, friendly staff, and good prices. I now look forward to Sunday mornings, just for Chase's Diner!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and milkshakes. Fun place to go to. Staff always great. I don't usually like burgers at restaurants, theirs are really good. It looks and sounds like an old fashioned diner. There are lots of other food choices."}
{"text":"We've had The Supertition and it completely feed my family of six. Fun thing to eat for the family. Nice people, great desserts."}
{"text":"My review covers breakfast.  Looking for a mid-afternoon breakfast the other day and found that Chase's Diner serves all day breakfast which is my go to comfort food.  But I'm particular about my surroundings.  Have to have a booth and sufficient space between me and the next diner that I don't feel crowded.  Also fussy about service.  Must be fast and accurate.  I ordered standard - eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast and OJ.  They got it to me and they got it to me right with good portions.  The only thing I would have changed was the OJ.  Too sour - try a different brand.  I had a book and my server not only was good at what he was doing but he knew the book and the author so we had a pleasant interchange.  I will return for breakfast again but additionally I'll try their lunch and dinner.  Well done Chase's Diner."}
{"text":"Every time we come here my wife and I ask each other \"Why don't we come here more often\". We used to visit regularly and now live in Sun Lakes, so it's a longer drive. That being said, never tasted a better omelet. So light, fluffy and moist and great old fashioned hash browns. Enough with the breakfast potatoes, people!"}
{"text":"This is just a run of the mill diner. The food was salty and greasy, I don't mind that since it's diner food. However, this place was REALLY SALTY. Got the chilli cheese dog and it was not all that great. To make things worse the service is terrible. I had no idea who the server was, some lady was bringing us food then some other guy brings us silverware and drinks. The coffee literally looked like muddy water and tasted like turpintine. Never going back here and AVOID IT. Just spend your money else where or better yet, just eat your money. I promise it tastes better than the swill here."}
{"text":"If you love diner food you're gonna love this spot.. 

It was our first time eating here.. breakfast served all day.. but i was in the mood for a big diner dinner .. every plate we saw go by our table looked yummy.. 

I decided on the meatloaf platter with red skin mashed potatoes and brown gravy with a side of broccoli .. it was huge and just as expected 

My bf had some monster burger.. with a baked potatoes (weird I know.. he could have had apple sauce .. also on the list of side items).. the burgers here are huge .. his had bacon and a fried egg (he even got to ask for it to be cooked like he likes it.. fried but a little runny).. he enjoyed every bite of that burger!

I took home a ginormous slice of carrot cake, moist and delicious.. each of the three layers has just enough cream cheese frosting so it's sweet but not too sweet .. I couldn't have had this as a meal with a cup of coffee! I will be back to try more menu items and dessert (to go!) 

The waitress was super friendly and helpful when it came to ordering .. plenty of parking .."}
{"text":"Family friendly diner. The employees are all really nice. We bring everyone that comes into town here. The food is great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Chase's Diner was a great experience. We came here with a friend who recommended it and we weren't disappointed. Quick summary: Juke Boxes, Fender Guitars, and bomb breakfast - this place is great! 

After sitting down, Jen came and created us. She was fun, polite, and probably one of the best waitresses around town!! Everything else aside, we stared talking about our dogs and that was awesome! Dear Jen, you're awesome! Haha thank you! 

Now back to it, I ordered the kitchen sink skillet and my friends ordered the French toast combo and 2 egg with bacon and hash-browns breakfast. 

The kitchen sink was HUGE - you'll see in the photo. It was packed with stuff and so delicious. I had to take half of it home and it was delicious the next morning too. The French toast combo looked amazing and my friend said it was the best. My other friend said she loved the two egg breakfast and the hash browns were the best ever! I had coffee and it was also really good. Not too watery or bitter, it was delicious. 

Overall, we WILL be back here again and I can't wait to try something new! The location is convenient, decorated, and family friendly. The food was in huge portions and was delicious. Coffee is great, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Very good Breakfast..we are saying good bye to the traditional breakfast place that America Goes to. This place is awesome ,breakfast is so good and homemade taste. I got the meat lovers,and my wife got the chicken fried steak..it was huge!..but very very good my wife said and I had a taste of also and very good!.."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this place.  It feels like an old diner.  I had breakfast and it was about average in taste.  For the meat lover's meal with a small orange juice and coffee, it was almost $17.  The customer service was great and I'll try to come back to try a different breakfast item or try lunch."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in AZ! The green chili is a must have. The food, decor and service are unbeatable. Our server Jen was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"The volcano is to die for! My absolute favorite thing on the menu, the food has always been so amazingly tasty and good! The service is always top notch. This is my absolute favorite place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the second time because I live in the area. First time was sub par for lunch, basic food items that was nothing out of the ordinary. Second time, for breakfast. Service was horrible, cashier took forever and served other tables before us. Food was just \"ok.\" But for the amount of money you spend, not worth it at all. I would choose Denny's over this place."}
{"text":"This place is located conveniently close to me, so I had to stop by for a weekend breakfast. The decor is classic 50s diner, so I really  wanted to like this place but I came away disappointed. The service was fine, the food looked delicious, but ultimately everything I tried was bland and forgettable.

Sometimes I am hesitant to trust my first impression of a restaurant's food... as if my taste buds might be having an off day. However, I went with a friend who is potentially the world expert on biscuits & gravy. Absolutely every breakfast joint he dines at, he samples their biscuits and gravy (in addition to the regular breakfast). Biscuits + white sausage gravy should = delicous. Not here. It must've been made from a mix.

Sorry to say I didn't enjoy my dining experience here. The food filled the void but had no flavor."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. The servers are very sweet, and the food is delicious! Highly recommend the Ribeye steak and the chicken teriyaki sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place has amazingly large portions that are extremely quality. The staff is kind and attentive as well as fast. My coffee cup was never empty!!

The prices are the best part about this place because it is definitely affordable as well as amazingly done. The quality of food is extraordinary for the prices they sell at.

If you're in the area and hungry, you should stop by!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 12 yrs and I have never been disappointed.  Great prices and service is always prompt Happy Fathers Day.. the diner kind of puts you in the mind of \"Happy Days\" and the prices and quality of food is hands down fantastic."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst service I've ever had ANYWHERE. I couldn't eat the food. IT WAS Horrible.   The waitress was rude. I've been going here for over 10 years ,   WHATS HAPPENED ?   Rock hard biscuits, undercooked pancakes.  Super thin over cooked bacon .  
Not going back.  Lost a longtime customer due to the poor customer service. No owners onsite. Where's  Skip or Nancy?
Thanks for the email SKIP but then not to follow up .,  we now dine down the street 1 mile from you.  There standards on cleanliness, food and service. Are considerably higher than yours are now.  Your restaurant is seriously dirty. Food went from great to marginal to bad . Sorry to see chases go downhill."}
{"text":"Inverse rule of diner wait times:  For each employee working in excess of the number of customers you will wait 10 minutes beyond what seems like a reasonable time for your food.

I have odd habits when I walk into bars & restaurants-I identify the exits, estimate number of diners, actually count if below a dozen, mentally tag troublesome looking folks.  Everybody does that right?  Anyway, before we are seated:  9 on staff that I can see, 8 customers.  Hmm.  Diner fare should take about ten minutes, add ten for the +1 staff count...ding!  My meal took 20 minutes.  Slow for a diner. 

The only reason I am increasing my review to 2 stars is that everyone else I ate with seemed OK with their food.  My cheese omelet was overdone (when the eggs start turning grey) yet somehow they managed to not melt the cheese on the inside.  Neat trick.  I would have sent it back but I was so starved I scarfed almost half right away.

And the home fries.  Deep fried.  Ugh.  I have never seen deep fried home fries before.  They should be called home double fried fries.  I had a stomach ache for about 12 hours after eating here."}
{"text":"Chase's Diner is your basic family-owned diner.  The jukeboxes that adorn the tables are frequently out of order, but the staff is friendly and the breakfast combo specials are a good deal."}
{"text":"DCE Burger was burnt.  Nothing good about it.  Funny I ordered medium rare.

My son had a bacon cheese burger.  No onion no tomato, still came on it.

Great waitress.

I would not return."}
{"text":"We really like this Diner because it's family owned. The whole family works at the restaurant and they create a friendly environment. The food is great too."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this place out but I was pretty disappointed. I got the bacon cheeseburger and asked for it well done and it was still pink in the middle. My boyfriend had the BBQ sampler and it was kinda dry. He asked for broccoli for his side and got green beans. When they brought him the broccoli it was warm in some places and still frozen in others. It wasn't a horrible experience and our waitress was nice but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I hadn't found a decent diner in the valley since Ed DeBevic's closed years ago...Well now I found one!
The grilled parmesan bread really took the burger melt with onions amd bacon to a whole new level. 
The carrot cake is outstanding (this review coming from a professional baker)!
Definately will go back again. Taking my family soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in this lovely joint for breakfast to go and they had..................... CARROT CAKE! Talk that talk to me Chase! 

This place is a diner and I love it! It could be built that way I'm not sure if it's a true grimy diner but I love the decor and feel of this place. It had a juke box for all your juking needs. They had lovely cozy red booths. They had a cute bar area to chill at. Dopeness all around.

I ordered the country fried steak skillet and my lady had the veg omelet add spinach with egg whites. Both dishes were satisfying. I couldn't take anything from their food. Love the potatoes in the skillet, good seasoning. 

The carrot cake is big as shit and I want to say $5 or $6 a slice and it's worth it! Rich rich Richy rich! Fresh carrots inside and a bomb cream cheese frosting. Ugh you hit my spot. Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is a find! Family owned, fair priced and delicious. I took my family from Illinois here when they visited and they also loved it. Best skillet I have ever had which Is what I typically get at breakfast places. Love it."}
{"text":"LOVE the GCB. that's all you ever need to get! Love the staff.... Always extremely friendly, even when it's packed wall to wall!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a long time because it's so good. It's straight up good food, the menu is unique without being to out there and crazy. They have this breakfast burrito that they stuff with \"chicken fried steak, french fries, eggs, cheese, sausage and they smother the whole thing with country gravy and more cheese. They don't have anything like that at IHOP."}
{"text":"Came here to eat and very disappointed they would not honor the 20% discount off of their site due to having to print out the coupon. Well this day and age unfortunately I don't have a printer to hook up in my car lol. I'll go somewhere else next time. Family on the go looking for a quick bite with no time to cook dinner."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast! It's always packed, but we have never had to wait very long. The staff is really friendly and always seems to be hustling. Portion sizes are huge, and prices are reasonable. This might sound silly, but sometimes it's hard to find a correctly poached egg, and they have nailed it every time.  I also recommend their biscuits and gravy and French toast."}
{"text":"The overall atmosphere is welcoming and pleasant. I felt at home here. Great food & service. A really comfortable place to sit and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Home cooked, usually great service, reasonable prices for myself and 4 hungry boys! I love the meatloaf or turkey dinner, my son loves the country burrito and biscuits and gravy.  They have ALAWYS gotten our carryout orders right"}
{"text":"The staff was pretty friendly, seated pretty quickly. The creamer bowl on the table actually had cream in it, gross? No one maintaining these tables apparently.
The waitress asked us how our food was like 10 seconds after we got it... 
We both got the chicken fried steak and overeasy eggs. The eggs and the hash browns were OK. the toast was very dry and the chicken fried steak was literally falling apart. The \"steak\" had the same consistency as a McDonald's chicken nugget and the skin wouldn't stay on it when you cut it, so you literally had to eat them separately. It gets a two and not a one, only for the environment. But the food was bad, Denny's does it better and I'm not even a fan of Denny's."}
{"text":"Cute place, but insanely busy and crowded. The food was good, but they messed up both my mom's and dad's order. The waiter was apologetic and nice, but the bill was still full priced even though we had to wait an extra 20 minutes."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding actual real turkey made here on site. The chicken is also amazing! The staff here is also very on top of it and very respectful, I am always impressed when I see so many teenagers being disrespectful it is a breathe of fresh air to see some who actually have respect and manners!! This place gets five stars for me on food and outstanding service!!  And did I mention the pie is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I've moved to AZ from the East Coast where you can get the best food in the world. I've had breakfast food in best restaurants and Diners NY can offer. 
However, Chase's Diner beats them all. Their home fries are the best I have ever had. Their food is made fresh and out of great ingredients. They are packed on the weekends but that only shows how many people love and enjoy their delicious food. This is my number one choice for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and feel it deserves all the stars I can give it. I've only eaten breakfast food here because it tastes great and they have a couple good value items/combos. Staff is always friendly and it usually doesn't take too long to get the food. Music and atmosphere of the place is great. Not too loud or crazy busy which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was told this week while at Chase's that they couldn't make vanilla Pepsi's anymore. Big bummer since I've been ordering those at Chase's for over 8 years. Gotta find someplace else."}
{"text":"I woke up with a mean hang over on Saturday in dire need of some greasy diner breakfast. My roommate told me this place was close, and that she had heard it was decent. Sweet! a breakfast close to the new pad! 

Nope

Walked in to a podium type stand with a hostess behind it. She had her head down. She didn't look at me, and didn't greet me either. She grabbed 2 menus and started walking over to a booth. Half way there, she looked back at me because she probably sensed that I wasn't tailing her. \"Oh!\" I said.. \"You are seating us\". I sat down and brushed her shitty service off.

We sat at that booth for about 8 thirsty minutes before my breakfast partner grabbed the next waitress walking by to ask for water. That waitress was very nice. She took our orders, apologized for the wait. She said our real waitress would be over to help us with anything else needed.

Our real waitress:

Looked like she hadn't slept in 2 weeks, and had about 3 or 4 hickeys on her neck. Show some class girl!

I had a veggie skillet with 2 eggs over medium, instead of scrambled. The eggs were under cooked for over medium. Everything was bland. My roomie just got scrambled eggs and bacon, which she said were fine.. but how do you fuck that up? Maybe I am a snob. Even though the food was crap.. A smile and greet upon entering, and speedy service would have been worth another star to me. Fuck this place."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  The chorizo burrito is my favorite.  Actually everything we've had here is very good.  Also, great burgers and shakes.  The carrot cake is amazing.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  Skip, the owner, is a great guy.  He is very supportive of the community.  You should check it out!"}
{"text":"Love bringing the family.  Haven't had anything that wasn't delicious!  Staff is super friendly!  Carrot cake is to die for!"}
{"text":"Soooo glad we stumbled upon Chase's Diner! Ate there a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon.  We didn't wait at all to be seated. Got a great corner booth.  LOVE the decor-lots to look at and everything appears clean and well cared for.  I have not had a decent rueben since Molly Branagins closed.  Chase's rueben sandwich beats any I have ever had. This includes the East Coast which, as another reviewer pointed out, has the best food in the country. My husband loved his burger. Portions are huge-we both only ate 1/2 of our lunch.  A giant piece of amazing German chocolate cake to share and we ended up taking 1/2 of that home too. The service was friendly, quick, and accurate. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give no stars as they earned it.  It's totally on their snobby service.  Stopped in on Black Friday and to our surprise the diner was about half full but plenty of the wait staff was doing busy work and we figured it would be a quick in and out.  We asked for a table and not a booth as I have back issues and booths are uncomfortable for me.  The hostess said they had none and there was at least one empty not 20 feet from her!  We asked a second time and she said they had none available and we said whats wrong with that table and she said our tables are only for large parties!  So it was off to another restaurant that would appreciate our money.  I won't come back either as I don't give 2nd chances to places that treat you bad right off the bat!"}
{"text":"Decent food....good service ....love the 50's music and decor .....clean .....a good alternative to IHOP on weekends when their lines are out the door....glad I stopped in....I'll be back often...."}
{"text":"Wow. We decided to try it today for the first time and now we're hooked. We found our new breakfast place! Cute diner. Awesome staff. The food was delicious with generous portions. Sausage links are so big and tasty.  We paid extra for whipped cream and strawberries, so worth it! Got tons of strawberries and like 1/2 can whipped cream on the pancakes! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My buddy D is driving from Los Angeles to Texas and stopped by on his journey. He called me from the parking lot of Chase's Diner. \"Meet me here\" he says. I headed over and met D at one of the booths. Our server was Kelsey. She was what I would call, distant. It felt as if she could care less if we were there or not. Hmm. 
D and I both ordered the 2 egg combo ($3.99 M-F). D added toast ($2) and coffee ($2) and I added Iced Tea ($2). I ordered my eggs over easy and they were done correctly. My combo came with bacon and that too was cooked right. I would expect nothing less being at a diner and all, but in my experience, vast as it is, I don't expect much regardless of where I'm at. I've had average steaks at Ruth's Chris but then amazing Pastrami sandwich at Tummy Stuffer in Norwalk, CA. The food here was fine. Exactly as it should have been. D said the coffee was fine as well and the Iced Tea I had was your average run of the mill variety, but again, as expected. The price of the combo was amazing however. $3.99 for this combo is THE way to go. The 2 of us got out of there for under 14 bones before the tip. Nice. The restaurant was clean as was the men's bathroom. Other than our aloof server, nice experience.
Clean facility, good food, great special pricing, aloof server. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"A big Saturday for Little Miss and I as we tried to cram in as many errands as we possibly could in one day. After mommy-daughter haircuts, we were famished and - as mommy is wont to do - I Yelped to see where a good place for breakfast would be. Chase's Diner fit the bill - and as luck would have it, it was next door to my next appointment! So we hopped in the Ferrari of Minivans and off we went to mommy's old stomping grounds in Planet Chandler. 

The place is bright, lively, clean and oh-so reminiscent of the places my parents used to tell me about. They call themselves a \"diner\" and they are a \"diner\" to a T! (or d?). 

We were greeted immediately and decided to counter it. The service was spot on! Waters were promptly delivered. We shared the Denver Omelet and it was perfect!!! Fluffy eggs, veggies with a crisp still in them (PERFECT!) and plentiful with ham. The hashbrowns were perfect! The toast, perfect!! There is absolutely NOTHING WRONG with this place. It's perfect!!! And the M. family will be back - for sure!"}
{"text":"I read that this place has a inexpensive breakfast meal so I'd thought maybe the rest will be priced inexpensively. Their prices turned out to be about the same as elsewhere but maybe a bit higher. They had large portions that helped justify that though. 
My husband & I went there on a weekday early afternoon. Had quite a few people there. The staff was attentive and friendly. We loved the breakfast we had & left completely stuffed! They have great biscuits & gravy. We plan to go back when we next go out to breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This place kind of looks like a run down 5 and diner. The BF went here this morning for breakfast because we had a coupon from the entertainment book and wanted breakfast for cheap. When we walked in we weren't really greeted as much as stared at by the hostess for a minute and then asked 'two?' in just the most enthusiastic voice *sarcasm. But I can't blame her, I would be unhappy too if I were a hostess in a restaurant like this one. Anyway, our waitress was very friendly, which made up for it. I ordered the southwest omelet which is pepper jack cheese, chicken and chili peppers. It was alright.... the cheese kind of looked like plastic and the chicken tasted weird, but I liked that it was a bit spicy. It was just meh. The BF got pancakes and said they were also just ok. I thought the coffee was good standard coffee, so that was a plus. Overall, this isn't a place I would run back to, but if I had another bogo coupon, I'd consider going again."}
{"text":"This was really good diner food. And they let our group party stay, talk, and laugh for hours. Very gracious service!"}
{"text":"The food is great but when I saw plates on top of another with food, that threw me off. 
Servers were standing around chatting while the plate full of food are sitting at the counter & the kitchen crew had no space to put the plates. So they stacked the plates on top of the other plates with food. To be honest, I don't know where that plate has been & to think the bottom of that plate touching my food...ugh.
I'm sorry if I'm a bit of a neat freak & even at my restaurant, I freak out if I see anything touching the foor on plate."}
{"text":"50s themed restaurant! The price was great. $5.99 for a combo meal and over the weekday, it's $2 off! Wished I had more eggs but for the price, I don't really care. It was a cute restaurant and I will probably come back again"}
{"text":"There are days when all you want to do is sit down to a nice plate of chicken fried steak. That's how I spent my Saturday afternoon.

After spending my Saturday morning moving rocks onto my yard so the pesky HOA can stop whining about my grass not being up to their standards, my back felt stiff and there was no way I was going to make lunch. A quick Yelp search later and Chase's Diner popped up! Having seen this cute little diner multiple times, we figured it was a good day as any to give them a try. I wish I tried them out sooner!

We ordered the Chicken Fried steak breakfast platter with over-easy eggs and rye bread and the Andre's Green Caliente with over-easy eggs and more rye. Everything came out hot and delicious! The chicken fried steak was more than generous in size. It had a thick crunchy exterior that didn't get soggy under all that creamy gravy and inside was a huge chunk of meat. It was hearty and filling. The Andre's Green Caliente definitely stole the show. That hot green pork chili... mmm! Put it on everything! I really enjoyed the skillet as it stayed hot and kept the cheese ooey and gooey. I hate it when cheesy dishes solidifies and gets rubbery when cold so I appreciated that the cheese stayed melty throughout the whole meal. The over-easy eggs came out perfect and you can't ever go wrong with rye bread.

The damage was about $27, before tip, for two. Service was a little slow but friendly and the diner was nice and clean. I'll definitely be back! Support your local businesses, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I always make a point to go here when I visit my daughter who lives in Chandler.  I like the decor and the music and the menu has all of my favorites and they are all executed perfectly.  The service is always great.  It seems that everyone who works here is in a good mood.  Is that even possible? And the prices are good as well, especially for the quality and quantity of the servings of down home comfort food.
    I have had the kitchen sink skillet which was great.  I had it with the green chili salsa and trust me it is not for amateurs. Excellent, I do get tired of wussy salsa that you get at most mexican restaurants these days.  I had the green chili burrito and also ordered a short stack which got a raised eyebrow from my server.  When I nearly finished it all he actually gave me a high five.  Hah, cool.  And one of my all time favorites that I try pretty much where ever I go is chicken fried steak.  All I can say is get it at Chase's and enjoy.  You're welcome.  And the coffee and iced tea is great.  Do yourself a favor and check out Chase's.  
     Oh yeah, one more thing.  They have rye toast which makes my daughter happy.  She says that is how you can tell a quality restaurant."}
{"text":"I love chases diner! I visit here for breakfast a lot when I come into town. I was bummed Sophia wasn't working today! She's the best! 
Cute subway atmosphere.  Good affordable food. Weekday special is my favorite.  It's 2 eggs, pancakes and bacon for like $4.50! Sweet deal. I of course had to add hashbrowns. My step dad and mom actually come here often. Good little spot. Been here a long time!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 10+ years now, and things only seem to be getting better! There is something on the menu for anybody and everybody. Make sure you try the carrot cake!! Ask for Jaime!"}
{"text":"This place has it all.  Great diner, cool memorabilia on the walls, and delicious food.  I went here for breakfast on a Friday morning.  Fairly average size crowd for a weekday morning.  The waitress that we had was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  Started my day with some chicken wings as my breakfast appetizer-Delicious.  And then I had the kitchen sink skillet for my main course.  I'm pretty much a skillet connoisseur and this was one of the best that I've ever had.  I didn't finish it though so I had some leftovers to kill later on.  And then I got desert to go to for later with my leftovers- German Chocolate Cake.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Cute little 50s diner. Food and service were both fantastic! And they're dog friendly on the patio"}
{"text":"Got to speak with owner who was  walking around and visiting with with other diners. Nice guy and Cool place with good food. Breakfast portions are generous"}
{"text":"Neato 50's themed diner. Pretty authentic. Has the little jukeboxes on each table and the black and white tiles. It is a railroad type car building authentic. The menu is extensive. What I got was just okay not great not bad. The serving I found a bit small for a diner. However, the other people around me seemed to have fuller plates so maybe a sandwich is the way to go here. (I got the open turkey sandwich with stuffing side and a very large slice of carrot cake for the ride home) 

I was going to give 4 stars but went to three. Let me explain why. The ladies working here were very nice but I do think they should be more attentive and careful with the front door service. I waited five minutes after walking in to have anyone even come out of the kitchen to greet me. That is too long. The door seems noisy enough to hear folks entering if they are in the kitchen but maybe not. Perhaps they can get a cowbell. However, there were three people working so not sure why this happened. Ha! I get they are busy I used to work in many restaurants but still? Beyond that the service was good. 

I also had to knock off a star due to the ladies bathroom and entryway area in front of it. It was very dirty. In fact, it was pretty disgusting. The floor was so sticky in the entry way arch area my shoes stuck to the tiles.  

I am all for second chances. I would go again. I hope I can up them to four stars the next time with a different meal choice. I want to love them because the place is so darling and the owners are from Ny.( LOL) They also have cool memorabilia on the wall, sell fun things, and donate to charity. I like to support local good peeps."}
{"text":"Chases is a great diner. Food is awesome, and they have an awesome theme. Weekday breakfast special is the best!! Runs all day long."}
{"text":"Great service and their $4 breakfast (Monday thru Friday) that includes 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, and sausage or bacon, is terrific :)"}
