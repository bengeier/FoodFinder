{"text":"This is such an amazing food place out in the Toronto eaton mall! It's my first time giving Thai food a try out of the country and when I decided to do so I fell in love with it! Their Schezuan chicken is Soo good with the right amount of spice and their lo mein is to die for! If you're around here check it out as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Walked past this place a few times and decided to give this place a try (as Szechuan/Sichuan food is one of my favourite chinese cuisines).  As a first timer, couldn't really find too many useful reviews about what to order so as a foursquare user as well I went with the \"Cashew nut chicken\" (which had rave reviews on it) and also asked for Spicy Tofu (unknown but its a safe bet and also a complementing veggie dish as well) as a second dish too.   The food was really good for food court fare. The place seems clean. And pricing + portions was decent.    This place also seems to accept cards (unlike most places in Chinatown) so its a bonus as well.  And last but not least, don't be discouraged by the line - it moves quickly."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite lunch spot, until I got sick. I usually order the chili chicken and fried rice and never had any problems...until now. Ate there for lunch and felt queasy on the commute home. After many times going to the washroom, I knew I got food poisoning. This place is popular but watch out..."}
{"text":"Expensive and rude service. Last time I went there. A woman just gave me a dirty look and yelled me saying don't touch the receive I will give it to you. It was very unnecessary and rude. After drinking their corn soup I went straight to the washroom."}
{"text":"A piece of my broccoli tasted like dish soap!!!!  I called to complain and I'm waiting to hear back.  I rarely buy food from them since they're not my favourite as their food is too sweet-sugary tasting."}
{"text":"This place is so good but so bad. I always get rice with crispy ginger beef and I enjoy every bite... until I'm done and I hate myself. Definitely a guilty pleasure or a friday cheat meal...after eating a week of salad.   It sure is tasty, but i'm basically out of commission for the next 4 hours after eating it. The lines go by pretty quickly and the asian ladies that serve you are quick and short with you. No time for pleasantries when theres lemon chicken and beef and broc to be served."}
{"text":"This is my guilty pleasure choice for lunch when I don't bring in meal from home!  I really love the Szechuan chicken, cashew nut chicken and the spicy peanut chicken. Although the lemon chicken is absolutely delicious, I do not order it because it's fattening and unhealthy, you know?  When it first opened, the lines would snarl all the way to the hallway. That no longer happens and you may arrive at any time throughout 12pm and there is a small lineup that moves speedily."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I don't usually eat food court food but I love the flat noodles and the crispy ginger beef.  Their portions are HUGE.  There is always a line in front of this place at lunch.  I usually eat half of the meal and save the other half for dinner.  I tried the chili chicken today but didn't enjoy it as much as the beef.  It wasn't spicy (as promised by the girl behind the counter) and not saucy.  Will have to try the lemon chicken or the general tsao - both look good."}
{"text":"This place in the food court just opened a couple weeks ago underneath the brand new Bay Adelaide Centre.  The selection of Chinese dishes is outstanding! So many it's hard to make a choice on which ones to pick, so you end up getting more than you can devour. The fried rice is nothing to write home about but the rest of the dishes are top quality.   I recommend the Lemon Chicken and Ginger Pork.  The asian staff is very friendly with good knowledge of the food dishes that are presented.  A word of warning, don't expect to be too productive at work after a huge lunch here--you'll need a nap for sure! =P"}
