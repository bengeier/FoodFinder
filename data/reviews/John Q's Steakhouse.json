{"text":"Waitress was extremely nice, cocktails were perfect.  Food was good (garlic shrimp w/pasta) but prime rib was chewy, but I'd go back to try other stuff because staff was so friendly and drinks were yummy."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and it was okay, but not great.  When I go to a Steakhouse though I expect to be pretty freaking satisfied when I walk out, so maybe that's my own problem.

I mean there wasn't anything wrong with the place, it's just pretty blah.  At least a texas roadhouse has mad delicous buttery bread to get you excited, John Q's has nothing to get you excited about.  Also the times that I've gone the service has been a little on the slow side.

It's worth a shot if you work downtown and want to give it a try but that's it."}
{"text":"This is probably a useless review. I was here years ago and I don't remember the food that well. I hade an iceberg salad with blue cheese that was pretty good, but can't recall my entree. Anyway, what I love about this place was that we sat in a little booth with curtains that closed. It was so fun and it made me feel famous."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner during a weekend trip to Cleveland.  

The interior was exactly as advertised - lots of dark wood, dim lighting, and brass.  Great ambiance.  

We ordered the cajun scallops for an appetizer.  They were perfectly cooked, and the sauce was very flavorful.  My wife had a cocktail, and I settled on an \"arrogant bastard ale\".  Nice drink selection.

For the main course, I ordered the bone-in Rib eye (medium) with home fries and a caesar salad, and my wife had the garlic shrimp.  Everything was delicious. 

We finished with the chocolate mousse.  Awesome.

All in all, we were incredibly happy with our visit to John Q's.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"John Q's was phenomenal! Service was excellent, beef was tender, meals were superb!"}
{"text":"Decent quality steaks and food.  They cook it to my specifications, but I wasn't really blown away by the taste.  Prices are also a little on the high side, but I use a $25 restaurant.com certificate whenever I come to bring the price down to a reasonable level.  The big highlight for me are the chocolate covered strawberries that they give you with the check."}
{"text":"Ate here in 2010. This was such a great place.  Cleveland sports memoribilia, great atmosphere, excellent food and service. Ashame its closed."}
{"text":"Happen to stop in for dinner again over the weekend, steak and sides were again very well prepared, also just happen to have the same waitress from our last visit, very nice and attentive,believe her name was Annie, very good experience once again,can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Hello dreary 1980s steakhouse.. This place reminds me of a steakhouse hangout for an old mob movie without the Italian flair.  The decor is dark with large wooden paneling and the old school 1980s greenish chandeliers.  The tables were covered the drab green picnic table-type clothes.  

The staff was very attentive, but the food took a little longer than expected for a salad and a couple sandwiches.  The server told me that the soup was reheated instead of made freshly that day? 

I had a tomato basil bisque soup and the chicken spinach salad with bacon dressing.  The tomato basil soup was hot on the outer edges of the bowl and luke-warm in the middle, classic sign of reheating.  The tomato basil soup reminded me a slightly glorified campbells soup with a little extra cream and tomato chunks.  

The chicken spinach salad fared slightly better with nice tender chicken and the spinach was very fresh.  It was nothing special or particularly delicious, though.  Purely, chicken, spinach, red onion, cheese, and a few tomatoes.  The bacon dressing was very sweet, perhaps an attempt to create a sweet and salty flavor?  The dress left something to be desired.  It didn't even bother using the dressing on my salad.  

Bottom line: you will get a fairly decendent salad at this place during lunch."}
{"text":"Standard steak, without frills -- pricing is a little high for the quality, but it's very average.  With Morton's around the corner, I can't really say I'd plan to come back.  That said, they have large amounts of space, which can work for trying to get a large corporate party together."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out again for restaurant week! First time I came here was for a happy hour, so we didn't try too much of the food.

I have to say it was a pretty good experience, definitely pricey seeing as most of their dishes ranges from 20s to 40 depending on what you get. For restaurant week, you get an appetizer, a main course and a dessert for $30. I got the stuffed banana peppers which were had a strong kick to them but was definitely enjoyable. The entree was a pepper marinated strip steak which I had asked for medium rare, but came out more on the rare side. It was decently tasty, although the sauce it came with was a bit oddly flavored. For dessert, it was a generous scoop of ice cream on top of a giant chunk of brownie. Nothing special about it and didn't taste amazing, but it was good.

For restaurant week, I definitely have to say its a pretty good deal, maybe I'll try it again when it comes around to it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good wait staff. Plenty of places to sit without being crowded by other diners.

Steaks are nothing to write home about. Everything there seemed to be bland to me.  I've heard they have really decent  food at lunch time for much less than the dinner prices so YMMV."}
{"text":"Well...I feel a little guilty giving only two stars...I'm generally a generous grader as long as an effort is being made...and maybe I was there on a bad night...

BUT, like a previous poster, my pal and I just weren't that 'wowed' by this place...and we really had high hopes. We'd missed out on Cavs tickets, and figured splurging on steaks would be a close second.

We'd been to the Chophouse which was good, but wanted to try something new. So, we angled up to John Q's, easy to do given its insanely convenient location, just across Public Square from the Terminal Tower. 

We sat at the bar which had the game on, but with no sound. Hey...I get it...but come on...this is Cleveland, and those are our freaking Cavs. 

We knocked back Christmas Ales (GLBC) while waiting. All the steak pre-game was fine, with a hint of Brown Derby setup (salad, potato). Salad was fine. 

Then the steaks came. I had the green peppercorn au-jus on a NY Strip...the sauce was great, but the steak was a bit lacking in flavor...later, my friend said the exact same thing. He had the T-Bone, I believe.

Again...I'm not ruthless (until the zombies come)...but with the relatively high prices (for Cleveland), I just expected a lot more. 

This is a back-review, because we went there in November...so maybe they step up their game for the holidays...but, not that night.

3 stars said \"A-OK\"...which...this wasn't a-ok...they seem to be in a comfort zone. 

They shouldn't be. Like the 90's, this city is about to be lit up again with more eats and drinks than we can shake a stick at (new aquarium/casino coming to flats, Euclid Ave starting to rejuve)...so they're going to be left out in the cold.

But hey...perhaps they've already got all the customers they need...I hope so...I wish no ill-will on anyone.

That said, I probably won't be back.

P.S. The bartender was absolutely fine, and the waitstaff WAS friendly.

These are strictly food+prices issues. And hey...I once spent $1500 on a dinner...so I'm not afraid of $30 plates...

...as long as they taste good."}
{"text":"The hanger steak as a bomb!! I ordered it medium but got it medium rare or even very close to rare instead. I usually would tell staff and complain, but this time i actually felt I was lucky to have it like that. It was very very juicy and yummy. That steak showed me how steak can be much better in medium rare/rare. 
And, the side grilled asparagus was very fresh n' cooked just perfectly. I was happy with it.
***This is very rare for me to give a compliment for side dish grilled asparagus or steamed broccoli because most of the time at most of the restaurants, the quality are as same as the ones from Boston Market's.

At first, the service was very slow and I was getting mad. But in fact, the waitress was aware of that and everytime she comes by, she apologize to us. And she gave us some incredible service. 

***Some restaurants make customers wait and wait for long time but  waitres doesn't care or usually doesn't even realize it.
As far as I've eaten in this town, a single waitress had this kind of right attitude.
At John Q's, I could feel that they were willing to give us a great service. That is very important in restaurant business.***

I liked their dessert too. It was simple and not overly done like in the most of restaurants. 

I guess I do not trust Yelp. lol
Because Hyde Park gets 4 stars and John Q's get 3 stars? I do get get it."}
{"text":"Had a steak with a baked potato. Steak was cooked perfect. This may sound petty but no bacon bits for the potato. It's a nice place and the food is good. Easy to get to down town place. I stayed at the marriott 2 blockes away. If u like steak u should stop by, but bring ur own bacon. Just kidding u will like this place

Visited November 2011"}
{"text":"Come here for lunch all the time, and sometimes for happy hour.

Decor: wood, classy
Good atmosphere - business crowd
a little over priced, good food, good bartenders, quick and good service
average steak, usually good soups/sandwhiches

somebody in the reviews said free buffet at happy hour??? never seen that - they just give u some pretzels/crackers

party room in the back for like 60 people"}
{"text":"Great lunch today, the Cajun chicken fettuccini was outstanding. Moderate crowd, and noise. Service was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"This place, which reminds you of a Bennigan's crossed with a steakhouse, came recommended as one of the top 10 places in Cleveland. Honestly, Outback is better than this place for taste and service. 

As for selection, it's got the favs like Filet, Delmonico, and Rib-eye and at prices on the high end so you expect the experience to come first class. All I can say is it was a disappointment for a lot of reasons. I had the Delmonico steak. It was cook right and the cut was good, but it was bland. I never reach for the salt shaker and I had to. Judging by the other reviews, this seems to be normal. 

Secondly, the service was marginal. It wasn't like the waiter was overworked. We had to ask him for cracked pepper for the Caesar's salads and worse, he didn't bother to ask anyone else at the table whether they wanted some and left quickly. Furthermore,  he had to be reminded to fill up the water glasses because he kept forgetting. We had imported beer and a bottle of wine served so it wasn't like we were cheaping with just H20. I asked for a Hefewiezen (the only one on the list), but got some random beer. No problem, he brought out the right one. There are more examples but you get the idea. Not sure if inept is too strong of word.

I think the worse thing though was the washroom. It was filthy like an unattended gas station's. It stunk and had debris and empty cups as if it hadn't been cleaned in days. I can understand a slight miss on a busy day, but the urine stench is from lack of sanitation over several days. I told one of the staff about it without a complaining tone, but she acted like was no big deal. What a cleveland cavalier attitude! -- (couldn't help myself. :)

Never going back. Somethings are unacceptable. You should expect more from a so called steakhouse."}
{"text":"Great service and great steaks for the price.  No it is not pretentious and pricy like Mortons, but it is a really good steakhouse where you get to choose your cut from a wooden plank, it is tender and prepared exactly as you want it.  Friendly staff and nice, very up market sports bar ambience.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on our first night in Cleveland. 

Nice interior setup. Lots of dark wood and brass and tons of Cleveland sports memorabilia lining the walls. 

Service was quick and attentive. They even brought out a tray displaying the different cuts of beef. 

Bread was fresh and warm. 

Shared the Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer. Very tasty. 

Salad was fresh and crisp. 

I had the Bone In Rib Eye, medium rare. It came as ordered. Excellent cut of beef. My date had the Rack Of Lamb (actually lamb chops). Very good. 
Dinner came with steamed fresh vegetables. 

For dessert, we shared the Toll House Cake with ice cream. Excellent. 

Dinner, with drinks, dessert, coffee and tip ran about $150.00 

I would definitely go here again if I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Steakhouse with decor and prices that give you the illusion of high-end (dark wood, brass, tablecloths). 
PEPPER steak was lacking in flavor. Scary!
Good ceasar salad and mushroom cap appetizer and excellent service. Decent wine list. 
Food isn't bad, per se, just needs a little liveliness, if you will..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before my flight home.  I like the ambiance and the floor design.  Lots of Cleveland sports photo's and merchandise on display.  The meatloaf is what I ordered and its awesome.  Will come here again if I return to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews before I came here. Staying at the Renaissance across the street. The cobwebs and black flies should have been the first clue to leave. The hubby ordered medium well, they brought out well done.  Creepy service. Won't go back. This makes TacoBell look like a 4 star restaurant"}
{"text":"I don't know.  After reading the other reviews, I almost feel guilty handing out four stars to John Q's.  Well, I've eaten here twice, and both times, the food and service have been great.

Today's visit was for a friend who is retiring, so we all plopped our butts down at John Q's for lunch.  Water and warm, crunchy bread were promptly served to all by our waitress.  A very large LED TV was displaying football reruns immediately to my left, which was nice because I like to watch football.

The lunch prices were reasonable and I was in the mood for a burger.  So I ordered the John Q cheeseburger, medium, and with provolone cheese.  To my delight, the burger was cooked correctly and it was really delicious.  It's not the best burger in Cleveland, but it's definitely big and above average.  The crispy home-made potato chips were tasty and made a nice side.  

Overall, the experience was nice and it was worth the $14 with tip included.  I heard a gentleman next to me complain that the soup was totally cold, but otherwise, this was a very good dining experience from my perspective.  The service was fast and excellent during lunch rush."}
{"text":"Do you remember when a four course lunch consisted of a steak, potato, cigar and scotch (neat)?  If so, you found your place.  This is where old lawyers go to harden their arteries, and young lawyers go to eat from the free buffet during happy hour.  

The steaks are gristley, the clientelle is gristley, the waitresses are gristley (but generally pretty nice).  It's all old school.  Salads are iceberg.  Cheese is bleu.

The bright spot-- the happy hour buffet is really good.  It can be anything from shrimp cocktail to swedish meatballs to a cheese and charcuterie platter.  Free.  For nothing.  You do have to buy an (as in single) overpriced drink, but hey-- free shrimp.

Bring your crusty old granddad for lunch.  Scrape together a fiver for happy hour/ dinner.  We've all done it."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list of \"to-go-to-places\" for a long time!  Finally was able to get there!  Great view of Public Square, and since it is Christmas time, the area was all decked out with decorations and lights.  Walked in and was immediately greeted and shown to our seats (reservations are a good idea).  The attention throughout the whole dinner was great!  From being seated through leaving, our waitress was very attentive to our drink needs, and checked up frequently!  The steak I got was phenomenal!  It was the 10oz Top Sirloin with a melted Bleu cheese and a melted red wine demi glaze.  My fiance go the Black Peppered Strip Steak, which I tried as well, and it too was great!  Along with the steak we both got the French Onion soup for an appetizer, and I honestly think it is the best I have ever had.  Both had salads, and my side with my steak was the fresh asparagus.  We finished off with desserts, I got cheesecake and she got the chocolate mousse.  The feel and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting!  We will definitely be coming back to John Q's!"}
