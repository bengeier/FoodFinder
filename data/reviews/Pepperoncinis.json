{"text":"The service is so bad!!! I gave it three stars cause the food is decent but won't go back, just get take out."}
{"text":"Everyone there is so polite! They're real inexpensive and have good quality service. The staff is friendly and everyone there is from home"}
{"text":"Good local pizza joint. Have really expanded the bar and dining area."}
{"text":"We used to live near Pepperocinis but have since moved away.  Despite the reviews, we went back because we missed their spicy garlic pasta.  And we were pleasantly surprised that it tasted just as good as we remembered.  We also had the breadsticks.  They tasted a little multi grainy, which we liked.  My daughter snuck an extra one:) Salads were fine as well.

I had a bite of the kids' pizza and it didn't seem anything exceptional. The dough was a little off.

Service was a little slow.

Glad it is back.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. The management will go out of their way to make sure u r completely satified. This seems like a good company."}
{"text":"While it is not my favorite pizza place, it still have good pizza, wings, and ok calzones. I have always ordered delivery so I couldn't say how good service is but delivery normally takes at most an hour, which isn't as bad as some other places."}
{"text":"Sergio. We had to stop delivery for a bit because of employee issues. I hired all new delivery drivers and we deliver again. Sorry for the inconvience. I have to say I appreciated ur post....it was very entertaining, and very correct as to our parking lot issues. Funny. Look forward to u ordering delivery again."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Ordered a pizza. It came called. Called and The attitude I got was what do you want me to do about it. Got a prompt response from the manager. Said they would make me a new pizza or deliver the next one for free. The next day I set an ordered a pizza. They said it would be here in 45 minutes. It took 75 minutes. Still paid full price for the pizza. But at least it was hot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Whether I'm grabbing some food or some drinks it's always amazing. The food is awesome and the staff are always so kind."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Steph is the best, along with the entire staff."}
{"text":"An Oakdale favorite!! I always look forward to my trips to Pepperoncinis. 
I came on a Wednesday afternoon so there was no crowd at all. The waitress was very attentive, kind, and welcoming. Everything we ordered came out the right way and tasted amazing! I'm a huge fan of the steak wedgie. There's always the perfect steak to cheese to topping ratio! 
They have a wonderful wing night deal too! Wednesday is there wing night so definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Service was exceptionally slow even with only 2 of us in the bar.  The gyro was good but nothing spectacular.   All food came out at different times and I finished mine before friends even came out.  Fries suck. The waitress bragged about how excellent the food was but was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Awful!  My family went to Pepperoncinis tonight and did not have a good experience!  I had a meatball sub (average at best), my wife had soup and a salad, my oldest had chicken finger basket, and my youngest had a slice of pizza.  

First, the food came out in spurts.  My wife and I got our food first, after 30 minutes.  Then 10 minutes later my son got his chicken fingers.  We were all finished, ready to go and my youngest finally got his cut of cheese pizza, after almost an hour!  This is a pizza place, so why the wait to that degree?

Silverware?  Had to wait for that, drink refills, haha..funny!  

It's a shame because this place is five minutes from my house.  37.00 for that slop too. I WONT BE RETURNING!  Higher priced food, poor quality, lousy service.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"loveeeeee the hot pepper jack cheese balls and garlic parm wings!!!! also, very good desserts I would recommended the fried dough. anything you get here will be very tasty and all for reasonable prices. they also have HOME MADE ranch which is the best ranch you will most likely ever have. also, the one guy in the kitchen is cute. love this place- a definite favorite!!"}
{"text":"For a small town pizza place they really are a good option for a quick dinner out of the house. I agree with some of the other reviews however, something has changed dove they reopened after suffering flood damage. The service can be slow, however it is never unfriendly. The servers and bar tenders are always very welcoming. Good food. A touch high on the price but they have to be to stay alive, because of the mass of eateries in the neighboring Robinson township shopping centres. Try them out, especially on wing night."}
{"text":"This place has literally the worst service imaginable. Have eaten there multiple times. Their food is decent but typically have to wait an extra 20-30 mins from the time they tell you to pick up the food. Finally had to quit this place because a medium cheese took over an hour in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. Manager wasn't apologetic, waitress was terrible."}
{"text":"The kitchen was very slow and one of the entrees came out wrong. They remade that meal but it wasn't cooked fully. I used to like this place but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is great & the service is top notch.  My fave is the meatball calzone.  When you visit, make sure you have a lil time as the kitchen is not speedy.  But the beer selection and access to many TVs with the game on is great.  Also *very* handy to the Pan Handle Trail (Oakdale Trailhead) - so, this is a no-brainer for me :)"}
{"text":"Thank goodness, Pepperocini's is BACK!  Not quite sure what happened a few months ago, but the quality and taste of the pizza are back to normal.  Thank you, Pepperocini's!"}
{"text":"The food there is OUTSTANDING!  Everything is always fresh, the prices are very reasonable.  It's the place I take friends from out of town.  The only complaint is the service is not very good, BUT it is always friendly and the food makes up for the slow service.  The place is clean including the restrooms and as I always tell friends, you can take your Grandmother there and never have to worry about her being offended by anything.... never any offensive language heard from the bar area.  The place is loud when full, but always upbeat.  Just gotta work on the servers, they are friendly, they just need to pay more attention to the customer.  GREAT value also, you NEVER leave hungry OR broke.  Love the place !"}
{"text":"Have been here 6-8 times and although bar is occasionally too crowded to find seats for two, I was never dissatisfied with wings, spaghetti,  rolls or pizza options.  Stephanie is on her game and takes pride in the food and service we received. Surprised at some of the negative reviews but most were relatively old so will ignore.  Do yourself a favor and try this family operation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Pepperoncini's for the first time and were disappointed. We placed an order for delivery from about 3 miles away. We ordered a large pizza, and they told us it it would be about 45 min to an hour. It took almost two full hours to arrive, and when it did, it was cold and the cheese was hard and chewy. We had to heat it up in the microwave to even be able to eat it. It was okay after we microwaved it, but we were looking forward to a hot fresh pizza. We were really disappointed and will definitely not order pizza from here again"}
{"text":"Stoped for lunch good service . Just had a salad  was good but not enough to judge the place on. However the bread stick that comes with is was very good. Noticed they sale pizza by the slice that's always a plus for me . Looking to coming back to for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Checked out Trivia night here. The Trivia was a lot of fun. The food was anything but noteworthy but here's a few notes. 1) ordered a gyro. The meat was ok, nothing to write home about. The bread it was wrapped in fell apart. 2) the side salad I ordered to go with my entree was the best part of the meal. 3) the chicken Parm was huge in size but not in flavor. It actually fed 3 of us. 
I would be willing to go back and try other dishes/menu items but not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Some amazing pizza-steak hoagies. Good in-service, too. They used to deliver and now, for whatever reason, they do not. It's kinda hard to believe in this day and age and in \"America's Hometown\" that a place that makes pizza this well no longer delivers. Man, we used to be able to count on Pepperoncini's for a decent delivery pizza, but nooooo.  They don't deliver anymore. That truly sucks. Makes me not want to go there anymore because of that. I may be the only person that thinks like this though. I am sure EVERYONE else that used to order pizza from Pepperoncini's will now really appreciate that they no longer deliver to the local community.  Folks in a 3 mile radius will now pack the Pepperoncini's parking lot (it's huge) and rush in for a pizza after getting home from work. Makes good business sense that they stopped delivering. It may just be the right call for an increase in business.  Wait, maybe people didn't like that they could order a decent pizza and have it delivered! They probably are more focused now on the valet parking for customers calling in for pizza pickup. Good thing there is exceptional public transport to and from the place, too. Anyhow, they still have good pizza."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in the community! They have a very large menu with something for everyone no matter how picky. Plus they have specials they run daily. Today I decided to stop in during a bike ride along the pan handle trail. It was pretty steady at the bar area and about three tables in total sitting down to eat. I decided to get the pepperoni rolls cause there always amazing! Plus I didn't want to eat to much being I was on my bicycle. Now one thing that stands out to me every time I come here is there ALWAYS UNDER STAFFED! The bartender is the one running food, taking orders, doing refills and so forth so it's a pretty long wait for anything. It's been that way each time I've been here but the food is to good that I keep coming back. I've never been here any time after five so I don't know if maybe someone else comes in later but I hope they hire more people for the morning shift. Other than that the pepperoni rolls where wonderful as always! Perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni mixture not to much dough and just enough sauce. Plus it's only six bucks for three rolls."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Western Suburbs and the price is right."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday evening for happy hour deals (4-6pm). Sides, appetizers, and specialty fries are 1/2 off. 

The four of us split a margherita flatbread, pub fries, and BBQ chicken fries. We all left very full and with two pieces of flatbread to spare. 

We agreed the flatbread was better than the Margherita pizza (and it's cheaper too)! 

And it goes without saying, as long as your okay with ingesting enough cheese/fries/bacon chunks to cause a heart attack, the heaping servings of fries are so so so good. 

Ask fo a beer list - they've got a decent selection of craft beers on draft. I got the Ithaca Beer Company Flower Power IPA, and it didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Well, I wanna say I love this place, but it wasn't a good first impression. About a week before I traveled into this pub, my friends and I ordered pizzas here, picked it up and ate it at home. I was really impressed with the flavor so I decided to venture in this time around.

We walked in and the seating situation was a little confusing. Didn't know whether to find our own seats or wait for a host to seat us, it was packed and it seemed like waitresses were seating people, however, no one came up to us or made contact with us for at least five to ten minutes.

The drink specials were a little misleading. For example, they had summer drink specials that they were no longer offering. Now onto the positivity! 

On the plus side, the food was good and flavorful. We ordered the hot pepper cheese balls as an appetizer, the cajun burger and the buffalo breaded chicken sandwich. The appetizer and burger were both very tasty. The sandwich was too, however it was missing the lettuce, tomato, and onion that it said it had on the menu. If it had those, it would've been a really bomb sandwich. 

I love those hole-in-the-wall bar joints with great food. Pepperocinis definitely falls within that category with it's good food and ambience. Yes, two stars is a hit, but I will definitely return and give it a second try!"}
{"text":"I drive by here everyday to and from work, and then some. We always say we want to try and finally did. The welcoming smell of popcorn was great. The staff was attentive, however only setback we sat right near the A.C. and the draft was freezing. The menu has everything and then some you can imagine. Our server was great and offered us many suggestions. Take your time reading the menu, we will be back to continue checking off items to try. We had the bacon cheddar fries, steak ranch hoagie, and Cajun shrimp pasta. Next time will be pizza for sure. You will be taking home leftovers."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pizza here. They use real pepperoni, so it curls up in tiny medallions of deliciousness on the pie. 

Last night, I ordered take-out, and the pizza was ready in 15 minutes. Pretty impressive, I'd say. 

The restaurant itself lacks in character and draft selection. If you're in for bar food, it's pretty good, but it's loud. TVs everywhere. Maybe it's me being old fashioned, but a great neighborhood pub should be focused on atmosphere, food and beverages. Even if you get away from the screens, the radio is playing loudly, making it very hard for conversation. 

I give it 3 stars, hoping for a little better atmosphere in the coming years."}
