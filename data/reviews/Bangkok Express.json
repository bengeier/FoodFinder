{"text":"Been a few times with no majour issue until recently. Food is decent but not fantastic, and the same can be said about the service. The Pad Thai leaves something to be desired for as well. Went again a few nights ago and ordered the Basil Beef and end up with several days of mild food poisoning which started within less than an hour of leaving.  Buyer beware ...."}
{"text":"Bangkok Express was one of the first restaurants suggested to me in the Monkland area--and even though I've seen it have some pretty stellar reviews--I honestly think it's a bit overrated.  The first impression that I had with the restaurant is that, for the price point of the menu, they've definitely seated way too many people in the dining room. Chairs approach the front door and it's just a little bit too loud.  As an entree, I ordered the Peanut Butter Dumplings for my friend and I to share. The dumplings are wonton soup-style wontons covered in a watery peanut butter sauce. They we're definitely edible but definitely not stellar. Peanut butter is usually a safe bet too...  I had the Garlic Shrimp. The vegetables and shrimp tasted fresh, but the dish itself wasn't more than the sum of its parts.  I ordered a lychee slushie too; probably the best part of my meal. This place would be great if the bill didn't make me feel like I overpaid. There is nothing wrong with running a noodle shop but I want to pay a fair price too."}
{"text":"REALLY great value! I have tried a lot of their dishes, and have never been disapointed. Always fresh and always tasty.They sometimes have lobster. Have you ever had lobster in thai curry sauce? AMAZING!!!  I just love this little restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were visiting a friend nearby, so we popped in for a quick dinner before...  I never go to monkland village, but the neighborhood is quite lively.  At first, looking at the menu, it seems quite unremarkable, it seems to be Thai food with a twist, some ingredients added, some omitted, or presented in a different way.  I guess we can call it neo Thai. Eventhough it's not pure thai, I found the taste of the dishes to be good, it was well balanced with salty, sweet and spicy.  We had papaya salad, thom kha soup, pad thai, and stir fry chicken chow mein, and spring rolls.  When I looked at the salad there was no dried shrimp in it (fresh shrimp instead), but it tasted fine, it was well made and I'm not sure i missed the shrimps... also the carrots and papaya were shredded very thin so it made it easy to eat and light.  The spring rolls were fine, (mine are better :P but I'm not selling hihi). The pad thai was good, a bit on the sweet side but a splash of lime fixed that. The soup again had some weird ingredients like brocoli but heh it tasted fine, tangy with sweet smell of coconut milk yummy...  All in all, it was a good find, and very tasty!!!  Khap khun krab, sawaddee!!!"}
{"text":"Before their expansion this restaurant was a pretty safe bet, however, tonight went back post expansion and was sorely disappointed. It seems that although they have physically grown, they have definitely not prepared for the increase in traffic.   Tonight we waited 50 minutes for our food. We asked the waitress what was going on and she told us it was busy. However, there were several patrons around us who had arrived after us eating their main courses while we were still waiting for our appetizer!   Took another 30 min and two asks to get our cheque. No apology either!  Will not return again."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered delivery from this Thai restaurant and as a Thai food lover, I was incredibly disappointed.  We ordered the Pad Thai along with Tom Yum soup and both were far from satisfying. The Pad Thai was bland and the soup was painful to eat with shrimp that tasted like rubber and a broth that reminded me of soapy dish water.   We also waited about an hour and a half for our order which was crazy having only lived about a 6 minute drive from the restaurant.   Onwards goes the hunt for yummy Thai!"}
{"text":"Lunch between girls on a sunny Spring day. I like spicy my friend likes a little spicy.We both ordered yellow curry; my friend had shrimp I had chicken, we both enjoyed our meal and topped it off with green tea ice-cream. We chatted as girls do in the fragrance of spices and comfortable seating, leaving only to walk in the sun. It's a place that serves a delicious balanced meal. I recommend it."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their appetizers. My husband and I decided to order many appetizers and split a main dish. It was such a great decision! We had the crispy duck (heavenly), the golden bags (yumm but a tad salty), a soup (one of the best I've had), peanut butter dumplings (average), and the sweet and sour fish (loved it). Overall it was very tasty and I will mark this as one of the best thai places to visit."}
{"text":"The food was fine but my friend ordered a vegan dish and I found chicken on it. I wasn't going to write this negative review because the waitress didn't charge us for the dish, but she returned to our table to say that the chef suspects it could have been chicken from my plate when the chicken was clearly seasoned with the spices from my friend's plate. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Good food.  Tasty, filling.  Kitchen was somewhat slow considering place was somewhat empty."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this restaurant for some time now as it is just a few blocks away from my place and I hear great things.  I can tell it has recently been renovated, not sure if it is complete or not.  It does not feel complete, sort of just feels open and temporary...hopefully they do a little more because I think it has a ton of potential to be a cool and classy spot to eat at.  As far as the food, it was very good tasting.;  Much better quality than I expected, fresh and clean tasting.  I had the basil beef dish as a main and it was great.  The green curry chicken wasn't too bad either and the spring rolls were obviously just made as we ordered.  I also had crispy duck as an appetizer and it was very good as well.  Service, however, was a little lacking.  There seemed to be enough staff but they were very slow.  In fact one of our appetizers was cold, and I'm pretty sure it was meant to be hot!  All in all pretty good.  The bill was only about $85 or so for two including a bottle of wine so I really can't complain!  I would go back for sure after I try a few other spots in the area that I have been procrastinating on!"}
{"text":"I always take out green curry from here! The service is fast and the food is delicious:) once they got my order wrong and promptly give me a new dish at no charge. I haven't eaten in store but have had a wonderful experience with delivery there."}
{"text":"I only ever came here for one dish, the garlic basil eggplant and it was amazing until they stopped receiving the right kind of eggplant for their dish so it's not the same anymore"}
{"text":"I have recently fallen in love with Thai cuisine so I obviously had to try this place. It seems to be always busy which is a good sign. The restaurant is clean and welcoming, and has elements of authentic Thailand, but it's not an obviously Thai restaurant. As a vegetarian I love that they have the veggie options already on the menu. The service was very friendly and helpful but slow. I ordered the steamed tofu & vegetable dish with steamed rice and truly enjoyed every bite. My fianc√© tried the peanut chicken and she seemed to love it. Food is very affordable. Portions look huge but truthfully not as big as some other places. Only getting 3 stars because service was a bit slow and food could have been a touch more flavourful, but definitely worth going to again. I really like that the restaurant looks very clean and smelled good too. It's too bad they focus so much on delivery & take out."}
{"text":"A pleasant ambiance and prompt, helpful service, but inconsistent food quality. Even the exact same dish can be quite different when served to two diners. My coconut soup was a generous serving with many different added ingredients in the broth; my partner's serving was a good deal smaller, with less variety in solid ingredients. Strange.   Our dumplings in peanut sauce were quite good, but our tofu-cashew vegetarian plates were nearly flavourless, with overcooked, leathery tofu chunks that seemed to have spent too much time in the deep fryer. And how on earth can cashews be rendered flavourless?"}
{"text":"What's going on Bangkok ?? I've been coming for years and it's just not the same. I love that it has plenty of space and a large outdoor space to eat. They serve alcohol and deliver. It's all there except the quality ! The pice is ok .. not cheap but 12 to 16 if fare for a single dish. What I can't understand is this place has great flavors and consistent. This is the second time I go and the quantity of food is much less.. we had the tofu and vegetables (not a single mushroom) and the coconut milk chicken soup (large). Both plates had two things in common.. 1) that's all they put !! 2) how much salt did they put ??? I'm disappointed.. I did let the staff know of my comments and they seem to not be surprised. It does see the chef has changed .. but I don't see the complexity of sticking to the recipe, I'm no chef ... I'll wait a while before going back, I do miss the way it use to taste.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restos in the city. Delicious food and friendly staff! We try to go here at least once a month!!"}
{"text":"I believe I was there over four years ago.... The food tasted better from what I remember. Today, the food quality has gone down.   We went to get the beef with veggies and the papaya salads. Meh... I will spend my money on Siam instead.   Customer service isnt the best but they were fast."}
{"text":"So sad. Pad Thai used to be great, now not so much. All you get is noodles (6 shrimp down to 2). 27$ tonight got us tiny portions and the container of rice was half full! Skimping on steamed rice? What was a regular take out for the family is no more."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their Pad Thai! You can choose how spicy you want it which is great for those who like it mild, and those who like it hot! (me, I like it hot)"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now.  Tonight was the last time.  The service is horrendous.  New staff (it would seem) would rather argue with customers than actually provide decent service.  The issues are not new, but the arrogance of the staff - which followed the total lack of service from the staff was unacceptable.  The food isn't as good as it used to be, and the service has hit rock bottom.    It's too bad that you don't care enough to try make something right for someone you know is a regular.    Your loss."}
{"text":"Their food quality is just so so. Portions are not a lot.   We ordered spicy crab which only has some frozen crab feet and some poor veggies and it costs 30 bucks! Definitely doesn't worth the price.   The spring roll was made of super thick rice paper, and it was mostly filled with vermicelli instead of vegetables and proteins.  The service was so poor, the staffs were not warm nor considerate at all! firstly the waitress made mistakes on our order, and we had to ask twice for plates and utensils. The food service wasn't fast, either.   I was super disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Water came 15 minutes after we were sitting. The rice and the noodles came 10 minutes after the main entry . The noodles were hard and under cook . Please avoid the service here !!!! Full of actitude"}
{"text":"Been hear several times. Food is tasty but service is not great.  We had to ask for some plates after receiving our main dishes.  When the bill came I put down cash and told the waitress I needed change. I waited and waited and finally asked where my change was.  Then waited some more while they looked for my bill and money. I know it was was busy but get more staff if your restaurant is so popular!"}
{"text":"I like my soupe, the atmosphere was cool, crowd and loud but the service very slow .. At least waitress was courteous and i always like candles in the tables :)"}
