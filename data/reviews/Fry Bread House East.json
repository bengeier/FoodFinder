{"text":"If you live anywhere near this place GO NOW!! First bite of the green chili taco and heaven opened and angels sang. I know someone mentioned not liking the beans. Maybe it was an off day bc the beans and bread combo were perfection. 
Note: the taco is HUGE."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to find this place. Everytime we go to a festival we head straight for the fry bread booth. Well today we woke up craving it. We both got Indian Tacos and we're so excited, they are actually big enough to share. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a unique place. But when I'm in the mood for a burger and a taco at the same time, Fry Bread House's Indian ground beef taco takes care of both cravings. I'm weird.

The ton o ground beef is lightly seasoned and cooked medium-well. It's never dry or way overcooked. It's garnished with some lettuce and just not-quite-enough amount of cheese. They provide a very runny, mild-flavored salsa that seems to get infinitely swallowed up by the Indian bread no matter how hard you try to drown the taco.

The Indian bread, whether on its own or as a taco, is huge, light, crispy all around, soft and a little chewy on the inside. It's like putting soft butter over deep fried butter flavored butter. Amazingly it has never been too greasy.

The red chili has a very deep dry-heat sort of bite. The two times I've had it the bite-sized beef chunks were a little stringy (dry) but good flavor overall.

The counter service is friendly and the orders get table delivered pretty quick. Full sized paper towels are provided and they're needed as you'll want to get your face into the deep fried and/or meaty goodness. Drink refills are free and there's a water spout that will easily splash and drench you if it's not handled carefully."}
{"text":"Update! I came in tonight excited for the green chili on this Arizona chilly day. The gal at front greeted me with a smile, made small talk, while we waited for my credit card to process and thanked me for the tip I left her. There was even 80's music jamming in there that I was able to listen to while I waited for my Togo order. Definitely a different experience but a much better one! 


The food is awesome and I crave this place! The staff could cheer up a bit or act like they enjoy their jobs.. That's the only reason I can't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hot damn this place is delicious! So happy to have found this place not far from my office...

I can't honestly remember what kind of fry bread I had the last time but it was sexy and delicious, not to mention MASSIVE. Folded it took over a whole large takeout container and weighed a ton. I opened it up back at the office and knew I was going to love it, my coworkers scrambling to see what smelled so good. I was NOT disappointed. My friend had the green chile and she loved it.

For dessert I had the fry bread with honey and sugar which was dynamite (and I don't even really eat sweets).

Downside was that I thought I might actually die after eating all that food and I still had to finish my workday. Upside? It would've been a good death and I will be heading back there very soon"}
{"text":"Very cool experience, and very tasty food. I like stopping by once in a while as a treat. Very good and definitely recommend if you have never tried it before."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE fry bread, and love The Fry Bread House.  I have been a fan since 1994 when they had their little hole in the wall location near downtown Phoenix.  I have followed them to the location off of Indian School Road and thank GOD they are now in the East Valley roughly 15 minutes from my house.  Try EVERYTHING because its ALL so very yummy!!  My favorite?  Vegetarian Taco and honey/powdered sugar fry bread.  Native owned and operated so you know you are getting the real deal!!"}
{"text":"I visit this business for the first time. 
Too many signs of  don't do's.  Ordered fry bread stuff with beans and ground beef, the menu price $6.79, at check out I was charged $8.31. I ask the cashier how did you get to $8.31, she responded \"I have to pay taxes, you can't buy and not pay taxes.\"
I should of walked away, but didn't.
To the lady cashier, you not only over charged me, the stuff fry bread needs more stuffing, taste like I had fry bread with no stuffing."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall, this place is great!  The portions are generous and the food is really flavorful.  We haven't had a bad meal yet, just a little messy."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Nothing fancy. The veggie tacos are the best I have found around here. The beef stew is great, & obviously home made not canned. Worth the reasonable prices. One of those veggie tacos will keep me full for a day usually. Better than other competitors offering fry bread. The other location is goo"}
{"text":"Don't listen to the reviews, it's expensive for what you get and its not real native food. 

It's good if you've never tasted the real thing and if you don't mind spending too much money for Refried beans."}
{"text":"So the food here is excellent.  The service is absolutely awful.  There's this kid at night who (after 2 months) still doesn't understand how to take an order.  We've been in 5 times in two months and he had screwed up every single order.  He also has this habit of arguing about what's on the menu!  It makes me want to go downtown just to avoid him. It literally takes five minutes to complete an order.  I cringe when I come here and he's working.  Please give him some training or hire someone competent.  Otherwise you'll lose a customer."}
{"text":"A couple of times in the last month I have gone here for lunch.  The fry bread here is very, very, good.  I love the crisp, brown, bubbly surface that makes these so addicting.  Both times the fry bread was served so hot I had to let it sit a couple of minutes before eating.

I had the red chili the first time and green the next.  They are both excellent but I really enjoyed the flavor of the hatch green chili in the green.  The beef itself is fall apart tender and quite flavorful in all those juices.  There is also a very nice, but not too spicy, hot sauce that enhances the flavor of the tacos.  Either way, there was so much filling in the fry bread I could only finish part with my hands.  Good thing there are plenty of paper towels!  Next time I hope to leave room for a honey topped fry bread for dessert and then drive immediately to the hospital before going home.

The ladies that work there are very quiet but nice.  You order at the counter and the food is brought out to you.  The decor is definitely no frills..but hey...this is fry bread not prime rib. 

Lastly, I really want to make this part of my bi-weekly restaurant rotation but I doubt I'd live to provide an update to this review.  What a way to go though!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh the deliciousness. I am so happy that they opened a Fry Bread House closer to where I live. I love, love, love Fry Bread House's food. I normally get the Indian tacos, but in an effort to branch out, I recently tried the combo tacos with green chili beef and beans. It was, as expected, incredible. A taco so large and overflowing that I cannot finish all of it (that's what the husband is for). And this location is much larger than the Phoenix location- hope it catches on in the east valley and stays around! I love not having to drive in to Phoenix for Indian tacos! Yummmm."}
{"text":"Not like the one on 7th Ave menudo, but fry bread was soooo good."}
{"text":"I'm always a little scared to try shopping center restuarants, but since this was recommended by people I trust, I took my mom and kids to try it out.  Boy was I glad I did!

First off, the fry bread.  You just can not go wrong with fried dough.  Every culture seems to have one and American Indian is no different.  The bread is crisp but chewy for the best combination of textures.

Fillings, get a taco, a fry bread cheese crisp, a dessert bread or (my recommendation) a bean and cheese fry bread.  It's not on the menu, but they do have bean and cheese burritos, so I asked for one.  Oh my was it good!  Their refried beans are so good made the right way (which probably means lots of calories, but oh well).  If you like bean and cheese burritos this is that and so much more.

The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is the decor.  I don't ask for much, but this is a cantina style restaurant where you order and then they call your name when it's done.  That doesn't bother me at all, but some of the booths need to be re-upholstered.  The one I sat in was split and the stuffings were coming out.  Didn't make it unbearable, just not very comfortable.

Love this place, try it out!"}
{"text":"Great fry bread, the portions are huge and everything tasted fresh. The service was great, the cashier and cook were both incredibly welcoming and friendly! Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They frybread is bluebird quality and the stew is on point! Always polite and welcoming. 
I'm from Seattle, and I will always come back for a taste of home"}
{"text":"Wow, right by my house, could walk and probably should have, haha. Have always meant to go and today finally did. Ordered the vegetarian taco and the chocolate and butter bread for dessert. While in line the very nice woman told us they may be leaving this month :( I am so sad, it was one of the most delicious meals I've ever had!!! So much flavor, and HUGE!!!! Well worth the money. So much food in fact, I had to ask for the dessert to go, tried it later and.....OMG!!!!! So delicious. I sure hope they stay!!!!! I may cry if they don't."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I do not post reviews very often.  This place deserves my review. The food is AMAZING and the services is amazing. The potions are large. I ordered the Indian taco and a been and cheese. Once it came out I realized I screwed up cause I was not going to be able to eat all of it. It is not expensive either. Very reasonably priced. The service was fast and everyone was polite. I highly recommend everyone to go here and try this place."}
{"text":"First visit. My wife and I with 2 friends. Food was awesome! Green beef Ultimate Indian Taco was excellent. Fry Bread with honey was great. The Chocolate and Butter desert fry bread was heavenly. Prices are reasonable. But the service at the order counter is extremely slow, slow, slow. People walked out behind us and again while we were eating. The line just wasn't moving. They really need to fix that one problem and put a second person on the order counter. Loved the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best fry bread on this side of town. I always get the green chili Indian taco! Always made fresh!! The staff are so friendly and welcoming also! Which makes the experience that much better!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I really do. However... What restaurant closes for an hour for the employees to have lunch? Are they not able to continuously provide service if the employees rotate their lunch breaks? Not to mention the door was unlocked and an employee was lying down in the booth. The others were at the tables eating. 
Another time we went in for dinner at about 6:15..and all the chairs were up on the tables.  The gentleman told us \"We close at 7.\" Um.... There was still 45 minutes. The same gentleman is never friendly when he takes our order. 
Anyway I'm sure we will return when we crave some of our Native food."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went for lunch last Saturday in Mesa and I can say that I am not a huge fan. I walked in to no electricity in the dining area. Stood  in line for quite a while to get to the front and have our order taken by a very unhappy person. So we both ordered a taco and I got a drink and the cost was almost $19! Then my drink was topped off with ice so after about 4 swallows I needed a refill. So then it was back in line for 10 minutes for a 70 cent refill while food got cold. If you need a napkin they have a roll of paper towels by the register and you can have ONE. And if you plan on getting it to go bring extra money to pay for your hot sauce. They really get every penny from you. The positive was the taco was good so since I am creative in the kitchen and love to cook I came home and researched the recipe from their tribe and re-created it perfectly. It was soooo easy!!! So now for penny's I can enjoy this any time with my own toppings :)"}
{"text":"I was pleased to find out about Fry Bread House East.  Not long ago I ventured to the original Fry Bread House in Phoenix and loved the food.  When I returned to Yelp to write it up I saw they had the East location in Mesa.  Happy to have great fry bread at a location that is more convenient for me.

They offer the same menu as the original restaurant.  Again I had the red chili beef Indian taco and, again, it was delicious.  At first glance the menu may appear pricey but the portions will leave you satisfied and stuffed.  Fry bread makes for a great taco base.  My only complaint is no free refills on the beverage and the cup is filled liberally with ice but, eh, I won't hold that against them.  The smaller mom and pop places need to find ways to make money and I'm sure this is a great saver for them.

On my next visit I have every intention of trying the desert style fry bread with the powdered sugar or chocolate sauce.

If you're in the east valley and looking to try something different, this is a place you need to check out."}
{"text":"So, it's not exactly the epitome of clean. And they are randomly closed sometimes (such as my birthday on Black Friday - sorry not a holiday unless you are a Wal-Mart camper). And the staff isn't exactly smile-your-pants-off friendly. 

But it's good. It's truly consistently good grub. Portions are large enough for 2 meals...but you will eat it all in one sitting (or try to) since you will have convinced yourself that the fry bread won't be as good reheated.

I'm still a bit bummed that my fry bread birthday tradition was hampered this year. 

Note: It's hidden in a sad Mesa strip mall, with easy parking since it appears to be one of the few businesses still in operation in the strip. Seating is worn but ample."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all.... And yes, my friends I know my fry bread. 
I had the combo... the meat was bland, the cheese was old, and the lettuce was wilted, not to mention that the bread was greasy (which it really shouldn't) and overcooked. 
I know that they're natives, as am I, maybe that was why I was expecting a little bit more \"wow\" since they opened a restaurant, but I left disappointed.
Nonetheless, I will not be coming back. For the price I paid I could've made better in my home, with tons more flavor."}
{"text":"I had their white menudo and it was fantastic.  I loved it.  I like their decor and and the people, and sometimes wonder when people complain about that.

This place is the real deal and comfort and feeling good are more important than what my eyes are looking at.  And the day I was there my eyes were looking at some great food and nice company.  Yeah!"}
{"text":"This place Is fantastic. Definitely not for you health nuts. Big portions at a great value. Don't be scared to get a little messy eating these things. Will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Delish! Good fry bread is a rare unicorn and this place is on point! The green chile taco was great!!"}
{"text":"Great food! So gald they have a location in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I came here for the  first time this week and had the best service.  I got the ultimate Fry bread taco whixh was beyond delicious and also got a dessert Fry bread to share.  It had butter and chocolate and omg..  It was so good.  I will definitely be going back for more soon."}
{"text":"I think my mother makes the best fry bread but this place works in a pinch.  We've been going to both locations for awhile and can be counted on for it's consistency.  Try the tortillas and green chile hominy stew.  I find it surprising when people complain about greasy fry bread because I think the name itself implies what you can expect.  I give it a four for food and food quality alone but I'm not looking for a tremendous dining experience when I get there."}
{"text":"Amazing frybread taco! Got the red chili with beans combo. Must try :0) great service. Took the cashiers recommendation of the red chili frybread with beans which is her favorite."}
{"text":"Cool artwork, very much a diner. The food is spicy and the bread is yummy, definitely a five for food."}
{"text":"Awesome traditional food. Reasonably priced. I get the Ultimate Taco Red. Here's some bullshit babble to appease Yelps stupid robots."}
{"text":"Best in class. Whether stopping by for a honey covered fry bread or a great green chile indian taco this place is hard to beat. We stop by every chance we get."}
{"text":"This is a fun family owned restaurant to go check out and the food is pretty tasty as well. Reminds me of going to the swap meet or one of those local food markets and getting some fry bread for a treat.

Always used to get the standard fry bread with powdered sugar and just recently realized they make them with all sorts of goodies sprinkled on top or stuffed inside. Not sure how healthy these puppies are but who cares when you are craving one or two and just can't resist.

Ordered the Chili Beef Combo Taco on my first visit and was not disappointed. Came back later in the week and tried both the Red & Green Chili Stew. Used a side of Fry Bread to sop it up all the gravy. The flavors are very nice and there is some spicy heat to make your mouth wanting more.

Next my wife goes out of town and I was feeling lazy. No kidding. Stopped in and picked up two containers of both Red Chili and Green Chile Taco meat - To Go. Just warmed up some tortillas and applied some meat and ate like a champ for the next couple nights.

Service is counter style and there is plenty of room inside for larger groups. Looking forward to trying out some of their fancy sweet choices on my next visit. As Arnold says in his movies ... I'LL BE BACK!

{"text":"Very nice play on fry bread. I had the green chile fry bread and it was some of the best green chile i have ever had. My girlfriend had there signature chocolate fry bread and it was okay. I recomend to try"}
{"text":"If you have not tried this place, you really should.. As soon as possible ! Authentic Fry bread tacos, crazy delicious stews you eat with fry bread.  This is a rare gem of a place.  The staff is friendly and really helpful!
So far I have tried ground beef and red chili fry bread tacos, hominy stew and red chili stew.  All are amazing comfort food.  The deserts are also incredible.  The chocolate and butter fry bread is just ridiculous.  
The only knock there could be is the location and decor but once you start eating none if that will matter.  The restaurant is owned and operated by Tohono O'odham tribe members so you know your are getting authentic Sonoran Native fare."}
{"text":"For me it's the simple things.  The simple things done very well.  And employees who actually, genuinely seem happy to see customers.  Imagine that.  (Take note Sprouts employees...you grouchy fockers).  

I was the only person in the joint today around 11:30 and got myself a ground beef taco, a Coke, and a cinnamon and sugar fry bread for dessert.  I LOVED that the young man working the register asked me if I'd like to get the cinn & sug fry bread a little later.  Why yes I would!  For 2 reasons.  If you give it to me with my taco, I will eat all of it first and the taco will get cold.  Second, I made myself eat about a third of the taco, enjoying every bite, and saving room for my dessert, which was warm and cinnamoney and sugary and delicious!  

Delicious is the word of the day for this place.  I enjoyed every aspect of my meal, and I was glad to see the place start to fill up as I was leaving.  I will try to be more adventurous next time and get something with stronger flavors, but I LOVE simple beef tacos.  For me they are comfort food, and this was a great one.  Go check them out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"If I knew I wasn't going to die from eating there constantly I probably would say it's worth it. But alas, it's definitely a once every 6 months type of eat out."}
{"text":"So I drive to place because it says open until 7 pm on a Saturday and when I get there doors locked. I called and they answered saying yes the are open but closing at 4:30 and it's 3:45. I may only live in Tempe so I didn't drive out my way to much but I was very disappointed thinking I was going be able to try some of their food when I could I have went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sometimes it is worth the guilt. 
Well that is what I try to convince myself when I devour my meal. 
I am glad there is a location out in the easy valley, otherwise I have to drive all the way to central Phoenix. It is owned and operated by Tohono O'odham natives, yay for local eateries 

In my opinion this place at least has decent Native American fare. I usually opt for the vegetable beef stew with the frybread (Joedd Special). 12oz of stew and big hot frybread isn't so bad for $7. The frybread isn't fluffy and melt in your mouth per se. Rather is a slightly crunchy but oh so yummy item. I love the salsa they have on house as well. Other specialties I have tried are the red chili taco and th taco bowl. I love both as well, but will opt for the stew most of the time. 
They have varieties of indian tacos, stews, and tamales and such. They even have a kid's menu as well. 

This place isn't for the faint of heart, if one is trying to eating quite healthy...good luck. I, myself, am a nutrition student, but you have to have good food once in awhile."}
{"text":"Good authentic food, I love fry bread and this place does not skimp, good food, good price. Nothing spicy here but they do offer a mild 'salsa' that is pretty good. 

They also offer tamales and treats which I will have to try next time since my vegetarian taco was just too much for me to eat in one sitting!"}
{"text":"Finally found a place that the FIL, hubs and I can all agree upon: a Tohono O'oodham Native American family owned hole-in-the-wall serving up delicious, gigantic Indian Fry Bread! It is fluffy, addictive, and truly huge; we'll go back and I'll try the cinnamon, but this is a very rare treat for us. 

The fellas like the Indian tacos: Ultimate, Red ChilI or Green Chili; I had the vegetarian loaded with Hatch Chiles, refried beans, cheese, lettuce, onions with sour cream on the side. Portions are tremendous: I cut mine in half, and had enough for a second meal later. They also serve stews with Fry Bread on the side to sop up the gravy, and quite an extensive menu. 

I'm sure we will be back, the Fry Bread is made to order, so it takes a few minutes, but is absolutely a wait rewarded. Such a treat to have this place available nearby, serving delicious family recipes lovingly handed down through generations. Previously I'd only had the chance to taste Fry Bread at Pow Wows, and FBH is lightyears better than any I've had before. Such a fan! 

* HUGE fluffy Fry Bread *

** cooked to order **

*** sweet & savory options ***

**** worth the artery clogging ***"}
{"text":"Me and my spouse regularly stop here at FBH. The owners are very kind and prompt to take down our orders. My personal favorite is the combination green chile beef Indian taco, freshly made chips and homemade salsa.

One of the most filling plates I can think of for $6-7. The first time we went in, we ordered two Indian tacos and a bowl of delicious posole and an extra fry bread. Needless to say, we took half of it home!

Can't recommend a better place locally for some freshly prepared food with great portions and value. (Not the usual crap you find at the local McD's or Subway)"}
{"text":"Great little place w/great frybread. Tried the Chorizo Frybread Taco & Hominy Stew. Both  were flavorful & delicious. The chorizo was very spicy, no need for extra hot sauce. A new little spot for me to frequent since moving to Phoenix last year. Can't wait to try other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Server recommended the Chorizo, Ultimate, Cheese Melt, and the Chocolate butter and everything was delicious! Great service and attention. My mom sister and I enjoyed our experience here!"}
{"text":"Yum. I had a green chile fried ultimate taco. My wife had a red chile fried ultimate taco. We are coming back. I recommend the red, which got less reviews than the green. Why??

We also had a dessert taco. Yummy."}
{"text":"The Indian Taco with ground beef was very good - almost as good as those I used to enjoy at Sacaton.  However, the chocolate and butter dessert frybread was absolutely out of this world!!!!!  The restaurant was clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful.   I will definitely be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. I wasn't sorry I did.

The service is okay. It's the family operating it and they take your order at the counter and bring the food to you. You get drinks refill but they keep it behind the counter so you have to bug them everytime. 

I got the red chili beef and honey and sugar fry breads. The red chili beef was good, I liked the flavors but it was very greasy. It's a good size and my boyfriend and I shared one. The fry bread is flaky and has a good flavor on its own. The honey and sugar was delicious too. They're generous with their portions. I shared the dessert as well and we both walked out stuffed. 

It's a good place around the corner for a quick fry bread fix but if I'm really craving it, I think I'll head to another place."}
{"text":"First - A few things I think we can all agree on about the Fry Bread House (East)

Yes its kind of a hole.
Yes they are stingy with their soda (50 cent refills... really?)
Yes their staff can be a little....  independent

Now something folks might disagree on about the Fry Bread House (East):
They serve the best fry bread on earth and deserves a 5 star rating even if they decide that folks in line need to be regularly beaten.

I've had fry bread from all over this state.  You can get it at the state fair, various restaurants, roadside stalls, a yellow school-bus in the parking lot of Mazatzal casino, there's even a guy in mesa who sells it out of his driveway.  None of it compares to what they sell here - its just stunningly good.

Get a \"Taco\"  for lunch and then get a sweet one for desert - you can buy em both at the same time they'll toss the desert one in whenever you ask."}
{"text":"On my way home from work and I pass this place everyday. I always wanted to try it so I thought today's the day. I ordered the Ultimate Taco which is fry bread filled with meat, beans, chili, lettuce,cheese, and sour cream. It was delicious. They have many different toppings for the fry bread savory as well as sweet. They also have burritos and tacos.  The lady that waited on me was very nice.  Quick service as well. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So yummy! Great massive Indian fry bread. Had the red chili one. The red chili was very good. The fry bread was also yummy on it's own. Very satisfied & will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good! If you're craving fry bread, this is the place to get it. And yes, real Indians are working there! Its very fresh. The only complaint is that they charge you for extra honey. The hours aren't great either. But its good weather it is dessert or lunch time!"}
{"text":"Great Fry Bread.  I had the chorizo but had food envy when I tasted my husband's green chilies taco.  The highlight for me was the cinnamon and sugar desert fry bread.  Here the fry bread really shines. Fry Bread House East was very clean and the folks who helped us were friendly and fast.  I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I tried an Indian Taco, Fry Bread plain & Fry Bread with Honey & Powdered Sugar.  The beans in the Indian Taco were the effing bomb.  Since moving to AZ I have found that most places here cannot make a pot of beans to save themselves.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I might have a problem with waiting too long to write reviews for places I really enjoy. Another one bites the dust: Goodbye, Fry Bread House East! 

I had a solid \"love/hate\" relationship with FBHEast. I loved the delicious indulgent fried food here but my body absolutely would shut down into a full-on food coma afterwards. Plans would need to be crossed of the schedule because a good hard nap was needed for a full food coma recovery. It was well worth any food struggles that had to be endured, but only once in a while for special occasions, of course.

Don't worry the Phoenix location still stands! Hooray! So if a fixin' for fluffy fried bread topped savory or sweet (or both) hits, a quick trip to the heart of the Valley will satisfy those cravings."}
{"text":"The chips are fresh fried per order. The salsa was tasty but a little spicy for my liking. The strip mall where this is located looked a little sketchy due to reno's and the inside is super plain and outdated but the food was great. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was clean. This is the closest thing I have found to San Antonio style puffy tacos since moving to AZ from TX. You order your food at the counter and then sit and they bring it out to you. Will definitely go back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was my first time at the FBH and I was craving stew with frybread
Since I was in the area, I thought I would stop in and get some 
The service was just okay, the guy behind the counter was helpful but not very nice 
He was brief and choppy, if that makes sense
This joint is owned and operated by Tohono Oodham natives and they have another one located in central Phoenix...
I ordered the hominy stew with a Frybread 
Joedd special apparently
I also got a cup for water and the guy handed me a cup with ice without telling me where the water was... I searched around for a bit and finally found it, it's the small spicket near the ordering station... 
My food didn't take too long as I am sure the stew was warmed up and frybread usually doesn't take long as well... The stew itself was really good, my only complaint was the size of the bowl-for the price... But other than that, I enjoyed it...
The frybread was a lot crunchier than I like... I ended up eating more of the outside and working my way towards the center which was crunchy... That part I left on the plate... 

All in all it was good to experience the FBH East and perhaps I will try the FBH in Central Phoenix..."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since my initial visit.

The food has stayed decidedly mediocre. If you've got a craving for fry bread this place will fill the need. The variety of toppings is good if uninspired. 

I haven't had a \"bad\" meal here, but nothing brings this place to mind unless I'm already craving fry bread."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good fry bread tacos. Really cheap too. It's kind of a catch-22, the inside of this place is run down and a little dirty but if you get your food to go then it will probably be too soggy to eat by the time you get home. It is really good, really filling. Authentic. Definitely worth trying and coming back."}
{"text":"Love the FRY BREAD HOUSE!! So darn good!!! I get the red chili taco, I salivate typing the words out! So good! We usually get to go. There is a really nice friendly young man cooking in the back that always is a pleasure to work with. Makes us feel welcome and our business appreciated. Give it a try, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came in here back when they first opened and I was in town. I really enjoyed the Fry Bread Taco , as did my daughter. This has become one of my \"be sure to visit\" places in Mesa on consequent trips. 

I stopped in yesterday and was definitely not disappointed. The Indian Taco was huge and I only intended to eat half of it but it was pretty full and messy and the delicious insides kept tumbling out so I got a spoon and kept taking bites. I knew the fry bread would lose the wonderful crispness if I were to eat  it later and I hadn't eaten all day so I finished the whole thing and, while comfortable, was full the rest of the evening. This place is definitely worth seeking out and trying. I look forward to returning next trip.

Oh, and there is a huge parking lot since it is in the strip mall so you can park right in front."}
{"text":"Ok so it's no secret... I'm not a big fan of the Native foods that I've tried since coming to the Phoenix area.  It's either too bland or too spicy or too greasy or.. ((sigh))  Anyway, I keep trying different places and this time, I found something that I'd consider reordering... the spicy red chili stew.  It was simple, but good.  

I might come back... if I had a friend in town who wanted to try Native American food.  That's more than I can say for the other 2 Native locations I've tried.  :)

The service here was also friendlier than the other places.  Not friendly... just friendlier. haha

Might see ya there."}
{"text":"So good. Authentic & affordable. We're lucky to have a real, locally owned fry bread house so close to home. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list for a very long time.  I love Fry Bread and someone recommended this place, but because it's all the way in Mesa, it's taken me a while to finally try it out.  A few colleagues and I came here for lunch and ordered a Cheese Crisp and an Ultimate (Red Sauce, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomatoes).

The Cheese Crisp was huge!  It was about 30% larger than a normal Cheese Crisp.  We almost got full on that alone.  

They make the Fry Bread fresh to order here, so it took a while to get ours.  I couldn't wait to bit into it....when I did, it didn't disappoint.  It was awesome!  So much flavor and very filling.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Really good place. I had the red chili ultimate taco. Hubby had the green. The red was really good, but the green was a bit more flavorful to me. It's a bit worn inside and located in a tired strip mall. The food is good and I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"So, so far since we have entered the restaurant and placed our order, our experience is less than spectacular. You walk in and the decor is home-y. The Native American paintings hanging on the walls are a nice touch. 
We placed our order after another family, but yet, it took us 10 minutes of waiting at the counter to finally be acknowledged by the \"gentleman\" behind the counter. I guess that's just that \"Native\" attitude. Mind you, I'm Native American and grew up on the reservation. My wife and I ordered the Combination Taco and my wife simply asked if they could add onions and cheese (she didn't notice that it in fact came with cheese), and the guy became annoyed and shot back an attitude-filled response. I'm thinking this happened because we too are Native American and he seems to maybe not like natives, because right after us was a couple of Anglos and he gave them the utmost courtesy. Because of him, this place gets 3*. The food on the other-hand was actually pretty decent. The fry bread was fluffy and scrumptious, the beans tasted like it was out of a can (BOO!) and it had a nice little spice to it (YAY!) We might possibly return."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying that I have never had fry bread before (or Indian food in general) and I am a very picky eater. I went here with a friend, who ordered fry bread with just beans and cheese on it. I don't even like beans, but she had me try it and I ate the entire piece she gave me...and wanted more! I also ordered a dessert one with powdered sugar on it and I thought that was pretty good as well. Coming from someone who doesn't like to try new foods, I would definitely come back to this place and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much, but OMG. All you need to know is: chocolate and butter fry bread. I know my fry bread and their tacos lack the grease that off the res places slather their tacos in. This place has light and crispy tacos that are amazing. It's a stunner."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews and local postings, I have been wanting to try this place for years.  We finally got the chance!  

Downside:  1) Hours and 2) if you are a clean freak, you may be put off by the no-frills atmosphere.

Upside:  My 9YO and my 5YO wanted to come back the next morning for breakfast.  My husband said it's the best fry bread he's ever had (outside of grandma's, of course), and I devoured my taco.

We tried the stew, two of the kid's meals, and the Ultimate Taco (red chile).  It was amazing.  My 9YO ate a little bit of everyone's meal, it was soooo good!

So, don't let the store front appearance scare you off.  This ISN'T that fair fry bread -- it's the real deal!"}
{"text":"Super sweet people working there and excellent customer service. The hot sauce was absolutely delicious. It wasn't very spicy but very flavorful! The red chili beef was cooked perfectly. Overall it was a good experience and I would like to try other varieties. The bean and cheese version was a bit bland and my serving was luke warm. I am curious to try the vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Good , not absolutely wonderful .. But good . Good prices.   I've made these at home and they taste the exact same , no special flavors unless u order the red chili one ... Didn't really care for the flavor of the red chili, I liked just the regular one with ground beef. 
I would go back , but only if I were in the area.  Still on the hunt for a better Fry bread ;)"}
{"text":"Great eats! Love the fry bread tacos they have a good flavor great toppings always fresh always ready when ordered.

The only downside here is their hours. If they were open later I would enjoy this restaurant far more often."}
{"text":"This is located less than a 1/4 mile from my new office and was recommended by a friend of mine, so I had to try it.  I have eaten here twice and both times I got the Ultimate Taco with red chile beef.  

The restaurant is a bit austere, but clean.  I had no problem finding a clean table at lunch time.  You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table.   

The Ultimate Taco is enough to satisfy my big appetite.  It is pretty big.  Wearing dress clothes, I did not dare try to pick it up and eat it for fear of getting red chile all over my clothes, so I ate it with the plastic knife and fork provided.  

I am not a fry bread connoisseur, but I thought it was delicious and not too greasy.  The red chile beef is good, but I would like it a whole lot spicier.  (I like VERY spicy food.)

Fry Bread House is a once every couple of weeks treat for me and it is now in my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for soooooo long, and I was in the area and figured I'd stop in before I went in to work. It's tucked in to a nice shopping center and I walked in and was a little surprised at how big it was. There's a lot of seating and the inside was nice and clean. I knew that I wanted a navajo taco but I wasn't aware that there were so many options! I had the ground beef taco (can't remember specifics), waited for a few minutes, and was on my way. 

First of all, it was HUGE. I had no idea it would be so big, but it was definitely worth $7 I spent on it. It was very filling, that's for sure. I had half of it, the ingredients were fresh, the beef wasn't spectacularly seasoned but it was good nonetheless. I'm not sure if I'd return for a meal, but I definitely want to go back for dessert....mmMMmm"}
{"text":"I like taking out of town visitors here to get something real that isn't from a chain restaurant.  Whenever they come back this is the first place they want to go back to.  I like supporting local businesses like this and will continue to do so.  They just need to be open longer, sometimes I eat dinner late and they are already closed."}
{"text":"This place is all about the food, like me!
I come here a lot in between classes. I haven't ever seen it crowded, which is surprising because I have a wonderful food experience every time I come here! The people who work here never get my order wrong & they most always have a smile. AND THE FRYBREADS. Oh glob the frybreads are always so amazing."}
{"text":"Really Yummy, We went to Fry Bread House on Saturday 5/16/2015 about noon. We have 2 very large teenage sons who just got off of football practice and a 3 yr old so we ordered off both the regular and kids menu. My husband and 2nd son got the green chili pork supreme my oldest got the red chili ground beef, I got the shredded beef green chili pork and my 3 yr old got the been and cheese from the kids menu. After my 2 older boys demolished their meal they ordered the honey/powdered sugar dessert fry bread and demolished that as well. The kids menu is super cute, I ordered the popcorn frybread for my 3 yr old to snack on while waiting for our meal the very sweet gentlemen working in the kitchen came out with the popcorn almost immediately, I ate a few :) they were so cute and very yummy.....HOWEVER when my lil 3 yr old noticed his big brothers had eaten all the popcorn frybread (luckily he didn't notice until after we all finished) he started crying so we cleaned up and started to head out my husband went to order one of the popcorn frybread for my lil one To-Go and the lady behind the counter said it was for DINE-IN only.....My husband said ok then we'll order it and ask you for a to-go plate and I can put it in the container myself since my lil one is crying and it would be good customer service since we just spent about $60-$70 for lunch...she was adamant and said \"Well, the owner says its her policy because then no one will order a full dessert since the popcorn is only $2\"....I didn't see how much the honey/powered sugar dessert cost but I can't imagine its more than $3 or $4. Unfortunately my family and I are HUGE on Customer Service (as we should be since we use our hard earned money to ENJOY what we spend that $ on) so we will NOT be coming back to Fry Bread House. I can't knock the product its great!!!! Really yummy! But again Customer Satisfaction is important to us and we were really bothered and upset that the lady behind the counter didn't give a crap about Customer Satisfaction."}
{"text":"Indian fry bread is addictively  tasty stuff, for all that it was invented by 19C Indians out of the flour they got as government rations.  At this utilitarian lunch counter place, the typical meal is a big round piece of it with a big scoop of meat stew on top.  I got the green chile.  It was the reddest-colored green chile I'd ever seen, but the server confirmed I'd gotten what I ordered, and the red chile is merely redder still.

And fast.  I was in and out in less than 20 minutes, on a day when time was pressing."}
{"text":"Finally they have another native american eating joint on the east side!!  The one on Gilbert was great but ended up closing.  I'm not worries about the fry bread because i know it will be good.  Was more concerned on whether they would have native style stews, and boy do they!  They have about 5 different varieties from red chili stew to menudo.  I decided to try the hominy with beef, a very simple stew but this one bowl is pretty filling.  Most native style stews are pretty simple,  just beef with various vegetables and not much herbs.  But that's what makes them good!  Simple comfort food.  I plan on trying the red chili or menudo on my next visit.  They fry bread for me was okay.  You need the oil at a certain temperature for the bread to come out right.  You get a nice softness and crunch in one serving.  Mine was still a little oily in certain area but since i wasn't concerned with my diet today, i didn't mind the greasiness.  The place is quite cozy with little pieces of artwork on the walls.  Miss the nice native music that the other place had.  Can't wait to visit again.  Keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"Who needs the AZ state fair when you have this place! I was craving an Indian taco so badly and was getting ready to drive all the way to the state fair to get one until I checked Yelp to see if there were any places in the valley that might have them. Sure enough I found this place and convinced my fiancé to check it out. So glad we did! We had the green chili beef combo Indian taco and it was so delish! Definitely recommend this place. It was a bit of a drive for us but very well worth it. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Giving 2 stars because the customer service was just horrible. Yes we came in 30 min before they close but when someone walks thru the door and automatically says \"we close at 7 so all orders are to go!\" Is not too welcoming. As soon as we ordered no lie another 8 people came in and yelled the same thing to them as well. There should definitely be some training in how to talk like an adult and not so rude. Gonna give the food a try and hope it doesn't match their attitudes. Which were horrible. Maybe think about staying open a little later."}
{"text":"Love the simplicity of the food and how its transformed into something so delicious!  Sometimes bean/cheese on some fry bread is all a girl needs to get through the day! Oh, and their hot sauce is bomb! 
Great prices and way better than any any drive thru fast good joint. 

P.s They are closing this location soon and moving out to Phoenix! Get it close to home while you can! You know you love some powered sugar fry bread...dont lie to yourself!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there tonight for dinner and it was wonderfully delicious.  

We spoke to the staff and they were very friendly.  Gave us a brief history of the original store and answered all our questions.  

This was my Husband's first time eating fry bread and I believe he's hooked now because he said he definitely would be going back to eat and try something else.  

The bread was huge and folded over like a taco.  Everything tasted perfect even at closing time.  I can't wait to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Great First Time Fry Bread Experience

I've been in Arizona for over 15 years and have never had Native American Fry Bread. Everyone I know who has had it swears that it is great stuff. Tuesday, I decided it was past time for me to have the experience. I went to Fry Bread House East because it was conveniently located, and had more favorable than unfavorable ratings.

I had a great experience! Thankfully, they were not at all busy when I arrived around noon. The cashier took lots of time with me explaining the menu, and helping me decide what kind of fry bread to try. I opted for savory rather than sweet and settled on the red chili beef Ultimate Taco. That was fry bread made into a taco with refried beans, red chili beef, onions, sour cream, shredded cheese, and lettuce.

Although the fry bread is made to order, my food came out quickly. The portion was HUGE (larger than the paper plate) and delicious. I only could eat a small fraction of it, but loved every bite. I've decided that I'll make the trip there a few more times so that I can try other fry bread preparations. I'm a fry bread fan now!

As an aside, Fry Bread House East isn't much from a décor perspective, and at a glance, doesn't appear to be open because of the construction next door. It's worth visiting anyway for the food!"}
{"text":"Meh. Decent. Mexican food on fried bread, if you can picture that. Still, it was good, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Thanks to Manny S., I gave this non-chain restaurant a try on my last trip to Phoenix. I suppose their food is a mashup of both Mexican and Native American and the main thing they have on their menu are the tacos with the Indian Fry Bread. This was the first time I've had Indian Fry Bread and the only way I know how to describe it is that it's similar to a chaloupa, but fluffier, tastier and about 5 times bigger than any other chaloupa I've ever had. They are stuffed with really moist, tender and amazingly flavored meat. I chose the Green Chili Beef Taco which was shredded beef (EXCELLENT flavor), that was topped with green sauce, lettuce and cheese. I enjoyed every single bite I took. The taco was huge (check out the pics; they are pretty much the size of the plates) and I didn't think I would be able to finish it but it was just that damn good that I had every last bite. 

FBH also serves their bread as a dessert. I got a Chocolate & Butter Fry Bread which is basically a plain piece of bread that comes with chocolate and butter as dipping sauces. I was pretty much topped off after eating the beef taco so I got the dessert fry bread to go. I should have known it was a bad idea because even though I nuked it in the microwave for a little while, it just didn't taste the same as the fresh bread. I'm sure it would have been great had I eaten it fresh. 

This Fry Bread House is a simple, spacious, non-decorative restaurant with many tables and booths. The customer service was good, they serve Coke products and also have a restroom inside. I can't even describe how painful it was for me to write this review because I can't even go and get a taco from Fry Bread House, you know, with the fact that I live thousands of miles away and all. You better believe I'll be back to FBH again the next time I'm in Phoenix. Thanks again for the excellent suggestion Manny!"}
{"text":"The food is yummy. I would recommend anything with the red chile. Also, they have the elusive red cream soda. 


If it were just the food, we'd be sitting at 4 stars. The knock here comes from the stickiness of the tables and the grumpy staff."}
