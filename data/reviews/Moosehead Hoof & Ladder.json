{"text":"my daughter and I had lunch here yesterday after a long trip. We are here before when we were buying a home and enjoyed it but yesterday was not. To the point, I don't think we will be back. It was a bit crowed and I understood it was a holiday. We sat down at 1:30 and didn't get our app until 2:20. Waiters apologized but didn't see her again till our food came 30 more mins later. UNREAL. Again she disappeared, no refills and food was cooked with onions when we told her none please. We were told when they got in a hurry they cook it all together. What? So it doesn't matter that we didn't want them? So my daughter couldn't eat it. We weren't ask if she would like anything else nothing. Then I had to get another waitress to get our check. I could see ours standing in the kitchen talking. Unreal. And when we got the check no discount nothing taken off. It was unbelievable. Ask for manager we waited ten minutes, no one. So we left. Pretty sure we will not be back."}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times over the years and it never seems to disappoint.  A converted fire house, it is beautifully covered wall-to-wall with warm, honey wood paneling.  An authentic fire hose tower and some neat artifacts and photos on the walls.  There are two cozy bar areas in the front and rear of the building.  Plenty of booths and window views.  Moosehead is located in the quaint little train stop village of Olmsted Falls, only a few minutes from I-480, so it is really pretty convenient from the highway.    We've been there in the winter and found the atmosphere to be warm and inviting , and the food is equal to the venue.  Nothing spectacular, but that isn't what Moosehead sets out to be.  The menu is vast, yet there are some unique items that make the food memorable.  All of the traditional burgers, chicken sandwiches, nachos, fish & chips,etc, are there, but they also offer Buffalo Egg Rolls, some unique nacho plates, and very cool salads. Oh, and don't forget the awesome homemade potato chips served with most entrees.   A nice beer selection on tap and in bottles.    Perhaps the most impressive thing about this place is dining outdoors on the patio in the warmer weather.  The view over the river valley is inspiring--you would think you are somewhere in a national park, looking down a hundred feet to the rolling river below.  Tables with umbrellas take advantage of the summer evening shade from the side of the building, providing a pleasant outdoor dining experience in all but the most extreme weather conditions.  Yes, it can get busy on weekends, but do what we did last Saturday--arrive around 5:00 p.m. or so--before the typical dinner rush, and sit outside sipping cocktails and enjoying an early dinner!  Lovely.    We've always found the service to be bright and cheerful, if not always top shelf.  Prices are reasonable for pub fare and this is certainly a kid-friendly establishment. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food in a great atmosphere.  The old firehouse decor is really neat.  They also have great Christmas decor around the holidays.  My favorites are the chili, barbecue pulled pork (Porky) and I always upgrade to their delicious seasoned french fries!  This is our favorite place in Olmsted Falls, OH!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I enjoyed our meals the other day at Moosehead's!  She got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and homemade chips and I got the Turkey Burger with coleslaw.  I did find something hard that I couldn't chew in my coleslaw (not edible), but I know these things do happen here and there.  All-in-all, a nice outing and we would go back."}
{"text":"Anyone with a passion for fire fighting equipment and nostalgia will love this place.  Parking can be scarce, and on numerous occasions I've experienced a very long wait for a table, sometimes close to an hour.  I find the menu entirely too big and too hard to read.  Frequent spelling mistakes and the font/handwriting they've used on it is terribly frustrating to read.  That being said, they do offer a lot of options, all of which I've tasted were very good and highly recommended.  Of all the people I've visited with, we have nothing but great things to say about the food.  Service admittedly has been hit and miss.  But generally on the positive side.  Make sure you get there early for parking and a table, and bring your reading glasses for the menu."}
{"text":"A few problems with tonight's visit. Our waitress took our drink orders and then disappeared for 10-15 minutes. I wanted her to return to our table for a couple of reasons. One we wanted to be able to place our order and two I wanted my daughters and my Sprite replaced because they were both flat and awful tasting. I finally got our drinks replaced and our order in.  The place was slightly busy so I knew our order would take a while. No big deal. The problem came when my son who ordered a burger medium got his medium-well. He didn't want to complain because it took so long to get our food and he was hungry.   Now another complaint I would have with a place like this. I substituted fries for the chips. When my food came I got one very very small cup of ketchup. Not enough for fries and a burger. My son who also ordered a burger didn't even get ketchup with his and we were forced to ask for another very very small cup of ketchup. I don't like it when you go out to eat and they can't seem to just put a bottle of ketchup at your table.  So we got done with our meal and then sat around a good ten minutes for our waitress to come around and take the empty plates from our table.   She brought our bill and didn't give me time to hand it back to her before she bolted the table. So you know what that means, we had to wait yet again for her to come back and take my credit card.  My wife who drove from work told me that she had to get out of there and left.   I finally got my card back paid and left.    Needless to say I was about as disappointed as I could be with our overall experience. I'll be taking a long break before ever coming back here."}
{"text":"Food is great, decor is awesome, i recommend."}
{"text":"As an out of Towner ..Food was good the view from the patio is neat. Nice stop on a road trip to break it up.  Good service."}
{"text":"Just walked out after sitting at my table for over 20 minutes and not even having my drink order taken.  Seems like a nice place with a nice view but the service is seriously lacking.  I had high hopes :("}
{"text":"I like this place quite a bit- the service is decent, and the food is really good.  I love the turkey moose-ini, and the buffalo chicken salad, and their homemade chips and dip are really great.  There is usually always a wait when we go, but this past Saturday we went at 7pm and got a table for 4 with no wait at all, highly unusual.  I ordered the grilled steak salad just to try something different, and I would never order it again- that is the first and only time I have had a bad meal there.  The steak was really tough and had more fat on it than I would have liked, but it wasn't enough for me to write the place off at all."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers cooked perfectly, great atmosphere wonderful service.  Nice selection on the menu, reasonably priced, assortment of beers and mixed drinks ."}
{"text":"We ordered the seafaring nachos with drinks at the bar. Good flavor but seriously lacking in chunks of seafood and the lobster sauce was more a béchamel rather than having a good lobster flavor.  That being said, the staff was friendly, it was well decorated and cozy. Others in our party say that they have excellent homemade fries and chips. We would definitely return to try those, as well as sit out on the patio and enjoy view."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best wings around! Had lunch there end of February, on a Sunday. It's hard to please all four of us. We were all happy when we left. Now that's a great restaurant. Always clean, always good service, always good food."}
{"text":"Few options in Olmsted falls but man the service is so slow here even when they are not busy. Went today on a Sunday not very busy at all we were a party of 7 and were sat right away but we waited over 30 minutes for lunch. We would have been better off driving to north Olmsted or strongsville and would have been home an hour earlier."}
{"text":"Regular return trips to the area (we were married at the church next door years ago and family/friends are local) have identified MH&L as a \"go to\" stop for drinks and food.  Great atmosphere, a building with character, very clean and eclectic, this is a hang-out place. Lake perch is the typical choice for most of our guests who, as first-timers rave about the dinner, although I prefer sautéed. Fish & chips, sandwiches, outstanding New England clam chowder, and excellent onion rings are standards that will not disappoint. This is not necessarily fine dining, it is dining with friends in a relaxed, comfortable environment. Service has always been consistently above average and friendly. Great place for a wedding party dinner! Wide beer selection and a passable Bloody Mary extend the evening.  Parking is available and additional parking is still free."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there yesterday...good experience.  I had meatloaf and mashed potatoes and the potatoes were the real deal...not from a box.  We are planning a very important event in their party room in the spring and so far it has been a good experience.  I love that Moosehead offers Veterans a 25% discount off their bill everyday.  The facility is clean and comfortable...the music is a little loud for my taste though:)."}
{"text":"Recent disappointing visit. Weather was fine and was hoping to sit on the patio, when requested apparently it was \"closed due to weather\"...? Whatever. It was sunny out, I don't mind somewhat wet seats, dry them off.  Anyway, we were pretty hungry and decided to come here since its been a while. Sat down to a ridiculously sticky table. I hate that.   The menu appeared shortened. I was REALLY looking forward to ordering the Triple Decker Club, as that has been my go to meal each time I visit either location. I thought maybe I glanced over the menu since I wasn't finding it. Reading the menu carefully 5 times over I was slowly starting to lose any will to live. Nothing else really appealed to me and didn't want anything else but the TDC. The server confirmed it was no longer available. Which is odd, because they had the turkey, the ham, the bacon, the LTM, so just because it isn't on the menu why can't it still be made!? Really aggravating.   I settled on the Moosehead Burger - medium, my partner wanted the Melwood - medium rare.   Took a while to get out. When they arrived the chips seemed too well done. I love the chips, just don't like them cold and well done and feeling like my teeth will break and my mouth cut up.   Burgers not cooked to specification. Wasn't going to say anything. My medium was well done, still edible and not special. The Melwood was medium going into medium well. We were hungry and just wanted to get going, didn't really make an issue over mediocre food. Wasn't that bad, just really disappointing.   Don't feel the urge to return unless the triple Decker is added back on the menu. Still salty about that. Are there EVER any managers there? I never see any managers go table to table at either location. Must be why the food and service stink."}
{"text":"Moosehead Hook & Ladder is a great addition to Olmsted Falls.  Opened on May 8 2008 in a renovated fire house, Moosehead offers an EXTREMELY long and diverse menu consisting of salads, sandwiches, pub-style appetizers, burgers, and a few entrees.  If the bustling crowd on a Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm is any indication, it's a hit with the locals.  The generous roast beef and cheddar sandwich, served hot on giant soft roll, is served with au jus dipping sauce.  A sandwich that would sound closely related - the French Onion steak sandwich - is actually pretty distinct.  This deconstructed version of the classic soup is served on thick white toast, with provolone cheese melted on TOP of the top slice of toast.  Chunks of slightly tough steak, cooked to order, is within.  All of this is dipped in a cup of french onion broth.  We'd pass on the potato skins - we ordered the \"basic\" cheese and bacon model and they weren't anything special.  Maybe we should have taken them up on loading them with lobster, shrimp and crabmeat for the seafood edition.  Every sandwich is served with deliciously thick hand-cut potato chips and house-made onion dip (reminiscent of Lawson's).  These were really a hit with our group... don't miss the chips.  There were a few snafus from the very friendly service - silverware and appetizer plates took a while to appear, and only after we requested them, for example.    The deck offers a great view of the Rocky River, which is sure to be picturesque during all four seasons.  No alcohol of any sort (not even beer) on Sunday.  The wine list is heavily themed - \"Firehouse, Red Truck, Firelands, etc.\"  There's also a lengthy \"martini\" list that included a few tempting options... we'll have to return on a \"licensed\" day of the week."}
{"text":"My hub & I always enjoy Moosehead Hoof & Ladder, but it is my mom's absolute favorite. Mom is in her late 80's & in a wheel chair full time. The MH staff never fail to bend over backwards to get us an accessible table on their lovely deck, \"tweak\" menu offerings to meet mom's food requests, etc. We ate there today & in addition to the usual tasty food, had great service from Brianne. We've had to eliminate some restaurants from our list of faves because of difficulties w/ the wheel chair, but NOT the Moosehead. Have also dined there with very young kids in the mix, and have been well accommodated."}
{"text":"Tonight was a beautiful Saturday evening and we wanted to take advantage of what could be the last 'patio dining' day of this season. We arrived around 5:30 and were promptly seated on the back patio.  We then waited for someone to say 'hi' or at least take our drink order. 10 minutes went by and I finally went to the desk and asked if we had a server. Jason finally showed up and took our order. (I recognized him! He waited on two tables next to us during the 10 minutes we were waiting!) The food came out quickly enough. My wife's soup was good, the kids meals were - well - kids meals and while my patty melt looked amazing, it had absolutely no flavor. (I don't even think they put salt and pepper on the patty.) On a side note, the homemade chips were sinfully incredible! As we finished up, Jason got us drink refills and we asked for a take home box and the check. He promptly brought everything. We boxed it all up and put the card out to pay. We waited... waited... waited... finally I got so frustrated I put the card back in my wallet, took out all the cash I had and left it for the bill. So Jason, if you're wondering why you got a 10% tip... read above."}
{"text":"I must say I was nervous to eat here after reading some of the reviews. We were all pleased with our experience.  This is a sandwich and appetizer kind of restaurant.  Our food was good, the service was friendly and efficient, the firehouse decor is nice for a change of pace, and the prices were reasonable.  Our only complaint was that it was cold and some of us ate with our coats on.  We will go back in the summer to eat in the outside area."}
{"text":"We love the Moosehead both in Olmsted Falls and Westlake.   The food is reliably great and the outside dining is teriffic."}
{"text":"Pros: * Nice patio with a view of a lush burbling creek  * Hearty bar food that will certainly soak up a good pint of frothy beer * Cute brick building that seems to have character and interesting history   * Pleasant service  Cons:  * Menu not especially friendly to the health conscious or vegetarians * Food is starchy, large portions and tends toward over salted * My pierogi sandwich tasted like dry bread on bread with extra potato * Not the cheapest given the quality of the food * Service can be quite slow, especially if you're on the patio it can sometimes feel like  a server forgot about you  Overall: three stars. Not worth a special trip, don't expect your socks blown off, but if you want to fill your belly with food that would make Dr. Oz cry while enjoying a view of some peaceful greenery, this place will deliver."}
{"text":"I love the charm of this renovated fire house.  The lighting, the decor - this is the reason I would come back if my friends invited me.    The service was another story.  I went with family on a Friday afternoon after  Christmas shopping and the staff was completely MIA.  I get that it was 3:30 on a week day, but there was no one around to seat us.  No one at the bar.  There were a few other patrons there so we knew that the place was open, but their tables weren't getting service.    When we did formally get greeted an offered a table, the server decided this was a great opportunity to tell us her whole life story.  Including her relationship with her 'old man', money troubles, car troubles, her daughter from her last relationship, where she should go to find a sugar daddy, etc.  WAY to much information!  All of this before she offered to get us a drink.    The food was really average, with the exception of the Shrimp Kabob appetizer.  It is wrapped in bacon and has bbq sauce.  Anything with bacon is instantly more delicious, and this is a recipe I will steal for parties.  :)  Otherwise, the rest of our lunch was just basic bar food.  Nothing special.  We ordered chocolate martinis and chocolate mousse martinis.  There was no bar tender there, so the waitress decided to make them herself.  They were not very good and both of the small martini glasses were half empty when they arrived at our table.  I would not get a mixed drink from this place again.    After deciding we didn't like the drinks we both ordered coffee.  No refills and no follow up.  At the end of lunch we didn't even get our check.  We had to wait for at least 15 minutes before we saw our server again and then ask for it, even though all of the plates had been cleared and our cups were bone dry.    The service really wasn't good, but I don't want to hold one shoddy server against this place.  The charm and ambiance alone will tempt me to give it another chance *if* friends suggest it.  But I won't bring it up.  I really hope they get some more professional - or at least non-drama - servers.  That would have made all the difference."}
{"text":"I love the scenery here,  just beautiful. I also love the old firehouse. So cool and unique! I've been here before, and had good experiences. Last night, was my 1st negative. Service was good,  appetizer was delicious, drinks good.  I ordered tv's Philly cheese steak sandwich and whenI got it,  about 1/3 was gristle. Totally turned me off. The sandwich seemed a little pricy to begin with @ $13,99, but I gave it a shot. Very disappointing. I couldn't even eat 1/4 of it because the thought of chewing on fat makes me I'll.  I'll go back, but I'll  stay away from meat."}
{"text":"I took my dad here for lunch on a Saturday and we had good food and a great waiter. I got the Chicken Salad on a croissant which was delicious and I like that they serve french onion dip with the side of chips. No extra extra charge for the dip like most places. My dad got the reuben and said it \"hit the spot\". Our waiter stopped by to tell us our order was in and when it was coming out which I thought was a nice touch. We decided our waiter reminded us of Chris Hemsworth- man bun, deep voice, same build, just no accent (ha ha)."}
{"text":"Food good, service a bit slow. Could be due to the holiday week, but I expected better. Place was packed for lunch on a Monday.   Had the Philly cheese steak and Philly chicken. Both sandwiches were good, but the homemade chips with French onion dip stole the show.   Good beer selection. Will need to come back when I don't have to go back to work!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Irish Burger...it was cooked the way I ordered it. The hamburger itself was really good. And I really enjoyed the homemade chips.  The atmosphere is awesome. And our service was good too."}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the last few years.  Great spot to eat out on the back patio (in good weather!).  I've had their burgers (good) and a few salads like the buffalo fried chicken salad.  Unfortunately, my last time here the waitress totally misunderstood me and brought out a buffalo chicken sandwich.  I never like to waste food so I ate it, and it was just fine.  She wanted to bring me out a salad, but I would not let her.  The sandwich came with their own house-made chips which were seasoned, crispy and tasty.  I'm sure I'll give them another try sometime."}
{"text":"Love the old mystique of this rehabbed fire station, they kept alot of the original pieces which really gives it a nice appeal. They have just changed their menu and paired it down some, I have always thought they had \"too much variety\" on their menu. Great news is they kept alot of the favorites, the buffalo chicken egg rolls, the moosini sandwich and their reuben! All an all great food for a decent price. This is a hot spot for us when it is warm as their outside seating overlooks the valley."}
{"text":"So good!  I've actually never heard of this place, but went with my husband and my parents since we had a gift card.  My mom and I split the reuben on potato pancake sandwich and the french onion steak sandwich. Both were delicious but the reuben on potato pancake sandwich was amazing!  I would have a hard time not getting that again when we come back, which I would like to go in the summer months to check out the patio.  The service we had was very good as well.  Only con I can think of is their draft beer selection wasnt very impressive."}
{"text":"This place was really good when they opened, but it seems like every year the food gets more expensive, the number of items goes down and the amount you get decreases too. I'm not one to say you need gluttonous portions, but when a Reuben is $13 it should be bigger than a half sandwich. They also didn't inform me one year on valentines day, which happened to be on a Sunday, that they have no Sunday alcohol sales. A little disappointing for my wife and I who booked a reservation and expected a bottle of wine. This is one of those places that only exists because it's one of the better places where it is located. If it were next door to say dons lighthouse, similar prices, it would be out of business in months at best."}
{"text":"Ok it's Friday nite about 7:00 PM so we had to wait 15 minutes or so if you know anything about Olmsted Falls there aren't many places to eat and none can compare to this Fire House Environment? I want to start by saying the staff was very organized and friendly our server was great there when needed  but allowed us to have a conversation but we never waited for anything great job. Now for the food I had the roast beef cheddar sandwich nice toasted roll lots of lean tender roast beef with excellent cheddar melted on top with a side of au jus it was awesome, this was served with homemade chips and a pickle - my daughter had a steak Caesar Salad with extra dressing the steak was ordered medium it was medium plus but lean and tender she enjoyed it and it was a very nice dinner size. the place is a little louder than you would want but it was a packed house on a Friday night so get over it. One negative we both started our dinner with clam chowder it was loaded with clams and very nice texture but cold we didn't complain we really didn't want it microwaved so we enjoyed it for what it was I only imagine how good it would have been hot out of the pot. Yes four stars it's outstanding!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful location with a fun history. The firehouse theme stems from the restaurant being a former fire station. This place is intimate and cozy but also a great place for family and friends. If it's a beautiful summer day and cosy is not what you are looking for check out their back patio that has a beautiful surrounding of the local park.  They offer a wide variety of homestyle entrees and other delicious offerings. My most recent visit I had their potato, bacon and cheddar soup which was like a warm hug. Their sandwiches come with delicious homemade potato chips and even tastier homemade french onion dip.   This is a great place no matter what you are in the mood for!"}
{"text":"Only stopped in for drinks at the bar.  What a cute place!  And the back patio is awesome.  I don't know anything about the food but I hope to go back and give it a try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is bigger than it looks. We were here before and just sat on the front patio. The back patio is beautiful! Overlooking the metro park and a bubbly stream. A nice place to sit and enjoy all the leaves changing colors. Our waitress,Amanda, was very pleasant and helpful with her recommendations. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and a side salad. The salad was nothing special. I tried the raspberry vinaigrette and it was tasty. My husband ordered the cheese steak sandwich and French fries. He enjoyed his lunch. We will come back here again! Nice place to sit for an afternoon."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was pulling into the wrong driveway, I realized right away that I couldn't park there but a woman in a large SUV shook her head no at me. I asked \"are they not open?\" Her response was \"we're open but you can't park here\" There's a nice way to direct your customers. We waited for an outside table, hostess was friendly but completely ignored another guest that wanted to be seated. Our server seemed irritated with us. We have to eat gluten free because of allergies. When asked if they have a dedicated fryer, she said they couldn't because then they'd have to have one for everyone with an allergy. A simple \"no I'm sorry\" would've been fine. I gave a star for good food and another for the drinks. Our server did not offer desert or coffee or clear our dirty plates before dropping the check. I asked for a box, in my California accent and she handed it to me she said \"said here's your box\", exaggerating the word box. I pretended not to notice because I was taught good manners but really? You're making fun of my accent? This place would be great if they cared about customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped here in a whim after walking around downtown Olmsted Falls. The food is good, my steak sandwich came with potato chips made fresh in house. Attention is paid to detail here, that's for sure. The wait staff treated us well, and the interior of the restaurant seems nice, although we were seated in the overflow room where not much was happening. I'll go back there again for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. The meat is very tender, and very fresh. Ask for Brittany as a waitress!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here about 8 or 10 times and have never had a bad experience. The food is great and the service is friendly, attentive, and prompt. Whether you get a sandwich, a salad, or the French onion soup (my fav) you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio on a nice day and almost anything on this menu make for a nice lunch date. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my wife had a taco salad. We both enjoyed our meals.  The service was very good to go with a good table and good food. Moosehead had a decent lunch crowd this visit as it was on my last visit. We enjoyed our lunch and will be back again soon. Maybe next time we'll grab dinner and a beer."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit high for what they offer. I had the beer battered walleye hoagie and fries. I thought the sandwich was good. The girlfriend had the cod bowl. She complained to me that it tasted weird. We both agreed the fries sucked. She then came home and promptly threw up."}
{"text":"Ate here on a warm Monday for dinner on their beautiful outdoor back patio with family. We ordered  the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer, house burger, turkey Reuben and kale salad with beets as entrees . The food was prepared as requested and  tasted very good but my burger was the best, thick and juicy with cheese,sautéed onions and mushrooms all on a toasted bun... delicious! Great service,small but beautiful patio and a bit pricey, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"2nd time we've eaten at the Moosehead Hoof & Ladder in Olmsted Falls, it's absolutely wonderful! The Buffalo egg rolls are to die for. I had the pecan crusted salad with chicken, HUGE and VERY good. My husband had the turkey melt and would order again. Their homemade chips are delicious.  Westlake location is just as good!!! Already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Nice place in a really charming area.  This location is a \"lot\" bigger than the Bay Village location.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with house made chips and dip, and it was all delicious.    Plenty of room for large parties, unlike the Bay location, however the Bay patio is nicer.    Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was totally expecting frozen mixed vegetables. What a refreshing surprise to get fresh mixed veggies as a substitute for fries with my perch dinner. Everything was good and completely fulfilling. Gluttony still got the better of me so I ordered the chocolate moose cake to go before returning to my hotel"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday just looking for somewhere I've never been in my area.  The patio was beautiful.  Definitely one of the best on the west side of town.  I didn't see a cat or have any problems with bugs as I read in an earlier review.    The food wasn't anything out of this world but it was good.  I had one of the summer salads which was very refreshing and light.  My friend had a steak kabob which he said was good.    The service was good.  They were pretty busy for a Wednesday evening.  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food and service with a small town feel then Moose Head is your place. I've been here several times in the past but today I went for the first time in quite a while. I enjoyed lunch with a couple of friends and my two young kids. Our server, Allie, was absolutely wonderful! She is the type of person who anticipates your needs before you realize you need anything. The food is always enjoyable. My kids enjoyed their meals very much as did I. I promise I won't let this much time pass before I'm back for another great meal."}
{"text":"Slower than expected service on a late Saturday afternoon. Cocktails were delicious and sandwiches weren't too bad! Great view if you grab a back patio seat."}
{"text":"I like but do not love this restaurant. I go here a decent amount with coworkers because it's got a huge menu and everyone can find something. They have good specials, nice staff and a lot of variety! It's sort of \"bar food\" but I would say it's a step up from what you'd expect.   Decor is very eclectic. There is interesting stuff all over the walls and even ceiling! It's super interesting. They also have a patio with an excellent view.   In terms of the food, I'm a vegetarian and I like that there are numerous options for me. Lots of sandwiches, salads and a veggie burger. I have always liked what I have eaten but never been blown away. The house made chips with dip that come with sandiwches are probably my favorite thing there - they're delicious! What I don't love is the lack of healthier options.. The salads are all pretty unhealthy (they add fries or breaded things which are delicious but make it sooo much worse for you). The salads are also pricy so I usually end up getting a wrap or veggie burger instead.  I know people who like it more than I do so you might love it but generally, I just say it's good but not mind blowing. I think it's a tad pricey for what you get but the portion sizes are large so it's not wayyy overpriced or anything."}
{"text":"I work a spit away from here, but live far off so I was excited to get to try the Moosehead.  Built in an old Firehouse, the Moosehead Hoof & Ladder has great atmosphere, great good, and great service.   I read it can be busy on Friday nights, but we must have had good timing. We only waited 10 minutes for a table. We didn't mind the wait, it gave us a chance to look around at the firehouse memorabilia such as the hose tower and old photographs. There is lots of table seating and space around the bar, but I could see how it could get crowded and loud quickly. It seems to be a very popular destination. The server and hostess were friendly and attentive.    My husband ordered the gyro and I went on a limb (as I am not usually a fan of tomatoes and mushrooms) and ordered the Mozzarella Monster. Love that my sandwich came with chips and dip! The Mozzarella Monster was fried mozzarella, tomatoes, veggies, and pesto. Messy and good but it hit the spot. It was big sandwich but not obnoxious.  The menu has a lot to offer including quite a few vegetarian options. Many dishes could be substituted with veggies or portobello instead of chicken or beef. Nice. The salads on the back of the menu looked tantalizing but I didn't notice the back of the menu until after we ordered.  Note to self: Must try to the taco salad!  My co-workers say the patio is lovely. It overlooks the Falls.  It had just rained when we got there and the patio was too slick for dining.   Parking is sort of chore. There's not a lot of space. Overall we enjoyed our experience and are looking forward to going back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Originally wrote a review in 2012 and my wife and I still are coming here probably as early as 2010. We absolutely love moosehead. The setting is perfect. The old firehouse is amazing. Service is great. Management is receptive to customer needs. Drinks are updated. Could use more local beer and/or drafts though.   Buffalo Eggrolls are still the best in town! Always love the Moosehead - check out the one in Westlake too!"}
{"text":"My companion and I had a steak salad and burger, both were decent. The cocktails, however, were atrociously sweet. Avoid any with blackberry syrup."}
{"text":"Prices have gone way up and menu has gotten smaller over the past few years. There used to be a wait for a table but now you can go any time and get seated right away. There are definitely better options for eating in this great little community."}
{"text":"Love this location! Sitting on the back deck is lovely. The salads were good, large portions and the fish cooked perfectly. We will soon return. The only drawback is the prices are a little inflated."}
{"text":"Moosehead, I so want to like you but you fail me every time.  Pros: Decent menu Fun space / ambiance Great patio  Cons: Crappy hostesses. Crappy service. Crappy Manager.  My mother & I arrived one Saturday evening to a brief wait.  The \"typical\" cute, but not bright, hostesses had no clue how to interact with humans or communicate appropriately.  I chalk this up to them being young and the fact that parent's don't educate their children how to speak to adults with ease and confidence.    We were seated and I was a bit surprised to see a very full bar and at least 4 empty tables.  Clearly the restaurant wasn't staffed appropriately for Saturday night dinner service.  Thus began more waiting.  The table behind us got up in search of the manager, and upon her arrival to the table, she only provided excuse after excuse to whatever their complaints / concerns were.  She clearly didn't care about the quality of service her staff or she was providing.  I was just about to flag her down after waiting 8+ minutes to be greeted when our server finally appeared.    I can't complain about my server, after all, we expressed our displeasure at waiting so long to be greeted, she apologized and corrected the error for the rest of the meal.  This may or may not have been due to the fact that she recognized me from previous employment location.  Regardless, the rest of our meal was fine and appropriately and timely served.  I cannot say the same for the table behind us who appeared to have nothing but troubles and more visits by the inept manager.  Sadly, there aren't tons of good food options in the Olmsted Falls greater area.  Even more sad is the fact that 9 out of 10 times I have problems with service at Moosehead.  It truly is a shame they can't get their act together.  When given the option to go there, I'll opt for not."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times before and the food/view/service was good, so being buffet aficionados we jumped in the car in anticipation of their advertised $13.95 buffet offered from Oct 27 thru Nov 24th.    When we ordered the buffet, the waitress offhandedly told us they decided not to have it anymore because it wasn't drawing in enough people. This in a packed house on buffet day.  We would have left right then at this outright bait n switch, but we were already there so we grudgingly ordered off the menu.  The (I assume) manager offered us $5 off our meals, it was meaningless at that point--we still felt duped. Five bucks wouldn't pay for the gas it took to get out there.   The waitress claims the buffet might be back in Feb, but we definitely won't be back at all to let them fool us twice...shame on you Moosehead.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cool place for lunch.  Even better in the warmer months when the patio is open."}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch and wanted someplace with outdoor seating.  The patio was nice with beautiful view. I read the other reviews and the complaints about long wait time for food was valid. We weren't in a hurry and we were enjoying the outdoors until it rained (but that wasn't their fault).  The waiter did acknowledge we were waiting a long time for food but kept making excuses like he just got slammed with 4 tables all at once. He did try to keep our water glasses full but no attempt to smooth things over and did not offer any assistance when it started to rain. One table was served their food during rain and their food got rained on (they were not happy and asked for their check immediately).  Otherwise my Mooseberry salad was very good with grilled portobello mushrooms. My hubby got a burger and he said it was good, also. We will give it another try but make sure you are not in a hurry to leave."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a burger junkie and I can tell you that the Moosehead has the best burgers around. Their meat is always cooked to Perfection with very satisfying portions and very good chip dip. The good beer selection enhances their reputation. Monday night is $2 off all burgers so if you're a first-timer you might want to check it out on a Monday. Cool atmosphere, nice waitstaff, outdoor seating.   Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food was delicious and the waitress was really friendly. Definitely going there again"}
{"text":"We were there last week, have passed it many times saying \"we have to check that out\", so we did...mixed review, tables were sticky, moved outside on back patio, it is very nice, and that deck surface...excellent! even when wet..safe, .smart idea. I had the Moosehead burger with fries, fries were \"soggy\", I left 1/2 of them on the plate, my wife had the shrimp mooseberry salad, she is STILL raving about it!. I was pleased to see the 25% discount for service members/veterans, I am a veteran, and had my service cap on, the server did not ask, and the bill did not reflect it, had to ask for it, the service was a \"C\" at best, I don't know if we will go back. Very nice decor, the carpet was pretty dirty though.."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably priced, nice portions BUT just OK flavor.    The old firehouse converted into a restaurant is pretty cool The decor is displays of fire hoses and fire bells.   The service was below acceptable. One sever for 2 individual parties of 8+ people in each group. From the time we ordered our meals it was one hour before we received them.  Parking is very limited so if you are meeting several people for dinner you should plan to car pool   Will most likely not return because of the extremely slow service."}
{"text":"We've visited the other location many times & loved the atmosphere & food.  This site has a great atmosphere as well & we love the firehouse theme.  The food was very good as always, but service wasn't up to par.  We wanted fries instead of chips with my sandwich plus a half order of onion rings.  We only got the onion rings & she brought chips with my sandwich.  I mentioned that I had asked for fries, & she said she'd check, then said they were putting down a fresh batch & she asked if I wanted mayo for my sandwich & I did.  10 minutes or more I finally got the mayo, I never got the fries & while they weren't on the check, she never acknowledged that they were never brought out.  They did bring a fresh batch to take to go, but it shouldn't have come down to that.  We will try again, but it did spoil our first visit here somewhat."}
{"text":"Great building, great location but the food and service are at or below average, consistently. The food is o.k. slightly amped up bar food, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either. Have tried it about five times and just really want it to be good but they keep coming up short. Here are two examples why; twice have stopped in for drinks and apps about an hour before closing during the week. Twice staff had started vacuuming and cleaning while we were eating. Some clean up is acceptable as closing approaches but one the girl actually vacuuming under our feet! We asked her could she please stop as we were having a conversation and trying to enjoy our drinks and food and she completely ignored us. Maybe the vacuum was too loud? We actually got up and left a full half hour before closing.  Second incident. I stopped with my wife for a drink around dinner time. I ordered my favorite Scotch, neat. The bottle was correct however it was not the proper Scotch in the bottle. I told the young bartender who then got the manager. He argued with me, told me I was nuts and said he would open a brand new bottle in front of me to compare them. We did and he immediately admitted it was not the same liquor. I explained what I ordered was a single malt and what was in the bottle was an inferior blended whiskey. I do not think the restaraunt did this but they may have had a bartender messing around or topping off bottles or something. Bottom line, even though he admitted he was wrong no apology no free drink no thank you for pointing it out, he just took bad bottle and walked away!"}
{"text":"Great bloody Mary selection and river views"}
{"text":"I always rate eateries with one question in mind: how well does the restaurant do what it's trying to do?   The Hoof & Ladder wants to be a cozy restaurant that serves delicious bar food. It definately delivers!  The interior decor has a firefighting theme surrounded by beautiful warm woodwork and copper tin cielings, and plenty of booths. The restaurant is broken up into several areas which gives it an intimate feel. The atmosphere is wonderful -- I just want to lie down and take a nap after I eat!   The menu is upscale bar food consisting of burgers, quesedillas, salads, etc. We've tried many different items and have never been disappointed yet. The beer selection is good with several beers on tap to try.   Not only is the interior cozy, the outdoor patio looks over the Rocky River winding through the Metroparks. What a fantastic view!   If you're looking for a uniquely themed restaurant with upscale tavern food, a good choice of libations, and a cozy atmosphere, the Hook & Ladder is the place!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Nothing great.   The service was terrible. I waited a long time before being greeted. Tori finally came over to me. I felt neglected the whole time. She never cleared my dirty dishes and I had to eat my dessert with my dirty empty lunch dish still sitting on the table. After the dessert course she never came back around and I had to stand up and find a server to cash me out. Disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"OK, first off, Olmsted Falls is one of the most amazing little places in the world, and NO ONE seems to know about it outside of Cleveland.  This restaurant is right in the middle of the town, and it is so full of character and ambiance that even if you just went to the bar and ordered a Bud Light, you'd have a great time.  The building was apparently once a firehouse, and so they have decorated it accordingly.  Their menu is full of decent bar-food type items.  I had a burger with pulled pork on top which was pretty good!  I definitely recommend eating here if you ever find yourself in Olmsted Falls!"}
{"text":"I really like this place!  If not just for the homemade potato chips...great food, service, atmosphere, everything.  Great place for the family to eat in an off the beaten path locale."}
{"text":"I was a bit underwhelmed with my experience at the Olmsted Falls Moosehead Saloon. I just don't get what everyone else is raving about. \"Some of the best food in Cleveland\", really? Eat out much? Yeah, they have a patio that overlooks the woods. I'm not a patio guy. I prefer to eat indoors without insects buzzing around my plate and the wind blowing my napkin off the table every five minutes. And what's with the cat roaming around the patio while I'm trying to eat? Isn't there some sort of health code violation happening there? Alright, enough of that. Just so you don't think I'm a total curmudgeon, I did like the building. The whole converted firehouse thing is pretty cool. I'm not sure what was with the little plaid skirts and black leggings worn by the teenage server girls, but as far as uniforms go, not a terrible choice.  Now for the food. The Moosehead menu is quite expansive for a place of their ilk. The apps are basically your standard fried bar fare (o-rings, calamari, cheese sticks, wings), you've got about a dozen variations of salad, sandwiches, some larger entrees and a handful of vegan/gluten-free options. There are so many options my first thought was they couldn't possibly do any of them very well. Since we only ordered a few of them I really don't have the evidence to support this claim, though.  The story of our meal begins unassumingly enough with the munch skins, the Moosehead version of the classic potato skin app. I really don't have much to complain about here. Idaho potatoes, sliced in half, bacon and cheddar cheese, sour cream on the side. We got the small order which consisted of three halves. They were pretty tasty. The potatoes were fork tender and the melted cheese covered a rather sizable amount of diced bacon.   Next in the culinary progression came a cup of French onion soup. This was also rather tasty. Not overly salty like most versions I've had, the sweet onions were soft and there was plenty of cheese draped over the cup. My only gripe on this dish was the bread component. It had all but disintegrated into the soup leaving very little texture. Overall, not a bad rendition.  It was to be a salad night for the both of us. My wife opted for the salmon club (or so she thought) and I the house specialty \"Autumn\" salad (apparently held over due to popular demand). Now, if you're out of mixed greens you need to tell your patrons that you're out of mixed greens. Most of the salads listed on the menu, including the two we had, listed mixed greens as the base. We both received chopped Romaine.   The Autumn salad consisted of sliced granny smith apples, cranberries, blue cheese crumbles, toasted walnuts and a chicken breast breaded in sweet potatoes, fried and sliced all atop a bed of Romaine lettuce. The dressing I chose was the cranberry vinaigrette. Again, not bad. Everything appeared nice and fresh and the dressing was a good balance of sweet and tart, but it was awkward to eat given the large pieces and the chicken was dry and chewy.  My wife's salmon was grilled (although strangely devoid of grill marks and caramelization) and she had no complaints about the fish itself, where there was issue was with the salad she ordered and what she received. Expecting a Caesar salad as the menu states she instead received some sort of unlisted, hybrid salad with slices of unripened, tasteless tomato, anemic rings of grilled red onion, bacon bits olives and some wedges of roasted redskin potato. There were also two pieces of toasted white bread on the side. I've never seen a salad served with roasted potatoes and I'm not sure where the toast comes in, but the whole thing just fell short. It was sort of the BLT salad and sort of the salmon club. Either way, just so-so.  Yeah, they've got a nice patio. Sure, they're located in picturesque white bread Olmsted Falls. But I just wasn't enamored by the experience. Our server was pleasant and attentive enough (my iced tea was never empty), but it did take about 10 minutes before anyone even came over to our table after we were seated. Overall, a mediocre, forgettable dining experience that I doubt we will be repeating anytime soon."}
{"text":"This unique restaurant is located in a great small town, with the sounds of the falls in the rear has outdoor seating a primary place to eat. The food is excellent and moderately priced. The ribs were delicious and you must try their award winning Chili. A great place for an evening out for two or the family."}
{"text":"Cool little bar and restaurant with fun decor.   I usually get their upscale burgers and a good beer. Nothing too fancy but everything you would want. You get a decent amount of food and it is usually done up right. The staff is knowledgeable and the service good.   They aren't going to blow you away like some of these other reviews, but you will leave happy and full! The location also is cool so make sure to walk around the area too. The covered bridge and old style shops the across the street are kinda cool. Give em a try!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time even giving this place one star  Service was terrible slow and rude to boot  Food was sub par worse Rueben I've had in a long time beer was Luke cold barely  The only thing this place has going for it is the patio on the back other than that stear clear"}
{"text":"One of my favorite summer outings is dinner on this patio followed by a hike by the falls. The views of the river from the patio are lovely and the food is tasty, too. Winter takes us inside but the decor of this fire station turned restaurant is charming and welcoming. I've never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"Moosehead Hoof & Ladder is a fun place to go and grab lunch! The restaurant itself is in an old firehouse and is still decorated as such, which makes for a very lovely atmosphere. The servers were quite attentive, the food arrived in a timely fashion, and the prices were affordable. I distinctly remember ordering the Melwood Burger (that has BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese, among other things) which was juicy and full of flavor. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in w a big group, as always, on a late Saturday lunch. Luckily, we were seated pretty quickly.  Service was good, really nice. Server suggested the roast beef & cheddar sandwich. It was quite nice, on a tasty, toasted bun, quality steak, and cooked correctly. The au jus dipping sauce was quite good. Happy."}
{"text":"One of our familiar haunts located in the nook of Olmsted Falls where 252 makes an abrupt change in direction. Very nice interior if you like wood finish (I do) and a fire department theme. This is the younger sister location to the original in Westlake just south of the Bay Village line on Dover. This place is much more spacious. Parking can be tricky because in good weather the area gets crowded.   Staff has always been friendly and attentive. The food is solid pub food: burgers, wraps, salads and sandwiches. Nothing too fancy though note that the pricing is not inexpensive. Draft beer list is okay but not great. The gnome loves their cosmos, tasty and strong.   We've never had dessert so cannot comment.   Nice place with good food and friendly staff. A good representation of what s public house should be."}
{"text":"Friend and I had dinner... And kicked it off with an app- Artichoke dip which was kinda bland actually...No worries because the company rocked as did the view! I always order burgers and this time no exception... Nice and juicy!! fries were almost overcooked but still quite good and a big ole pickle spear was delish!  All in all a very nice evening!!!!!"}
{"text":"First let me say the that Bloody Marys (Maries?) were very delicious. Their home made chips and french onion dip is definitely a must, but as far as most other things, it's better than mediocre but nothing to fawn over. The space/atmosphere is very nice and it's pretty cool that it used to be an old firehouse."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch mid-week with my family.  Place was not that busy from what I could tell, but people were being seated throughout our visit.  Decor is nice, as others have noted.  The restaurant is somewhat sprawling, so I didn't get to see the entire place.  Service was friendly, as well.  Calamari appetizer was tasty, but sparse.  Piled on top of the signature potato chips, so it looked like more than it really was.  Kids meals were done well.  The Buffalo (chicken sandwich) was interesting, as it included fries (Panini-style) and cabbage instead of lettuce.  Could've done without the fries on the sandwich, to be honest, but that could be personal preference.  Total bill came to $56 for one appetizer, two kids meals, two adult meals and four soft drinks (three were kid-size), so it wasn't exactly a cheap lunch.  All in all, not bad, and we might try it again for dinner at some point."}
{"text":"My two stars are for service and ambiance. I ordered the crab cakes and they were mostly filler. For 14.99 they should be mostly crab. Not impressed with menu either. Junky bar food."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and I could never find something on their huge menu that stood out as unique.  However, the food has always been very good.    I think I finally found something unique in the bbq portobello mushroom wrap. It's got nice big pieces of the mushroom along with spinach, onion, tomatoes and other veggies along with the best part- fried mozzarella. The fried mozzarella adds a crispy texture to what would otherwise be a mushy wrap. My only complaint is too much bbq sauce in the wrap.  They have a few menu items that include portobello shrooms so I bet they'd all be good after having this wrap.  Great building and atmosphere with an awesome patio for the summertime btw.  Dry on Sundays."}
{"text":"First time here. It was for lunch. The place is pretty cool. It was an old firehouse it seems. Very clean and nice environment. The service was pretty good. Only complaint was that we ordered the seafood potato skins and they literally had about 2 ...not sure what to call them besides microshrimp, in each skin and a LOT of delicious cheese. The waitress stopped by to ask if they were good and said \" really good, huh?\" and before I could look up to say that maybe the seafood was left out accidentally she was already walking away. Please stop and ask how the food is and wait for a response. Other than that the rest of the food was very good if you are not concerned with health. I'm glad I got the salad bc everything else was a definite artery clogger. I just would not recommend the seafood skins for $14."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere of this place it's built into an old fire station, but this place did far from impressing me considering the reviews it has gotten. The waitstaff was very knowledgeable and helpful, and The food arrived within a really good time. But whoever is choosing their cuts of meat needs to redo their job.   I had the open faced prime rib with au jus. It was cooked right even though it was brought out semi-warm. Add the seasoning was lackluster at best. Even though it's prime rib, I would expect a decent amount of marbling within the meat, and I can tell you this was not it. I am used to prime rib with a decent amount of fat in it but the fat to usable meat ratio was all funky.   Will update more and better when I return to this restaurant as one dish does not make the grade."}
{"text":"Come here ALL the time, much better now that you aren't crowded like in Westlake...This one is much bigger! The potato skins are awesome, never a let down. The moosinis are great too, can't go wrong with any of those. Service is usually pretty good too. Sometimes it gets crowded so I'd call ahead. Beers are a little pricey but hey, it's pretty good food."}
{"text":"We had never been here, but heard a lot about it for years. Once we did go, we were sorry we had been missing this treat for so long. I really don't know where to start. Every appetizer, salad, entree and sandwich we've had has been excellent. The service has always been top notch, and the atmosphere is very inviting. It's a great casual American restaurant to put on your go-to list."}
{"text":"The food at the Moosehead is still excellent, and they have added one of the most picturesque deck dining experiences in all of Cleveland--go here for a lovely outdoor dining experience. Afterward, you can take a walk down the street to the covered bridge, and even stroll down the paved paths to a view of the falls. Cleveland should make better use of its verges for pleasant dining, and Moosehead is a great example of that."}
{"text":"The Moosehead is one of my favorite lunch places. They have a great atmosphere inside. It's an old firehouse converted to a restaurant and they maintained some of the authentic firehouse features. There is plenty of seating and they have 2 bars. Although it is typically busy, I usually get seated pretty quickly and the servers are very friendly.   The menu is great. I strongly recommend the buffalo chicken egg rolls and the french onion steak sandwich (with french onion soup for dipping). The menu is pretty big and I always have a difficult time determining what to order!   The highlight of this place is definitely the patio and surrounding views. It overlooks the Cleveland Metroparks and you'd be hard pressed to find a better view in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  In a nice quaint area with great atmosphere.  The food is always amazing and the best patio in the area!!!"}
{"text":"We are so disappointed! We used to eat here many times and liked their Burgers. Yesterday we ordered a Patty melt (medium well!!!) and a Gyro. The Patty melt was medium rare, the Gyro meat wasn't shaved but thick sliced.  It was early (5pm) and the place wasn't crowded at all, Basically one waitress per table, only a few tables occupied. Our waitress showed up only once after the food was served, so we had to call some other waitress over to tell her that the Patty melt was medium rare. She took it back, came back with the plate, and the food was very obviously reheated in the microwave, needless to say my spouse declined to finish it. My Gyro was thick sliced, that is not how Gyro is supposed to be made, I ate a few bites with knife and fork out of the bread. I don't like the chips either, but when I substitute fries instead and am asked to pay $2.99, NO WAY! The table was extremely sticky, the waitress explained that using the wrong cleaning solution damaged the finish, that's why the tables are all like that, but the would bring paper to put under our plates, which she never did. In the end she took part of the charge off the bill, stating since we ate less than half, we should only pay half. I tipped her 20% of the full bill anyways, but we are not going back.  We are not complainers, but that was way below standard. Sorry!"}
{"text":"THE BEST place for ribs! Sauce is to die for. Cozy atmosphere. Never have to wait to be seated. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Multiple visits and each time I wonder why I pay the prices for avg. bar food.  Yes, pricey!  A bowl of soup is just under $7.00.  An upgrade to fries is $3.00 and the kicker, $2.50 for them to split your sandwich in the kitchen if you're sharing!  No thanks, my knife can do the job.  Wings overpriced & undercooked.  Prime rib sandwich is fatty, extremely peppery & tough to chew.  Decent service & nice atmosphere, just a bit overpriced for what you get.  Again, at least 4 visits and just walk away disappointed."}
{"text":"This bar seems to look different every time we come to Vegas.   This is a good place to sit and watch people.   Find it odd that all the seating areas have a TV.   Who wants to watch TV when you are with your friends in Vegas?  I had a cosmopolitan and it was a typical cosmo, nothing special,  it cost $17.  Ouch.  My husband had a grey goose martini and it wasn't cold, which makes a martini awful.    Server was very nice.   Too many other bars, nothing special here."}
{"text":"The clambakes on Saturday, Oct 24th were meh - many clams were sandy and/ or didn't open; the chicken they served was one of those frozen patties with artificial grill marks (awful): and the \"roasted red skins\" tasteless and mushy.  Mentioned this to the waitress who didn't respond ?!  Not going back !!!"}
{"text":"I have tried a wide variety of menu items at the Hoof & Ladder and it's always been bad. Burgers, quesadillas, philly cheese steak, pasta.. everything always tastes like it was straight out of a freezer or a can and into the microwave. I had nacho's and they were about the only thing that was a decent tastyness, but that's because everything on them comes out of a can anyway. I want to like it because it's a cool spot, I suggest going for drinks only"}
{"text":"Took the family here for the first time this past weekend for lunch.  Very cool location (right on a cliff overlooking the Rocky River) in a remodeled firestation.  We got a table right at the window so the view was terrific. In the summer I imagine the limited patio seating would be fantastic.  The menu is quite large with a ton of selection. Most of it is bar food-type selections but many are variations on standard fare. So much to choose from!  My wife and I shared a Gyro and it was very tasty. Came with a side of homemade potato chips. Oh, the potato chips! Probably the best thing there and they come standard with most sandwiches (you can choose other standard sides like fries, etc). The chips came with a homemade french onion dip. Man, they were excellent. We asked our server for a doggy bag and she was kind enough to provide it. Seriously, they should sell the chips and dip in stores (they were that good).  My younger son opted for a kids meal with 2 sliders and fries. He was the one who actually recommended the place (he went with his grandparents a few weeks back) so he of course loved his sliders. Decent size and plenty of food for him  My other son got a 7 oz cheeseburger and enjoyed it as well. Good flavor, nice fresh bun and cooked to order. Also came with chips and dip.   We ordered a potato pancake as a side and I wasn't as impressed with this as the rest of the meal. It was really big for a potato pancake but it was just okay. Didn't have much flavor and quite honestly looked like it was simply a large shredded hash brown patty.   Price was comparable to an Applebees or Red Robin. I think it was $40 for the 4 of us, including sodas and the extra potato pancake but remember my wife and I shared a gyro.   Overall, a very good experience. A few mentioned it in other reviews but parking is tough (small lot and not a lot of on street parking that is close). That said, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Waitress said she would have to charge me for extra pickles for my sandwich. Extra. For pickles. For a sandwich at a bar? Come on! This place used to be a favorite of mine. Lots of good food for a good price. Now they give you less, raised prices and even want to charge you for friggin pickles!! Never again."}
{"text":"Thought this place was pretty good! We went on a Friday night during Lent. They were really busy but moving pretty efficiently. I got the salmon dinner and my husband got the Lake Erie perch. We both liked our meals. Our server did forgot my husband's pierogie but brought it out after we mentioned it. The building and atmosphere are pretty cool. It is located in downtown Olmsted Falls which is such a cute area. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere.  I would like to try out the patio during the warmer weather months.  But for first visit it's a 3 star.  Food was good, but a little pricey for what you get.  Went there for lunch and had the patty melt, fries and iced tea.  The sandwich was alright-plain tasting, but nor bad.  Other people in the party who got burgers had similar opinions.  Those who ordered soup, salads and the walleye entrees seemed to like their lunch a little more than the people that got burgers.  The servers did keep up rather well with the party of 11!  Just wished the food was a little better.  I would probably go there again if I'm in the area, but wouldn't make a special trip to go there."}
{"text":"Great burgers and homemade potato chips.  This place has great ambiance and the help is very nice."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had great beer, potato skins were awesome and had the Pumper BLTS which was amazing! Tried my families meals which were great which included the chicken salad, the chicken Philly, and the clams and ribs. Can't wait to be in town again so I can eat here again. Oh and don't forget dessert..we had the moose cake and the deep fried Twinkies!"}
{"text":"Four stars? Really? Let me share our lunch today with you- a taco salad with unseasoned beef (chef must have been busy at 11:30 and had the busboy cooking) and no salsa in sight even after asking the waitress for some; a burger requested medium rare is well done with charring; the best item was an autumn (their word) salad with cranberry vinaigrette and dry sweet potato crusted chicken. Won't be back to find the four star meal. Loved the restaurant and patio overlooking the river. Thats what the two stars are for. Good spot to drink and pick at appetizers."}
{"text":"Great Manhattans and great food and atmosphere- very nice building in North Olmstead."}
{"text":"If you like huge portions of amazing food, this is the place for you! Try a salad! Homemade dressings! Everything here has been beyond amazing to me. Love this place. Casual atmosphere very homey great servers. Not a lot of wait time. Beautiful overlooks the river, so sit outside on the patio if it's warm enough!"}
{"text":"I have to say the reason I like this place the most is the décor. It's an old firehouse turned trendy restaurant and I love it. Between the hydrant fountain outside to the beautiful woodwork and light fixtures on the inside, this place is a \"off the grid\" foodies dream. The back patio is absolutely breathtaking over the Rocky River in the summer and fall.  Awesome menu. Really extensive in the burger/sandwich area and they even have a gluten free section! The burger with no bun comes with red skin potatoes instead of fries which I found refreshing. Something a little more on the healthy side. Good beer selection and some really unique appetizers. Everyone should try it at least once!"}
{"text":"I have to say: the atmosphere and ambience of eating here on the back patio is pretty much unmatched. The inside looked beautiful as well. Coolest thing ever to do with this amazing building - firehouse turned bar and grill. Not to mention that our waitress was one of the best I've had in a while.  My true review would have to be a 3.5 though. That's because of the food. Don't get me wrong, it was good and seemed reasonably priced for what you get. It just seemed to me like there was an identity crisis happening....the ambience and service were high-end. The food was typical grill fare....burgers, wings, and sammies. I just feel like mid-range New Anerican fare (a la Graffiti or Luxe) would make so much more sense. Once you've had a burger, id imagine you've had a burger, when I feel like this place has the potential and possibility to be so much more."}
{"text":"Growing up in Olmsted Falls, I have always complained that there is nothing to do there and nowhere cool or exciting to go. However, Olmsted Falls has made some very exciting changes in recent years, and the addition of Moosehead is definitely one of them. Old fire station turned restaurant, Moosehead is a must try if you're in the area. From the comfortable atmosphere to the friendly staff, there's a lot to like.       The waitress and I bonded over the uncommon spelling of our first names, which we realized we shared. She was super friendly and attentive. The place was not very crowded considering it was an awkward time, but there was a decent crowd and our waitress was good about making sure we had everything that we needed.       The menu has all of the basics from burgers to soups and salads to sandwiches and entrees. The prices are average with $10 burgers but are higher for things like a Philly cheesesteak ($13). I ordered the Melwood Burger, which is a BBQ burger with onion straws. I ordered it cooked medium, and it came out with just the right amount of pink. I enjoyed the sandwich, but either the burger or the sauce was a little too salty for my taste. Most things on the menu come with handmade chips (delicious) and dip, or you can upgrade to fries, onion rings, or other options for $2.       My mother ordered the pierogi sandwich (to die for), which was rye bread with pierogies and fried mozzarella and sauerkraut. My grandfather got a patty melt that I didn't try, but that he enjoyed. Finally, my grandmother ordered the black bean veggie burger. Again, I didn't try it, but she loved it and it was much bigger than the typical veggie burger that you see. My grandparents also got sides of the French onion soup, which they said they enjoyed.       Overall, the atmosphere and food is enough to make me want to come back. The people are friendly and I love to support anything in Olmsted Falls."}
{"text":"I am giving a 3 star rating due to the lack of service I received today for lunch. By the looks of other reviews, this seems to be very popular habit of this establishment. It was not busy at all. It was just my lady friend and I. We walked in and immediately loved the atmosphere and smells in the air. Checked in with host and seated right away. We sat there for a good 15-20 minutes until we had to reach out for service. Waitress was very apologetic. We understand as we are in service industry as well. We always try to understand the issues that can arise with the staff. Service was par. I think our girl was just having an off day. I must say that the food was well worth it though. We both had BBQ burgers and pinion rings. Completely satisfied with the food. I will definitely go back for a second run around."}
{"text":"Only gave 1 star because I had to give a star. The service here is awful.  We waited 10 minutes to see a server to just order drinks. The food was chain restaurants quality. We were first table sat in our section and everyone around us got food and drinks before us. The guy at table next to us went to the bar to get drinks for his family. I heard him say the burger was really bad. I gave up and ordered a side salad and potato skins as my meal. Server clarified that I wanted both as my meal and then brought the salad right after, even after clarifying that I wanted them together as my meal. So it sat there the entire wait. Just bad service and basic food."}
{"text":"Just was here last night, like the one in Westlake, food is great, atmosphere great, service great. Biggest complaint, in the bar area where our group sat, it was FREEZING in there. People sitting with their coats draped over their shoulders and others with their jackets still on. Turn the heat up a tad."}
{"text":"Picture an Applebees or Fridays with better food, more variety and different decor and you have Moosehead. This place is ALWAYS busy on a Friday or Saturday night so if you are expecting a quick meal then, forget it. The servers have always been great to us and the food is quick and very tasty. Some unique items on the menu keep us trying but we always go back to the Moosini's, which are panini's (with fries, coleslaw, etc) If you live in Olmsted Falls and don't want to drive to Great Northern or Southpark for dinner."}
{"text":"Well...I have not been here in a long while, and now I rememember why...  Arrival time... 8:06.  Hostess greets me to seat me...8:14 A server comes to my table for 1st time...8:26 My actual server came back to my table with my drink...8:29 My server came back...never...so we moved to bar where he was working so we might get service at 8:45 Our order was finally taken at 9:03 after I asked him if I could order Food came at 9:24...sub par  This place wasn't busy AT ALL!!!and we were literally the only people in there when I actually got to order my food... Only chili and a salad!) Bad service, sub par food, just an overall poor experience."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is great, the food is just okay. I can't ever tell if this is supposed to be a bar or more of a family establishment. It seems to swing in both directions, which I find odd at times. The menu is a step up from the regular bar menus, but is nothing to write home about. The food always is a bit too greasy for my liking and trying to find something really healthy is hard without losing pizazz."}
{"text":"Here for lunch?  A nice selection of slider options are available to enjoy. I have visited here often over the recent years and always enjoy the visit.  I love their ribs...wow, the sweet BBQ sauce is my style and lots of tender meat that I could eat all night.  Best part in the warm weather....eating out on the patio. It is a very different and lovely place to be overlooking the stoney creek. Watch out for the occasional train speeding throught Berea, it can be noisy while it passes."}
{"text":"a really cute and well-themed restaurant in the heart of historic olmsted falls. my fiancé and i have been living in the area for almost a year and we finally went and LOVED it. awesome food and great service. the homemade chips come with some dip that tastes like sour cream and onion dip. YUM"}
{"text":"Moosehead's (vast) menu felt like a bunch of \"dive joint\" food to me.  I found nothing particularly creative or inspired.  I've eaten here twice (and at their sister restaurant in Avon) and both times the food was OK, but nothing I would go out of the way for.    Redemption is found with the atmosphere. A cool fire station vibe, and waitresses running around in plaid skirts.    The bar/beer selection is also pretty good."}
{"text":"The service is SLOW with a Capital S and comes with a side of shade. We sat outside on the patio because it was unseasonably warm in Ohio - go figure. There were two inside bartenders who were responsible for two outside tables. Drinks were slow to come. Appetizer order felt like it took a long time. When I wanted another beer, I asked the server who was just leaving the other table. \"I'll get YOUR server\" she huffed at me. Wish I had a better experience cause it seems like a cute place. Too bad."}
{"text":"Food: Good standard American pub food. Their menu is huge and slightly overwhelming (I'm not a fan of big menus). The portions are enormous.  Cleanliness: This restaurant is spotless and beautiful. It's worth going just to see the amazing woodwork and remodeled space.  Service: Just meh. You know, girls in skirts.  Prices: A little high for what it is, but like I said, the restaurant is beautiful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quiet, classy, very homelike, almost feels like you're in a cabin eating (note that this review is for the Olmsted Falls location). The food has been great every time, I've never experienced any change in quality other than the fact that they changed dish styles. The potato skins are unbelievable! They aren't your average potato skin, it's a half potato loaded with bacon & cheese. I visit very often and I must say I'm highly addicted to Moosehead's Buffalo Chicken salad, it's so amazing that every time I cost I order that as my go to meal. I really enjoy this restaurant because it's calm and good food. Also if you're a craft Beer fan have no fear! Moosehead offers a nice sized Craft Beer menu."}
{"text":"I'd used Yelp and googled \"view\" and \"patio\".  Up came Moosehead.  It's too bad they don't open their patio earlier, because I ended up not being able to sit out there, but it is an AMAZING patio with a great view!!  Inside the decor is stylish, refurbished and very classy!  I loved the ironwork and the architectural details.    The food was good too!  I ordered the blackened tuna salad and the tuna was so good that I couldn't put dressing on until I was done with the fish.  Well flavored, well cooked, and just delicious!    So in short, it's a great restaurant and I'll have to come back to actually sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and enjoyed the food and good service.  I tried the lake perch dinner ($17) and it was very tasty.  Perch was lightly breaded and not too greasy. Dinner came with 1 pierogi, coleslaw and mixed vegetables.  (I subbed vegetables for the french fries).  The coleslaw was pretty bland, but the addition of some malt vinegar jazzed it right up. Next time I would probably substitute for the coleslaw as well.   My guest had the buffalo chicken egg rolls (Large eggrolls stuffed with chicken, cheddar & provolone cheeses, pepperoni and spinach. Your choice of either hot or mild sauce with crumbled bleu cheese. $11).  I did not try them, but my friend seemed to enjoy them.  Since I was a good girl and ate all of my vegetables, we decided to split a dessert.  Unfortunately, the pan cookie ala mode was way over baked and kind of burnt.  The server quickly offered to replace it, but found out the entire batch was ruined.  We got to eat the ice cream anyway and she took the dessert off of the bill."}
{"text":"Not impressed, the service was good but their prices seemed a little high for the area and the food that was brought."}
