{"text":"Our first time here and we will be back! We started with a small Caesar salad, which we split. It was enough for us both to have dinner size portions.I found the salad to be fresh and the Caesar dressing was tasty. We ordered a 12\" thin crust. It arrived quickly and piping hot. The ingredients were plentiful and fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The Pizza is amazing.  Love the cashew pesto chicken pizza!! Staff and owners are truly kind and accommodating!!"}
{"text":"Moving from NYC I was super excited to try this place, I really wanted to find and love pizza close to home ....
although the beautiful presentation, 
it's lacking flavor ...salt and garlic .... We waited a long time for JUST pizza.... When you go out for pizza ... You expect it to be quick .... 
The service was bad , I felt like I was being talked down to and ignored. 
Oh well."}
{"text":"We were pleased to hear that Brugos had opened a new place since we have always enjoyed their pizza and missed it when they closed in El Pedregal. Their new place is beautiful we think and have enjoyed returning. Chrissy is such a hard worker and always so happy to see you and acknowledges that fact. our only concern is that the service is Still slow which can totally affect your experience. Everyone is very friendly but just not terribly efficient?We want them to succeed so hope they will remedy this."}
{"text":"Love the pizza.  Make sure to order the Braveheart.  It's awesome, unique, and amazing.  My wife said its a guy pizza.  Highly recommended.  Beautiful spot.  You can tell the put everything into making it a success."}
{"text":"I ordered The Margarita pizza from the Gourmet pizza menu. The pizza did not have any tomatoes on it. It was also dry and overcooked with several large bubbles in the cheese. It reminded me of a cheap cheese pizza  you could get from a gas station / convenience store."}
{"text":"Fried calamari appetizer is delicious  followed by the chicken with roasted garlic pizza soooo good.  They also have a white Pino Noir that's quite nice and a nice beer selection.  Great atmosphere and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"The problem we had was with the owner. Which is the worst kind of a problem when the owner tries to justify charging 34.00 for 3 individual SMALL caesar salads. We asked for a caesar salad for 3 and was told they only have individual salads. When they charge $8.00 a piece then another $4.00 for 2 small pieces of anchovy  on each salad. So a salad for 3 adds up to $32.00! can you say \"cha-ching!\" And the owners answer to that is the parmesan is imported!! But she has a Caesar salad on the menu for $12.00 that will feed 3.... what.. that ones not imported? In all fairness our waiter was new, but when the owner found out... she did't want to correct the entire problem. She refunded $8.00 for one salad and said there was suppose to be more anchovies then we got for the $4.00 charge and that she would tell the kitchen so it won't happen to someone else?!? But what about the fact that it happened to us? We paid for what we didn't get. That type of ignorance is what prompted this yelp. The waiter was otherwise good and the food is just fine. The owner needs to understand business better or they won't make it in a small town. Having built a successful business from the bottom up, you can literally take that to the bank."}
{"text":"Good basic thin crust pizza. I ordered the \"wilted\" spinach salad which is actually not wilted at all. When I asked Steve our server about it he said he didn't know which I thought was a lame lazy answer. Other than that it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"Oh dear. Where to start - OK it's a nice interior, but the service is lacking severely, you're treated as an irritant rather than a valued customer when you ask questions. It's also VERY expensive -  $25 for a pizza that feeds 2, which would be acceptable, just, if the pizza was even vaguely special, but it isn't. It's a below average overloaded never-heard-of-Italy American-style mishmash of odd flavor combinations. Because it's so overloaded, the center dough isn't coked through, and it's pretty unpleasant. They seem to have so little confidence in their pizza crust that they serve a side of marinara with it. Why? to take away the taste? If you like gobs of cheese, and tons of tasteless, miss-matched kitchen-sink-style toppings (one on the menu is boasted at weighing 4 pounds), sure, go for it. I'll stick to Lamp, where it's light, clear, well-combined simple Italian flavors, reasonable prices and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Listen... it's father's day... he wanted pizza... I was like \"let's try some thing new\"... here is where we came... we've been at dive bars all night... the fries at Roadhouse left me more satiated... the server was a sweet young girl that pretty much left us alone... that's why they got at least 3 stars... never checked back about the pizza or the 'meh' salad we got... ummm wait she just checked back... I'm not trying to be an A$$ but, this is average... sauce is not terrible on the pizza... BUT... THE CRUST it's been laying down all day... you get me?  The salad.  I went to put on the dressing and had to drop the container because it LITERALLY burnt me... dressing?  Burning me??? Jiminey Crickets... anywho... it's Meh... so... we got ourselves a margarita pizza... (read: tomato sauce, cheese, basil) is it worth $34.00? Uh NO WAY! I made him pay...
 So, make a choice... big boy pants... Try it... prove me wrong"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed with my experience here during the Taste of Cave Creek event.  I went to grab a glass of wine at Brugo's and the lady working made fun of the way I pronounced Malbec (I pronounced it mahl-bec).  The pizza was okay but I definitely won't be back due to my awful experience at this event."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and honest in their opinions giving recommendations.  While I did not try many menu items, I would suggest sticking with pizza as this is their main focus and it was excellent.  I had their version of meat lovers.  The crust was baked to perfection and toppings were generous.  The red sauce hinted of garlic and was also very nice."}
{"text":"We r super excited that one of our local favorite restaurants has re-opened!  Much better location than El Pedregal!  Amazing food, great service and awesome atmosphere!  Congrats!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it was steady with customers, the service was very good and professional! The pizza was very good and the choices of gourmet pizza's is awesome, not what you see at most pizza \"parlors\". The large pie will run you $30.00 but this is gourmet pizza as stated on the sign, this is not your cheap run down pizza place! The decor is very well done with large comfortable booths and upscale! If you are looking for a Peter Piper type place on paper plates with tons of crowd noise this place is not for you! If you want a quite, comfortable, gourmet type pizza, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had tried Brugo's a few times at El Pedregal before it closed and really enjoyed it. We were happy when they reopened in Cave Creek. 

We've been there a few times now and while we enjoy the pizza and salads, especially the house sweet/spicy Italian dressing, the service is atrocious and is getting worse!   I'm not sure why they appear to be incapable of hiring or training a capable, friendly, or efficient wait staff?  Other restaurants in the area, Indigo Blue for example, has an excellent wait staff and their young bus personnel are really good and well trained!

The owner of Brugo's I believe is passionate about her business, but if they don't improve the service, they'll start to lose business, especially my patronage. 

I'm out!!!"}
{"text":"Carl my husband and I Mary,  We live close by Cave Creek a 20-minute drive. We just love the way Chrissy the owner takes the time to say hello during her busy day making sure everyone Is enjoying their meal's and drinks. We Love Love the Chrissy Lasagna dishes. The Pizza looks so good as we see people enjoying the slices. The ambience of the restaurant Is very comfy and love the Frank Sinatra music. Happy hour has great dishes and drinks and love the wine list. We give it a 5 star. A gem In Cave Creek Az."}
{"text":"Super Bowl Sunday didn't leave many restaurant choices.  We were actually trying to go to Indigo Crow, but they were closed.  We saw a pizza place open so my guest and I thought we would check it out.  We weren't looking for a big night, just a couple glasses of house wine and share an appetizer.  Boy did we make a BIG mistake!  We really didn't look at ALL the prices because we thought, \"Hey, it's just pizza!\"  We saw a pizza, called Chrissy's Favorite, that looked pretty good but asked if we could have it on the crust of a different pizza, The Cefalu.  They both were the same price, a Medium 12\" $22.50 (for 2), which is crazy in the first place, right?  Nooooooo!  When we got the bill, the pizza, that was the size of a dinner plate,was $29.00!  They had up charged us $6.50 to switch the crust!  The waiter never said a thing about the additional charge!  Geez!  In addition, our HOUSE white wines were $15.00 a glass!  Now I drink wine all the time and house wines are usually around $9.50.  They boasted how authentic their pizza was and that they import, \"special\" cheese.  The only authentic thing about the pizza was that it was round and had toppings.  Probably the worst pizza I ever had.  I am Sicilian and grew up in New York.  Maybe this pizza is authentic in, Yuppieville?  If you want overpriced bland pizza, this is the  place for you!  If you want a REAL slice of, \"authentic\" Sicilian pizza?  Go to Basil and Garlic Bistro in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Got sat down and watched the waitress seat two other parties, take drink orders,clear a table and bring another table thier food all without our drink orders being taken. The only thing we were able to order was a kids dinner and an appetizer. That order took an excessive amount of time. Decided to get up and leave and after we walked out the door the waitress came out the the door with plate in hand and told us cheesy bread takes 20 minutes. Overall bad service and unprofessional to come out the door like that."}
{"text":"Not at all pleased. Service was terrible. My food tasted like leftovers. Chicken was dry, very little sauce and that had a sour flavor. Told server, she said \"you are the first one that has ever complained\"  Based on reviews, I don't believe her."}
{"text":"Great wine deal on Wednesday evening!  This place is great with its large shaded patio, open bar to the outside and delicious food!  We were sad to see some very unhappy lady came in with a problem not related to this restaurant this evening.  She made a scene.  Needless to say, everyone in our proximity was enjoying their dinner and did not let her affect our great evening.   Thanks to Chrissy for handling the busy crowd and an enjoyable evening.   Jill"}
{"text":"I am specifically updating my review based on the arrogance of the side bar messages the owner is sending me. This will be my ONE AND ONLY response, as I feel the other users of this app should get an accurate description and then they can make there own conclusions... 

Owner claim: \"I am a cyber bully\" : I am somewhat active on Yelp. I review positive and negative experiences (just look at my reviews) when I feel the need as that is the intent of this app and forum ... to share experiences. Look at the pictures that are posted of the message conversation from the owner. Look at the other 1-star reviews. I wonder if those people were contacted like this? ... Seems to me they had similar experiences to mine. 

Owner claim: \"WE HAD JUST OPENED AT 4:30 AND YOU WALKED IN AT 4:45!\" : First, open for business means just that. Its show time. There is no in between. 

Now for the actual events ... When I walked in (4:40), the place was empty with exception of two woman sitting at the bar. No Staff in view. Certainly not the owner who was pointing out what time I entered the door. I wondered throughout the place then returned to the hostess stand where I stood looking over the menu waiting to be greeted. A few moments later, a gentleman came out, no \"Hello, I'll be right with you\" or other form of greeting. He set the food down in front of the women at the patio bar and then proceeded to make drinks then go back to the kitchen, still no greeting. Time is ticking by at this point. Just as I was about to leave (4:56 ... Its funny how focused on time one becomes when they are having a bad experience), a women came up and asked us if we had been helped. I said no and she did seat us on the patio. 

Now for the rest of the story. After being seated, we were asked if we wanted drinks and we asked for lemons for the water and lemon-aids for two of the kids. Specifically in kids cups. \"No problem\" we were told. Yet she returned with the lemon aids in adult glasses because \"We have to pay the adult price anyhow, so you might as well get the full glass\" and hands my wife a single, plastic mixed drink cup telling us \"we can divvy it up however we liked\". Well, we couldn't divvy it up with one cup, nor was that the desirable way to serve the beverage. She stated she would be back to take our order. We looked over the menu and decided on the entrees for the kids and the calzone for me and my wife. We wished to order a medium, 3-topping calzone and were informed it would take 40 minutes. I said \"40 minutes is a long time\" thinking I've had deep dish served in less time...she said \"they were good but takes a long time to cook, maybe one of the pizza's would be a better option, they are quicker because they are \"pre-made\" so they cook faster\". Just what we wanted, Pre-made pizzas at a premium price. We decided it was time to go and paid for the drinks. 

BTW, for technical accuracy of the events, the bill was $6.56. I handed the waitress $10 and she returned me $7, short $0.44. The value is insignificant, She didn't mention that she could not make change, didn't even say a word about it. The principle of the approach is what irritates me. At that point I felt it best to remain being polite and just leave. 

Bottom line for the Owner: Perception is reality, the sooner you realize that, the better off you will be. Being argumentative to a guest via private message, is not the way to \"make right\" the situation. If you would have asked some questions about my experience or seemed remotely interested in being non-confrontational, suggested I call you to discuss, etc... my response and approach would have been different. You came guns blazing telling me why I was wrong, when you didn't even care what your part was. I wasn't having a bad day, my patience with incompetence had just worn thin and I exercised my right to politely leave and share my poor experience. Sorry you don't like it, but its not MY job to provide the customer experience. And as you said, \"... in ten years here only the unhappy write here\". You're right, you scribbled all over my private messages with un happy thoughts and your behavior is quite unprofessional. 

Bottom line for the Reader's: I stand by my original review. The service is slow and they are over priced. They want the status of \"Owning a restaurant\" but don't want to put forth the real effort of attraction and enhancing our experiences in order to make it happen. Keep going, you will get a much better meal and experience at any one of the other 20+ restaurants in Cave Creek / Carefree just down the road. I'm glad I did, the fried chicken at the Horny Toad is pretty darn good. (There is a silver lining in every cloud)"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Brugo's Pizza was absolutely delicious. We're visiting town, and I'm eating there again before we leave. The staff was so friendly, great decor, off the charts menu, and it's super clean. Try the BraveHeart or the Chicken Garlic"}
{"text":"Let's face it, my wife and I love pizza.  We've both traveled the world, having pizza everywhere along the way.  I actually grew up in a little town in NY named Rome, home of the world series of bocce. I know a little about pizza growing up with first, second and third generation Italians. The wife makes a great pan pizza, but sometimes we just need to eat out.  So we were obviously excited to try this local restaurant out, and ditch the chain restaurant down the road. 

When we arrived at 5:30, we were greeted by the owner, I expect, a little gruff - maybe it had been a long weekend.  We asked about the happy hour drink specials, which ran until 6pm, but were told happy hour was over, and it only worked at the bar.  (wasn't too busy, and she was tending the bar as it was anyway)  OK, I guess, let's just stick with water. 

We ordered a gourmet pizza and a couple of salads.  The greens were fresh, but the Caesar dressing tasted a bit too much like mayonnaise. I understand they have a similar base, but the base for Caesar dressing isn't mayo.  The salads otherwise were a bit overpriced for half servings. 

When the pizza arrived, we were - in short - disappointed.  If I were blindfolded and had to guess, it was bought and brought from the nearest New York pizza department restaurant. The most flavorful thing on it was the crushed red pepper from the shaker on the table.  That is honestly the last place I had something that disappointing. Funny, I said to my wife beforehand even bad pizza is good, but I may have been mistaken. 

Well shucks, we'd really love nothing more than a good, local pizza joint.  Maybe next time.  The icing on the cake was when we went to warm up the leftovers, the pizza was shoved in the box and folded over on itself to get it to fit.  It's almost as if they don't want new customers, not even locals :("}
{"text":"For our first visit to Brugo's I will give it a 3. We only had pizza and drinks so don't feel right giving it more or less. We had a thin crust pizza and we really liked the crunch of the crust.... it was one of the specialty pizzas and I don't remember the name of it.... it was white with bacon and chicken. I almost feel there was too much bacon; I know you usually complain about not enough toppings but that is about all I could taste. My other complaint is when you are paying $11 for a glass of wine, I want a spot free glass (well, actually whenever I drink wine)... my glass had many water spots and maybe a smudge of leftover lipstick. We sat at the bar and the bar server was average. We hope to be back to try another pizza in the future."}
{"text":"We like their new location. We also love the thin crust sausage pizza. It is great!  

Yelp says this review is too short so including this to get it posted because we really like this place.  Best pizza by far in the Cave Creek area."}
{"text":"Stopped by on  a Saturday nigh We needed a table for seven.  they said they could not accommodate us because they had reservations. There was a table for 12 that was reserved for 7 o'clock and although we assured them we would  gone by seven they refused  to give us the table. They said it takes people two-hours to eat. They Were not concerned that we said we needed to be out of there by 630. 

They really made no attempt to try to accommodate us.

Have always had great service there before but we're very disappointed this time."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant!! Great ambience and a hidden gem in the desert!! So many items on the menu that it calls one to return to discover more of this families traditions. Loved it!!!"}

{"text":"Well, I really enjoyed the owners' previous restaurant, Guido Garcia's, because I love Mexican and DH loves Italian, so it was the best of both worlds, but I think it was just a great concept in a bad location (the Death Valley of Carefree's Spanish Village).  

Usually, we do carry-out pizza from Brugo's.  On average, this not-a-pizza-lover says it's pretty good.  Sometimes it's sublime, sometimes it's like \"who made this\"?  So consistency can be an issue.  But mostly, pizza-loving DH is really happy.  In-house service is the same way---sometimes right on point, sometimes a bit slow,  but the servers are always so warm and pleasant that you don't mind waiting a little bit.  Plus when dining in, the restaurant is beautiful, the music fun, and you always see friends to say hi to.  It really feels like a neighborhood gathering place, but I don't think a visitor would feel uncomfortable.

Nice wine selection and cocktails.

The owner says the Italian recipes are all old family recipes, and you can tell, according to my half-Italian husband.  He loves the lasagna, adores the chicken parm and I think the meatball any-thing is excellent.  (I do love meatballs.)

I really enjoy their Gorgonzola Chicken salad---that's what I order most, with a Caprese starter.  The Caprese rocks.

The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the calamari.  Total food service quality rings and always overcooked.  BUT---if you have room---you got to try the Spumoni.  It is sooooo good.  It's worth taking some of your meal home just to leave room for it.

Bueno apetito!"}
{"text":"Always great food, great wine, awesome desserts, and fun ambience! Best pizza in Scottsdale--and we are from Chicago and should know! Can't wait to come back next week!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time on a Monday night, it was very busy but the service was great! My wife ordered a Chicken Garlic pizza which was excellent, and I ordered a custom Sun Dried Tomato and Red Onion with spicy sauce that was really tasty! The crust is really good and they have half price beer on Tuesday night and half price wine on Wednesday."}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat. 
We sat at the bar and looked at the extensive menu.  Great pizza selections. 

They also have a great selection of beer on tap.  I had the rye. 
Stop in!"}
{"text":"We like to support local business. I don't think we will be going back. The calamari was just rings and the breading was thick and hard. The meatball pizza was lacking flavor. My husband liked the meatballs. The chicken italian sausage lasagna was the highlight. I could tell right away their sauce is old school. I personally don't care for the heavy foods but my husband really enjoyed  it. My Italian Margarita was off balance. The owner is very nice. The decor is beautiful and we enjoyed the old school music."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant last night.  Dissatisfied to say the least. Walked in to find 85% of the tables we open with reserved cards on every table. Sat at the bar for an hour wait while all these tables remained unoccupied.  While at the bar we order appetizers three of the four made it. We wanted to try the calamari but this never arrived.  

Staff was friendly but restaurant not very well run. Who allows every table to be reserved at 7:00 pm with no one there. 

No need to go back"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now. We've enjoyed a nice glass of wine and a tasty full pizza during happy hour at the bar with Patrick. Relaxed. Plan to be a regular. The Alfranco (?) pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time and we were surprised at how good the pizza was. The crust is not your New York Style but more of a bread like texture but it tastes good. Service was good and there is a huge selection of beers to choose from. We will try some other dishes since we are going back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent! Can't beat Happy hour! Best pizza we've found in Arizona so far!  And Steve sings Well be back for a full on dinner!!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax with a bottle of wine (half price on wednesdays) and a pizza.  Hubby loves their crust.  I think it is too thin, even the regular one is too thin for me but the garnishes are yummy.  Service is always good too."}
{"text":"Awful! We had the special, Chicken Marsala. The chicken cutlet was full of grease and there was absolutely NO taste of Marsala. My eight year old didn't even like the noodles. What kid doesn't like noodles??? There was no taste to it at all. We eat a lot of Italian and this was the blandest meal I have ever tasted. The first thing that came to my mind was, this place needs to be on Kitchen Nightmares. They need to revamp their entire menu. And if the Chicken Marsala is any indication of what the other week day specials are like...I would choose another place. Even the pizza was marginal."}
{"text":"New location. Pizza is consistently good. I am from Chicago so I bring he high standards to the desert. I have been buying Bruno's pizza for the past 4 years when I vacation in carefree and they offer a new twist on a usually usual pizza."}
{"text":"I really like this pizza place. They have a great antipasto salad and I love their garlic chicken pizza. They also have my favorite tangerine beer on tap that I haven't found anywhere else. The service can be a bit slow but the taste and ambiance make up for it. Everyone that works there is very friendly and I like that they have cards and poker chips on the table to play with."}
{"text":"Unbelievable  We thought we would try this place and dine in this time. We walked in and stood at the counter for 10 minutes and NOBODY greeted us!  One man started helping 2 men who appear to have picked up some pizzas to go and apparently had trouble since a 2 minute transaction took 10 minutes. No eye contact. No communication.  People lining up behind us only to find they had no seats?  Wtf?  It's occasions like this when I will be laughing in the summer when their business fails. The sheer arrogance of these businesses is phenomenal!   While we stood there we saw no greeter, no waitresses other than a woman carrying a cocktail. They appear to be understaffed and not prepared for large volumes of people. Wind the clock back to last summer when my wife and I bought a take and bake pizza from this place. It was extremely overpriced at about $35!  We got in the car and drove to The Carefree Inn and got greeted immediately, top notch service and a nice quality meal. Brugo's was good El Pedegral but this new location sucks. Avoid."}
{"text":"Good, but overpriced pizza. The service was delayed, unorganized and very subpar. The appetizers and salads were uninspired and looked like off the grocery shelf food. Nothing to go out of your way for..."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Cave Creek and I was excited to try Brugo's pizza. Unfortunately, we were not impressed. Although the place has nice, friendly staff, the food itself was the disappointment. We ordered a veggie pizza, the meatball sliders, a tomato/mozzarella/basil dish, and a couple of salads. First the sliders, if you can call them that. The meatballs were tiny (about the size of a large marble) and tasted like the sauce was store bought. The pizza was way less than I expected, especially for the price.  Just really disappointed in the crust and the way it was cooked. 

Overall, for the price and location we expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Second trip up here and it was wonderful!  Had the fettuccine Alfredo and added chicken and it was amazing!  I absolutely love the environment and atmosphere here!  An upscale feeling and fine dining feeling but with playing cards on each table for some fun!  Becoming a favorite now!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to the new location. The restaurant is both beautiful and comfortable. The staff is like one big family and you feel part of the family when you are there. Great Italian food. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. My wife had the special, Chicken Marsala. Both were excellent. A great local place."}
{"text":"very disappointing night a Brugo's. It was Saturday night and there was six of us in our party. For a Saturday night the place never got crowded, and I can understand why. We all ordered individual pizza's and they came out only warm and very dry with spar ingredients. Along with all that the service was very poor. On two occasions people ordered additional drinks and in both cases they forgot to bring them out. The server came back 15 min. later and asked if we had ordered more drinks. We told him yes although forget at this point. With as few people that were in the place you would think they would have been more attentive. The Pizza itself for the high price you pay just isn't that great. Will not return for sure."}
{"text":"Food was excellent  but service was beyond horrible.  Waited 15 min after seated and stll no one approached our table.  Kerry finally came over to us and said she would be back.....still waiting...lol.  Asked to see the manager- and was told thay he was the host- manager and a server....what a joke.  Never ever again!!!  Go elsewhere......"}
{"text":"Had heard some good things so decided to try it out.  Went early on a Friday night and the place was pretty full already as Happy Hour was wrapping up at the bar.  Were seated promptly with menus and waters.  I liked the atmosphere and noise level, the high back booths dampen the sound and make it feel more upscale than your average pizza joint.  Decided to split a calamari appetizer and a small hand tossed Franktown pizza.

Pros:  excellent crust, good amount of cheese, nice smoky bacon on pizza

Cons:  wine list limited, uninspired, and overpriced.  Beer list more expansive, and a bit more reasonably priced, but still a bit high.  Calamari was strangely uniform in size and coating and while cooked well, was pretty bland.  Pizza was good, but not great, needing more seasoning, and also overpriced at $14.50 for a personal size.  We also noted that other tables ordering larger sizes ($25 for medium and $32 for large) seemed to get the same amount of toppings as the small, just spread over a larger area.

Bottom  line:  Good,  not great and overpriced"}
{"text":"We had a great time as a family and really enjoyed the pizza.  Having a deck of cards and poker chips on the table was an unexpected surprise.  The pizza was a bit pricey, but overall a great place to go."}
