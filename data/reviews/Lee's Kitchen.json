{"text":"Best Chinese take out in the area.  We always include Singapore noodles in our order. Food is always consistent and we have never been disappointed.  Closed Mondays."}
{"text":"Awesome food -- there are many places closer, but Lee's always gets my $$$ -- the food is good and hot , always fresh, and always good."}
{"text":"The value is one of the best. We usually come here for their seafood chow mein platters ($15, enough for 2 hungry people) - one of the best we've ever tried. We used to go to a Scarborough take-out spot for chow mein but Lee's is closer and a lot better. The taste has gone down a bit over the past couple of years - if you asked me to rate them 2 years ago, Lee's would get a 4 stars.   They also have nice lunch specials for 1 that taste pretty good and are good in value for under $10.   I recommend Lee's. The store itself isn't the prettiest but you come here for take-out - not dine-in."}
{"text":"The best little family run Chinese food restaurant in Markham. This is really only for take out. There are two small tables in the waiting area, but it's mainly take out or delivery only.  I've been going to this location since they opened many years ago. Always great food.  I have friends from Toronto and Vaughan that will drive to Markham for Lees Kitchen take out."}
