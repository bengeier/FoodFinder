{"text":"With the exception of the waitress (who was friendly and very nice), our experience here was terrible.

The bread was both warm and stale (how they managed to do that I don't know), and an Italian restaurant needs to have great bread.

The pizza I ordered (margherita) was decent: good cheese, but stale crust. 

The place was too warm (they supposedly have AC, but it didn't seem to be working), and the acoustics are awful (my ears are hurting because the party three tables away from us had very loud people).

I def won't be back, which is a bummer since I live close to it."}

{"text":"One of the worst Italian restaurant I have ever been to. Terrible service. 
Waiter did not know anything and justified by being there after only two days. My friend ordered a glass of white wine and they brought him a Rose. His wife specifically requested a pasta with no shrimp, and they brought pasta with shrimps, and then probably just reheated the same plate and took them out. Terrible beef carpacho and my pasta was cold. 
I am not a cook, but honestly I can invite you to a much better pasta at home. Do not recommend this place at all. Did not expect this in Toronto mid town, for the price we paid, was completely a waste."}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed a couple date nights here. Friendly staff, delicious food, (the cornish hen practically melts in your mouth) and a wonderful ambiance. We'll surely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Mouth-watering Spaghetti Carbonara. The Spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and there was the right amount of every ingredient in a Carbonara. This is my new go to spot for pasta in the city."}
{"text":"Florentia has fast become one of our favourite Italian restaurants in the city. 

Right from our first visit, the manager, Tino made us feel right at home. Decent wine list (I stick to one or two reds I fancy), and the bread they serve comes with a gorgeous black olive tapenade and is always fresh tasting and delicious.

We've tried a few salads (the grilled calamari can be a tad underdone), pastas, pizzas (The Diavola is good, especially when you sprinkle some of their homemade and VERY spicy scotch-bonnet chilli oil on it) and their a la carte main courses. We've yet to be disappointed, and if you can get it, the Osso Bucco is one of the best I've had in a while. The desserts are good, and they brew a pretty solid cappucino."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at Florentia. We enjoyed our food. The service was responsive and friendly. I would go again."}
{"text":"Had the bruschetta on homemade focaccia bread - good but needed salt.
Spaghetti with clams was bland and pasta was overcooked, I barely touched it. 
All in all, not a very good meal."}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant for Summerlicious and chose this one, somewhat randomly.  We didn't have reservations, but were able to have a  seat.  We had a most incredible meal:  vegetable soup, sea bass and dessert.  All were done in the Florence way, which is healthy and very tasty!  I could eat this meal every day for weeks, it was so good!  

The staff was amazing!  It felt like we were part of the family and they are all from Florence, so the effect is quite authentic.  The staff is also very knowledgeable about the wines they offer and if you take their recommendations, you will not be disappointed.

I was so impressed with this meal that I chose to join yelp to give them a good review.  Give them a try... I think you'll like it!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to go every weekend for dinner. Since the italian boys joined the restaurant, everything changed. The food was fresh, ambience was nice and they were always very welcoming. I would always stop by to have a chat over a cold beer. Since the beginning of the year I have noticed they were not around anymore and every time I would ask where the italian boys were, I would get the answer: \"Oh, they are in Italy\".
For my surprise, last week I ran into Enzo's wife and found out they left Florentia in january. That's why the food is so different. Now I understand why that place is not the same anymore. Too bad. This place had fresh and authentic italian food for a short period of time. I will never forget the ravioli with shrimp. I can't wait to hear from them soon. They made my family weekends memorable. Florentia is not the same anymore."}
{"text":"Very quaint restaurant with a simple menu that can delight just about anyone.  I much prefer this place over Positano's, which is another outstanding Italian restaurant on Mt. Pleasant."}
{"text":"I was so thrilled when i heard my book group would be dining at an Italian restaurant. I had visions of homemade fresh pasta & hand carved chicken cutlets. So mouthwatering.....i could just taste it. Was i ever wrong. Nothing fresh or homemade in this restaurant.

I ordered the chicken cacciatore followed by the tiramisu. The owner began by bringing out 2 plates of bread and a side each of olive oil for dipping (for a table of 15).....there was only enough bread for 1 slice each. The olive oil was absolutely tasteless - I question whether it really was olive oil or just canola oil.

Then we waited an hour for the main course. Others that had arrived later, were served, had finished their dinners, and were actually walking out the door, before we even got ours. 

The cacciatore dinner was arrived with a side of pasta. The pasta was supposed to be spaghetti but instead it was just a hot mess. All sorts of shapes & sizes...it looked like the remains of various types of pasta, and the worst of it was, the pasta was gummy (a serious sin). To top it off the sauce was placed in blobs and tasted like tomato paste.

The chicken cacciatore was not chicken, it was a very cheap cut of leathery veal with a square of cheese on top (think Kraft slice) and on top of the cheese was a small blob of that tomato sauce/paste.

The dessert, tiramisu was not homemade either, no ladyfingers soaked in chocolate/coffee liqueur, just a bland square, one that you can purchase from your local No Frills grocery freezer.

A very disappointing experience. It's a cozy little restaurant in a nice location, too bad the food experience is so disappointing. Save your money & don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"We were attending a movie screening, so I Googled to find a restaurant close by for a nice dinner beforehand. What a pleasant surprise! Clean,  welcoming  and very good food. Our waiter was only four days in but was so friendly and attentive.  We had to move tables initially because of a very bright light in my eye, and I found the music a bit too loud. Other than that, great experience! Try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to try their Winterlicious menu. Small family Italian restaurant, just like ones you'd find in Europe! All entrees came with a Chef's pasta of the day, really wished they gave more pasta cause it was really good! Dessert was amazing as well, the tiramisu was exquisite with flavour except the tiramisu portion was just a bit small, but the creme brûlée was just perfect! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I came here about a week ago for a family lunch, we were starving so we decided on florentia as it was the first place we came across in the neighborhood. We were surprised as we were the only people there at about 1 on a Saturday. I ordered a margerita pizza and everybody else ordered different pastas. We had soups to start (kale and bean) which were the best part of the meal however being way too salty. The pastas were clearly not home made and the sauce was from a can, the pastas all had carrota, broccoli and other random vegetables that would not be found in a typical italian pasta.

My pizza was okay, besides being oily, it was about equal to a pizza from pizza hut. The service was average, and the atmosphere is okay. 

If youre looking for unauthentic italian food, id recommend here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, well-executed food - and welcoming of a multi-generation family with a toddler. They made a complimentary little bowl of pasta with butter and tomato sauce, just for him. 

My veal was tender and very good, though could have used a bit more Marsala in the sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious, and we would definitely come back. Amazing service, and the food was just as good. Very quaint and small but clean and table settings were professional. The tiramisu was incredibly good, also tried the panacotta (very refreshing). For antipasto, we had the cold soup and the salad with cheese (forgot the name), both were good and the presentation was great. For mains we had margarita pizza and the penne ala vodka, no complaints for those either, the mains were delicious."}
{"text":"We are new to Toronto and wanted some good Italian food.  Well we found it at Florentia on Mt Pleasant.  Excellent service and great food made our evening one to remember!"}
{"text":"I don't write updated reviews, unless there is a compelling good reason. I went there for dinner last weekend and they recognized me from the last time!  They remembered which wine I ordered, and pointed it out, and everyone was very friendly and welcoming, including the chef.

To say I was impressed, would be an understatement. I enjoyed being treated well.

I ordered the yelp check-in offer, which is a HUGE bruschetta best be shared, unless you don't have lunch and have only eaten breakfast, in that case, it will be fine. I ordered the ravioli with leek & goat cheese, in bolognese sauce. It was so rich and filling.

I enjoy knowing I am a regular at a great restaurant and will be returning!"}
{"text":"On my first visit recently, I loved everything about this place. The food, the wine, the selection (food and wine), the service, the ambiance, the sound level...Perfetto!!!

Authentically Italian!!! 

Quite frankly, I can't wait to return real soon."}
{"text":"SERVICE: 10/10. Courteous and friendly with a smile. No complaints whatsoever.

FOOD: 2/10. I have no idea who is the chef, but he's / she's clearly not inspired or paid enough. My wife and I were disappointed by the quality of food at Florentia. The Funghi salad she ordered was not worth $12 at all. There was a small piece of cheese in it when she clearly asked the waiter to make sure the salad has absolutely no cheese in it. My $13 Margherita pizza was one of the worst I've ever tried. The dough was atrocious, overcooked and not of the quality you'd expect from an Italian restaurant.

Another good indicator of quality was the bread they served at the beginning. The bread was warm but stale. That was a first red flag. In sharp contrast, Grazie Restaurant (2373 Yonge St) serves super fresh, soft and flavourful bread they receive daily from an Italian bakery in Toronto. Now THAT'S how you treat your customers.

My advice to you would be to do yourself a favour and go to either Positano (633 Mt Pleasant Rd), Viva Napoli Pizzeria (679 Mt Pleasant Rd) or Lil' Baci (2013 Yonge St). All of them are within walking distance from Florentia and serve MUCH BETTER food.

I hope the owner of Florentia either replaces the chef in the kitchen or raises his / her pay to motivate that person to care about the quality of food served to customers. I cannot imagine how someone who loves food and loves to treat customers to nice food would ever settle for such miserable quality of their work. It's beyond me.

Florentia, you failed to make a good first impression and as a result, I won't be coming back."}
