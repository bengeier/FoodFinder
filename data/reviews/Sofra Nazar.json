{"text":"Not friendly; bought 20 dollar dinner plate just to get barely any food. Rude staff with attitude"}
{"text":"Stopped off at the end of a work day and got a chicken sharwma to go. It was so good! The toppings are so fresh and flavorful. I got it with everything and they put this fried eggplant on it too - so delicious! Great place for a quick meal or to take to go. Nothing fancy but they're quick and friendly and the food is delicious! And the portion is huge! You get alot for a great price!"}
{"text":"Probably the best shawarma in the city (because they don't charge extra for toppings and they have more toppings than anywhere I've been) and at the best prices. A huge shawarma wrap is $7.90.    BUT one crabby staff member can ruin it all. The staff are really nice (all family) but there's one guy there (who I think may own part of the place) that if you happen to catch him on a bad day, you may not feel like going back. He doesn't care if you know he's pissed and it doesn't help that he looks like an old history Greek warrior to begin with (think Spartan).   I love their food, the place is always clean and they're always pretty quick to serve but it's just that one guy."}
{"text":"Sofra Nazar is possibly one of the best Lebanese/Mediterranean style restaurants in Toronto.  They offer falafel, shawarma, tabbouleh, kebabs, and other typicial foods found at Lebanese style restaurants.  The restaurant itself is physically accessible to enter, but I can't remember if the bathrooms are.  The bathrooms are gendered.  The food CAN cater to vegetarians and vegans, but vegans may need to avoid the sauces.    My fiance is one of the pickiest eaters I know.  He doesn't generally trust restaurants in terms of hygiene and quality control.  He's worked in the food and beverage industry for a while, so he knows the ins and outs.  He's loves Sofra.  I feel like we've tried most Shawarama places in the general downtown area and Sofra ranks highest in my opinion.    Sofra's food is consistently amazing!  The quality and freshness of ingredients is terrific!  The chicken is always tender, the sauces are all flavorful without being greasy and even the iceberg lettuce salad is well garnished and delicious.     The ambiance of the seating area of Sofra is not my favourite.  It's not Sofra's fault, it's just more of a take out place than a sit-down place. They also offer delivery, either directly through the restaurant if the owner is there, or through Door Dash.  Sofra is the best Shawarma delivery option in Toronto in my opinion."}
{"text":"I got a shwarma once and it was ok but the toppings are gross. DO NOT get the Falafel!!! 3 fallafel balls that have no seasoning, burnt on outside and just gross. Falafel was $7 and, as much as I hate wasting food, I had to throw it away. It smelled bad and the limited toppings were terrible, my wrap was full of stems of cabbage, cut large and not pickled with any flavours. Total waste of money. Aside from that, the server was rude and I saw her handle money then stick her hand in the plastic cutlary...eww"}
