{"text":"I noticed touhenboku logo at Unionville, thought it was ramen shop. Apparently it turned out to be a cafe! I wanted to try their matcha cheese cake, which a lady told me only available at their cafe at limited quantity, but it was all gone for the day I visited. I settled with tiramisu along with iced latte. This was first time I learnt they've been baking all their desserts every day since the beginning of the ramen business, and also sells whole cakes although it's based on reservation. After hearing all stories behind, my tiramisu suddenly tasted sweeter, and I never had latte this rich. I guess I have to keep coming back here more often until I find matcha cheese cake available, because I have positive experience with their moist cheese cake."}
{"text":"I was out today in Unionville and saw a Touhenboku sign.  I love the ramen and was hopeful  they'd opened up another ramenvery.  Alas no ramen,  but they did have the desserts.   I had the cheesecake and my friend had the chocolate cake.  Both were delicious and just like the restaurants.  They have a patio with umbrellas which is a nice place to take a break from walking around Unionville.  If you haven't been Unionville  is freakin' adorable.  It looks like a fairytale or something.  Now on the list of places we take family and friends when they visit."}
{"text":"Will not come back to this place.  My wife and I came in for a slice of cake.  We ordered 1 matcha crepe and please note that no one was in line.  I am not exaggerating here, they literally took over 10 minutes to process my order.  We watched the staff cut the cake and place it into a box.  There was no dancing,  no chit-chat between the staff,  nothing else.  We watched the two things take place and it somehow, impossibly took them over 10 minutes to do this.  The box was nothing special. It was plain white cardboard.   Now as for the actual cake.  That was terrible too, it was a few layers of crepe between thick layers of creme forming a tiny cake. Kensington makes it much better.  $7 for that? Not very good value - not recommended."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  The Good: - Place was clean and service was friendly. - Matcha latte was alright.  The Bad: - Millie crepe cake was creamy but did not have the multiple thin layers you would expect which is the main selling point.   - It was 5 PM and most of the items were not available causing a lot of folks to just walk in and out. Given that they were open till 9 PM you would expect them to have quite a bit of items available.   - The texture of the regular latte was not done right. The froth was partially still in liquid milk form so you end up having a small pool of milk on top.  - We were sitting in the patio area and one of the workers took the trash out passing right beside us. The stench from the garbage was all around our seating area. Definitely not pleasant."}
{"text":"The outside of Touhenboku Cafe was really cute and it was situated in one of the picturesque houses that are characteristic of Main Street Unionville. There was a large patio outside too and a sign that simply asked if you wanted some hot tea, hot chocolate, or coffee. That couldn't have been it, I thought, and I'm so glad we went in to check it out.  We ordered a small hot chocolate, espresso, and a slice of millie crepe cake in vanilla to share. It was too bad they didn't have it in matcha and didn't have the matcha cheesecake either.. They were sold out of that already."}
{"text":"We didn't know Touhenboku has a café branch as well till yesterday we went to Unionville. I always like Touhenboku ramen, so I decided to give this café place a try. They didn't let me down luckily. This place is huge, even has a outdoor area which was perfect for the weather.  We had coconut latte, almond latte, soy latte, Mille crepe for thee of us. Coffee is fresh made of course, and served very quick. Love the Mille crepe! One slice is totally not enough...lol... Make sure you get two slices for each person ;)  Jazz music was also playing at the store, makes a really relaxing Sunday morning vibe."}
{"text":"The ramen for this place was alright so I figure I might as well try out the cafe. The food and drinks at this place was just A-OK to me.  In terms of pricing, I would say it's relatively on the high end or comparable to Starbucks. They serve the drink to you once you order it which is nice.   Drinks -Matcha latte tasted ok. Nothing spectacular about it.  -Hot drinks are quite foamy. If you like your drink to be foamy that's good -Caramel latte definitely had no caramel in it   Desserts are okay. I had the tiramisu and it was good. Just your typical tiramisu :)   The location itself is great. You can sit inside the cafe, or outside and listen to people across the street play some outdoor music. Very calming."}
{"text":"A tiny cafe situated on the busy Unionville Main Street. They have the usual coffee drink selections, although they didn't seem to have decaf coffee available when I was there. Food options are all cakes options: mango mousse, terimisu, japanese cheesecake, regular millecrepe and matcha millecrepe. I had the matcha millecrepe, which was light and airy. The alternative layers of green and white cream between the crepes made for a pretty presentation. My friend noted that most of the cake was made of the cream layers than actual crepe, but it was still good.  Note that it's a tiny space. There are only three 2-ppl tables, one 4-ppl seating arrangement and 5 stools by a bar ledge. That totals only 15 seats inside, so don't come with a large group or you will probably be out of luck. Or come during the warmer months and take advantage of the extra seats on the patio. The service is slow. On a Sunday afternoon, they only had one staff working the till, making drinks and keeping the place clean. She was working hard and was nice, but it was clearly too much for one person to do. There was a long line-up most of the time, and some potential patrons turned around and left. Be prepared to wait, or just walk down the street to Starbucks."}
{"text":"We ordered a Mille Crepe Cake and Caramel Latte.  The crepe cake was quite delicious.  It was beautiful, soft and delicate.  There were layers of crepes with the softest pastry cream in-between.  Although the crepes were not paper thin, we totally enjoyed eating the cake.  Maybe if it were renamed to a layered cake, instead of a crepe cake, it would have been better received.  Sometimes it is all a matter of expectation.  The latte was rich in coffee flavour, but I could barely taste the caramel.  One could easily mistake it as a regular cafe latte.  Though as a regular latte, it would have been a pretty good one.  The services was friendly.  The patio seating and indoor seating were nice."}
{"text":"In the historic setting of Mainstreet Unionville, this small cafe is a nice location for visitors to grab and go with their selection of coffees and teas. Issue I had with this place was its not a very large space and seating were limited. Although I did enjoy the comfy chairs they have set out, the table seems to be set too low for a venue that serves cakes. Therefore while seating was picturesque, it lacked a bit of functionality.  But I guess for place of that size it bods well that people don't linger. The Mille Crepe cake and Latte was good. Generally a nice place to visit on your own or with a friend. not for large groups."}
{"text":"This review is for their DRINKS ONLY! To sum this cafe up, it has mediocre drinks with cute decor. I've been here twice, and both times I was not impressed with their hot drinks and service. One time, we sat down and didn't get our drinks until 10 mins after. So, the drinks were lukewarm and the foam already deflated/sunk. The barista did not call out our order, and we were left waiting... when we asked about our drinks, apparently it's been sitting on the counter 'waiting' for us to pick it up.   The drinks here are mediocre. I almost couldn't tell I ordered an almond latte from the first couple of sips... but some GOOD POINTS about this cafe are: free wifi, decent prices, tables and seats available which are pretty hard to find sometimes in Main St cafes!   All in all, would I come back? Probably not, unless the other coffee shops on Main St Unionville are packed..."}
{"text":"Had the matcha green tea latte a while ago.  Flavour was delicious and balanced but for the size of the drink (small), i could have gotten a larger small in downtown toronto!    Overall, i like the cute, organized and cleat setting and would go back again to try other creations.  May need to be summer though as there are VERY limited seating"}
{"text":"I loved their matcha cheesecake! So smooth and light! Loved the shortbread crust on the bottom. I should have taken a picture but i ate it before I realized I should have. In addition, they have cream puffs which i will try another day! The iced Almond Latte was smooth and with a subtle almond taste, not too overpowering.   The staff are so polite and quick. The decor inside is simple and clean with a modern and rustic twist. The patio is beautiful, they just redid the garden here and it does have a scenic view of The Mills across the street. You are right on Main street Unionville but away from the traffic unlike Fire Hall Confectionary and Boosters patio. For the pokemon players, you can sit here and catch pokemon! Lol"}
{"text":"Super moist & not to mention perfect sweetness of matcha Mille crêpe!!  Will definitely come back again soon!! The latte was good but no art:-("}
{"text":"This cafe is located on the far end of Main Street (with the water mill and train tracks). I appreciated the 3 staff being extremely friendly and that the patio was spacious with around 5 tables. The cafe was very hot and stuffy so the patio was a great alternative.  Drink wise, the iced green latte wasn't anything \"wow\". In fact I think the matcha flavor could be much stronger. My friend ordered the peaches and cream brewed ice tea. The initial sips were bland and almost tasteless. But after swallowing, there was indeed a slight peaches and cream after taste, very slightly. That was pleasant surprise.   The matcha Mille crepe cake was a huge disappointment. The layers were too thick and not fluffy enough. I believe the matcha slice was around $6, which I find rather pricey for the quality and size. My friend had the tiramisu which was nicely made and tasted average."}
{"text":"Went there today for late lunch for the first time. The place was empty and not knowing we entered the building to ask if it was ok to eat outside. \"Sure!\" Came the quick answer so we selected a table and sat.   We waited and waited and no one appeared to serve us.  I saw the staff, at least 3 people, inside chatting but no sign of service.  My wife went in to ask if anyone was help us. The same quick answer \"You order inside\" and back to their discussion.  I was really turned off. No other customers and you can't take the time to interact with them?  Then when they come to you it's as if we are stupid people for not knowing your system.  Sorry, not getting my business and I'm already telling others about your customer dis-service."}
{"text":"I came here a few times to hang out with my friends, and it's definitely a nice place to chill out. There's wifi, comfy seats and just a cozy atmosphere. Everytime I come here I get the cappucchino and it's pretty good, it's the right balance of coffee and milk. I've only tried some cheesecake on the house (there was a promo for free cake with a purchase of a drink) and it was decent, nothing too special though.  I always stop by this cafe when I'm around Main Street because I've had good memories here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I did. However, it failed to meet expectations. Maybe I caught them on an off day. I had the following items:  1. Iced Matcha Latte (12 oz for $4.00): Three times the charm, right? They didn't make it right until the third time. I asked for soy milk but they made it with 2%. Then they gave it to me hot instead of iced. Finally, they got it right. Just to let everyone know, they pre-mix the matcha with sugar but it remains the bitter matcha that I love. I was pleasantly surprised with how bitter it was, but if you're into sweet matcha, this won't be for you. I just hated how it took the 3rd time.  2. Tiramisu ($7.50): This was hyped up by one of my friends and it was probably the worst item. For the price, it's pretty small. Not only that, it was dry. The taste itself also wasn't impressive. Just straight out disappointed. In addition, $95 for the whole cake?!?! No thank you.  3. Matcha Mille Crepe ($7): The size was also pretty small, and in between the layers of matcha cream, there is also vanilla cream. I'm not sure if that's what made it taste just like vanilla and nothing else. I could SEE the matcha powder but didn't taste it. It was very soft however, so I'll give it points for texture.  The servers were nice but they were really slow. I had to wait a long time for my order. It's pretty overpriced for what you get and if you're not rushed, then go ahead and try it out. I like that the iced and hot drinks are the same price because most places charge extra for cold. I also appreciate that they don't charge extra for dairy alternatives, but unless you ask, you wouldn't even know that is an option. I also want to note that there is only one tiny washroom which stores the WET mop which reeked. It was pretty disgusting. That just turned it off for me. The end."}
