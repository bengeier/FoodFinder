{"text":"No bad but not great.  We ordered 4 dishes for takeout.   The beef and broccoli and chow mein were very good, but the salt and pepper seafood was the worst I've ever had and absolutely tasteless.  Perhaps it would have been better if we had dined in."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant in Calgary!  I've been going here (or getting take out)  for around 15 years. They have lots of variety of meat and vegetables.  The ginger chicken is the best... Oh and the pineapple chicken... Oh and the lemon chicken... And the wonton soup.... Oh and the ginger beef... Uh and the special chowmein... And the shrimp fried rice... Mmm and the spring rolls..  It just goes on and on. 

The take out is really fast and tastes great once home. Still piping hot. And they are really helpful over the phone. 

Eating in is nice too. The waiters bustle around and take great care of you. 

Great for the whole family, my kids love the wonton soup and lemon chicken. 

The portion sizes are big too I always get a few meals out of our order. 

The price is great for the value of the food.  You'll need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"We used to live in Hawkwood and ate at what used to be Bills Peking House for years, then it became Hawkwood Palace.  Started ordering for delivery again recently from Varsity and have tried at least 3 times in the past year, with less than satisfactory results.  The food has gone downhill drastically.  The dumplings were doughy and undercooked, the Salt & Pepper Squid was dry, over-breaded, and still looked \"white\", with no taste at all, basically inedible. Last time we ordered a Chow Mein but with no shrimp (we're allergic) and got the shrimp anyway.  Sorry, this place just got crossed off our rotation permanently.  There are way better options at these prices."}
{"text":"We (family of six adults) have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant in NW Calgary for some time. We finally found one tonight! Hawkwood Palace has efficient and pleasant staff. We were pleasantly surprised to see cloth napkins and tablecloths. Decor is a little dated, but very clean.

Their menu offers both Cantonese and Peking cuisines. \"Hot\" items are clearly marked. The vegetables were perfectly crisp and the other entrees were delicious: ginger beef, deep fried shrimp, stir fried mixed veggies, lemon chicken, chicken chow mien (least favourite), wonton soup and hot/sour soup. All this for under $80.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here often over the last 15 years. Food is consistently fresh and tasty. Great for two people, great for larger groups also. Unique lay-out allowing a good dining experience. They offer a dinner for one Cantonese and a dinner for one Peking that gives two people an amazing variety of food and comes in at under $26. Staff is delightful. We have had a couple of occasions where we ordered items on the menu that were listed as appetizers and our plan was to eat them with the main meal. If you do that then let your waitress know you want the items all together. That would be the only time we had a glitch in the service but then realized it was our not understanding how the food would be traditionally served. So, if you want your soup at the same time as your spareribs ... tell them that. Wine list has some great old favorites on it and the price for a bottle of wine is very reasonable. Love going for dinner here and always made to feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place ( fantastic reviews)  for a few years and finally tried it out. I was in the neighborhood and stopped in for some take out.

The restaurant is a bit dated, but like I said I was in for some take out. It wasnt overly busy, but I am sure its because it was begore the dinner rush. Ordered some soup, spring rolls, mixed veggies, fried rice, lemon chicken and ginger beef. I thought I would play it safe since it was my first time here.

Average prices you would find at any Chinese restaurant, so not expensive. My order came in at just under $50.

Everything was ready in less then 20 minutes and I was on my way home to enjoy some Chinese food with my family.

Everything tasted great. Loved the shrimp fried rice and ginger beef the best.

Will try them again and next time will be dine in."}
{"text":"Some places have been around such a long time and must have customers who tolerate bad food, that they must not care if you come back! We were a party of five for my 91 year old fathers birthday dinner...the salt and pepper seafood was so over cooked and still 'white' that it must have been old product. Nobody at the table could eat it! We complained and were told to order it 'softer' next time and then they refused to replace the dish or take it off the bill !  Save your time and money , go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and have always recommend it to friends and family but after last nights experience I'm not so sure I'd ever go back. My mother picked up take out and brought it home, we always order the salt and pepper shrimp (my fave!) but instead they gave us an assortment of seafood (squid, shrimp and scallops) which tasted awful.  Very fishy and rubbery.  So my mother phoned to let Hawkwood palace know of their error (this dish is $14 so a very expensive mistake) and they proceeded to just argue with her!  She even asked them if she should take a picture and send it to them so they would believe us when they made an error on a dish.  I was so mad I wanted to just bring back the entire order!  Yes we ordered shrimp, yes you entered on your system \"shrimp\" but your kitchen or whoever packs up the food made a mistake and gave us the wrong dish.  Own up to the mistake!  Give us our money back or give us a credit to use next time...but there definitely won't be a next time.  You've lost a long time customer all due to your terrible customer service."}
{"text":"First, staff. The gent at the front was the single most polite person I have dealt with at a restaurant. Ever. Kudos to these guys for that.

Food? for the kind of place you're looking at, pretty darn good. The peas in the hot and sour soup actually taste fresh. Ginger beef - a recommended item - had a few overdone stragglers, but clearly this is otherwise a good dish. Loved the chicken and 4 vegetables too.

Price was staggeringly low - I ordered for pickup using cash and a $50 meal for 4 cost me $41.

Will definitely, absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food I have ever had. Ordered ginger beef for lunch. I can't find find any beef in the plate. It is basically a plate of deep fried little dough pieces with some sweet and sour sauce. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering food from here for many years, and like others have said, yes the d√©cor is very dated.  The servers have limited English and are rough with their interactions, but they mean well and its evident they work hard. 

For Chinese food, it is the best I have had in the NW, the prices are competitive, servings at large and the menu is very varied.  There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time this weekend, as we were honoring a loved one who dined here a lot before she passed. The decor is straight out of the 80's, I've honestly never seen napkins in that color before. We arrived to an empty restaurant, but throughout the evening it got quite busy. The servers still managed to tend to our table and ensure we had everything we needed.

The 6 of us (& two children) decided to order the Dinner for 6, with an additional order of Salt & Pepper Squid. The portions are absolutely HUGE, it could have fed 12 people instead of 6. We started off with Spring Rolls & Wonton Soup, after which they brought out our main entrees. I do wish they would bring it all out at once, rather than staggering it, but it was irrelevant towards the end when we were all too full to eat another bite. I'm not sure how good the food would be for takeout, but we really enjoyed it dining in. The standouts were definitely the Sweet & Sour pork and the Ginger Beef! I would skip the squid next time, as it was a little dry, but otherwise no complaints. Everything was so filling but really tasty. 

The servers were very friendly, and the young man taking payment upfront was especially polite. The only thing I didn't like is that they charge for tea. I'll definitely consider this place next time I have a craving for Chinese food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Its been my go-to place for take-out chinese food for many years. The quality of the food is consistent and high quality. If you dine-in, the restaurant decor is dated and hard on the eyes but fine for take-out."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Hawkwood Palace for years and years.  Thought we'd revisit this restaurant again.  This restaurant is tucked away in the Hawkwood residence area where there is a strip mall and a Petro-Canada gas station, just up the road from John Laurie Blvd.  Loads of free parking in the front of the restaurant.

The decor was the same as I remembered - the 80's look with pastel coloured chairs on a split-level.  Along one side of the windows, the 4 seat tables reside.  On the further side of the windows, the bigger tables are located.   The higher level of the restaurant looks outside to the parking lot.  The lower ground level is where the big tables are situated by the kitchen and the tanks that house the lobsters and crabs.  Noticed that most of the customers in the restaurant were not Asian.  Not much a wait at all on a Saturday evening at 6:15 p.m.

We perused the menu and located the Chinese menu items at the back of the menu.  They have set dinners for 4, 6 etc.  There were 2 selections for the dinner for 4 - we chose the cheaper one for $53.88.  The more pricey one which isn't very much more has crab.  We weren't into crab that evening so we opted for the cheaper one.  

The following was included in this Chinese dinner for 4:
- tofu seafood soup - slightly thickened with corn stach - refreshing - seafood - bits of shrimp and squid - the squid was a little tough at some times.
- squid with slivers of celery, carrots, onions, ginger and green onions - plain looking but tasty; a little chewey for the elderly but ok if you have strong teeth :o)
- beef brisket hot pot with star anise and green scallions - great hot pot and very heartwarming dish
-  steamed sea bass pieces with loads of ginger and green onions in a lovely light soya sauce and wine sauce - absolutely my favourite dish!  - watch for those little bones
- deep fried chicken, chopped up.  with a fish sauce and cubed green and red peppers - the chicken was so moist and cooked to the bone.  The skin slightly crispy but softened with the sauce.  There's still a crunch when you go to take a bite.  Great dish!
- rice was included
- cut-up orange for dessert

Pretty darn good price to feed 4 people with so much food!  Wil be back."}
