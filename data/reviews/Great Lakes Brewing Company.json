{"text":"A great spot for food and beers - I'd go again if I was in town.  We headed here for a late lunch on a Wednesday. I was happy to see they make the most of their outdoor space with a ton of tables outside along the street and in a covered beer garden kind of area. We were seated immediately.  Being fans of Great Lakes beer, we decided to get a bunch of smaller tasting sizes. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the beer and food menu and made great suggestions.  To eat, i had the Cuban sandwich and ordered sweet potato waffle fries for a slight upcharge. Both the sandwich and the fries were great - definitely worth it. My husband ordered the fish and chips, and it sort of missed the mark for me. I thought the portion was small, with only 2 small cod filets on the plate. The batter was good though - nice and crispy.  We were too stuffed for dessert, but we did order an Edmund Fitzgerald to sip while we let our food digest.  After lunch, we walked over to the store and made a mix your own 6 pack to take home with us. We were there in mid September, so I was glad to snag some Nosferatu.  I'm not sure if brewery tours are offered, but if so, I'd go. The brewery is just down the street from the brewpub."}
{"text":"Come for the beer, not the food. The food is good, but expensive, salty, and creamy. The beer on the other hand is a gift from above. If you haven't been, get a flight. Sitting outside when its nice is the best way to go. I really like the ground floor bar, but newcomers tend to like sitting in the basement."}
{"text":"Fabulous old-style pub feel. Wonderful experience, and AWESOME beers!!!"}
{"text":"The place is great. Everyone knows it. Good food, great beer. If you can, visit the basement... it's like an old stone Irish pub down there. Gorgeous outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer, great seating. All around best place in Cleveland. The local beers are really good. Food is good too. Good indoor outdoor seating and great staff."}
{"text":"I had a late weekday lunch here with a friend who was in town visiting.  It's October and the weather was unseasonably excellent for Cleveland, so we had the opportunity to sit out on the patio.  I should note at this point that I am not a beer drinker - never developed a taste for the stuff and can barely distinguish an IPA from a doppelbock or a lager.  I chose GLBC because I knew it had a patio, and I have heard great things about their brews from friends who are beer afficionados, and the friend I was with has been known to enjoy a quaff or two before, and I thought she might enjoy trying out the local fare.  We arrived a little after 2p, and the patio was full, due to the aforementioned great weather.  The hostess told us it would be about 15 minutes, and gave us the option of waiting or taking our phone number and calling us when the table was ready ... we opted for the latter and walked across the street to the West Side Market it peruse the stalls for a few minutes.  The call for our table came promptly about 15 minutes after we left, and they didn't have any issue with us taking 5 minutes to get back for our table.  My friend started out with a beer.  She was a little unsure of which to choose, but the waiter did a good job of answering her questions and guiding her to the varietal that would best suit her taste at that moment. She started with the Eliot Ness Amber Lager and quite enjoyed it.  The food at GLBC is fine. It's high end pub food. I have eaten there a number of times and they have what you'd expect: burgers, pizza, fried appetizers, etc.  They also offer a number of more bistro style dishes, but those are all closer to $20 meals.  I ordered the fish and chips for $13. It came with a small side of coleslaw and a tasty homemade tartar sauce.  The fish was beautifully fried, crisp and golden with some interesting flavors in the batter.  I think I tasted rosemary and a hint of curry, but I'm not sure about the latter. The coleslaw was thick cut green and purple cabbage with shredded carrots, and a light, creamy dressing that seemed to have just a hint of horseradish.  She ordered the Killbuck Valley Mushroom Pizza for $11, which came topped with mushrooms, fresh rosemary, leeks, garlic oil, Aderkase blue cheese, mozzarella cheese. I have to give credit to the server at this point, because my friend has difficulty making up her mind about what to order and he did a good job of answering questions and guiding her.  When she asked about the pizza she ultimately ordered he very candidly told her that it was one of the more popular pizzas, but that he didn't care for it so much, because he wasn't a fan of bleu cheese.  I liked his directness in that respect.  It's so annoying when a waiter won't share his or her preference and doesn't help when asked.  The food came out after about 15 minutes, and was hot and nicely plated.  At this point my friend ordered a second beer, and tried the Oktoberfest, which is one of their seasonal beers. Again, she quite liked it.  Here's where my only real complaint comes in.  The waiter who had been so helpful and attentive during the ordering process pretty much disappeared after our food arrived.  I was drinking a soft drink, and he never came by to check if I needed a refill or to see how we were doing with our meals. We were ultimately able to catch his eye, and he got us what we wanted right away, but still I felt that we should have been checked on at least once or twice while we were eating.  All in all, GLBC is fine. I can see why a beer fan would love the place, but for me it's a bit less alluring. I do feel that most of the dishes were about $2 more than they should have been, but I know that there are plenty of people around here who are willing to shell out $12 for a burger to accompany their brew.  In all likelihood, I will be back here the next time I'm with someone who loves beer.  On my own, I'm pretty unlikely to seek it out, but that's more about my food and drink preferences, than any statement about the quality of the food or the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer, 3 stars for the food.   This place is a Cleveland institution, and makes some excellent brews. My personal fave is the Lake Erie monster - smooth and strong!   The food, however, is hit or miss. It's there, but nothing special. With the abundance of top-notch restaurants in Ohio City, pass Great Lakes up if you just want to eat."}
{"text":"GLBC is a Cleveland staple, if in the area you must give it a look. Dortmunder Gold is a staple of NEO.  Pros: -Atmosphere -Price -BEER IS AMAZING  Cons: -Parking"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, before we hit an Indians game. We had the beer sampler and the pretzels, the chacuterie plate, and the sausage plate. We wanted to try the local fare--everything was great; our waitress was attentive and explained the beer selection, and where the food was from. Worth the stop, albeit a tad busy. If you try and go during peak times, it might be useful to try to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Are you a current Clevelander? A homesick native Clevelander? Or a visitor trying to understand why Clevelanders are rabid about their city? Look no further than the GLBC. Whether you are seated inside or on the patios, being in the heart of Ohio City is the perfect hook. Their beers are insanely good (my go-tos are Burning River and Great Lakes Monster). I'm vegetarian and the delicious veggie burger and fries are all I need to balance the ABV in the beer. And be sure to visit the store before you leave. I'll bet you'll walk away with SOMETHING to commemorate your visit."}
{"text":"Delicious beer in a really great pub atmosphere. A solid 4 on the service and food, which was creatively presented and yummy but not over the top. The waiter was almost too prompt with the food and bussing of our table, even though there were plenty of other tables available.   We had our 10 year old with us, and were able to find good choices for him and us. Definitely worth going if you're not in a hurry or if you're looking for reliable American fare."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Milk Stout with bratwurst and pierogies. Delicious dinner"}
{"text":"First off Great Lakes is my favorite brewery. I'm from Buffalo so this is the first time I've visited. It's situated on a really nice, tree-lined street with a huge outside seating area, some of which is covered but most is not. The trees provide great shade in the afternoon sun. Upon entering you instantly notice the character of the building which looks to be built pre-1900. The shop area is really nice and they have a lot of clothing, pint glasses, souveniers, and coolers stocked with fresh Great Lakes beer. There were some styles I hadn't seen in stores in NYS before which was cool (and expected).  The upstairs bar area looks like a turn of the century bar, very old school. It's not a huge area but comfortable enough. Bar staff was very good and friendly. Downstaurs is this really, really cool sort of pub/cellar area. Very dark, very medieval dungeon feel, very cool. There is a second bar down here as well, with multiple tables. You can see the stainless steel brewing vats behind iron gates, as well as barrels of what appear to be beer. I like the downstairs area the best of the whole place, although the patio on a nice day (like it was when we were there) was awesome.  The food menu looked good but we only had a few pints on this visit. I will be back here next time I am in Cleveland. Best Brewpub I've visited to date. World class beer. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love beer? Of course you do! Like to eat? Who doesnt?  Great place to meet friends and have a couple of Great beers that they brew right there. Plus I love the fact that I can hear myself think while i'm there."}
{"text":"Well I've been coming here since they opened.  I remember my buddy and I stopped in to the \"new\" place to check it out.  That was 28 years ago and it hasn't changed much!  The beer is still the standard bearer of local brews and the food is consistently good.  It's not a 5 star restaurant but it is a brewpub so what do you expect?!  I laugh today because one of of buddies said \"they'll never make it\"!  Little did we know this was the start of Cleveland's resurgence!  Great beer, good food!  What else do you need??"}
{"text":"A great craft beer maker. I've had their products back home, but visiting here was nice. I had Burning River and Edmund Fitzgerald. Pretty busy place on a Saturday afternoon.  Since we just stopped in to quench our thirst, I did not have a chance to sample their food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Great tour of the facility, went with a group of 8 people we all licked off our plates. Only downfall is plan your night accordingly bc the tour and dinner took 4 hours!"}
{"text":"Finally brought my husband here for his birthday last night to get Edmund Fitzgerald from the source and to grab dinner. So happy we did! First off, the place is way more adorable than I could have ever imagined! There is something to look at every where you turn. We ordered beers (obviously) and the pub bites to start. DELICIOUS. Perfectly deep fried bits of delicious cod. Then after another round of beers we decided to order our meals - burger for him, chicken pesto for me - both way too amazing and we would for sure order again. Then finally (more beers) and a free dessert because we were celebrating his birthday - THE BREAD PUDDING - either I had too many beers or this was the greatest dessert I've ever had in my life, probably a little of both. Don't forget to stop at the gift shop - SUPER cute and unique souvenirs. We will be back, very soon."}
{"text":"One word- Amazing. Beautiful atmosphere, music, and food. Wonderful variety of drafts and delicious food. Got the 'Nach -ohs' appetizer and it was the best nachos ive ever had. Then got the Chicken Pesto Sandwich and it was perfect. Chicken was Moist. Service was friendly and attentive to any needs."}
{"text":"This was a good, above average Restaurant / Brewery. It felt like a restaurant and less like a Brewery. It is and has been very successful. When does a Micro Brewery loss the title of 'Brewery'. I guess I'm into Micro Breweries where you smell yeast when you walk in the front door. That's not the case here."}
{"text":"Great place to go, the tour is wonderful and it's free, you even get to sample the beer on the tour.  Food is a little over priced but all of it looks good.  The Elliot Ness beer is wonderful"}
{"text":"I love local / micro-breweries. GLBC does a good job of maintaining their year round brews (love Dortmunder) and mixing in their seasonals (Big Black Smoke is a very good Porter and Oktoberfest is just easy to drink). They grow a number of menu items in their own garden - stuffed Anaheim Peppers are great with beer. Very good experience. Located by West Side Market is a bonus."}
{"text":"The Old World Burger at Great Lakes Brewing is a classic BBQ burger. The burger consists of a char-grilled patty paired with smoked cheddar, bacon, fried onion straws, and house-made Edmund Fitzgerald Porter barbecue sauce. All of this is stacked between a pretzel roll that complements the bacon and cheddar very well. The flavors of the burger all come together quite well. However, a too thin and slightly dry patty and bun left this burger with a little to be desired.   If you are looking for great beer, good food, and a burger that will transport you to a backyard BBQ Great Lakes Brewing is your place. It is worth a visit for the beer alone, since Great Lakes crafts some of the best beer in the United States."}
{"text":"This was a great Yelp event! It was very educational because we took a tour of the Brewery, we learned its history, and we learned all the steps and ingredients that go into brewing different types of beers.  In addition to the tour, we got to sample beers! The Burning River Beer was my favorite! And we sampled a lot of delicious sausages, homemade pretzels, different types of Kraut, and some of the most delicious decadent desserts I've ever tasted. The gingerbread cookies, drizzled in chocolate were a cookie lover's dream! And both the chocolate cake and bread pudding tasted homemade, from scratch.   The Yelp Staff held raffle giveaways, for Cleveland Cinema Fest tickets, they gave away movie passes for a \"Heaven Is Real\" Movie Screening, and they gave each guest a nice parting gift."}
{"text":"Great menu, great beers, huge enormous gigantic brewery. Maybe my expectations were too great? I did love that the server told us which menu items featured produce from local farms. I also liked that they had a homemade vegan black bean burger.  But I would have liked it a lot more if it didn't taste like a scoop of refried beans between two pieces of wheat roll. Not very good. The sweet potato fries with honey and herbs were delicious and sticky and a great idea.  But other than that, and the great beer of course, nothing really stands out about the experience. Of course Great Lakes is easy enough to find in Chicago, so I'll make my own burger next time..."}
{"text":"GLBC makes GREAT beer.  Their Eliot Ness Vienna Lager is my favorite, followed closely by Commodore Perry IPA.  Stopped here a few times while on the road and unfortunately won't be stopping again.  Too far off the turnpike for mediocre food.  And even if I was a local I'd probably just stick with getting a six pack from the store.  Atmosphere was very cozy and the staff were very nice though.  But GLBC needs to fire their chef and overhaul their menu.  Call me when you do, please."}
{"text":"This place is a great time. Relaxed, but fun crowd. Beers are a great price with plenty of options. My food was amazing. I got the prosciutto grilled cheese and beer cheese soup. It was perfect. Service was also great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is my fiancé  said his burger was dry and a friend said the butternut squash ravioli was way too salty. My food was great, but others had a couple imperfections. Otherwise, this was an awesome place to go on a cold, snowy evening."}
{"text":"The beer of course is superb. The menu for food is expansive and is good. I had the black bean vegan burger which was really well made."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm a HUGE Christmas Ale fan. Because I haven't lived in Cleveland since before I was of the legal drinking age, every year I am begging family and friends to send me some come November. It isn't the holiday season unless I have my fair share of Christmas Ale.   With that being said, I had high expectations when I went to Great Lakes Brewing Company for a mid day drink and some appetizers. I'd have to say they delivered. I'm an IPA girl myself and I enjoyed the Rye of the Tiger. We sat in the Beer Garden that is like an outdoor patio that was partially covered with a canvas roofing (I assume it is fully covered and heated until the warm summer months). It was a fairly warm day out so the canvas roof was open to allow you to soak up some vitamin D. Since it was mid day during the week (I was on vacation-don't judge) it wasn't too crowded.   We ordered the Pub Bites, which are fried cod. They were good, but what fried food isn't? We also got the Barley Pretzels, which comes with two different types of mustard and a Thousand Island-esque dip. Also decently tasty. Overall, we weren't looking for anything gourmet here, just a few bites to eat and some delicious brews. So Great Lakes hit the spot. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing, not only is their beer delicious but the food is definitely not typical run of the mill brewery food. It is pricey but worth it as the food is delicious and the service is great as well. This is a must try restaurant and brewery for anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I haven't heard of Great Lakes so I was excited that my fiancée and I could go on both a tour of the brewery and have dinner at the pub. Before our tour we had a drinks to get us in the mood. Ryan really likes the Elliot Ness and I went with one of their Holy Moses. I am a fan, much lighter than a Blue Moon and just as tasty.  We took one of the last tours of the evening which ended up as a private tour. Our tour guide was fantastic and quite knowledgeable about the facility. Before entering the brewery she gave us interesting factoids and of the building's history. Who knew a company could be so environmentally conscious? I learned from our guide that GLB reuses some of the by products of the brewing process at the restaurant in things like the cheese dips or the famed pretzel chicken. They even have the Fatty Wagon, a mini shuttle bus that takes patrons from the restaurant to sports stadiums...and it runs on vegetable oil. The restaurant is where the original brewery was and the brewery today is housed on the site of the former Schlater Brewery. The brews are fresh and never kegged. I learned a lot about the beer making process. I even enjoyed out beer tasting which included trying Dortmunder Gold, Burning River, Commodore Perry, and the Edmund Fitzgerald.   The brewpub did not disappoint. During the tour we got a recommendation from our guide to try the pretzel chicken and the sausage platter appetizer. So sure enough we decided to go with those and I also added the butternut squash ravioli. The sausage platter was genius. A sampler of kielbasa, bratwurst, chicken sausage, and smoky red hot with my fave being the the kielbasa. I've had kielbasa before and this was my favorite by far so much so that the waitress even told us which meat vendor to check out at the West Side Market. The ravioli was awesome and tasted so fresh.  Such a fan of the food and the beer. If I am ever on a road trip or in Cleveland I will make sure to come in for good food and even better drink."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland must! The decor is amazing! Now it can be a little busy at times but it is well worth the wait! The Chicken and Bacon Mac and Cheese was very tasty.  If you can ask to be upstairs, do it!! Possibly The greatest thing they do here is use Cleveland vendors! Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"What's really cool about GLB is that they offer free tours on the weekend. You can reserve spots for up to 10 people but we had a larger group so I emailed and they made an exception. The tour was very cool and informative and, the best part (obviously), you get a free beer tasting. Our tour guide was entertaining and knowledgeable. The tour lasts about an hour and then you can get dinner back at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Being such a fan of the beer, I could not pass up the opportunity to actually check out the brew/pub located in Cleveland.    First about the beer - this stuff is epic.  I can't say enough about how much I love their beer.  Eliot Ness is my fav  Now the food - my guest and I ordered two appetizers (their take on artichoke dips and the sirloin tips) and were disappointed with both.  The dip just tasted like ground up banana peppers and the tips tasted like nothing more then chunks of beef with way too much Lawry's seasoned salt on them.  For the price, the quality kinda sucked."}
{"text":"Great beer with pretty good pub food (though the food cannot quite compete with some of the other, more upscale, restaurants in the neighborhood). Lots of fun, excellent service by friendly staff (and I was there on St Pat's day, when W25th becomes fairly crazy and crowded and drive the servers nuts). Informal and friendly, situated in an entertainment district with many nearby attractions, walking distance to the W25th St RTA (rapid) station. Downstairs overflow pub, too. Many excellent house brews (please don't embarrass yourself and order an MGD here). If you want to go barhopping and ride the rapid home, this is a good place to start, and Ohio City is a great neighborhood for bar crawling. The place is esp. fun when they have live music, and you'll see customers in every age range having fun. Go and have fun yourself!   PS--liked this place much better than the Bier Garten (?) nearby, but if you are at the bar there you'll have fun and enjoy the people there, too (but limited menu and unreliable service outside the barkeeps)."}
{"text":"The beer is great. The food is enjoyable. I like how they are taking ethnic food styles from around CLE and putting a gourmet twist to them, such as the butternut squash pierogis. The only problem I had with the meal is that the food was cold, which was most likely due to the high volume of customers the evening I went. I would definitely considering returning during a time period that was less likely to have as many customers just so I could enjoy my food warm. I was hoping a restaurant of this notoriety could handle getting food off the line quickly."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way home from a long trip from New Orleans to Buffalo, NY.  To eat we ordered a Cobb salad and a YUMMY margarita pizza.    To drink we had pints of their Burning River pale ale, their Nosferatu, and their organic beer called Cellar Dweller.  Honestly, everything was excellent.  The only thing I wish I did differently was order the Cellar Dweller first before my Burning River pint. While Cellar Dweller was a nice mild hoppy beer, the Burning River has so much more flavor.    Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"A solid brewery across from the market. It was packed but the service was good. The black and bleu burger was delicious"}
{"text":"If you like Great Lakes beers and excellent food, this is your place! We stop in each time we are in Cleveland specifically for the beers they only serve at the brewery. There's always a unique selection to try. We usually sit in the cellar, but the restaurant and outside patio are also nice. The local fare plate is a must try considering you are in the market district. Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Always an awesome place to go with delicious food and beverages!"}
{"text":"Two words: BREAD PUDDING   Okay...two more....Christmas Ale.    Hmmm...that just might be my last meal on earth."}
{"text":"Awesome brewery and great food. Really neat inside. Service was great and fast. Had a nice quick and delicious lunch on our way through town. Always better when it's fresh beer on tap and they source locally as much as they can for food. Probably best beer cheese soup I've had-they do it with Stilton. Pub bites are great-nice beer battered and light flakey fish. Pierogies are good as they always are in Cleveland. And solid Brussel sprout salad. Huge portions. Left happy and full/content but not heavy/crappy at all."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially in fall and winter, because they serve warm, hearty peasant food. It feeds your soul. It's pretty good too. I once ordered some sort of plate of barley and it was so good. Not boring at all, like you'd expect it to be. I don't think I ever drank alcohol here, so I cannot comment on that, but the food is great."}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday afternoon- crowded.  We just wanted a few drinks/apps but couldn't find a place in the bar to sit.  Waited about 30 minutes for a table- beer was excellent, pub fries are terrific!  Service was exceptional.   Recommend!!"}
{"text":"How do you know the beer is good? Better yet, how do you know it's strong? When the bar itself puts a limit on how many Christmas Ales it is allowed to serve you.  It really is a home. Not in that drunken Barney, The Simpson's, type of fashion. In that Norm and Clifford type of way, but to think of it - I'm not sure if that is an improvement. The staff are helpful - they're beer lovers, and they're always getting new brews and they encourage everyone to sample the beers.  - Hey try this new beer.  - Why thank you. Of course I will accept a tasting of free beer.  Most of the wait staff are friends, and afterwards, when their shift has ended - they've joined me for a couple of beers. It's never a place that you're alone - the people that work there to the patrons are always friendly. It's a great environment, and I'm getting homesick just talking about it.   The layout is pretty impressive. There's an upstairs for dining. There is also another section for dining on the main floor, plus a pub. Next door is \"The Beer Garden,\" which is an outside dining area that can be enclosed - with a fire place. Then there's a downstairs area, which is more like a English Pub. And of course, when the weather is right - the entire area in the front is converted into a dining area.  In March from the 16th to the 24th. You can find me there, and if I'm on the floor - leave a post it note on me that says hi."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  The Fresh Plate with cheeses, vegetables and homemade bread is my new favorite thing to order everywhere and this one was solid.  G had the Cuban sandwich, I had salmon pizza which was waaay salty.  Beers were good, but not mind blowing.  Had the Porter ice cream for dessert. THAT was mind blowing. Don't even know why we ordered it. we never order ice cream and it was a cold night. But so glad we did. Service was professional and not over-friendly. Just how we like it."}
{"text":"Just like the rating says: GLBC is just A-OK. It's nice in that it's a quintessential Cleveland spot with a pretty safe menu, conveniently located right off West 25th; it's the perfect place to take your out-of-town friends without overwhelming them.   While it's nothing to write home home about - service is average, food is average - there's nothing inherently wrong with it, and if you're looking for an easy, standard meal while out in Ohio City, it's definitely a good choice."}
{"text":"I ate there a few days ago. Great fish & chips. Great atmosphere and the beer is, of course, their own amazing brew. Service was exceptional, even though it was game night and the Indians were at home a few blocks away, and fans were there eating and drinking right up until game time. Wait time for a table was only about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great food, in the center of Cleveland, great service and a memorable experience.  Not to be missed."}
{"text":"This place is cool. I love the area and the ambiance. We sat downstairs which is like a dungeon. Very cool - and listened to a singer on the guitar. I had the shrimp tacos and pumpkin beer. Both delicious! I usually end up taking home some of my meal because I can't finish it, but I ate the entire thing. The portion was great as was the taste. Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Rude waitstaff ruined an otherwise decent meal.  Waiter rushed around giving the impression that he was really too busy to be bothered with our table. flatbread pizzas were delicious. My daughter's Entree salad was minuscule."}
{"text":"beer is great, food is ok, atmosphere  is good. the brewpub is downstairs and darker, but often has seating when you're standing around the crowded bar. it's interesting what they did with the side room/indoor-outdoor convertable patio, but i liked the beer-garden that was previously there--oh well. on the menu, i opt for the pierogies or burger. fave beers: christmas ale (!!), holy moses, burning river.  can go on a tour of the brewery while you're there if you so desire."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  We were in town for our friends' wedding and ventured out here the morning of.  The building itself is great and the bar are is excellent.  It was so bizarre coming from Chicago, asking for 2 beers (microwbrews at that..) and having the bartender say \"$6.00\". What a welcoming price!  Once our whole group showed up we sat down and split a full menu sampler between 2 of us. My fiancé and I got good & buzzed and sampled every beer on the menu for a mere $19.00.  My fiancé and I split the bratwurst & pierogi and the mushroom pizza. It was amazing. We were with 6 other people and every single person loved their food.   Service, beer & food were out of this world and it was a wonderful start to a great day in Cleveland."}
{"text":"GLBC makes Cleveland a better city.  You know you are in a world class place - it feels both historically significant and welcoming.   They are committed to environmental sustainability. Their beers are world class. If you make one trip to Cleveland, this is a must visit."}
{"text":"eh, sit outside in the summer with a cold dortmunder and shut up.  this beer is good. they should sell it everywhere."}
{"text":"They woould have got FIVE stars.  The food is great.  The beer is awesome.  However, they treated me like crap on the phone.  I asked to do a simple exchange for something I purchased in their giftshop, but they would not accomodate.  Thanks Mo - appreciate the help."}
{"text":"The beer: delicious.  The food: outstanding!  Some great items on the menu, including a sandwich with smoked sausage topped with pirogi, topped with sauerkraut and mustard.  So bad for you, but so good."}
{"text":"Good service, food and atmosphere. Waitress was really nice :)"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night very busy which is to be expected. Wait was only half hour for two of us. I ordered fish and chips and they didn't bring vinegar with it. I asked for some twice after they brought the food and it never ended up coming, which is really sad because I only got the fish to dump vinegar all over. They brought my salad after my meal was eaten. They put the wrong cheese on my gf cheeseburger. She said it was still good but it wasn't what she ordered. Of course the beer is great. We definitely will not be back. Not worth the hassle really."}
{"text":"Beer is great, and atmosphere is beautiful. Came for the Christmas Ale. I do not recomend eating here. The food is good but not worth the price. It is locally sourced and fresh...which is good. The portions are small and not garnished or even presented in a special way. Parking is street. Our server is nice and prompt but even the best service is not worth the price."}
{"text":"The beer sampler is great. 12 different 4 oz shots for 15 bucks. Their pretzel chicken is really good, as well as the barbeque sauce they make in-house. Goes good on anything. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I love everything about GLBC but the other night I had the fish and chips and it was absolutley awful! I felt like I was chewing rubber! Bad enough that I will never order it again. . . The nicest spot in Ohio City without a doubt but be careful with the cod. Wouldn't want it to ruin the night for you."}
{"text":"A fixture in the Ohio City neighborhood. The restaurant is pretty big with a large outdoor seating area, on peak times in summer there should be little wait for a table. I went here for lunch at 12 on a Saturday and there was no wait for a table, though the bar was full. Service was quick and the waitress was friendly  The main reason to come here is the beer. All of the all-year and seasonal beers, as well as ones that are only served at the brewpub.   The food is good, though a tad overpriced. My burger was good, maybe even very good, but at $12, even when using local ingredients as they do, I would expect amazing.   Strongly recommend taking the brewery tour. It's free, you'll learn a little about beer production, and you get 25 cent samples. The tour lasts 45 minutes to an hour, so make sure to budget time for it."}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's gems!  I try to go here each time I am through Cleveland.  On a recent visit, we had the local plate as an appetizer with cured meats, cheeses, olives, bread, etc. which was an excellent starter, especially paired with the pumpkin beer (a must try!)  The entire meal was fantastic as was the service and atmosphere.    We also took Great Lakes up on the shuttle service offer to the Cavs game with cheap tickets purchased next door and we couldn't have been more pleased!  Will return on home game days just for that.  Great addition :)"}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company is like Simon and Garfunkel. Simon is amazing, Garfunkel's nothin' special  You absolutely cannot beat the beer. The stuff is divine. You can, however, beat the food... Not that it's bad, it's just nothing special."}
{"text":"beers are good for sure and service is bar is great.  head up to their meeting and events facility though and watch out.  service there is low and lacks interest!"}
{"text":"Always busy, good food, great beer and located in one of Cleveland's best neighborhoods for bar hopping. It's definitely a must-try."}
{"text":"One of the most consistent, best places to have dinner and beer in Cleveland.   GLBC is obviously known for their well-established line of craft beer, but they also hit the mark with excellent food.   Pretzel chicken is the best dish in Cleveland. Beer is always on-point. My go-to place if I'm taking someone to dinner from out of town.   Every room gives a good vibe, but the basement/cellar is by far the coolest."}
{"text":"We ate there in June 2014. We sat outside because the weather was nice. Outside seating area is nice along the street. I read reviews that said beer was very good but food mediocre. I have to agree. We were pleased with beer but I think food was just average (I had pulled pork). Service was good and the inside of the restaurant was really neat. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because food quality is more important to me. The rest of my family would of probably gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great Lakes, Great Times , have been there at least 6 times . Food has always been up to par . Going to Great lakes on the weekend you will find some crowds .....They offer some wonderful brews make sure you try the Eliot Ness and the Edmund Fitzgerald . It is in a great Part of town with alot going on . Service can be a little snow but good things come to all who wait . They have some great fish dishes as well as standard bar food . Staff appears to be well trained if it's summer try to get a table outside . Can't wait to get back to Cleveland ....."}
{"text":"To the reviews that think GLBC doesn't have character, ask to sit in the cavern like lower level or hang out near the entrance and learn the history of the wooden bar or sit in the Earth friendly year round patio and ask why there is straw in the wall or take the free, on the hour tour of the brew pub...  As for the food, yes, it varies, but I attribute that to the ever changing selection and the use of locally and/or organically grown ingredients.  If in doubt, try the standbys - beer cheese soup, the pretzel chicken or pizzas.  If the butternut squash ravioli is available, go for it.  What ever you do, leave room for dessert.  The bread pudding is almost as famous as the beer!  The beers are, in general, amazing.  Everyone has different tastes though - go for the sampler.  The Black Out Stout and the Edmund Fitzgerald are my favs.  Plan ahead - the wait time can be close to two hours on the weekends."}
{"text":"Usually, breweries have good pub food menus and you're really just there to drink the beer. I was really impressed with the GLBC menu, which offered a local twist on time-honored European classics that compliment the here selections well.   There are different rooms in the dining area, and we had front-row seats to the kettles during a weekday lunch.  If the weather's cooperative, outside would be a good option.  The waitstaff were very attentive, and knowledgeable about the food and beers.  If you're a fan of Nosferatu (either the beer or the film) they've got some pretty fierce hoodies in the well-stocked gift shop! Overall, I'd look forward to returning next time I'm in Cleveland, for both the beer and the food."}
{"text":"Great food and the speakeasy downstairs is usually the varsity move, but it's still way, way small relative to the traffic it generates. I find myself headed to Market Garden Brewery for almost as delicious beer and better food that I can actually enjoy instead of dealing with the hour and a half wait here."}
{"text":"Stopped here while driving through Cleveland on a road trip a few weeks ago.  The whole operation is impressive - an elegant upstairs bar, dining rooms indoors that had the brew tanks encased in glass, outdoor patios decorated with kegs and flowers, a gift shop, and a basement area reminiscent of European cellar pubs.  We were seated in the dining room near the brew tanks and were presented with a delicious menu with a full selection of beer from light lagers to dark stouts including an organic German ale. We were especially interested in the Cellar Dweller Organic Ale because of our interest in maintaining the viability of agriculture into the future (and to avoid supporting use of petrochemicals because of carbon footprint and effects on our health). They ran out of Cellar Dwellar so we tried the Commodore Perry IPA and the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Both were well crafted, satisfying, flavorful beers.  The best part about this restaurant is their commitment to sustainability. We were impressed wiht the variety of regional and locally sourced ingredients and sustainable seafood selections on the menu. This is the kind of business that I seek out and want to support, as where the food comes from is equally important to me as the taste. The food did taste pretty good by the way. We started out with the mussels steamed in Great Lakes' own Dortmunder Gold Lager, garlic with butter, bell peppers and lemon. It was served with fresh hearty warm whole wheat bread for dipping in the broth. Next we ate the chopped Greek salad that was standard, but refreshing and hit the spot. We also tried the Lake Erie Perch with sauteed pea pods in lemon basil sauce. It had a light, tender buttery texture with more flavor than a typical white fish.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I am definitely going to make time to stop in for another scrumptious meal at Great Lakes Brewing Company! See my accompanying pictures on the fresh dish dot com."}
{"text":"I was less than impressed. With all of the hype about this place, I was expecting something phenomenal, and what we got was only mediocre. The ambiance of the basement where all of the beer taps are, was pretty cool, but the restaurant itself wasn't very impressive."}
{"text":"Love the pub selects and the atmosphere in the basement bar. Food pretty good but there are better choices round the corner. We go here for the beer and tours with friends visiting from out of town. This is one of the original breweries and businesses in the revitalized area. The area is one of our favorites in Cleveland for beer and food. A good mix of 25-45 year olds makes this a good place for day drinking, evening fun or a stop on a brewery hop."}
{"text":"I'm rating all of my experiences on the food and not the beer. If you like micro-brews, please visit, take a tour or buy something from the gift shop.   The food is awful.  In the several times that I ate here, the food tasted as if it was poured from a can.  The service is just ok; fair at best.  The atmosphere is fantastic but so are the other Market Place restaurants who have absolutely amazing food.  Attn. owners:  fire the manager, cooks and staff and make this a destination to remember."}
{"text":"My new favorite craft brewery. We went recently and they hands down had the most selection of beers that I liked. I've been to a lot of different breweries and they all have one or two beers I like, but great lakes had more than a half dozen I dream about. I wish I could get your beers in Iowa!!"}
{"text":"the original in ohio city. i remember  when they opened in the late 80's.  had the best lamb stew.  those days are gone ,however the beer remains ."}
{"text":"Really like the beer and food. Everything I've tried there has been very good. Really like the location too - and the patio and biergarden make for an awesome al fresco dining experience! Great place!"}
{"text":"Cleveland's local brewery.  Great place to get food and a beer.  Nice menu of hearty midwestern dishes.  And of course, lots of excellent beer on tap."}
{"text":"I was with a crowd that only enjoys crappy beers, but I forced them to go into Great Lakes to try some real beer.  Well, they didn't enjoy them because they actually had taste, but I certainly did. Unfortunately, I only got to try an Oktoberfest before I was forced to leave.  The place itself is pretty cool. I went down to the pub area in the basement. Much cooler, temperature-wise, than upstairs. It was a scorcher so it was nice to cool down and enjoy a nice beer.  Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'm definitely going to go back and sample a few more beers. They do sell Great Lakes here in Syracuse, NY, but there's something about getting it from the source that makes it just a little bit better."}
{"text":"Came in here for an early afternoon Friday Bar Crawl. We crawled down to the basement for some beers and they were decently good as expected from Great Lakes. The ambiance in the basement is pretty cool and feels like an old tavern. It'd be worthwhile to make a reservation for their free brewery tours given on site everyday starting at 5pm I think.  Heard the food is good, so next time I'll try not to drink so much and have some food instead! maybe."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited the GLBC with a friend two days ago.  The service, as always, was great, and so was the food. My pretzel appetizer was delicious. My husband had the pub bites and almost ordered another one, that's how much he liked it.  I am not a beer drinker, but my husband loves the Lorelei Dunkel Weizen !  Hoping to go back soon, because we love this place!"}
{"text":"Great beer, and that might be an understatement. They are constantly coming up with new brews and I am rarely disappointed. If you like IPAs, I suggest the Lake Erie Monster. Nosferatu is a tasty red ale. And who could forget the Christmas Ale.   Great atmosphere with many options, including the basement pub, main level bar, front patio, or covered patio.  The food gets 3-4 stars, but it is getting better. The cheese soup is great.   They are also environmentally friendly, be it their shuttles that run on recycled cooking oil, using locally grown food, or their commitment to conservation.   All in all, great spot in a great neighborhood, and not to be missed if you enjoy beer."}
{"text":"Had the black and blue burger. Great . wife had Cleaveland here also great. Add on some great craft beer and you get 5 stars. Oh service was great"}
{"text":"I went here with a group brewery tour a little time ago. First and foremost, if you can go on the tour I highly suggest it. So much history in the buildings. And fascinating to see and learn how the beer is made.   Following the tour we ate dinner and \"sampled\" the beers. The food here is just incredible. With the tour we tried multiple appetizers. The pretzels are to die for and there was another appetizer I wanted to eat all of myself; however, I cannot remember what it was. They were almost like a hush puppy with a spicy remoulade. Amazing. For dinner I had the Pretzel Chicken. Oh-my-Lord. Chicken dishes are always my go to. This is easily one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had.   The building itself is beautiful. The one room has a wood burning fireplace. It fills the room with that comforting warmth and smell (but doesnt leave you smelling like a campfire). The downstairs bar is unlike any I've seen. You must check that out."}
{"text":"I need to put this disclaimer out first. I love Edmund Fitzgerald. If it's below 60 outside there are few things I would rather drink and since Great Lakes distribution is shit that's what I drink when I can get it. There food was what was unexpected. High quality food for a decent price. Shared a charcuterie board and had pierogies and sausage. Both really good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here twice for leisure weekday lunches. The service, food, ambiance, and BEER are always great. Looking forward to a tour when family comes to visit!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. We had a company dinner there and they handled our rowdy table with grace and ease. We ended up closing down the bar that night but felt welcomed all the way to last call. The seating availability was great and didn't feel too crowded. Looking forward to our next dinner."}
{"text":"We have done both the tour/tasting and had dinner there a few times. The food is always good and the atmosphere is very cool, although it gets loud since it is a brewery."}
{"text":"Had not been here in years, so I thought I would try it again.  Went on a Friday evening (last night), and naturally it was pretty busy.  Hostess said it would be a 15-25 minute wait, and it was only 10 minutes.  The beer here is really great -- if you like any kind of beer at all, they will have something fresh that you will enjoy. The other more dependable positives here are the space and decor. Fun vibe and interesting things on the walls.  So really, if you like beer and want a fun place just to hang, it's a fine place.   Now, on the not-so-great side of the ledger, my wife & I took my parents, who each have compromised hearing, here for dinner. And I have some hearing loss myself.  Due to the hardwood floors and walls with no acoustical treatments, the place is downright LOUD, and we had to nearly scream at each other to converse. (But hey, we are half deaf.) Prices were okay, but overpriced for the quality. We all ordered pretty simple dishes, and they were average, at best. 5 entrees (one was take-out), 3 beers and 1 coffee totaled $105 with tip.  Service was good, especially considering how busy they were.  Would I go back?  Sure, for a beer and appetizers. I don't see eating dinner here again, though."}
{"text":"Beers are great! I preferred the IPAs and Porter, but would recommend the flight as they have some unique offerings! Food is ok, but that's not what I came for anyway."}
{"text":"It is a shame that a place with such great beer has awful food. I have never meet a person that likes the pub food they serve."}
{"text":"I met a customer here for a business lunch. Because we are old friends, we enjoyed a couple of tap microbrews and were not disappointed. The names are creative and somewhat self deprecating (Burning River Ale!), and the beer was delicious. Food was good -- standard pub fare. Enjoyed the \"working brewery\" atmosphere and the location near the West Side Market. Service was quick and friendly. Glad I went. Will return to attempt to try more of the beer offerings."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a year or so when my friends when we need a different location to chill at in Cleveland. My friends love the beer..I love the appetizers (PUB fries are fantastic, good pizzas too) and the atmosphere. I've never eaten upstairs for a meal, but the pub is fun. We went on a beer tour here as well.. It was very educational with good samples and nice presenter. I enjoyed (and, I don't even love beer). It's nice to know we have a local brewery with a good reputation. Downside: not much room in the pub during busy times (it's small!) and it closes early for the weekend hours."}
{"text":"The \"fresh and local\" was the best appetizer I have had in ages! Great beer and great company after a wonderful day of hiking at the national park..."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here.  The food was really good. It was a Saturday night so we had to wait more than an hour. We went to a bar and waited while for them to call us which was convenient.  The service was great as was the decorum.  This place is solid."}
{"text":"Great beer, loved the fact all the food was from the local area and sooo delicious"}
{"text":"I have been here several time and was distressed to hear that the quality of food had gone down. So I was pleasently surprised this weekend how good everything was. The beer is always the draw, but the food was amazing too. I always order the preztle chicken and almost changed my order because of resent reviews; I am so glad I went with my gut!! It was wonderful, along with the beer/cheese soup and the soft preztle app, everything was great! I really hope that this was not a fluck night and the food is not what is used to be, but this night it was great!"}
{"text":"First off great beer and amazing Christmas ale! But they are called a brewery for a reason....so don't expect much out of there food. I ordered the old world burger and after the second time they brought it back it still taste awful! I also forgot to mention all this happened after a 2 1/2 hour wait when they said 90 minutes and us repeatedly going back. Although the manager and the servers were great to deal with it was so so. I guess I'll just stick to getting the beer at a local grocery store!!"}
{"text":"Probably a pretty good place, but the miserable bartender turned us off. Had one round and left. He seemed irritated that we asked for some details on a couple of beers. A place like that should have a bartender thats passionate about their beer list."}
{"text":"I was told that on my trip to CLE I had to make a trip to the GLBC for a bite to eat and to try some of their home brewed beers. Needless to say I accomplished both feats on my last visit.  The beer is good and the service is quick (although we arrived during the dinner rush) the hostesses take your phone number and will call you once your table is ready, the only problem was that they took the number down wrong and when they called we didn't know that our table was ready. Luckily enough, once we got upstairs to ask about it, they still had a table available.  The server was nice and attentive, the food was good, I got the Buffalo chicken pizza, nothing else on the menu really caught my eye, I wasn't much for the burgers or the chicken.   I would definitely recommend it for someone in the area"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress was nice but was under staffed for a Friday night. Beer was excellent! But took way to long to get another round. Food was ehhh average i had the pulled pork sandwich and it was very dry. The only reason its a 3 star was because the tots and the beer were great.. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I visited Great Lakes last night for the first time.  I assumed we would have to wait at 8pm on a Friday, and it was busy but we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us right away and three of us had the Belgian Tripel Dog Dare which was very good.  I ordered the Pretzel Chicken which comes in two sizes, one breast for 11 and two for 14.  I went with one because I have a small stomach but regretted it because it was so good.  The breading made an ordinary chicken dish something different.  The cheesy mashed potatoes were good, but the broccoli needed another minute or two of steaming.  My friends also enjoyed their meals (Blue Cheese Burger, Mac and Cheese, and Pierogies/Sausages).  Despite the undercooked broccoli, I'm giving Great Lakes 5 stars because of the great service, delicious food, and good beers."}
{"text":"It is ALWAYS packed!  We had a friend in town visiting so we took him to \"taste\" a few beers.  90 minute wait for a table for three.  So, we headed downstairs to the cave...and somehow scored two seats at the bar.  So the guys stood around one and I sat.  Thank goodness!  We consumed...Elliot Ness, Blackout Stout (yum!), and Christmas ale.  We also nibbled on a mushroom pizza (yum!), BBQ chicken pizza (okay), and a pretzel (okay).  When we ordered the pretzel the bartender let us know that they only had pieces of pretzel not actual pretzels...I should have said no thanks - knowing that it was probably leftover dough.  Oh well. I had a great pretzel somewhere else recently and I wanted to compare.   It's a great spot to bring out-of-towners for a beer.  Not a fabulous spot for food and not a great spot if you're in a hurry.   By the way if you haven't seen, they basically own the block now."}
{"text":"Went here while in Cleveland just because I love their beers. Have to say the food we had was awesome. Started off with a cheese plate with cheeses, veggies and meats from all local growers.  Without getting into to many details the entrees were delicious and the service was impeccable with the waitress giving us many ideas of what to do in Cleveland (and not the touristy stuff)  Great place to hang out and eat and drink."}
{"text":"Beer is always exceptional here. The \"pub exclusive\" beers were fantastic. I grew up in Cleveland (live in Denver now) and love visiting the brewery.  Usually the food is great too, but not  today. Someone else mentioned the pretzel chicken. I did that. It was below average -- overcooked, not seasoned and generally just kinda terrible. A relative had the \"special,\" a walleye (I guess?), which was even worse. Another relative had the pizza. That was solid.  It pains me to write a mediocre review because I love this place, but a storied brewery like this should have storied food too -- not hit or miss."}
{"text":"The food here is NOT good.  It is overpriced and not fresh.  Maybe I am spoiled because of all the other places in OC that are great, but unless you are getting just beer from the less than enthusiastic wait staff, I'd say just buy a six at the store and skip this place all together."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food and an excellent atmosphere. What a craft brewery restaurant should be."}
{"text":"A Cleveland must do!  The beer here is incredible!  Try the stout or the dortmunder .....  The food is a bit of a bummer, but really, is that why you came ?    Happy hour tip - each week the feature a different $2 draft."}
{"text":"Cheers to our bartender at lunchtime on 9/1 in the cellar. She was pleasant, knowledgeable, attentive and seemed to enjoy her work. Even when they got packed, we still felt tended to. We had the flight of all their current beers (12). We were impressed with the variety of flavors!  The food took a while, but we were happy to people watch and relax. Best fries we've had in a long time. May have a hint of rosemary in seasoning. We would return without hesitation. Loved the old building, decor, and atmosphere. These people know what they are doing."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 12 on Friday January 5th @ 8:00p.m for the tour of the Brewery. And when I say that our host was AMAZING!!!! It would be an understatement. We learned a lot but Boy did we laugh ALOT. Her sense of humour was AWESOME all while being informative. My group hasn't stopped talking about how different this experience was and how much they enjoyed this Adult outing :). And let's not forget the beer was awesome too.I've been a Great Lakes fan for years and this put the stamp on why. We will definitely be back. S/N also Gabe was awesome to work with after I made a hiccup with online reservations he was very accommodating and helped me correct the error so our group could enjoy this outing together.."}
{"text":"Absolutely, 100% lived up to expectations. This place is awesome. Visiting around noon on a Saturday with a party of 3, we were able to sit at the bar while we waited for our table. The restaurant itself is made up of several different dining rooms, and the lower level is particularly cool with its brick archways and another very old-looking bar.  Worth mentioning is their canning machine, which is located right at the bar and can be used to instantly make a 32 oz. take-home can of any of the beers on tap! This is an awesome feature for people who don't want buy a growler, and I hope more places that currently offer growlers start offering this service.  The beer: exceptional. Of course.  The food: We had the pretzels w/ cheese soup (not labeled as beer cheese, so I don't know if there's beer in it but it was tasty), as well as the sausage platter to start with. I really liked the different types mustard they provided with their 4 varieties of sausage.  Both my companions ordered the Mac & Cheese, and despite how amazing it tasted they were unable to finish their large portions. I ordered the Inside-Out Pot Pie, which was essentially a beef stew-concoction served over puff pastry. I would order it again in a heartbeat, except that there were so many enticing entrees on the menu (hello, meatloaf sandwich) that I would probably try something different next time. We also split a basket of fries between us, and I'm not really ashamed to say this might have been my favorite part of the whole meal! Seriously, those fries were stellar."}
{"text":"The Great Lakes Brewery Brewpub. It's like trying to review Jerusalem or Mecca...but better.  Great Lakes has to have one of my favorite brewpubs in the country -- not just because their beer is worth writing home about everyday and twice on Sunday, but because one can feel the nostalgic and yet somehow timeless atmosphere of the building(s) almost immediately.  Situated right in Ohio City across from the West Side Market, the GLBC Brewpub is easily accessible from the downtown area -- and definitely worth the journey from the 'burbs. It's not a terribly large place -- so if it's busy, simply remember that good things come to those who wait.  I must say, I didn't expect to find one of the best burgers I've had in months...but I did...and it was amazing! My friend very much enjoyed her chicken sandwich as well. Our service was pretty good -- she was busy, but her knowledge of the beer more than compensated.  One thing I simply must note: I took one look at the beer menu and thought: \"I really want to try this 'Cleveland Brown Ale'\" -- only to be greeted by our server who said: \"Really sorry, we're out of the Cleveland Brown Ale -- and oh-by-the-way we don't bottle it and don't sell it anywhere else\". This was ~2 months ago and as I was only just visiting C-town, my pitty party is just now ending.  Bottom line -- unless you hate good food, despise great beer, and have no desire for a fun dining experience, there's no reason not to stop in and enjoy the Great Lakes Brewpub."}
{"text":"30 minute wait on a Wednesday night?? I walked to the Market Brewery down the street and had a great \"no-wait\" dinner instead.   The hostess called me from here and let me know my table was ready when I was already 4 beers in and dinner served somewhere else.   I am posting 2 stars for the long wait and careless attitude of the hostess, in all fairness I did not have any food or drink."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Pre-formed  looking frozen burgers that were undercooked. Used to have good food. Not so much now. In a popular area so plenty of people go. Was told 30-50 minute wait for table. Was less than 10 minutes. Not good service or food.   Recommend pass."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go for brunch on Saturday. If you have guests coming into town, you have to take them to the Brewery Tour at Great Lakes. Its very informative...maybe even a little more than what you wanted to know but I think any brew enthusiast would appreciate it. The best part is that you get to sample a wide collection of their beers.  If you are into sustainability and eating local, this is place for you. Great Lakes does a great job of reusing their by-products such as barley and hops to make bread products for the restaurant and recycling their beer to make dressings other dishes to serve on a regular basis. I think it's a very smart and forward-thinking move on their part and it's something that our whole community should get behind and support."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. If you live in Cleveland, like good beer and good food, then this is a place you have to check out. There isn't a beer on the menu that isn't great and the food is excellent. If you're looking for something quick to eat while enjoying a few beers I would recommend the local appetizer platter. If you're in the mood for something sweet then give their bread pudding a try.  GLBC is one of my favorite places to go to before heading over to an Indians game or any other event going on downtown. They also have a cheap shuttle system that runs over to the baseball stadium. Be sure to check out the gift shop as well as they typically have a good selection of beers there - sometimes you'll find beers that you can't find at your local grocery store."}
{"text":"Relatives took us to GLB while we're in town visiting.  We hadn't seen each other for awhile so had a lot of catching up to do.  Server was great as he didn't rush us at all.   Food was good as was the beer.  Only negative, we asked for a couple of samples to make sure we got a beer we liked & they charged for the samples, never have been charged for a sample in our travels & we travel a lot.  Granted it was only $.25 each, but it was still a surprise."}
{"text":"I stopped in GLBC for the first time last week by default trying to find a place near the market to have lunch. I chose GLBC, so I could have a hot lunch and dine indoors since it was chilly that day.   My friend and I sat at a booth near the kitchen, which wafted rank smells of old seafood to our table. Which turned me off from the start. I ordered the ravioli, which would have been extremely bland if it wasn't bitter from the swiss chard. It was under-seasoned, had a boring sauce, and not enough walnuts (it would have been better if they used candied walnuts and more of them). It was completely unbalanced on the palate and probably the worst dish I've had dining out in a long time.   The service was okay, nothing special. I didn't have a beer, because I had to be at work in an hour. However, I've tried most of the GLBC beers already being from Cleveland.   My advice, go for the beer, and grab food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Long time Great Lakes drinker, first time visit to the Cleveland brew pub. First off - the service here was great.  The server was the right amount of stay away - get me what I want/need.  I love it.  Not pushy but on top of it.  Second - the food here was top notch!  We elected to try the special pizza (jerk rubbed pork) and the sausage pierogi platter.  Both were really good.  I would recommend both but for sure come for the pierogis!  Third - the beer here is just another level.  There is a reason that Great Lakes has been around since 1988, they know what they are brewing!  Tried some brew pub select drafts and all were solid.  If you are in Cleveland you should come here. You don't even need to be into beer to have a great experience!  The food is that good too!"}
{"text":"GLBC is one of the precious few joys of living in Cleveland... especially during the winter! Nothing is better at helping you forget the grey and gloom of NE Ohio than a fresh Christmas ale or two. Later in the year, the Lake Erie Monster and Barrel-aged Blackout Stout are also delicious options, the latter which you can only purchase on-site. The tour at the brewery across the street is a fun way to further connect with a great local business. I can't much speak for the food, but there are some amazing brews to be had."}
{"text":"Very good brews!  Fish special great, sirloin steak very poor quality. I loved our waitress Mary! Will come back for the beer, forget the food"}
{"text":"first...I checked in via Yelp online.  they told me their wait list doesn't sync up with yelp so we had to wait an extra 30 min. Second, it took 50 min to get our food AFTER we placed our order.  Not looking good so far  edit, food just got here and my burger is cold."}
{"text":"I love their beer and the atmosphere is excellent. Food has been pretty hit and miss over the years, not that anything has ever been terrible its just not... extraordinary as I think it could be. Maybe its time for a menu revamp? They have over cooked my burger a few times but I love their local and fresh plate. In summary, I go here for drinks, not food."}
{"text":"This place is good, the food is good, the beer is great, but it is no different than any other cities brewery.  The make their own beer and sell it.  If you like breweries and enjoy visiting them when you are in new towns you should check it out."}
{"text":"We went here after visiting the Westside Market and had a wonderful lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Sat outside, there was music and street vendors.  Food was good but not great.  I had a roasted beet salad (I think they were canned, just a bit disappointed, but tasty), Mom had a Rueben, hubby had pretzel chicken.  All was good, beer was great. Plenty of choices for both. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Would eat there again.  But really if I could give 3.5 instead of 4, I would."}
{"text":"First time to the GLBC....went on the tour. Our tour guide SARAH was the best. She was informative, knew what she was talking about. SARAH made us laugh, felt like on tour with a good friend. We will be back with more family."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. The staff were friendly and the service excellent. They have homemade tater tots! The bomb!"}
{"text":"Thank you Great Lakes for finally getting the TRUE Cleveland Ballpark mustard. Although, your Burgers don't need a thing on them! Once again, satisfaction guaranteed. :) this time tho I had a Nasferatu beer, really good. Can't wait until my favorite Christmas Ale comes out next week, guaranteeing another visit! Many great memories here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My Cuban sandwich and fries were fantastic!  Edmund Fitzgerald on nitro was a nice twist. Five stars if they had a little more robust tap room exclusive draft list."}
{"text":"Very cool place .. I like the beer and the food is outstanding .. One thing they need to do is put some updated TV's in the cellar !! Really.. It's hard to watch a good sporting event with old outdated small blurry TV's while drinking a beer!Just saying ..spend a few bucks TV's are cheap these days!!"}
{"text":"Food & Drinks = 5 star Service = 3 star  Hamburger was delicious and the fries were even better.  Wife had the fish and chips with mashed potatoes.  Loved the fish, potatoes were ok.  Pretzels were good but must have been sitting in the window for a bit because we're barely warm - the lemonade and blueberry drink with vodka is out of this world - smash up the lemon that comes with it and makes it even better!"}
{"text":"The official brewery of Cleveland.  They always have the pulse of the City of Cleveland.  From the Blackout Stout to Quitness, Great Lakes has a brew for anyone's palate.    When I was here I had the pizza special.  It was delicious and filling, and I washed it down with a Comodore Perry India Pale Ale.    I suggest you stop by anytime you are in the Westside Market area.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Christmas Ale,  pretzel chicken, perogies...  Oh my!  First time there,  went for the boyfriend's bday and had a great time.  The flourless chocolate tort was amazing as well.   It was a busy Saturday night  so the service was a tiny bit slow but our server was a lovely lady who even sang happy birthday to the bf."}
{"text":"Very great food, hot delicious lunch, great location off W.25th Street...Seasonal beers gives you a variety whatever time of year you go here. They have different kinds of wine, too. Scott was our waiter, great job he did!  Prices are reasonable, too. Highly recommend a stop at Great Lakes Brewery!! Love It!! *****5 Stars"}
{"text":"their christmas ale?  holy crap on toast.  one glass and i'm singing donna summer.  two and you turn into donna summer.  three and the world is disco land, full of unicorns, care bears, and rainbows.  ...and my company party is at glbc this year.  you do the math. and see if i have a job on monday."}
{"text":"Went on the free brewery tour, which was informative and just the right length of time. You get one small beer sample of your choosing, which is nice. We also decided to eat lunch at the brewery which was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. We split the bratwurst and pierogies along with the charcuterie plate. The bratwurst was delicious as well as the pierogies. The charcuterie had a wide assortment of meats and cheese with a beautifully toasted baguette to accompany it. Paired with a Great Lakes brew, this lunch was perfection. Next time I will be sure to try to home-made pretzels!"}
{"text":"I just ate here last night and I already can't wait to go back. We were seated quickly and got our drinks fairly quickly as well. I had the Blue Lemon and it was very good and most importantly, it was strong. The vegan burger was seriously the best veggie burger I've had anywhere. Our server was friendly and efficient. I can't wait for summer so I can sit on their amazing patio. Very cool place."}
{"text":"Great Lakes was my first. And you always remember your first. I confess that I was a goody-two-shoes in college and I never had alcohol until I officially turned 21. Burning River Pale Ale paired with slices of (the now defunct) Clever Crow Pizza. Smooth, gentle, crisp. I'd somehow managed to skip keggers for a fast track into craft brews.   Anyway, fast forward to the time I finally made it to their HQ-- magical! Unfortunately we missed the tour but, we still had a great time wandering around the gift shop (get yo swag on!) and stopping in for bites 'n brews! The two of us shared a few 4-ouncers which came with a clipboard \"placemat\" letting us know which one we were trying. We also shared their short rib pierogi. Delicious and paired well with our drinks.    Until next time Great Lakes. We had some fond times together. Please remember to drink responsibly."}
{"text":"Really nice, versatile vibe going on here - inside looked cozy for cold weather and the outside seating was great for warm weather lounging. Seems like this brewery has lots of IPA's."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  YOu like good beer?  There ya go.  Good beer, good service in a nice environment.  I am obsessed with the pizza.  The pretzels could use a little help."}
{"text":"Very cool brewery that has incorporated a lot of the original bar and architecture into what is Great Lakes brewery today.  Check out the bullet holes and slugs in the wall from the assassination attempt on Eliot Ness (see my photo).  The food is good, they have a nice selection.  I had the Cuban sandwich and it was good!  For beer connoisseurs there are usually a few Exclusive beers on tap so you can select from something unique over there typical flagship beers."}
{"text":"I think I avoided writing this review back when I actually visited because I was pregnant at the time and super pissed about not being able to drink. Because the food is sorta eh, the two things that GLBC have going for it (well three) are: atmosphere, beer, and location.  I was impressed by the upstairs, but we opted for the basement, which was really cool even though it was sorta dank and cavern-y. Well, I guess that's part of the appeal. There weren't many comfortable places to sit, but I was with good friends, and that's all that matters.  As others said, this is a good spot to take out-of-towners or to just hang out in a low-key atmosphere. When you're just interested in drinks and drunken bar eats, this is a great option and one that Ohio City should be proud to house in its neighborhood."}
{"text":"Made a stop here for some beers and a light lunch.  Enjoyed sitting out on the patio since it was a beautiful day.  Picking a beer was a tough decision, so it was nice that they offered 4 oz. samples for $1.50.  Enjoyed their seasonal and pub exclusive varieties.  We've always been big fans of Great Lakes beers and always pick some up when we're in town, since they don't distribute to missouri.   As for food, everything we had was delicious!  Surprisingly, the best item was the kids cheese sauce pasta, which had to be some of the best Mac and cheese we've ever had.  The Great Lakes house salad was very tasty as well.  My husband really enjoyed the fish and chips.  The beer cheese soup is always a hit as well, especially with the pub pretzels!    Service was great and drinks and food came out fast.  Definitely check out if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Pretzel chicken is the way to go. Also, get a beer sampler and the market board app. Enjoy the the best beer in Cleveland. Have fun sit outside soak in ctown."}
{"text":"A bad steak and food poisoning to go.  If I was writhing about their beer this review would be five stars, unfortunately their food doesn't measure up.   We love GLBC's bar and beer and stop there often. I've never been crazy about their food but it seems to have been getting better over the past year.  Of course we usually stick to the appetizers or beer type dishes like sausages.   Last Saturday we planned to be in Ohio City so we decided to give their dinner another try. After all there's nothing like a Christmas Ale on draft. It's their best brew and it gets better each year.  We were in for a big disappointment.   Our excellent server convinced me to try their special, a rib eye rubbed with chilpotle seasoning. It sounded great so I ordered it medium rare (as recommended).  My wife ordered the Lake Erie perch, one of her favorites.  At the last minute I also ordered the New England clam  chowder.  It  arrived quickly and was as good as advertised.    When my steak was served it looked excellent.  However it turned out to be one of the worst steaks I've had in a restaurant. It had little flavor, was very chewy and full of gristle.  The only flavor was the rub, which was good. For $22 I expect much better than I can make at home.    I told our server and to their credit, the manager stopped by the table. He offered to replace it, but we didn't have time to wait.  Instead he offered to buy us dessert.   My wife's perch was another surprise. One of the pluses of living on Lake Erie is this small fish with a distinctive sweet flavor.  We order it a frequently.   Her dish didn't taste like the real thing. In fact I'd guess that they actually served her walleye cut into small pieces. Of course I can't prove it, but if someone from GLBC'S is reading this...we're on to you.   Something else I can't prove is the source of the nasty case of food poisoning I had about 2 hours after leaving the restaurant. The most likely culprit was the clam chowder.   Be careful of this one.   We should send chef Robert Irvine into the kitchen to check sanitation and temperature control.    Bottom line, stop by for the beer, it's the best micro brew In the East. If you want to eat, stick to the bar food. Looking for a good steak?  Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love reviews like this because I total loved this place. A very cozy and warm feeling came over me when I entered here. Their beer is top notch and can go toe to toe with any craft brewery in Texas. I had a flight of their brews and the one that stood out was the Lake Erie Monster. Its a darker beer with a lot of flavor. The staff was attentive and had good recommendations on what to try. If you find yourself in Cleveland make sure you swing by and sample their beer."}
{"text":"Beer - yes Food - meh  Big hits and misses but you dont need to go here for the food. Stick with the seasonal treats and beers you can only get at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing, they have a solid line-up of beers available year around ranging from a light crisp lager (Dortmunder Gold®) to a dark robust porter (Edmund Fitzgerald®) with several variations in between (Let's not forget the Commodore Perry® for those of us who enjoy a good IPA. Not to mention a couple others that range more towards a 9% ABV) guaranteed to satisfy any craft beer lover or anyone new to the game. In addition, they have a new seasonal  out every couple months if not every month.   To include traditional favorites like   Oktoberfest, and of course the notorious Christmas Ale they also have additions like Nosferatu®, Rally Drum Red Ale® and many others. Keep in mind some of the seasonals are available bottled at their respective time and others only on draft, if you have a growler, you're able to take some home.   The first time I went there with my family we got the sampler which included their staple beers and the seasonals during the month of July, they always give a beer menu complete with ABV and IBU ratings for each beer sample. It is truly a well balanced sampler that both a hop enthusiast and malt lover would be satisfied with. I would suggest this to anyone wanting to get familiar with the extraordinary/award-winning family of beers they serve there.  I ordered the Old World Burger, which comes served on a pretzel bun and barbecue sauce made from the porter along with the expected fixings and beer battered/gourmet salted french fries   Needless to say I will be back again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night, wait wasn't too bad and staff was nice, not impressed with food though. Was expecting much better and even ordered one of their signature dishes. Had the world burger with kale/bacon side dish. Burger wasn't anything special and side dishes was drowning in bacon grease. Also had the tater kegs for an appetizer, which sounded amazing... had very little flavor and just weren't anything special either. My friend ordered the ramen dish which looked very appealing, but didn't have a great flavor to it..  My beer was great though! Maybe I should have just ordered a couple more of those to help make my food taste better ?     Probably will not be returning"}
{"text":"Oh Christmas Ale, oh Christmas Ale, how lovely do you taste... And how I wish I could get it in LA. Yes, for all LA's cool places to eat, you in Cleveland have Great Lakes Brewing Co. and we do not. Some Christmas Ale and the Stilton Cheese Soup are the best warm ups ever on a cold winter day and luckily, I was able to partake on a recent visit \"home\"."}
{"text":"This is a brewery.  People go to breweries to have good beer.  And good beer is what Great Lakes Brewing Company has.  Not only good beer, but fantastic beer.  Most everything they craft is terrific.  Now, if you just want to enjoy good Great Lakes beer, pick up a sampler case at a Cleveland grocery store.  If you want to experience the birth place of the beer and have the opportunity to sample some limited brews that they don't bottle, then head to the restaurant.  The food here is decent, but again, not the main attraction.  If great food and a great beer is what you want, go to another restaurant and order a Great Lakes Beer.  If you want to experience the brewery and sample some flavors not available at the grocery store, go to the brewery."}
{"text":"The brewery tour is the star of the show here, Make sure to reserve a spot online in advance if you plan on going on a weekend though. The beers are all good, more \"staple\" beers than the other local breweries that get more experimental though. The food at the brewpub is just okay, the sausage and mustard appetizer is great but the rest of the food I've had wasn't memorable.   If you get a chance, try one of the limited-release barrel aged beers!"}
{"text":"Great Brewpub Experience!  I have been a fan of Great Lakes Brewing Company for years. Fortunately, their beer is widely available in Central Ohio. Only recently did I have the opportunity to visit the Brewpub on Market Avenue. The historic nature of the building and the friendly waitstaff combine to create an exceptional atmosphere.   I followed the menu combination recommendation and ordered Conway's Irish Ale and the corned beef sandwich. Delicious!  My wife sampled the Dortmunder Gold and the Old World Burger. True to the Brewpub's claim, the food is fresh and tasty, and I knew the beer would be perfect. We'll be back on our next trip to Cleveland.  Michael Armstrong Bexley, Ohio"}
{"text":"The tour was fun and very informative. The Tour guide new a lot about the history of the historic buildings. The brewpub has great food and the beer is fantastic! I would recommend Great Lakes Brewery to anyone."}
{"text":"After checking out Bottlehouse we went to the hotel, and took a shuttle to the bar area. Within one block we had Great Lakes, Nano Brewing AND Market Garden Brewery. First stop...the massive Great Lakes. -It was about 6ish on a gorgeous day so of course Great Lakes was packed. But the place is so big seating isn't an issue..well unless you want dinner. But we just went to drink. I've tried almost all their beers so I figured I'd get a sampler for fun.  Well the bar was PACKED, but I was taken care of quickly and even though she was getting pulled 10 directions the bartender was awesome. Most breweries don't do samplers when it's THAT busy, but hey 11 beers for like 16$ was a steal. I had to be careful carrying them outside...almost got knocked over twice, and also was asked by two different people what it is I had..they both ran to the bar to get themselves a sampler.  -I could rate the beer, but I will just say I think anything Great Lakes makes is good. A few stand out, but I enjoy all their beers. Rye of the Tiger IPA is okay, Commodore Perry is yummy, Edmund Fitzgerald is very good, Eliot Ness is very good, Burning River is good, Dortmunder Gold is okay..but I'm not into very light beers, Conway's Irish Ale was a hit with the lady, and the others which were just special brews were all good but nothing outstanding (Butcher's Brew, Rally Red Drum Ale, Red Right 88). -We sat outside drinking for nearly an hour and really enjoyed the scenery. After our drinks we checked out the gift shop which is next to the brewery, and they have just about anything you can imagine. We bought a glass, stickers, coasters, tin sign and a bunch of posters that were on sale for like 3$. -If you're in Cleveland you HAVE to go to Great Lakes. Awesome atmosphere, nice people and a lot of fun but I do suggest you go earlier than later. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Of course the beer is excellent ( try the Eliot Ness ), but they also have good food.  This place is definitely friends and sweetie-worthy and it MIGHT be first date-worthy."}
{"text":"The Eliot Ness and Commodore Perry IPA a must try and goes well with the grill chicken sandwich!  They need a fish sandwich thou!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch! No wait to sit on a Thursday at 1:00. Attentive fast service. Recommended! The beer here speaks for itself, very good and many IPA options. Prices for lunch around 10$ very nice and affordable."}
{"text":"Great Lakes are like the neglected child in the Cleveland house hold; we all love it as much as can be but we don't speak of it often. There's nothing like this place in Los Angeles, it's like Cleveland captured in a dark bottle. An institution to say the least.  Over the holidays I was lucky enough to try Grand Cru for the first time and it knocked me on my ass with its citrus-y taste. No one can deny the killer buzz you get off of a couple bottles of Christmas Ale. The IPA (Commodore Perry-what a great f'n name) is pretty rad too. After a while some of the tastes seem too similar but they all do the trick which is to get you absolutely wasted."}
{"text":"So they have to get 5 stars for their beer alone. The amazing beverages they produce on a regular basis are unreal. I highly recommend beer school if you can make it. The things they do for the local economy and environment are phenomenal. There are better places in the area for food, but grabbing food here on a night out won't do you wrong."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in while in town on vacation because while we had come here once before for a drink, we didn't get to sit down to a meal. This time around we got a chance to sit down and have a bite in the outside patio and it was really great. I had a pizza with several different meats and banana peppers and my wife had a chicken sandwich and we both loved it. I also had a couple of their beers and thought they were killer.  Come for the beer stay for the food! I recommend you come during lunch, the reason we didn't eat on our first trip was that it was dinner time and the place was packed to the gills."}
{"text":"Love all things GLBC!! The beers are amazing, the food is great and the staff is incredible, kind and extremely knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Amish-raised beef, huh?  Yummers...  Great pub atmosphere, friendly service...since my bro had a six-pack of what he lovingly calls \"Christmas Crack\" in the refrigerator, I decided to try a lighter beer for contrast and it was gooooooood...wish I remembered the name of it. :/  Prices are a bit high, but not totally unreasonable."}
{"text":"I have been drinking Great Lakes beer in bottle over the last few years, finally this year I was able to come out and experience it first hand. All I will say is that this is a delightful experience for anyone that is into craft beer. Anyways good beer, good food, and a wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the beer for a while now and I talked my wife into checking out the restaurant while we were in town. The layout of the place is really cool. It's been carved out of old storefronts so there are several entrances, an upstairs, a cellar, and on a cool summer day a great patio. We went on a Friday night and they were pretty busy. Still got a table within a few minutes and our server was great. We shared a beer sampler so we could try out some of the stuff that I can't find in bottles. Our server also added a few glasses of some of their very newest and experimental tastes. They were... Not good! But the rest were fantastic. If you like a real beer (not that Sam Adams crap) try their Rye of the Tiger or the Lake Erie Monster when it's in season. Now onto the food. I got a buckeye burger which features a peanut butter and chocolate flavored BBQ sauce. So good! It came with fries that were some of the best bar fries I've had. My wife got a veggie burger and salad and it was also very tasty. Some insider tips: they give free rides to and from the restaurant and bar when Cavs games are running (on their veggie oil powered bus). And if you didn't bring cash for parking (pops) you can park in the public lot behind the west side market which is just a short walk away (it's free)."}
{"text":"I should apologize to my friend who arrived an hour early who told me initially she would be late when i got caught in downtown Cleveland. My pleasurable apology.  We were in the basement which was a bit more rowdy than upstairs, but it was good because we were frequenting the brewer and restaurant for my birthday My friend held us a table in the basement that was meant for 4 for seven people which turned into eight for a mid-dinner visitor who was not expected to appear and did. The staff did a great job keeping the EtOH flowing for the table and we were pleased with the waters that they provided without asking.  I ordered the pretzel chicken $16 portion which there was a cheaper option which I can imagine would be quite small as mine was unbelievable in taste but rather small, for me that is. I could eat the chair I sat on and still be like Oliver and demand more please.  I opted out of the veggies for fries, 'Murica. The fries were very thick and most impressive. They were seasoned with a salt and herb that was fantastic, I would go back just to pitch for a plate. The mashed pototoes were very good, nothing outstanding about the taste but pleasant regardless. The chicken was worlds of great, I loved it so much. I did not find it to be covered in oil, it was nicely fried and was not over cooked. I got two large pieces which were, I imagine, shaved down chicken breasts instead of tenderloin. I could be wrong but point being you got some fine chicken.  Not to start a witch hunt, but I did get the bread pudding because I have a stalker boyfriend thing with bread pudding. I was told it was the best I will ever had and I did not think that. It was very buttery which was nice and the a la mode mixed well but the bread pudding itself was not flavor full and even with a swab of the ice cream butter run it was not 'dessert'  sweet or spiced well. enjoyable yes but not the best, so far that belongs to Hodge's on Euclid near E4th.  I got a number of drinks; no beer because beer before liquor..... and I went to Porco's and MarketGarden following GLB. I had some sort of sex drink that was bought for me which was excellent and very sweet with juices. I got a coke and dark rum I believe it was which was strong and flavorful of dark rum, and then a citrus drink I think that was a mule. Overall very appeased. Definitely going back and I was very happy. Basement bathroom was small but did the trick.    our table all got different items including the pulled pork sandwich which had a portion that was appearing as quite generous and large burgers all around."}
{"text":"GLBC is such a fun place. I highly suggest taking a brewery tour and beer school, very fun and informative if you're into craft beer - and you get lots of tastings! If you're popping in for a beer, check out their downstairs or upstairs bars as they are usually less busy."}
{"text":"Great brew pub in Ohio city!  Had the cleveliner Weiss whit beer that was extremely sour and truly fantastic!  Wish they would sell that nationwide so I could buy it in NJ!  Also had the pork schnitzel which was moist and flavorful.  My date and I split the local meat and cheese plate which was a highlight.  House made salami, pepper James and thick cut bacon with spent grain bread from the brewing process.  Highlight of my trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The beers are great. One aspect of GLBC that I did not know. If your going to a Cavs game, they have a van that takes you to and from the game for only a buck. So, park on 25th for cheep, have a beer and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"We went to get dinner and drinks on a weekday night, get there at 7:30 and the place is inexplicably closed. The sign on the door says they're open until 10...but they're closed. There's no note. No one answers the phone. I have run into this issue a few times in Cleveland and I just don't get it.  Thanks for being a royal waste of my time. Won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Great spot in Ohio City.  Never had a bad meal and the patio is awesome in the summer or the winter. Big fan of the Italian Market Pizza, and the All Meat Burger, and the Pretzel Chicken Entree."}
{"text":"Visited here on a trip to Cleveland.  It's a fun place, really big inside.  The beer is great and what brought us here.  I do not think they do tours...we didn't do one.  Food is decent.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"A must visit destination for lovers of craft beer. Bring one of the well established Cleveland breweries and restaurant it is busy most nights of the week. If you show up to a full house and aren't too picky about where you sit try the pub downstairs. It's first come first serve seat your self tables but has the same menu at the upstairs restaurant, also many times there are exclusive pub feature beers that can only be found here.  The entire place has a wonderful old world pub feel that makes you feel welcome. They have some traditional american fare that pair with great with all of their local brews. One of my favorites is their pretzel crusted chicken. They have seasonal menu offerings and always produce good fare but beer is best here.  If you happen to visit during the winter months be sure to sample their coveted Christmas Ale."}
{"text":"We have used the Rockefeller Room (upstairs) for networking events in the past. The food went through Sammy's. There is small bar up there they can staff for you and serve either Great Lakes or offer a full bar. The staff was great, even helping me to box up the leftovers (which I gave to the hungry homeless guy in the parking lot). It is a great way to impress out of towners, and they loved the beer."}
{"text":"Go for the beer, not the food.  Had to send my soup back, found white bristles of something in it.  No one at the table enjoyed the food.  I did love my beer.  We should have known the food wasn't to good when only one other table was taken.  Its great to have a beer, but go elsewhere to eat.  The girl who'll always finish her meal, even if she's not to thrilled with it wouldn't even finish her food.  Another friend hated the soup she ordered, said it had a bad after taste.  The meat and cheese appetizer was good, but they don't actually make any of that there, its from stores in the market across the street.  My friend that ordered the fish and chips wasn't too happy either.  It was good enough for her to eat, but she said she's had better from the frozen food aisle."}
{"text":"good beer. great happy hour smells funny go have a beer"}
{"text":"I had the cider which is not on the menu but delicious, light and so refreshing! My parents and I are from SoCal and came to eat around 5:00 pm on a Friday. We were seated right away and for dinner I ordered the brew house burger and added an egg, avocado, and grilled onions . The beef is grass fed and very hardy ! Delicious crispy fries too!  In a cute area where you can walk around and pick up some yummy ice cream at Mitchels after dinner."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland for a conference. Came at a good time, as Tribe made it to the Series! I was there the week of Oct 17.   The restaurant has indoor, outdoor and biergarden seating. The biergarden is an inbetween indoor/outdoor seating area. We sat there. Glad we did! It was nice!   This is what the table ordered:  Me: Pierogies and a bowl of cheddar and ale soup. Loved the pierogies! It came with sour cream. I've only ever had the frozen box kind, so I thought this was very yummy :) The cheddar beer soup was delicious but it was THICK and very rich. I could not finish it. I wish it were a little lighter. But it was REALLY good.  Friend 1: She got the butternut squash ravioli. ((my observation- you get very little ravioli for the price)). She loved it!   Friend 2: Got the prosciutto and apple pizza. She liked the quality of the prosciutto. She enjoyed the flavors together. She wasn't able to finish in one sitting, but enjoyed it as leftovers a few days later. :)  I will definitely come back next time I ever find myself in the area!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland. I'm surprised I've never written a review! The food is always great, and we try something new every time. Their grainy mustard is amazing - we have gone there just for that!  You can't go wrong with any of the beer. I love to try their seasonal, but the Edmund Fitzgerald or Dortmunder are my go to if I'm not feeling adventurous.  Also, you have to check out all three floors. My favorite is the lower levels. I love the exposed stone; it just feels cozy."}
{"text":"This review is for the food at the restaurant only. I think this place has great food. It's not overpriced but average prices. The food is great tasting and good quality. Great place to go on the weekends to get a good quality average dinner! The 2 times that I have gone there has been a long wait .. About 45 minutes. Seems to always be busy"}
{"text":"Capsule: Great Lakes Brewing Company offers a fine assortment of craft beers in a warm, inviting atmosphere, but some food offerings are a touch too conventional. Full review below.  As an old Clevelander, I''m delighted by the revitalization of Downtown, and particularly the commercial renaissance of Ohio City. I was a kid in the OC 25 years ago, and prior to the quaint brewpubs across from the West Side Market, people visited the area for the adult bookstores and peep shows just down the street at Clark Avenue. It wasn't pretty.  Great Lakes Brewing rightfully claims to be the flagship of this urban renewal, buying a 19th-c. brick building at Market and 26th in 1988 to found Ohio's first  craft brewery. They've since expanded the brewpub into several adjacent historic spaces and the brewery into the building across the street (the free tour of which is cool and serves as a nice prologue to dinner--and lets you skip the wait list at this very popular place).   The huge GLBC space is divided into multiple dining and bar areas, including a beer garden, rathskeller, and (literally) tons of the building's original wood manifested in the original mahogany bar. It is a beautiful space to grab a pint or three and dinner. The brewery doesn't overextend itself, featuring only about six year-round styles (including the famed Edmund Fitzgerald Porter), but the seasonals and experimental brews are piped in here directly from across the street (through a beer pipeline--how cool is that?).  Sadly, though, GLBC's menu is good but not great. The local and sustainable emphasis (much produce from the giant urban Ohio City Farm with whom they partner) is admirable, but several menu items lack imagination. Among recent orders, the white bean veggie burger was deliciously unusual and the pretzel-encrusted chicken fine in principle, but the meat was a touch dry for the latter and the smashed potatoes that accompanied the meal were rather dull. Cést la vie.  So I'm withholding a star from this super cool place because I know that there's a better meal in there. But I'll surely be back to find out."}
{"text":"The mac & cheese is unbelievable. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: just okay micro-brew pub.  Great Lakes Brewing Company is a fine little craft brewery based in Cleveland, OH. Okay, so they're not super little, with their beers found in 14 states. But I've lived in St Louis and was raised in Milwaukee, two of the biggest beer cities in the country, and GLBC just didn't cut it for me.  I came into their pub location in Ohio City (part of Cleveland) a stone's throw from their brewery. The main bar area is cramped but we sat in their (covered for the winter) beer garden. This area was much more inviting, open and warm.  Our waitress was attentive the whole meal, and understanding when we waited for around 30 minutes for our friends to show up. For those of you coming with wheelchairs, they'll gladly bring you through the back area in the winter to seat you.   Concerning food: Katie K. and I started splitting the Stilton Cheddar Ale Soup ($6) and an order of Brewer's Barley Pretzels ($9). The beer cheese soup wasn't very good. I'm partial to places that let you pour your own beer into the soup, which is not the case here. You couldn't taste much but cheese, and the soup had an extremely off-putting gritty texture to it. Not great by itself, but fine for dipping the pretzels into. The pretzel plate came with two large pretzels (enough for two people) stacked in the middle of a plate surrounded by mustard dollops. The pretzels were great, warm and doughy. I really liked the brown mustard given, but had an issue overall; there were 3 dollops of brown mustard and 3 of yellow, both kinds which tasted right out of a squeeze bottle. They weren't bad, but I'd expect more variance and/or quality from a craft brewery, and especially for the price.   For the main course I got the Fish & Chips ($13). One long, fried piece of cod with fries, tartar sauce, and coleslaw. I don't enjoy slaw or tartar anyway so I won't comment on them. The fries were delicious but the special spices were layered on too thick and rendered a third of my fries inedible. The fish was passable, but again just not up to par.  Concerning the beer (which is the reason this place exists): Eh.  I had two glasses of their Eliot Ness Amber Lager. Ambers are my favorite style of beer, and kudos to GLBC for still making it as so many others drop it from rotation. It's a darker beer with a rich taste and 6.2% ABV ($5 a piece on tap).   But shame, shame, shame on GLBC for their overall beer selection. The day we came they had 10 beers on tap, 5 of which were IPAs with another APA thrown in for good measure. I understand pale ales are trendy now, but come on and offer a bit of variety. Isn't that the whole purpose of craft breweries, giving us choice as beer drinkers? Severe disappointment.   Great Lakes Brewing Company did not win me over. There are so many more craft breweries with better beer and more character. 3 stars only because of the service and the pretzels."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great prices!   We came here on a Monday night in June and had dinner on the patio. I got the Po'Man sandwich (kielbasa, peirogies, and saurkraut), and my boyfriend had the Bratwurst & Pierogi entree. I think our meals were about $13 each. I'm not from Ohio, so I was eager to try several of the Great Lakes beers. We tried the Gilgamesh, W 25th Street Hefeweizen, Burning River Pale Ale, and the Lightkeeper Blonde Ale. Our favorite was the Hefeweizen, but all were good. Drafts were $5, cans were $4. I'm going to be back in Ohio in a few weeks, and I already know I want to come back."}
{"text":"On any out of town trip, leave it to me to sniff out the local breweries and their adjacent brewpubs.  It's not really an art, there's this thing called Yelp and this other thing called Google, but it is a hobby.    The nice thing about lunching with buddies is the opportunity to share all over the menu.  Starting with the beer sampler.  Hello, Nosferatu.  We shared the pretzel crusted chicken which was impressively moist, the brat/pierogi platter, and the Old World Burger, which was AWESOME.  On par with my favorite burgers.  The accompanying housemade chips and cheese sauce were also amazing.  Squeeeee.  I wish Great Lakes was here in Chicago, but it'll be on my to-do during my next Cleveland visit.  I liked it so much, I made us stop into the airport outpost on the way home.  It was on the way to the gate and all and I needed a snack."}
{"text":"I remember first coming here during the summer of 2013, with a friend of mine that is.  Also the very first time dining here in Ohio City as well.  One thing I didn't like is that our waitress kinda pay attention here and there, and was kinda slow, but however friendly either way.  I ordered the chicken bacon mac n' cheese, it was very delicious, even Kraft has nothing on you guys.  We also walked over to the gift shop next door, they had a good selection of Great Lakes merchandise, matter of fact, I bought myself a Great Lakes keychain bottle opener; even the person who was at the register was friendly as well.  Definitely a great experience here as well; I look forward to my next return here.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Best beer on the planet (yes I've tried them all except in Antartica).  Food?  Just order the pretzel chicken and shut up.   Christmas Ale is the nectar of the gods. But when, pray tell, will you bring back the George Washington Wooden Tooth Porter??"}
{"text":"Two words: Christmas Ale!  Sure, I've had the great pleasure of sipping this magical potion from a bottle before, but it's a completely different experience to get it straight fresh from the tap.   I can't tell you much else as I was stuck on two back-to-back pints of that lovely Christmas Ale. Good conversation, lots of laughs and a photo opp (complete with shit-eating grins) made for a memorable evening at the pub. Make note that slow, deliberate sips and liberal chugs of water are your best friend when consuming this seasonal brew - 7.5% ABV is no joke!  The best part? As we were walking to our car around the block, we inhaled free smells of the fragrant hops (Jimmy John's: You don't have anything on Great Lakes!). Thanks Great Lakes, for making the neighboring blocks smell like Christmas morning."}
{"text":"This is always a great place to stop by when in Ohio City. Great food and atmosphere to pair with the national brewery. Atmosphere here is always great. Downstairs pub is my favorite to hang out in, like a classic all brick basement. Main bar area on the first floor is an older, wooden bar, very intricate woodwork. Food here is awesome. I have always had various sandwiches here, and been very pleased. My fiance is a big fan of the pretzel chicken. My favorite sandwich is the \"Po'Man\" any Polish boys dream (especially on Dyngus Day). A sandwich with local kielbasa, pierogis, and sauerkraut, yes, all on the same sandwich. My arteries may clog a little when I eat it, but it'd be a good way to go. For the side, always get the tator kegs. They refer to their homemade side as tator kegs, as tots are not an appropriate description of these behemoths. They change the daily flavors, and are well worth the upcharge. The beer for Great Lakes is well known by about anyone who enjoys craft beer. They have their solid year-round brews like Dortmunder Gold and Eliot Ness. Solid seasonals for each time of year, my personal favorite as the Oktoberfest. For a larger brewery, they also do a good job of keeping a few pub-only options available. All in all a great place to go. The atmosphere is fun, the beer and food are outstanding, and the prices very reasonable. Definitely a recommendation I make to all."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it really is one of my favorite places to visit in the Cleveland area. Their beers are awesome and if you have never been before you should definitely stop by. We always at the least get a appetizer as well and their food is what I would call \"high quality bar food\" set at a good price point. The only downside to this place is that it is a little bit of a victim of its own success if you ask me. That is, the place is always crowded and the wait times for lunch can get to be a bit of a pain. Also, the staff is certainly running on high gear as well and even though they are rushed we have never lacked for service. Bottom line, if you can brave the wait it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service average.  The wait for a table, eternity.  You need to figure out a reservation system that works.  You need to tell people accurately 30 minutes verses 1 hour and thirty minutes.  Parking a problem."}
{"text":"I really liked my visit here.  The ambiance is great, both inside and outside. They have a lot of seating, and a great selection of both beer and food.  I had the burger, which was more than decens, but not fantastic. The total experience is clearly four stars."}
{"text":"5 stars for the outdoor patio.  3 stars for the food.  I ordered the Spinach Salad and a side of French Fries.  The table behind me ordered the macaroni and cheese and they said it was just okay.  The spinach salad was underwhelming...kinda boring with no standout flavor.  Fries are slightly odd, actually.  They look double fried and they are served with a very spicy orange mayonnaise dipping sauce.  I love very spicy food so I liked the sauce but for the average person the heat on it may be too aggressive.  Service is fair.  I should have ordered one of the sandwiches.  The guy next to me ordered a burger with BBQ sauce, onion straws and smoked cheddar that looked awesome.  Lesson learned..."}
{"text":"Great Lakes is good for one thing: its beer. And maybe their patio, if you are lucky enough to even get a spot. Unfortunately, I feel that Great Lakes' food does not stack up and is overpriced given the quality. I ordered a pear salad once, and the pears were warm (why, just why?) making the whole salad warm. I sampled my husband's burger and it wasn't anything special. Does Great Lakes make wonderful beer? Yes. Does their restaurant have a great atmosphere? I suppose so, but the crowds and long waits aren't worth it to me. Go have a cookout and enjoy their brews in the comfort of your own home, or at the hundreds of less-busy restaurants that have them on tap."}
{"text":"Great beer! My favorite visit was during Christmas in July! They have a great outdoor patio during the summer and great restaurants around for food!"}
{"text":"Visited for the public brewery tour. Awesome tour guide provided my wife and I an inside look to GLBC. I was impressed to see how much GLBC does for the locals and how much they care about the area. After the tour we decided to get some food at the pub which also lived up to its expectations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker per say, but I was in Ohio City and had lunch with a friends.  I tried a light ale and it was great!"}
{"text":"Anyone living in the OH area knows all about Great Lakes.  Most of their stuff is rated B+ on beer advocate, which sounds about right; maybe not standing out, but definitely some solid brews.  However, the dinning experience in the restaurant of this hometown Cleveland brewpub translates into one of the best meals I've ever had.  I should mention that this review is only based on one visit, but the atmosphere, presentation, and menu range were totally impressive.  Pairing several select GL beers on draft with our orders made the experience even more memorable.  Eager to return."}
{"text":"The beer was pretty good (oktoberfest and their golden lager one...forgot the name)...but the food was pretty bad...The pretzel burger was messy and also not as tasty as I would have thought. I've had way better burgers and also better preztel burgers."}
{"text":"I haven't been to GLB in a number of years. I was shopping at the West Side Market and thought it would be nice to get some Christmas Ale at the source and have a nice lunch. We got their at 12:30p on Weds the day before Thanksgiving. We had a 1 hour wait. Okay so we can see if a seat opens up at one of the bars. We were in luck. A 2 seater opened up about 5 mins into our wait. We got seated right away.  Sat upstairs by the window. Nice view of the street. Ordered a Christmas Ale. Reviewed the menu. All prices are the same. Everything is between $10-$16. No matter if it's a burger or salad. The soup is $9. A bit steep.   My lunch date and I both got the fish and chips. And we got the cheese soup as a bit of an appetizer.   The soup took about 30 mins to arrive. And it had a bit of a skin on the top so it had been sitting. It was also not really filled to the top of the crock. And it was not very hot. It was still tastee but not ideally served to us.   About another 20 mins we finally got the fish and chips. Portion not huge. 1 larger price of fish and a handful of fries and a small scoop of coleslaw. It was good. Again not hot. More room temp. It had good flavor. The tarter sauce was good. Fish was nicely battered, fries were good, it was just not hot. And we both thought there could be more food.   Let me just say it was not a horrible experience. I'd go back. Just know wait is long. Beer is good. Food it a bit pricey for a what you get. In summer you can sit on the patio. It's an experience. Just know that going in."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Cleveland and now living in the land of ALL of the beer, Asheville North Carolina. I gotta say, every time I'm up in Cleveland, I make it a priority to head to Great Lakes a few times, mostly for beer, sometimes for food. It NEVER disappoints. Every beer I've had is an exemplary model of it's style. The folks are so friendly and I always leave having had some great unexpected conversation. I would take Great Lakes over any place down in my neighborhood any day, any time. Bonus points if it's snowy outside and the GLCA is on draft!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner there on a weeknight in 8/05 and it was very enjoyable.  Our server - who was terrific - told us, at our request, about the building's history (it opened in 1870 and it was a grainery).  He also showed us the downstairs area after our meal and that was neat; they have a pub, and an Irish band was playing.  All of the food was delicious, but the absolute highlight was our dessert.  Their famous bread pudding has a whisky butter sauce and the portion was large (which it *should* be, for the price).  Needless to say, we shared it....we spent time in that (Ohio City) neighborhood beforehand.  Ohio City is one of Cleveland's oldest and most historic neighborhoods.  It's a revitalized area which has a small but eclectic array of restaurants, shops and people."}
{"text":"Went to GLBC this past weekend for a friend's birthday and a while back before while hitting the town.  Went fairly \"early\" for food with my group of friends and had a nice server.  Food was fairly good for what it is but was disappointed my original decision for food was out (Ohio City Pasta) so I had to substitute it for the stuffed chicken.  The chicken was flavorful and the veggies cooked well.  The chicken was a little dry, but then again it might've been because it was white meat.  They had a live band playing that night which was fun to watch and cool.  With the band and the influx of people it started getting hard to hear our conversations between us at the table but it's to be expected with a band and on a weekend."}
{"text":"Went on the brewery tour. 5 bucks for the tour and 4 half pours of your choice of beer. The tour guide was knowledgeable and seemed passionate about the company and was willing to answer everyone's different questions. You start with a short video on the history and direction the company wants to go. Then you got to see their bottling and brewing facilities. We didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant but the beer during the tour and after in the cellar bar was very good and fresh."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic night here. We came here on a mother and son weekend. Our boys are 8 years old and they were great with them and they loved the cheese pizza. The flight of beers was fantastic. Will come again"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a pre-dinner drink. The Christmas ale did not disappoint and it was fun to get it before the \"masses.\" definitely don't be discouraged by a long wait time.... Just go downstairs to the pub and enjoy a beer in a fun atmosphere while you wait!"}
{"text":"Oktoberfest beer tapped!!! Great Midwestern menu!  Good food! Band was playing.  Nice place"}
{"text":"I love the beer here- it's hard to find a micro brewer that has so many tasty beers.  The restaurant itself it is a fun place to go because it is full of character and characters.  Great place for people watching, particularly if you are sitting outside.    The food is pretty good for bar food.  I would recommend the soft pretzel and the sausage sampler to just about anybody.  Goes great with the beers.  We've eaten here probably five or six times and each time it meets expectations.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"People don't go here for the food.  It's all about the beer and the beer itself deserves five stars.  The service was ok, food was decent but nothing spectacular.  There was no wait to be seated on a Tuesday evening.  The restaurant is a neat building. Sit in the cellar if you can.  All you can smell is the beer!    If you're looking for a good restaurant to eat, there are better choices in the area.  But definitely head to GLBC after for drinks!"}
{"text":"The best place ever. We though we were in for just some great beers, but the foods were also equally awesome. Service as excellent. We had the bratwurst plate, the specials salad with fried chicken cutlets, fried chicken with curry sauce, BBQ ribs, fried calamari and fish and chips. Desserts were good too. We had a chocolate cake and a cheesecake which were so decadent and rich. This is perfect place to go if you're entertaining a friend from out town. It can get a little busy in the evenings but you can hang out at the bar, get an appetizer and drinks and the wait won't be too unbearable. Love it, and the next time I'm in town I will have to come here again,"}
{"text":"I called the number above and listened to a voicemail maze.   \"Press 3 for reservations.\"  I press 3 and get connected with the operator.   \"We don't take reservations over the phone.\""}
{"text":"Excellent beer. Delicious, very good food. Great building, including the rathskeller (lower level).    If you are in CLE, visiting this place is a must."}
{"text":"Brought some friends here yesterday that were visiting from out of town.  We've been here before, but they had not.  We were seated pretty quickly, which was a plus.  Our waiter, Scott, was very pleasant, but not very attentive.  My friend and I ordered waters, and her husband ordered a beer.  She and I were also planning to order drinks along with the waters, but he took off to get the beer before either of us could say anything, which kind of ticked me off.  Then my roasted beet salad was missing the feta cheese, and we tried numerous times to flag him down, because our table was also missing salt and pepper shakers. It was next to impossible to catch his eye. My boyfriend was waving with his arm up in the air, which should have worked, but I was almost done with my salad by the time he finally came over.  Aren't waiters supposed to check back at least once after serving the food to make sure that everything is OK?    Anyway, we called his attention to the fact that my salad had been missing the feta.  Instead of apologizing and maybe making a concession on our bill, he went back and brought me a little dish of feta!  I was flabbergasted, to say the least.  Our friends tried to be gracious and attributed the bad service to the fact that the restaurant was kind of busy, but that doesn't fly with me.  Sadly, they left Scott a generous tip, even though he really didn't deserve it.    The food was really good.......too bad the service wasn't better."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken,  burger,  vegan burger and fish and chips.  They all were mediocre.  Two stare is very fair (only based on their food). I will not be back."}
{"text":"The menu here is small but fierce. I recommend going with their specials. Plenty of space with an outdoor patio and covered patio with a fire place and an expandable roof. Then a bar upstairs and downstairs. If you have not tried Great Lakes beer I recommend getting the sampler. This is what this place is known for! The Admiral Perry and Cleveland brown are my top favs! Food wise try the pizzas they are original and very tasty with a thin crust and authentic taste."}
{"text":"I went for the food...my husband and son went for the beer.  We were all very happy !! The atmosphere is fun and the beer is of course the BEST in Cleveland  Loved the Sausage Sampler and the  Eliot Ness Amber Lager"}
{"text":"Truly a Cleveland institution. I have been going here since the basement pub was a 5 foot bar with a few stools and that's it... besides the brewing tanks. That was back in the day when you could get hammered without the staff cutting you off after three beers. The good old days...  Anyway, almost every beer they make is tight and on point for the style. It's easy to bag on them for making things like Elliot Ness, Dortmunder and Wright Pils.... After all they are not 26 percent alcohol and you don't have to stand in line for hours to drink them. But if you have had great beer made by people that really care about what they do, especially in countries like Germany, England, Belgium, etc, you know what a treasure GLBC is to beer  lovers.  The things I'm neutral on are the food and their \"green\" policies. The food is average to good, but expensive. Their environmental policy is fine, but I do not need to be reminded of it incessantly. I don't usually make my decisions based on politics and their policy does not make me more or less likely to spend my money here.  Other things: Love the bar area, beer garden, patio seating and downstairs pub. The first floor dining and upstairs are not very appealing.  Gets uber crowded. Best bet is lunch when one of the OG bartenders is there, he's great. Some of you know of whom I speak."}
{"text":"Gotta love the beer but the food is just okay and a bit overpriced. There are plenty of better spots in Ohio City or Cleveland in general."}
{"text":"Great older wooden look inside.  Multiple levels.  Tons of microbrews on tap. The burger was amazing, one of the best I've ever had.  Comes on a pretzel bun, mmmm."}
{"text":"History, that is what i love about this place.  If you have a chance to book a tour I highly recommend that.  If you have a chance to host a corporate function, great for that also.  OR if just for a drink/dinner/lunch outside,,,,,,,,,,you get the point right?  Great place"}
{"text":"We are at the pub and was very pleased with the menu for \"brewery food\" . I want to come back and try everything! Lots of items are locally sourced and many are vendors from the west side market they use which I love!   You have to get the pretzels as an appetizer if you come here !  We also did the brewery tour- you get four healthy \"sample\" servings of the beer (already strong) and was neat to learn the history behind it. We had an older gentlemen as our tour guide and he was funny and made the tour special for all of us!"}
{"text":"Came here with a client while in town on business and absolutely loved it.  We sat outside and it was just beautiful- such a nice neighborhood!  Scott was our server and he was awesome- conversational and cool.  Food was great- the meat/cheese plate to start was out of this world and the fries were so good with the parmesan on top- YUM!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Come for the beer and find that the food isn't too shabby either. Great lakes is by far one of my favorite breweries in the area. Both them and Southern tier put out an incredible roster of ales. This was my second trip to the brew Pub. We stopped about a year ago on another return trip to Buffalo. I knew the beer was going to be good, but was really taken back by the food this time. Luckily we were there in time to get a fresh Nosferatu, a wonderfully hoppy red imperial ale. In addition my Wife and i split a Cobb Salad and Margarita pizza. the salad was pretty standard faire. Bacon, turkey, avocado and Swiss over mixed green. accompanied by a blue cheese vinaigrette. Not bad, just didn't really wow me. Our pizza on the other hand, now that's a different story. 10 or so inch brick over pizza with fresh heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. Amazing. i know it doesn't sound like much, but the flavor or the garlic, oil and basil was heavenly. I'd also like to point out that the Brew pub makes a point of trying to use locally raised meat and veggies and organics whenever possible. Like i said we came for the beer and left with happy full bellies. Will return for sure!!"}
{"text":"In a city with limited beer options, Great Lakes stands out. There pub is rather expansive covering 3 floors and a patio. There food looks good on the menu but I found it uninspired. My fries were soft and burnt at the same time. Not sure how that happens and it's not like anyone even asked me how they were. While the beer was good, there was only one beer that was a pub exclusive. Do yourself a favor and go to the store and buy a six pack of singles."}
{"text":"Came here after the Brewery tour (highly recommend! $5 and you get 4 samples of beer!) for a late dinner. Loved it! We were lucky to have some beautiful fall wether in October, so we decided to sit OUTSIDE on the patio! Also learned from the tour, that they use the extra barley from making the beer in their pretzels and in there pizzas! We started with some appetizers and got the Nach-ohs, fried eggplant, barley pretzels, and a Margherita pizza to share. The nach-ohs were huge and you can easily share with 3+ people. The barley pretzels were also tasty, but I thought they were overly salted unfortunately. Best decision was to split a pizza as an appetizer. Quite yummy! Then for the main entree, I went with the Mac n' cheese. I know, weird choice for a brewery, but it sounded so good! Cheesy pasta, with bits of bacon and chicken. How can you say no? Very delicious and I would get this again! My friend also got the pretzel-crusted chicken and that may have been the meal of the night! Would definitely come back here to bring the fiancee!   Pros: - very large menu, that even allows vegetarians to find something to eat here - great beer selection (for those of you that like beer) - fun way to end the night after the brewery tour  Cons: - my friend also got the Mac n' Cheese, and her's did not look as tasty and she definitely had les chicken and bacon then I did!  Why I gave it a 4.... Great place to eat at the brewery tour (which I also highly recommend!). More beer to drink and tasty selection of food. The pizza and pretzels also contain the used barley from the beer making process. The Mac n' Cheese was so delicious! It just seemed a little odd that my friend also ordered this dish and her's was not as appealing and clearly lacking in the amount of protein that was present. Definitely sit on the patio if the weather permits! Will definitely come back with the fiancee for the food and the brewery tour!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Ohio.  I finally was in town with the boyfriend and had a chance to stop in.  The vibe is so warm and friendly, the seats are comfy, and of course the beer and food are great.  It was JUST chilly enough that I didn't want to sit outside, but we settled right in.  I got the pretzels, a MUST, and sausage platter (which was delicious) and a Cleveland Sub.  Oh, and a few beers, of course.  All the food is GREAT and you leave stuffed and happy.  It's just such a gem, everyone should go in at least a few times a year."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat ever. The best beer in the city for sure. Great food, everything I have ordered is great from the pretzels to the Stilton cheddar soup. The parking is easy and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Ever since Falbo gave me half a case of the sampler, I thought why not, Cleveland should have a beer scene.  I've been to the heart of the Brewery and it was worth the trip. The Edmund is tasty. The River is hoppy.   Good work, mistake on the lake... Just kidding."}
{"text":"The local beer here is as good as it gets in Cleveland, so it has a lot of admirers locally.  Unfortunately, the beer in Cleveland isn't that great, and if you've been in a city with a vibrant local beer scene, you're likely to come away disappointed.  It's fine beer, but not as stellar as others make it out.  The food?  Perfectly serviceable for a brewpub, if slightly on the spendy side.  I've been twice now, and liked it both times, but each time found it about $5-10 more than I wanted to pay.  Still, for the best beer in the Land of Cleve, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I ordered a burger well-done.  It was more like med-rare.  The burger had WAY to much pink in the middle. Plus the fact the wait was extremely long on a cold night with people coming in and going out it made the waiting area uncomfortable.  I would go back for the beer but not the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriends mom had been dying to go here and sample the beer so we went for dinner last weekend to celebrate her birthday. We were seated at a table on the outside patio and it was perfect with the nice weather.   I am actually not a fan of beer so I had a tasty glass of Pinot Noir but everyone else in my group was raving about the beer and debating which were their favorites.   For my meal I ordered the roasted beet salad and it was phenomenal. I am biased to anything with beets in it because they are one of my favorite foods but it really was delicious. I would definitely order it again. Even though it was a salad, it was still filling.   My boyfriend ordered the Bratwurst & Pierogi which I had some of and we both enjoyed it.   This place has a fun atmosphere and good food, I am sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"We sat outside and had a great experience! I LOVED the food and they had a really nice porter and sour beer that I am really into.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I'm having my wedding reception there.  The service has been wonderful.  The atmosphere is more of a classy pub than a country club, so it's not a \"traditional\" wedding venue, but it's perfect if you have a small wedding and want an intimate, unique atmosphere.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Jingle bells, jingle bells Christmas Ale all the way! Oh what fun it is to be  At Great Lakes Brewery.   Visited just in time for the 2014 release. :) Arrived before noon, and there was plenty of seating. Left after 1pm and it was PACKED - this was on a Friday. Get there early or expect to potentially stand for a length of time. There's also an area down and upstairs for additional dining. Food was great. Definitely get the pretzel and mustard plate to pair with your brew."}
{"text":"Wanted to rate higher but the Session IPA I tried was 3 star at best, in addition, the \"I'm a hipster and don't give a sh$t about you\" service is the reason for the overall two star review. We sat down at the patio tables and were ignored while some tatooed server talked to his friends next to us. We had to order at bar and bring back to table. I'm a beer lover and found this to be really dissapointing, especially in a competitive industry."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to sit outside and enjoy a yummy craft beer.  Great Lakes Brewing was one of the standouts for me at Ithaca's Beer Fest last year, so when in Cleveland...  We weren't disappointed.  Great place to keep everyone of all ages happy.  Not the most amazing food I've ever had, but the beer and ambiance make up for it."}
{"text":"Wow, going here last weekend was really great, and it brought back the memories.  When I was a young man, just turned 21, I worked for a cable station as a camera man, and got to cover the restaurant just before it opened (even got one of my first beers there, right from the pigtail of their first brewing vats.) Heck, I remember that the place was so new, they hadn't even placed the cobblestones in the street out front, it was still gravel!  Now, the Great Lakes Brewing Company is a Cleveland institution, and deservedly so.   Creating amazing beers like their \"Elliot Ness\" and \"Edmund Fitzgerald\" (two of my favorites,) the Brewing Company has gone from a small, craft beer-type business, to the biggest brewery of its kind in Cleveland. They do a great tour of their facility, just round the corner from the restaurant, and it was fun. You also, for the modest fee of a quarter, get to sample some of their fine libations. Our tour guide was funny and genial, and he knew his stuff. The plant is a marvel of technology, and I had no idea so much could fit in such a small space. It's really a must to check the place out if you can (tour dates and time are listed on their website, so check it out:)  The restaurant was good, but busy. Many tourists and other folks come down just for the a beer and the bragging rights, but you really should check out the food.   One cool thing we learned was that the grain used to make the beer is ALSO used to make the breads and especially the AMAZING pretzels served in the restaurant. A taste that my wife and I really enjoyed. Our server, a fine young lady named Katie, did a great job taking care of us and was very knowledgeable. BTW, a warning; if you get the chicken sandwich with the honey chipotle sauce, GET LOTS OF WATER, that sauce is great but it's HOT:)  The place was a bit loud, but I think that was due to the number of people there (A busy Saturday,) and parking was a bit tough. There are lots a short jog away if you get stuck for a parking spot, and decently priced too.  All in all, if you want to brew up a taste experience, with a little education on the side, check out the famous Great Lakes Brewing Company, you'll be happy you did:)  (Now, if they were only hiring;)"}
{"text":"Booked a brewery tour in advance & had a great time.  The staff was very informative & friendly.  We grabbed dinner at the brewery afterwards & had a very little wait despite it being a busy Saturday night.  Really a great stop if you're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I'm totally a fan of the craft beer trend. I don't drink a lot but I do enjoy having a beer every once in awhile, usually while I'm at a bar with my dad watching hockey. My dad is a HUGE beer drinker, but not one of those bud light cans while grilling hot dog beer drinkers. No, my dad tries a new beer every week. There could be blueberry ale, banana lager, or a chocolate stout in my fridge at any given moment because my dad thought it would be cool to try. So in a sense, we Ohioans owe a lot to Great Lakes for being the first microbrewery in Ohio and making it a thing in this state.  After a trip to the Westside Market (visiting markets in cities is also one of our favorite things to do, and the Westside Market is MUCH bigger than Cincinnati's Findlay and Columbus's North), we decided to stop by Great Lakes. After all, it was right across the street and offered German and Polish delicacies as well as their beer. And there's a gift shop. Yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhh, gift shops.  The restaurant is split into sections: the brewhouse, taproom, beer garden, beer cellar, and a couple of others I honestly can't quite remember. We opted to sit in the beer cellar section, which is essentially the basement of the establishment. They have three booths, a small bar and a few tables to sit at. There are fermentation tanks in the cellar that make beer only for the restaurant, so if you eat here you can get beer you won't be able to purchase in grocery stores. Our server Allie was very attentive and explained the different brews they had for the day as well as giving us a thorough backdrop of the history of the Ohio City district. My dad and I noshed on the sausage appetizer platter (we did just stuff ourselves at the market) while enjoying the environment.   You have to like beer to really enjoy this place. I know it sounds obvious but many times people go to bars or restaurants thinking \"well, they'll have food I can enjoy or TVs or such\". While that idea isn't different here because the food is good and the atmosphere is casual enough to bring the kids, if you really want to take in and immerse yourself in the history of it all, you have to like beer. Otherwise, you're just going through the motions of going out to a restaurant. This is a cool place that beer lovers can appreciate.  Oh, and don't forget about that gift shop. I got this totally kick ass hoodie that my local Starbucks barista is jealous about. Yeah, hoodies!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about Great Lakes? The beer selection is phenomenal! I don't think I've had one I don't like. My personal favorite has to be the Edmund Fitzgerald. If you like a dark beer, this one will knock your socks off.   The brewery tour is really interesting. There is a lot of history behind the brewery, where it is located and the names of the beers they brew. They tour guides were extremely friendly and could answer just about any question that got thrown their way.  After our tour we ate at the restaurant. The food was really good. They try to incorporate their beer in a lot of different ways, from the pretzels to the breading they use. It really adds a nice flavor to the food, and if you pair the food with their suggestion, you won't be disappointed.   It's obvious that Great Lakes has made a huge effort in making sure their customers are satisfied. Despite the fact that we were there on a great weekend day and it was crowded, our food came out promptly, the servers were extremely happy and welcoming. I would go back over and over!"}
{"text":"We visited from out of town. Great beer, great atmosphere, and good service. We really enjoyed out time here and the vegan black bean burger was fantastic! I would defiantly come back here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday to get a seat right away. Service was quick and helpful. Menu isn't huge - but covers the basics and has a fun Polish influence! Slightly disappointed in the beer menu as there was only one dark beer on tap (the other was out). Went with the Edmund Fitzgerald, which is a beer I know and like.. however, I have had it before and I was hoping to have something we can't get in Grand Rapids from GLBC but no luck.  I had the fish and chips - one large fish that was good - slightly oily. Cheese soup was good! All around just an A-OK experience."}
{"text":"Christmas Ale Beer Cheese Soup Best local and fresh plate around  If it's nice out then definitely grab a spot outside, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After 5 years of living in Cleveland, I finally made it here when I visited on a weekend. The food was pretty affordable and tasty.  I ordered the pretzel chicken. Not too  much \"pretzel\" about it. Just your typical breading, but it tasted good. I would recommend the larger portion. The service was good but it was 3pm on a Friday.  I don't think the restaurant is worth a one hour wait on a Saturday night, but I'm glad I came."}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere, and great beer! Everyone loves the Christmas Ale- you can't really go wrong there- but the Holy Moses, Dortmunder, and Highlander Scottish Ale are pretty fantastic, too"}
{"text":"Being from Northeastern Ohio, I build up Great Lakes brewing, their beers are top notch (Burning River being my personal favorite pale), however on my first stop in to eat I found myself extremely dissappointed.  From the beginning things started off on the wrong foot.  My mother and I had to interject in the conversation the hostess was having with who I assume was the manager on duty, just to get ourselves noticed so we could be seated.  When asked where we'd like to sit, we said \"outside\", they sat us in the patio, completely indoors.  I ordered a holy moses, it was a warm afternoon.  It's a good beer, but the lipstick on the glass definitely wasn't mine.  Nancy, our server, empathized and understood our disgust and brought me another beer (we paid for it, shouldn't have had to, but whatever).  My mother and I ordered the bruschetta which was two 1\" thick pieces of bread with skimpy toppings put on a plate, it looked rather boring, and lacked any creativity whatsoever.  The heirloom tomatoes were delicious although there were barely any to eat.   It should be noted that they use white cloth napkins, which is a terrible choice for casual dining, especially if used outdoors as Great Lakes does.  No matter how much they clean them, they'll never look clean, in fact, ours looked filthy.  For our entree, I had the ($11) reuben sandwich with green beans.  They may have given me 10 green beans which were badly dimpled and should have been thrown out days before.  The sandwich was tiny, and relatively flavorless, for $11 I chuckled as it was all I could do in the face of absolutely poor value.  My mother's cobb salad came out with greens so wilted, bruised and brown that I'd be embarassed to use them as rabbit-food, they were that bad.  Not one piece of lettuce looked fresh.  The hard-boiled eggs were probably some of the most overcooked eggs I have seen, the brown ring of overcooked yolk was nearly 1/8\" thick!  They had to have left the eggs in the water or steamer for well over 30 minutes to cook an egg that poorly.  The balsamic vinaigrettte was good, but couldnt mask the poor quality of the greens or overcooked grossness of the eggs.  All in all, I doubt I'd return to the brewpub for comestibles of any sort.  The beer is good, but after this poor experience at their brewpub, management really needs to get things back on track if they want to survive.  Goose Island's two restaurants serve very good food and concentrate on food quality just as much as they focus on the quality of their beers.  I wish I could say the same of Great Lakes.  See my review of Willoughby Brewing Co.  There's a place to go if you love beer and want a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Only in Cleveland for the night and was really excited to get to the home of Great Lakes beer.  I realllyy wanted to go on a brewery tour, but unfortunately they only do those on Fridays or Saturday's (you can book a tour at another time, if you have a larger group, for $100, if you call to arrange 4 weeks   First, the beer.  I was able to get a sampler of all their current beers on tap--9 samples for $16.   The atmosphere was very hip and relaxed, with outdoor and indoor seating, and when I went downstairs to the bathroom, I swear I heard live music.  I wasn't expecting Great Lakes to have a full menu, but the food was actually really good, and they use a lot of local ingredients, in addition to trying to incorporate their beer flavors into some of the dishes. I had a burger and fries, the burger was cooked perfectly, the fries were a little different and really good.  My parents also enjoyed their meals.  Even though we were stuffed, my dad can never resist when there's bread pudding on the menu, I'm not personally a bread pudding fan, but he seemed to love it.  Our waitress, sue, was super cute, attentive, and played along with all my dads jokes-couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Went on a brewery tour with a group of 13 for my birthday and we had a blast! We got to see the operation, learn about the company and its history, and try their year-round brews as well as a pub exclusive. Fun for a beer fan! If you want to book a tour, plan ahead as they often sell out well in advance."}
{"text":"I didn't care the beer but I'm no beer expert. My husband and brother didn't care for the Abbey Ale but liked the Elliot Ness. Neither of them were itching to take home any beer from their storefront.  There were lots of older (late 40s-60s) people in here. Maybe because we went on a Wednesday afternoon? I would try the other spots in the area next time.  The pub bites were great though! Alaskan cod in a beer batter. Crispy outside and soft, flakey fish inside."}
{"text":"Since everyone has already talked about how amazing the beer is here, i am going to say something that not that many people know about The Great Lakes Brewing Company.   Did you know they have a zero emissions brewery and have several VERY VERY Advanced systems inorder to produce ZERO solid waste from the restaurant. Its amazing. Its the only completely sustainable, completely green brewery in the COUNTRY. right here in cleveland.  its amazing.  - all the scraps from your plates are put in compost piles in a basement level. Its then sold as mulch to local farmers. - they buy only local ohio grown food - ALL VEGGIE OIL used in the making of the beer and food is used to power ALL distribution trucks for the ENTIRE brewery. zero emissions. -The plant is powered by all forms of renewable energy.   YES- DEFINATELY GO THERE FOR THE FOOD AND BEER. Christmas ale is what makes you a REAL clevelander. But  GO THERE TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by one of my absolute favorite breweries yesterday while up in Cleveland with friends for the weekend. I ordered the Christmas ale which was absolutely wonderful. The Christmas ale is one of their beers that I look forward to all year. While enjoying our beers, we got the pretzels with beer cheese and they obviously did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I kept hearing so many great things about Great Lakes  so I decided to try It out one Saturday afternoon. The bar looked awesome and was packed with a ton of different people, we were seated at a table right away in a room off the bar. The hostess was very friendly and warm.    Our waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the beer, but they were sold out of half the menu. There was only one cider on the menu and it was completely sold out, and there were no other gluten free options other than the very short cocktail list. The food looked appealing on the menu but was definitely nothing special in reality. My salad had a 2-3 small pieces of chicken, and my boyfriends  pulled pork sandwich was dry and slathered in what looked like a kraft single.  I would come here again for the bar atmosphere and friendly wait staff, but will probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"Restaurant: the lunch we had was very good. We had a pretzel burger with Great Lakes BBQ sauce and cheddar, and also a Cleveland Deli sandwich. Both were well balanced, but although the food is good, the real star of the show of course is the beer.   Most of the beer served in the restaurant is piped over under the street from their brewing and manufacturing plant, which is across the street. This means it is the freshest way to enjoy Great Lakes Brewery beer.   We went out here for a tour of the brew house. It was a very fun and informative tour, and the tour guide was very knowledgeable - both on the history of the Great Lakes Brewing Company and the area in which they do business.   Did I mention the tour was only $5 each, AND you get 4 small beers to enjoy as you walk around the area. Definitely worth the experience and a good way to spend a Saturday afternoon.   After the tour we went to the restaurant to get some lunch, then went to the gift shop since we were in the area.   They have a lot of sustainability principles that they follow which I appreciate, and some of the food used in the restaurant is grown right around the corner at an urban farm.   The whole experience makes me a bigger fan of GLBC because the beer speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Went in at about 6pm on a weekday and were seated right away. The service was good but the food was average. I am from out of town and would not eat here again if I was able to come back. However, if I was a local I may try it a few more times if I was stuck looking for a place to eat.  Pretzel chicken- 2 of us ordered this. We felt like the description was misleading. It was basically just breaded chicken. The pretzel did not add any unique flavor or texture. The salsa placed on top of the chicken was an awful combination and I ended up scraping it off. The potatoes were good but the string beans needed to be seasoned. Salt and pepper go a long way... Otherwise it was a well cooked piece of chicken.  Mac and cheese- this was good. Comes out looking runny but looks are deceiving. It was a nice balance of all of the ingredients in there. Would order again."}
{"text":"I live in the same building as Great Lakes Pub is at.  Want a burger, Fish & Chips; Beer.  You found the place.  Put food, nice look/feel and good service.  I like beer, you like beer.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Stopped here before my flight home to NJ.   Ordered a salad with very moist and warm chicken. Got the balsamic dressing on the side.  Bloody Mary's are delicious.  Lots of variety on the menu in terms of drinks.  Lots of beers as well."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! My boyfriend and I ordered the flight and the beer was pretty good. We had come with friends of ours And they both said that the Christmas ale is the best one, but they didn't have it available when we were there in July.  The staff was friendly and seemed to enjoy talking about the beer with us. After 1 flight, my boyfriend and I were both starting to feel goofy so 1 is definitely enough for 2 people!"}
{"text":"First time here, tried the chicken pesto sandwich with a Chillwave and it was  phenomenal! Great atmosphere followed by exceptional service. I'm coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Food was good, could of had a little more seasoning but still good. Bread pudding was to die for."}
{"text":"Burgers? Beer? Ohio City? What could be better? I was super looking forward to coming to Great Lakes because it is a Cleveland Institution! So when a bunch of us came here for a friend's birthday, I was so excited!  However, the food sizes were smallish, tasted just bland, and was still pretty costly. \"The fries were so hard they hurt my teeth\" is how my friend explained it. I mean, the beers are delicious, but a case of GLBC beer from Giant Eagle tastes exactly the same. They are a brewing company and make some seriously delicious beers, but I think you'd be better off at another restaurant ordering some GLBC beer.   The service though is really good! We had a huge group and some were even a little late. Our waiter was super accomodating and made sure we were alright and topped off our water throughout the night. When one of our friend's plates did not come out with the rest, the waiter was super nice about it and tried to get the order out ASAP.   I'd come back only if a huge group wanted to, but on my own, I'd probably head somewhere else."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows anything about Cleveland knows that Great Lakes Brewing Company is a huge part of its history. Although I've lived here since birth, I just got around to actually going a couple weeks ago. Everything was pleasant, and there was nothing really wrong with the restaurant. The waitstaff was friendly and our waitress was very accommodating to someone in my party's strict diet. I split the artichoke dip and buffalo chicken salad and both were good, but nothing too memorable. The patio is nice and great for people watching. The crowd was diverse, some families, some groups of friends, some younger and older couples. Prices are alright, for Cleveland I'd say they're a little steep. I know it's a sin to go to the Great Lakes Brewery and not try the beer, but I didn't. If I had, it may have earned the restaurant another star. I'll go back if someone else suggests it, but I prefer some of the other restaurants in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating, great service, great beer and great food. Great party of town as well, walking distance to a lot of different bars/restaurants. Great spot to go to if you're in town."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Was not able to do the tour but did try their beer.  One of the best burgers I have ever tried. I also ordered the Pretzel Crusted Chicken, I highly recommend it!  Their menu highlights that most of their ingredients are obtained from the  Westside Market next to them.  I'm not sure if this made the difference but the flavors of all the ingredients really did come together."}
{"text":"In town recently for the first time, I knew I had to check this place out. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30 and there was still a 45 min to 1 hour wait for 2 people. Luckily, this place is right across the street from the West Side Market and is in a cute neighbor hood with other restaurants and cafes to kill time exploring. There is also a company store attached to the restaurant where you can browse through memorabilia like t-shirts, growlers, and of course, beer! We ended up only waiting around 30 minutes. The beer was good and I order the Po'Man sandwich, which at first I was afraid would be messy, but in actuality was not and was super delicious. It was a local sausage with kraut, pierogies, and mustard. The restaurant is in an old building with many adjoining rooms and a bar area downstairs. Totally worth checking out when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food and seems like wait staff are being a bit more customer friendly.  In the past, many wait staff were doing patrons a 'favour' by allowing them to come in and spend their dough.  Now they're singing a nicer tune."}
{"text":"Went with a group here once and the food was pretty mediocre and the service was pretty lame.  I think the place needs a bit of a update...I would go here if someone else was paying and this was the only place open in cleveland."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since moving back to the area.   The things I really love about GLBC:  The beer is great, fresh, tasty.  I really love the Happy Hour Firkins on Thursday down in the cellar.  I had a Pumpkin Vanilla Bean Fusion a few months ago that was incredible.  The menu is excellent.  I swear I read the menu and feel like it's a list of every favorite food of mine.  The pierogies are great; The Italian Market Pizza is fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and stop by if you're in the area, a real gem."}
{"text":"A must stop if you are in Cleveland and boy was it worth it. Service was quick and I got to seat outside on a beautiful day. I started off with their flagship bear which was awesome! I then moved into the Periogi side as an appetizer, they are amazing! I've never had them before but wow. My main plate was the preztle crusted chicken it was awesome as well. The mashed potatoes was average but everything was great. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is the underside of my chicken was burnt and the server James was a bit slow."}
{"text":"The original brew pub of Cleveland for the past 20 years.  The one drawback to this popular pub, is that after paying to park across the street, you may not find an open seat at the bar, in which case you will most likely wait to be seated at a table, or just order your drink and find a place to stand.  Otherwise, I can't say enough about the quality of the beers.   Great food selection also, with many of the vegetables supplied from the West Side Market located directly across the street.  I especially enjoy the Veggie Pasta and a Dortmunder Gold at lunch time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"For a Saturday lunch, we were prepared for a wait. The hostess told us estimated 20-30 minutes so we grabbed a beer and headed out to the front patio to wait. We checked checked the app to see where our place was in line and it said 6 parties in front of us for around 30 min. Finally an hour later, we got a text saying our table was ready and waited another 15 minutes inside until they seated us. Once seated and a quick placement of order, we waited another 40 min until our food came our without a heads up from our waiter. I think if he had told us there would be a delay we would have been better prepared but sitting and waiting after already being there for an 1.5 hours we were a little frustrated. Finally, 2 hours after checking in, our food came out. My husband enjoyed his pirogies, but the hero sandwich I ordered was dry and the bread was so hard it was difficult to eat without scratching my mouth up. We tried to flag down our waiter to ask for some kind of condiment as we were not offered any and eventually resorted to asking our neighbor if we could borrow their mustard.  Seated next to restrooms and broken glass was on floor which my young son stepped on. Mentioned to waiters which they saw but was never cleaned up in the time we were there."}
{"text":"I called in a take-out order yesterday and was told it would be 15-20 min. I waited for over 30 minutes. When I got home, I realized that the veggie burger that I ordered looked more like a slider, it was as small as the lid on the salad dressing container! Also, there was nothing else in the bun, only the small patty. It was very dry and bland. I called to let the manager know, and heard back a few days later with an apology and a credit. I'm going to give it another try, but probably dine in!"}
{"text":"3/5 stars. I just can't find a good tasting beer here.  The old building style is cool, always packed and a long wait. Menu is different; but some good eats here.   Heads up: buying sample tastings separately is cheaper than a flight of beer."}
{"text":"I think that this place has been adequately reviewed, judging by the quantity and quality of the other reviews listed.  I'd just like to chime in that this is a great place to sample Great Lakes Brewing's brews right next to their origin.  It's a neat venue, with a lot of its own charm."}
{"text":"The food is so good the chicken with the pretzel  batter and the mash with it.. The nachos are so good and let's not forget the amazing beers. We will be back."}
{"text":"Beer was good. People were friendly. The downstairs was an awesome place out of an old speakeasy. A comedy show on tonight that want that funny, but I'm not going to put that on them. Food was good. Homemade tater tots were awesome!"}
{"text":"Alrighty... no excuses here.  I love craft beer, and have never been to Great Lakes until today.  Pathetic, I know.    I had high hopes - it is after all... GREAT LAKES - A CLEVELAND INSTITUTION!!!  Meh.    I ordered the Milk Stout.  Good tasting start, good mouth feel and texture, terrible, almost moldy aftertaste.  Certainly not even a fair milk stout.    The menu:  I am a sucker for fresh walleye and anything that mentions artichoke.  The catch of the day was walleye with sautéed  artichokes.  My friend and I also ordered the artichoke dip.  WOW!  Major joy-gasm of expectation!!!  Talk about high hopes!!!!  The crushing disappointment is still bitter on my lips. Sigh.  The dip was mostly a cheddar-y, cottage cheesy textured mess.  I could barely see or taste artichoke.  It actually was like a cheese sauce that curdled.  If that wasn't disappointing enough, it was cold in the middle, yet HOT on the outside.  Microwave much??  We returned it after a few bites.  The waiter was very nice about it, and took it off the bill.    On to my entrée.  Boy, I was hoping for the best...  First off, it was served on a pretentious plate.  You know the type - rectangular, lots of empty white space on either side... In a BAR.  Oy.  Then, I tried it.  Walleye was well prepared, but didn't seem \"market fresh\".  It was served over rice, which honestly tasted like instant.  Now for the artichoke.  CANNED.  I mean... CANNED.  If it was sautéed, I didn't notice.  It tasted like it had been in the can about 5 minutes before hitting the plate.  Served with broccoli that was clearly frozen.  A good quality frozen, and not over cooked, but still...  My meal also smacked of the microwave.  Piping hot plate, food way too hot for what was there.  In other words, every single thing on the plate was equally overheated.  Seems like the microwaves here get a lot of use.    Our server was very pleasant, very helpful.  Nice guy.  He made the experience bearable.  The ambiance of the place... very cool.  Inside and out, it was a place you'd think you'd LIKE to sit and have a few beers.  I think I'd like to take that ambiance, and move it to a place with outstanding beer and food.  I'll go back to Market Garden.  :)"}
{"text":"We loved Great Lakes BC-- loved all parts of Ohio City, actually. The location is great and you can see the famous \"bullet holes\" right as you enter the bar.  We sat downstairs at the bar and had a great time -- great service, interesting beers, tater tots that were HUGE, and wonderful pretzels as snacks.  GO. NOW."}
{"text":"Had the prosciutto grilled cheese and their year-round porter. The food and drink were good. I barely had to wait for my table. However, service left a lot to be desired. The server made no attempt to be friendly and barely checked on me. Given the server's total disinterest, I got my check ASAP rather than spend more time or money here. Good food and beer, pain to drive/park in the area, disappointing service."}
{"text":"Classic Cleveland craft beer and good food! Great Lakes Brewery makes some of the best beer in the area, and they have rotating seasonal beers that you can't buy except here at the restaurant/tap room. If you come for food, there's plenty of seating inside and outside. Lots of options for food! Your typical bar food that goes great with beer is the bratwurst. It's really flavorful, the kraut is the perfect palette cleanser, and the pierogies are wonderfully heavy. DO NOT get the ramen. It's honestly an insult Japanese food to call what they serve \"ramen,\" with overcooked noodles and a flavorless broth. If it wasn't for the good beer or the brats, this would've been rated a 2 or 3 star just based off of the ramen. You can also buy beers to take home here!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight strictly for Firkin Thursday. Firkin just means a small keg that has no \"air\" to push it out, such as Co2 or nitrogen. It is hand pumped, that's how it get's out of the keg. Amazingly smooth, creamy and tasty. Any type of beer can be made, but tonight was the Lake Erie Monster, double dry hopped IPA. IPA's are my favorite beer and this is one of the best. I really don't care much for Great lakes regular beers. The Lake Erie Monster, which is not a regular beer (why - ??? go figure,  never lasts very long), is really awesome. I am what would be called a \"hop head\", so this beer is not for everyone. If you like IPA's, this is absolutely one of the best. Congrats to Luke, the head brewer, for this beer."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing.  The sausage platter appetizer gave a great sample of the food.  The Cleveland sub was outstanding and the beers that paired with all of the food are outstanding.  Must try for dinner or lunch if in the area.  Staff is on their game and attentive."}
{"text":"I say go to Great Lakes for the beer because the food isnt that good.I ordered a half slab of ribs and they came out luke warm.I had the Holy Moses and its to me one of the best beer Great Lakes has to offer.I suggest sitting on the patio at night because nothing beats it and its very easy to strike up a conversation.I say give GLB a try but dont order the ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer, delicious food. The bar was beautiful and wood and from the 1870s. Take the tour then head to the brew-pup to soak up the beer. On the tour, $5 gets you 5 small pours."}
{"text":"This place makes it on the beer and atmosphere. Both are great. The food was just mediocre and service underwhelming.  Kind of place you would go to with a bunch of friends to kick back with."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing just does everything right. Their fleet of beers excite me for my annual pilgrimage and the catacombs and service keep me coming back. Their corporate culture and commitment to sustainability should be emulated by all other businesses.  The beers are usually excellent, especially the Lake Erie Monster, Blackout Stout, and Ladder 20. The only beer of theirs I don't like is the Doppelrock, which is good considering they make about 15 different beers throughout the year. The brewpub specials are always surprising.   The building that houses the brewpub is truly one of a kind that has an authentic feel to it. Nothing is better than enjoying an excellent beer in the catacombs. It just makes you feel special like drinking in a speak easy or a classic ratskeller in Germany. Just amazing.  The best part of GLBC is their efforts to promote sustainable business practices. From the installation of solar panels, the water reduction efforts in the pub, and my favorite, the recycling of cooking oil for the Fatty Wagon that you can take to Jacobs Field or Quicken Loans Area for a $1 round trip, they really set a great example to follow! A slogan on the coasters says \"Enjoy our beer and save the Earth\". Whenever says I've been drinking too much, I simply say \"I haven't drank too much, I simply care about the planet more than you do\". It makes my drinking habits justifiable!  I can't wait to go back to GLBC and I hope to for some time to come!"}
{"text":"I'm probably the only one, but I really do not like GLBC's beer. I wish I did - its everywhere and people all seem to enjoy it but I just can't get on board!   However - this place still rocks! Hands down the best brewery tour I have ever been on. They were so informative. I have several fun beer facts from this tour that I love to share.   The tour guides were fun and interactive. I love that this place funnels the beer straight to the restaurant - no kegs needed!  The great thing about this place is that it is always busy but it is so big (and cozy!) that you don't feel overcrowded.  Even being in a giant, packed restaurant - the food and the service is still outstanding. And the food is timely! Pretzel chicken, pot pie, beer battered fish & chips, all of it has been an A+  Unrelated to my experience, after learning all of the great things GLBC does as a company (See Luke T.'s results) - I want to force  myself to like their beer. Great place to always stop by after a morning at the market."}
{"text":"Hooray for Good Beer and So-So Food!  THE UP-SIDE: As has been mentioned, they brew great beer.  In addition, they have a pretty nice space with a pleasing atmosphere.  The servers are always friendly.    THE DOWN-SIDE: The food is just so-so; at times, downright greasy.  And please...  The beer is good but it's not the best in the country.  THE SUM-IT-UP: I firmly believe that this place would get great reviews from most people; solely based on the fact that they brew great beer.  However, when you step back from the beer angle, it's not so hot.  For all the hype, you think that they'd have a more decent menu."}
{"text":"I didn't know they had a basement area until recently. Went for a Friday lunch on a bitter cold day and the den with the bar and coziness down there was perfect. We had excellent service and the beer and food was great. I've been a couple times and always really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company is one of my favorite places for lunch and drinks. I took my wife, the better half, here on Friday afternoon for lunch and drinks. I opted to start the meal with a  Eliot Ness while my wife had a glass of wine, she is not a beer fan. We were greeted  and seated right away in the upstairs dining room, nice setup with various posters and signs from brewery long closed. The small bar setup in the corner was well done and I can see how this room could be a room to rent for a small party.   Well back to the food and beer, it is nice to see how many local vendors GLBC uses in there daily prep and production for lunch and dinner, the menu has a listing on vendor supply the restaurant. I started with the New England Clam Chowder., guessing it is impossible to source every last thing locally. The chowder is one of the best I've had in the CLE with some good seasoning that transformed a basic dish to something with actual taste.   My wife went with the butternut ravioli and I had the brat, perogies and red cabbage plate. The ravioli dish looked great and was given the two thumbs up by my wife. My bratwurst had a nice crisp char on the outside while cooked just right on the inside and. The perogies were plated with a nice golden color.  While easy to overlook the red cabbage was a great side that was cooked as best as I can describe as \"al dente\" with just enough firmness on the large pieces to give a great texture while being soft enough.   Last but it lest is the beer selection. My go to choice is the Dortmunder and or what ever is the seasonal pub handle when we visit.  There were a lot of good choices it I went the Eliot Ness, haven't had one in ages. Got to think that we must have looked like the odd couple out being that neither one of us had a Christmas Ale during the visit, I have enough in the fridge so don't judge."}
{"text":"Five Words:MACARONI AND CHEESE WITH BACON  One of the best meals I ever had..A five cheese Mac and Cheese with bacon and blue cheese..my husband ahd the same thing and neither of us could finish it..We took the leftovers home and let me just say it was better the second time around..  I have always loved the beers of the Great Lakes Brewing Company..When I was here with my husband I had the Edmund Fitzgerald and it paired well with the rich mac and cheese..My husband had the Christmas Ale and it also paired well with the food  Would I return?? For sure..Planning a return trip in the next couple fo weeks"}
{"text":"GLBC! Just some of the best beer! Not a huge fan of some of their ale's like the high striker, but the Chillwave is my favorite beer! Wish they had it out longer, but definitely look for it in march. The Christmas Ale is super good this year! Nosforatu was pretty good this year like it has been in the past. I can't wait for the Rye of the Tiger again either. Just so many good brews and there food is also delicious when you do eat at/near the brewery."}
{"text":"I like great lakes! Let me start by saying if you wish to do the beer tour, sign up early in the gift shop! As far as the tour goes, it's very basic and you only get one sample on the tour. Also Ohio state law requires great lakes to charge you for your sample so plan on having a quarter with.  They also serve food here and wow! Very good! The mac and cheese is solid but it's not the best I've ever had. I wish it was a little thicker on the cheese end if thingd, but none the less it was good. The Po' man sandwich however was awesome! Pieorgis, a bratwurst, sauerkraut  all on a local Cuban roll! Yum! Also the homemade tater tots, off the hook! They come stuffed with blue cheese and a cajun rub! These are a MUST try!  I'd definitely stop back here again! Mind you this is in a busy part of town. So avoid driving down 28th  street to get here and opted for 26th or so and find parking in this area!"}
{"text":"Edmund Fitzgerald is one of my all time favorite beers. Their beer is really good. Including their IPA.  Food is also enjoyable. This visit the lunch steak sandwich was dry. I wouldn't order it again. Service was also very slow today... Better service and food this would easily be a 4 star. All the beers I have had there are awesome!"}
{"text":"Brewery tour is fun to do. The basement/cave is cool to check out. Great beer list. Small food menu"}
{"text":"Full flight is fantastic! Needed to offer Rye of the Tiger, but I can wait."}
{"text":"Back when Great Lakes first opened, we were never really impressed with the food or service. I have to say our last few visits with friends have put Great Lakes back on in our restaurant rotation. We were seated almost immediately as a party of 3 for dinner on Saturday around 5pm. We were shocked. Being craft beer folks, we were happy to discover the brew pub exclusives only available there, which is also nice after tiring of their standard beers. The menu offerings made it really hard to decide, I landed with the pretzel chicken which was solid, tender & tasty. And now that Becca Ritterspach is creating their desserts, we will definitely be back! If you haven't been to Great Lakes in awhile, try it again. Very pleased with our experience!"}
{"text":"Great Lakes is a staple of Cleveland - and Ohio City. I've never had a beer I didn't like, and their beer-inspired menu is delicious.   There are several levels - including a basement pub - and even a patio in the summer.   I especially love the gift shop next door. It's a great place to pick up a six pack of something you've tried or a brewery souvenir."}
{"text":"Amazing beer. Knowledgable tour guide. However, wasn't incredibly impressed with dinner afterwards. Great spot for beer but I would go elsewhere for food!"}
{"text":"I don't know how they are still in business!? Besides the fact that they are a franchise and by over productivity from bs!!!! I can taste and feel that they are trying so hard to be great!  I am not god but a foodie and culinarian, I cook everyday and am very passionate about food, however.... Microwaveable meals don't impress me!!!"}
{"text":"Made a trip to Cleveland and this was to be our dinner stop. Definitely worth it. My wife had the pretzel chicken and I had the mac and cheese.  I was jealous of her dinner but mine was good also. I've had the Edmund Fitzgerald porter before so I knew how much I liked it and had it again. I think my only beef about this place was that the beer wasn't super cold. Maybe it's not supposed to be but that's my preference."}
{"text":"This review is for dining only. Came here on a VERY busy Friday night (9-10pm) and we were immediately seated despite this place being PACKED with people. I ordered a burger which came with seasoned fries (can't remember the name, I just remember there being two on the menu). I honestly went in not expecting the food to be anything amazing but boy was I shocked!  This is one of the best burgers I have ever had, and I have had a lot of burgers. It was juicy and the meat, although well done, was perfectly tender. It is fairly large, I couldn't finish the entire thing, but I wanted to so bad (I came close). The only thing I didn't like about it was how oily the bun was, I could barely hold onto it. Otherwise, it is the PERFECT burger.  Although waitresses were very busy, ours in particular was still interactive and did not forget about us. She checked on us a few times throughout the meal to make sure everything was okay, she was very pleasant.    Prices are very, very fair! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A must-stop when going 'home' to Northeast Ohio. The standards are always on tap and there is usually at least one interesting seasonal variety to tempt you out of your comfort zone. The food is quite good and emphasizes local produce, but space is tight in this popular spot, especially if the weather won't allow for the outdoor seating. Even if there's a wait, you can usually ask a bartender to be seated at one of the \"reserved\" tables in the bar. If you must wait, it's always a blast to go troll the West Side Market a half a block away to make the time fly by."}
{"text":"Great food great location awesome beer selection everyone is polite and eager to ease you from the min you walk in"}
{"text":"I had a great time here! Love the beer and have been drinking it for years now. Finally made it to the brewery! The food was good and the beer was tasty as always.  Not quite a 5 star, but a solid 4."}
{"text":"The beer is wonderful. I haven't tried one I didn't like here and trust me, I've had most of them - if not all of them. (Hey, I like to drink!)   The atmosphere in general is nice. I'm in love with the cellar (or whatever they call it) - I'm a sucker for stone walls.   I've had great service each time I've visited.  The food? I'd say it's mediocre which is why I'm giving GLBC 4 stars. Otherwise, I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"Over-priced & mediocre quality of food. Our party of three waited over an hour to be served two salads and a burger. The waiter never offered any explanation or apology for the delay. When we were finally served, he tried to pass it off by saying \"We took the extra time to make sure everything was carefully prepared.\" It would have been a nice line if we had been waiting 20 to 30 minutes, not over an hour."}
{"text":"Finally! I have been wanting to go to GLBC for a long time. Burning River is my standby. It's a solid IPA at a good price.   We had a slight snag when we arrived. We put our names in for a table of 8. I was told it would be 60-90 minute wait. We walked over to Market Fresh Brewery while we waited. 20 minutes later, I got a call that our table was ready. Uhhhh. She kind of gave me a hard time. We had just ordered our drinks and apps. There was no way we were going to get over there in 5 minutes. I asked her to bump us and she did. 45 minutes later, we got another call and this time we were ready!   We actually ordered dinner here. It was pretty good. Unfortunately, they were out of pretzel buns, so we had to settle for a regular bun. Womp womp. The burger was still delicious. Really good flavor and juicy. I couldn't eat another fry, so I ordered an herb salad with sweet potato vinaigrette. It was a very refreshing and tasty salad. It was a nice change from the last 3 orders of fries that people ordered earlier.   I was a little bummed that the draft list was pretty much everything they bottle. There was only 1 beer, Independence Ale, that isn't bottled or I haven't had. It was really good! Very much in line with the rest of their beer.   I can cross this off the list!"}
{"text":"Soooooo crowded. We were told there was a 2 hour wait or we could go downstairs and try to catch a table.  Downstairs was packed but my bf really wanted a Christmas Ale so we browsed around the gift shop and eventually decided to try the Cambodian restaurant around the block. By the time we got there and ordered a coffee, Great Lakes called us and told us our table was ready. So we went back and my bf had an opportunity to enjoy some good beer. I had high hopes about the food but it was mediocre at best. Way overpriced.  I'm not a beer drinker so I ordered a mixed drink, which was okay.  I'll try it again next time I'm in Cleveland on a less crowded day."}
{"text":"I live in Milwaukee so I don't get to visit Great Lakes often but I think it's awesome.  My dinner was delicious.  More importantly, the beer is outstanding with many options you can't find anywhere else.   The decor is fantastic and the bar is beautiful.  I also highly recommend the tour, very relaxed and informative.  I was very impressed with mixture of historical buildings and state of the art technology.  Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and full of interest details."}
{"text":"We went there while bar hopping. Ordered a beer and pretzel. Beer was good, however pretzel was average, slightly stale. Def good for beer and hanging out with friends"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.  From the staff to the food, to the brews.  Was just cruising through Cleveland on a road trip and everybody we met told us to go here.  Not disappointed.  Left here very full and slightly buzzed... Which was perfect for enjoying my friends horrendous driving."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe and great beer.  We got the pretzel appetizer and it wasn't as hot as I would've liked.  I also thought my butternut squash ravioli was kind of bland.  But others in my party loved their food.  I tasted a tater tot and it was the best I'd ever had!  They are really big.  We also had nachos, which were excellent.  Really the only downside is that they don't take reservations or call ahead seating on the weekends.  We went at 6:20 on a Saturday night and waited about an hour for a table."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for lunch during a weekday.  We were promptly seated in the patio-ish area on the east side of the restaurant.  I could already tell from just being seated this would be a cool experience.  The roof in this part of the restaurant is retractable, which is quite unique.  Great Lakes Brewing, as you probably know, is highly regarded for their brews.  Coming here not to drink, but to simply eat, I can tell you that the food is great.  I had the vegan burger (one of the few vegeterian options) was excellent.  What was best about the meal though were the fires that came with the burger: Nicely salted, perfectly fried and simply delicious.    I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 for a couple reasons.  First, the food is slightly expensive for the portion sizes served.  Second, parking here absolutely sucks.  Perhaps that isn't the fault of the restaurant, but I hate driving a long distance to go eat somewhere but spending just as much time trying to park the damn car as I did to drive to the location.  Frustrating.  I'll be back though."}
{"text":"Finally visited GLBC! It was *packed* on the particular night of our visit, and there was an exceptional wait, but it was worth it!  The interior was reminiscent of a local joint which made it feel \"homey\" and the experience was everything that I had hoped for. We sampled fresh pours of Nosferatu, Dortmunder Gold, Edmund Fitz and others that escape me and had an excellent meal to boot. I've been dying to try their beers from a fresh tap, and they did not disappoint.  Service was a little slow, but given the fact that we waited almost 90 minutes to get in and the place was at (over) capacity, it was acceptable. I would prefer to visit on an off peak time/day, but I will not mark down the service as our server was 1) attentive 2) accurate and 3) efficient despite the throng of people that visited this night.  I don't know when my next trip to Cleveland will be, but I'll defiantly stop back at GLBC!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try some the beers and have dinner at the bar. There were two people sitting at the bar and I. Bartender was pour beers for the waiters and waitresses to deliver. Not unusual. Couple of guys showed up and she poured their beers. I was patient and started timing how long it was going to take for me to get a beer. Long story short, after 15 minutes of waiting I left and went across the street to Market Brewery and had a great sandwich and beer."}
{"text":"We went here this afternoon after going to the Westside Market. We stopped in just to grab some beer to take back with us fresh from the brewery, but decided to stay for a bit after seeing how charming and friendly everyone was...not to mention seeing the food coming out of the kitchen.  We took a stroll down stairs and had some fresh beer and were served by a very friendly bartender who was extremely knowledgeable. Afterwards we picked up some beer at the inside gift store. Which the staff there was also extremely helpful and knowledgeable on all the products. We will definitely be returning and it's worth experiencing if in the area, then taking some home with you too!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The tater tots were awesome.  the grilled cheese with fig jelly was deliciGREAT and pulled pork was so tasty! FRENCH FRIES WERE THE BEST! Decadent bread pudding. Original beers only available here. Great service."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the calamari, kielbasa with perogi and pretzel chicken. I was a little disappointed by the beer but I will be thinking about the food tomorrow. Yum!"}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes for a table with at least 10 open.  Management appears to care less about the dining customer"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience! Such a fun atmosphere and a great place to go after work with friends.   Everyone knows about the famous Christmas Ale, but Great Lakes has so many great seasonal and staple ales that you can always find something delicious to try.   This was a favorite of mine when I was in college and continues to be a favorite even today.   One of my favorites in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"I've been drinking GLBC for years and finally made it up here. Started our trip off with a pretzel and cheese sauce. I prefer my cheese a little thicker, but still good flavors and a hint of blue cheese. I then had a Cleveland Hero sandwhich, which was also super yummy. Most of their food ingredients come from local suppliers at the West Side Market, also a great stop while you're here. Then, the beer. Couldn't leave without a Christmas Ale and also had a taproom exclusive raspberry wit. Both fantastic. Tip: wanna find easy parking? Go on a Tuesday or Thursday when the market isn't open."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I'm sort of a fan of their beer...Chillwave is one of my top 10 beers, in fact. The food was just ok. It was bar food. I was hoping they would have a more imaginative menu, like most breweries. I get it, it's an Irish brew pub vibe. I was also surprised by the limited tap list. It's a must stop for a beer nerd but it misses the mark a little."}
{"text":"My group really enjoyed our meal here at Great Lakes.  We sat on their patio which was a bit brighter than sitting inside their pub area.  Food was standard brew pub standards so I went with their sausage platter and their charcuterie/cheese plate.  Some of the sausages were spicy as in above medium so make sure to ask what they are serving on the sausage plate if you have a sensitivity to spice.  Otherwise all meats and cheese were delicious.    I only had the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and it was so good that i ordered another one and got the T-shirt at the neighboring store.  It was a nice smooth and not too heavy dark beer.  Service went well and other than waiting about 30 minutes for our food, everything went okay.  That staircase going to their basement bathroom was pretty narrow and not very well illuminated so make sure to grab the rails on your way up and down."}
{"text":"Great Lakes is a really fun spot for a casual dinner. The beers...obviously...are awesome! There's a lot of selection and it's always nice to drink local. I've only ever had the burgers but they're just what burgers should be. I mean, who can go wrong with burgers and beers. Going in the summer is my favourite because you can sit on the huge patio. Now that the weather's nicer I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great place for some really nice quality beer. The company brew their own and on Thursdays, they have a special brew they make that you can try. I went here with a friend after another Yelper recommended I go check out. It's in Ohio City and the day we went, it was rainy but people still made it out. The \"special brew\" they had was unique. It had chocolate and coffee beans with plenty of hops. Something I haven't had before and in my opinion, a good different. When you walk in, you want to walk downstairs to the cellar, that's where you want to ask for the special brew. On Thursdays, they have people come who are part of the craft brew club I believe. But overall, it's like a dive bar but comfortable. Service wasn't too bad and the prices are reasonable.   Upstairs is another bar area with lots of space. I spent most of my time downstairs but heard from a couple of people that the place make some really good food too so I may have to come back and try."}
{"text":"Sucker.   That is what I have become as of late when my after work plans of working out are squashed by co-workers going to GLBC. \"It might be the last night patio day...\" \"But they might run out of Pumpkin Ale (my weakness) this week...\" \"Woohoo Christmas Ale-we need to have our first of the year...\" Do you see where I'm going with this? Also I've hit a few key menu items I love so I have decided to finally share.  Beer: There are the staples and there are the every changing Pub Exclusives along with the Seasonal Beers. You really can't go wrong. This fall the beers I will be waiting for next year are the Glockenspiel and I'm in love with their Pumpkin Ale. Obviously Christmas Ale is tasty in the winter and the smell outside the brewery is amazing when they are brewing. Edmund Fitz, Imperial Dort, Holy Moses White Ale, Blackout Stout are also delicious. Every bartender I have had a conversation with has been able to find one that suits my beer taste and needs. Love them! Look for Lee/Leigh (sp)...she is awesome.  Food:   STARTERS: Stilton Cheddar Ale Soup. So good! Made with Dortmunder Gold. Looking for an app the Brewer's Barley Pretzels are filling and big enough for the whole table. Salads are salads...but I love how they want to marry the menu selection with a beer selection that will compliment like any great relationship...  MEAL STUFF:  Pizza-go for the Italian Market-soooo good!!! My co-workers also love the Sausage Pizza. Friends have loved the burger and I wouldn't mind trying their Housemade Vegan Burger in the future.   ENTREES:  Brat & Pierogi (mmmmm). The Butternut Squash Ravioli is sooo good and made locally. Mac & Cheese can't go wrong. And best for last...tho this randomly changes day to day...Pretzel Chicken. Encrusted with pretzel served with mashers and veggies and the Burning River Pale Ale mustard. Served 1 chicken or 2. Box the 2nd for lunch the next day-you will be happy you did!  Long I know.  Summers = Patio Winters = Basement All year = A great Happy Hour, after West Side Market drink, dinner or Trivia Night (tuesdays in the basement)  Have fun. Eat. Drink. Be Merry!"}
{"text":"The beer has gone down hill, as so many brew pubs do after they gain success. The food was overpriced, and underwhelming. Most of the people in my group felt the same way."}
{"text":"So yummy. The burger was one of the best I have ever ate and there were so many selections of beer. Loved the Christmas mix"}
{"text":"Great Lakes has always been a \"must do\" on my summer list of places to go, before the Tribe game. The meat and cheese platter was as good as always. But the chicken sandwich came out and it was raw!!! The place was packed and I'm sure the kitchen was busy, but not an excuse. I'm  giving it a 3 instead of a 1 because the service was good and the beer was phenom."}
{"text":"Great spot. Be warned that it's almost always busy but it is well worth the wait. Food, drinks and servers are very nice and easy going. Can be a little pricey but when it comes down to it, I always leave happy and wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place last summer. To say the least, I will not return. I had ordered a stew served over a puff pastry. There might have been one piece of meat in the stew...it was really just gravy served over the pastry. I asked to speak to the manager....nicely of course. It wasn't the server's fault that the food was terrible. The manager handled this poorly and when I had said I wasn't likely to return I was charged for my lunch...really? In addition, the beer is not all that good. Try Fathead Brewery...so much better!"}
{"text":"I love Great Lakes beer but you can get it at restaurants in Cleveland with much better food In an area of town with a lot of food competition Great Lakes does not hold their own Mosly basic options nothing stands out I've tried dinner and apps nothing was memorable or even enjoyable  Come for the Christmas Ale but eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great experience! The beer was awesome - I had two of the pub-only selections. Rye of the tiger and a red beer (I forget the name). We waited at the downstairs pub for our table and the bartender downstairs was super nice even when we kept closing the tab but deciding to order more.  We were seated in the area near the store. The only gripe is that the table was tiny and there wasn't enough room between you and the tables on the other side (booths). As for the food, everything was good. I ordered the spinach, mushroom and brie pizza. It was great! Perfect size for one person (although it could have been shared, I had leftovers). Other orders at the table were a burger (don't know which one), perogies, and fish and chips. I have to comment that the tartar sauce was addictive.  The service was awesome as well.   In the store, I wish they sold non-chilled beer especially if you want to take it back with you."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the beer selection and the mac and cheese was very good. They have some of my favorite beer, currently enjoying the triple dog dare. Cute outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"The food is really hit and miss.  I am not a beer drinker, so no comment on that.  When it is good, it is really good, but that isn't all the time."}
{"text":"Worked near this Cleveland staple for a summer. While there are better restaurants in Cleveland, for a brewery the food is aces. I've had the pretzel, the burger, and the brown butter squash ravioli and they were all delicious. The service was great and you are always guaranteed a great beer with your meal. The outdoor seating is a little cramped, but other than that it's a great spot to grab some noms and a beer."}
{"text":"On a high recommendation from a friend I decided to go to Great Lakes Brewing Company. I am glad that I took his advice. The beers were excellent! My favorite one was Eliot Ness. I enjoyed the meat and cheese plate as an appetizer and had the Pretzel chicken for dinner. My server was very friendly and helped me with my beer selections. There is lots of outside seating if you want to enjoy the weather while it is nice."}
{"text":"MY 3 STARS IS NOT IN REGARDS TO THE BEER, JUST THE FOOD   Just felt I needed to get that out of the way! Hey the beer it speaks for itself and is easily a five out of five brewery. Weather bought there or elsewhere I always enjoy Great Lakes Brewing Company Beer.   As for the food I felt it was slightly overpriced given what they serve and I also felt the portions certainly left something to be desired. The food is not bad don't get me wrong I just think in the future I will get dinner elsewhere then have a drink here."}
{"text":"al capone couldn't get him; kevin costner tried (fortunately, the untouchables was pre-waterworld); but rumor has it elliot ness almost bought the farm at the great lakes brewing company.  the bar is one of cleveland's oldest and, in a former life, was called the taproom.  the taproom was frequented by ness, post-capone, and the bullet holes in the bar were shots allegedly aimed at, or fired by, ness.  but, enough history, on to the beer.  the dortmunder gold is one of the best lagers i've ever had.  hands down.  they do a very good job with all of their beers but, if i had to select just one, it would be the dortmunder.  the elliot ness amber, burning river pale and edmund fitzgerald porter are also all solid choices.    if you happen to go in, god and your liver willing, i'd recommend you try them all.  the christmas ale is definitely the best of their seasonals.  you wouldn't think a cinnamonny-nutmeggy beer would be that good, but it is.  i actually think it would be excellent served warm, but, apparently, that's just me.  i've never eaten here, so i can tell you squat about the food.  but the beer . . . oh, the beer."}
{"text":"Christmas ale. They are well known for it. The food was nice, think HOPS restaurant and brewery, except the beer is better. And I love the old bar feel too. Definite do-over when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"This place epitomizes the craft brew movement. They have great beer year round but just wait until Christmas ale gets released and this place is packed! In the past year or so, they have added upstairs seating and some seating on the side of their main bar so they can now accommodate many more people. It used to be hard to get a table.  The food, like any good brewery, is great. They have unique dishes and a pretty good selection. I would try more of their food but I really can't get past the pretzel chicken. Big juicy chicken breasts with a ground up pretzel crust that makes it a prefect dish. They also have good pizzas and a happy hour, which I have been to on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"Very fun location. Beers are all good.  The session IPA and the oatmeal stout were my personal favorites. I recommend that you get a flight in order to sample the entire current selection.  The food is very good as well the meatloaf plate was my favorite. The pierogis are amazing.  The only reason I didn't give out 5 stars was the steak I had was just a bit tough but the overall experience was very positive.  If I'm back in Cleveland I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had lunch at the Great Lakes Brewing Company before heading to the airport on a Saturday - the wait for a table  (for 2) around 2 pm was 40+ minutes and getting a beer while we waited would've been great... but the bartenders couldn't be bothered.   Overall, food was tasty but nothing to write home about.  Still love the beer - had the Elliott Ness, the Grand Cru, and Dortmunder Gold.  Dessert was probably the highlight of the meal - bread pudding with a whiskey butter sauce."}
{"text":"Love the Great Lakes brewing company beer.  Great place to go for lunch after going to the Market."}
{"text":"Great Lakes is such a cool , casual spot to take a friend. I love eating in the basement-- but seating is limited. The stone work is beautiful down there. The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say out of this world but  would consider it quality \"bar food.\" Definitely not a place I would go to if I were a vegetarian-- the sausage is good, yummy appetizers and I love the soft pretzels! I think I remember getting pierogies that I highly enjoyed as well.   Obviously a good beer selection and location! Sitting outside in the Summer is nice as well but be sure  to make a reservation!   I gave it 4 stars because while the food is good, I have never been blown away by it."}
{"text":"The food and beer was amazing! I ordered the sampler so I was able to try all 11 beers that were on tap and I liked them all! We ordered a pizza, which was huge, and it was crispy and full of toppings and flavor. The atmosphere is awesome here. Make sure to visit the basement bar when you are there."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go and relax and converse with friends. The brew, on the other hand is a little less to be desired. I'm all for supporting local companies but it's really hard when it comes to taste buds. But I'd go here simply for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Decor: 5 Ambiance: 5 Service: 4 Value: 5  The food was slightly short of great, but the star here is clearly the beer. I tried 8 of their offerings, and all were amazing. Great Lakes Brewing definitely didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We just came in for a pre-dinner drink on Friday; bar table was not too hard to grab, but getting served took a bit of time. Beer was fresh and tasted great. $5 pints."}
{"text":"Been a big fan of their beer for a long time and was excited to visit their brewery. Their gift shop is cute. There sell prints of their beer labels which look cool.  I split an order of lamb chops and butternut squash ravioli with my date. The lamb chops were excellent and worth the splurge. The ravioli unfortunately was so salted my lips burned while trying to eat it. Neither my date or I could finish them.  Everything else about the place is lovely and I wish I could give 5 stars.  I'm hoping we just got a bad dish and the ravioli isn't supposed to taste that way."}
{"text":"I took the tour and had a few drinks at the bar next door. Tim, our tour guide, was excellent. He had a great mix of beer knowledge, Cleveland history, and humor. This was a great value and I would recommend it to anyone in the Cleveland area. Great job Tim!"}
{"text":"Had a sampler of all the beer, which is great for lively discussion and gift recommendations. The beer cheese soup is amazing, as is the bread pudding and the edmund Fitz ice cream. Always busy, but they have been continuously expanding to keep up with the growth. A classic Cleveland experience. The fun energy on the date of a new release is infectious to the whole neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fast and diligent service.  Truly enjoyed the flight of beers.  Food was excellent.  A bit on the pricey side (not a complaint, just an observation).  Will definitely return for another go!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! Excellent beer great food. Only draw back the server was rude and had major attitude!!! The beer made up for it."}
{"text":"Great brewery second time coming through Cleveland and had to stop here for the beer and brewery food. Always enjoy and good selection of beers to drink. Will be back :-)"}
{"text":"The beer is (obviously) awesome. The food is just kinda- meh. There are so many really good places around I feel like this place is hard to compete.   They don't have a ton of really original options, and everything we got was just pretty good. My boyfriend ordered perogies, kielbasa, and sauerkraut and it was AWFUL. Not to mention it came out plated very uh-- phallicy. No way it wasn't intentional, but we have a sense of humor lol. The service was decent. We will likely come back only to drink a few at the bar, and head somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Crowded for a Tuesday at 2 p.m.....I guess I shouldn't be surprised as this Brewery has an excellent reputation for great craft beer and it is the holiday break.   We were told 30 to 50 minute wait but due to a \"no show\" our party of 6 was seated in under 10. Although I would have preferred the pub, beggars can't be choseres, so sitting in the enclosed patio was just fine.  Service came quick and was friendly.  I had not had their Abbey Ave. Double....and it did not disappoint. Really quite good. Dad liked the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter as well  Started with soup. Mom liked the cream of broccoli and I LOVED the cheese soup. Outstanding!  Everyone like their meals and I know my meatloaf sandwich was quite good. Although I think I would have like a beef meatloaf more than the turkey they served.  Overall a very good lunch."}
{"text":"Got seated upstairs immediately even though it was a little before 8 on a Friday night.  I have no complaints. The beer was good. The chicken pot pie (not my usual thing) and the pretzel chicken were really good and reasonably priced.   Service was good. Plain room upstairs made better by trees blooming outside and lights laced across the street.  Just hope GLB doesn't rest on it's laurels."}
{"text":"Wow! Just had my first experience at the brewery last night and I must say I am so impressed! I went there mainly because of the Christmas Ale (which was fantastic as per usual), but I was equally satisfied with the food. Our server was so nice! The food came out VERY QUICK! My friends got the ravioli which looked just as beautiful as it tasted. \"It looked so nice I didn't want to eat it...until I tried it and I couldn't stop!\" I had the vegan burger which I really enjoyed because you could tell it was homemade and cooked as a vegan burger, not as a regular burger. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better I bit into the fries that came with it and I had an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I had to share with everyone at the table. They were too good to keep to myself! We also went on the tour of the brewery afterwards which was fascinating. I highly recommend taking the tour through the facility and getting some beer samples at the end. What a great way to spend the day! Next time I am in town I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food! We had a appie plate of local meats, cheeses, and house made hummus & olives. Beet salad was tasty. The cheddar cheese soup was wonderful, very rich and flavorful. I loved the pretzel-coated chicken breast. Nice server, good beer, and delish grub!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the beer, not the food (the food is 'fine', that's about all you can say--you don't come for the food).  These guys brew *amazing* beer.  The Dortmunder Gold is perhaps one of the best beers in existence--anywhere.  And it's not just Clevelanders that say so.  Almost always crowded Thurs-Sat and for good reason. You can pick up the beer at Heinen's or many other local grocery stores."}
{"text":"Really great flights of beer. 5 ounces of beer for $1.50 each. Nice happy hour menu. But the pretzel bites are very very salty. I think it's the cheese dip. Too much. Really beautiful bar very old carved wooden bar area."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the greatest places in CLE.  The beer of this location has an exclusive brew not available outside of the building.  Rackhouse Ale, keep making this.  We went often with the project team to come to this location.    Food is just as good as the beer.  Definitely try the Pretzel Chicken [ffffing amazing] and the Fish and chips were so good.  Not lazy made but clearly good.  They also have this stuffed pork chop that was better than I've had at most.  But definitely try the Pretzel Chicken [I'm writing this review 2 weeks after I've last been there and i'm still thinking about it]."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company is one of my favorite places in the world. Five stars all the way. My first visit to GLBC was a cold January night in 2003, and I've had tons of great times here ever since. GLBC's beers rank high in my book. One of my top craft brewers in the country. GLBC basically rules in every way. The food is awesome. Service is fantastic. And the Ohio City vibe is simply perfect. Eventually, once the Ohio City craft beer boom is done, GLBC will be the only one still standing. They're just that good. Cleveland is jammin' lately, but GLBC has been dope for decades. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"A true hit or miss experience on all accounts.  As long as I have lived in Ohio City I have heard the hype around Great Lakes Brewing Company. The first few times I went to the restaurant it was just downright bad. They had run out of half the menu and the service was bad. Now that I have been a few more times I realize this is not a constant. I have had really awesome experiences and really bad ones. There have been times the food has been oh so yummy while you could hardly get the attention of the server for another beer. Other times of greasy or otherwise unsavory food with good service. Still other times both service and food have been lacking.  In general the space is nice and cozy. A nice pub atmosphere. The ingredients they use are very high quality and locally obtained when possible and they are a green company that tries to reduce their waste wherever they can which are both admirable attributes. The beer list offers something yummy for everyone from the light pale ales to the dark porters and stouts. The beer is the only aspect of the dining experience at the brewery which has been of constant quality.  What I recommend: Cheddar Stilton beer soup Any of the burgers Portobella mushroom sandwich Salads The pretzels Edmund Fitzgerald Porter (and the chocolate chunk ice cream) Elliot Ness Lager Conway's Irish Ale  Hit or miss Pizzas Pretzel Chicken (sometimes it is way too greasy) Pasta (daily concoctions sometimes leave something to be desired)  Avoid: Irish Stew (reminded me of baby food) Any dish with rice (the rice is never properly cooked)  Overall: Try at your own risk. If you get a skinny female server with glasses just run."}
{"text":"I've seen some of Great Lakes brews on tap in both Cleveland and western Pennsylvania.  After I visited the West Side Market I got hungry, and realized the brewery was just around the corner, so it seemed like a good place to get some lunch.  I was by myself, and both the hostess and server were gracious and didn't make me feel awkward, which is always a plus.  The patio is great, with a nice fountain and plenty of shade.  My server had really helpful beer recommendations, and steered me toward a great IPA (the Session IPA-- very drinkable).  For food, I ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was one large piece which was a little tricky to eat, but the beer batter was great and the fish was flaky and delicious.  The cole slaw was all right, but the best part was the fries-- they're the thick-cut pub-style and covered in sea salt or parmesan or crack or something, but they were some of the best fries I've ever had.  I didn't go on the tour, although it seemed like a nice space (after living in Colorado I've been on my fair share of brewery tours), but I'd love to try more of the beers sometime when I'm not driving, and I'd definitely consider a repeat visit next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First time stopping in.  Got the Pretzel Chicken and the Nasfuratu Imperial Red Ale.  Beer was decent, and the chicken was--well, decent.  Honestly I was a little underwhelmed and dissapointed. It came out along with my fiance's pizza within 6-7 minutes of ordering which seemed suspect.  When I took my first bite, it was lukewarm at best.  Im sorry but I have a thing with chicken: it better have steam bellowing from it when I make that first cut.  It was not undercooked, but had been clearly cooked and put under a heat lamp long before it got to me.  The sauce was phenomenal though.  Since there aren't half stars I rounded up from a 3.5 simply because I do love their beers and that sauce was out of this world.  I will be back to see if this was just an off night for the short order cooks in the back."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland must include a stop at this place.  We were getting ready to eat on the patio and it started to rain.   They quickly moved us inside and even with a change in servers, they didn't miss a beat.   The beer is delicious and they have pub only styles available.  The food was good and the tater tots....you'll have to order them to find out how good they are.  I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Who does not love this place, they continue to build on the brand and grow! When people ask what should i do or try when in Cleveland I always say, Great Lakes Brewing Company! Great beer, by passionate people, giving back to the community!"}
{"text":"Came here during Oktoberfest so it was a little crazy, but fun! The place was packed, and they had live music. We took the brewery tour (its free) which was fun. You do need to bring some quarters for samples, as I guess they cannot legally give you free beer.  We also sat inside for a little bit and we got pretzels and the sausage plate. Both were really good. I would highly recommend a stop. They have lots of great beer and its always better on draft! They do also have a large outdoor patio for warmer days!  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the staff. Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad. But they weren't that great either, you could tell they were just there to do their job and leave. I didn't feel a sense of great customer service, they were just mediocre."}
{"text":"GREAT beer, way over packed upstairs and downstairs. Scotch ale was A+, tried one of their porters and it was excellent as well."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Cleveland area and were drawn here from the reviews. Bathe area is great!  We found street parking a ton less than some of the lots were charging.  The people waiting around can be intimidating and make you think there is a wait.  We got right in though.  I am not sure what everyone was standing around for.  We started off with the local plate which was honestly the best thing we have eaten in a very long time!   My kids split the fish and chips which they really liked.  I had the pear salad which was good but not fantastic.  I ended up wishing I order something else for the price I paid.  My husband order a burger.  The beers were great.  We both ordered one each and then split a 12 flight.   Service was fantastic.  It is worth a visit and you must get the local plate.  I walked by someone with some sort of a sausage plate.  I am a vegetarian but it made me wish I ate meat when I saw the presentation."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium burger no bun and sweet potato fries.  Very disappointing.  Fries were cold and stuck together...greesy almost as well and the burger had no juice, moisture...anything.  I could have used the burger as a sponge it was so dry.    I won't give them 1 star cause the christmas ale is legendary and evil good...but the food has sunk!"}
{"text":"Freezing cold basement. Ordered a jack and coke which was disgusting. If I drink alcohol 90% of the time it's a jack and coke. I know my jack and I know aged whiskey. I tried to send it back and told the bartender it was stale and the coke was flat. She argued with me and insisted I order it again with more coke. So she could charge me and water it down. If a customer tells you repeatedly that they don't want something- let it go. Customer is always right. And I know my whiskey. Sorry honey, you won't win this argument."}
{"text":"The Beer (* * * *)  I don't remember exactly when it was that I discovered craft beer. It was probably sometime back in the mid-90s while I was a drunk, er, student at Ohio University. It was probably between pitchers of Killian's Irish Red at Wings and Rings or dollar Stroh's at Night Court. Whenever it was doesn't really matter. Sure, Sam Adam's might have been my first, awkward, sweaty and nervous, but Great Lakes Brewing Company's Dortmunder Gold was the one that really counted. To this day it's one of the few beers that I actually crave.  I love GLBC. They are a Cleveland icon and a craft brewing staple in our region. It's hard to wander into a bar in Cleveland without finding at least one GLBC beer on tap - they're now distributed in 14 states. They have a well-crafted, award-winning, concise portfolio (5 year-rounds and 9 seasonals), they made it into the top 50 of the latest Zymurgy reader's poll with Edmund Fitzgerald porter, and, according to the latest rankings put out by the Brewer's Association every year, they're #18 in the nation by sales volume. Not bad for a little brewery that started back in 1988, while craft brewing was just a twinkle in our nation's eye.  Just so it's not all gooey sappy love song here, there are a couple things about GLBC that irk me.   1. Where's the innovation? When was the last time GLBC had a new year-round release? I'm not asking you to be at the level of a Dogfish Head or Rogue, but c'mon. You can only rest on your laurels for so long.  2. Why the race to ooze all over the country? Let's not get so big that we have to start neglecting the homebase in the name of growth. Large ships aren't as agile.  3. I don't get the fascination with the Christmas Ale, people. Sure, it's a good beer, but there are many more holiday seasonals that I think are equally as good or better. And now we have to start seeing it in July? Ugh.  The restaurant (* * *)  I've visited GLBC's restaurant a handful of times over the years and I've never had a bad experience. I'm not saying you'll get 5-star treatment here, but you won't be disappointed either. Sure, I don't tend to patronize such establishments during their busiest times (stay away on the weekends unless you like to wait and/or scream at your dining partners to be heard) and this could skew my review for you weekenders who enjoy being around people, but when I have been there I've enjoyed myself. The service is typical Cleveland, not overly friendly, a bit on the long side - I've had several lengthy waits between pint-fillings - and rarely wrong.  The food, at least the dishes I've had, is filling, fatty and plays well with the beer. Speaking of the food, the menu at GLBC's brewpub, peppered with thoughtful beer pairing recommendations,  is a collection of old faithfuls like salads, burgers, and sandwiches and as well as some unique additions like the Dortmunder cheese soup (I could bathe in this stuff) and a pretzel encrusted chicken entrée served with Burning River pale ale mustard sauce. Did I mention that you can also get your mandibular mitts on plenty of Cleveland staples like sausages, brats, and pierogi? Oh yeah, and the soft pretzels? Carbolicious.  Like most first loves, there will probably always be a small place of my heart that belongs to Great Lakes Brewing Company. They have established themselves as a Cleveland institution and garnered a permanent place in the heart's of Clevelanders the world over. They've also managed to carve out a niche with the one of the regions first and most successful brewpubs. The food is fresh, filled with local love and designed to complement the reason GLBC exists, the beer. It's got its warts, but sometimes I tend to overlook them for some reason..."}
{"text":"$15 is the cheapest I've paid for a flight like that!  We didn't try any food, but decided to try a flight since we couldn't decide which beer to order.  (I think a flight is equivalent to about 3 pints of beer which for me was perfect to share with a friend)  They let you try one of everything (see pic).  My favorite was the Christmas ale.  I can't believe they don't rename it something else so that they can sell it all year.   Upstairs was packed so we ventured to the bar downstairs and were pleasantly surprised by a warm, cozy, laid back atmosphere with ample televisions.  All the bartenders were great!  This was great escape from the cold outside and a pleasant way to spend a couple hours on a Saturday afternoon.    I'll be back!"}
{"text":"GLBC is one of my favorite places in Ohio City. You have to know in advance that the brewpub serves a different role than some of the other bars on the street. It's more of a happy hour place than a late night place. It's more of a sit-down and eat place than a stand around and drink place.  The food is decent - a tad pricey by Cleveland standards; but I typically don't come here to eat anyway.  The beers on tap are top-notch. Obviously, they are all Great Lakes beers, and they are extremely fresh and delicious. They have new seasonal the day they come out, they will never run out of Christmas Ale in the winter, and the pub-exclusives are usually worth a try.  In the winter my favorite room is downstairs in the beer cellar. During the summer the patio out front is the place to be. Beer prices are very reasonable, even better during happy hour. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, go on the brewery tour - it's worth seeing at least once (and there are samples)."}
{"text":"This place is great. We were there on a weekday for lunch and the longer we were there the more packed it got - so not only is this a possible beer tourist stop, but a local lunch spot. The outdoor seating area is wonderful on a good weather day.  Our service was great and very helpful with picking perfect beer. If it's your first time try the beer sampler - it's a good deal and you get to try a great variety."}
{"text":"The area is on the rise and wife, kids and I really enjoyed like the vibe of the area the brewpub is located.  Seemed to be plenty of parking at meters.  The building is old and has a lot of character, but with age, some of it needs repair.  The bathrooms were both very poor for a restaurant.  We should have sat outside as the inside was just very dark and dungeony.  We ordered the session IPA, Imperial Red and Alberta Porter.  All were very good, nothing extra ordinary, but good.  So far four out of five stars.  Then came the food.  The kid's both got their version of \"mac and cheese\" which utilized a wheat pasta that neither kid liked and when I tasted, it tasted like wheat bread with some cheese.  Was very dry.  Serving size however was better than average, but no point in having a huge portion size if neither kid likes the pasta.  Both my wife and I ordered the burger which was  average in taste, however the serving size is probably the smallest I have seen from any brewpub I have visited.  Poor value of the higher than average cost.  French fries however were good.  Service was good and kudo's to the hosting staff as they were very welcoming and cheerful.  Glad we visited, but I am sure there are better brewpubs in the area."}
{"text":"I got their special tots and a prosciutto grilled cheese with clam chowder. Well the clam chowder had bacon in it, I wish I knew I hate bacon so I didn't eat it. There was hardly ANY prosciutto in my grilled cheese and the bread was really hard. But the tots were good. I paid 2.00 extra to sub the tots. I got 3 tots. Which were a little bigger than the standard tot.my boyfriend got a burger that he ate half of because he said it was super dry and the pretzel bun was very hard, although he is a bacon lover and enjoyed the clam chowder. I would rather eat somewhere else downtown. Won't be coming back here for food. Not to mention my heafty bill. Paid over 50$ for a disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"I didn't know that Great Lakes was based in Cleveland, so I needed to go there once I realized it was in town. So happy that I did. They have numerous beers here that they don't sell elsewhere that were quite tasty. They sell them in multiple sizes, including 5-oz tasting glasses, so that you can get a number of them. It can be a whole activity.  I had the beet salad and the beer cheese soup. Let me first say that I love beer cheese soup, and this soup did not disappoint! It was like a bowl of melted cheese with just enough beer to taste and to fix the consistency of what would otherwise be basically queso. A win on that front. I did briefly wonder what percent of my daily saturated fat I was consuming but I banished this thought to the weekend.  The beet salad was also very good. It is one of their smaller salads, and to my mind it was not an appropriate size to serve as a full meal. The beets were cooked and dressed perfectly on some greens, with a good level of sweetness balanced by a vinegar-oil dressing. Excellent mix of flavors, well executed.  I had been hoping to get creme brulee, but they had actually taken it off the menu. It's still on the menu on their website, but don't be fooled! They do have desserts here, including the best rated bread pudding in Cleveland (or so they say). I didn't try it out because it does have raisins in it (be warned), but I can't say I wasn't tempted.  The dinner wasn't a steal, but I would definitely go back - it was worth every penny. We sat outside on the patio area, which was protected from the elements and also much quieter than the indoor seating area. Four stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to hangout or have dinner when I'm in Cleveland. I cannot recommend a better place to eat and have drinks in the entire state of Ohio, this place is awesome! This brewery is famous for brewing outstanding beer. All beer is brewed on location and is so fresh it cant be beat. As for the food, all of their ingredients are locally grown and/or bought. They get a lot of stuff from West Side Market which is right across the street so, you know anything you order there is fresh and delicious.  Personally, i usually get the 'Old World Cheeseburger' and wash it down with an 'Edmund Fitzgarald' (maybe the greatest beer in the world) but, they have a great menu its not just bar food it's a 5 star restaurant at 3 star prices. You will be sorry if you don't try this place."}
{"text":"I mean for a local brewery it was nice.  However, I had a very hard time finding something on the menu that I wanted to order.  It was somewhat pricey.  I ended up with the $15 mac n' cheese; I think the cost was due to the amount of bacon on the dish!  It was pretty tasty, but nothing super special."}
{"text":"After shocking all my friends that I'd never -actually- been to the GLBC, a handful of us went for drinks and dinner late on a Friday night. Late enough to avoid the crowd and get a patio table -- cold beers and a hot evening goes very well with that setting. I'll mention the food just because I got it: my salmon was fine by me, just slightly overpriced for what it is (I guess that's what you pay for Lake Erie's Best).  The beer. I miss. Great Lakes. So much. I had a few Lake Erie Monster's and a Dortmunder, and I think they both taste significantly better on draft versus bottled. If you're never been, you should check out GLBC at least once."}
{"text":"Overall this would have been a 4 or 5 without the tremendous slow service we had. It was pretty busy and they were severely understaffed with 1.5 bartenders. I say 1.5 because the one gentleman appeared to not have a care in the world. Then we ordered tasters and they messed up two of them. Luckily, the messed up beer selection turned out to be good. The tour was excellent."}
{"text":"Again, another great experience here at GLB. $4 Conway on a Saturday evening. Love the basement level, the dark lighting is exceptional and creates a laid back atmosphere. The televisions had the Cavs game on where Kyrie hits another gamewinner as the cheers filled the room. Bartenders serve quickly and the beer is exceptional and not outrageously priced. Definitely coming back to try some food. Just get there early if you don't want to stand."}
{"text":"They do a tour which is pretty cool. I love the beer here especially the Christmas ale, but not a huge fan of the menu. I prefer healthier options, and this menu is mostly pub grub. The patio is nice. I would recommend for after dinner drinks."}
{"text":"This place is great! I was here briefly, so we just had some snacks, but everything was yummy. The charcuterie board had some local meats and cheese that really hit the spot. And of course, the beer was awesome.   The store is also really cool to check out - especially if you're a tourist like me. We wanted so many things! I ended up leaving with a tin of Burning River.  Definitely a fun place to check out!"}
{"text":"Cool place with great beer.  The upstairs is a small bar with gift shop behind it, and the downstairs has a smaller bar with a lot more room to stand.  There are also some small tables down there as well.  If you never tried Great Lakes beer this is somewhere you have to stop in even if it is for just one drink."}
{"text":"GLBC has recently starting gaining national recognition without compromising the atmosphere at their restaurant. If it's in season you definitely have to try the Christmas Ale or if you like IPAs be sure to try the Chill Wave! You really can't go wrong with any of their beers. Be sure to check out the atmosphere in the basement!"}
{"text":"Great spot to stop to grab a drink or even to sit down and enjoy their menu of pub type selections. My boyfriend absolutely loves their beer so we made a pit stop, had some appetizers and enjoyed some of their seasonal brews! I love pretzels wherever I go, these were a bit different than the traditional pub pretzels, worth trying! They give you this amazing mustard with the pretzels, that is what made it! The Christmas Ale is so much better fresh off the tap, definitely worth trying some of their others too.   We had no problem getting a seat right away, but I do think you can put your name in online on your way over. There have been others times we had a brief wait. So make sure to look into that before you head over. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Don't hate me - I'm not a beer drinker. My friend, however, is, so off we went to the GLBC. We arrived on a Saturday at 4pm and it was PACKED. The hostess nicely explained the wait, 20-40 minutes. We decided to venture to the basement bar and found two seats.   We were greeted immediately by a very nice gal who offered us menus and took our drink order. My friend ordered the Holy Moses, and though I don't care for beer even I could detect the chamomile and coriander.   For our meal, we split the cheese beer soup, my friend ordered the brat and pierogi, I ordered the side of pierogi and a side of homemade tots. We liked the cheese soup very much, creamy and rich. My friend never stopped raving about her dish. I can vouch that the pierogis were quite tasty, and the side I ordered really was big enough for a small appetite. I barely touched my tots, though delicious with a great spicy sauce on the side, I just wasn't that hungry after the soup and pierogis.   Our main bartender was great, but the other one could have used a bit of polish. The downstairs bar is lots of wood and rock.  Good visit. Though not a great place for vegetarians, it had a few options. If I was local I'm sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"I love a great local company and to see Great Lakes thrive in Cleveland is refreshing. I am a sucker for their Christmas Ale and go out of my way to get my hands on it. I even pay the absurd price of 5.50 for a glass of it. I believe their prices weren't that high but all the local bars around me charge that much. Damn our demand for Christmas Ale is very inelastic...anyway, great stuff. Last night was the first time i went down to their actual place and loved it. I didn't get any food but it looked amazing, so i have to go back for another round at least.   My only complaint is that there just isn't enough room, the need to expand badly. i know they currently have plans in the works but it pretty bad when we had a 3 hour wait... Good problem to have though.   I also tried the pumpkin ale and OMG it was better than the Christmas ale?! I loved it, it actually tasted like pumpkin pie. It was great. So in summary, great beer, great company, and probably good food?!"}
{"text":"Pros:  gorgeous interior with tons of wood.  Open the Thursday early afternoon we visited.  Close parking lot with fair price.  Beer flights.  Large attached gift shop.  Cons:  we have yet to find a beer from them we really like.  Bathrooms are in the basement (as is another eating area, usually opened for dinner)."}
{"text":"On the basis of the beer alone, Great Lakes earns 5 stars. 2 stars subtracted for the hit-or-miss nature of the food. The bleu cheese burger easily earns 5 stars, while the promisingly named Stilton Cheddar Soup (made with Dortmunder Gold Lager) disappoints severely. I've eaten here 3 times now, and my advice is to stick to typical brew pub fare. If it sounds extravagant or overly gourmet, it will likely disappoint. Ultimately, if you order well and wash it down with a pub-exclusive brew, you'll be extremely happy you made the stop."}
{"text":"I went here with the family and the food is superb! I had the Mac and Cheese. Good gosh, I wish this place wasn't 500 miles from where I live. I'd be there much more often! The atmosphere is your typical microbrew (not complaining). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good, beer was good, it was packed when we went but it was also the weekend so it was expected. One suggestion I have I wish there was a beef dish on the menu. There was no steak or anything like that. I have been here a few times and never disappointed. The prices were good and reasonable. If your coming here I would spend the money and do the beer flight. You came to a beer restaurant so you must do the sampling."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed, honestly. Being from the Detroit area, we were really looking forward to a little road trip here. Sadly, it was one of our least favorite stops on our trip.  We did the tour to start, which was eh. It was alright, and definitely wasn't the worst brewery tour we've done, but far from great. They had a couple beer samples on the tour, but they seemed super stingy about it, like they were running low on beer and had to ration it.  Later on, we tried to get a beer at the taproom. The bar rail was almost empty, so we sat there. The bartender didn't even acknowledge us. And the tap list was so sad... there was ONE taproom exclusive, and the rest was stuff that I can find at any given liquor store back home. I was really hoping for some one-offs or special batches.  GLBC does good beer, but I wouldn't bother coming back here, even if I did happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I am rating this place primarily as a brewery and only secondarily as a restaurant since it is, after all, primarily a brewery.  How is the beer?  Outstanding.  Without a doubt this is the best American microbrewery, in my opinion.  I have only tasted a handful of beers that are on par with the better beers produced by Great Lakes, and I have never found an American brewery that can consistently produce brews of the same quality.  My favorite beers are the Edmund Fitzgerald porter (my fav. beer in the whole world) and the Burning River Pale Ale...I'm also a huge fan of their Locktender Lager and their Conway's Irish Ale (in my opinion, the best Irish ale I've ever had, and it isn't even Irish!), but all their beers are good.  The food and atmosphere is decent...about what one would expect from a brewpub.  I'd say the food is above average for a brewpub but nothing earth-shattering.  It's all about the beer!  Ahh I miss this place so much...I can't get their beer anywhere on the east coast and it is driving me insane!"}
{"text":"We came to Great Lakes with pretty high expectations, and I can honestly say that we were not disappointed. We took a brewery tour, which was very informative and fun. We sampled many of the beers that we'd already had, but there were a few on tap that we hadn't had the chance to try yet, so that was very exciting. I LOVED the Rubicon, and my husband was a big fan of the Black Out Stout.  We hung out in the bar for a little while before landing a table, after which we ordered some dinner. We started with the Bruschetta which was topped by all these yummy mushrooms (love), then my husband ordered the Old World Burger, with the beef coming fresh from the West Side Market, and I ordered the Pretzel Chicken (comes very highly recommended) and it was amazing. The service at the restaurant was EXCEPTIONAL. We saw our tour guide a little bit later and he mentioned that all the servers at the restaurant have been there for 10+ years since it's such an amazing place to work. Our server (wish I remembered her name) had been there 18 years. Amazing place to visit! Definitely worth the trip out!"}
{"text":"1) my cousin's wife's birthday party on Saturday was going to have just Miller High Life, Miller Lite, and Mike's Hard. 2) I am kind of a beer snob. 3) I don't want to inconvenience and bankrupt my family by making them buy a ton of smaller-brand beer for their party. even in Ohio, that stuff costs ducats!  how to settle this dilemma? compromise: we'd go out to places with good beer choices on Friday, and I'd drink High Life on Saturday. as it turned out, I did, but after I had plenty of hard liquor, so it didn't really matter at that point anyway. sweet tea vodka for the win...  man, I shoulda been an ambassador or diplomat or something.  rolled in here Friday night with the cousins. we were told an hour wait, so we went to another place (await THAT review as well!) to grab some drinks in the meantime. about 15 minutes later, got a call that a table was ready.  the table was the caveat. this night, Cleveland was something like 90 degrees, and 80% humidity. the table was all the way in the corner outside, so there was no ventilation. thankfully our waitress just kept bringing pitchers of cold water and of course cold beer!  the beer menu listed 10 brews on tap. I asked if there was a sampler option and the waitress said \"okay, 1 sampler\". as it turns out, the sampler is all 10, plus whatever else they have on tap, so in total I got 12 glasses that were probably about 5 or 6 ounces. honestly, I enjoyed every single beer that was there. Eliot Ness and Nosferatu had to be my favorites though.  so far as food, I had a pulled pork sandwich with chips. interestingly it was a bit sweeter than most BBQ pulled pork I've had. also, they mixed the cole slaw right on top of it. I devoured the whole thing! I poisoned the chips by putting malt vinegar on them...my cousins refused to touch them, which meant I could eat in peace! *strokes goatee in evil genius fashion* overall people seemed satisfied - it's pub food, it's not gonna be fantastic but it's gonna be good.  total bill for 7 people to have dinner and several rounds of drinks each was $150. nice! service, food, and beer were all great, I just wish the weather was cooperating.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place! We went on the tour first, sampled the beer, and saw how it's made. After getting a little buzz, we went to the restaurant and bar for lunch. The Old World Burger was the best! Really smokey with a hint of BBQ and cheddar and good beef flavor. The beer on tap is directly pumped underground to the restaurant tap and tastes fresher than the bottle for sure. Burgers were slightly overlooked but delicious all the same and the fries were crisp and toasty. A definite must when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good beer and good food! The pierogies were good. The veggie burger was pretty boring. One of my friends really enjoyed the chicken pesto sandwich. My other friend got a hamburger and found it a bit dry. I'd be happy to come back here, though I don't know when I'll be in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"How I miss great lakes beer! The brewpub located in Ohio city. Whenever I'm in town I try and stop by. This place gets packed! But if you make reservations you don't have much of a wait. The vibe is cool lots of people beer and music. The food here is great I don't think i ever had a bad meal. But if you're here you need to try the beer! This place is the true meaning of cleveland rocks."}
{"text":"I could sum up this review in one sentence - we have never had a bad experience here!  It's great to go here and be able to get beers in the beer cellar, Before they're even on the market or while they're still in test production.  The food is great! I've had everything from a beet salad to one of their burgers. However I wish they would bring back their kettle chips. :/  The staff is always friendly whether behind the bar, serving on the floor, or if they're off shift having a sampling of one of Great Lakes good brews!"}
{"text":"Love the beer and the downstairs cellar-like atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This Brewery is right in the heart for Cleveland. It's a great place to stop by if you are in the area, the brews are one of a kind and tasty! They food just complements it! Check it out if you are in the are!"}
{"text":"The mushroom pizza and beet salad were delicious!   Great atmosphere! Currently drinking growlers of Elliot ness in our hotel room!"}
{"text":"They don't call it Great Lakes for nothing!  I was there when my German cousin came to Cleveland (There's many Breweries and Bars in Germany...probably packed during the World Cup Finals) and I had Christmas Ale and a Cuban Sandwich...this was after Thanksgiving Weekend.  That Thanksgiving of 2012, I was thankful that my German cousin had a Thanksgiving meal...I hope he brings that tradition in Germany now!"}
{"text":"I like most everything with \"Brewing\" in its name. Just sayin. I like the whole Ohio City area and the adjacent West Side Market in fact. We've been here many times to sample the wares, have lunch, even take the tour which offered some samplings of beers that weren't on tap at the bar. That was nice. I love several of their beers - Burning River at the top of that list. And if I'm feeling like I need a little extra, I go for the Lake Erie Monster. As long as I'm not driving! For lunch we've tried quite a few things including the Cuban sandwich (house made pickles are really good!), the brewhouse burger (get the blue cheese!) and the old world burger on a pretzel bun. How can you not like a pretzel bun? My fav is the signature black and blue burger with Cajun spices.   It's a really nice atmosphere with available outdoor seating for people watching. Can get crowded, especially if you want to sit near the bar - which I always prefer."}
{"text":"We had a great time. Our tour guide Sarah was fantastic and Your get 5 5oz samples for your $5 tour charge. It's light on the brewing science and heavy on the history which is actually fantastic for this tour. This brewery is very serious about the environment and sustainability and I appreciate hearing more about that piece. Also see a lot of the background of their label art at the beginning. Fantastic tour and well worth the incredibly small charge."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night around 6:30 with some locals who suggested to eat here. We made a reservation for 6 people. When we arrived, our table was still occupied, so they moved us downstairs. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes, but it was fine because we were chatting and I wasn't starving.  We shared some tater tots for an appetizer. I ordered the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and prosciutto grilled cheese with a side of carrots. The tater tots were very large and clearly homemade. They were very flavorful and unlike and tater tots I have had before. The dipping sauce that came with them was also good. The EF Porter was flavorful and smooth. Not the best porter I've ever had but it was pretty good. My prosciutto grilled cheese was delicious and exactly what I was craving. My only criticism is that the cheese was not fully melted, but it wasn't a big deal. The carrots were grown in the restaurant's garden, and that's why I ordered them. I have not had garden carrots in a long time and I loved them. They were perfectly cooked (lightly cooked and still crunchy) and delicious.  Our crowd was very chatty and the service was attentive enough without being intrusive. I imagine it would have been a challenge with our constant conversation, but our waitress did very well. I enjoyed my visit here and look forward to visiting again when I am in town."}
{"text":"*Eats words*   The food is all quite tasty and honestly, this is a great place to go if you're out in Ohio City on a weekend and you don't want to deal with waiting for a table. I guarantee it will be packed--it's just such a large place there's almost always a seat.   And the food has been upgraded (has been for a long time) so this review is way overdue. The majority of the menu ingredients are sourced locally--and you can taste the difference. Lunch, dinner--it's all good. Tasty classics: Pretzel chicken, cheddar soup, all the flatbreads and I hear through the grapevine the Cuban is off the chain. But I'd also try their most traditional salad with grilled chicken. I'm not sure if they have it year round, or if it's seasonal. Either way--it's delicious!   Beers: 5  Food: 4 Overall: AWESOME"}
{"text":"Simple the best nation wide brewery.  Resturant is solid but if you love outstanding craft beer this is the place to be. (Love the cheese soup myself)"}
{"text":"Great brew pub with a huge selection of beer across the range from light lager to stouts and everything between. The huge store front is a bit misleading as the interior, while huge, doesn't take up the whole block like it looks like. I didn't gst to take the tour but the brewery smelled hoppy delicious when walking past. The downstairs bar was awesome and had great atmosphere. It was a bit odd that there was no one over 23 there, but it didn't prevent having a good time. The beer sampler was incredible. There were a few I didn't enjoy like the amber and the stoudt, but there were enough other delicious ones to offset it, especially the Belgian. I wish I had been in Cleveland longer to fully enjoy the bar. Bonus, the staff was nice enough to put on an out of town hockey game for me."}
{"text":"Terrible beer. Decent food. Tons and tons of beer tourists. Wouldn't recommend it unless you're an amateur drinker or have people from out of state who are amused by bad beer."}
{"text":"Just came here for the second time. Love  the beer but absolutely the worst service ever. Saw our waiter once and finally had to ask for the bill so we could leave. The hostess acted all put out when I asked her to see if our waitress could check us out. Really don't plan on coming here again. Lots of other places to go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It's a reliable food and beer establishment. When I have friends or family visit, this is on my list of dining, due to its relaxed ambiance, friendly service, good food, and great beer. Great Lakes Brew Co is also located in a great location and you get a real sense of what restaurant culture is like in Cleveland. There is street parking and a car lot behind the restaurant for easy access. I have not personally done a tour of the brewery itself, but friends tell me  its a must before I move back to Los Angeles. I recommend sitting on the patio on a late summer afternoon with a group of your best friends, eating good food and relaxing with an ice- cold brew."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our July 3rd day off at GLB sitting on their patio and having a leisurely lunch. Their front patio has a European feel, with cobblestones and an iron gate. It was lovely to dine al fresco on such a sunny day. Our server was very efficient, especially considering how busy they were. We arrived about 40 minutes after they opened and their was a 30 minute wait to sit outside. They have a very efficient notification by text system.    My husband and I split a beer flight and then he had the Lightkeeper Blonde Ale and I had a glorious Bloody Mary. For an appetizer we split the Pub Bites, which were excellent. Not too heavy or greasy, but perfectly battered. My husband had the BBQ Pizza and I had the  GLB-Cubano. We were both perfectly satisfied, although I found myself picking the pulled pork out of my Cubano. The sandwhich was much thicker than I expected, but the locally sources bread was incredible. Overall, it was a wonderful lunch, and we will be back again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Monday so it was pretty slow compared to a weekend day. Hubby loves the beers here ... me I'm not much of a beer drinker. I absolutely loved sitting in the outdoor patio area. Seems to be dog friendly as there was corgi at the table near us. The menu promoted local foods and ingredients. The pizzas look fantastic. I got the mac n cheese which was very good."}
{"text":"Beer aficionados can make the case that this place is the best thing about Cleveland or perhaps all of Ohio. If you like beer and are visiting, then you simply must go. Across the street from the fabulous West Side Market, they offer world class beer, a beautiful wood bar and great food. Recommended sampling : Dortmunder Gold, Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and Nosferatu Ale."}
{"text":"My husband and I took the brewery tour and it was fantastic.  The tour guide was amazing and very knowledgeable.  The whole brewery was neat, clean and well organized.  We later came to the restaurant for dinner.  Service was phenomenal, food exceptional, an overall memorable experience!!  Thank you Great Lakes for a fabulous venue for my Husband's birthday!!"}
{"text":"I frequently go here for dinner or just drinks and am never disappointed.  Good interior and exterior decorating and seating/space between tables.  Always seated quickly, very accommodating to groups.  Food is amazing - always fresh and local.  The beers are great and i like that they provide \"beer education\" with their menus.  Hands down the best place in Cleveland, i would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Needs me a 4pack of Alchemy hour...sold out everywhere I've looked"}
{"text":"This place is great.   The food is good, the beer is good (obviously). I mean you can't go wrong with this place.   They have an \"upscale\" dining area that is pretty nice for a special night out."}
{"text":"A definite staple in my trips home to Cleveland. Great beer, good food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Now I have never been here to eat, and the beers seem okay, but really this review is for the events GLBC throw.   Winter 2013 some friends and I went to a gingerbread house building contest they had and it was a blast! For like $25 per group we had two hours or so to to get creative with tons of candies and beer bottles. See attached photos to really appreciate the awesomeness of what slightly intoxicated adults can build.   They had some light appetizers for us to all enjoy and the top three teams won prizes."}
{"text":"We were visiting from New York and GLBC was recommended by a staff member at our hotel. It was our best meal in Cleveland. The sausage sampler, chorizo dip and burgers were all really delicious. Its also very family-friendly, my son loved the pasta from their \"half-pint menu\" and crayons and coloring page kept him busy during the whole meal. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. The beers were also very good, the barrel aged stout was a favorite. Unfortunately we finished dinner too late to visit the gift shop but I would highly recommend GLBC and we will definitely be returning on our next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"My friends and I started off with the sausage plate appetizer and the soft pretzels. The sausages were good and varied in flavor. I liked how both of the mustards that came with them were spicy, and the cabbage and pickles were delicious as well.   For out main courses we all split the herb salad, smoked pork belly, and the buckeye burger. The salad was beautifully presented, huge for the price, and nice and fresh. The smoked pork belly was perfectly accented by the cannellini beans, wilted kale, onions, and tomatoes, and all of it cooked down a bit into a smoky and flavorful sauce that made me want to lick the plate. I was hesitant about the burger, but the carmelized onions and beef paired so well with the barbeque sauce and peanut butter that I was converted, and now understand.   We had the Cleveliner Weisse, the blackberry wit and the Edmund fitzgerald. All of them were delicious, but the Weisse with it's tart sour characteristics was my favorite, and probably the best beer I've had from them.  This is a solid restaurant and brewery, but the waitstaff seemed stretched pretty thin and service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"I've been informed that pint glasses are actually $7.99. Still ridic, if you ask me ;-)."}
{"text":"Great place to visit in Cleveland.  Excellent beer and good German style food.  The Gose sour is excellent and refreshing.  Also really recommend the Altbier.  Very flavorful with very smooth finish.  The beer garden and outside seating space is nice.  Pick freely from the german style food - sausages and red cabbage, really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I want to be great but that is mediocre.  I don't drink, so I'm missing a huge part of their appeal, but they do have food and a kind of restauranty feel, so their food should be good.  I guess it is.  It's OK.  And the atmosphere isn't as interesting as it looks when you walk in."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and some food! I enjoyed all the seating options that were available including the covered overhang area to keep off the rain. My friends and I shared the Local and Fresh Plate. It was a great assortment of cheeses, pickles, and meats. The pepper jelly went well with most of the other things. The Hungarian sausage was meaty and had a nice spice. I loved the bread they provided. It was perfectly toasted and had a nice chew. My only disappointment was that they weren't doing Christmas in July. I was hoping to try some of their Christmas ales there."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten in the restaurant for a while, but my recollection is the food is overpriced and pretty average.  However, the beer.  That is why you come here...the BEER.  The downstairs pub is wonderfully rustic, and the servers work hard to make sure your glass is not empty for too long.  On weekends, all of the bar areas are jam packed, so come early!"}
{"text":"If you're in Cleveland, taking the brewery tour and then stopping by the brewpub is definitely worth a visit. The tour is fun and interesting (and you get to sample four beers). The pub has a great selection of pub exclusives, as well as your favorites, and good food to boot."}
{"text":"Best beer in Cleveland.  I love the Nosferatu when they have it and the Christmas Ale will knock you on your arse."}
{"text":"Excellent location for those who like to eat and drink outdoors. Ate there on an unusually warm day late November. Sunny garden in back with giant Fred Flintstone wooden tables and stools."}
{"text":"The kitchen is the real downfall here. They have a great thing going with gaining so much popularity with their brand. However, every time I've eaten here my food has been luke warm at best. Most recently, they brought me food that was so burnt it was uneditable. Multiple people got the same thing as me and mine came out in a state that should have never left the kitchen. I asked for a replacement. After waiting 45 minute for my first dish, I got to wait another 20 for my second dish. My second dish proceeded to come out barely warm. This barely warm matched the rest of the dishes at our table. Where else in Cleveland do you have to be concerned about your food being cold? I can't think of anywhere. Food always tastes okay. I imagine it would be stellar if it was a decent temperature. They clearly have a wait time because of their kitchen. They at least call you via cell phone when it's your turn."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended to me, even though I'm not a beer drinker. I was looking for comfort food and a comfortable environment at the end of a long day on a business trip. This place delivered.  I had the macaroni and cheese with Amish chicken. It was delicious - creamy and tasted homemade. My server was attentive and confirmed that the Amish chicken was in fact raised on an Amish farm - free range, etc.   It's a little overpriced (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but otherwise a great place to visit."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you expect something unexpected in your glass. What you will find are solid beers, good food, and great service."}
{"text":"While I've been here MANY a times, not sure if I ever wrote a review. However, this past week I met my husband for lunch and had our little 8 month old papoose in tow. We were short on time so we picked something out in a hurry that was close to the parking lot. If you try to come to Ohio City when the west side market is open and lunch time, fair warning, the place is a zoo! So it's better to pay 3 bucks and get a close parking spot. As soon as we entered the restaurant I just felt bad taking our daughter somewhere that has the word \"brewery\" in it, not so much for her or us, but for the other diners. Plus this is an older building so it has uneven pavement and steps, etc. I immediately started to worry we should have gone somewhere else, but I'm glad we stayed because the folks here were SO accommodating it was very much appreciated. They walked us through the server station to avoid steps with our stroller, and gave us a table with plenty of room. The food was the next best part. The special, meatloaf was divine and the chicken pot pie was a la perfect. Thanks again for another wonderful meal and service! I should note I definitely wouldn't make a habit of bringing kids here, because it is much more of an adult atmosphere."}
{"text":"When it comes to beer, I'm quite the snob. I've drank many microbrews across this great nation and Great Lakes is by far the best. The pub exclusives just blow me away. There's nothing like scotch ale. It's so smooth with a nice scotch finish.  There's all the beers that everyone knows about of course, but the pub exclusives are by far the best. I hope their Rye of the Tiger comes out soon as I just got into eye beer and I have to try it. As far as food goes I highly recommend the Edmund Fitzgerald batter cod bites. They hit the spot. I can't wait to try their Dortmunder gold bratwurst the next time there."}
{"text":"Checked out Great Lakes Brewing Company on a Saturday afternoon after visiting the City Market. I've always been a fan of GLBC beer and was excited to check out the restaurant for the first time while visiting from out of state. The restaurant was packed but we managed to quickly get a seat on the patio.   The service was a little slow to start but the waitress that took care of us was very friendly.  Everyone in our party ordered a different beer and we were happy with our selections. My boyfriend and I decided to share a Hero Sandwhich and we were glad we shared because it was huge. Others in our party ordered the beer cheese soup, lobster crab cakes, and the grilled cheese Sandwhich and everyone was very pleased with their selections. GLBC does a great job of using local products and lists on the menu where all of the ingredients are from which I loved about it. It was obvious how great are dishes were that the best ingredients are used at a reasonable price.   The Hero was delicious and the pub fries were perfect!   The restrooms of the restaurant were downstairs which included an old pub looking area which was packed with locals out enjoying a summer afternoon in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We came for a local beer and food and we're blown away by the quality and freshness of the food at this brewery. My beet salad was amazing! Topped with crispy basil and drizzled with olive oil that I could taste, it was a great surprise and a much needed healthy meal after lots of heavy foods earlier in the day. My husband's BBQ chicken salad was just as fresh and tasty! P.s. The oatmeal stout and perry IPA were just as tasty :)"}
{"text":"Pretzel app is delicious, the burgers were perfectly cooked and the beer was awesome!! The service was ok but certainly nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"A fun place with a decent selection of brews on tap. We  went there after the program interview.  I order some salmon and a lager.  I like the ambience, although I wish I was sitting next to more of the prettier girls from our interview group and less with the guys that were interviewing.  Overall, the food selection was great and so was the brews"}
{"text":"If you know me, you know why I love this place.  Amazing outdoor seating on a great street for people watching, delicious mac & cheese, and decadent desserts can all be found at this little gem!  First, the mac & cheese.  Listen, the bacon bits are an amazing touch.  Makes the taste SO GOOD!  I had a local beer (whose name I cannot remember... but it was a blonde ale), and that was also very good despite me not being a huge beer drinker.  The dessert... oh boy... we couldn't decide on just one, so we got two.  The ice cream, which is apparently made locally, was awesome!!  The cheesecake was the star of the show!  All I will say about it is that you MUST try it if you go there!  You'll thank me later!  Our server, Mia, was very friendly and even split our checks without us even asking her to!"}
{"text":"Best service ever! Waitress Kristin appeared at our table with a pitcher to refill my iced tea the very second that I took my last sip (did I slurp too loud with my straw or is she just a superb waitress with eyes on the back of her head?  Thoroughly enjoyed the very gourmet vegan squash salad with arugula, quinoa, walnuts and carmelized red onion.  Not that much quinoa; lots of walnuts and squash.  I enjoyed the dressing, which I requested on the side.  Entertaining view from our window seat on the second floor.  If you're not a local, make sure you stop at the indoor market across the avenue ."}
{"text":"Stopped in GLBC on a Friday night following a Cleveland Indians game.  We decided on two orders of SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS - Gerber's Amish Farm house-smoked chicken with housemade Edmund Fitzgerald Porter barbecue sauce.  Each $11 order includes six (6) complete wings: drummette, wingette and the tip/nub.  The house made sauce is served on the side in a small dipping cup.  The wings were smokey, meaty and hot off the grill!  We had to wait a few minutes before we could pick them up and begin to dig in. A dip in the sauce provide just the right amount of tangy sweetness accompanied by a hot pepper slow burn... not too little and not too much.  Our beer of choice this evening: $5 each  Cleveliner Weisse - (the brewers description) Brewed in the traditional unfiltered way but with a tart Lactobacillus flavor, this is one of our favorite ways to ring in those first warm days on the patio. Adding our housemade fruit syrup is the proverbial cherry (or raspberry) on top.  Eliot Ness Amber Lager - (brewers description)  It's a smooth, malty (and dare we say, arresting?) paradox.  Almost untouchably smooth--armed with lightly toasted malts and noble hops.  The service was prompt, helpful and friendly even though we came in within about an hour of closing.  GLBC, always a good choice."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company is a Cleveland spot! The food is yummy and their beer selection is on point. They have their seasonal favorites on tap and their menu plays off of their impressive beer list. There is a cute gift shop where you can purchase your favorite Great Lakes T-shirt or cooler to make your beer drinking experience that much better.   This place is ALL about its beer!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes. It felt more like an applebees. Of course the beer was good and there are a few selections that are only available in the pub. But that feeling....like you don't belong...everywhere. I guess I thought it'd be a younger crowd. Instead it was a lot of 50+ year olds acting like they were 21 and under. I was not impressed. The food was pretty expensive for what it was and I felt like going to the brew pub down the street. However, it's GLBC. you sort of have to/want to go. Just don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Another highlight of my trip to Cleveland.  Great Lakes makes some very good beer, but if you're a local you probably know that already.  The two I tried--the Dortmunder and the Eliot Ness--are easy to drink without tasting like water (I'm looking at you, Bud).  I'm sure there are people who can talk about beer more eloquently than I can, but I will say one thing.  I had the Dortmunder for the first time on tap at the brewery and it was awesome.  I noticed that it was served a little warmer than I would have expected.  Not warm like British beer warm, just not super cold.  The next night I had it elsewhere out of a bottle and very cold.  It wasn't as good.  I don't know if it was bottle or temperature, but I'm going to take a case back to Maryland with me and experiment.  On to the restaurant.  I splurged (and took a risk, considering I generally don't like fish) and got the Arctic char, which came with rice, spinach, and a tomato-cream sauce.  The fish was fantastic, not fishy at all, and the sauce was great.  The rice and spinach, however, were extremely bland.  Just a little more sauce would have saved the whole dish, but for the most part the only flavorful bites I took had some of the fish in them.  I'm only docking one star here, though, because the fish really was tasty.    Service was great as well.  Our waitress was funny and personable and brought our food out pretty quickly.  I'd definitely go back if I ever found myself in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars, oh heck, I will... but that was close... it was almost a 4.  I do a lot of travelling, and try to sample the local fare when I have the time.  I'm a HUGE fan of Great Lakes' brews.  They are so tasty, and I have many a fond memory of cooling myself with a Holy Moses on an obscenely hot summer day or losing myself in the unsightly amber hues of Mr. Eliot Ness.  It makes me happy just to think about those liquids of love.  I stopped into the restaurant for at late lunch a few months back.  It had been a long day, thus far, and was pleased to make it to the home of one of my favorite beers.  I had the honey mustard chicken sandwich.  The food was good, but maybe a little pricey (though, that's probably because they purchase their food from local sources, which is much-appreciated).  But I'll say this, they had a pub-exclusive beer called the \"Alberta Clipper\" on tap, which knocked my socks off.  I was so infatuated with the beer that I didn't even finish my fries (and I'm of the no-fry-gets-left-behind theory).  It was chocolatey and raspberry-y and I can hardly think about it without being sorry I don't live in Cleveland. ::sigh::  In any event, the place was overall tasty but maybe slighly pricey... but the super-fantastic beer makes up for any price differential."}
{"text":"I am not a Great Lakes Brewery fan (except for Edmund Fitzgerald). However, we went to dinner there to meet a friend. The food was subpar, and the Cleveland Brown Ale tasted disgusting. Still not a fan.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, which consisted of pulled pork on a bun with fries (I did not get coleslaw on it). I also tasted the mac and cheese which was loaded with bacon! It was pretty tasty, but still the beer is what shines at the brewery.   There is also a gift shop to purchase their items. They have a downstairs bar and an upstairs seating area (that was empty on a busy night). If you enjoy Great Lakes beers then drink you liver off!"}
{"text":"One of the best local treasures in Cleveland.  Yes, it is overly hyped.  It is your basic brewpub menu.  So I am not an alcohol drinker but enjoy visiting this place on a regular basis.  The menu is based upon fresh, seasonal local produce.  The items are tasty and well prepared.  Portions are generous.  Ambience is fun-filled, great place to get together with friends.  I would recommend this as a place to stop for those visiting Cleveland.  Only negative is that it is not very handicap accessible."}
{"text":"The funny thing is that I go to GLBC for the beer and atmosphere and always leave most impressed by the food. The beer is good with a nice seasonal variety. The old wooden bar right when you walk in, which is from the 1860s, and the stone walled pub in the basement create such an authentic feeling like you are back in time 150 years ago. During my last visit there were a group of guys at the bar singing some song in German. Very cool. The servers are typically very cool and knowledgable. But the food is outstanding.  One of my favs is the butternut squash ravioli with Swiss chard and walnuts. Prices aren't bad for the quality you are getting."}
{"text":"We went here in the fall and it was insanely busy and noisy. They squeezed us into a little table against a window which had a great view over the street of people buying Christmas trees. We didn't mind the tight atmosphere or crowd too much assuming that it was part of the charm of this place around football season. Plus we didn't have to wait for a table. I got the porter and a pizza which were both superb. There were TVs around so we could watch the games and our server was very attentive. If you have a fear of feeling crowded you'll want to avoid rush hours. Wonderful beer selection. Great time, we'd totally go back"}
{"text":"The food-- so good. The beer-- i'm not a beer drinker, but great selections. The beer tour-- sucks.   The beer tour: my friends and i signed up for the beer tour. It was actually my first beer tour ever and all i can say was, I was bored out of my mind the entire time! the beer factory looked old and dirty and the tour guide was kind of just rambling on-- did he really know what he was talking about? after going to my 2nd beer tour in Toronto at the Stem Whistle, I realized... Great Lakes Brewery Tour really isn't good. 1-star.   The beer: if you've read my other posts, i don't really drink beer. However, they have a beer sampler which I know people love. I come here for happy hour with coworkers and everyone ADORES their beer. So, definitely worth trying. 5-star.  The food: YUM! What has I had before? the corned beef, the cheese appetizer platter, the sausage, and their pasta. Nothing has failed me yet. YUM. I've been here probably 7 times now and I still love it...even if the wait can be up to 30mins long."}
{"text":"On the way to the east coast, my brother & I stopped here for dinner. I ordered a beer sampler to get warmed up. As for me, I am a \"malty beer\" guy. Hoppy beers are ok, but I lean toward a Scotch Ale, porter or stout. All the beers were good. There was no skunky or moldy taste from dirty beer lines. Each was disitinct and good. The Dortmunder and EF Porter were my favorite while my IPA nemisis, the Commador Perry, had to announce his presence. The fish and chips were good as it was Friday. Crispy, hot, nice salt flavors, the fish & chips were well received. My brother ate the brats and pierogies, licking his plate clean. I must remember to keep my hands away from his plate. One growler to go and I am off to the next adventure."}
{"text":"I really didn't expect much when I came from Columbus to go on a brewery tour of Cleveland. But Great Lakes was on my top 2!! Great beer choices, fair prices and hopping vibe!"}
{"text":"Good for the beer, \"meh\" for the entrees.   That is all."}
{"text":"I think an ideal spot before a game, going out, or for happy hour. Shuttle to the stadium as well. Had lunch with a friend outside on a very nice patio area. Parking right off Market St. - $2.50 but fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service & great beer!! They also have bad ass shirts in the gift shop. Their dessert is also so good!"}
{"text":"Very fast attentive service, tasty falafel burger and great tater tots.  My husband loved the Blackout Stout.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the flight which is samples of TEN beers.  TEN.  I think they were all about 4 ounces or so...which resulted in too much alcohol for me in a short sitting.  I felt compelled to drink fast so I didn't have warm beer at the end.  I inadvertently started the flight backwards...regardless, I liked them all except for one (blackout stout)..but it's probably just my personal taste.  Most of their food options were friend and heavy and things that probably generally go well with beer but the beer is heavy so it was hard to eat heavy too.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the waitress recommended the pretzel chicken so I went for it.  It was really good but it was fried and that disappointed me...because I tried to ordered grilled and was deterred.  But NBD, you only live once I suppose.  I love the interior which was windy and seating sections up these stairs, on that patio, next to the fireplace, etc.  It was some standard layout which I enjoyed...made it seem like an old house. Walls adorned with posters of their own brews and a working fireplace.    I enjoyed my time and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've had quite a few of Great Lakes Brewing's offerings over the years since it's readily available in Michigan. Some are great, some are good, and some are meh. Since we were at the brewery, I tried the Wolfhound Stout and the Triple Dog Dare, which are both pub exclusives I won't be picking up at the store.  The Wolfhound Stout was pretty good, and it's a plus to be on nitro. The Triple Dog Dare, on the other hand, wasn't as good. I thought it had quite an aftertaste that made it hard to finish.  The food selection here seemed pretty good, and I went with the pretzel chicken. I had never had pretzel-encrusted chicken before, and I think I was expecting to be more exciting. But it really was just like anything else you might put on chicken. It was good, but not really pretzel-y.  The staff was great, but this place was packed and I felt a bit anxious from how cramped I felt."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Saturday Night dinner.  We arrived around 6 o'clock and while it was rather busy, we were quoted a 30 to 45 minutes weight.  We thought that was fine and were told we were welcome to find seating in the bar.  We walked in and found a table right away, so our weight time was really small.  There was a large selection of beers (obviously).  I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband had two small 5-oz samples before settling on a pint.  He' s had Great Lakes Beer before so he tried to stick to the kinds he hadn't had or hasn't seen elsewhere.  We had the pretzels and mustard as an appetizer.   To be honest, I didn't care for the cheese sauce.  The husband DID seem to like it (and ate it all).  The yellow mustard kind of seemed on par with French's, but I did like the spicier brown.   The pretzels were okay but, honestly, we've had better elsewhere that I don't think can be topped, so our exceptions were probably high.  Both of us ended up ordering shrimp and grits, a real favorite of both of us.  The grits are mixed with cheese and chorizo and served with tiger prawns (three) on top.  I would have loved more chorizo (I'm a HUGE fan), but over the dish was very good and I was stuffed before finishing even half.  The husband usually finishes my leftovers and couldn't, so I'd say the portion sizes were pretty good.  However, his grits were far more lumpy than mine.  I know this happens with grits (we cook them often) but I'd expected them to be a little better.  Since we opted to sit and eat in the bar, it was quite loud.  We could converse across the table, but we had to raise our voices a bit.  The bar, itself, was crowded the whole time.    Great Lakes does work to provide locally sourced food as much as possible, which we like as well.  As far as kids, I'd have no problem bringing mine to even eat in the bar.  It wasn't a super over the top bar scene, so I'd have no qualms."}
{"text":"A 9 sample beer sampler is a home run! They have a great choice of food on the menu. The beer was great and the food is also, which often enough is not the case with breweries (good food, bad beer or vice versa)."}
{"text":"Delicious. Didn't have the beer, but if the beer-cheese soup was any indication, it would have been delicious too. I started with said soup, and was shocked by the symphony of flavor. The name is too unsophisticated for the flavor profile of the soup. It was utterly fantastic.  I had the pretzel chicken as an entree and was similarly impressed. The pretzel, mustard and potato all blended well, and created a delightful combination of flavors. If you're ever in Cleveland, and looking for some high quality gastropub type bar food, you can't go wrong with Great Lakes."}
{"text":"We walked in & the hostess said we could sit at the bar or outside.  I then asked if there was a waiter for drinks & she said no I had to get my drink myself.  It was a nice night outside so we sat out there.  Unfortunately not many of the tables were cleaned off & there was no one outside working on it.  We cleaned off our own table & sat outside for about an hour there & left. It just wasn't inviting & the music sucked.  It was fun to people watch those walking by.  The beer was okay.  Its a really large place so I'm not sure how it all works.  I think that they should have wait staff outside cleaning up & taking drink orders though especially on a Fri night.  We may have stayed longer if they did."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer! So amazing! And a beautiful patio (that allows dogs) and nice seating indoors. The prices are reasonable as well and the service has always been very good. Their tasting is really fun and extremely well priced. I love their soft pretzels and incredible cheese dip also. I've had some of their other food and haven't been terribly impressed, but this is a wonderful place for appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the many quality beers that come from this place and I had been wanting to eat here for a long time. About a year ago, I got my chance and it was great! Their beer selection alone is worth the trip, but the food was good too. The items on the menu are interesting and stimulating with a beer bread pudding (which was awesome!).  I highly recommend the Great Lakes Brewing Company. The atmosphere is also quite nice and comfortable. It is a great place to relax and stimulate your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer, it's cool to drink from the source, even if it is only 4 hours away. Maybe other tables had better ambiance, mine was tiny, not enough room for the 4 plates, had a pole blocking my daughter's seat and a chair sticking out into a busy aisle, with waiters and customers alike bumping into it. That row of 3 or 4 tables between the door and gift shop just shouldn't be there.   I was expecting the beer infused food to be more beer like. My brat supposedly had beer, but it tasted like any old grilled grocery store brat. The bed of cabbage it was served on was burnt. The beer cheese didn't taste of beer. Didn't taste of cheese for that matter. The Pot Roast was dry, the burger was overcooked and dry - because it was a very lean cut it was ground from, a positive if you like that sort of thing. The ravioli was great.  Service was great, dessert A-OK. They have the potential to be something really special if they'd hire an experienced, creative chef who could make the food taste as good as it sounds on the menu and give it real beer character."}
{"text":"So, let me start by saying that I am a huge Great Lakes beer fan, and I was super excited to finally go here.  The atmosphere is old world pub, there is tons of cool art on the walls, mostly Great Lakes beer posters.  There was a lot to look at.  I had three different beers, the Altbier, which was a German style beer, the Dortmunder, a lager and the EDmund Fitgerald Porter, I also had a taste of the Conways Irish Ale.  I loved all of them and can't even pick a favorite, they all had great flavor and were delicious.  I wish I could give the food three stars, I liked the atmosphere and the beers so much that I giving a four star rating, however if it were base solely on the food, it would be three at most.  I ordered the pretzel encrusted chicken which came with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, my friend ordered fish and chips.  Both the chicken and the fish were overcooked, my chicken was very dry, I was happy to have some kind of sauce, maybe it was a gravy for the potatoes, to help with the dryness.  All of the sides were good, including the chips and especially the green beans, I did really like the green beans.  I would like to add that we were charged for two fish and chips meals and I'm glad we caught it, because with all the different beers we tried it would have been easily missed on the check.  What bothers me about that is if our waiter accidentally keyed in two, why didn't two come out and if not, then did he add that after our order came out, either way, it just seems fishy.  I'm looking forward to going back for more beer and I think I will try one of the burgers that kept coming out of the kitchen looking delicious!  Oh, and I also want to sit in the basement, it just looked so cozy and inviting down there."}
{"text":"This is a MUST see every time we go to Cleveland.  Good food!   Great Beer!!!! Relaxed atmosphere.  Our favorite place to be is down in the pub"}
{"text":"Never again.   I love Great Lakes brewery they support the metro parks and are a great company.   Support their 5 k and was happy to see the purple purse non profit today.

Give him a raise and fire this piece of shit Chris  w .... Please ! Otherwise you have lost a great customer"}
{"text":"What is the big deal about this place? The food is overpriced and you can get the beer anywhere. I don't get it at all."}
{"text":"The setting is beautiful, and the service in wonderful. The beer is so good! We didn't have any food this time."}
{"text":"Delicious bratwurst and perogis!  Great Brianne Barr like atmosphere but is also good for kids during the sits in a great neighborhood with lots of other bars and restaurants to complement. Would recommend this for anyone wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"GLBC as a place for good beers: 5/5 GLBC as a place to eat: 2/5  Service is always good--I've never had a problem.  Even when it's crowded, I've been taken care of fine.  The beers are always good and I love the pub-only special brews.  But the menu isn't all that great.  I wish it had better food, but I just can't claim this as one of my lunch or dinner spots.  It's a spot for great beer and that's it for me."}
{"text":"As an Ohio native, I had been wanting to get to this place for awhile. I've drank their Commodore Perry IPA but decided to switch it up at the restaurant and was not disappointed. Was also highly impressed with the food -- most breweries have \"meh\" offerings but this menu was hard to pick what I wanted. Would 100% recommend this, especially because of its location in adorable Ohio City!"}
{"text":"Just went for drinks and although the place was packed on a Saturday evening, we were able to get served in a decent amount of time. The bartenders work their asses off here. I really enjoy the downstairs atmosphere, all kinds of people. I also though that $4 for the Ness and Conway was a decent price, pleasant surprise!   So even at my third time there I still give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Have been to Great Lakes Brewing Company many times.  Food is delicious and, of course, there is the beer.  Great selection, wonderful service, good food -- perfect way to spend an evening in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Tasty IPA, cool basement area, located in a central part of Ohio City -- right across the street from West Side Market -- I really liked it."}
{"text":"This is a great hang out. So my brother and I always go here around the holidays and find it to be the best time of year to go. With Christmas ale pouring freely and the fire burning just makes for a great day. Did I mention the other beers they offer. They always seem to have a few different beers u can't get in the local stores, so we always try them. For the most part they are solid, so give them a try."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Great Lakes Brewing! My family and I had an early dinner on a Friday night, so we stopped in later for some apps and drinks. The food was fantastic, but I have to say the beer wasn't that great. I ordered a flight of 5 beers, and there was nothing that I really loved.  I ordered the beet caprese salad and it was phenomenal! We also ordered a side of fries and a flat bread pizza that was also so so so delicious! We sat outside because it was a perfect night. The outside ambiance was so cute and quaint. Little string lights everywhere. It was really cute. The hostess stand was outside, so I couldn't tell you what the inside looks like.  Here is why I docked a star: my mom ordered the raspberry beer on tap. It was terrible. She took one sip and that was it. She told the waitress, \"I'm sorry, I don't like this. Can I have something else?\"  The waitress didn't take the beer the back and still charged us for it. I wish she would have done the right thing. I would go back to Great Lakes Brewing for the food, but I wouldn't order a beer."}
{"text":"I hate to be a naysayer in the midst of all the accolades, but in my opinion Great Lakes is one of the most overrated places in Cleveland. It's not bad, as such, but it's not the great experience that people make it out to be.  I feel like I'm proclaiming that the emperor has no clothes here, and I've tried GLBC on a number of occasions, mostly based on, \"everyone says it's so awesome; I must be remembering wrong.\" Then I get there, and it's perfectly competent bar food, but I don't hear the choir of heavenly host singing in perfect harmony that seems to accompany the meals of other diners.  If I'm to be honest, the oversell has probably cost GLBC one star in my review, but that's kind of the problem: this place just doesn't live up to its billing.  So if you go there, you will get decent bar food, and okay beer. Just go with your expectations adjusted to the proper level. This is not fabulous. It's merely okay. If you're prepared for okay, you'll do fine. If you go in thinking it's a five star experience of anything, you're likely to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bier is outstanding - from the Christmas Ale to the IPA.  You can actually smell the brewery walking from the parking lot across the street; authentic.    Unfortunately, service could be much better - I visited on Monday night at about 8 pm, it was crowded, so I went to the bar.  It was about ten/fifteen minutes before I was even greeted and served!    Food is adequate; service could be better.    Again, bier is outstanding, able to purchase in stores - brewery has a concession in the airport in Concourse A...  Will have to visit again to see if my experience was an exception and not the norm."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last few years but I will focus this review on my last visit. I joined a few friends after work to attend \"beer school\", located in the beer symposium on the side of the brewpub. What a great experience!  We enjoyed a tour of the brewery and learned about the science behind making beer. We then sat for a tasting of 6 beers, paired with a delicious Great Lakes pretzel and snacks. The staff educated the group on the history behind each beer as we went along. At the end you get a t-shirt and a glass to take home. Great value and great night!"}
{"text":"Fun place to have lunch!  I'm not a beer drinker but tried a recommended beer (can't remember the name :-(   )   for \"non\" beer likers and did actually like it. The joint was packed (Friday after Christmas) which is a good sign.  Had a turkey reuben sandwich which was delish! Fries were crispy and seasoned with lots of salt and pepper and rosemary!  Would def visit again if we're in town again!"}
{"text":"The beer is amazing and be sure to ask for the \"Poutine\" with extra chicken!! The Poutine is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place, a Cleveland staple...but I have to think they have a better way to manage all the bodies in there! Super packed this past weekend and it was pretty difficult to grab a beer - but the service is fantastic and Leigh H. is one of the main reasons I frequent."}
{"text":"A visit to Cleveland is not complete without a stop here.  This place has all of the three done well.  Atmosphere, food, and beer.  Atmosphere from the dark pub in the basement, to the rich wood bar at the entrance, to the sidewalk tables, whatever you are feeling, Great Lakes Brewing Co has the seating for you.  The stone wall, dim lit pub in the basement is my favorite.  What is the weather outside, what time is it, who are you? who cares, because in this bunker of a pub you will lose track of all.  The entrance bar is a classic that probably took an acre of wood to make.  There is a bullet hole in the bar from prohibition agent  Eliot Ness (don ruin it for me).  The outside seating is great area to observe the comings and goings of the West Side Market area.  The food is above average.  Great are: the Mac and Cheese,  the Sausages cooked in the Great Lakes Porter, and a very nice local plate.  The local plate features a variety of very fresh items from around the area.  This is not a fill you up plate.  I will avoid giving a lengthy dissertation on the brews of Great Lakes Brewing.  So the short version.  (The opinion expressed here are of my personal taste.  My opinions just happen to be right.  Don't be so hard on yourself for being wrong.)  Xmas Ale excluded: best: Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, best seasonal: Conway's Irish,  second best: Burning River.  They are all good though."}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions and have yet to have a bad time.  The service has always been friendly and helpful.  We tend to always order the sausage platter appetizer and it is awesome!  It is nice to see a restaurant/bar source so much of their food locally.  It is also nice that, even though they are a brewery, they do not forget about people with children.  They have a nice kids menu, also sourced with local ingredients.  If you come here, take a few extra minutes to look around.  There are some interesting and antique bottles upstairs.  Attached is also a shop where you can buy the beer and other merchandise.  If there is a beer that you love that is a  brew pub special you can always bring or buy a growler and take it home.  If you come on a weekend, it fills up quickly.  If you have a long wait, you can always walk around as there is a lot to do in the area."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and had the Pretzel Chicken. Not sure how they do the crust but it's awesome. Mashed potatoes were perfectly lumpy. Carrots were pretty good too. Nice location and ambiance. Good music. Tasters (5oz) are the way to go to sample the beer, each was about $2, give or take. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I always visit Great Lakes at least once while I'm in Cleveland.   The beers are world class! There is always something new they're cooking up. The last one I tried was the Sonic Belgian IPA.   The food is incredible, I've barely been able to explore the menu unfortunately because the black and bleu burger is so freaking good.  If you haven't yet tried GLBC, here is your sign. Go do it now."}
{"text":"Our tour guide was very knowledgeable & energetic. I would recommend touring the brewery!"}
{"text":"If you love craft beer, this is a destination to get to.  For a brewery, they really do the restaurant/pub experience up really well.  Multiple rooms, great decor, delicious dishes, and tons of great brews.  If you go on their website you can reserve a spot on a free brewery tour in advance.  We came out on a Thursday night, checked out the gift shop, did the tour, had dinner in the lower level bar area, and enjoyed some more beer later in the evening up at the upstairs bar.  I recommend the pretzel chicken, and the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter Ice Cream - we loved the ice cream so much we came back the following day and bought a pint of it.  We love this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"Well, I'll first state that my review is biased due to the fact that Great Lakes is one of my favorite breweries.. don't get me wrong, the tour was great, and so were the samples, but the brewpub was a bit of a disappointment.  So I went with some family and friends to one of the brewery tours offered on Friday afternoon.. even met Patrick Conway ,one of the owners, which was pretty cool.    The brewpub was quite a bit of a letdown, even with having a nice buzz from all the samples.  Bratwurst really just had the texture of a large hot dog, barley pretzels really just tasted like regular pretzels, etc.  The pub exclusives were an even bigger disappointment, the Jabberwalkie sour ale just seemed like an excuse to sell what really is just beer with rotten yeast (otherwise it didn't seem very remarkable), and the Bourbon Barrel ale was really too sweet tasting and no bourbon like characteristics.  Regardless - I still give a solid 4 stars for the regular beers and the tour, just don't expect too much out of the brewpub."}
{"text":"ok. great lakes is a cleveland staple. it has been around forever and everyone seems to love it.  good beer? of course. duh. it's great lakes. however, with so many new craft breweries popping up, i can honestly say, GLB is just ok. christmas ale?! or evil ale as we call it.....beware, makes you do things you probably would not do if not drinking it :) #justsayin anyway, the competition has definitely gotten bigger and i now think that GLB would not be the brewery i would necessarily go to if i was craving a beer. food-not impressed. it is just ok. i do love that they utilize the west side market's vendors for food prep. many local shops being supported.  if you are looking for somewhere to go that cleveland is known for, then by all means stop in. it's just something you have to do."}
{"text":"I've always loved great lakes.  The food has always been delicious, but the beer is really the draw.  i love going to great lakes before indian's games and riding over to the stadium in the fatty wagon."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for vacation and the Great Lakes Brewery was highly recommend. Great spot with a fun outdoor patio.  Ordered fish and chips, and was really happy! Huge portion of code, was well worth the $13 price tag. My wife ordered Pesto Chicken and had to bring half back to the hotel.  I suggest the taster option with beer. I recommend  the Lake Erie Monster and the Edmond Fitzgerald Porter. Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Nice vibes, friendly staff and good food. Had to sample all of the beers. Loved the Porter. Not going to say which ones I disliked because that's everyone's own personal taste. We ordered 2 salads and they were ok. Had a side of kale with bacon and that was so delicious (besides it being very oily). This place is dog friendly and was nice to have a water for him (with ice) in a cute baseball cap size bowl."}
{"text":"A perennial Cleveland hang out, but I've never had a good time here.  The food is only about 2 stars, and there is nothing so impressive about drinking a Great Lakes Beer at the brewery that you can't experience from drinking the exact same beer at the bar next door.  It's worth it to buy one drink and get on the shuttle downtown, but not worth much more.  The service can be really, really lousy.  I once spent an entire afternoon drinking on the patio with a group of friends only to be informed that because it was now after a certain time, we were required to either order food or move tables.  We didn't want food, so the server explained that she could cash us out and we could move to another patio table that did not have table service and we could instead wait in line at the bar for every round.  This was even though about 3/4 of the patio remained unoccupied, we'd been there for hours, and our tab was more than $100 at that point.  We took the check, and moved... to another bar."}
{"text":"Not for beginner beer drinkers - and not for your friend that loved Bud Light.  Great staff - great beer related foods (like beer cheese soup).  Good for parties - they have a banquet room upstairs and - well - just a cool hangout - has been for years.  Christmas Ale is really the pinnacle in my estimation of why to make the trip - but you won't be disappointed by any of the offerings.  Would be 5 stars, but - unfortunately - they know that they are the \"pretty girl in the room\" - not a hidden treasure, so they price accordingly.  Not unreasonable, but certainly not a bargain.  Great place - many good memories - and a couple memories erased by the beer too :)"}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewery is a must see for anyone visiting Cleveland, and especially anyone who lives in Cleveland.  The beers are amazing and the servers are very adept at helping you pick the right one for you.  I had the Alberta Clipper at my most recent visit which was a porter flavored with chocolate and raspberries.  It was one of my favorites!  I really enjoy their burgers, especially the Black and Blue burger and the Old World Burger.  Their French fries are also amazinggg.  Keep in mind this place can get packed, especially when they are releasing their more popular beers such as Christmas Ale.  I've definitely been quoted 1.5 hours on a busy night for a wait, so keep in mind.  Also, parking is a little annoying.  Street parking can usually be found on neighboring streets.  There is a valet and a public lot nearby, however the public lot fills quickly."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was OK.  A bartender the night before somewhere told us that while we were in Cleveland we HAD to eat here, so we took her advice and grabbed an early dinner here after spending the day at the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame.  Like I said, it was alright.  We had 3 different servers through the meal (dont know what ANY of their names were, and was never told that someone else would be taking care of us... all the sudden, someone else just started coming to our table).  The first server suggested the pizza because it was half off, so we both had one.. they were decent, but not something that I think I would have suggested to anyone, and definitely not something I would order again.  Not that they were BAD, but I think (or I hope..) they have better choices.  We originally ordered a beer flight of all 6 specialty beers, and I didn't like any of them (not because they weren't good beers, I'm sure they were, but for someone who isn't a big beer drinker- it was a no go), so my husband just drank all of them, and when I ordered a soda, our SECOND server laughed at me.  'Nuff said, I think.  Anyway, it was an experience, and we both like trying new places, especially local spots, so I'm glad we went.  It just wasn't the amazing time we were expecting based on what we had been told.  And to be fair, maybe all of that isn't normal- sometimes things happen and you just draw the short straw.  But we weren't super impressed.  Good gift shop, though.  They sell most of the specialty beers in the shop and you can make your own six packs of whatever you want.  Plus they have some nice merchandise to choose from, too."}
{"text":"Loved our lunch and beer selections here. The pierogis were awesome. We sat upstairs but the pub downstairs looked really cool."}
{"text":"Odd that I would be here since I don't like beer, but, the rest of my group of four do. I have to be fair here, I was not hungry when we arrived. We shared Nach-Ohs, Local & Fresh Plate and the Smoked Chicken Wings. In addition, we had one Cleveland Cobb  Salad. The wings were a bit bland without the sweet hot sauce that was served on the side. Unfortunately that means that they were good but only because the sauce gave them flavor. I wouldn't order them again. The Nach-Ohs, Local & Fresh Plate were both good but not over the top. The Local & Fresh Plate was very pricey for the quantity and variety. I didn't sample the salad but I was told it was good. Since I don't drink beer I have to rely upon others to tall me that the beers they had were all good. Certainly worth a visit, especially for beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"Well brewed beers.  good food.  great seating outside.  Could still see the TV inside for the Indians game. Server seemed pre-occupied."}
{"text":"3 and a half for Great Lakes. We went for the tour and stayed for dinner. The space seemed similar to the Great Dane in Madison. Big, pretty, and has a downstairs sort of dungeon bar. I was a little bummed they didn't have any cask conditioned ales. I guess that was a lot to expect, but the dungeon really did seem perfect for a cask pour.   The tour was good, not great. Our tour guide, Erica, was funny and had a lot of info on Elliot Ness. Not too informative on the brewing process. I've been on a ton of brew tours, so I feel pretty \"in the know,\" but my mom and the other tour mates maybe would have preferred she slow down a bit. That being said, they pour three generous tastings, and it's all free.   They have a gift shop, so I guess business is doing pretty well! Dinner was good; we shared the cheese and meat plate which was great. Also shared the brats and pirogi and pickled cabbage, which was totally delicious. I wish they had more beers on draft that you can't get in a bottle in Chicago. I feel like that is really the treat of going to a brewpub; you've had their six or so beers that they bottle, but the seasonal stuff you can only get there is usually mind-blowing. (i.e. Tyranena, Two Brothers, Goose Island, New Holland...)   Good though, and really easy to get to from Downtown Cleveland. One stop on the RTA."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic local beer selection - wish they had a certain peanut butter porter I'd tried elsewhere but still so great.   Ate the veggie, white-bean burger with these yummy tater tots. So good, couldn't eat it all, so filling. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Waitress was super friendly, helped map us some things to do nearby for the afternoon. Even told us the house from A Christmas Story was nearby. (We had no clue and were happy for the nice walk and fun discovery.)"}
{"text":"Interesting brewery tour, good guide, terrific beer. GLBC is part of  America's rediscovery of beers with character. Loved hearing their origin story and seeing how their beers are brewed and bottled. Especially respect their zero-waste philosophy. Good dinner at the taproom after the tour."}
{"text":"Beer = 6 stars.  Food = 2.  This was always the thing that pissed me off about having GLBC and Rock Bottom both in Cleveland.  Rock Bottom's beer was decent and all, but it was a chain, and so not too exciting.  But their food was really great!  I miss the salmon fish and chips!!  GLBC is the best beer anywhere.  Period.  IMNSHO.  The bourbon barrel blackout stout was heavenly.  This year's Christmas Ale, while not their best Christmas Ale ever, is still better than 99% of the beer sold in this country.  The Quitness was very unique and delicious, and even their pilsner is a stand-up beer.  But, the food... oh, the food.  Pretzels, check.  Sausage platter, check.  Dessert, check.  Entrees?  Bzzzt.  What a bunch of lame-o crap.  I had the mac and cheese, and it was like a side portion and nothing to write home about.  My wife had the flat iron steak, which was weak.  Cut up and put into my mac and cheese, I created a 3-star dish.  One of our friends got the butternut squash ravioli, and it was flavorless mush inside of dried out noodles.  Bleh...  But the beer rocked, and I will remember next time to just do beer, pretzels, sausage, and cake."}
{"text":"I'm not really much of a beer drinker, but I like the service here. I usually go on Tuesday nights for trivia and grab some drinks and food. The food is hit or miss, but the drinks are usually made well and the service is fantastic. Plus the trivia is a lot of fun.  The atmosphere here is great, and I definitely recommend it for any night of the week."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating that this restaurant... Of course, I drink their beer a lot!! But never visited. I can say that the place is very nice and inside of a very nice area of Cleveland called \"Ohio City\". Lots of nice places close, but we had to go here for the beer :)  We also decided to eat and ordered their \"old world hamburger\" with fries. Very... VERY... good food. Burger was big, loaded with stuff, and messy! The fries were perfectly seasoned and crisp. We will absolutely go back again!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Great Lakes Brewing Company and was equally excited to come to the homebase and try their product fresh from the source.  Was not dissapointed.  The XMas was delicious, even somehow even better than the drafts available in Pittsburgh.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly and not hard to find.   I only wish they had more options for appetizers, especially veg ones. That said, the menu did have a decent amount of veg entrees but still a meat and potatoes kind of place."}
{"text":"Brewery tour was just right: informative while not being too technical or too simple. When we checked in for the tour, we told our guide we were planning to eat at the restaurant after the tour. She called the restaurant for us and helped us set up a reservation so we got a table as soon as we walked through the door on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Wow, I don't even recall writing a review for them but, sure enough, one of my first Yelp reviews 4 years ago. Still, after the all the traveling and beer exploration since, including moving to Indiana and closer to their home territory (although I still have to drive to Ohio to get their beer), Great Lakes is still one of my national favorites. My now annual summer trip to Cleveland is one of the highlights of my year. It's hard to get past the drinking and eating, since it's all so good, but I also keep coming back to Cleveland for other reasons, and Great Lakes almost embodies all of it: friendly, salt-of-the-earth sort of place that merges modernity with historical preservation. The bar at the brewpub is reminiscent of an Irish pub, and the basement bar just works to extend that. One thing I should say that I haven't said already: in all my annual pilgrimages to this place, it's ALWAYS crowded. I mean, I just stopped there at 3pm on a Monday, and there were two seats at the bar when I came in, with people starting to stand as I hung around. But they lure me back with small batch, brewpub-only selections, like the milk stout that I had today. Wonderful. There are a lot of great bars in Cleveland, but I keep coming back here because I know they'll have something I cannot get at any of those great bars."}
{"text":"When was the last time you went to a restaurant that had 3 levels?  We started the night in the basement having a beer in a rustic little hide-out downstairs.  From there we were seated on the 3rd floor against a row of windows looking over the street.  If you've been to a GLBC before, you know about their own beer selection.  What you might not know is that you can get a sampler set of all 10 beers with 5 oz glasses for $15.  Normally you pay more for the samplers, but this one was right on par with ordering individual beers. The pot roast was delicious, the mushroom pizza chocked full of mushrooms & pretzel chicken all got great reviews. The server was aggressive, but nice.  This was the first place I heard the server say that beer is not required, but highly suggested with dinner. We didn't eat the desserts, but they loooked great.  A great place to go with a group of family or friends for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! The food is only OK, not that I've ever been unhappy with it, but it's never been anything special either. But let's be serious, you came for the beer and they don't disappoint. They always have a few beers on tap that they don't carry in the store, which is a nice change of pace. Go there, you'll love it."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Great Lakes Brewery to try the new beers on tap and for a late lunch. The service was friendly. We didnt have to wait for a table as it was on a Thursday in the middle of the afternoon.    I ordered a taster of 3 beers, the Comador Perry IPA , the Eliot Ness amber and the Moondog ESB. My other half ordered the Burning River Pale ale.  All the beers were yummy. My favorite is the Burning River, followed by the Moondog ESB. The Burning River is available in bottles, but the Moondog ESB is a pub exclusive. They offer \"can growlers\" which are 32 oz cans of any beer they have on tap..sealed right there at the bar. Of course,  I purchased a Moondog ESB in a \"can growler\" to go.   We also ordered lunch to go with our beers.  We both ordered the fish and chips. The food was good. The fish was a typical northeastern fish fry, made with batter dipped cod, served with thick cut fries and homemade chunky coleslaw.  The fish and fries were crispy but we're not piping hot when they were delivered to our table.   The only reason I didn't give this establishment a 5 star was the location and the parking situation. There are public parking lots and street parking available but if you are in a vehicle larger than a typical size vehicle, it's hard to find a place to park. Although we were warned by Google maps that parking could be difficult.    We would return to this establishment if we were driving in a different vehicle or taking an Uber, but otherwise we probably would pass this establishment by. Try it once and see for yourself."}
{"text":"When in Cleveland I always make it a point to stop by two places before I head home - West Side Market and Great Lakes Brewery. The restaurant itself offers brews right from the brewery and often has special brews on the menu. The food is always great. The patio is warm and inviting! Don't miss the gift shop and make some time to take a tour of the brewery itself!!"}
{"text":"Visiting our TV-news-reporter daughter in Cleveland, she and her significant other took us for lunch to this fabulous restaurant in the charming Germantown district. It was pouring rain, but we're happy we dodged the drops to get to Great Lakes Brewing Co. Our friendly, capable server, Alex, recommended the Dortmunder beer and it was soooo good ... the second one was equally so. I ordered the homemade sausage assortment appetizer, pretzels and their house salad -- we haven't had sausages this delectable since we were in Germany last fall. The pretzels were the real deal and the many mustards that accompanied these plates were perfect (and I'm not even a mustard girl). My husband had the soup of the day, a very serviceable New England clam chowder, our daughter had the salmon burger which she proclaimed scrumptious, and her significant other had pork BBQ which he deemed delicious. While this restaurant specializes in beer, they do offer a full bar. We look forward to our next trip to Cleveland and another meal at Great Lakes Brewing Company."}
{"text":"Great night out with my family, including 4 kids.  Waitress was very accomodating to their requests.  As a Cleveland native, I love coming back here!!  Great beer, local foods, and good service.  A Cleveland staple.  Cheese and meat board was delish!  Beers always fabulous!"}
{"text":"Me and my family go here every year around Christmas time to enjoy the delicious tap beer that is made at this location and not available at any other retailer. The food is always delicious. This year we started with the tater keg, a homemade plate of tater tots with cheese that was absolutely delicious. We all tried different entrees including the bratwurst and pierogi, Po man sandwich, the brew house burger and the ramen. I ordered the ramen for myself and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the Great Lakes brewery for a delicious lunch or dinner, fresh beer, great welcoming and historic atmosphere and superb service."}
{"text":"It's been ten years since I've been here, but I'm happy to see that the quality of food and drink is as good as I remember. We had a flight (one of every beer on tap, which was five regulars and six newer varieties, in five - ounce glasses) for $16.50 and an order of pretzels. The beers were great, as expected, and the pretzels were hot, fresh, and perfectly salted. My only complaint was that I could have gone for more of the Stilton soup for dipping.   If you're in for a drink, check out the Rathskellar - style bar in the basement. Tours of the brewery are only Friday evenings and Saturdays, so plan accordingly if you really want to see where your beer is brewed."}
{"text":"I've been to GLBC at least 10 times in the last few years. It's one of those mainstay signature places that helps characterize Cleveland. After all, the fact that we have such a great beer, brewed right here in Cleveland is something to be proud of, right?   The circa 1865 Victorian building in which the Great Lakes Brew Pub resides has a ton of character, especially the basement! I also like sitting out on the Ohio City patio. At nighttime, it's especially charming with all of the lights that are strung about.  During our most recent visit, we sampled a few of the freshly drafted brews. The selection at the bar is more extensive than what you will find available at any given time in the stores. For instance, in July I had the Independence Ale, Prohibition Pilsner and the typically seasonal Christmas Ale (X-Mas in July, get it?!)  The food shouldn't be an afterthought either. While I've only eaten here a handful of times, I must say that everything I've ordered has been more than acceptable, especially the Bratwurst and Pierogi Dinner.   Overall, this is a very enjoyable place to go. Whenever I have family or friends come in from out of town, this is one of the few places I find absolutely necessary to take them."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but food service is slow, when on lunch break an hour is never long enough."}
{"text":"First time I went to this place, I had a better experience than the second. I had the blue cheese burger the second time around and my husband had the other burger on the menu (forgot the name). Both wanted medium well, but my husband's was sadly more well done and not juicy/tasty at all. My burger was the equivalent of me just eating spoonfuls of blue cheese. They put entirely too much leaving all other flavors hidden from your palate. We also had the tater tots because we LOVED them the first time we came here, but this time they were made extremely salty. We took a few bites, couldn't finish them, and had the waitress take them away. We were pretty bummed because they were perfectly seasoned the first time. The fries are delicious, though. And I had the fish and chips the first time I ate here, and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"GLBC is a Cleveland institution--and for good reason. While you can find many of Great Lakes' beers at nearly every bar and grocery in the city, the brewpub itself offers a unique experience.  The beer is obviously the major draw, as there are some options on tap here that you can't easily find elsewhere. Of the year-round Great Lakes beers, the Edmund Fitzgerald porter is probably my favorite, followed closely by the Chillwave (formerly Alchemy Hour) Double IPA. The seasonal offerings are always fun, particularly the Christmas Ale.  The food is solid. All your favorites are here--burgers, fish and chips, fish tacos, big German-style pretzels, and so on. Pretty much everything I've tried off the menu has been consistently good.  Service is generally good, but things can get a little slow on busy Friday and Saturday nights. The wait for a table can be long, especially in the summer, and unfortunately GLBC doesn't take reservations.  Definitely check out the cellar--the stone walls, old wooden bar, and fermentation tanks in the corner make for a great atmosphere. As a bonus, there's often no wait for a table down there, perhaps because many people don't even realize it exists."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer but sub-par food. Sounds about right for a typical brewery. I went to Great Lakes with a friend who love making homebrew. Great Lakes produce some excellent beer as we sampled majority of them. We also went on a tour which was neat but nothing new if you've been to other brewery tour. It was quite small actually. Nice outside patio seating and cool merchandise store.  As for the downside, the food here ranged from so-so to uninspired. Definitely needs some work. Nonetheless, I'd recommend going there for beer and tour BUT not for the food."}
{"text":"I love Great Lakes Brewing Company. I've been going here for several years and it's always a great time. The service is always top notch and the food is always impeccable! Lastly, the beers are so tasty. Highly recommend Great Lakes Brewing Company for anyone looking to have a great time and or enjoy tasty food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great beer and good prices. Service was also great. The bratwurst and pierogi entree was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service was better. Best to visit during the week if you don't want to catch the crowd. Great location for downtown. I definitely will be visiting again."}
{"text":"During my first (and probably last) evening in Cleveland, my boyfriend and I stopped in for a pint.  We sat at the bar and were quickly served by a friendly bartender (brunette lady with short hair).  We decided to split a flight of all of their beers.  I was pretty impressed with the variety and flavor of the brews.  My favorite was the Aloha: hoppy and slightly sweet.  We also had some wings and pretzels.  The wings were fantastic.  The pretzels, however, were awful.  They were like dry, over-seasoned dinner rolls.  Even the accompanying beer cheese was bad.  Besides that, I really enjoyed my evening at Great Lakes.  I wish we had more breweries like this in Virginia!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious atmosphere was great. Ally was our server she was awesome. Recommended a few things for us to try and wasn't disappointed. Thanks Ally for making our experience worth the trip. The grilled chicken Mediterranean wrap was a great light choice."}
{"text":"Great beer and food, loved the atmosphere downstairs, a lot of fun. Visited May 6, 2017, bartender downstairs she was awesome. Visited from Vermont."}
{"text":"Such a cool experience! Great food choices and obviously great beer! The basement of this place is awesome! We will definately be visiting again AND continue to purchase Great Lakes Beer!"}
{"text":"I love the beer here, and the restaurant is nice with really good service, but as far as food goes it's just pretty average. Stop in for a beer or flight and get some appetizers, but the food here isn't very memorable. In this case I am giving in 3 stars, because it is exactly what you are expecting. In the end it's Great Lakes Brewing Company and it's all about the beer, which they do really well!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food, too! If you are anywhete near Cleveland, stop in. Worth the effort."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat and drink.  I strongly suggest taking the tour of the brewery as well. GLBC is a class act.  Their beer is delicious and they always have a new brew to try!  Cleveland is lucky to have GLBC!!!"}
{"text":"I love Great Lakes Brewing! The beer is amazing. How can you go wrong with a beer called Dortmunder Gold, because it has won so many awards for being a great beer. When I meet friends from college in Cleveland this is our usual spot. The location is awesome being down the street from the Westside Market! It is sometimes hard to find parking though.   The alumni association from my college had an event there over the summer on a Friday night. The staff was great in helping all of us out. It's a must visit place when you go to Cleveland! The company is also 100% sustainable with the way they make there beer and the distribution model. If you go around Christmas time make sure to get the Christmas Ale it's to die for and sure sign that Christmas is right around the corner. I also enjoy the Edmund Fitzgerald."}
{"text":"I've bought enough Burning River Pale Ale in my lifetime that I should probably at least have my name on a barstool at this place.   Oh, this place is a restaurant, as well. For my busted-ass-broke self, it's a bit pricey, so I generally don't head here after work for a few brews and, say, a $20 steak platter, but it's great for bigger office get-togethers or, ideally, for when parents come to town."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place the most. Whenever I come here, I always split the beer sampler with my friends. If strong, heavy beer isn't your thing, I'd suggest trying one of their lighter beers. Cream Ale and Dortmunder Gold are good when paired with their artichoke dip from the appetizer menu."}
{"text":"This is a tough one because the beer was awesome, but the food was blah. We tried the 5oz sampler of every beer. Do it! It's perfect to split with another person, but no shame in ordering yourself. We took home six packs of our faves. Go for the beers, skip the food."}
{"text":"Really cool place. I wish we could have toured the actual brewery, which is HUGE and looked pretty cool (the outer walls were shaking from the music blasting inside).   The restaurant and pub were sooo much fun. The restaurant is upstairs and the strictly brew area is on the lower level... as are the bathrooms. DANGER, DANGER... climbing stairs after drinking their fabu pumpkin beer is deadly.   The atmosphere was wonderful, the service was all with a smile, and their selection was fab. We got there around, I wanna say, 7:00 ish on a Friday and realized that the lower pub area had a happy hour- Elliot Ness pints for $2? Did I say I wanted one? I meant I'll take 2!   If you ever find yourself in Cleveland be sure to swing by Great Lakes. :)"}
{"text":"I love the Ales produced by Great Lakes Brewing Co.!  I first encountered their bar location in Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. My introduction to Great Lakes was by way of Burning River Pale Ale and Commodore Perry IPA...  I enjoyed both of these Ales! Especially the Burning River Pale Ale! Such a crisp, nicely hopped, delicious Ale!  Then some of their Ales began to make their way into the Washington, DC/Northern Virginia market...  At some point I had their Christmas Ale last year...  And finally I get the visit the Beer Mecca of downtown Cleveland - the Great Lakes Brewing Co. Pub!  Now, we did come here for dinner - as my coworker does not drink beer. And if I were rating Great Lakes on the food alone - it would be a two star rating. The food I had just was not very good.  But I love the ambiance of this place. Old school feel due the age of the building. The basement Pub is especially cool - lots of old, dark wood!  We sat outside, ate our dinner, and I enjoyed another cold, frosty pint of Burning River Pale Ale.  I doubt I will come here to eat again, (I've been told I still need to try the Cheese soup) but I will come for the beer and the ambiance!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not a big beer fan but GLBC may have changed that. The tour was fun and it was really cool learning about the company and how they give back to the community."}
{"text":"Keepin it real deal Holyfield...best beers in Cleveland.  Period."}
{"text":"This is the spot I recommend all my out of town friends to. There is nothing not to like! They have done a wonderful job building a local brewery that everyone in NE Ohio can be proud of!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Po' Man sandwich and the Bratwurst and Pierogi. We split them out and really enjoyed both. The brats were cooked well and not dried out, the pierogies were delectable. The Po' Man sandwich was the star of the show however. We highly recommend it and it is a perfect portion size for a normal appetite and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Solid beers -- Christmas Ale defines my holiday season.  I moved away a long time ago, but whenever I am home, I try to make a stop at Great Lakes.  Great vibe, super chill, stellar food and beer."}
{"text":"I'm not a HUGE fan of craft beer, honestly, because I hate hops & haven't yet been able to figure out what I DO like, so I was a little doubtful that the GLBC tour was going to be up my alley. I like Dortmunder, but was I going to want to drink anything else?!   The tour is $5 a person, starting from the GLBC symposium around the corner from the restaurant. For as gritty & hometown a feel as the restaurant aims for, I expected the same of the symposium & the rest of the tour, which I was surprised to find was not the case. The symposium is bright white, beautifully decorated, clean decor, a very art-gallery atmosphere. While you wait for your tour to begin, you can sip tiny beer samples (included in your ticket cost) & explore the history of the brand.  Our tour guide's name was Alex, & I wanted to be his best friend. He was so knowledgeable & enthusiastic! He took our group of about 10 through the GLBC brewery, from the \"museum\" area upstairs to the brewing room to the bottling warehouse, explaining lots of interesting details along the way. I was fascinated to learn of GLBC's commitment to the environment; they strive to be waste-free, working with other organizations, companies, & brands in the area to use their brewing waste in sustainable ways that better & benefit the community.  And I didn't drink Dortmunder the whole time! I branched out to the Elliot Ness, which I really enjoyed, & then we headed to the restaurant, where we split an (AMAZING) charcuterie board & I branched out to try the High Stryker Single, a pub-only beer offering that I also loved.  Overall, the GLBC experience was a great one for me, & I'd recommend it to anybody looking to be better acquainted with the beer or with the best of Cleveland. This is a brand we can be proud to call our own!"}
{"text":"Decided to take the fatty wagon to the tribe game last night, all good until we wanted to leave in the 7th inning to grab a bite to eat.  Waited 45 minutes as the wagon passed us twice to take care of important people as we were told. I guess customers are not important to Great Lakes. Called twice and was told he will be there shortly. Lying to customers is not a good way to maintain business.  Brian, the driver apologized but no one else did.    Management try and get your act together if possible.  If you would like to offer an apology or some other form of compensation please contact me at ray.tomazic@gmail.com"}
{"text":"Pros: reasonably priced, food is good but not spectacular, paid (cheap) lot a stone throw away.  Brewery to visit Cons: Beer and food isn't going to make you do cartwheels,.  Let me preface this by saying, I am not a particularly huge fan of Great Lakes Brewing Company's beer.  However, this place was a pleasant surprise.  We went on a busy Saturday and were told a 45 minute wait (which ended up being much less.)  Upon sitting I ordered a flight... this is when I found out that it is about 14-15 bucks for a flight.  Now the amount of beers on the flight varies and we hit the jackpot on this day.  There were 11 beers- 5 oz pours.  So that's 55oz of craft beer for 14-15 bucks, \"winning\"  ;-)  Now I never go too far into detail on beers on Yelp.  As it was summer, there were a lot of IPA's and several of them forgettable run of the mill beers. Nothing that will shatter your world, but I do enjoy the finer things in life and by that I mean really good beer.  Food was a pleasant surprise.  I had the pork tacos and they were very tasty, perfect amount to scratch the hunger, while not taking you out of the drinking and walking around game.  My dad had a burger because that is all my dad ever eats and he said it was really good.  My wife had the grilled cheese, which I love grilled cheese but hate \"stinky cheese\" so be warned, the provolone and other cheese (it's been a month so the name is escaping me) is of foul odor.  They also have Cleveland staples like kielbasa.  All in all, this place was reasonably priced, has a good flight deal, and the food is pretty good.  I would definitely recommend hitting it as whenever I go to a city I have to go to a brewery.  It has great location and if you want to grab some other beers there are plenty of options, but I would still check this one off my list of breweries to hit."}
{"text":"This is a beer pub, and a good one at that. But don't come here hungry - the food is, well, I'm not sure - we left after waiting 45 minutes to get our order!"}
{"text":"Brussel sprout salad was pretty good but the sausage sampler was disappointing. The sausage was dried out.  Also tried a raspberry ale. It was delish"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Great Lakes Brewing Company in Cleveland, they made one of my favorite beers Nosferatu and wanted to visit for some time, just never make it to Cleveland, was in town for the U2 concert. Started out my visit with the tour of the brewery which is located in Ohio City neighborhood next to the West market - please book in advance online $5 takes about an hour and you sample 4 beers on the tour. All of the employees on the tour were very friendly, welcoming, happy to answer any questions you have on the brewery.  Then ate in the brewpub - note please make reservations this is a busy place & you can expect at least an hour wait on the weekends. We ate inside as it was too hot to eat outside, they do have a huge outdoor patio, which was filled with people. I had the chicken pesto sandwich with fries and my friend had salmon salad, they are now canning two of their beers (the canning is off site in PA), so tried one of the cans Rally Drum Red Ale which was good, the fries arrived fresh & hot flavorful, my chicken pesto was okay, the bread was a bit thick, too chewy to enjoy. My friend enjoyed her salad, wanted to stay longer, but had the concert to attend."}
{"text":"This was one of the most fun presents I got this Christmas.  My fella took me here for a tour, drinks and dinner. After getting a bit lost in the city (my fault not the brewery's), I got in just as the tour was leaving. Our guide was funny and informative. You walk around the entire brewery which is a big oval shape and are told that they employ less than 190 people there. I figured it would be way more because of their popularity.  After that we walked over to the restaurant and waiting for our reservation. We did have to wait at least and hour and a half, maybe two, to be seated on a Thursday but it was pretty busy around 7 and it was four days after Christmas so I can't say if its normal. We just spent out time at the bar drinking their fantastic beers (time well spent!)! There are are a few beers down stairs in The Pub (inside the restaurant, where the bathrooms are) they don't sell upstairs so go look!  We had a great waitress who was personable even though it was crazy busy in there and fast! We had the artichoke dip as our appetizer and it was spicy and tasty, but did not come with enough pita triangles if you ask me.  For dinner I had the Pulled Pork sandwich with garlic mashed potatoes. Man-o-man, was it good. The BBQ sauce on the pork was made with their Edmund Fitzgerald Porter (my favorite beer). The pulled pork had coleslaw on it which was yummy and light on dressing/heavy on cabbage and on the sweeter side but I like a sweeter slaw (not a slam, just a personal preference). The bun was dense enough to hold all the pork and slaw but not so dense it was heavy and unappetizing; the perfect bun. The mashed potatoes tasted great but could have been a tad more moist. Overall though, a great meal.  Bottom line: Yes, we had to wait but if you have the time grab a beer and chill out; its worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times, and the first two times the food was great. The last time that I visited, the food was ok, but I attribute my experience to the busy holiday season. I believe this is an old Cleveland staple."}
{"text":"Definitely do a tour and ask for Sarah! Brought a group of friends to Ohio who have never been here and they still talk about how much fun the tour was. Great Lakes beer is amazing and the food here is solid bar food. I come here every time I'm in Ohio and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Superb beer selection and food! Stick around for Christmas ale!"}
{"text":"Classic Cleveland. Great Lakes consistently makes some of the best beer in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Awesome beers and I love the outdoor patio space here. Every time I've been here it's always super crowded and you can barely get a table. If you go in the basement it is first come first serve but that's usually all filled up.   The food here is really good and they have a great menu to choose from. Everything I've tried here is so yummy. You can't go wrong with trying any of their beers on draft. Another great thing about Great Lakes is taking the fatty wagon to the Indian's games. It drops you off right in front of Progressive Field, aka the Jake. Last time I was on it it was only $1 to get a ride, and it's a lot of fun!!  It's also in a great location with so many other places in walking distance. I'm so happy Cleveland has a place like this. :)"}
{"text":"All the best beers, food and Cleveland history. Consistently yummy and good for the morals. GLBC does so much for the city and treats their employees well."}
{"text":"Nice place right outside of the city. Quaint town. I went here for dinner with my husband and 11 year old son and we really enjoyed ourselves. The mussels appetizer were great, it came in a delicious sauce that we were spooning up. I had the sausage and pierogi and it was a really generous portion. Dessert was phenomenal, the bread pudding is a must.  All in all, great service, great food. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We fortunately got stuck here during a heavy snow storm last year. The beers were all delicious, our appetizers were delicious and the service was great. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the customer service was poor for several reasons. It was my first visit to the Brewery and our server was efficient but less than pleasant.  1. Our server was efficient but I felt like we were putting him out. He didn't smile once.  2. I'm a cigar smoker so I asked if there was anywhere we could smoke a cigar and still drink our beer. He said we could smoke on the patio and he said he would even close the door near us so the smoke didn't go in the building. Mind you, we were one of the only customers there. Then, there must have been an employee meeting and one guy came over and opened the door right next to us. We asked if we should move and they said not to worry about it. Then 5 minutes later a lady comes out and rudely says you guys are gonna have to leave. We don't allow smoking here \"Especially\" cigars. All you had to do is ask us nicely to move to the other end of the patio but no. Rudeness prevailed.   So, long story short. I didn't feel welcome and they are rude to cigar smokers even though they have an outdoor patio. I wont spend another dime there ever again."}
{"text":"My favorite brewery in town. All of their beer is middle of the road to great. Awesome patio, I love the downstairs bar, solid food, nice vibe. Take a peek into the production area if the doors are open, it's impressive."}
{"text":"Beers were very good and the atmosphere of the restaurant is great. The menu item selection wasn't very robust and is pretty expensive for the portions.  However if you are going here for the beer and not the food you will have a great time.  If you are hoping for an amazing dinner you may want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. I have had Great Lakes beer before when I lived in Upstate New York, but after the move to Raleigh, North Carolina I couldn't find it anywhere! (although they have recently started distributing).  Anyways, I had to take a business trip up to Cleveland last month to prepare for the upcoming World Beer Festival, and I was finally able to try to their food and of course their beer in house which was amazinggggg.  I had the pretzel chicken that came with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. It was really delicious and I highly recommend you try it! I ate with two employees from Great Lakes and an employee's girlfriend, so they all had the food too often to judge  ;-).   Of course the food was good, but the beer is where it's at. I had a Pilsner and the Dortmunder Gold (IPA). Both delicious and even better fresh from the source.  I have to go back to Cleveland in a week and a half for work, and I am SO looking forward to stopping by Great Lakes Brewing Company again when I do."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before (the mac and cheese is to die for!) but on  this visit I just did the brewery tour. We had a 5pm tour booked and arrived around 4:15pm to try to get a drink before the tour and good thing we came early;it was so packed we could barely get in the front door. We went downstairs and that bar was just as crowded. Luckily the upstairs bar (which was mentioned to us by a friendly worker in the gift shop) was not crowded so we went up there and were able to get 2 brews before the tour. There were probably about 15 people on the tour which actually takes place across the street at the brewing facility. Our tour guide was very good and thorough in explaining the brewing process. They were brewing a batch of Christmas Ale while we were there and we got to watch that (sadly no samples though). They went into the history of the building which was interesting. Then the tasting part of the tour. Tastings are 25 cents for 2-the tour guide said per Ohio law samples of beer cannot be free. They only had there flagship beers (Burning River,Commedore Perry,Eliot Ness, Edmund Fitzgerald, and Dortmunder Gold) to sample so I went with the Burning river and the Commedore Perry (both my personal GLB favs) and my boyfriend, who is far less familiar with GLB chose the Eliot Ness and Edmund Fitzgerald. After the tasting portion you move onto the fermenting room and the production room. The tour is about an hour and is free but it fills up very fast so you need to register online far in advance. Definitely a cool thing to do if you can."}
{"text":"I feel like people scrutinize this place since it is a Cleveland institution. Well, there's a reason it's so well known. I love everything about this place. Between the rustic dungeon like bar in the basement that I swear is always crowded, to the beautiful quasi indoor outdoor part upstairs it's just a great place. They really revamped their tour (I've been on it twice in the past couple years) and it's well worth checking out if you have the time. I've heard the beer cheese soup is phenomenal but as someone with lactose intolerance I've never been able to get it. I'm always impressed by their food though. Big push for sustainably and local ingredients in their food and beer, which I think is awesome. Also can't beat the $1 Fatty Wagon to the games downtown. GLB is always a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Never heard of this beer until I moved up to Akron and man am I glad I did. They have a big variety and truly take the time out to try new tastes. Basic selection but big on flavor. I recommend the Porter and Golden Lager, as usual Pale Ale is always good too.   If you're a beer drinker (obviously are if you're reading this) you'll appreciate the tour of the facilities. They explain the process in a brief 45 min tour with 25 cent tastings. They also place a big emphasis on lessening their environmental impact. Cool story with a great taste behind it. A must visit in Cleveland."}
{"text":"You gonna love the French fries of this place. The burgers are delicious but the french fries are incredible."}
{"text":"The beer selection and taste was 4-star, but between the wait, the heavy, mediocre food, and the crowded table with little room for our coats and purses, you could probably do better within a two-block radius.  The pretzel wasn't even warm, and the Stilton soup that doubles as a dip was grainy.  The tater tots were tasty - huge amount of food - and my friend's ramen (more noodles than broth) looked unexpectedly good.  The brat with pierogies was just okay, though, and we decided to skip out on dessert."}
{"text":"Accidentally made a tour reservation here. I was able to cancel the reservation but was not able to get a refund. Why? They were not out any money. Poor way to run a business."}
{"text":"I wasn't able to sample the beer due to dietary restrictions, but they did have a nice selection of wines by the glass for me.  My husband enjoyed several of the beers he purchased. We were seated quickly and our waitress was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was better than your standard pub fare and I enjoyed my fish and chips and salad immensely.  My husband felt the price was too high for seemingly average food, but the overall experience was such that I would definitely come back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Celebration Ale, come on! It's a celebration.... (insert Kool & the Gang theme here)"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite buildings in Cleveland, the history of this place speaks to everything that I love but the service is terrible. I felt completely unwanted and was never even offered a beer (pretty strange for a \"brewery\") the quality of the food has gone down tremendously. For a place that I talked up for days, I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Treated like royalty!!! The Tour guide was fantastic and very funny she was right on the punch lines. We loved it. Thank you very much"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, decent beer. I find most of their beer is a little too malty for my taste, but they have some really great one-off options that are only available there. Their burgers are great, pierogies are better, and their pizza is a great deal during happy hour (it's basically a better version of a bar pizza, with much, much better ingredients). Overall, it's not the best option on W. 25th, but also not the worst--just avoid Saturdays when it becomes tourist central..."}
{"text":"I want crazy about the beer. the outdoor seating is nice, but many other places in a few blocks have that, too."}
{"text":"It's clear why Great Lakes Brewing has established itself as one of the larger Midwest brewing companies. Their HUGE! The brewpub is cool, starting with the classic sign above the door, the wood floors, plenty of bar space, and a few of different places to sit. Across the street is their brewery, where tours are held.   I've always liked Great Lakes beer, but I've never been blown away by what they come up with. Their like a smaller Sam Adam's brewery. On my visit, it was same as usual, beer that I was happy enough to drink but not craving another.   We had their Pub Bites to start. Loved em'. Especially their tartar sauce. The Edmund Fitzgerald batter was nice and heavy. My friend and I shared their Italian Market Pizza and Old World Burger. The meat on the pizza was not as \"Italian\" as I've come to expect. Although I'm a cured meat/charcuterie snob. The pizza wasn't cooked completely as well, needed about 8 more minutes to crisp up the crust and brown the cheese. The burger was also just OK, the patty was overcooked. Although, my friend put the order in for the burger and I don't remember how he asked for it prepared.   All in all, my experience at GLBC was left flat. I had high expectations because of their devotion to craft beer and their local farmers. While the beer has always been good, but not great for me, I was sorely disappointed with their entrees. However, I think it could have just been a case of not ordering the right options.   I'll give them another shot next time I'm in Cleveland. Probably check out the tour and order recommended items, freshest products, or maybe just focus on apps and other small items."}
{"text":"I want to give Great Lakes a 5 but it's always so congested, at least when I go. I love all the different beers and I even buy people Great Lakes stuff for Christmas. I even own one of their buckets. But i never feel comfortable when I'm in there. Like there isn't enough space or something. Either way Edmund Fitzgerald #thatisall"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this place and to be honest I didn't see it. The place was dead on a Saturday night both upstairs and downstairs. The place is small in the bar area but lots of seating inside and outside. The place is cozy but I wouldn't come here again bcs there are a lot of other places within walking distance that were better."}
{"text":"The tour was awesome and the 4 tasters were amazing! Our guide was super funny and knew so much! Can't wait to take the tour again!"}
{"text":"Excellent brewery restaurant to visit and eat. I stayed nearby and walked to this restaurant for a late night bite. They served up some excellent beer that I'd never seen out in stores, and the food was so tasty. I had sausage with a side of red cabbage and potato cakes. Yum!  The sausage had just the right amour of salt to accompany the moist and very flavorful sausage and red cabbage. It brought back many good memories of visiting Germany. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The granddaddy of Cleveland microbreweries has settled into a sort of complacency as of late, providing nothing that other (many, many) new kids of the block can't provide in spades, choosing instead to continue representing itself as, in essence, your old man's version of a local brewery. While this reliability is surely a comfort to some, a pronounced lack of overall daring, coupled with a saddening absence of vegetarian options, prevents GLBC from attaining the level of excellence its esteemed legacy would no doubt seem, at first glance, to afford it. The beer is masterfully brewed (and accounts for the 4 star rating on its own), it probably goes without saying, but chances never seem to be taken with the flavor profiles anymore. Not that I necessarily crave a chocolate habanero stout brewed in bourbon barrels and flavored with hibiscus, but resting on one's laurels (dortmunder, conway's, various ipas and red ales) seems a dangerous proposition in such a saturated market. Grievances re: a somewhat depleted sense of adventure having been aired, however, let us note that the staff at this locale are nothing if not polite, helpful, and irresistibly sharp on their recommendations. It is just a shame that the boozy microcosm they tend has seemingly lost its once so vital spark, glossy new labels notwithstanding."}
{"text":"We stayed in Ohio for only 3 days and ate dinner here twice! The beer, obviously, is what lured us in but we got so much more.... Not being a beer drinker, I enjoyed some sips of Elliot Ness and Burning River but ordered myself a glass of wine from a decent list. The food was exceptional. They have their own farm in Bath, OH and grow as many vegetables as they can there. They had a basil-citrus salad dressing made with all of their farm veggies and it was to die for. The Roasted Beet Salad was delicious and I ordered the Vegetarian Muffaleta the second night that was also great. My boyfriend also enjoyed pretzel-crusted chicken and a chicken spinach pizza that he enjoyed very much. Everything was so fresh, and the portions were just right. You do get what you pay for: local, organic ingredients. Great Lakes is a very environmentally friendly company and I totally dig that. The service was also very good, and the servers were friendly and helpful. We sat outside both nights and the patio seating environment is lovely. Definitely will be back here!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great brew pub with awesome beer and food and a great atmosphere.  The only downside is that it's really popular and can be crowded sometimes so you have to wait for a table and it can get a little loud.  I like how they have a beer flight option so you can sample the different beers.  As for food, I've tried both their burgers and the mac n cheese which were both excellent.  And you can buy 6-packs or growlers to go as well in their shop.  Definitely a favorite spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Last night I attended \"Beer School\" at the Great Lakes Brewery. In addition to their fabulous restaurant and pub they have an entire production facility and Symposium which we had the privilege of touring during class. Our tour guide, Sarah and her accomplice, also Sarah were so fun and knowledgeable about how the beer is made, the GLB zero waste efforts and all things Cleveland related to the naming of their beer lineup.   We sampled several brews, learned about IBU's and ABV as well as the difference between ales and lagers.  Not to fear, we toned our experience with giant soft pretzels, mustard and cheeses in the Symposium. Holy Moses White Ale was my favorite glass of suds. There were laughs and fun all night as we made new friends and took home some pretty cool swag. The evening was rounded out by a visit to the pub where I ordered the Stilton Beer Cheese Soup, of course. Beer glasses and T-shirt's were our take home swag This was a great experience  Highly recommend!!!! Thanks GLB!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place would of gave it 5 stars but they ran out of does us Irish ale in tap. The food was good . Especially liked the fish nuggets.long wait times put that was ok had a drink while I waited. No seats at any of the bars. Main floor was crowded elbow to elbow. Basement bar more room to stand around. Will go their again wish there was a location closer to akron.besides the airport."}
{"text":"As a native Clevelander, I make it a point to visit GLBC almost every time I'm in town. Great Lakes has been a source of Cleveland pride since 1986, despite having a beer named \"Burning River\". Their beer is full of flavor, high quality, and consistent every time. More recently, they have begun to distribute to more places, and within the past year, even to Virginia, where I currently reside. The actual brewpub is located in a the trendy Ohio City and is right across from the historic West Side Market.  Since GLBC is so awesome, be prepared to wait for a long time to dine in the brewpub. They have a great outdoor patio, and I love to spend the night out there in the summer. In the winter, things get really crazy around the holidays and with less seating, I feel like the wait time is even longer. I have had several things on the menu and always leave very full and satisfied. The tasting flight that is offered has very generous pours and will leave you feeling good.  On my last visit, we went for brewery tour. Tours are $5, and they are held every Friday and Saturday, and reservations can be made on their website. They now begin inside their new Beer Symposium, which welcomes you with an impressive backdrop of beer bottles. You step inside to the left, check in at the bar, and receive four wooden tokens for beer tasting. The tour begins there with a video about the history of the brewery--we missed much of it because the older gentleman tour guide wasn't able to get the audio to work. Then you are led around the corner to the actual brewery. I have been on at least ten brewery tours, and this was no different from the rest. The brewery is huge and always operating, and the tour guide stopped in several locations where he couldn't be heard over the machinery. We were led upstairs to the Rockefeller Room, where they hold private events, and got the opportunity to cash in our tokens at the bar. They didn't offer as many types of beer up there as they did in the Beer Symposium. When exit back into the brewery, they have an impressive high-tech setup upstairs, and I saw the biggest bag of hops ever! You return to the Beer Symposium, where you are able to use the rest of your tokens. Overall, the whole thing took about an hour and was an enjoyable experience.  If you are from Cleveland or planning a visit, you should definitely add GLBC to your list!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch this week, and it was just under whelming.  I ordered my burger medium rare, when our food came out, 20 minutes later, it was the wrong burger. The server apologized and after about 15 minutes the right one came out, it was over cooked and all around one of the worst burgers I've ever had in my life. The pretzel roll was VERY hard, the burger was dry and it has so much of a charred flavor I couldn't taste anything else on it, it covered the onions strings and BBQ sauce. The pirogies were the saving grace of our trip, they were fantastic. My husband enjoyed both beers he sampled but not enough to order a larger size."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to this place, though honestly no one ever raved about it to me. I ended up there on a Monday night, which was calm, and on a Saturday night, which was wild.   I don't drink beer, so I can't say anything other than my friends loved it. The food was not bad, considering I was nervous after reading some of the reviews here. We tried every single one of the pizzas. For being made in a thin crust style, it was not very crispy and ended up drooping with all the toppings. But taste was definitely there!  My friends and I also ended up getting the calamari, which unfortunately I don't even remember what it tasted like. So, it must have been subpar."}
{"text":"Great Lakes is one of the better brew pubs I've been to. Anytime work brings me to Cleveland I make sure to stop in. For the great quality of the food, their prices are very reasonable. The last time I went I got the mac and cheese, tater tots, and the amber ale. With tax and tip it was $35.  The waiter said his favorite thing on the menu was mac and cheese so I got it and I may have found a new favorite myself. Very flavorful without being too rich. The taters tots are classic housemate tater tots, more like a hash brown ball fried.  Previous time I'd been here on a weekend and it is obviously noisy as it's a brewpub on a weekend. This past time was on a Monday evening and it was a nice chill vibe in the indoor/outdoor beer garden with a live acoustic singer."}
{"text":"Great Lakes brewing company is well know to those who live in the Mid-west, but it's a shame that it's not all over the U.S. They have a great selection of all different types of beers. I especially enjoyed their Amber ale and their Christmas ale when it is in season. It's a great seat yourself atmosphere for the outside patio."}
{"text":"4 almost 5 stars.  Their Oktoberfest knocked my socks off: rich, smooth, and delicious.  A great Fall beer that makes an impression.  Cleveland does beer right. thumbs up!"}
{"text":"In-cred-ible! You have to get the cheddar-Stilton soup. But you will also probably pass out. It's soooo good. We came on a nice spring evening and waited for a table outside. We were seating in the beer garden, which to me was actually inside, but whatever. The IPAs and pale ales were really good."}
{"text":"I've been to 27 countries on 4 continents, was a former brewer in a small brewery and worked for a major US craft brewery, but nothing compares to Great Lakes Brewing Company. The Dortmunder Gold is by far the most superior beer I've ever had in my life. With all the beer craze, GLBC has always stuck to what it knows and continued to produce amazing quality beer and a nearly unmatched consistency. It can sometimes be a little crowded, but I say grow up, grab a beer, and make new friends!"}
{"text":"Shrimp & Grits (South) & Great Lakes Beer (Cleveland)...i'm in.  This is a very good option when you are in Ohio City and I am excited at the success that Great Lakes Brewery is having.  The beer is always solid...they are good at what they do although I would like to see them develop some more offerings.  The food at the bar is good, but I typically just stick to the shrimp and grits with a pint (or two) and go home and sleep.    Good job"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any beer at Great Lakes Brewery. My personal favorites are the Edmund Fitzgerald and the ever popular Christmas Ale. Perfectly spiced and brewed beers along with some seriously delicious pub food on par with that of any major city in the states- there's a reason Great Lakes can be found at nearly every bodega in any city in the Midwest or the East Coast. Enjoy, and drink here often."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun to go to just because of the atmosphere and the area in Cleveland. While the food is ok, I really liked the dessert and drinks they had there."}
{"text":"The beer: Some of my favorite brews. I spend 10 months a year dreaming about Christmas Ale. The standard Great Lakes variety pack is a go-to crowd - and me - pleaser.  The restaurant: Delicious. I only had the pleasure of dining here once, and it was about two years ago, so I have no freakin' clue what I ate, but I know it was delicious, and accompanied by a glass of fresh-from-the-keg Christmas Ale... and a case or four of Christmas Ale accompanied me back to Columbus,"}
{"text":"My family and I went here tonight for dinner. I had never been and they suggested it; so I was down.  My dad and I walked in (half our party) and sat down. The waiter immediately came over and starting chatting us up about the beers and apps. I went with a dortmunder and my dad got one of the seasonal beers.   We also ordered some apps; the sausage plate and the pretzels. Both of them were good. Standard.   When the rest of our party arrived we opted for the flight of beers; which was 11 3 oz samples of the beers. This was awesome and reasonably priced at $16. Highly recommend this option. Especially if you are with a few people it works out nicely.   For dinner I got the bratwurst and pierogie plate. So so good. The brats were huge. And the pierogies we delicious. Cheddar and potato. Super soft and fried to perfection.   For dessert the waiter talked me into the bread pudding (not something very hard to do) normally I do not like bread pudding, but this time I am so happy I got it. Probably the best bread pudding I have ever put in my mouth. Super soft, super moist, and it had hand whipped cream on it. SOLD!   Good experience."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going to the Great Lakes Brewing Company for a tour, stop reading now and go make a reservation for the tour. We went on a whim that day and there were no tours to be had! So this is strictly a review of the restaurant. If it is any indication of the quality of the brewery, I will definitely have to visit again!  Make your way to the rustic GLBC and you'll find that it has the tried and true tavern feeling to it. The dining area is somewhat small but nicely arranged with an ample amount of lighting and tasteful decor. You'll be surrounded by wooden fixtures and brewing equipment that adds to the cozy ambiance. You want warm, heart-touching food? The setting is right!  The service is also friendly. We had a knowledgeable waiter who wasn't afraid to make some small recommendations. I'm a fan of GLBC brews so I wanted to know what could be had at the source. The TAP menu presented all the favorites and some specialties. I usually go with ales, but I couldn't resist the Blackout Stout, with a high ABV, it is smooth and delicious-- complete with chocolatey undertones. The Christmas Ale is always good too, especially fresh.  The food, is on point. It's hard to say with so much variety in the menu but the Killbuck Valley Mushroom pizza was perfect to be split by two. The Alder Kase bleu cheese jumps out and kicks you in the face while the garlic oil nurtures and soothes the pain that is so good. You'll want to finish it, but then you can't have some later?  This could have easily been a three star if I was critical about it. However with the combination of a warm ambiance, savvy and satisfying service, and fare that hit the spot, Great Lakes Brewing Company is going to make you feel right at home. Go ahead, have a seat. Have a drink, unwind."}
{"text":"Always great food, great beer and great service.  One of my favorite places to eat.  Taking some friends there on 12/12 that have never been before. Excited to share one of the best in Cleveland with them!"}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and asked our server Derek what we should order, we had the Sausage appetizer, Perogie side, Mac n Cheese, and Pretzel Crusted Chicken, amazing meal!!!! Everything is made fresh and sourced from area vendors, the beer was great and the service from Derek top notch! Right down to the Bread Pudding Dessert Derek suggested, couldn't be happier with the meal and service and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Fun place to stop if you are new to the city and in a good location. Not a big fan of their food though."}
{"text":"With all the breweries and bottle houses emerging in Cleveland, I must say, GLBC was the founding father of the new craft beer scene to Cleveland. Many of the older breweries shut their doors before 1900, and Great Lakes kept the beer a-flowing! For this, I am very thankful. The first beer they brewed, Dortmunder, is my go-to craft beer. This brewery really is a landmark in Cleveland- people from out of town know of the GLBC beers and want to come here. Plus, they support local farmers and strive to improve their community. They host \"beer school,\" brewery tours, trivia, and educational lectures for local colleges.   The tour of the brewery is free. I thought the guides were knowledgeable and entertaining. Just be sure to bring quarters for beer samples at the end!   GLBC food at their brewpub definitely takes a backseat to their beer.  It's not bad, but there are so many delicious dining options in Ohio City, I find myself opting to eat elsewhere and saving GLBC for drinks. I respect that many of their beers are incorporated in the food, but let us taste the beer in the food!  Plus, the noodles were practically dry when I ordered the mac & cheese- not the cheesy goodness I was expecting.   The service varies. One weeknight, I stopped for drinks with a friend and we ended up going to the bar for drinks and snacks because our waitress never came to our table. Another time, we had an impromptu large family gathering on a Saturday night- like 30ish people- and they accommodated us with great service!   Conclusion: You like beer? You like Cleveland?  You'll enjoy Great Lakes."}
{"text":"Let me start with the beer.  The beer was much better than expected. I had the sampler, which ranged from \"approachable\" to a very flavorful high grav the Glockenspiel.  I would highly recommend a visit if you are not from the area (and if you are) to try the tasty brews.  We had dinner here on Saturday night (7/12) and it was very crowded. We had an hour+ wait.  The quoted time was 30-45 minutes, which was similar with other restaurants in the area.  This was following an Indians game with many in the area following the game.  With all that said, when we were seated, the service was good and attentive.  The food was delivered faster than expected for how busy they were at the time.  The food was fresh and very good.  The pretzels were great.  Mac and Cheese with a twist was a hit with one of the teenagers and a burger was complimented by the other.    Other than the wait, an overall very good experience."}
{"text":"Decent food, better beer and a great bar that has great bartenders and a good feel. It's a great place to get a beer before a tribe game or a night cap!"}
{"text":"We have been hearing about this place for years by our relatives. We finally made it out to Cleveland from Chicago for a couple of days and decided to check this place out. So glad we did!  We had reservations to tour the brewery at 5, so we had an early dinner before that. We had a couple of apps (stuffed peppers, pretzels) that were okay. Our dinners, though, were delish. I had the mac n cheese, which was divine. My husband had the pretzel crusted chicken, which he loved. My husband had one of the IPAs and he loved it too. We shared our desserts- bread pudding and gingerbread ice cream made with their Christmas Ale. I think that ice cream was the best ice cream I've EVER had.  Which leads us to the Christmas Ale. Amazing. On our tour the guide explained that they use honey and spices to make it, so it's on the sweeter side and sooooooo good. We bought a six pack to go and that was not enough. I have been searching Chicagoland for it with no luck- but at least I will know for next year to look early!!! Seriously, my life is complete with Christmas Ale. And I'm not much of a beer drinker!  The tour was also great- we had a gentleman guide who was funny and informative. At the end you get to sample (although by Ohio law you have to pay for samples) a few beers and hang out.  I will definitely be going again when we visit family."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu, the homemade veggie burger is the best in town."}
{"text":"Great place as always.  Great service.  The tater tots are excellent and of course the beer is good."}
{"text":"My wife and i were on vacation in Cleveland and decided to try out the local flagship beer. Great Lakes.  Our server was awesome, super nice, and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side salad substitute for the fries.  I got a solid IPA to match the beer as well.  The pulled pork sandwich was real good and had a slice of cheese on it, which was a great touch. Super juicy and great sauce.  The side salad was really good for an extra $2. Lots of fresh lettuce, could have used some better croutons, but that is nit-picking.  I had a second beer and would definitely come back here if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I will cheat a little bit and strictly rate the beer, not the actual brewpub, which I never managed to visit when I lived in Cleveland.  But the beer is worthy of a 5-star rating, as it is simply fantastic all across the board. Coming from Philadelphia (which other than Denver is mircobrew central), I can say with all honesty that Great Lakes would beat almost all of them (Dogfish Head is still the one ring to rule them all, though). Seriously, they are all excellent. Burning River Pale Ale tops the list of the regulars, and the Christmas Ale tops the entire list.   Even if I just got a sixpack at Giant Eagle, I found it to always be fresh and tasty. Any bar I ever went to in Cleveland that had Great Lakes was one of my favorites, and I always ordered Great Lakes. Always. I miss Great Lakes. Its one reason I will return to Cleveland one day, if only to get totally plowed on beer."}
{"text":"Um...Of course I had to check this place out. I'm a beer head and it was calling my name.  We had lunch here on our trip to Cleveland. Food was great--not wonderful--but decently priced for what you got. I'd say it's worth it because the beer is so tasty. Plus, the day was beautiful and so it was definitely a plus being able to sit outside in the sun and rev up my Vitamin D production.   I don't remember the name of my beer, but it was the smoked pale it. Wow. Really hit the spot. Faint lingering of smokiness, but other than that its all good beeriness. Not too hoppy either for your anti-hoppers.   We ordered a fish and chips and a sausage sampler plate to share. Wonderful with the beer."}
{"text":"I love the brewpub. I'm not so fond of the gift shop. Let me explain.  The brewpub has four distinct sections. One is a cool, dark, polished bar with small seating nooks and maximized standing room. One is a bright, open, large-tabled room for big groups that want to eat. One is a spacious patio on a quiet city street. Another is underground; I didn't check that one out.  Anyway, the beer selection is wonderful, with many brews you can't get in stores. I'm a big fan of the aptly named Blackout Stout.  Our server, Kevin, also was the bartender. He amazingly kept up with the droves of people who appeared around 6:30 p.m. and seemed to have an eye on everyone in the room. He knew when I needed a beer, when I wanted food, when I was hunting a restroom. Awesome, awesome service.  Service was decidedly not awesome in the gift shop. I think dude was (understandably) drinking. He wasn't much help when I asked about growlers, and he really seemed to want me to leave. The packaged beers were kinda' overpriced. Brews that would cost me $7 at my local shop cost $8 in the gift shop. I'm AT the brewery! How you gonna charge me more.   Food prices were pricey for Ohio but not astronomical. Most dishes run in the teens, and my calamari plate was $4 during happy hour, which lasts until 7 p.m.  Parking can be scarce, but it's not impossible and certainly doesn't justify using the nearby pay lot. If you don't mind walking a block or two, you'll be OK. After 6:30 p.m., lots of parking opens up as Cleveland's no-stopping rule is lifted."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with GLBC. Simply, they are the best to me.  They make so many good quality beers that they are my go-to brewery in most occasions.  Of their \"everyday\" beers, Edmund Fitzgerald is their best.  However, the seasonal beers is what makes this place great. Lake Erie monster, blackout stout (don't even get me started on BABOS - maybe my favorite beer of all time), Nosferatu, or Christmas ale are all great choices.  Great Lakes just flat out knows how to make beer."}
{"text":"We took a tour of the brewery. Followed by dinner. Lots of fun. But need to reserve for tour in advance.   The tour was fun. Four five ounce beers for five dollars. Your choice of available beers.   We had the charcuterie board, the Local and Fresh, as an appetizer. I had the old style burger. Very tasty. Piled high with bacon. And the Porter barbecue sauce was great.   Atmosphere was fun. The Ohio City area had a lot happening. We will definitely come back this summer."}
{"text":"Good food and good beer. Can't wait for Christmas ale season!"}
{"text":"I had a great time on the Brewery tour.  While I should say that GLBC is not my absolute favorite beer, I did enjoy the history of the building and more importantly the specialty beers they brew in house for the taproom located across the street from where they do the tours.  Book a tour and go!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this joint since I am from out of town and had never had Great Lakes beer ever.     Beer is kinda meh.   Food was pretty decent though and service was super.   Not much to really report. I would skip this place if you are coming from out of town and are looking for decent beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with a friend on my most recent trip to Cleveland.  The beer was great! the service excellent and the food better than I had expected.  I had a Walleye filet that was perfect. so perfect in fact that when I returned to San Francisco I got online, searched out Walleye and found a place that ships fresh frozen fillets.  What an amazing piece of fish! I am hooked, too bad the fish itself is so expensive to ship to Ca.  I'll definitely be coming back here every time I'm in Cleveland.  To enjoy the Walleye and a pint of Belgian Triple Dog Dare!"}
{"text":"Great dinner and great beer.  The Stilton Cheddar Ale Soup (Made with Dortmunder Gold Lager) which was amazing.  The Stuffed Anaheim Peppers (stuffed with Chorizo sausage, cheddar and Chihuahua cheeses, roasted tomato sauce) was a delicious appetizer. For my entree, I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli (Ohio City Pasta ravioli filled with butternut squash, sauteed with brown butter, Swiss chard, walnuts) which was also amazing. For beers, I had the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter (Bittersweet chocolate-coffee taste and bold hop presence) and the Black Racer (a pub exclusive beer; A dark ale with malty notes and bold hop presence), both of which are amazing dark beers. Would definitely go back here next I am in in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm a native Clevelander transplanted to San Francisco. Despite the 8+ breweries in SF and the dozens all over the Bay Area, I still crave GLBC beers. Stopped in the brewhouse last night for some Nosferatu and immediately fell in love. What a fantastic Imperial Red. Tops Red Rocket Ale from Bear Republic in my book any day.  Sitting at the bar, the service was \"good\". My GF and I shared the sausage plate which was very very good. Afterwards, I had the Altbier which though didn't knock my socks off, was still quite good.  Whenever I come home for a visit, a trip to the bar where Eliot Ness once sat is always a must. Now GLBC only needs to start distributing to the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Oh, Great Lakes, you've been a part of my life ever since high school as the aroma of hops and barley wafted through the air during PE and as I walked past you to school. You even embraced environmental sustainability with me and local foods before it entered into the American mainstream mid 2000s.  I've had the food 3-4 times over the past 2 years and nothing had ever been memorable (good or bad); I can't even remember what I had. Service was all right.   The beers have been written about ad nausem here. I'll just add that there's usually one or 2 seasonal brews that are never bottled and their beer selection in their banquet room is limited with only 2 or 3 taps.    Holding a great conversation while drinking with the background of the Ohio City Neighborhood is a great experience and one of my favorite places in Cleveland to do so.  It's quiet enough on the patio to have good conversations without blaring music in the background.  There's two adjacent patios: an uncovered with a view of Market Street, a small cobblestone road. In the background is the West Side Market and a pocket park with a couple mature trees, amid a bed of concrete and local art. Unfortunately, the pocket park will soon be demolished and renovated. Yes, the pocket park, could be more aesthetically pleasing and there's the occasional homeless and mentally ill person there but I've always felt safe down there. The pocket park, WSM, and high pedestrian traffic combine to make a lovely background for your conversation. Additionally, the building is north of the patio so the sun isn't in our eyes as you sit. The crowd is mostly yuppies and often older, 30-50.   My only quibble is that they aren't open on Sundays.   Very high 4 stars, just improve the food.   PS - sorry Tara, you were a great server, and cute too, soo sorry I forgot to leave you a tip last time :("}
{"text":"I think the consensus here is more or less accurate -- beer is very good to excellent, food is fair to good. I always like to the try the beers which are only available in the pub and not in bottles."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. While on our annual vacation to Ohio, we visited Great Lakes Brewery after stopping for some goodies at the Westside Market. While the GLBC giftshop, resturant, outdoor seating, and brewpub were beautiful, the rest of the experience was horrendous. The service was unorganized and unfriendly. We got a few flights and tried all 11 brews on the brewlist, having tasted over 400 beers, 9 out of the 11 were some of the worst beers I have ever drank. Think they use the Cleveland Tap water for their brews. The Oktoberfest has a Sulfidic taste upfront and the Cleveliner Weisse had a sulfidic taste upfront and in the finish. The Market Garden Brewery a block away was hands down a much better choice!!!"}
{"text":"Food Good, Service Okay, Beer Good (and the best damn Christmas Ale in the land!), Can be overcrowded at times  I love coming to this place. My only hope is that its not too overcrowded, which it can be at times. The pierogis are pretty on point, and I will never turn down a Christmas Ale. A must if in the area! Definitely will continue being regulars here :)"}
{"text":"A cleveland favorite of mine.   Great in both location and environment. Outdoor seating. Across from the West side market.   An old favorite of the great Elliot Ness:) Hard to argue with the experts.  Did I mention the beer!??!"}
{"text":"This place gets one star for keeping the beer cold.  I was a out of towner visiting Cleveland for the first time and heard great things about this place. The ONLY reason we went there was for their Xmas ale. THEY WERE OUT!!! How lame!!! ITS A BREWERY!!!!!!  THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE!!! SERVICE EVEN WORSE!!!!  We had a party of 13 and everyone hated their meal.  I had a cheeseburger and fries.. which came out to the table cold.  I mean really...... its just beer. Ive had better in SoCal.  Dont even bother with this place!!!"}
{"text":"The patio is lovely.  The beer is smashing (especially the non hops Gilgamash...holy wow).  The food is solid, especially since they source many ingredients locally.   The service is on point.   So, verdict? Grab a seat on the patio, order a local brew and some bites (shrimp tacos are a tasty choice) and revel in Great Lakes Brewing goodness.   High five to Cleveland for this gem."}
{"text":"If you want an amazing Cleveland experience where you get a chance to meet the locals, try absolutely amazing food, and drink the best beer around, then you have to go to Great Lakes Brewing Company.   I have been going here for a very long time. My family used to take us here all the time for dinner and the second I was able to drink, my husband and I take our out of town friends there every chance we get.  Headed to an Indians game? Stop by GLBC and for just $1, they will shuttle you to and from the game. It is the best thing ever.  We actually went so many years in a row with our couple friend, we were regulars with one waitress who was there 20+ years. When we found out she was moving to be with her grandkids in Oregon, we made one more trip down there to thank her for all the memories she had given us. Don't worry Mary, we will pass on your love for the bread pudding!  GLBC is a place where you will wait for a table but have such an amazing time during that wait. The bar area is great, the food is delicious, but the customer service is outstanding! Can't say enough about every aspect of this company."}
{"text":"The tour was great! Peter gave us a lot of good info and really enjoyed his humor. Will do it again."}
{"text":"Great service and drinks but the food left a lot to be desired. Got the west side ramen. Even though I got it veganized, i was disappointed in the quality.  It was served like a pasta dish, not a ramen. The broth was veggie based with chili paste added. The only veggies involved were broccoli, onion and spinach. My mom got the Cuban sandwich which she claimed wasn't hot and the bread wasn't toasted."}
{"text":"This was the first brewery on our long journey to Surly.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  I actually didn't drink anything since nothing was calling out to me.  The BF got a couple of samples however he was less than excited since everything that he wanted to try they no longer had on tap.  We didn't eat here so I can't comment on the food. All in all, if I lived in Cleveland I would probably like Great Lakes.  However, since I was just passing through, it was really unmemorable.  On the other hand I got a really cute long sleeved tee from the gift shop."}
{"text":"I loved their beer and this would probably be 4 stars but they absolutely failed at food. They couldn't do mid rare burger after 2 tries. I gave up. Their cocktails aren't worth it (cherry vanilla smash tastes like watered down bourbon) but the beer is great. I would say this isn't for food. It's for great beer.  Edit: they gave me a $15 gift card to compensate so I'm giving them a star for that and saying that it is much appreciated. Edit 2: with a beer your and a few free beers they earned themselves another star and a comment about their friendliness from me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a bustling Saturday in Ohio City. Had without a doubt the best Cuban pork sandwich I've ever tasted, and yummy seasoned fries. Washed it down nicely with a Market St. Hefweissen and an Independence Ale.  Great Lakes, you do us proud. As a fan of the GL Christmas Ale, Dortmunder Gold, Elliot Ness Lager, and Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, I am also reminded as to why I love e food there as well. Fresh, creative and delicious, all with a lively urban vibe."}
{"text":"For a local brewery the food is great!  We call it pub/bar food.  Would love  to visit more often, but its often hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Had a great time, good laughs, and even better beer!! Well worth the time if you're in town. I'd do it again. This is for the brewery tour."}
{"text":"Beer was amazing ! Our waiter was very fast and precise . Burger was good and pulled pork was great . The beer was so fresh . I  definitely a huge fan of glbc"}
{"text":"Great beer but the Bar Staff is lacking a welcoming and friendly attitude.  I can go to any other bar for a better experience.  Remember, the customer expects a certain experience.  It was lacking tonight and during past visits."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  Great ambience, great beers, and they support local and organic small crop farmers.  Unfortunately, while the service was great and the items my dining companions ordered were great, my burger was so salty it actually felt like I was getting a 'salt burn'.  Yeah, that salty.  And I normally love salt.  It was, frankly, inedible. Didn't have time to send it back, as we had tix to the Indians game that night.  Will go back at some point, as everthing else we ordered was really good.  I'd notch this up to a fluke, rather than the norm."}
{"text":"Awesome beer. I wish I could get it out in CT. I tried to go on the tour one time, but my friends and I couldn't figure out where we were supposed to go in. It was ok though."}
{"text":"We had the beer sampler and the local fresh plate. Both were enough for 2 for supper. Great service, food and ambiance. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great beer, AMAZING fries! Love this place.   Could probably have a bit more vegetarian options though... the black bean burger is bland and too mushy."}
{"text":"We had reservations for a large party.  Service was good but incredibly slow.  We had trouble getting menus, silverware, second drinks and the check.  Waitress just had too many tables.  Food was unremarkable.   Try a different place for large parties; this place made it too difficult."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland for a night last month and managed to stop at the Great Lakes Brewing Company for a quick drink.  Nice atmosphere and the staff were friendly.  The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter was great.  Worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I feel like sometimes I take places like this for granted.  This is never more apparent when I go home for the holidays.  Every year I head to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and spend time with family, friends, and random drunks at the bars.  Each year I find myself heading up to the local grocery store for my beer / liquor stock-up for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  That's right, my family whoops it up on the Eve and starting off early with some homemade Baily's the next day.  When scouring over my options I always stop over the Great Lakes selection and pick up a couple 6 packs, usually Christmas Ale, Elliot Ness, and Dortmunder.  And again, every year like clockwork, I am standing in my moms kitchen explaining to someone the layout of the bar / restaurant in Cleveland, and how everyone raves over the Christmas Ale.  No doubt do I create at least one fan while I am up there, but best of all, I find myself missing the atmosphere you get while in Great Lakes BC.   It's become a Cleveland icon.  It's a must stop.  It's a terrific beer, awesome atmosphere, and best of all it's a image / memory that will make you want to, plainly said, 'be there'.    I have tried the food and its about as good as it gets for a brewery.  Burgers seem to be the hot item here.  I watched at least 12 burgers fly out of the kitchen heading down to the dungeon bar under the main restaurant, and to think I was only there for 2 beers.  The price of items in the gift shop seem, to me, a little inflated.  Best deal to me would be the collection of wall mounts showcasing the beer of choice.  I'll be back, this I promise you!"}
{"text":"The tour was fun. A nice way to spend the afternoon in Cleveland. You get four samples included in the cost of the tour."}
{"text":"Waitress was so sweet and very attentive, however our burgers were very subpar... not cooked to order. The waitress was very quick to apologize, remake the burger and take it off our bill. Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"In a situation that was a bit out of my control, I landed up here on a sweltering Summer evening with my in laws in tow. Needless to say, I wanted a beer bad.  Great Lakes Brewery has a great little location in a part of Cleveland that seemed really interesting to me (from a visitors perspective.) Granted that it was only a Wednesday evening, but the whole block was bustling, as was Great Lakes.  Once we made our way in, we were promptly greeted and I sort of drifted off to the bar as I saw three large letters that I've come to love over the last few years: IPA I waited a few minutes, grabbed the bartender's attention and more or less immediately downed the beer ignoring all of it's hoppy flavorfulness. I was so thirsty that I didn't even call the beer by it's proper name when hailing the bartender, the Commodore Perry. Since I more or less downed the first one instantly due to heat exhaustion, I took note of the flavors on my second time through; subtle hoppyness with a fruity finish. It was great.  Now, two IPAs in, it was time to grab some food. The four of us headed up stairs where we seated overlooking the patio area and the crowd below. When menus finally came around, I glanced over it and quickly realized it was standard fare. Burgers, salads, etc. I was slightly disappointed as I knew the place could do better given than their beers were great, but it's more or less to be expected knowing as their focus is obviously beer (for the time being.)   Overall, I was pretty pleased with Great Lakes Brewery. If it were just a taproom, I would give them four stars just based on the great beer, but since the food was just a little bit of a let down, there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"Disappointed in their menu and beer selections. Only a handful of beers offered, and in the winter it was only IPA's. The food wasn't great (can't expect much from a brewery) and was typical pub food that was lacking in flavor. Was hoping for more given the reputation and location. Waitress also had to ask the kitchen several times for basic questions about the menu. There are so many great places in the area, just buy their beer in the grocery store and treat yourself to someplace else you'll enjoy for a night out. **however, if you are going just for the beer, I'm sure you'll have a different experience!"}
{"text":"The Ohio City area of Cleveland, just over the Hope Memorial Bridge (right outside Progressive Field) is fantastic.  We stopped by Great Lakes for dinner and while there was a wait for seating outside, we headed down to the basement where we could get all of their beers and the full food menu.  I had the chicken mac and cheese with homemade pasta, and Mike had the pierogies.  Both were really good and honestly some of the best food we've had at a brewery.  The beers were good, too, but the food was what really stood out."}
{"text":"The bartenders and servers are all very friendly. The food is good. I'm not a fan of the beer but that is a personal preference. Clevelanders all love it, and maybe I'll acquire the taste one day."}
{"text":"The brewery tours are very informative and very entertaining at the same time. The brewpub serves amazing food as well as your favorite Great Lakes brew. I've tried the old world burger which was spectacular and paired well with the Dortmunder Gold."}
{"text":"oh great lakes if i was rating you on just your beer you'd get 5 stars.  i love your beer.  but i give the actual brew pub two stars.  the whole excitement about going to cleveland was getting to try great lakes brewery.  we were sat in the year round patio and it just sucked the fun right out of us, it was quiet, plain and boring.  our waiteress was pretty much non-existent.  the artichoke app was just, meh.  i got butternut squash raviloi which was good, but at the prices they are charging for food i would like a little atmosphere to go with it.  we did take a look at the basement pub and that was slightly more like what we were hoping the rest of the place would be like.  we wanted a lively pub what we felt like we got was ...meh."}
{"text":"This place is a train wreck when it comes to service.  The servers are full of complaints, loud talking about their environment and generally disinterested in providing even mediocre service to patrons.    Luckily this place is in an airport where folks are often limited or trapped to find food and drink, otherwise this place would go down quicker than an elevator full of big boned Alabama girls.   Walk the extra corridor, if the service doesn't let you down the poor choice of outfits will.   Happy Trails,"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere. Great neighborhood. Awesome beer. Not bad food. It's a great place to hang out. The fries are awesome.  It doesn't hurt that Christmas Ale had just been released, that it was 60 degrees in November and I was spending time with an old friend. Still, the place is very cool, it's local and who wouldn't want to taste Great Lakes brews straight from the source?"}
{"text":"We needed a table for 6 and were seated without any issues. The beer selection is very good and I liked everything that I sampled.   The food was very good and my burger was cooked exactly how I like it (very rare). Our waitress was very nice and recommended some good food choices."}
{"text":"I am reluctantly here to give this place 3 stars as much as I had hoped for better. Had this review but solely based on our beer, atmosphere, and experience, it would easily be pushing 5 stars.  We arrived after a trip to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and were hungry and thirsty for a full meal so we ordered the ramen, the vegan burger, and the nachos with chorizo. Both the vegan burger and nachos were very good and I was happy and surprised to find a vegan option on the menu at this kind of place that was actually super flavorful however, this review starts going down drastically because of the ramen.   UGH, the \"ramen\". Had I been a more proactive Yelper before visiting I would have known that the ramen is a disgrace to Japanese cuisine. Can we get a PSA that this ramen is closer to the 15 cent package from Walmart than a brothy, flavorful ramen?? We asked our server how it was and she refrained from mentioning that it was less than authentic and not would your average foodie would consider \"ramen\". Expectations did not meet reality. Anyways, we received ramen, ON A PLATE, like not in a bowl.......with barely any broth. We were honestly so confused. The overall flavor was okay but lacked the general depth of flavor of traditional ramen. My boyfriend has never sent anything back in the history of us dining together but we ended up sending it back and getting it removed from our bill. Our server was less than thrilled about accommodating this request but she inevitably did remove it. We explained to her the situation and that our expectations did not match what we received. It looks like other Yelpers have had similar reactions to this dish. If I was to make any recommendations to Great Lakes, I would remove the item or offer a heads up under the description that this item isn't what you may necessarily expect.   *Jumps off soapbox* Overall, our experience was really great and we loved the vibe inside and the pub downstairs. We came in the first place because we are extremely big fans of Great Lakes brews! I would definitely give this place another shot if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I was headed out to Cleveland for work and saw this place on the food network. I'm a sucker for a good beer cheese soup and of course beer.  I stopped in after work around 5 and the place already had a good sized crowd. I grabbed a table in the bar and the waitress was prompt and very helpful. I don't like IPAs so ordered samples of all but the IPAs. I'm a sucker for Porter's and Stouts and was not disappointed. I was also happily surprised at how good the Amber was as well! After my samples were gone, I went for a pint of the Amber!   Of course I ordered the Cheddar Stilton soup and Bratwurst with 3 pierogis. Mmmm! The soup was amazing. Nothing was overpowering just a really delicious rounded out flavors. Crackers were served on the side and I didn't even touch them. I would have licked the bowl if no one was around!  Bratwurst and pierogi were just as good. The cabbage tasted great and really elevated the pierogi.  I was so full walking out of there but man was it worth it!!!  I really wish I could these beers were available back home in Massachusetts."}
{"text":"Their Ohio City location is everything you could possibly expect an old-school Cleveland brew pub to be.  I especially love the basement area.  I tried the Big Black Smoke... Man it was good!  Perfect name for the taste.  Perfect name for the city.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Food is great, beer is great, location is nice and cozy! I brought a friend who had never been to the brewpub and we each loved our meal! The mac and cheese is FANTASTIC, and the Edmund Fitzgerald was as good as ever -- although I cannot wait for them to bring back their Blackout stout!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat at the restaurant, but toured the gift shop and walked around a bit.  The beer prices were phenomenal.  Being from further south in Ohio, they jack up the prices of Great Lakes beer by a few dollars.  Worth the trip to see family members and pick up my favorite beer!    One complaint: They don't bottle their red ale.  The Irish ale is great, but I'd love to try the red ale!  Get bottling so us central-Ohioans can get some!"}
{"text":"Good beers, great tasting room upstairs with restaurant and gift shop attached.  Down in the basement is a pub area which has more of the bar feel with more seating, and outside there are tons of tables and chairs for when the weather is nice.    More important than how good the beer was, is how great the beertender was.  He gave me some great recommendations in town for other quality breweries/craft beer places and gave me his opinion on what places to leave out of lineup.   The places he recommended were amazing, and I found my favorite place in town because of it.  I will definitely make it back here and order their beer elsewhere.  Great experience."}
{"text":"This is a classic Cleveland establishment! I've only ever came here for a drink (Christmas ale is the way to go) so I've never dined here! But it's a good atmosphere to meet friends and I would definitely bring out of towers here for a taste of Cleveland! Great Lakes is really close to other bars (like Bier Market, Market Garden, and all of the other bars around w25th.) so you could easily make a night out of it!"}
{"text":"Great place. We didn't expect it to be as nice. Cozy, fun warm place. We waited 1/2 an hour for a table. So we went downstairs to the bar for a round. It's a cozy small bar.  Got seated in the room to the right. Has a fireplace. I loved the small of a fireplace.  We had pretzels for an appetizer. Comes with two pretzels and three different mustards. Great but a little pricey. She had the Butternut Squash Ravioli. (She inhaled them btw) I could  not decide, so I had the sausage appetizer and bratwurst pierogi dinner. Was hoping to bring some home but that didn't happen!!! Too good to stop. It is deffenetly worth the two hour drive from Pgh!!! Will go again."}
{"text":"Only go here if you want great beer, good food and fun. Our party of four old friends (since childhood) came together in Cleveland because one of us just moved here and the other three needed to check out the city. So we're having fun no matter what we do. We took the GLBC brewery tour which is excellent. The brewery has a great story and history. They have clear values that they both communicate and live, so that makes it way more interesting than hops-malted barley-yeast-water. You get 4 tastes of beer on the tour, so everyone is happy. The restaurant coordinates with the tour, so despite no reservations on Saturday, our table was ready for us when the tour ended.  Good was good, service good, atmosphere good, and we had fun. Two of us had a special Walleye fish entree, two had fish and chips, all really good. The beer is excellent. Not flashy, not unique, just solid delicious beer that is great plain or paired with food. I love the names of the beers, which reflect the heritage of Cleveland/ Ohio/ Great Lakes."}
{"text":"Came to dinner on a Friday at around 8.  There was no wait, but it seemed as if all the tables were filled.  I've had GLB beers many time since about 1999, and I've enjoyed them all.  We can finally get them in PA.  I had the Mexican Lager with hibiscus which was floral, not heavy and went down smoothly.  We started with the 4 sausage sampler and the giant tater tots.  Both were so delicious and satisfying pub food.  The tots were even great heated up later on.  Went for the Stilton cheese soup and a light salad with balsamic for the meal.  The salad and dressing were typical spring mix, but tasty as expected.  The soup, though, was magnificent.  Rich, tangy, pungent...I really couldn't get enough of that cheesy fat bomb!!  The ambiance was warm and inviting pub decor.  Really like the barrel/label wall on the upper floor.  The service was excellent...she was knowledgeable and made great suggestions.  Been enjoying visiting different breweries at home and elsewhere and this was at the top of the list!"}
{"text":"Beer here! Though it takes 30 or 40 minutes for you to grab a seat during weekends, it's definitely worth visiting! My local friends took my husband and I here and we enjoyed their beer offering very much! Food is also in decent qualify. I would recommend the sausage sampler as a starter!"}
{"text":"Firstly, the tour is great- do it, you'll learn a lot and catch a buzz.  Secondly, the food has been a little hit and miss.  Super fun atmosphere, but service has been a a bit on the slow side lately, and while I wouldn't write it off completely, it wouldn't be my first choice in Ohio City, with Flying Fig, Market Garden Brewery, and Townhall a stones throw away.  The pub area does have a bit of that old beer on the floor smell, but hey maybe thats part of the charm."}
{"text":"I get really excited when I am pleasantly surprised about restaurants. This one definitely surprised me. I was in Cleveland for work, and our first group dinner was here, I expected it to be kind of a chain type place, and it was anything but. On the back of the menu it talks about their two farms where the restaurant grows its own herbs and vegetables, and then it lists all the local vendors they use and what they get from each one. It was great to see such a commitment to local food. The food at this restaurant was really good also. We started with the meat and cheese platter, which had salamis, sausages, local goat cheese, blue cheese, and an American cheese, but what was really delicious were the house-made pickled olives and onions. I could eat a whole bowl of them! I started with a beer cheese soup, and it was amazing. Not too heavy and a great runny texture like you want in a soup, but rarely find with a cheese soup. I ordered a special, and it was the wrong choice, so I won't dwell on it.  However, most of the other people I was with ordered their specialties like a pot roast sandwich or meatloaf and they all had rave reviews. I will remember this place next time I return to Cleveland. Being that it was a brewery, I brought home a growler of their beer for my husband who likes to consider himself a bit of a connoisseur, he was very happy with their Engine 20. If you like a dark beer, this one looks light, but tastes dark. (only 6 more months til I can sip my wine again!)"}
{"text":"Great place for someone with food allergies. They have an entire book to sift through to choose foods that best suit your allergy needs. They do use latex but have other options for latex allergies. Beyond that, there is truly nothing better than a Christmas Ale on tap."}
{"text":"This is kind of a standard microbrewery, except that it's HUGE and has a large number (11, when I last visited) of beers.  Lots of different rooms, including a large outdoor seating area, give many different atmospheres to choose from - my favorite is the cave feel of the downstairs pub.  The plentiful clean bathrooms are always a plus also."}
{"text":"as a brewery, great lakes is perhaps one of my favorites.  and i can't wait for the holy moses to come back.  best. summer. beer. ever.  but as a brewpub, i was incredibly disappointed.  how could a brewery with such individuality create an environment so devoid of personality?    everything else, from the decor, to the food, to the service, was so...mediocre.  i understand that you offer some of the best beer in the midwest.  but why rest solely on that fact?  why not try something creative with your food?  why not offer an environment that is unique, interesting, or exciting?  why not hire people that are friendly, outgoing, engaging?  well, at least now i know to just stick to their beer.  at least they put some effort into that."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Great Lakes beers.  A wide selection, and so much of it is so tasty!  Edmund Fitzgerald is one of my all-time faves.  The Brewpub is really pretty mediocre, though.  Dank, dark atmosphere, and not in a good way.  Bar food that just falls flat, with very little to offer a vegetarian other than fries and giant pretzels (the sauce for which is singularly disgusting, btw).  If you love their beer, it's worth stopping in once, but there are far better places to both eat and drink in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Beer is excellent, but the food is WAY overpriced for what you get. $14 for a dry pretzel bun burger and 12 French fries is ridiculous. Definitely try the Christmas Ale if it's on tao.Try to park on Lorain St if you can find a meter, and if you do get a table, try to grab one outside or down in the pub to better avoid the chance of being seated next to a screaming toddler."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer. Definitely a great place to stop to log beers on untapped. We ordered the full taste sampler and some sammiches. Our server wasn't the most cheerful, but he was efficient when you got his attention."}
{"text":"While this place is famous for the beer be very careful when deciding to do dinner here. Ask them if the kitchen is behind before you stay for dinner. Waited 125 min for a cheeseburger."}
{"text":"For the basement pub only...  Came here on a weekend around lunch time to kill some time before a brunch reservation across the street. Upstairs was packed but luckily there's a full service bar downstairs. Can get beer and the food just the same as upstairs (I believe).   Got two flights trying out mostly their experimental and seasonal stuff. I'll be honest, I've never been a huge great lakes kind of guy but I really enjoyed the experience and service. 4 stars for that. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Don't go here for the food. My husband and I both had burgers. I had the Brewhouse and my husband had the Old World. The burgers were DRY and tasteless. How hard is it to make a good burger? Salt and pepper goes a long way. The beer was just ok. The service was slow and we waited for about 30 minutes to get a table. It was disappointing. We were going to choose one of the other breweries around the area but they didn't have kids menus."}
{"text":"I have one complaint about my experience here, and it is a minor one.  The beer?  Fantastic.  The service?  I was in a group of 20, and the servers handled us amazingly well.  Food was solid - not over the moon, but good.  The outdoor patio we sat on was nice - the whole experience was great.  The one complaint (and it is minor) was that the pint glasses they sell in the on-site store are ridiculously overpriced.  Like, bat shit crazy high priced.  But given all the other pluses, hard to hold that one small thing against them.  I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in a while. Well cooked, nice choice in cheese and the fries were super delicious. mmmmhmmmm"}
{"text":"I was just thinking about the content of my review for Great Lakes Brewing Co. while on my way home tonight, and was just going to write  \"Two words:  Christmas. Ale.\"  Though Susan S. beat me to that one, I stand by it.  :)  For real.  Tasty beer with spices and honey, enjoyed after working 30 hours over the past... 64, I think...?  Whatever, I'm a performer, not a mathematician.  And also exhausted.  Anyway, you go, Christmas Ale.  Yep."}
{"text":"A staple of the Cleveland Beer Scene. I am a fan of their beer & particularly enjoy their Christmas Ale, Edmund Fitzgerald, & Oatmeal Stout in the winter months, but for some reason I wouldn't say any of their beers are my first choice. I feel their beer is a bit lacking of new creativity found in newer microbreweries around the area.   I had dinner here recently following a tour of the brewery & had a fantastic time, however. The burger was good & tater tots very big & delicious like nothing I've had before. Their beers are great in-house, the brewpub is fun, and they rotate a bunch of exclusives you can't get elsewhere.  If you're from out of town & like beer, DEFINITELY check it out or if you're local grab some friends & hit it up for a great happy hour or pregame spot (the Fatty Wagon shuttles you to and from the Q & Progressive Field)."}
{"text":"Tops. Great Lakes Brewing Company knows what they're doing, and has been as successful as it is for good reason."}
{"text":"I came just for lunch and fresh off the worlds smallest plane - my legs needed a stretch and my belly needed some love. I don't really drink alcohol all that often so the beer side of things here I cannot speak to - BUT, the BBQ Chicken farmers salad I had was awesome.    One of the reasons I liked it so much was the subtle use of grilled red onions and also the crumbled blue cheese which was pleasantly understated. (Not too strong long some blues are.)  The spinach in the salad tasted fresh and the the bits of bacon and BBQ Chicken was great. Next time I think I'd request double chicken.   The staff was very friendly and when they found out that I'm from away they welcomed me to Cleveland with a smile.   Great spot and if I drank beer I'd totally come here again - heck, I'd come here again anyhow and next time I'll come at an hour when I can enjoy a brewski.   Fun times, friendly people, nice atmosphere. Stop in!"}
{"text":"My lovely colleague and friend Cara L insisted on taking me to Great Lakes Brewing Co. for a glass of their Christmas Ale, which she described as something along the lines of \"Christmas crack.\" We took a seat at a high top in the bar area and I ordered a pint, hoping my feelings would be as enthusiastic. 'Twas indeed an addictive pint of brew. Smooth, strong and with just the right spice of the season, I liked it so much I ordered another at the next bar. And now that I'm back home, I'm hitting up Philly Tap Finder to track the sucker down.   GIVE ME ALL THE CHRISTMAS ALE!"}
{"text":"Loved the interior and outside seating in the Fall was just perfect! The beers we all got were amazing and burgers were okay. Everything else was amazing and I loved the service there, everyone was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I need to start off by saying that we frequent Red Ivy in Chicago and always drink Great Lakes beers for Browns games on Sundays. This is where I began my love for Great Lakes Brewery.   Stopping in for a quick bite to eat and a drink on the way back to Chicago from NE Ohio, we were seated on the second floor next to the bar. This place is so cozy, quaint, and homey around the holidays! I immediately felt comfortable here. I didn't know that GLBC has their own farm in the city (what!?) that they grow some of their own ingredients, raise their own cows, let the employees have \"work\" days over there to help turn over compost, harvest ingredients, etc. I think that is just awesome.   My mom and I split the spinach salad and the burger (whichever one has the BBQ on it). I wasn't thrilled with the spinach salad, but the burger was pretty tasty. I tried Padre's fish tacos and they definitely have a kick to them! Refreshing and on the lighter side...very good. I'll certainly come back for the ambiance and beer, and maybe I'll try different food items next time I'm in the area.   No matter how you look at it, I love this place. I love Christmas Ale. I love Cleveland (and I was raised in Chicago!). And I will do most anything to support CLE for the rest of my days...as long as it doesn't include supporting LeBron."}
{"text":"The beer is excellent, of course, although admittedly I tend towards more experimental brews such as can be found at other local breweries in the area (won't name names out of respect, but hence the 1 star docked). But GLBC is the ambassador of the midWest, especially CLE, in many respects, and the title is well deserved.  If you do make it down to the gastropub, don't skip out on the food. The fare and recipes are simple but never cease to delight. I highly recommend the Mac n Cheese, the poutine paprikash, and the Cubano. Their food is truly what sets them apart from other gastropubs in the area."}
{"text":"I love this brewery!  A must visit when I am in Cleveland.    Great Lakes has been brewing quality beer for some time now and is one of the largest microbreweries in the nation.  You can find a wide range of beers, from the general lighter lagers all the way through to intense big beer style ales.  The food is decent, average to above average pub-type food, but I go for the beer.    The atmosphere is also fantastic.  There are several rooms within this old building.  The first room on the ground floor has a large, beautiful wooden bar.  There is also a large gift shop next to the bar.  For a real treat, head to the basement where you will find old stone walls a another bar with some tables.  It feels like your having a beer in a German beer cellar circa 1800.    When in Cleveland, Great Lakes is a must see for any beer fan."}
{"text":"The brewery tour was great!! We had so much fun and loved all the beer samples! Highly recommend the tour, made for a great day with great beer! :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this local brewery in the heart of Ohio City off of West 25th across from the Flying Fig. I had the salmon salad, which was cooked just right for me on a better of crisp lettuce with sweet peppers. This is a casual dining place where everyone can come enjoy some local food and beers.  You have to check out the basement where you can see where they use to brew beer, but better yet, schedule a tour of the actual brewery. It is amazing!! My favorite beer is the class Great Lakes Dortmunder lager beer. This is a must stop place in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch Dec 26th 2012 on a recommendation from our son. A snow storm was expected so I had iced tea. Our waitress suggested Dortmunder for my husband which was very good. I ordered an old world burger. My husband ordered a blue cheese burger. The old world burger came on a  pretzel bun which tasted like it had just come out  of the freezer...hard as a rock. Medium well was extremely dry, over done,crumbly; for both burgers. Bar b que sauce and fries were exceptional!  Best I have had in a long time! Very inconsistent. Waitress was not attentive at all. We arrived at 11:20. were told we could wait until opening at 11:30 in the gift shop. We were then herded into the covered patio room instead of main dining area. Was very cold, Didn't remove our coats the whole time. Will; not be returning!"}
{"text":"I like Great Lakes so much that it hurts to write this review, but here goes. I ordered takeout on Saturday - a chicken pesto sandwich with a $2 upgrade to a side salad and a burger.   First, I know their take out always takes forever so this time I called really early at 12:20pm and was told 20 minutes, knowing better I showed up at 1pm. Order still was not ready and bartender had to go back twice before bringing it out at 1:10pm.   I ordered the chicken pesto with the side salad and he first part that was annoying was that my side salad was placed in the same box as the sandwich so the lettuce began welting. Not sure why they wouldn't have placed it a separate container.  Then the worst part, I'm starving so o take a bite into my sandwich and it tastes pretty good and then I see it a hair! Ugh!!!! Why???? So needless to say that went  in the trash.  Then to the burger that was to be cooked medium well, well it was medium rare. It took 50 minutes for my order they said would take 20 and then they gave me an undercooked burger.   So both meals were a complete bust and ended up in the trash. I called Great Lakes and was transferred to a manager, he offered a refund, which is appropriate, but it still doesn't fix the fact that we had to forego lunch."}
{"text":"The beer is a no brainer, they have an excellent spread of classic Cleveland bites that will leave you full and wanting more. But the service...now that's what sets this place apart from the rest! Abigail was not only an amazing server but she really took the time to make us feel welcomed. We felt as if we were in her own home, she put out the red carpet for us and we could not have felt more comfortable being here. We can't wait till we come back, we will most definitely be requesting her again, as you should as well."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this brewery during my recent trip to Cleveland.  So many of the beers sounded good - fortunately I was able to taste most of the ones I was interested in - went with the Irish ale.  Veggie burger with pepper jack cheese was pretty good - freshly made with black beans and peppers.  Fries were AWESOME - steak fries with salt, pepper,parm, and thyme.  Diverse crowd.  It was a great way to end the work day.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I'm sure the food and beer have been talked about enough in the other hundred reviews, so I'm going to touch on why Great Lakes is a five star company to me. There are tons of breweries in the US and abroad that make beer as good as GLBC. I can't think of a one of those that can match GLBC's commitment to it's community, both local and global.  - Their delivery truck and fatty wagon both run on straight vegetable oil - reclaimed and filtered from their own restaurant. - The spent grains from the brewing process feed livestock that ends up on their menu, is used in their bread, and is fed, along with other scraps, cardboard, etc., to worms in their composting operation. - As much produce as possible for the restaurant is grown in a local, urban farm (that gets the compost from the restaurant) - They have been one of the single biggest contributors to the cleanup and revitalization of the Great Lakes. They started a (now) large non-profit dedicated to this mission, and throw a huge annual festival to raise money for the Lakes - The restaurant/bar features tons of environmental LEED type upgrades, updates and so forth...too many to even list   I'm sure there are other initiatives I'm unfamiliar with or am leaving out, but as far as sustainability and environmental stewardship, few companies PERIOD, and certainly no other brewery, can really compare to GLBC. This is why they have my heart.  P.S. Did I forget to mention, \"OHIO BITCHES!!!\"?"}
{"text":"How do you not love GLBC? I would say it's the cream of the crop when it comes to Cleveland beer. It's a fun place that generally (at least at the bar) has a fun atmosphere and a knowledgeable staff.   My boyfriend and I love to come here on days we know we're in for the long haul day drinking. Starting off with a sampler from GLBC will surely set you on the right track. We enjoy tasting all the options and making the other drink the ones we don't really like. It's become a nice seasonal game and fun thing for us to do.   We also have lunch. Food has been on par. Nothing great, nothing terrible. It is, in my opinion, a step up from normal bar eats (think Paninis). I've had the pulled pork sandwich which I was not a fan of and more recently tried the pretzel and beer cheese soup. Really liked the pretzel with the mustard varieties and while I wanted to love the soup - I just didn't. It didn't do it for me.   Overall very fun places with good memories and fun crowd. I actually want to go as I'm writing this. Would highly recommend this place especially to people from out of town."}
{"text":"We did the tour and it was amazing.   Can I just leave my review at that? I mean that all that needs to be said right?   Ok, ok let me get into the details. I signed my guy and I up for the tour for a Friday evening at 8pm. The charge was 5$ a person which was totally worth it. For the 5$ each you get 4 tickets which get you 4 samples of the different beers. And by samples, I mean 7oz pours! You can mix and match your beers or keep to one, your choice. Along with the samples you get an hour history and tour of the company, the beer and the facility.  It was pretty interesting to hear about the history of the company, the restaurant, the bar, and all of the interesting things that happened behind closed doors. The facility works 24/7 so it's pretty cool to see beer being made right in front of you.   I highly recommend this to anyone that's never done the tour before or even if you have, go do it again."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland I wanted to visit the West Side Market but it was unfortuately closed (what's up with their odd hours?).  It was lunch time and my husband and I were hungry.  I wanted to try the Flying Fig but they weren't open at lunch time.  The only restaurant open on their block was the Great Lakes Brewing Co. The restaurant was packed with people sitting outside so that was a good indication that it must be good. So, we decided to give it a try.  We ended up sitting inside because it was so hot outside.  We started with Buffalo wings for appetizer. The wings were okay. For my entree I ordered one of their burgers because the menu said it was made fresh daily at the Westside Market and is made of Amish raised beef and Amish made cheese.  My burger was so delicious.  My husband ordered the Pretzel chicken and enjoyed it as well.  I'm not a beer drinker so I didn't try one of their brews but I've heard that they are great. The only negative about the restaurant was the slowness of service. There weren't many people sitting inside so service should have been fast but it wasn't.  The server was really slow in filling in our waters and getting our food to us."}
{"text":"I went here with a buddy while we were exploring Cleveland's best. I was trying to pack in as much CLE in two days as I possible could, and this brewery made the cut. Even on a Monday night, this place was busy. We were sat in the area closest to W. 25th where I think the roof opens in the summer days. The patio looks like it would be an amazing place to drink in the summer heat. The area we were in was pretty bland, but the rest of the bar, including the basement, are great places to eat.  We had a few of the beers that are only available on tap during certain seasons. My buddy had the Grand Cru Belgian Ale and I had the \"Truth, Justice, and the American Ale\", a beer with a great bite of hop. Both beers were fantastic. I would definitely get them again. We ordered the cheese/meat for an appetizer. The meats were surprisingly good, and the cheeses and breads were great as well. It could probably do for more bread, especially since the plate cost $14. Between two people, it was a good starter.   He had the fish and chips, which I'm told were delicious. It came with double fried, garlic, and cheese tatter tots. They were HUGE and phenomenal. I had the pretzel breaded chicken with smashed (not mashed) potatoes and green beans. It was nothing spectacular, but the pretzel breading on the chicken was great. It was a solid meal, and I think it was a decent price.   Altogether, I enjoyed the place and will probably go back again. The place doesn't really set itself apart much from other brewery restaurants, but it's all done well enough that it doesn't need to."}
{"text":"Stopped here during my day in Ohio City. Service was a little slow but my food was delicious. I had one of their summertime flatbreads and it was a combination that seemed odd but was so amazing. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Tonight, I tried the smoked pulled pork sandwich and it was AWESOME.  As I was walking up to the brewery, I smelled two things: hops and BBQ smoke.  I was hoping it was Great Lakes that made some authentic smoky BBQ and it turns out they do!  So I looked for smoked menu items and I ordered the Bon Mi, which has authentic smoked pulled pork.  They also make a Cubano sandwich which is also delicious with smoked meat, but it was not on the menu tonight.  The waitress was perfect and the food was delicious.  The beers were great tonight too.  We tried 8 different beers and most of them were yummy.  Tonight's favorite beer was the Blackstout, which had hints of coffee and hops.  We had to wait 45 minutes to get a table, but they'll call your cell phone.  So we went next door to Bier Markt and had some of their brews before getting our table at Great Lakes.    On the way out, I bought a nice metal bottle opener.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best brewery tours, I've ever been on.  And the food at the Brewpub was amazing"}
{"text":"Love getting the beer flight paired with the sausage sampler. For one person this gives an incredible & economical opportunity to enjoy some great drink and food. The sausages aren't your typical fare (e.g. chicken/chorizo/etc) but they're well made. The beer is top notch and the flight gives you an amazing array."}
{"text":"I think that the main focus of my review here will be on what I feel is most important - the beer!  There isn't enough I can say about the beer at Great Lakes Brewing Company.  I am quite sure that as far as quality AND selection go, GLBC has to have one of the greatest lines of beer in the country.  Now, being from Cleveland I could be biased, but I strongly believe this.  The range from Dortmunder to Burning River, Eliot Ness to (the ultimate and seasonal) Christmas Ale - Great Lakes covers all the bases.  I challenge anyone to find me another brewery with as extensive a list of quality beers as GLBC.  Though they are limited to their beer when visiting the restaurant or bar, that is all you really need.  If you are in town for a while, or just new to the area, I strongly encourage you to visit Great Lakes at some point soon.  The Christmas Ale is fantastic, as are any of the other beers on the list.  Not to mention that they have a quality menu with many of the ingredients sourced locally as much as possible.  One of my favorites."}
{"text":"I was in cleveland for a weekend course that I decided to skip half way out on for the Ohio city festival. We ended up ordering some appys and beer flights at this place. It is cute with indoor and outdoor seating. They had pretty good pretzels with cheddar soup and tater tots cajun blue cheese was the flavor. To be honest I wish the tot's had more of a blue cheese flavor. Very fun environment but nothing that was too memorable. Still, if you just want to drink beer and have a social atmosphere it is a decent place!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, excellent location, and awesome beer - TERRIBLE wait & ticket times. Our party of 3 waited 1 hour to be seated and over 1 hour to receive our food. Admittedly, contrary to popular belief- people WILL wait for great food, but sadly... the food left a lot to be desired. Our mediums burger were rare, the fries were cold, and the appetizer tasted like Skoal Straight (which I love - but it's not for everyone). Overall, the brewery has great things going for it but they simply cannot not accommodate the volume of demand. My personal experience sucked, but it may not be the case for you and your party."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times, and I've ordered the potroast, the brats+mash, and the burger: - Potroast - when they have it - is mindblasting. Melt-in-your-mouth, slow-cooked, thick, savory beef with buttery mashed potatoes and veggies. Topped with gravy: it was spot on. Not salty, not dry. Excellent. Around $13.  - Brats & mash = exactly what I hoped for: a couple of tasty brats, a dollop of tangy brown mustard, some cabbage, and a few pierogies. A hearty meal - nothing fancy - but solid. Around $11.  - Burgers: they frickin' blow. A huge letdown for a brewery. I mean, what's a brewery without the standard American staple item? The burger tasted like it came from the frozen food isle at Dave's - too salty, as if it was spiced with Season All. With generic white buns to boot. The burger was so disappointing, I can't remember what the fries tasted like (sorry).  Summary: burger was crap, but the other 2 items have been outstanding. Service is average, nothing to call home about. And, of course, the beer is delicious."}
{"text":"Great brews, don't get me wrong. Great brews.  An old schoolmate called me up randomly during work, stating that he was in Cleveland looking to buy a car..and wanted to meet up. I suggested GLB. It's a Cleveland staple, no?  We went and were seated in this random side part of GLB with a fireplace. I had never seen that side of GLB before so it was kind of nice to be seated in a cozy area.  Not being too hungry, we ordered a couple of appetizers. Having had the so-so calamari on a previous visit, I asked the waitress this time what she recommended. We got the local and fresh plate, and pub bites. I found the pub bites to be a tad too breaded...so not fun to eat. The local and fresh plate had some interesting sausages on it...but they just weren't that flavorful. The cheese selection wasn't that good either.  Don't get me wrong- the dortmunder, christmas ale, and burning river are to DIE for. But food? Meh. Not so much..."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm pregnant, so no beer for me on this trip; however, my husband and our friends are longtime fans of GLB beers, and I have tasted a few different types. I've yet to taste a brew I didn't like.  I didn't know the Great Lakes Brewing Company had a restaurant, so this was a pleasant surprise for me. After a few long hours wandering the West Side Market, it was time to sit down and eat a proper meal.   No matter where you sit - the dining room, pub or patio area, the environment is friendly, warm and comfortable. Service is speedy and polite. The menu itself is rather large and offers appetizers, soups, sandwiches, salads, etc. Our table ordered a pot pie, a bowl of the soup du jour, and a veggie pizza. Everything came out steaming hot and perfectly cooked. I enjoyed the incorporation of the brewery's beers and local ingredients. After eating, we checked out the gift shop, where I was pleased to find moderately priced items.   Overall, this is an excellent choice for a great meal and a good beer!"}
{"text":"Basically- the classic Cleveland destination. Food is decent for a brewery, however the beer is the drawing point. Obviously. Nothing quite like a chilled Dortmunder or Elliot Ness to liven the tastebuds (or even better...***CHRISTMAS ALE***) You will certainly find a new appreciation for Cleveland here."}
{"text":"We stopped by here before our drive home.  The place was busy with a few Yankee fans stopping by before the game.  BJ had a Burning River pale ale.  He really liked it.  We shared an artichoke crock.  The dip was really spicy and served with pita chips and hot pepper rings.  We really liked it.  This was a nice place to hang out, kill time, drink beer and people watch."}
{"text":"Their beer is great. The food is great. The service is great. And heck, Cleveland itself actually seems pretty great.   I loved this spot so much I went back the next day to get a growler of the Christmas Ale and ended up in the middle of a holiday celebration with samples of mulled beer and adult hot chocolate drinks!   Try the Mac and Cheese. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Loved the set up of this place.  While we didn't eat here, we explored and had drinks.  We were only in town for a few days and hoped to catch a glass of Christmas Ale.  Unfortunately, we were two days too early!  Hopefully next year!  Would have given 5 stars if the bartender in the basement didn't seem so disgusted that we asked for a Christmas Ale... the other customers picked up on it too.  Maybe she was just having a bad day, after all, it was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and she was stuck in the basement with a bunch of happy weekenders!"}
{"text":"5 for beer, 2 for food.  We came for the Christmas Ale that is well known, and it is well-deserved. It has the spices of all your favorite Christmas flavors as well as a strong flavor of honey.  It's 7.5% ABV, but you can't tell so be careful (this is a compliment). It quickly has become one of my favorite beers ever tasted and the other beers were good as well. We tried the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and it was a classic porter and smooth.   Since they are famous for their beers, I'll move onto the food.  The fish and chips we got were bad, and it hurts me to say this since the staff were very nice and our waitress was awesome.  The fish was somehow overcooked and chewy and the batter was soft and soggy and chewy as well. Very strange combination. I don't know if this means they overfried it or underfried it. The gumbo was decent and no complaints there. It had good heat for gumbo and we enjoyed it.  Since Great lakes is a brewery, we are giving it a 4/5, taking away one point for food. I would definitely come back for the bar and to visit the store to take home some beers, but I would go somewhere else for dinner first."}
{"text":"Stopped for a bit before an Indians Game.  We were outside on the patio where you can order \"baskets\" of food and drinks from the bar inside.  The beer choices are fantastic and the food was surprisingly good.  We had the pretzel bites, the house made tator tots and the sliders.  All of them were quick to come out, fresh, hot and yummy.  We also paid $1 to get a ride to and from the Indians Game on their Fatty Wagon.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot! I first have to say how nice it is to see nothing but smiling faces from all of the staff from beginning to end of our time spent here. It is refreshing to see that they seem to love their job and are well trained in their jobs.   There are so many options here, sit on the beautiful and welcoming patio, upstairs bar, downstairs bar, regular indoor tables. We opted for outdoor patio because of the gorgeous night. It is clean with the perfect ambiance. There was an Indians home game last night and it was packed, but the crowd was not obnoxious. It was fun, polite, and everyone was well behaved.   Had the Dortmunder Lager as my beer last night, the table shared pub bites, pretzels, and I personally had the Spinach and Brie pizza as my entree. Food is very good, all ingredients are from local Ohio vendors, which I appreciate. We were a group of four and all entrees were presented in a lovely manner and everyone enjoyed their food (pulled pork sandwich, steak special, another pizza). I could not finish the pizza, but packed it up in a (A+ for this!) Eco-friendly to go box!   Our waitress was amazing. Very personable, attentive, never let beers or waters go completely empty, she even had cute little hops earrings on. She was great!   This was a wonderful experience and I'm just sad I don't live in town! I'll have to talk my boyfriend in moving back to Cleveland!! :)"}
{"text":"En route to Cleveland, I was looking up places to grab a beer. Little did I know, Cleveland is the home of GLBC, it was decided 2 hours before arriving in the city that this would be one of our first stops this past Saturday.  We arrived around 2:00PM, and the place was packed - we put our name in with the hostess, and moseyed on over to the bar for some bevs while we endured our 30-45 minute wait. I had the Christmas Ale, and YUM! loved it.  We were seated well before the 30 minute mark, and ordered the Local and Fresh plate as an appetizer, as well as a beer sampler - you can try all of the beers for $16.50 which was a great value. The meat and cheese plate was good, I enjoyed it but wish there would've been one more cheese just because there was a lot more meat than cheese. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, and apologized profusely when she realized she forgot to drop the check for our entrees - we were not in a hurry, nor starving, so it was all fine by us - we did appreciate that she communicated this to us though. I had the Old World Burger with fries, and my  boyfriend had the Black & Blue Burger. The fries were like crack - I don't know what made them so good but they were ah-mazing. We spent a good chunk of our afternoon here, before heading to the Cavs game and I am so glad we did. I would certainly return next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Wait... I haven't reviewed GLBC? My only excuse is that living 2 blocks from it, I suppose I kind of take it for granted but there's really little I can add to the already spot-on raves from fellow Yelpers.   GLBC is in the top 5 of \"Where would you take someone who's new to Cleveland?\" restaurants, again specifically because I live in Ohio City. The atmosphere is great although as some have said, crowded during certain events such as the Christmas Ale release.   The food - eh, the burgers I've had there aren't OMG, but they are locally raised, sustainable blah blah as it goes these days, farm to table and all that. I mean they feed the cows the spent grain from the brewery - talk about recycling. What friends and I love to get are the pub bites - they're like chicken nuggets, only delicious little cod bites! They come with a house \"tartar sauce\" that is def homemade without pickles to muck it up. Pickles are ew. It even has a slight kick from horseradish to tingle your tastebuds and of course to leave your mouth yearning for what? Wait for it.....  A tall, cold beer.   I'm not a craft beer geek... I barely know what hops are other than a natural pain reliever. It's true, Go on, open Google in a new tab and look it up. I don't care about some scale that measures hoppiness in a beer and I kind of feel like being caught up in all that takes away from just enjoying the product. In my case I'm afraid I'm pretty unadventurous - I like the Dortmunder and Burning River Pale Ale and like many, I could bathe in Oktoberfest brew. I'm telling you... Early October, that chill in the air and you're sitting outside with some chums enjoying Oktoberfest beer while dipping their spent grain bread into some Stilton cheddar soup? Heaven, baby.   LOL, one word though... I did find out after rather swooping in on a brewery tour one night as they walked into the plant, that it is not \"free\", but ha ha, the lady just said well, nothing we can do about it now, consider it your Christmas present.   I love living in Ohio City, love walking to the market and smelling the malt and yeast coming from Great Lakes, love that they are sustainable, and love telling people about our terrific city. Now get out there and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Come for the beer rather than the food. I have been to the brewery before, but this was my first time eating here. The food is classic bar food. Nothing special but will do the trick if you need sustenance to consume those beers. The beers are great (we each did a flight with 5oz samplers) and there is just pride and excitement that comes along with visiting here if you're a beer lover.  Here is what we ordered  1. Vegetable pizza - skip this, not great 2. Pretzel with beer sauce - can't ever go wrong  3. Old World Burger - better than pizza, but overall pretty average  4. Fish and chips - average  5. Ravioli - pretty good and would recommend"}
{"text":"To be sung to the tune of O' Tannenbaum....with a fierce hangover.  O' Christmas Ale, O' Christmas Ale,  Thy alcohol so potent.  O' Christmas Ale, O' Christmas Ale,  Two pints and I'm so bloated.  Thy kegs arrive each Christmastime,  To tempt us all with D.U.I.s.  O' Christmas Ale, O' Chrismas Ale,  Thy alcohol so potent."}
{"text":"I really want to dig this place, I really do.  The beer is good, the service decent, the staff friendly, the location cool.  But it's always packed.  Always!    Granted, I've only been here 2 or 3 times but there are folks standing around when you walk in, at least if it's after 4pm (maybe lunch is the time to go).  The seats at the bar are taken.  The tables in the bar area are full.  It's no wonder everyone is standing around.  Of course, delicious beer makes me a bit more accommodating when it comes to comfort and standing around.  When the downstairs is open there are more options and more space and thus more opportunities to put your butt in a seat.  I like the vibe downstairs, too.  I can't make heads or tails of when they open it, though.  I guess business and staff on hand helps determine that.  Commodore Perry is the best brew they serve in my opinion, but give all the beers a try. They make a fine Christmas Ale too.  However, they don't come cheap.  It's not highway robbery (like their growlers - $19 for a fill-up?!?!) but it is a little steep compared to pretty much every other brewpub I've been to."}
{"text":"After visiting the famed Great Lakes Brewery I can't help but be extremely disappointed. After arriving at the brewery and thinking they had a brewery tour on the hour every hour, as their website stated, me and my boyfriend were directed to their pub to wait until their next brewery tour at 5pm, we arrived at 1pm. We were met by a unwelcoming bartender, who was not personable or friendly and the only time we saw a glimpse of a smile was when we were handed our bill. We left the pub to wander around and kill some time before the next tour at 5pm. We arrived back at the Great Lakes Brewery for the brewery tour at 4:45pm and were informed that all the spots had been filled for that tour. We explained that we had been in the area waiting since 1pm to go on the tour and were shrugged off as though it was of no concern to the staff member. He instead told us that we could wait around for 2 more hours to attend the 7pm brewery tour. Not once when we had asked two of the staff members earlier that afternoon about the tour did either of them inform us that we could or should reserve a spot ahead of time for the tour. We are especially disappointed about our experience because we are visiting from Florida and were very excited to visit this brewery as it was one of my boyfriends favorites."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company has always been on my list of breweries I wanted to visit.   The neighourbhood was dark and quiet when we arrived after our Cavaliers game but the pub was busy and hopping!  We sampled some Pub Exclusive which only available at the actual Brewery:  Red Right 88 Cleveliner Weisse Ohio City Farmhouse Rye-O-Rye Can't We Win Orange and Brown  Mash Appeal (Collaboration with Oskar Blues and Lagerheads) Beer for Beer Week 2015  Service was super friendly. I love the selection on taps which changes seasonally.  Great place for beer lovers and as a neighourhood pub to chill with your friends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a beautiful Spring afternoon sitting in the patio at Great Lakes Brewing Company while in town for business. Maybe due to slower afternoon staff, but we had to order inside and bring it out to a small patio area just for people who weren't there to eat. Not too big of a deal. Beer was good."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. The food was good, but the Italian sandwich was a lot more bread than meat. My husband had the Cubano and said it was very good and it was more of a panini. The perogies were offered an an alternative to fries and were delicious. Husband tried a couple of new beers that we can't get at home. Nice pub feel and our waitress was very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My review is specifically for Tuesday night trivia night upstairs because that's all I've attended recently.  We always have such a good time at this trivia night. The service is friendly, fast and exactly what you'd expect from this establishment. The food is good, well priced and very good portions. This week I tried the Turkey Pickle- the pickled onions and dill slices were out of the world. Not to mention the great beer and extensive drink menu.  The trivia itself is hosted by Geeks Who Drink and our Quizmaster is always fun and fair. it's a good mix of questions and everyone is really friendly. Come up and enjoy some competition and brews!  The building is set in a quaint, hip neighborhood of Cleveland on a darling little brick street. The décor is very Cleveland-y and there's a great vibe here. Fabulous outdoor seating area and lots of people watching to be done!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the elevated pub menu that utilized local ingredients. Delicious food, great beers, and a good atmosphere and location!"}
{"text":"Very cool environment, great for date night or a night out with friends. Food was average. We got the nachos and I had a salmon salad. The beer was good!"}
{"text":"Rolled in on a hot Saturday on the road in desperate need of most things.  Found all of them at GLBC. I'm no stranger to this brewery. Their Nosferatu was one of the first craft beers I ever had years ago and they've been cranking out some good shit for a long time. I had a Mole Blackout Stout and it was awesome. Since I was driving it was the only beer I had, but my buddy had several others and he enjoyed them all. That grilled cheese tho! Prosciutto, manchego, provolone and fig jam on sourdough. Probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had. I see you Cleveland, and I ain't mad at you.  Side note: Are figs a thing in Cleveland? I saw many much figs. Get at me.   I was a little leery about stopping in so soon after the Republican National Convention, thinking the city might be a mess. What I found was a shady table on their lovely patio that made it hard to believe a busy street was about 50 feet away. Our waitress was sweet as can be and helped us relax for a bit during a long day of driving. I look forward to returning on my next jaunt through Cleveland."}
{"text":"This one is homey, homie.  Got a chance to stop by Great Lakes while we were in Cleveland and I have to say the brewpub is pretty unique and quite cozy feeling. There was a bit of a wait when we visited so we decided to check out the pub downstairs and have a beer while we waited and caught part of the Ohio State vs Michigan game. Great ambiance and the space overall is great. The building seems to be carved out from either a previous home unit and we were seated upstairs with a nice view against a window once our table was ready.   For food we shared the Cleveland hero sandwich and the farm stand salad. Sandwich had Pastrami, Genoa salami, Bavarian ham, Muenster, lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, rustic Italian bread from Zoss the Swiss Baker. Sandwich was just alright, but have to say that I enjoyed the farm stand salad a bit more featuring grilled pork tenderloin from Dee Jays Meats, Ohio apples, red onion, Montforte bleu cheese, sliced almonds, & Mediterranean mixed greens from Great Lakes Growers. So many components to it, but went together so well.  Anyways, they also have pretty good beer here if you didn't know. Definitely would try a pint or two. 'Til next time, cheers!  308/365"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Great Lakes Brewery. On the one hand, it's a Cleveland landmark and I do love their brews. On the other hand, I think their food needs an upgrade for being such a go-to spot. If you're down with bar food, great, but I've ordered their specials before and felt there was much to be desired. But their beer though...and they are sustainable! I will move this from a 3 to 4 just for what they do for the community and the environment."}
{"text":"great beer horrible service! The Cheddar Stilton soup was good but had some kick to it. The entire experience was marred by the fact that our server was SLOW! It took her over 40 mins to bring our check amd that was after we spoke to the manager. We will buy the beer and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"This breaks my heart to write. They once had a menus that matched the amazing beer. Beer still amazing. The staple of the Cleveland community. Food, not so much. Pretzel chicken, was once legendary in the Early 90's. Huge helping, like two huge breasts. Moist, rich, amazing. Now just a dried us mess wanting to be more. Burgers ordered medium rare, just came out raw and mushy.  The fries remind me of Burger King fries. The didn't seem real. Definitely out of a frozen box and highly processed. The 4 sausage sampler was 4 small pieces. Over cooked and dry. It looked liked it sat under a heat lamp for a day. Even the mustards were dried out and had skin. It was bad. Beer, awesome, drink there eat somewhere else. Cool atmosphere. There's a \"real\" Bullet hole behind the bar."}
{"text":"Had dinner here outside, food was good quality, lots of beers, I tried the flights 15 beers.  Try the porter on nitro- the best.  Platter of meats was good and paired up with a salad and or veggie dish works great."}
{"text":"I know this is a big brewery, and when I was in town from Chicago, I def made a point to stop here, unfortunately since it was a Saturday it was packed and we werent able to sit and order food, rather we were only able to get drinks down in the basement, which was not bad by any means, the decor down there is cool, I tried 2 new beers, and got one of the coffee cocktails which was good, it's located in a cool area near some other breweries and the big city market, plus everyone I know always recommends it. If I am ever back I will try and make a point to sit down and order some food since it looks good"}
{"text":"Ate here last night after a day at the Rock & Roll museum. Being a beer lover and having tried the Perry porter in bottle I wanted to try  more beers. It was busy yet I was seated very quickly. My server, Linda was very nice, prompt and attentive. Instead of doing flights they offer 5oz glasses for $2 each. That was the perfect amount to try a few beers. I loved their regular Pale Ale. I had the blue burger and added bacon. It was done to a true medium perfection as Linda said it would. Not the CA medium which is now raw in the center. I changed up to the special  southwest Monterey/Cheddar  tater tots, which were to die for. They were quite large and I found it difficult to eat my last one although I really wanted to.  The building is beautiful and just about across the St from the West Side Mkt. Many of their ingredients comes from the Mkt. If ever in CLE again I would come by and try more beers and grab a pub nosh."}
{"text":"great customer service, good food/beer/cocktails... will be coming back!"}
{"text":"fun , busy place near the Market. Went there for lunch on Sat. very busy but we were seated fast in the upstairs area.  Good beers and the pub food is better than average.  it is quite loud.  i would return."}
{"text":"I've been putting off a trip to Great Lakes for awhile because I panic at the thought of the Ohio City crowds on a weekend. My SO and I went at about 4 on a Saturday, and the wait was surprisingly short. Every Clevelander knows Great Lakes and has tried at least the Christmas Ale and a few other brews. What's nice about actually visiting the brewery is that they have exclusive beers you can only get there. I had a \"cellar dweller\" brew and it is now one of my favorite Great Lakes selections.  I never thought I'd utter the words, \"like my grandma used to make\" at a brewery. Then I bit into their pierogies and was proven wrong. I came for the beer and burgers, but I left being unable to shut up about their doughy pillows of bliss. Everything I tasted was delicious, and the service was pretty prompt considering it was a packed house. It seems that the majority of the food is local, and it also seems like they are utilizing their prime location next to the market by incorporating Ohio City favorites. It's too bad I'm a one-and-done kind of girl on alcohol because there were so many beer flavors I wanted to try. I'm already dying to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is great! The pub in the basement has great service. I am not a fan of beer, but my boyfriend enjoyed their blackout stout that they had on draft last night. The environment is casual."}
{"text":"So cool! I came here with a group of work friends, and we had a great time. They have a very interesting menu and great happy hour specials. We started off with the pretzel bites, which were really good. I then ordered the Cobb salad, which was pretty different, but it was still good. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First of all - some of the best beer ever, in the bottle or on draft, and it only gets better when at the source.  The pub downstairs is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.  The restaurant itself has some really great food - and recommendations for what beer to pair with it.  Doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"We came here for a drink before the Indians home opener and it was packed with fans.  We were able to find a spot by the downstairs bar and thoroughly enjoyed the vibe and the beer!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out for food on a recent trip to Cleveland because like all other natives I love their beer! We checked in via the Yelp app which was super simple and told the host stand who we were when we arrived.  I love being able to do that and it texts me when my table was ready! It was about the same wait as I was quoted and we were at our table. We went on a Saturday so the place was super busy but it didn't seem to effect service. Both me and my date had burgers and of course I had a need (Burning river ale) and everything was delicious!! I loved that the meat was locally sourced and the beer was made on site! Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back. My only complaint is there was really no where to go while waiting on my table so I always felt like I was standing in someone's way."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing has great beer! You can stop in and eat or you can pick up a case of their awesome beer! The Christmas Ale is especially good!"}
{"text":"Food may have been great! I will never know.  I called at 3pm to order a Togo late lunch, and after an automated shuffle where I listened to a self promoting commercial for the restaurant I was already going to eat at, then pressed \"3 to get to the dining room\", and then pressed, \"0 for all other calls\" the phone rang for, no kidding, 10 minutes.  Seriously. Go sit by a clock and watch it for ten full minutes, now add an annoying ring in your ear every second or so... That's how long I waited before giving up what was a supposed to be a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and liked it, but this trip was just for drinks and a brewery tour. The upstairs bar was standing room only on Thursday night around 1930 - we headed downstairs and found a full dining room, but 4 empty bar stools. Service to get our drinks was fast. As we were finishing our drinks we weren't asked if we wanted more, we were given our bill. This was fine as we had to go anyways to meet our tour, but the bartender didn't know that... We put our credit card down on the bill and then waited while the bartender fumbled with two remotes trying to change the TV channels.   Finally paid, we headed upstairs to the gift shop (far left of restaurant - in main door to left or enter via the gift shop door) where we met our tour of 6 others. Christine was our tour guide. She was very energetic, personable, funny - a great tour guide. She really knew her stuff and was good at answering questions. The brewery was in operation so in some locations she had to shout and it was kind of hard to hear her - also we couldn't get too close to the bottling room because it was being operated at the time. You can't take drinks over into the brewery with you because you must go outside and cross a public road to get there (open container law). You can get 2 samples on the tour - you have to pay something (Ohio law again) so at least BRING TWO QUARTERS. Before giving out the samples, which occurs mid-tour, I did like that Christine went through each of the current bottled beers explaining their taste and notes; it's interesting and helps you know what you might want to sample if you have not had a certain type of beer before (e.g., port - Edmund Fitzgerald). Narrow stair cases are included in tour. Note that the gift shop closes at 9p (was closed by the time we returned from our tour) so if you are on a later tour buy anything you want first - prices were pretty reasonable and a lot was on sale.   Listed on their website under Pub Events you can register and see spots available for the tours online. Tours and other events, especially weekend tours, seem to book up fast and sell out. Tours are free and run on the hour on Thursdays from 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM, Fridays from 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM and Saturdays from 1:00 PM - 8:00 PM. I went on the Thursday 8-9 tour."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic beer at the bar and meal in the beer garden yesterday.  It was an all-around great experience...extremely enthusiastic service, warm and light atmosphere, great food, and - of course - excellent beer.   We started with stilton cheddar cheese soup and the sausage sampler - both quite pleasing. The sausage was fresh from the West Side Market (across the street). My sandwich (pulled BBQ pork topped with onion straws) tasted amazing. I'm guessing the spicy BBQ sauce was a house recipe because I've never tasted anything quite like it. He liked his burger. As for beer, I usually enjoy either a Belgian or hefeweizen. The Holy Moses was right on. My other half - always fond of a nice porter - enjoyed the Edmund Fitzgerald.   The beer garden was warmed by a real fire and pleasantly full with families and couples dining, yet it never got too loud.   Great Lakes makes our visits to my family in Ohio bearable, so it was great to get the opportunity to visit in person."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. My husband is a beer-drinker while I am not, but we both really enjoy coming here. The beers are top-notch and the food is equally as good. Yes, the restaurant is always crowded and loud, but the ambiance is great. Make a reservation or you will probably have to wait for an hour in the crowded pub downstairs. You MUST give the pretzel chicken a try and finish it up with their bread pudding (worlds better than any I've ever had). I also have to give them credit for how much they work to use as many local ingredients and be as \"green\" as possible."}
{"text":"Meh, I don't know.  A typical beer and grub spot with decent beer but I had to sneak sips from my husband because the waitress went all id-gestapo on me.  This is silly considering that I'm nearly 40 and she didn't id my 17-year-old exchange student before offering her a drink.  K was driving.  It was daytime.  I didn't feel like carrying stuff.  I appreciate the whole, \"just doing her job\" thing except, again, she didn't id the teenager with me (who responsibly ordered pineapple juice).  The beer is good although my husband who was actually drinking thought he tasted a little hint of \"the lines need to be cleaned\" and I agreed.  I'm hyper-sensitive to that.  Service was slow and they messed up a simple substitution but with the crowd we didn't want to be a pain in the butt so we didn't say anything.  The food was okay, and the space is great.  I probably have some sour grapes over the id thing so I'm  bumping what I was tempted to leave at three stars to four because I get that I can hold a grudge sometimes.  If you're a beer person or out with someone who is, this is definitely a spot to hit.  There is another brew pub (Nano brewery?) nearby, too."}
{"text":"Flight of beer was amazing.   Location was amazing.   Vibe was amazing.   Prices ok.    Where they get huge dings comes down to the bartender. Daytime bartender (now we know why) last Friday with an Irish accent.  ZERO personality. When we asked if they brewed beer on site he replied, \"Yea\" and walked away. No HISTORICAL CONTEXT no tips on tours, interesting stories, nothing. No selling.  We must have woken him from his nap.  Behind us there was a scavenger hunt team and they needed to find items for their hunt. They were supposed to get context on that bullet in the wall with the flag behind the bar. When they asked the grumpy Irishman about the bullet he said, \"I know nothing of it ask the hostess.\" YIKES.    Fast forward to the Chocolate Bar across town at the arcade in downtown Cleveland, we were speaking to the bartender about his one describing how SHOCKED we were at his lack of engagement.  Our CB bartender described this guy to a tee.  His branding is loud and clear when bartenders across town know who you're describing and it's not a good thing....  Christmas Ale is out....something to be said for Great Lakes...."}
{"text":"After appointment downtown, my wife said let's do lunch. Since the \"work\" day for me was already shot, why not. And since I've drank GLBC beers for years, but never stopped in to eat, why not and we did.  Afternoon on the patio outside was perfect as was the Elliot Ness draft! There are many award winners at GLBC, but EN is my favorite. A refreshing ale that really hit the spot for lunch. Linda had a \"Mule\" and was very pleased. Now the food.  I had the Lunch special, a Buffalo Chicken wrap that was one of the best, since it was also grilled!  The grilling of the wrap was just the right touch for the chicken and tangy Buffalo Sauce. Had as the side the house fries which were perfect and next time may just be a meal themselves!  Linda had a burger and the \"tator-tots\" as the side. Burger was perfect to her liking, medium rare and juicy. The tator-tots were not your ordinary tator-tots. These were 4 large tots filled with cheese and spices that also could be a meal on its own.  Both sandwiches were large enough to take half home (AND for me taking a half home, tells you something about the size!).  All in all, a great afternoon to dine outside at one of Cleveland's landmarks, Great Lakes Brewery!"}
{"text":"While visiting cleveland for a Tigers / Indians game, I stopped here for Pizza and beer. Beer was good, Pizza  was great, no complaints"}
{"text":"GLBC is truly one of the best breweries out there. In my book, they make the best beer in the USA. The atmosphere in the restaurant is great. Yes, it often is busy, given how popular the place is, but you really have to just embrace the experience. There is a nice bar in the basement you can hang out at while you wait, or walk down West 25th and explore the lovely Ohio City neighborhood for a bit until they call you. I bring all of my friends from out of town to Great Lakes, and none of them have ever been disappointed! The gift shop is really cool too!"}
{"text":"Belgian Quad is dark and sweet with fruity overtones. And it's something I can sit and sip for hours at the bar of Great Lakes Brewing Company. Just one beer can last a long time because the flavor is that good. Also since this is a tourist stop it's a fun place to people watch. The outdoor patio is spacious and I love the inside of the bar. The old wood, the styling of the architecture all of it combined makes for a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Great drink and food! there are multiple seating and drinking areas. It's a Cleveland classic!"}
{"text":"I stopped for a beer with some coworkers while in town on business. The atmosphere was great and the crowd was lively. We sat downstairs and enjoyed a couple. I had the smoked maple porter and thier standard porter. Both were very good. And I love the authentic beer cellar feel. Great place!"}
{"text":"Had the beer sampler and an appetizer sampler. Everything was very good. Highly recommend. Head to the black pig for dinner."}
{"text":"The brewery tour was amazing. Sarah was great and really knew her stuff! Plus, the beers are delicious. I recommend it for something to do in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"GLBC, you make Cleveland rock!  Man these guys make great firkin' beer! I mean, holy cow! On a visit to Cleveland, given that it's Ohio and the area is steeped in brewing lore, GLBC was on the top of my list of must-see destinations. They did not disappoint, at all. I came in expecting to find well-crafted beer, but I did not expect to leave singing their praises to every ear, deaf or not, all the way back to California. After my visit I left with one thought, this is easily one of the top three breweries I have ever been to!  Firestone Walker makes great beer that rarely leaves San Luis Obispo, the Bruery makes great beer that has only begun to emerge from Orange, and GLBC makes great beer that needs to be nationally distributed. Not only that, their facility was gorgeous!  After two tasting flights to safari their full offerings, the gal informed us that it was Thursday, which meant Firkin' Thursday! A weekly event offering one of their selections on firkin down in the cellar of the tap house. Lucky us, the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter was that week's firkin' beauty! We went bowling and hung locally specifically to return for it and I'm glad we did, because a) the cellar is inherently hipster in a way California only tries to recreate, and b) the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is at the top of my favorite porters list! The Fitz and the Dortmunder Gold = iconic brewing execution.  If I lived in Cleveland I would be a large man, because I would literally spend my life at GLBC. Cleveland, you have a great firkin' representation in your city through this brewery and I hope to find me some Fitz and Dortmunder on our local shelves soon!"}
{"text":"They sat us upstairs first, but we didn't like the atmosphere and rickety table so we moved back down to the bar. Great food and we enjoyed the beer samples!"}
{"text":"We stopped here because I love the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and we're fans of their brews in general. All-in-all, it was a good visit, aside from the awkward hostess in the beginning, although she did seat us in the best spot outside, between the indoor/outdoor part of the restaurant and the sidewalk, just in front of this beautiful old and original brick wall and underneath a canopy of trees.   We ordered a couple of things from the menu, but all I can remember is the buffalo chicken pizza because it was so good. We both had a Commodore Perry IPA because it was National IPA Day and they were only $4.   Special Note: Check out the patio seating and def. go to the bathroom, where you'll see the tasting room and other fun stuff (not the toilet)."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food and friendly people.  Dicey neighborhood at night, but then again that may be all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love a good craft beer and Great Lakes is one of my favorites, although I have never eaten at the brewpub. All the beers were excellent as expected.  The Rye of the Tiger Rye IPA is excellent as is the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter.  Dinner was very good. I had the pulled pork with a side of sauteed kale. The pork was tender and the BBQ sauce added to the flavor but did not overwhelm. The kale was perfectly cooked with bacon and onions. I was there with a friend and the service had great timing, knowing when we needed a beer and when to let us carry on our conversation. I would absolutely go here again."}
{"text":"Two experiences here, both in search of what was supposed to be among the best fish and chips in Cleveland.  I should preface this by saying that three in our party of five don't drink.  1.  Crowded weekday evening.  90-120 minute wait!  They took our cell number, encouraged us to go for a walk around the neighborhood.  They never called.  After 90 minutes we went elsewhere and had a great dinner.  2.  Fairly quiet weekday evening.  Seated right away, but the waiter started off by warning us that the service would be subpar because he was covering tables in four different parts of the restaurant.  Ok, no rush, no problem.   Two in our party ordered the fish and chips, and described it as flavorless and oily.  I ordered the summer squash ravioli and found it to be so bitter and desiccating as to be inedible.  The menu described it as having swiss chard and walnuts, but the only other flavor was a puddle of bitter green olive oil.  The squash was lost and the pasta was doughy.  When one in our party said the fish was bland, and I declined a box for my barely touched dinner, it took forever to get the check and get out of there.  Bottom line: if you're not going for the beer, this is probably not your best bet in Ohio City for dinner."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food, but the beer is awesome and the atmosphere is fun! I highly enjoyed sitting out on the patio. Great Lakes has great beer and great services. All in all, a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Blackout Stout. 9% APV.  I know it's named after the blackout a few years back, but two of those and it brought on a brand new meaning.  Whoa!"}
{"text":"Is it possible that I can have the sampler containing 11 beers and they all suck? Yes, yes it is possible. Food was ok.  overall, don't bother."}
{"text":"Best beer in Cleveland! I've liked almost every beer I've tried here. Tastings are reasonably priced and the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing Company is a must see in Cleveland! I've been drinking their beer for years, particularly their seasonal Christmas Ale. On this trip, I took a tour of the brewery, and now I'm a bigger fan.  The tour included the opportunity to taste 4 of their 5 original beers they offer. All were delicious, and I can see how I would choose one over another based on my mood.  1. Dortmunder Gold - GLBC's first beer and award-winning lager. It would be refreshing but flavorful in the summer.  2. Eliot Ness - Named after a local celebrity who took down Al Capone. I thought this amber lager was pretty average. Not bad, but not memorable either. 3. Commodore Perry - GLBC's original IPA. It was good and balanced. Not overwhelmingly hoppy. (I preferred the Steady Rollin' Session IPA or even Lake Erie Monster Imperial IPA.) 4. Edmund Fitzgerald - MY FAVE. Absolutely delicious porter that uses coffee and chocolate malts. As it gets warmer, the flavor tastes more like chocolate. It was very smooth.  Something I learned on the tour was their commitment to \"Zero Waste\" goal. With each beer's byproduct, GLBC also makes mustard, BBQ sauce, and even donates to the local ice creamery to experiment with new flavors.   With their dedication to help their neighbors, employees, community economy and environment, I have no problem supporting the Great Lakes Brewing Company.  I did want to give a big shout out to Patrick. Thank you for an entertaining and informative tour.  NOTE: We did visit the Great Lakes Brewing Company pub and restaurant, which was packed for the holidays (and Ohio State game). It is a small venue but popular destination, so expect crowds. The service was excellent and timely, so I didn't mind the packed house."}
{"text":"Stopped in during an Ohio visit, and was not disappointed. We went for the beer, mainly the Edmund Fitzgerald (drool), and were pleasantly surprised with the food. While not a 5-star culinary experience, my compliments to the chef. We tried the Black and Bleu burger, which was definitely solid (accompanied with shoestring fries), and some pizza later on.... about five beers later on.... Anyways, the food was really well done, the beer is obviously exemplary, the wait staff was attentive, and we got to watch Sunny!!!! Check out the basement pub, pretty cool. We will definitely be back to the Great Lakes Brew Pub! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Since introduced to Great Lakes a few years ago, I have realized how beautiful these craft beers truly are! The brewpub itself is so much fun to dine in or sit down and enjoy a glass. The dining area and cellar are very rustic and sets the mood. This brewpub is great for a date or for a big group of friends!  I've had numerous beers from tap and from a bottle, but there is nothing like a fresh Christmas Ale from tap and straight from the brewery. But the menu, and the pairings that go with - such a treat! The pretzel is a huge favorite and the beet salad is very tasty! Sometimes it just gets so busy, that we pass on the food just to enjoy a beer(s). I will have to try other things next time I am in town for sure. But really, you gotta go here at least once. LOCAL beer is the best beer."}
{"text":"GLBC is always a great place to visit for good brew on tap and lunch or dinner with friends or family.    Among my favorite beers are the Oatmeal Stout and seasonal Christmas Ale.  The grilled fish of the day (seasonal, fresh, and local)  and pretzel chicken are good bets.   Bread pudding in rich rum sauce is one of the best I've had.   Great service always.  The ambience is really cool with old wooden plank flooring, and lots of pictures & ads of old brewing companies from Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for beer only. The place is always hopping and it's always great to get some brews at the heart of the company who makes them. The atmosphere is welcoming, the people great, and brews top notch."}
{"text":"Came here back in 2013 while a road trip with 2 friends. It was so good, we came back on the way home! Let's start with the beer. I'm not a big drinker but the beer here was the best I ever had! It really made me wish, at the time, we had Great Lakes at home. Surprise surprise, it started to show up in the stores and at restaurants on tap a few months later. My favorite has to be the Edmund Fitzgerland! If you can get a sampler to try out, please do so and try them all. You won't regret it!  The bar itself was small but exactly what we were looking for. Did I mention that some nights, they have live entertainment down there as well? We felt right at home. The bartender we dealt with was extremely professional and just overall a good person, making suggestions for us to try things and where to go since we were not from the area.  If I ever go back to Cleveland, this will be my first stop. Be warned though, parking situation is a little tough but this have nothing to do with the restaurant. I suggest, if you want to get a table or sit at the bar in peace, to come before the 5pm dinner crowd!"}
{"text":"Go on the tour! They have a nice gift shop which makes me feel like a tourist in my own city (in a good way). The free tour was a nice half-hour going through their factory -- you'd think you were transported in time 50 years until you get to the shinier big metal vats at the end. It's very ghostlike and it reminds me of haunted houses and abandoned buildings whenever I think about it (the factory).  I went to the restaurant/bar side of things and it was packed and bustling and everybody was having a good time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for live music on weekends, and their food selection is great. The in house brew options are also wonderful. Railway Razz is the beer of choice. This place also appeals to all ages, as the live music is anywhere from top 40 current hits, to 70s and 80s cover bands. The only slight negative I can even think of, is on weekends, the second outermost bar is crowded and rowdy. But as long as you spend most of the time in the main bar area, you will assure yourself a night of great music, great beer, and great food."}
{"text":"We came here to have a flight of beers before heading to Tremont for lunch. I've been buying bottled GLBC beers for years, but sometimes it's nice to sample a fresh pint on site. The place was packed in the early afternoon on Good Friday, but it would have only taken 10-15 minutes to secure a table. Instead, we swooped in on two seats at the bar downstairs and chose to try all 11 beers that they had on draught.  The bartenders downstairs were excellent and provided wonderful service to the packed bar area. Watching them pour flights was kind of mesmerizing and I wish I could have captured it on video! I tend to like my beers on one of either end of the spectrum: light, spicy, and fruity or dark, rich, and slightly bitter. It should come as no surprise then that my favorite draughts of the day were the Grand Cru (Belgian ale with coriander and citrus), the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter (chocolate-coffee notes), the Woodtooth Porter, and the Wolfhound Stout. I think the Wolfhound Stout was my overall favorite of the day, but we compromised and took home a growler of the Woodtooth Porter. The flight was $16.50 and well worth it, though you can sample individual beers for $1.50 a pour.  We didn't have anything to eat here, but let me tell you something...the gentleman next to me ordered the Po Man and it took some serious self-control to not straight up steal it off of his plate. The sandwich has Czuchraj smoked kielbasa, pierogies, beer mustard, and sauerkrauit (all local), and it smelled like a little slice of Cleveland heaven. If we hadn't had plans to have lunch elsewhere, that's exactly what I would have ordered. We honestly thought about staying for lunch but ended up leaving. I will be back and the Po Man will be mine!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the Great Lakes Brewery for lunch after we visited the Westside Market. It was a perfect sunny day so we sat outside on the patio. The patio is shady with lots of trees covering it so it stayed cool.  We had 5 at our table and we all shared two appetizers: the sausage sampler and the local & fresh plate. Both were delish and had the yummy meats from the Westside market. I wish we had eaten here first so that I could have run right over to the market to buy everything that we ate!  Service was perfect- our server was friendly and fun. We were here on a Saturday in June and there were street performers walking right by our table. The Guitar Hero guy stopped and even sang a song to my 6 year old nephew...So fun!  Been here twice and will always make a stop here when we visit Cleveland and the Westside Market."}
{"text":"I always love the ambience here. It is in a great location too. The building itself has so much history and it is a perfect lunch spot if shopping at the West Side Market or browsing in this fun, hip area of Cleveland.   The food is always good, but not very memorable. Beer is always great. They definitely have that down. I come back for the beer, location and friendliness of staff."}
{"text":"The brewery tour is $5. Their website recommends you purchase tickets in advance, in case they sell out for the time slot you want. But we were able to purchase tickets an hour before the tour started, for a Friday night. Tours last about an hour. They give you four tickets, and each is good for a sample of beer of your choice at the brewery. The tour itself was okay. The brewery is really noisy, so I couldn't really hear most of it. I did learn that Eliot Ness was a frequent visitor of the tavern. Another interesting thing? You can book a room in the brewery for weddings and other events.  I deffo recommend trying out their restaurant after the tour. Prices are good and portions are huge. They have different drafts on top that aren't available on the tour. They also have recommendations on the menu for what dish to pair what beer with. To start, we had the local & fresh plate. This had an assortment meats and cheeses. My favorite was the bacon, which was a little sweet, paired with the Montforte blue cheese. The sweetness and saltiness paired really well together.  For my entree, I ordered the pretzel chicken, which were chicken breasts with a pretzel coating, with a side of mashed potatoes and carrots. The chicken was perfectly cooked. Not only did it taste good but it looked so good that the next table over saw it and ordered it for themselves!  My boyfriend had the Stilton cheddar ale soup and the bratwurst & pierogi (Dortmund Gold bratwurst, potato & cheese pierogi, braised cabbage). I wasn't too keen on the pierogis because I think it was filled with goat cheese, which I'm not a fan of. The bratwurst was good, but nothing amazing. But the cheddar ale soup that the waiter recommended he pair the entree with tasted like liquid crack. It was cheddary, smooth, creamy but not nauseatingly creamy. It also went well with my pretzel chicken. Or maybe I'm just biased because it was just so good - I would probably say that it goes well with anything.  There's a gift shop in between the brewery and the restaurants. You can pick up souvenirs and more importantly, six packs to bring home!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food!! You must come here!! We love coming here before a Cavs or Indians game."}
{"text":"Dortmunder. Elliot Ness. Burning River. Commodore Perry. Edmund Fitzgerald.  ...and the greatest of them all, Christmas Ale.  The beer here is AMAZING, and enough reason to move back to Cleveland ASAP."}
{"text":"LOVE me some Christmas Ale! It is ALWAYS so crowded in Great Lakes! But, somehow we always wait and think it's worth it... probably because it truly is! Most recently, I went last night and the wait was actually pretty ridiculous. We were told it would be an hour wait, so we hung out by the bar and had a few drinks. An hour passed and we asked the status and they said soon. Then 20 minutes later, they didn't know... and 20 minutes after that, they didn't know some more... But, we had committed so much time, we def couldn't leave at that point. We were finally seated 2 hours after we arrived, but the good thing was everyone was so apologetic about us having to wait so long. They comped us with a free app - tell my why getting comped makes everything a little better. And the service once we sat (and at the bar while we waited) was exceptional. The beer was of course amazing and I had a few vodka waters, which were clearly made with decent vodka and were strong and delicious   The food was great. I've had the pretzels a few times and they're always fresh, hot and yummy! I've had the black bean burger before which was delish and the margarita pizza which I LOVED and really wanted this time. But, it was off the menu due to the season (no tomatoes). Our free appetizer was the artichoke crock and i LOVED it. There was some sort of spiciness to it which totally added to the flavor. And the pita chips were awesome. I got the mac and cheese which was delicious - a little too creamy for my liking, but still good  Wish they took reservations, don't know if I would wait 2 hours again for a table, but it's definitely great food and drinks. I heard they have a brewery tour that you can sign up for and I def want to do that at some point!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was not impressed with the Great Lakes Brewing Company, but at the same time, I'm not a knowledgeable beer drinker so bear with me. I visited with a group of friends and we had to wait about an hour and a half for a table at 3 PM on a Saturday. They don't take reservations, so we expected a short wait and happily visited Cleveland's West Side Market, which is only a short walk away. The service at the restaurant was good, and our waiter was polite and seemed to have a strong knowledge of the seasonal beers, but the food proved to be disappointing. We started off our meal with some beer and shared the Local and Fresh Plate, which was actually really tasty and contained different types of cured meats (my favorite) and cheeses. For my main course, I ordered the Pulled Pork Bahn Mi Sandwich and it was pretty unsatisfying. The sandwich was bland except for the overwhelming taste of creme fraiche with dill. Honestly, the sandwich reminded me of something I could get at my college dining hall. If I were to go again, I would order a heartier meal because it seems like they do pierogis and sausages right, but I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Great Lakes brewery is a great asset here in Cleveland. Great beer, food and service is always welcome here. One of the places I recommend to my out of town friends to check out.  We sat outside in a great atmosphere of the city. I had the high striker draft. A lighter beer with some summer hints to it. I ordered the pork tacos. The pork belly, smoked pulled pork and chicharones is the perfect combo of texture and flavor. The old world burger was also good with local beef and other ingredients. I don't give 5 stars very often, so I'm putting my rep on the line for this place."}
{"text":"I heart Great Lakes beers.  I lived in Michigan for nine years, and during that time, I was spoiled by ready access to Great Lakes brews on draft and in the bottle. While all of their beers are excellent, their Edmund Fitzgerald porter is out of this world. It ruined, absolutely ruined, Guinness for me. When I moved to MA and discovered I could no longer obtain Great Lakes without boarding a plane, I was bereft.  So of course on a trip to Cleveland I had to make the pilgrimage to the mothership. I came here for lunch and was thrilled to discover the beers weren't only amazing in my memory, but also in my mouth. The Christmas Ale was new to me but quickly became beloved, and of course I enjoyed my favorite Edmund Fitzgerald.  The food was only ok. I ordered a pork bahn mi, and it was the least Asian bahn mi I've ever seen. I don't really care if food is \"authentic\" as long as it's tasty, but the bahn mi title was actually misleading here. The sandwich was smoky barbecued pork on a soft bun with some pickled veggies, and much closer to a southern-style sandwich than a Vietnamese one. It was ok, but not what I expected based on the name and would have been improved by more sauce. A side of Brussel sprouts allowed me to pretend I was being healthy as I sipped my beer.  If I were rating only the beer, I'd award Great Lakes five stars while petitioning Yelp to let me add a sixth. Since this review is really for the location and all it includes, I've got to be honest and say it was only a four star experience. The food here doesn't seem to merit a trip, but the beer is so worthwhile that I for one would dine on Denny's while drinking it."}
{"text":"GLBC is on my list of must visit places whenever we are home for the holidays.  First of all, there is their famous Christmas Ale which needs no further comment.  This year we also discovered their Browns Ale which was also delish.  I have eaten here a handful of times and found the food to be good, although no particular dish is standing out to me.  But they have good food if you are looking for a bite to eat to go with your beer."}
{"text":"11 5 ounce flights of beer for $16.50 including tax. You cannot beat that. Come here for good beer and a good time. The Sour Porter breweries with blueberries is delicious."}
{"text":"Great Lakes Brewing is always a destination of mine when visiting Cleveland. I have been enamored with their beer since I first started drinking craft beer years ago. I have always felt fortunate to have such a high quality brewery close to home.  This brewery does a lot of things right. I have been here several times and the food is always very good. Especially enjoyable are the bratwurst and perogies. If the only perogies you have had are supermarket Mrs. T's, you are in for quite the surprise. Last time I had their daily special which was a chorizo sandwich. Yum.  The beer is, of course, great. They serve a few pub exclusives and I always like trying the stuff you can't get in bottles. Their tripel and the Stein Bock both come to mind as being excellent. If you do opt for one of their classics, it is guaranteed to be fresh. Check out the gift shop too. They have extremely fresh beer for sale to go, and occasionally a brewery exclusive such as barrel aged blackout stout.  I love the brewery's commitment to sustainability, including their use of reclaimed oil, spent grains, etc. Take the brewery tour if you are interested in hearing more about that. Heck, just take the tour anyway. It is a great experience to see a production brewery in action. Bring some change for beer samples, since they are not allowed to give them out for free.  The only thing I don't understand about GLBC is the basement area. It is dark and kind of creepy and the service was bad for us. My wife and I seriously sat for 10-15 minutes trying to make eye contact with the bartenders so they would serve us; all they while they were serving other people who came in after. I really don't get what was going on down there but it seemed odd and off-putting."}
{"text":"Get the tater tots!!!!!!!!! House made and yummy deliciousness! We ordered a Margherita,  but they didn't have all the ingredients for a traditional one, the waiters expressed this to us. She offered to make us one and it was gross but hey she tried so I can't complain.  Good food and service a rare jewel these days"}
{"text":"Having visited Cleveland for a couple days, my friend from Akron kept insisting that Ohio has microbrews on the same level of those in the Denver area.  I was quite skeptical of this, so she brought me to Great Lakes Brewing Company.  I must say, the beer is quite good.  I had the Pilsner and the Irish Stout, and both were  of high quality.  The place was quite crowded, which is a good sign.  I was looking forward to trying the belgian wheat, but unfortunately it was not available.  I'd say this place would fit in quite nicely in Denver, and if I end up in Cleveland for school I can certainly see this being a regular drinking spot.  I didn't try any of the food, but I imagine it to be pretty typical pub food... not great, but satisfying.  It's hard to say without trying a few more, but I don't think GLBC is up to the standards of the very best front range breweries, but would certainly fit somewhere in the upper half.  Drink up!"}
{"text":"It was ok the steak was good soup was gross would not recommend the cheddar soup"}
