{"text":"Can I just say that I woke up at 130 in the morning thinking about their lechon Kawali?   Vegas, you have it good with this Filipino gem. The place is very clean, lit and welcoming. It's a Filipino restaurant you wouldn't mind to eat in.   I had the bansilog, my husband got the pork bbq combo and my mom got the lechon kawali. We all had a little bit of everything from each other's plate and let me say this--- everything was delicious and the portions were very generous. You don't get this in Chicago.   Lastly, before you even order, everyone who works there already makes you feel like family.   Give this a visit and you won't regret it. You will be well fed and feel loved in no time."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Without a doubt the best Filipino food in Henderson.  We will definitely be going back on Saturday to try the Kare Kare."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Pancit was tasty. Pork BBQ/garlic rice was delicious as well. Big portions for a great price. Everyone is very friendly which is a major plus+++. Ill be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Flavorful and home made. From the moment you enter the greetings that come your way are lively, authentic and genuine.  You order your food first then sit down, much like how the process is when you eat at a fast-food joint but this place is far from being a fast-food joint. Their food selections are a variety of Filipino breakfast to Filipino comfort food, depending on how your mood is. The place is clean, well maintained and has a lot of natural light coming in. It gets your mood on a high level of happy.  I am very glad that they have opened this place that's close to my home. It's right next to the Galaxy Luxury Theatre, so for any of you who leave the theater hungry, a few steps away from you is Manila BBQ. You don't have to go far, it's just there.  What's more pleasant about this visit is I got to meet, in person, one of my Yelp friends, Momo B. and You-go. It was such a treat, indeed to be able to enjoy good food and meet new friends. Amazing! Two thumbs up to Manila BBQ and everyone come!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the hospitality from the moment you step foot in the family-owned restaurant, everyone welcomes you with positive vibes and smiley faces.  Most importantly, the service was fast and the food was fresh! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had some really great food here. The pork barbecue was very tasty and easy to eat since they're on small skewers. The pancit palabok was delicious served with real calamansi. The lechon belly was...well, let's just say I couldn't stop eating it! They do not have a very big menu but everything in it are Filipino favorites. They also have daily specials. I can't believe I just learned about this place. I live just 10 to 15 minutes from here. We had a nice chat with Erno's (the owner) parents Nora & Bing. Wonderful couple! Erno himself who greeted us as we walked in is the typical respectful, welcoming, smiling Pinoy. Great experience! It was like walking into a typical Filipino home where you're welcomed and treated like family and served the best dishes. And like a typical Filipino get together, we ended up staying longer than necessary having enjoyed our chat with Bing & Nora. A \"must visit\" for all Pinoys and everyone else. \"I shall return.\""}
{"text":"Finally a Filipino spot in Henderson! The BBQ sticks are tender, juicy, and very yummy! We tried the chicken & pork and both were very good, the pork I like better because you can taste more of the marinade. They have daily specials too and the day I went in it was Sinigang! It was the bomb! Not oily, sour, and meat was falling off the bone. I love how their food isn't oily. I met Tita Nora and had to tell her how happy we were with food. The Sinigang should be part of the regular menu because it's really good! I hardly get to eat home cooked Filipino food unless I see my parents, so this is nice. The whole family there is so friendly and welcoming, especially the owner Erno. That certainly sticks out. The menu features Filipino favorites and the garlic rice and halo halo are on point!!! Thanks guys, keep up the good work, and I am definitely going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"best Filipino spot in henderson hands down. Best flavors  and it reminds me of my moms cooking. Me and my man will be eating here at least 2 times a week."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food was delicious, the staff was super friendly. The owner even came out and chatted with my husband and me. Family owned, authentic, delicious food. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Owners were so welcoming!! Loved their Bay Area sports attire. I came in with my mom for a halo halo but they didn't let me leave without sampling their bbq fresh off the grill! And if I wasn't already full I would've stayed for a whole plate. Halo halo was way better than the one at Thelma's as they were very generous with the ube ice cream which is my favorite! Definitely coming back for a plate next time"}
{"text":"I am a 77 year old well traveled \"honky\" partial to CHINESE & VIETNAMESE food. Am not crazy about KOREAN or FILIPINO food but took my FILIPINA wife to this place 3pm today (6/7/18) and tried the PORK BAR-B-Q and PANCIT. We loved everything about this little place near the GALAXY CINEMA on SUNSET. Food, cleanliness, family atmosphere and prices were excellent. This is the best FILIPINO food I've ever had anywhere. My wife was likewise impressed. So, don't waste any more time looking for a great FILIPINO RESTAURANT here in VEGAS, this is the place!"}
{"text":"The BBQ pork steaks! YUM!!  Giving a warm welcome to this Filipino restaurant.  Manila BBQ is located next to the Green Valley Luxury Theater.   How confident!  After a movie swing by for lunch or dinner.    This place has a small menu, which is great for me.   The more items I have to choose from the more confused I get about what I want.  Then comes the indecisiveness.   We ordered the BBQ chicken skewer plate, the BBQ pork skewer plate,  Shanghai lumpia, pan it, and halohalo. Both the skewer plates came with two scoops of red rice and potato salad.   The red rice was almost like ganduli rice which is a Portuguese rice.    We got to meet the owner.   Sweet Filipino aunty who was so kind.  You can tell she enjoyed cooking.   It showed up in the flavors.   I will definitely be back.   Two thumps up!"}
{"text":"Their bbq and Filipino food is delicious! I noticed this family restaurant with my family when we came to watch movies at the theater next to it. The staff is friendly.  Try their lumpia and milkfish with garlic rice! It's my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing Shirley B check in several times.  Seems like a family business.  Everyone was super friendly.  One of the women working asked if I was familiar with filipino food and explained some of the desserts.  I got the chicken bbq plate with an extra side of garlic rice and an order of lumpia.  I placed my order, ran down to Smiths and when I came back it was ready for me.  The ride home was torture it smelled so good.  Once home dug in and everything was delicious.  Even my husband and kids who \"didn't want any\" couldn't quit sneaking bites.  Prices are inexpensive.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly owners! The food is soooooooo good! Found my new eatery every time in Vegas. I can not rave about this place enough."}
{"text":"I was here today, thought we try it out and i got the tapsilog which is amazing, just wish the serving is a little bit more, will be back definitely!"}
{"text":"A yes place for ethnic foods. Pinoy food nicely done. Good pinoy ambiance. Even non pinoys love to dine here. Keep it up . this place looks great in food and service"}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent food especially the Pork BBQ, Pansit Malabon, Tapsilog, & Tinapasilog. I love the atsara and chicken macaroni salad too.  They also have daily specials, but it was sold out. Apparently, they only make one pot. Once it's gone, it's gone. The prices are also great. Honestly, they should charge more.   Cons: They should open one in Seattle, WA."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Clean place, friendly staff, excellent food. Will definitely go back. Had the chicken bbq and beef lumpia. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday afternoon, I was very fortunate to interview Nora the restaurateur, of the now very famous MANILA BBQ, while taking a brief break from attending the big crowds, some were regular customers, the rest are newbies eager to try The Filipino foods Manila BBQ is to offer.    The question is, \"what is the secret why MANILA BBQ dishes are consistently good? Hehehe, kaya nga secret di ba? Nora the owner, proudly whispered to me that it took her years to develop sauce (s) for her recipes. Nurturing her Mom's and Grandma's recipes, improving them more through trial and error until she developed recipes that she calls her own. Which now are safely guarded not even her children can access to it.     Waking up as early as 4 am everyday, she personally make ready the main ingredients; a chore she does not mind as long as her restaurant's customers will be happy and satisfied of the foods MANILA BBQ offers. The taste is consistently good unlike other Filipino restaurant where the food is... now it is good, next day it is not.    This is purely my opinion, but then try it and you will not be disappointed. You will say SUPERMAN is true after all.    Bye now, SHAZZAM...."}
{"text":"Recommended by friends...glad I tried it! If you love Filipino bbq and Guam red rice, you all need to try this place in Henderson. Food tastes great, courteous staff, portions are just right, and price is very affordable. The owners ate Nora and kuya Bing introduced me to their entire staff including their chef, kuya Mike, and their son, kuya Ferno. We tried their pork/chicken bbq, korean short ribs, redrice, mac salad and their atsara. They were superb in taste. All meats were juicy and tender. I will definitely be coming back soon to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"The owner and wife are very friendly and there are some very interesting photos and articles about them on the wall. The food however, is just okay. I had the Chicken BBQ with garlic rice, garlic wings, and the chicken macaroni salad. The portions were a bit small for the price, the Mac salad had too much mayonnaise, the garlic rice was not that much different that any other rice, and the garlic wings were just gross and oily. They told me that they make everything fresh unlike other places where there are trays of stuff laid out and you point to what you want. I don't doubt that, but it all was just okay. I don't know if I'll go back, although I still want to try out their pancit and the red sausage things that I forgot the name of."}
{"text":"I was excited for this place to open and I finally got the chance to try their food. This place has the potential. I like that it's not fast food, they make it when you order it. Menu is a little short but looks good. I want to try everything here. So, on my first visit we tried tapsilog, pork & chix bbq, and palabok to-go. It was pretty good- I'll come back for these again but palabok (pancit malabon) was a let down. Presentation was on point but flavor was lacking. I knew right away that something was missing and on my next visit I told them what happened. They apologized but blamed it on the new people working in the back ( I thought this was family owned, guess not?!).  I'll try this place again and hope that it only gets better. Place is clean but maybe interior needs a little bit more attention.  So, I wrote a review and apparently based on that I'm a scammer. I was hoping to update this review in the future with more stars... but I don't think I will come back here. Good luck!!!"}
{"text":"Manila BBQ is  my home away from home , Great food, clean, and great service. Nora and Bing Formento generously shares their food know how and their warm hospitality which adds to the charm  and aura  .Located in a very nice area it is easy to find.  The food is affordable and delicious. The presentation is simple but delightful. The portions are big too. Hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"What do Manila BBQ's menu and JC's disciples have in common? They both come in 12. No bread and red wine here, but they do have bangsilog and red rice. Close enough! Whether for breakfast, lunch, or supper... it doesn't have to be your last meal. (Just remember they are closed on Sundays.)  Manila BBQ sits in a prime location between Galaxy Theatres and Barley's. I was actually surprised to see a Filipino restaurant secure this space. It's fast-casual, so you place your order at the counter and then wait since everything's made to order.  Ambiance: Even though the paint colors subtly reflect those on the Philippine flag, the overall interior is a little lacking and dull. There is great potential for wall decor, especially from a country with such distinct tapestry.   Service is friendly and extra attentive which is understandable for a newer business. I've only tried a few entrees, but here's my verdict so far:  -- Between the chicken BBQ and pork BBQ, the latter definitely tastes better. I'm a chicken girl, but for this one instance I'm team pork.  -- The side of macaroni salad is not my favorite. It's a little too sweet for my liking and doesn't complement the entree. It just ends up forgotten in my refrigerator.  -- The tapsilog is comparable to nearby Filipino places and comes with atchara. I remember the meat being a little too dry, but I ordered it the first week they opened so it may have gotten better.  -- First time I've had red rice. Digging it!  -- Regardless if it's for here or to-go, they'll serve you in styrofoam boxes. It would be nice if there were plates for dining in. More environmentally friendly?  Overall, this place is close to home and eliminates the need for me to drive to Seafood City."}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp after a plane ride. Here in Vegas for a ceremony and hungry enough for a brunch.  Food was delicious, simple Menu and that's best for me.  I had the pork bbq coupled with two scoops of red rice and macaroni salad.  Hubby had the palabok which was cooked perfectly with real calamansi (lime-like) served. He also had tapsilog. Baby girl had the vigansilog which, according to the cook, real mixed recipe since owner comes from VIGAN, Philippines.  Owners were real friendly and very accommodating. We will be back and definitely spread the news to friends."}
{"text":"Oh em gee! I thank the other yelpers for their reviews here. Everything is sooo delicious! Their #4 Beef Tapsilog is the bombastic! Chicken bbq is on point. Service is outstanding & the owners are amazing! Great to meet the family. I gotta come back to this place. More food to try and add on this review"}
{"text":"Tasty stuff has a fairly small menus so you can be assured that whatever you order will be the best version of it."}
{"text":"Good food great service. Everything we had was delicious. Pancit, lumpia, bbq were amazing. We shared it all and it disappeared fast. This will be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Masarap!!  We had basically everything lol it was so good! Fresh and full of flavor!!  Right up there with Lola's cooking"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas from LA 7 months ago, and I'm so happy that I finally found my go to Filipino restaurant. I had their BBQ chicken today and it was delicious. Also, everyone is extremely friendly which is another plus. I definitely will be going back, and will have to try their Filipino spaghetti on my next visit."}
{"text":"Manila BBQ engaged my senses as soon as I stepped in on Monday. I had a few seconds to take in its bright, cheerful colors while the aroma of delicious Filipino food enveloped me. At the same time, the team warmly greeted me with smiles. As you can imagine, I felt the good vibes right off the bat.  The menu had what I was looking for. Although it was not really large, it was helpful for indecisive people like me. You've seen the type - the ones holding up the lines. They flip flop two or three times while you silently wish they'd hurry up.  Enticing entrées, sides, drink and dessert offerings. All at affordable prices. With great anticipation, I was ready to eat. In fact,  I should say, \"We were ready.\" You see, my hubby, who's not used to Filipino food, was willing to come because I had been talking about it for days. It'd be interesting to find out how he fared.  Having grown up in the Philippines, I am actually quite familiar with Filipino food. But my husband has other preferences. He would yearn for Chinese when we traveled. No matter the destinations, it'd be Chinese first unless it was nowhere to be found. Can you believe that we searched for Chinese dishes in Ashland, Oregon way back in 1993 when a sudden snowstorm stranded travelers on I-5? We had to take the nearest exit to look for food and lodging for the night. Luckily, a restaurant attached to a gas station was open for dinner. On the menu: an interesting mix of hamburgers, spaghetti, chili con carne, ... chow mein and Chinese fried rice.   Eureka? Not exactly. Not even close to being Chinese food. As hubby put it, \"It's better than nothing.\" So you'd understand why I was concerned. What would he think of this Filipino food that I heard is delicious?  They say that a couple who enjoys food together stays together. We've been married more than four decades. Not wanting to take any chances, I pored over the Yelp Filipino food reviews beforehand.  What did we order? Chicken BBQ Plate, Pork BBQ Plate and Pancit Guisado to start. Let's see if we'd leave enough room for Halo Halo dessert afterwards.  So what did my man think? He was satisfied. \"It was great,\" he declared. Would he want to come back again? Sure! Now, our thoughts on what we ate:  * Chicken BBQ Plate Fantastic texture and taste. The 4 chicken barbecue skewers were moist and flavorful. The cup of macaroni salad was mildly tangy and lightly sweet. Barely-there seasonings make the 2 scoops of red rice the perfect accompaniment for the chicken skewers.    * Pork BBQ Plate Wow, that glaze on the pork barbecue! Tender and juicy meat enhanced with garlic-vinegar dipping sauce. Perfect ratio of lean & fat. This combo of 4 pork barbecue skewers, a macaroni salad and 2 scoops of red rice looked as pictured on the menu board, unlike what shows up at some pizza ads.  * Pancit Guisado: Beautifully presented. Delicate rice noodles with morsels of chicken. Generously garnished with julienne carrots and chopped green onions. Its appetizing aroma heightened my enjoyment.  * Halo Halo: Tantalizing photo on their social media. Irresistible, I must add. The royal-purple ube ice cream alone was reason to want it. This healthful ube yam is rich in antioxidants. It's awfully tempting, but we were already full. So it's delayed gratification until the next visit.  * Chicharon and Adobong Mani: It was a treat to take these snacks home. Crunchy and fresh. I'm enjoying the peanuts as I'm finishing this review.  What we ate were indeed palate-pleasers. The special marinades, sauces, and seasonings from their secret recipes had infused the chicken, pork, and noodles with an aroma and a taste decidedly unforgettable.   Overall, it was a great experience for us. What would make it even greater? Melodic Filipino music in the background. For this visit, Manila BBQ deserved 5 stars. Delicious food. Affordable prices. Friendly, efficient service. Comfortable, casual environment. Clean rest facility. All met or exceeded our expectations.  At long last, there's little need to order Chinese food for hubby on our return to Henderson. We'll just head on over to Manila BBQ for more of Nora's Filipino specialties. We'd frequent this resto more if it weren't for the distance. This is 500 miles from home. It's not exactly a do-able driving distance for two seniors.  Tip #1: Get the classic Filipino dessert Halo Halo when you come here. It's a wonderful wrap-up for a delightful meal.  Tip #2: Check out the ready-to-go Filipino delicacies on the counter. Take home some chicharon, adobong peanuts, kutsinta, puto, biko and sapin-sapin for breakfast and afternoon snacks.    Tip #3: Ask about the daily specials. Filipino spaghetti, dinuguan, menudo na baboy, kare-kare, etc. cooked the way your Mom would."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and the portion size was very disappointing! 2 scoops of red rice (no taste) and 3 pieces of short ribs for $9.95! Sorry, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I finally found a place for Filipino food that's close to the house.  They're a new restaurant and already they're operating well..I'm a fan!  Manila service: It took about 10 minutes to get my #1 combo (chicken bbq sticks) after ordering. All the staff I came across were so friendly and gave a great vibe.  Happy eating time at Manila BBQ.  Manila cuisine:  My chicken bbq sticks were very tasty.  The sauce was savory and it paired well with the red rice and potato salad.  The combo meals are served in a Styrofoam container with a lid which makes it convenient to bring food home. The cashier area has lined with lots of yummy Filipino dessert delicacies already wrapped to go for you.  I see what you did there, excellent. =)  Manila ambiance: A casual open dining area that's very clean with mobile tables in case you need to push them together for a larger group.  The posted menu showcases the combos and prices clearly to make ordering easy.    If you're familiar with Teriyaki madness, this is the flavorful Filipino version of that for me.  The food is tasty, they pack it ready to go (I'm always on the go) and their price point is similar if not cheaper than Panda Express.  The Filipino desserts offered is icing on the cake.  I'm looking forward to trying more combo dishes but that's another Yelp tale. Enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"I found Manila BBQ on Yelp Friday morning and came in for lunch Friday afternoon. The menu is not huge so it took me almost no time at all to order a combo #1 (BBQ chicken, 2 scoops of red rice and a scoop of macaroni salad). I also wanted an order of lumpia.  It took less than 10 minutes for my food to come out. Not bad. The lumpia came out first and let me tell you they were blazing hot. Super crisp. A little over cooked and bordering on burnt but not at all bad tasting. With a little of that sweet chili sauce for dipping they went down real easy.  Next up came my meal. There were 4 chicken skewers in a clam shell box with the 2 scoops of rice and a small cup of mac salad. The chicken was tender and grilled to perfection. The flavor was slightly sweet and a little salty. A good balance. They shined with a drizzle of the garlic vinegar on the table. The rice was good. Not as strongly flavored as some red rice I've had. It still stained the styrofoam and form. And finally the mac salad. A little strange if I am being honest. It was creamy like Hawaiian style but I am pretty sure there was chicken in it. That threw me off. It wasn't bad but certainly not expected.  Good food. Good service. Average pricing. Kind of small. The TV with shows in Tagalog is a little loud. But Manila BBQ is alright in my book. Not a bad new spot."}
{"text":"BBQ pork and BBQ chicken are their signature eats when I come here. It reminds me of fresh street food eats. The taste is well balanced and delicious. The #6-lumpia is another favorite for me. The #10-Bihon Guisado was tasty, but a little greasy. The #9-Pansit Malabon with Shrimp was a good noodle dish. The garlic rice was okay. The chicken mac was tasty. The service is friendly and be advised that this place just opened recently and the wait was about 25 minutes for all we ordered."}
{"text":"I must say that I'm a huge fan of this Filipino food spot. They had me hooked from the moment I walked in the front door. The cashier was so friendly & helpful to address any menu questions I had. I ordered a #4 combo plate (beef, rice, and two over easy eggs) along with a #10 pansit (chicken with thin noodles, similar to chow mein, but so much better) and #6 lumpia (beef egg rolls). Service was fast and everything tasted delicious! Their portions are so large! I was stuffed and was glad I decided to take my food to go so I had plenty of leftovers to indulge in when I got hungry again later that afternoon.   One thing I did notice was that although this place has only been open for a short time, there's already a steady group of regulars who know the employees and cooks on a first name basis. At one point, an employee even came out of the kitchen and greeted a customer with a warm hug. Definitely a fan of their family friendly vibes. That's rare to find nowadays.   If you're in the henderson area and looking for a delicious authentic Filipino food meal, you must stop in and try this place. I for one will definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"this is definitely a must try.. we ordered chicken bbq and longsilog..its definitely a bomb.. bbq is excellently marinated and very tender.. macaroni salad and achara on the side are also good. will definitely come back and invite my friends.. love the hospitality too"}
{"text":"This new place is a gem. We recently got back from our trip from Hawaii and have been looking for awesome authentic island food and this place def has it. I ordered the pork BBQ skewers and my boyfriend ordered the pancit plate. We also shared an order of Lumpia which was mouth watering. My boyfriend also got thai tea which complemented his dinner wonderfully. The staff is very friendly and this place is very clean. I highly recommend and would give this place 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"First time trying this today and let me say... this is where I will be going to get my palabok fix. Their palabok is the best I've ever tasted ! Usually in other restaurants the palabok is watery and they only give you the packet lemon, Manila bbqs palabok is soooo good and full of flavor and I love how they put fresh calamansi with it instead the packet. The cashier was very friendly too which made my first visit comfortable. Please don't ever change how you make your palabok!! It was perfect today ."}
{"text":"The most friendly staff! They make you feel so welcomed. You HAVE to treat yourself to the Halo Halo with ice cream, it's perfect to cool you off on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Ate here like two weeks ago, almost close to closing time so many of their items were out. BUT, what I wanted was still available so I was totally fine with it! I ordered beef tapsilog, which I hadn't had in the longest time so I couldn't wait!   It's served with garlic rice, achara and an egg (cooked to your preference). Everything is pretty much made to order so it takes a little to get your order but everything turned out great. The only down side to the meal was that my egg was waaaaay too over cooked, I ordered it sunny-side up and I got it close to a hard boiled egg. There was no runny yolk!   The beef was tender and well marinated and cooked. It was savory and delicious! PLUS!! the house made achara was AMAZING! I loved the achara, I would buy a container of that by itself!   There were a few kinks of with the place but it's a working process! I loved what I ordered. The ordering and payment process was flawed and they were still learning how to use their POS system. But that's one of the only downsides of my experience."}
{"text":"So happy this place is finally open!  I loved everything.  I had the longanisa, garlic fried rice, and an over easy egg which was delicious!  Also tried the special for the day which was sinegang super sour just like i love it!  I then had the halo halo which was a perfect treat for the end of my meal.  Nora the cook was super nice and amazing.  The owner Arro (spelling) was so inviting.  I definitely will be back, and will make sure to send people here for authentic Filipino homecooking."}
{"text":"Staff are very welcoming and super nice.  The lechon is super crispy, and the kids lovrd the bbq chicken! The owner even gave us sinigang on the house! Was really sweet of them. Cant wait to come back and try their Pancit Malabon!"}
{"text":"Came here at the suggestion of a friend to try it out.  Definitely walking in, you are greeted by a very cheery cashier. Very Filipino welcoming vibe as you come in. And the smell, you just get hit right away and it just reminded me of home cooking.  My friend ordered for us: pancit bihon, pork bbq plate, chicken bbq plate and mini lumpia bites.  For the bbq plates, you get 2 very generous scoops of their red rice, 5 pieces of the bbq skewers and pineapple macaroni salad. The marinade was just the right enough sweetness for me without it being too over powering. The portions are definitely more than enough to split for 2 comfortably, but it'll be a very light meal if split. You get a side of pineapple macaroni salad. It is just a personal preference of mine that I don't eat sweet macaroni salads. I'm just a plain old jane, with the pasta, mayo onions, salt, pepper and eggs (like Hawaiian Mac salad).   The pancit was great in portion, but for my tastes it needed more seasoning and acid. The lemon wedge provided was not enough acidity.  Lumpia bites were decent but I am never a fan of mini bites. Even at the now non-existent White Rabbit, I am and still will never be a fan of mini lumpias. Lumpias I like are the ones with meat and vegetables. These mini ones are always just meat only.  The only downside, but I know how to get around it for next time, is that the rice is red rice. I have never been a fan of red rice and never will be. Just something about the taste puts me off. Even at the other local restaurant called Red Rice, I was not a fan of. Just a personal preference. However, their red rice reminded me of valenciana (Filipino paella), but the grains were separate and not sticky.   Service was great. Very friendly staff. Met the owner: Mama Nora. Very \"tita\" vibe for sure. Price was great. All three plates and appetizer for 2 cost $26 after tax, so definitely a steal for the prize and you get a lot of food.  Next visit that I need to try because I am a down right bangus (milkfish) fan, is the bangsilog. They debone a young milkfish and serve it with rice and eggs. Definite breakfast staple. I will ignore my fish allergy and still try it.   They also carry a limited amount of Pampangan Bakery Items available to purchase."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food! Great bbq  owners are very sweet. Affordable prices for good Filipino food."}
{"text":"Food was good, impeccable customer service. Love a good mom and pop place, especially one that truly cares about their customers. I'll come back just for the great experience!"}
{"text":"It was a few days ago that we had dine-in.  We were very pleased and excited that we found a Filipino restaurant close by and actually serve red rice :) being from Guam made me happy. Two thumbs up!!!  Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. Food was so yummilicious. My family were all full and satisfied. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Saw this place pop up on Yelp and knew I had to check it out. It's located near the Galaxy Green Valley movie theatres. Ordered the longsilog with garlic rice and the pork bbq with red rice but subbed the mac salad for the atsara.   The pork bbq came with 4 bbq sticks but they were smaller than the usual bbq sticks you'd find at other Filipino restaurants. I'd say the 4 you get in their serving is equivalent to getting 2 sticks somewhere else, which is still a good serving size. The marinade on the pork bbq was really good - had a nice balance of salty and sweet. The red rice was good, similar to the Chamorro red rice. I really liked the atsara. It had chunks of garlic and ginger in it and complimented the pork well.   The longsilog was ok. The overeasy egg was cooked perfectly and the garlic rice had great flavor. But the longanisa wasn't my favorite. It was juicy and cooked just right. But, it had some kind of Chinese five spice flavor going on that was a little off putting for me.   The staff/owners were super friendly and the service was quick. I'll be back to try other items. Not bad for the new kid on the block."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting here as i was looking for a Filipino Restaurant close to my house so i went to try it.  The Parking is not desirable, the ambiance of the store is alright, but the staffs here is really friendly. I ordered the Pork Barbeque, Lumpia Shanghai, Spaghetti and Halo-Halo.   The Barbeque and Lumpia Shanghai was very good, but the Spaghetti was not what i expected. You can see on my posted  picture the spaghetti.  The sauce is very light, not much taste and just a tiny bit of ingredients.  I know this is a filipino food, but cooking spaghetti in philippines you have a lot of sauce, cheese, hotdogs and meat, but there spaghetti is very dry and should have more sauce and ingredients.   Their Halo-Halo is average not much taste, more ingredients are needed more milk and a less ice. The food is bit pricey compared to other filipino restaurants .I really want to like this place but I am not impressed so far with their food. I don't know If I will  go back but i guess i should try them again to be fair."}

{"text":"I've been waiting for them to open since I saw the signs....and now they are!! Solid 4.5 stars.   Stopped in Monday evening after golfing around 7pm. Located near the Galaxy Theatre on Sunset and Green Valley Parkway. When you walk in you are warmly greeted at a counter, where the menu is posted on the wall with photos, as well as individual menus. This is not a fine dining establishment but more set up for take out. I counted 7 tables for 4 inside so it won't be a place for large groups to dine in.  It was pretty busy when I was there, 5 of the 7 tables were occupied. Casual dining atmosphere.  Nice selection of various filipino dishes. I had Pancit bihon and beef lumpia rolls that I picked up for take out. Both were well prepared and tasted great. I look forward to trying the chicken BBQ next.   One thing that stood out is the owner, Nora, who came out and sat with me briefly while I waited on the food. She was very nice and welcoming, and explained a little about the menu (her personal favorites along with popular choices from previous restaurants). I wish her much success.  Pricing seems to be great, very fair and portions are good. I got a lot of food for $12. They will also do large orders, either 1/2 or full pans.   I can only see this place getting better as they go on. Support local businesses!!"}
