{"text":"My partner and I have ordered delivery from Sunshine Pizza a few times. It's better than the average pizza chain in Calgary, but it's certainly not the best we've had. Most recently we ordered two 12\" (large) pizzas: one ham and pineapple and one pepperoni and bacon. The total (with delivery about 6.5km away) came to $29. Not super cheap, but not the worst. The pizza came piping hot. The ham was very good, but the crusts on both pizzas were overcooked and almost as hard as a rock. Both my partner and I found a few small black hairs cooked into the toppings, which doesn't really bother us, but may be a major turnoff for others (perhaps time to invest in a hair net). My partner would give it a solid 4/5 for the taste, and I would agree there, but I don't think the value quite warrants a 4/5 - so a 3/5 it is."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had. The crust is perfect. The toppings can be hit or miss depending on who is making it that day, but it is always good. The price is very low, especially considering the quality. Free delivery on orders of over $15 within 5k. They have gotten our order wrong a few times though so make sure they take it down right."}
{"text":"I dont undersand why this place gets good reviews. My boyfriend loves the place but when we have pizza night i geta second pizza elsewere for me. If you like burt cheese, then I can see why you love it. There medium pizza is smaller then a med from Dominos, but more expensive.The actual building where the pizza is made doesnt even look like a resturant... more like an office."}
