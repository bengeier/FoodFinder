{"text":"I'm fairly new to the thin-crust pizza scene, and this place really didn't do it for me.

A friend told me about this place, so I checked it out with a couple buddies last Friday evening. After an hour waiting for a table (expected, considering we just walked in at 7pm on a Friday), our server ran down the specials, and pretty much the whole menu. Very friendly, though a bit tough to hear in the smaller, crowded environment. 

I went for the Salami pizza, which arrived at the table quicker than expected. Unfortunately, I was not pleased with how quickly the thin crust can get soggy upon saucing and piling on toppings. This point alone dropped my rating to 3 stars. I've heard mixed reviews about the crust, but my buddies and I all agreed that it was just way to soggy for us. 

I did, however, find a fix for the soggy pizza - take some home in a doggybag, reheat in the oven, and it's the delicious taste of the pizza, with a better crust.

I doubt I'll return to this Pizzeria - next to try is Terroni's."}
{"text":"The design of the newest Libretto is very nice. The ceilings are high and the room feels very spacious. The bar is very impressive with 8 beer taps coming out of a wall of marble.

There is a large area outside the restaurant that I really hope is going to turn into patio this summer.

The pizza is trademark Libretto. Our group shared the cremini mushroom and the cacciatore salami pizzas. I preferred the cremini with the rosemary and gorgonzola adding a strong flavour punch. The negative with the mushroom pizza is the crust tends to get a bit mushy. 

My friends had two salads to start, the beet caprese and the arugula. Both are pretty generous sizes and my friends said they were very flavourful.

A negative is the cost of the beer. A 14oz pour is $7. This is the reason for only 3 stars. I think 16oz would be a bit more reasonable, if not 18oz. I get that the location is in the financial core, but that still seems overpriced."}
{"text":"Arrived during a lull in their day, between rushes. Service was friendly and prompt. Great pizza, decent beer selection (considering Canada), and incredible dipping oil for some bread that appeared at our table before the pie arrived. A thoroughly enjoyable lunch experience."}
{"text":"Everybody! Please join me in welcoming Pizza Libretto to the Era of.....I dunno what to call this? Firstly, not a shot at the waiter, reservation takers (simply following orders presumably) BUT someone in mgmnt has decided it's perfectly fine to pre-qualify the duration of your stay?!!  In all my years having business lunches downtown  (over 20yrs stuffing my face in business district eateries) I have NEVER been asked \"to leave because the table is reserved for 1:15\".  The fact I'm  getting older may be that my hearing is going but in this case when I asked the young lady to repeat herself she triumphantly repeated herself loud and clear - stuff yourself and get lost Mr!!

Lets role play restaurant goers! We got approximately 1hr to settle in, order drinks, appetizers, mains, dessert/cafe and check out. Plenty of time correct? Unless your name has Hoover in it or you're romantically interested in indigestion not enough time. 

As for the food, meh. Good but not WHOA! \"I gotta eat here again\". You want thin crust, special flour that wont make your girdle burst and lets not forget its baked in some ancient Italian oven that is licensed by some authority we all couldn't give a hoot about! Oh! The maker of the pie prepped presumably by a pizza artist known only in their world (why would the average Joe know about a guy who can flop a pizza pie together?) So, ok ya, maybe I'm  jealous whatever. It's PIZZA people! Yes, better than fast food pizza but...it's  still ZAH!!!

Pizza Libretto - Join the line with the rest of the neo pizza joints popping up everywhere like it's some kind of privilege to eat.  ALERT! IT'S NOT.  Maybe now everybody is pumped to have a go at your stuff but with choice readily available in the downtown core, I have chosen to spend my business lunch money elsewhere. 

(Yes visualize me taking my soccer ball and going home leaving all yall to twiddle your thumbs )"}
{"text":"My party of 7 must have gone on an off day because on the hottest day of the year so far, the ac was out and our main dishes (pizzas and salads) took 40 mins... AFTER the appetizers... To arrive.

On the other hand, our server was very attentive and apologetic throughout. Everything we ordered was very delicious.. Even the bread! One of my favourite would be the fried gnocchis but we also had the spiedinis, calamari as well as a few pizzas. I was looking forward to the Rocco Salad... But unfortunately we found they out of eggs (?!) so I guess I'll have to try again. 

We went for our friend birthday and they were able to make it special by serving her gelato (it's all she wanted)  a nice bday message. The downsize was that that took about 30 mins. I was warned 3 times when making the reservation that we'd only get 2.5 hours for our meal but that's moot after all the delays. 

Again, I'm going to assume it's an off day for the kitchen but if I go again, I'll make sure I'm not too hungry just in case."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice atmosphere, friendly service.  Go on a weeknight or weekend afternoon when it's far less busy.  The warm olive plate appetizer is amazing.  

Cannot believe the reviewer complaining that the server offered their table wine when she was pregnant (the HORROR).  I  went when I was pregnant and was personally not put off at all when the server offered me wine.  I'm pretty sure i'm an adult who can make my own choices,  pregnant or not."}
{"text":"I love Pizzeria Libretto.  A friend and I went looking for food at around 4:30 Sunday afternoon, we heading for Get Real on Ossington but it was closing when we arrived.  We continued on and decided we would try Pizzeria Libretto.  I do love pizza, it is probably my favorite food so I thought a nice thin crust pizza would be fab.  When looking at the menu the waitress pointed out the Price Fix special which was an excellent deal for $25, let me review.  It started with Mixed Bruschetta, we had 3 pieces with different toppings, a eggplant curry topping,  fiore di latte with fennel and a goat cheese with chives.  Delicious!!  Then we shared our appetizers, a caprese salad of heirloom tomatoes with fiore di latte and an amazing vegetarian pea soup.  Up next was the pizza, my friend ordered the Wild Mushroom and I had the Rapini, we did exchange a slice or two and both were delicious.  We ordered them with the Spelt crust and we were shocked that the crust was actually spelt since it had a very light taste and texture, more like you would expect from a wheat crust, it was really, really good.  Our deserts were Strawberries with Zabalione and my favorite Panna Cotta with Blueberries.  The Panna Cotta was so light and tastey, I have learned it is a custard made with gelatin instead of eggs.

So it is funny, we went looking for a late lunch and ended up having an amazing 4 course dinner!  I really enjoyed it, the ingredients are very fresh and light tasting (and local), the d√©cor great and our waitress was very nice. There wasn't anything to not like including the price, all that for $25 each. We arrived right before the dinner rush so we didn't have to wait in line and we had our choice of seats.  I would definatley go back (including taking my chef sister from Kingston to see what she thought) but I would probably stick to the off peak hours as it was getting really busy by dinner time."}
{"text":"Was here late last year and am sorry to say I wasn't thrilled with it! I had very high expectations given the reputation and expansion of the brand. Ambiance was vibrant which I enjoyed but the food underwhelmed me. I love neopolitan style pizza and thankfully there's a lot of options in the city. 

They have all the right components here (italian tomatoes, quality house cheese, high gluten flour for the pizza) but I was missing a chew and a slight crisp in the crust. We shared the prosciutto appetizer and some olives to start, then I went with the \"house-made sausage\" pizza. It was a white pizza with caramelized onion, mozzarella and chili oil. Ingredients were tasty but the crust was just too soft, dare I say a bit soggy. Wine list was solid and we enjoyed a nice bottle of primitivo. No dessert on this occasion.

I would like to go back and give the calamari appetizer a try, it looks pretty delicious on yelp. I'll let you know if my review improves."}
{"text":"It's hard to find something wrong with Pizza Libretto. I currently live near the Ossington and Dundas area so when I feel like a baller and wanting to opt out of a standard grease pie a la Dominos/Pizza Hut/ Pizza Pizza I will normally call Libretto and order pickup. i usually go with the Ontario Prosciutto and add on their pepperoni made in house. The chili sauce that the pizza comes with is solid and should be requested. They do Neopolitan style stone oven pizza that if doing pickup, can literally have a pie ready for you as soon as 5 - 8 min after you order. My only real issue is the price. I would get Libretto everytime I crave pizza if it wasn't for the 23 bucks I have to shell out for something that only feeds one person. If this were Dominos, 25 bucks gives you a feast that will feed over three people (including their delicious ranch sauce). Like I said though, this place is so good and is certainly a step above the greasy fast food pizza joints that have polluted the industry."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been to the one on the Danforth more than I can count. I've been to the one on Ossington and I felt that it didn't have the same atmosphere as on the one on Danforth. It's easily a great place for a date of 2 or for a larger group of 8 to 10 people if you make a reservation. The service is always good. For a starter, I love Rocco's Salad. The fried calamari is also great. For pizza, I prefer the House-made Sausage pizza and the Cremini mushroom pizza (for those who really like mushrooms). The tiramisu is the best I've ever had. The panna cotta is also great and is a lighter dessert choice."}
{"text":"The meal was incredible! Very authentic Italian Pizza cooked perfectly with the freshest ingrediants! Always a pleasure eating here."}
{"text":"Libretto serves the best pizza I've had in Toronto. It's proper, thin-crust, Italian style pizza made with local ingredients (when possible) and cooked to perfection in an oven made specially for them in Italy. 

I ordered the prix-fixe menu which at $25 for 4 courses is a good deal. The chef's bruschetta of the day had some peppers and soft cheese and was delicious. I had the arugula salad which was good yet simple and nothing to write home about. The margherita pizza was the real star of the evening. It was thin, the perfect size, just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and basil, and I want another one right now just thinking about it. For dessert I had the tiramisu which was homemade, not too sweet but with a rich coffee flavour. Just the way I like it.

Our server was pleasant, knowledgeable about the menu, and very patient with the table next to us as they asked him questions for about 5 minutes regarding which pizza they should order. 

I knew we would have to wait for a table so I mentally prepared myself before we left the house. After arriving, leaving our number, and being told it would be a 45min wait, I was pleasantly surprised to get the call only about 15min later. 

I will definitely go back to Libretto and have already recommended the place to my friends."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, and what? You guessed it. Amazing! My favourite go-to restaurant. Delicious pizza (the duck confit is to die for), great selection of wines, trendy vibe and ambiance. And a heavenly tiramisu to finish with. What part of that does not sound like the perfect dinner out?"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had in a while.  Just really good.  I had heard there was a long wait, but it honestly wasn't bad.  We went across the street to get a drink and we'd barely been served before my cell phone rang.  Try the eggplant pizza!"}
{"text":":) I had a nice little meal at the bar. My server Kristen who was also tending the bar was super nice and attentive. 

Despite it being stat holiday (Good Friday) this place was super busy! Lot of young professionals living around the neighborhood. A lot of cute guys ;)

Complementary bread basket was good, nice and hard crust, soft middle, arancini was good, and my margherita pizza was excellent. The dough is something else here.

Manager was super nice too. Everyone was friendly and kind. Great service.

So glad I finally decided to try it out and I have one more restaurant now in rotation!"}
{"text":"Wow! Yasssss to this delicious pizza and yassss to the delicious calamari. 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place and I have been here on numerous occasions.

I love the super thin crust and the fresh ingredients. My personal fave is the prosciutto and arugula. The staff has always been very friendly and attentive. The reason why my review is not a 5/5 is due to waiting for a table. I wish they took reservations so I can enjoy pizza without the long wait."}
{"text":"Another update. Why not.

I've flipped flopped a few times as to whether it's the best pizza I know in the city, but I think my final conclusion is that Libretto pizza is better by a very large margin. There's good competition, and part of it is your taste in pizza, but I think that a) what it is is amazing and b) it's consistent--the kitchen delivers the same product consistently.

What you might not know, however, is that somewhere back in the kitchen there is a frustrated covert tapas chef and pastry/dessert chef (possibly the same person) who creates original beautiful small dishes (appetizers) and gorgeous desserts and gelato. For a while there, back in the day ;) were new creations monthly but the menu seems to have stabilized in this regard. Must be torture for her/him.

The appetizers are really worth trying (all of them) and anything that's special--just order it. Libretto is where I first encountered panna cotta that was soft subtle and like ice cream that forgot to melt. Nothing like the slightly stiff gelatinous stiff texture you can sometimes encounter at other restaurants. Not always on the menu, but worth ordering. Special gelato? Order it. Affogato? Ditto. 

That is all."}
{"text":"Great pies and specialty cocktails. They also have a spicy oil sauce that's pretty interesting. Not real pleased with the service but that was typical of many of the places downtown."}
{"text":"Order the margarita specialty and duck confit and sausage pizza. Same with all the other reviews. Flavor is good but the crust is too soggy. Wish the owner would actually read the reviews and make some changes."}
{"text":"Took about 20 minutes just to get the complementary bread, then another half an hour to be served our pizza which was cold and SOGGY and incorrect toppings Waiter was not attentive at all. This place definitely has potential but  there's better places in the area."}
{"text":"This is a very popular and happening pizzeria on Ossington. We got there at about 8:30 pm and were told it would take about an hour for a table. We expected that there would be a wait and went across the street for drinks while we waited. (There are tons of bars around the restaurant to have a drink while waiting.) I order the meatballs and the margarita pizza. Both were very good. There was also a nice selection of reasonably-priced wine. Overall a very nice place to have dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Pizzeria Libretto three times now.  The first time it was great.  We shared a pizza and a salad and had some beers and got to sit at one of the communal tables.  It was actually my first communal dining experience since eating at Wagama in London in 2001 and it was fun.  Our second trip to the restaurant was sort of meh, not great, but not bad.  But last night, hooo boy was it awesome! Our waiter was great, he was totally cool that our friend took forever to join us and then couldn't make it, never getting mad that we had two people at a table for four.  Though it was sort of early and there were tables available for other people to sit at.  
We had the gnocchi, oh my, that is a fantasy worthy plate.  We loved the texture, sauce and asparagus, yum.  Our salad was tastier than last time and they didn't have any issues with our substitutions.  The sausage pizza was delightful, salty and sweet, with chili oil.  We really couldn't stop talking about how good it was."}
{"text":"Good meal, but not off the charts amazing.  I'm not sure any pizza is worth waiting an hour and a half for.  If i could walk right in, i would defintely rate it higher.  I went again with 4 people in total and they refused to even put our name down on a Saturday night.  They said they were only seating three max per table."}
{"text":"Pizza is far from great. The crust is awful. Decor and stuff is ok but let's face it, the food is mediocre. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but great experiences at Libretto's two other restaurants, but my first dinner at the University location was disappointing.

The problem was the pizza. While a traditional Neapolitan pizza can have charred edges and a slightly undercooked centre, what we were served was a disaster. Three of the five pies our table ordered weren't cooked properly. Some slices were completely burnt on the underside, while slices on the same pizza were undercooked to the point where the cheese hadn't fully melted. For a place that specializes in pizza, this is unacceptable. 

Service was friendly but seemed unconcerned about our complaints. They offered to bring us new pizzas, but since most of them were poorly cooked in the first place, we didn't trust the new ones would be any better.

Salads, bread, and desserts were outstanding as expected from this chain.

I may give this location another chance, but I will favour Pizzeria Libretto's Ossington and Danforth restaurants if I'm in the mood for their pizza."}
{"text":"I ate here today on my Birthday. These folks know how to serve you and most of all they cook the best pizza ever!"}
{"text":"The gnocchi appetizer with nduja will have you craving to forgo all acceptable social behaviours and lick the plate clean. Pizza is always great, and the service is really above par. I'm always contented to spend my money and time here."}
{"text":"I have to say, I am a little bit taken back by the people that are giving this place a full 5-star review.  

I mean, yes, the pizza was great.  I will echo what others have said on here for the most part.  Crust was nice and delicate, yet still had a new chewiness to it.  Sauce was nice and tangy, with nice herbal note from the oregano.  The basil was slightly killed in the oven... but I am knit picking here.

The salads had a lot of non-typical ingredients, which made it interesting--lots of different textures.  The meatball was very soft, although it could have been served a bit warmer.

They offer house sparkling water, for $3 a bottle.  I thought this was nice a brilliant touch.  Nice to have something gassy with heavy food.  And a lot better than spending the big bucks for name brand sparkling waters.

So why do I give this place only 4 stars?  Well, for starters, they do not accept reservations.  And waiting for an hour to get in, while it is raining outside, was not fun.  Then once even when you are in, you are sardined in the second line up inside.  You have to constantly dodge people.  

The problem, I thought, was because front of the house people did not quite know what was going on in the dining room.  Empty tables sat there for too long before it was taken advantage of.

The parking in the area sucks too.  Sure, this is not exactly the restaurant's fault, but nonetheless, they chose the location, and it does affect the experience.  

Finally, there is the price.  Okay, so $12 or something like that for a smallish pizza that will serve one person is not the worst thing I have ever heard (knowing the fact that this is a gourmet pizzeria).  Having said that, when you look at what you are eating... dough... a bit of tomato sauce... basil.. and the sparring use of cheese.. you begin to wonder about the value.  

But then again.... the place is packed.  And people are willing to pay.  :)

(BTW, try making your own authentic pizza at home--I followed directions in Heston Blumenthal's show, and it came out just as good, if not better than Pizzeria Libretto's)"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in the city. Libretto's doesn't take reservations, so planning to go here is always a matter of figuring out when it will be the least busy."}
{"text":"So you know a place is going to be amazing when there's an hour wait an hour and a half before it closes. 
I decided to bring a friend here after a show at Roy Thompson Hall thinking that it wouldn't be packed. Wrong. We were the last people they put on their waiting list before cutting everyone else off. Win. 
We waited an hour so by the time we sat we knew exactly what we were going to order: 
1) Porcini Mushroom, Grana Padano Cheese, Hazelnuts, Mixed Greens, Balsamic Reduction salad ($12) - so flavourful with a lot of mushrooms (I love mushrooms) and chopped hazelnuts. I'm not a huge salad person but I really enjoyed this one. 
2) Duck Confit Pizza ($17) - I had to order this again since I mentioned it so many times to my friend. Just as good as the first time I had it. Chunks of delicious, delicious duck with a sweet kick from the bosc pears.  
3) Grilled Eggplant, Tomato, Basil, Chili Flake, Ricotta Salata ($12) - tasted really fresh and light compared to the duck which was nice. I didn't taste too much of the chili flakes so I added more.

Considering we were seated at 10:30pm (they close at 11), we weren't rushed and the service was consistent throughout.  Will be back and will try to refrain from ordering the duck confit pizza again (...but it's SO good!)."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR TAKEOUT PIZZA:  

I ordered the 'Grilled Eggplant, Tomato, Basil, Chili Flakes, Ricotta Salata'.  They took less that 10 minutes to prepare the pizza. Pizza was very fresh, thin-crust and the edges of the pizza were not to thick.  The tomato- sauce base was delicious, I could smell the fresh basil and the eggplant was very tasty.  It had a spicy kick to it but thankfully it was not overwhelming.  It was accompanied with some chilli oil on the side.

Pizza was not oily or drowning in cheese, you could definitely taste the flavors.  The day before I had had a similar pizza from The Cheesecake Factory (in Buffalo) and I would say hands down the pizza from Libretto was far superior.  For $15 its definitely worth going back for.  

Service. I was parked outside and my meter was just about to run out so the cashier actually came out to give me my pizza (once I had paid) - what a nice thing to do!

Parking:  Parking is not the best round here.  On Sunday there is free parking until 1pm but  afterwards its $2 per hour at the meter."}
{"text":"Amusing breed! (May be we were hungry) Crispy fried calamari! Best fired risotto balls I have ever had! You have to try it.... Excellent pizzas! Need to book a table."}
{"text":"The most awesome Duck Confit/pear/mushroom  pizza ever!
Haven't tried the Margaritta pizza at Torito yet, but really liked the margharitta pizza here.

Nice atmosphere, fun in a group if you can get here early enough for dinner"}
{"text":"When I saw the menu I have got so confused by the amount of ingredients that I wasn't hungry anymore... I think this place is trying so hard to fit too many palates, that it's working for them.
I ordered the calamari with the pepper sauce, just because is sounded insane, and it was. The combination is overwhelming, and the overpowering of the peppers just killed the saggy calamari... I ordered a pizza after that, and I now understand why they bring a complimentary bottle of water... so you can swallow the most chewy dough I have ever had. I am closing this libretto for ever..."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

I LOVE pizza and pizza libretto did not disappoint. I might even go as far and say that in my experience this is the best pizza in the city! 

we got there at 10 pm on a Wednesday and there was still a great vibe in the place. great service, fantastic food and a fun atmosphere...what more could 3 girls ask for? 

oh yeah and we had warm olives to start, which were fabulously flavorful!"}
{"text":"easily the best pizza in Toronto. it's probably stuck at 3.5 stars because of wieners who complain about the wait (you know most restaurants are open on days other than fri and sat, right?)

yes it was busy when I went, we were given a shitty bar seat right beside another group of patrons but good thing the taps were directly infront of us (can't remember if there was a good selection or not). I was heavily buzzed and lost my mind slightly when the pizza came because it was so good. crispy outside, chewy inside. fresh as fuck ingredients and toppings. i honestly could have been sitting on a bed of nails and wouldve forgotten, this is a restaurant focused on food and not so much setting (although they do that fine). 

your tastebuds are defective if you rated this place lower than 4."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined at Pizzeria Libretto on Ossington last Wednesday around 1 o'clock. We did not know how long of a wait to expect during lunchtime on a Wednesday. Luckily, we were seated right away.

The two of us ordered the Buttermilk Fried Calamari, the Flank Steak Spiedini, the Grilled Octopus, and a House-Made Sausage Pizza. (We were hungry...to say the least.) While waiting for the appetizers, we enjoyed some house-made sourdough and focaccia bread (the best!) with a balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and chili oil dip. The chili oil was delicious...

The Buttermilk Fried Calamari was decent. The batter was not too heavy and the red pepper almond sauce was interesting, but I felt this dish was plated and tasted better at the University location.

The Flank Steak Spiedini was the winner of all the appetizers. The order came with three skewers. The steak was well-seasoned and tender, paired with toasted focaccia bread. Mmm...

Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the Grilled Octopus. It was grilled perfectly (while my friend expected it to be a little crispier on the outside), but the entire dish was incredibly salty...especially the potatoes. It was a huge disappointment...

The House-Made Sausage Pizza totally made up for the above. Keep in mind, Pizzeria Libretto serves Neapolitan pizzas, and these are thin-crust pizzas. This pizza is made up of only four ingredients; it is simple but it tasted great! Did I already mention the chili oil was delicious..? :)

My friend and I spent quite some time, eating and chatting away. All the while, our friendly server checked on us every now and then, and filled our glasses. It was a very casual dining experience, and the food was pretty good (minus the Grilled Octopus). I know this location is \"the place where the magic started\" but I'm interested in trying their other locations to see if there are any differences...especially since I'm only ever in the area to try something new."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Went for lunch with a girlfriend. Shared the arugula salad and meatball pizza (special of the day). Food was amazing. Ambiance was a little loud...hard to hear each other talking. Waiter was super nice. They have Blur Sky cola...never heard of it before but quite good. Not as sweet as regular Coke."}
{"text":"I only gave this a four star not because of the food but because of the unbelievable wait time. Thankfully I live in the hood so have learned when to and not to go - please go off hours. Don't even bother trying during peak times or on weekend. You won't get in without a 30-50 min wait and will walk away disappointed. This is not a great date place. It's loud and a bit manic. OK, now on to the food. 
I CRAVE this pizza. I usually get either the Margherita or the Mushroom pizza. The Margherita is melt in your mouth good with a nice combo of basil and cheese. The Mushroom is tangy and sweet and quite rich. The pizza sizes are a bit odd. They are too big for single serve and too small to share and be satisfied. If I'm not sharing, I usually end up with a doggy bag.  I'm surprised to see that the ratings on yelp aren't higher; although I think the process of getting in may drop the rating significantly."}
{"text":"Pizzas with thin crust and made on wood oven! As a Brazilian I was missing it. The closer you can get from a S√£o Paulo's legit pizza."}
{"text":"When I first heard there was a place serving authentic style Italian pizza I was thrilled!  I have spent a great deal of time in Italy and LOVE their pizza.  

I was expecting a crisp, thin, charcoaled crust and instead it was thin, yes, but soggy!  The toppings were fresh and delicious but it's the whole package and I was not thoroughly impressed.

It's still better than most but given all the fanfare... I was expecting more!"}
{"text":"Thanks to my friend Rose who brought me to this fantastic pizza place in my new hood. A lot of places claim to have thin crusted pizza but don't really. Pizzeria Libretto is the closest thin crust pizza i've had since visiting Italy. It's amazing! Definitely the best pizza i've had in Toronto!

I had the Marinara pizza (Tomato, Garlic, Oregano and added mozarella) and Rose had the Margherita pizza (Tomato, Basil, with extra Mozzarella). They were both super tasty. 

This place is always packed, but we didn't have to wait since we were only two. The service is incredibly fast and pleasant and the prices are completly reasonable.

I'll definitely be going back to this place - many times i'm sure."}
{"text":"Looking at my reviews star graph, and it shows no 4-star, and I'm thinking, really, there's no place where I think food and service are pretty all right, then Piz Lib pops straightaway into mind.

PIZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZAS (3 - 3.5 stars)

It's not Rome or Naples quality, but, ya know, for fancy Toronto pizza, it's pretty decent, no complaints, quattro is fine, sausage, sides,apps all fine, really, how hard is this stuff, as long as ya got the oven and good ingredients.

SERVICE AND VIBE (5 stars)

Ya see, this is where front of house manager makes all the difference.  The place is packed, packed, packed, man, even PAC MAN can't eat enough standbys to get in on a Fri/Sat night, before they opened up second location, do they finally take reservations at Oz location now?  Think they do.

But I just love the vibe at this place, the staff, the energy, it's casual, but the service is precise, pro, hipster, certainly, but these guys are late 20s, 30s, some pushing or past 40, and this is their livelihood, man, these are pro service guys and gal.  Real pride and great on execution.  Freakin samurai warriors and that lone goddess of a FOH manager.

Always, always have a good time here, dates and groups.  Really like the lighting too, is it funk or is it just well-lit for ambience and scoping out your date's rack ... of lamb.

Gotta visit the Danforth loc at some point.  Pics of interior looks faaaaaaaantastic."}
{"text":"The day that Libretto stood for new delicious Italian cuisine are long gone. Now its just another chain selling mediocre food. Been to the University Avenue location a couple of weeks ago, and was deeply disappointed.  The food was ok, not much more, which you can get cheaper and better elsewhere. The service was pathetic, it was quite clear that the team couldn't care less about the patrons. I was served the wrong dish (annoying, but it happens) but it was basically slammed on the table by the server who immediately disappeared, and any attempts to catch them or any other server's attention just failed. It ended with me getting off the table, walking inside with the plate, handing it to a server and explaining that its the wrong dish. This has yet to happen to me till then, but I saw no other way to get my order in fashionable manner. Needless to say, no one thought they should apologize. They simply didn't care.
Won't come back."}
{"text":"Totally worth all the hype. Went with a friend on a Wednesday night and waited about 20mins to sit at the bar. If we had longer to wait, we would have left our contact info and gone for a drink elsewhere while waiting for the text/call (lots of bars in the area). They had a 25$ prix fix on: crostini (mozarella and prosciutto with gardenaire), starter (tomato or arugula salad -so good with the portion of walnuts and pears), ANY pizza off their regular menu (we went with ngula sausage and mushroom and each loved it), and mini panacotta topped with granola and cherry sauce. You pay $1 for endless sparkling water. Love love love the crust on their pizza. Perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent Neapolitan pizza, worthy of the name. Slightly less rise to the dough than some of the other Neapolitan options around but still one of the best pies anywhere; it is just about on par with Italian and French traditional restaurants, in Europe.  Similar to Il Dolce, in Costa Mesa, CA and Pizza e Vino, in Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, though the margarita is superior here.  I have not been to the Obika in Toronto, but the one in LA is actually in some ways comparable with Libretto."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city. Pistachio gelato with ginger cookies was the perfect dessert to end the meal. Staff are friendly and attentive.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just returned from Naples where we had a lot of great pizza and to be honest we missed it here in Toronto.  Libretto nails it!

Went here on a weekend and got the fixed price lunch - what a deal!  The salad was great and pizza reminded us of Italy.  Throw in a desert and you've got a winner.  The restaurant was also very well managed.  I say this because we went to Queen Margherita Pizza and have seen how not to do it.  The pizza also blows Queen Margherita out of the water.  

Thank you Libretto"}
{"text":"So over rated. Their pizza toppings are not the best combinations......just can't understand why people are like sheep and line up for mediocre fare...."}
{"text":"Not sure I went to the same Pizzeria Libretto as so many others here. It is true that it is authentically Italian. I had the worst pizza of my life just outside of Rome (Italians wont be surprised, but may debate if that qualifies it as Italian). Not so sure that it is authentically Neopolitan, cos then it would be better...

And this pizza is authentically bad. They hauled that wood burning oven all the way from Italy just to make a soggy crust that also manages to be burnt? Ma-don-na! My nonna made a better crust in her 1972 GE tin can...

The mixed drinks were good, the starters were decent, the bartender was cute AND funny, the waiter was insipid, the acoustics sucked, and the other patrons didnt seem to see the emperor has no clothes...

Toronto hype...got to love it."}
{"text":"Been twice. Yeah it's good. Nice pizza, great crust. But the pizzas can be \"runny\" and reach the point where they all taste the same. Still a worthwhile try. 
First time we went it was great, second, so-so.
Service is good, kind of casual, but attentive. Atmosphere varies depending on where you sit. Try to get inside the restaurant. 
Pizza recommendation: The Margaharita"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto. I keep coming back again and again. I typically don't get an appetizer but have tried all the pizzas and love them all. I like the wine list and limited beer selections (local craft beers). I come for the pizza but I never leave without getting the tiramisu. It is the best I have had anywhere. Its creamy, the cake bits are spongy and the espresso flavor is just the right intensity. It has always been packed when I've come, lunch or dinner, so it can be a little noisy but the atmosphere is high energy and the servers are all amazing (very helpful with wine selection). They don't take reservations but the wait is worth it, and the bar across the street has a nice local beer selection."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, tried the Proscuitto/Arugala pizza, Duck Confit with Bosk Pear and the House Made Sausage pizza. My favourite was the house made sausage...had a little bit of a kick with the chilli oil. The pizza is very thin crust napolian style and has more quality toppings then your run of the mill pizza places. I find it a bit pricey for a regular lunch downtown though, at $20 there are better places to get a quick bite in the financial district."}
{"text":"This place is amazing you get certified authentic Neopolitain pizza fresh from there wood burning oven."}
{"text":"Ok so I know I'm a little late on this one. What can I say that hasn't been said here? I went for my first pizzaria libretto experience last Friday. It was completely rammed but we managed to get a seat at the bar for the two of us after about 20 minutes. We got the calamari which was amazing! Perfectly done. I got the duck confit pizza and it was unbelievable. The service was amazing and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pizza crust is thin and the ingredients are fresh.  I liked it overall, but it seemed a tad expensive for my liking."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. We had the margherita pizza as... well I absolutely love margheritas. (Makes sharing pizzas hard as it's all I'll eat at a traditional Italian pizza restaurant). 

We had a wait of around 45 minutes - they take your number and call you when the table is ready so you don't have to actually stand in line for hours. This is a great idea and hopefully they'll keep doing this. 

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the atmosphere and ambiance. Our table was squished between two others and all we could hear were the two ladies on either side talking about their lives. Makes it difficult to have a lovely and relaxing meal. 

That said - I think if you wait for a counter spot or booth your experience would be significantly improved. So if you're going here and are on a date or wanting a quiet dinner, maybe try hold out for one of these.

Comparing this to Terroni's - which is my favourite pizza place in Toronto - I have to say the food here wins, however it loses on ambiance. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5 which I've given to Terroni's. I'd actually prefer to give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars. It's not good enough to get 4 stars, but not bad enough to get 3 stars. Pizza Libretto is known for its super yummy pizza, so I was disappointed to get a mushroom pizza with a nice crust, but which got progressively soggier toward the middle. The toppings were nicely seasoned, but a bit undercooked, which added to the gummy, undercooked taste. The calamari appetizer was much tastier, as was the arugula salad, although the latter was a bit small for the price. The wine was decent. The service was nice - our waitress was very accommodating and had no issues splitting our bill according to what we each ordered. I'd try this place again, but wouldn't be jumping to go back immediately."}
{"text":"In regard to rate a pizza, i choose always the margarita at first. This is what i did at my stay last year. And i have to say that it was one of the best pizzas ive ever had! And this although i traveld more than ten times through italy and tried a lot of pizzas. This one is able to keep up. Maybe because of its certified original neapolitan recipe ;) 
Ps. I had the margarita pizza with \"mozzarella di bufala\""}
{"text":"Pizzeria libretto is great! Forget about the hype. The food is yummy and the place is super cool. The crowds are a bit of a pain, but I always go off peak (Wednesday night?) and usually have no problem getting a table. The prices are surprisingly reasonable considering the hype."}
{"text":"Three words: duck. on. pizza. I haven't had a chance to try a lot of things on their menu, but the Neapolitan style duck confit, with pear and mozzarella pizza, really did it for me. Like a lot. We visited the Ossington location twice now, and we haven't been disappointed. 

They seem to have a reasonably sized wine line, but I opted for Peroni, a lager brewed in Italy."}
{"text":"Had the Buttermilk calamari which was delicious, very unique flavour with red pepper pur√©e sauce. 
Also had the duck confit pizza, with sweet gingered pear and Gorgonzola cheese, perfect combination of flavours. My favourite was the prosciutto and arugula pizza, also very flavourful. 

I had the espresso cinnamon gelato which was delicious with very intense flavour. Also on special pistachio gelato which was very creamy. 

Would go here again and again."}
{"text":"- Lively, cozy atmosphere, friendly stuff 
- Interesting pizza

- Limited menu
- Long wait for weekend (60-90 mins)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto. I only give 5 stars when it blows my mind and Libretto does! Only wish is that there were a few less hipsters around, but comes with the neighbourhood,"}
{"text":"Outside of the wait for a table, this place has my heart.  I've tried most of the small plates and a couple of the pizzas.  This is my go to place when I don't want to risk a new resto.  

The servers I've had have all been really friendly and helpful.  

When they have pepperoni on the menu, get it, the pepperoni is homemade and a bit spicy.  

Such good quality toppings, and a crust that is beyond perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I will definitely be going back to try another pizza! For a starter, we got the calamari which was amazing- perfectly battered and a great sauce to dip. We got two pizzas between the two of us and ended up taking about 2 or 3 slices home for left overs. One of the pizzas was the eggplant (fried eggplant, tomatoes, basil, herbs, mozzarella, and a lot of whipped ricotta), and the other was the cremini muchroom (buffalo mozzarella, gorgonzola, roasted garlic, herbs, pecorino). Out of the two pizzas, the cremini was my favourite- if you are a big fan of both mushroom and cheese, you'll enjoy this pizza because it is packed full of those flavours. The eggplant pizza was great, but not comparable to the mushroom pizza. I found that there was too much sauce and whipped ricotta on the pizza which made the middle of the pizza soggy. Overall, the food and service were great and I would definitely go back to try other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed our experience here. Three of us split two pizzas and a salad, leaving us all satisified. The kale salad was tender and the dressing had a little bit of spice. We also had the eggplant pizza with a great taste. Our server, Morgan, recommended the special, a lasagna pizza which we normally wouldn't order, but glad we did. The red sauce is light with a little bit if kick.

Morgan, the server, was fantastic. Very attentive and personable, providing suggestions for a trip. I will return next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went straight to the bar and grabbed the only two seats remaining on a Friday night.  I was just to the right of the taps, which sadly, only had three options: Creemore, Steamwhistle, and something else I can't remember.  Okay, I went for the food and not the beer, but it would have been nice to get a cold Stella! Plus, way too much head on my Creemore.

So, I ordered the Sardine Pizza, but was soon told they were out of Sardines.  SO DISAPPOINTING.  Got the Hot Pepper / Homemade Sausage instead, and was very surprised.  The dough was slightly crisped but just rubbery enough, and the sauce was all about the tomato.  Simple and effective without drowning in extra spices and flavours.

The ring of crust around the edge was a little too puffy and crisp for my liking - but we had our own chili-oil bottle in front of us to keep it moist.

Service wasn't the best, but it was a very busy night and the lineup was out the door.

I will definitely go back for the pizza, I just hope the 2nd time around they have stocked SARDINES."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner - it was busy, but service was great, and the food came fast!  The pepperoni pizza was great, but my favourite was the buttermilk calamari!  Mmmm, delicious!!  ^_^  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you like your pizza dough soggy, go to Libretto. At the suggestion of our waiter, we had the sausage pizza, which is apparently one of the most popular pizzas on the menu. The crust was so wet (not sure if it was because of grease or olive oil), that we could hardly cut it. It was bland and tasted really rubbery. The pear salad I had to start, on the other hand, was good -- temperature appropriate, well sized, and very fresh, as were the warm olives. 

The service was just okay -- our waiter certainly did not go out of his way to be friendly or helpful in any way.

I was really excited to try Libretto, what with the incessant hype about the place, but I've honestly had better pizza at Pizza Nova. In short, get over yourself, Libretto."}
{"text":"Second time here.  I was brought here by friends who heard the pizza here was really good, and then brought here again by accident by someone else who heard the same thing.  We've all agreed that it's not that good.

Is it even a pizza crust here? It tastes like a cross between a pita and nann bread. It's super soggy from the toppings.  It reminds me of emergency pizza you make at home by throwing cheese and meat on a big pita bread and bake for 15 minutes.

$16 for a pita topped with sausage and hot peppers. Pass. =(

Service was not a problem. Crowd is a mix, but many older people (40+) enjoying wine. 

Manhatten? No they can not make one here. =("}
{"text":"Came here at supper time on a Saturday with my husband. It was not (yet) busy but was more lively than most other places in the financial district. We shared a squash - arugula salad and had a pizza each ( potato for me and a sausage one for the hubby). The salad was good but I was not blown away by the pizza. We also shared the Nutella donuts for dessert and they were tasty. I didn't like this place as much as Mercatto but the location is convenient so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Good service. The pizzas were fantastic and so was their wine selection. Must recommended place for anyone who loves thin crust gourmet pizzas. Even the penne was quite good."}
{"text":"Easily the best gourmet pizzeria I've been to so far in the city. Been there several times and tried pretty much every pizza on the menu and they were all fantastic. Arrive early, put your name on the wait list and head to a bar close by for a drink before dinner."}
{"text":"Great for delicious pizza that is sitting in front of you in just a matter of minutes. They take pride in their Neapolitan style pizza - and for a good reason. I recommend Duck Confit pizza. The arugula pear salad is great too. It is a popular place and they deserve it."}
{"text":"5 stars for service! Food is great too...but the service, wow!  Let's start with, letting us in before they opened, an army of people to help with a baby stroller, even though we didn't ask and the same treatment when we left, and overall awesomeness from the server, friendly but not distracting, never in the way and there when you need them.  So much more to say.  Why go to Terroni with its all too cool attitude when you got Libertto and better food too.  Also ordered take out from the university location before, how great is it when they prioritize your order when you tell them your wife is already on her way to pick it up, again I didn't even ask, they offered!  Class act across the whole organization"}
{"text":"Great pizza place. The weekday lunch prix fixe is a steal! You must try the espresso gelato."}
{"text":"I think the best thing here is not their pizza.... i like thin crust that are crispy, but peronally think their type of thin crust is too moist for me. However what I rated them for is their service. Excellent service, I've never seen such a passionate server! Also the vanilla ice cream with espresso shot was amazing!"}
{"text":"My go to restaurant for many reasons: 
Food is consistent and delicious. I have tried almost everything on the menu and recommend the burrata, any pizza w/gorgonzola, the rocco salad and the calamari. Drinks, especially wine, are reasonable priced. 
I used to be a fairly regular (several times a month) customer at Terroni but I have not gone back there for years. Not only is the pizza at Libretto tastier, you won't find any snootiness about the menu. They are extremely accommodating about allergies and preferences. The front of house service is fantastic. The staff always remember us from previous visits and they are super friendly and helpful. It gets busy sometimes, I just go have a drink at the Crooked Star across the street and Libretto calls when the table is ready. I always feel like they appreciate our business."}
{"text":"Came to this location for Mother's Day! Plenty of seating, and a different atmosphere from the Ossington location (less of an intimate feeling - higher ceilings, etc) but the food was still good! 

I still love the duck confit pizza from PL!"}
{"text":"The lunch pre fixe is unmatched in Toronto.  Get it with the caprese salad.  The pizza here is hard to beat and the service and atmosphere are delightful."}
{"text":"I love pizza, but apparently I'm not a huge fan of Neapolitan pizza.  I just don't really like the chewy/soggy of the middle of the pizza.  Though, I did enjoy my meal here and we only had to wait about 45mins to get a table on a Friday night.  

Started with the risotto balls, which would have been even tastier had they been served piping hot. They were just warm, but the idea was there.  

As for the pizza selections, there are the standards but I thought I'd go for something a wee bit different and ordered the duck confit pizza.  The duck was tender, delicious and plentiful.  The pears were great and the presence of fresh rosemary (my favourite spice) perfectly complemented everything.  

I only had room to eat half the pizza, as the risotto balls were pretty filling, so took the rest home for leftovers.  I usually love cold leftover pizza for brekky in the morning, but I felt like squishy Neapolitan pizza would be fairly gross cold, so chucked it in the oven for a bit.  Oh man, THEN it became super delicious....nice crispy crust!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto. Expect to wait a long time for a table, but well worth it. Great service."}
{"text":"Having seen Libretto recently heralded as the best pizza joint in Toronto in a local paper, I had to give it a try.  So tonight was the night.

My friend and I ate early (about 6:30), seating for 2 wasn't an issue.  I had the spicy sausage pizza on the regular thin crust.  The service was pretty good, and so was the pizza.   But I have to say the disparity between the 'top pizza joint' and others such as Terroni, isn't huge.  That said, the last 5% does make a difference.  Tomato sauce was bursting with flavour, the mozzarella tasted almost like fresh mozzarella di bufala, and the sausage was spicy but not over-powering.  Chili oil was very flavourful.  Overall, it was a good experience.

As a side note though, in this city, best pizza usually assumes it's thin crust.  I love thin crust pizza, but would it kill us to have a decent new york style pizza joint in this town?  Sometimes thin crust just won't do."}
{"text":"Infinitely better than Terroni's (which we feel is over-rated and too inflexible about their menu, splitting bills, even refusing to provide balsamic vinegar)! Pizza Libretto is the best pizza we've had in Toronto!  The pizza with prosciutto and arugula was the best. The pizza with salami and gorgonzola was also good (although the salami was a little salty). The Margherita pizza was also good, but we preferred the meat options. Excellent bruschetta, but would skip on the calamari, which was nothing special. All the ingredients were incredibly fresh."}
{"text":"I am sure it has been said a million times over, but if I could give 6 stars to only one restaurant in Toronto... Libretto would be worthy of my extra star.  

The food, the staff, and the atmosphere all combine euphorically to make for a consistently epic and memorable experience. 

The food I cannot rave enough about.  The appetizers are bold and doused with traditional Italian flavours of garlic and olive oil served with perfectly toasted crostini.

My go-to salad is always the Walnut, Pear and Arugula which I highly recommend.

I have tried a few varieties of the pizza's and they have always been cooked to perfection offering a chewy and crisp crust topped with fresh, melted buffalo mozzarella cheese.

Finally, the big finish is the tiramisu every single time.  Creamy... decadent and so perfectly indulgent.  

The staff is always helpful and absolutely energetic - they truly share and drive your Libretto experience.  It is a warm and inviting atmosphere surrounded by amazing food... very much like a giant Italian family feast! 

The wait is always at least 45 minutes, but there are so many wonderful bars in the area that after a few drinks, you are only that much happier to eat at Libretto."}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza in Toronto!

Great crust, interesting fresh toppings and super service!"}
{"text":"Tough to find a truly proper pizza in Toronto.  Terroni continues to be a benchmark, but Libretto is definitely a contender.  Good atmosphere in a fun location.  The only downside is the wait is insane"}
{"text":"I actually wish that Libretto was more poorly reviewed on Yelp.  In fact, I am tempted to change my rating to 1 star just to skew the average down, and hope against all hope that maybe, just maybe it will tilt the rating to the point where less people will go...

You see, Pizzeria Libretto is kinda like an indie band.  A little band that makes great music, you can rave about them to your friends, play them songs that they've never heard of before, maybe you even know the bassist!  But if they get too popular, well you've got a problem.  This cute little indie band you've been keeping in your pocket now is no longer yours.  You must now share them.

So I dream of showing up every day for supper, maybe even twice on special occasions... When I walk in all the wait staff look up and we share some secret greeting ritual, they only show me the specials that they know I'll love, and if I see the chef, I call him \"Rocco\"....

However, the fact of the matter is that I do not live anywhere near enough to provide them with enough business that anything remotely approaching my Libretto-fantasy.  And it must also be admitted that a large part of its charm is how packed it always is, sharing a table with a complete stranger is a fun experience every now and then.

There may be other \"real Neopolitan pizza\" joints in town now, but there is a certain charm, a particular Roman twinkle to Pizzeria Libretto that marries a very grounded downtown hipster vibe, wholesome and fresh local-ish ingredients, and classic Italian cuisine, at a ridiculously affordable price.  (I've decided to use the word \"ridiculous\" at least once in all of my reviews)

Oh, and I'll share a little secret with you, gentle reader-- if ever you show up and it is PACKED (usually the way it is around supper time), the girl will take your name and phone number.  She will also probably tell you that there is some ridiculous wait, like 1 hr.  Here is the secret-- she is most likely LYING.  Ok, that is a strong word.  She isn't lying.  But things change quickly.  People that are ahead of you give up and end up going somewhere else (yay!  or maybe not yay).  The key is to stick around somewhere really close, a great new option is Agostino's Enoteca Sociale just down the road on Dundas just west of Ossington.  Hang out, have a quick glass of wine, and before you know it, your phone will ring, usually well before the Hostess of Doom-and-Gloom predicted.

So I guess I have to live with the fact that Pizzeria Libretto is not ever going to be my little secret.  But, I'm OK with that, just as long as you don't start calling my chef \"Rocco\"!!!"}
{"text":"The fried gnocchi were pillows of goodness with an awesome creamy flavour with their distinct outer crust. These gnocchi will make you go on a carb diet. And due to their executive chefs out of the stratosphere creativity I give these a 10/10 on the delicious gnocchi scale. I hope you enjoy them too.

{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto is probably one of my favourite pizza restaurants in the city. I've been here a few times for dinner and I always love what I order. Today I went during the lunch hour and was able to take advantage of the fixed price lunch special, which comes with a salad, margherita or marinara pizza and a dessert for $15. The salad was a huge portion of arugula, walnuts, and sliced pear with a light olive oil dressing. The wood-oven pizza is thin crust, with blackened edges and topped with lots of tomato sauce (yum) and a few circles of melted mozzarella. I had a scoop of chocolate gelato for dessert.

In the past, I've ordered the mushroom pizza (white pizza with lots of mushrooms), and the roasted eggplant with ricotta salata. The eggplant is probably my favourite. The eggplant is nice and spicy and the ricotta is a bit lighter and less oily than the margherita pizzas. The salads and appetizers also always seem to change with the season. I've had a few different salads that were also excellent - a calabrese salad with heirloom tomatoes in the summer and an arugula/apple salad in the fall.  

The only potential downside is that it's always very busy during the dinner hour and they don't take reservations. They also won't seat you unless your whole party has arrived, so make sure you go early! Lunch is a lot less busy - we had no problem getting a table at noon."}
{"text":"I was here on the weekend and I was not impressed by their pizza.  It was chewy, wet in the middle, and was burnt on several areas.  I also looked around to make sure I wasn't the only one who experienced this, and I wasn't.  Having been to other pizza establishments that have the 'authentic' Neopolitan pizza making standard, the pizza I had at Pizza Libretto is vastly overated. 
Ironically, the appetizers and other items on the menu were actually very good and the wine was excellent.  So, I would say that everything but the pizza was great."}
{"text":"This is the bad Pizzeria Libretto location. I am a longtime fan of the Pizzeria Libretto locations on Danforth and Ossington. When the University location opened I was really happy with the quality of food and service. But the King Street location keeps letting me down, time and time again. The pizzas just don't have the depth of flavour that I'm expecting. Service is spotty, often slow and moody. In a recent eight-person dinner, reserved in advance, the server was downright confrontational and antagonistic from the first time she approached the table until the very end. Don't let expansion kill your quality, Pizzeria Libretto!"}

{"text":"Really creative menu with lots of fun pizza options. The gnocchi was a great dish for sharing. The service was so-so, but they were very busy so it was hard to get anyone's attention."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city by far. 

This place deserves all the accolades and fuss. Yes, there are lines, yes, you will have to wait, and no, they do not take reservations. But its all worth it. 

My go-to pizza is the classic Margherita pizza. Classic and simple, with a really tasty tomato sauce (tastes like tomato sauce should taste, acidy, super fresh, no tomato paste after taste). buffalo mozzarella (huge creamy clumps) and a handful of fresh basil. Cooked in a flown-in- from-Italy oven at 900 degrees, the thin crust pizzas cook in about 90 seconds. Crazy, right?

Also love their pizza with heaps of salty proscuitto, garlic, tomato, shaved parmesan and a handful of fresh arugula thrown on top after the pizza is baked (see photo).


Another menu item that's pure gold is the Buttermilk Calamari, crispy deep-fried rings of soft calamari over a red pepper & almond sauce (as well as a bit of pesto and good quality olive oil). 

Service is always friendly yet efficient as well plus the decor of the resto is super cool. 

Note: Their lunch pre-fix menu is the best value going: $15 for a pizza, salad (caprese or green) & a small dessert of gelato or biscotti is a steal (pizza's run $13 to $18)....

Libretto. Please don't change. You have hit the perfect formula of casual dining, high quality, delicious food at a really good price.

Note x2: Danforth location slated to open in the early fall."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so I remember coming here when they first opened, it was completely hyped so my experience was a little fogged.  I returned with a few friends for their prix fix menu for lunch and this time had an excellent experience.  I can't believe how good of a deal it is.  

The appetizers are excellent I had the beet caprese salad, for main I actually got the piadina of the day which was excellent as well, filled with high quality ingredients.  The bonus was my friends didn't finish their pizza so I got to have some pizza as well which was also excellent.  For dessert I had this delicious cinnamon coffee gelato that I'll be looking for at my favorite gelato places and hope they will have it. 

 Overall it was a great experience.  Both food and service was excellent and I will be making any excuse now to go, especially for the lunch special."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some girlfriends and I was really impressed with how tasty the pizzas were. I don't usually have thin crust pizza so I was pleasantly surprised. My only complaint is that I was hungry after a couple hours!"}
{"text":"great pizzeria, italianstyle.

great atmosphere, but ALWAYS busy.

good wines as well...."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST! and my favorite pizza resto.

I'm going to keep this review simple - just like this restaurant.

It's amazing!

Food is consistently delicious.
Atmosphere is amazing - it can get loud, but that's because people are having a great time.
The staff and service is A+.
Italian Bomb pizza is a special they have time to time - if you happen to be there when they have it - try it!
Drinks are awesome too. Ask for Coke - and try their hipster alternative - its good!

If your social - you will have a great time.
If your on a date - you'll win points for picking this place.
If you want to make it up to your girl for messing something up - she'll forgive you.
Want to kick it with your boys or girls - you'll love it here."}
{"text":"When I came back from Rome, I was jonesing for a delicious wood fired pizza like the one I had at Dar Poeta. Google led me to Pizzeria Libretto.

Don't let the 3 stars fool you. It's good. Really good. Better than most pizzas you'll find in Toronto. But that's also why it only gets 3 stars IMO.

You would expect the crust to be crispy and full of that smoky taste from the wood fired oven, but it's just OK for me. The outside is slightly burnt and center of the pizza is actually kind of soggy.

Everything on the pizza was great, but the crust was very inconsistent throughout. Maybe they were having a bad day, so maybe I'll come back the next time I'm in the area to try it again."}
{"text":"Dough was good, like Indian naan, thin enough you have to fold it. Comes with free bread. Drink was cola but was awful, not real coka cola, some different but inferior brand. Sauce was delicious like fresh tomatoe. Service was fast and efficient and explained everyhing. Pricey though. Waitresses could dress a little better though. Especially if they want a higher tip."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered \"Arugula Salad with Pear, Walnut, Piave, Ontario Gamay Vinaigrette\", and \"Arancini (traditional Italian risotto balls) with Smoked Scamorza, Stracciatella, Tomato, Shallot, Parsley\". Both were delicious! Service was good and fast. I had to charge my phone with them and they didn't mind. It was just very loud during dinner and the area near the front got crammed with people waiting for tables or take-out. so I'd probably return during a less busy hour to enjoy my meal and company more."}
{"text":"Came on Canada day and had an amazing time.

Great friendly service -  came right around when they opened about 11:30am. Got a few apps, eggplant crostini - meatballs - arancini. I don't eat meat but heard the meatballs were great, the arancini was awesome but my personal favorite was the eggplant crostini. So many good flavors going on with the crostini, tastes like they preserve the eggplant in house, such good quality.


Did a classic plain cheese  and mushroom pizza for the mains. Both were very well made and delicious.

Will for sure be coming back, good service and  good food that's worth the price. Very good for Vegetarians. Green P parking lot around the corner as well."}
{"text":"Very busy place, went on a Sunday night and it was completely jammed. Still got a table quickly and we both were impressed with the atmosphere and decor. Drinks came and they were the coldest beers we've ever had. Appetizer was these amazing risotto balls and the pizza was FANTASTIC. Cons- they didn't have tequila. WTF? 
Then I also realized that our waiter never told us the special of the day. Also didn't offer us new side plates for our mains but he did all of that for the table next to us- the aggressively arrogant couple, that looked like they just come out of an appointment with Vidal Sassoon and wearing pretty much a bow-tie short of a tuxedo. Maybe we didn't look suave enough to get the extra touches but according to ourselves we are a pretty dapper
 couple so the jokes on them!  Xoxo The Tequila Couple"}
{"text":"Came here with a work group, so some allowances can be made for the service, but overall I would say we were let down. 

The food was fine, ambiance good and the place looked clean. Two members of our party ordered drinks... And it took about 30 minutes to receive them - that's after several reminders. Pretty poor considering drinks are usually the first thing you get and a restaurant can make lots of money! Once we had eaten no server came to check on us, no one offered more drinks, no one came to clear plates or offer to pack up leftovers. We again waited 30 minutes before the server came to ask about desserts. Then another 15 mins to get a few scoops of gelato. 

Yes, food was good, price was great but the overall service was severely lacking."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Not great. Far too salty.

It's hip and tasty. Needs an upgraded wine list. Prices are a little high for what it is. Not really any alternatives, basically just Pizza.

Fantastic ambiance."}
{"text":"The pizza was good...we ordered the Margarita and the cacciatore pizza. The flavour of the dough was authentic, and the crust was just slightly charred which was perfect. The pizzas are meant to be eaten right away because I find the middle of the pizza did get a little watery. 
I didn't find the chilli oil to be spicy at all, but we asked for chilli flakes instead. 
The service was also very good!  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are really nothing special. I don't understand all the hype about this place. Their gluten-filled dough was super elastic, to say the least. Although I like thin crust pizzas, their pizzas were just not what I expected especially given all the good reviews. It was more like a doughy super thin elastic pizza so salty it gives you the impression that you are full but then 1 hour later, you feel hungry again and I'm not a big eater. Not to mention the service was spotty and slow. I will definitely not return."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Definitely the best pizza place in the city! Recommend the dnuja sausage pizza and the meatballs to share! Yum :) $$"}
{"text":"Not \"pizza\". Tasted more like thin, in places burnt, pita bread. Too much sauce so it was basically soup. No thanks. Won't be back. Also way too crowded and loud. This place is all hype. Go to Marcello's on St. Clair West or Pizza Rustica on Wellington for the real deal when it comes to thin crust pizza that actually tastes like pizza and isn't presented like soupy slop."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat, great ambiance ,  excellent food  , excellent service!!"}
{"text":"We order takeout here regularly but don't go to the restaurant very often because there is usually a wait time involved. 

(Takeout pizza is made preferentially over that ordered by sit-down patrons, so if you call ahead you are in/out in 5 mins). 

The toppings can be a bit of a mixed bag, depending on which pizza you order. I agree with other reviewers that the bottom gets soggy quickly. With takeout, we usually pop it in the oven for a few minutes. That seems to take care of the problem.

The prosciutto pizza is usually very good. 

The only downside is that the dough gets charred/burned and tastes bitter. 

Salad is very good, as per significant other. 

It's a bit pricey for pizza but for the quality it is justified."}
{"text":"We went to this place on a Friday night around 7:30 PM. We had a reservation. When we arrived it was not busy, but by 9 PM it was packed. We got the sausage pizza and Calamari to share between 2 people. The pizza was good, the Calamari was a little too sweet for my taste. 
Overall it is a nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! This was our first visit. We just moved into the area and had been meaning to go for some time. 
We ordered a couple pizzas, but I wasn't a big fan of the Libretto Margarita.
Very comparable to Terroni.
We will be back again, but will probably try the standard margarita pizza instead."}
{"text":"I came here a few months back to celebrate my birthday with my friend- since I absolutely love pizza, but had never been to an 'authentic' pizza restaurant. We came to Libretto on a sunny day, and even though we reserved, there were still many seats open, which was nice! We stuck to the Lunch Prix menu, which is a really good steal for people who like more classic/simple pizza.We both didn't really like the arugula salad, but that had more to do with our own individual tastes rather than the way they made it.

Now the PIZZA, let me tell you, is absolutely amazing! We both went with the Margherita. Upon first bite it was really soft and gooey, but not too much. I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it, but it's so light and airy that it's really easy to devour it! The pizza itself and crust was very toasty and crunchy, but still warm. It was so amazing! I had the scoop of vanilla gelato afterwards which was also delicious and the perfect way to end a meal.

The service is what really gives it all a 5/5- our waiter was really nice and sweet, and didn't mind that we didn't like the salad. He checked up on us, but gave us plenty of time to choose and enjoy our meal, which was great!

I definitely need to come back here as soon as possible! :)"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 for effort, as there was loads of mushrooms and Gorgonzola, although would have liked more cloves of garlic as it was cooked or roasted perfectly to my liking, making me crave for more. However 3 out of 5 on execution of the pizza, as it was a soggy mess as soon as it arrived on my..."}
{"text":"This place deserves its excellent reputation - we've been about 6 times now and have never been disappointed.  Their salads are wonderful - we've tried the beet and buffalo mozzarella, the arugula and pear and the arugula and prosciutto and can't decide on our favorite.  Risotto balls are out of this world.  And the pizza is the best we've had in Toronto - fantastic crust, San Marzano tomato sauce, quality toppings.  Always have excellent attentive service.  Neighborhood gem - just wish it was in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times and wanted to save my review until I found the pizza to end all pizzas.  I might have found it.  

If you go on a busy-eating night of the week -- near weekend and weekend -- you have to wait at least an hour for the table.  That's okay though because there are some great bars across the way to grab a quick aperitif or two before diving in to wonderful pizza.  So, go and give your name and phone number to the hostess and she will call you when your table is ready.

The place is crowded and buzzing and the service is fast!  I recently ordered the duck confit pizza with pear and thought I might have died and gone to pizza heaven.  I didn't even know a pizza heaven existed!

This place is worth the hour wait and worth the few extra bucks you'll have to dish out for a pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza place. We created our own pizza with duck and it was delicious! Also ordered calamari tower for appetizer and lot the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Pizzeria libretto is our go to restaurant when we have a big group and want excellent food. 
The pizza is authentic Neapolitan style and is baked in a stone oven. 
The flavours are amazing, I usually get their feature pizza but also love their duck confit pizza.
I love their wine and cocktail list, I had the white negroni and it was perfect.
Their calamari is so tender and beautifully presented.
Last night I had their dessert and tried the torta - a chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream covered with honey and orange zest. It was delicious but was so filling, I couldn't leave any because it was so good!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have been impressed. 

The decor is very nice. A minimalist, clean feeling with a high ceiling. 

Service is efficient and friendly. 

At my most recent visit, I had the arancini and nduja sausage pizza, and both were excellent."}
{"text":"Having been to the various Pizzeria Librettos, I must say this new King West location is my favourite (and within walking distance to me).

Went for a very late lunch, and the place had only a few occupied tables.  Speaking of tables, I really like that this location is very spacious, esp. with individual tables (not a huge fan of communal seating) and plenty of elbow room.

Three of us ordered our standard faves, and also enjoyed the complimentary house-made focaccia:
-  Flank steak spiedini 
-  Beef Carpaccio
-  Duck confit pizza
-  Prosciutto pizza
-  Special - Hawaiian pizza

I feel that the standard of the food at this Libretto is better than some of the other locations.  I find that this location is more generous with the amount of toppings on their pizzas and the crusts are perfectly charred (but not burned, like I've experienced elsewhere).  Toppings are evenly spread out, whereas I've had some dry spots on my pizzas in the past (from other locations).  We found the Hawaiin pizza a little soggy and hard to eat with hands, esp. since the grilled pineapple pieces were too heavy for the thin soggy crust, so kept falling out.  However, with the use of a fork, it was a taste sensation!

Becuase it was quiet, service was great.  The server consistently made sure everything was as needed, but was not intrusive.

This is I think the 3rd visit to this location since it's opened, and I'm glad to see that standards have not faltered since they've opened here in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"It was during world cup and I was taking an out of towner to the restaurant for a novel Toronto experience. It took forever (1 hour) for them to take orders and they were quite disorganized.
I have visited there a couple of times, not my best experience. Maybe it is simply because the expectation is so high as the name is big."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio for some pizza and had a really good time. It was very noisy because of the street and also extremely windy (nothing you could do though). The pizza tasted great, but cooled off quickly. Service was good once we sat down, but getting a table was somewhat of a process. The hostess was a little scattered. Overall enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"Got a margherita for take out. Phoned ahead and got a polite lady who gave me the exact time to come in and it was ready right when I walked in.  Servers were great and pizza was perfect. Exactly the way I was hoping it would 1t be. Nice soft thin crust and beautiful sauce with a nice sweetness to it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza in Toronto. Libretto offers great ambiance, delicious food and decent wine. The only downside of the place is that it is always crowded, so you sometimes get \"rushed\" service. If you want to share a glass of wine or enjoy a NFL game without being pushed out my the servers, this is not the place. Eat, Pay, and Next."}
{"text":"Im here very often with my boyfriend and the service is unbeatable! Happiest staff ever they know their menu very well and always have great recommendations! Tried the gnocchi for the first time, i always ask the server what they like. I ended up ordering it for a appetizer and ordered 2 more to go. Great environment ! I would recommend this place to everyone !"}
{"text":"My second time to come here with my husband and 11month old baby. It's a Saturday 12noon and there are only a few tables occupied and the restaurant is pretty quiet compared to busy week nights. We ordered the calamari, meatballs and pizza special. We loved all of them but especially the pizza special. It was salami?, sweet red peppers, basil and it was excellent. The meatballs were a little salty but tasty and the calamari was as good as the first time I had it. Service, with the exception of the server not hearing my order for hot tea, was excellent as well. The servers came and said hi to our baby. They got us a high chair and seated us at the back so we can have our stroller with us. They even chased us down to give us back our baby's forgotten cloth book!"}
{"text":"Simply put- the food is consistently delicious and the service is great! Worth the 2 hr drive!"}
{"text":"3.5 for overall food and ambience. I had their Prix fixe lunch menu for $15 which was a good choice and value.
The classic Margherita pizza is top on my list. Chewy and  what you would expect. Confit duck pizza in itself was a  novelty that on the second slice became unpleasant. Calamari was good but not wow. The beet caprese salad was light and fresh. The ending gelato was a bit grainy and icy, could of been better. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"The Libretto vs. Queen Margherita Debate

Pizzeria Libretto - 4.5 stars

Warning: I'm going to go on a sideways and slightly nostalgic bent here so if you want to cut straight to the restaurant review scroll down a few paragraphs until you hit the ***. Also, I promise that not all of my other reviews are this ridiculous. 

Still with me? Good. So pizza is something that is near and dear to my heart. In my final year at university I taught myself how to make various types of dough from scratch after spending way too much time on an online pizza forum that was frequented by both professionals and the type of amateur at-home cooks that spend their hard-earned money and time building wood-burning ovens in their backyards (I one day hope to be lucky enough to fall into the latter category). I literally would make pizzas every other weekend, taking notes and experimenting with slight tweaks in different variables with the ultimate goal of making the best pie (regardless of style) that I could churn out in a conventional home oven. Sadly, the general busy-ness of life has cut into my pizza hobby but I do still make a solid pizza now and again. 

Anyway, the point is, I really like pizza, and I think that I am at least moderately qualified to talk about it. For the longest while however I really felt that our fine city, while great in so many ways , was something of a wasteland for pizza, or at least good, authentically Italian, pizza. 

I tried a lot of random pizza places and nothing made me more upset then the countless restaurants that claimed, falsely, to make 100% Neapolitan pies (I'm looking at you, every single pizza place on College Street) only to serve undercooked, overcheesed pizza that wasn't even hand tossed. I even came across at least one Margherita pizza that had tomato sauce, cheese and wait for it, oregano, as the three primary ingredients, which is all types of wrong.

This all started to change with the advent of Terroni, which was then eclipsed by the two new undisputed pizza champions of Toronto - Pizzeria Libretto and Queen Margherita Pizza.

After getting out to Queen Margherita for the second time about two weeks ago I now feel ready to weigh in.

***

Being a west-ender, I am much more familiar with Libretto, and I try to get one of their pizzas (whether dining in or getting take-out) at least once a month. The pizzas at Libretto are uniformly great and also deliver an authentically Neapolitan experience. I have tried just about everything on the menu, but my regular is a doppio Margherita, which is a Margherita with extra cheese (the regular Margherita is a little under-cheesed). 

Here's the downlow on the Libretto pie: 
Sauce - fresh and full of flavour. As good as it gets.
Cheese - top notch Fiore di Latte
Crust: nicely charred and perfectly chewy. 
Toppings: all very good, although in some cases (ie. prosciutto and arugula) they put too much of them on, while in others (the normal Margherita) they put too few (hence why I always order the doppio)


Queen Margherita on the other hand is a less familiar experience for me. I have only been twice but both times have had great experiences there. I have tried the Margherita (which was textbook) and spicy sopressata (very tasty and very spicy). 

Here's the QM pizza breakdown:
Sauce - equal to that of Libretto (ie. amazing)
Cheese - ditto
Crust: Queen Margherita - it was about as flavourful as it gets and just the right amount of charred. There was simply just a bit too much of it. 
Toppings: perfectly balanced

In terms of other key decision factors I offer the following:

Libretto has slightly better appetizers including solid charcuterie, phenomenal meat balls (only occasionally on the menu) and really good salads. I also have a slightly counterintuitive personal bias towards Libretto's crust, which although arguably ever so slightly inferior to Queen Margherita's from a taste perspective, is more manageable because it isn't so thick. The no reservations policy is obviously a bit of a drag but if you give your cell phone number they will call you 10 minutes before your table is ready so you can go and enjoy one of the many awesome bars on Ossington.

Queen Margherita on the other hand has the added bonus of taking reservations and  ridiculously tasty chili oil. On the downside however I felt that the appetizers fell a little flat (sausage and polenta was a bit salty and osso buco crostini were not as flavourful as expected). 

So my final verdict?

I would give both restaurants a 4.5/5.

Queen Margherita has better pizza (if only slightly), but I think that Pizzeria Libretto remains the superior restaurant if only because the rest of the menu is a bit better. At the end of the day however, both are great, and are about as good as you can get in any other good pizza city. 

Toronto should be proud.

PS - to my New York friends, I like them both better than Motorino."}
{"text":"The pizza was DE-Licious! We ordered the flank steak skewers, the cacciatore salami and the DOP marinara. The skewers and the salami pizza were amazing! The steak was cooked to perfection and it melted in your mouth. The salami pizza had exquisite flavor and was not heavy. The marinara pizza though was just okay. It did not have a lot of flavor and was kind of plain. 

The service on the other hand was not that great. The hostess was kind of mean and there was a 45 min wait that turned into a 55 min wait. Not once did she smile at us. The waitress was a little better, but it was so busy that we had to flag her down when we wanted something. Other than that, the food was great."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Pizzzzzza... and you love the crowed Italian style resturant, with easy going service...  you will love this place... I went there with 7 more guys... sat for 2 hours... eating all kind of pizzas... 

I must admit that the pizza was good, but there is something else in this place... that add some other positive falvour to the pizza... 

it is one of those only places that will still be full of people on 10pm Sunday night...."}
{"text":"So I usually go here every Tuesday for there Lunch Pre Fix menu 15$. 

This excites me , you get the choice of a salad or daily Bruschetta, a choice between pizza or a the daily peadina. For dessert you choose between there gelato or a biscotti. I almost always get the Bruchetta (my favorite one had stretella cheese and prosciutto ) I get the pizza marinara with prosciutto added on, and the vanilla gelato ( I find the chocolate gelato very grainy)

I am always very happy with my meal, however, I am not Completely thrilled with the Pizza. I seem to love everything else they do way more than the pizza, which is why I give them the 4 stars instead of the 5. 

I enjoy a thin crusted pizza, but I hate when the middle of the pizza is soft and sagging. I enjoy a pizza with a decent amount of cheese ,but find they put to little cheese on there pizza.
 I have also had there Sardines pressed in EVOO, they are amazing!

I will continue to go back,however on my last visit the waitress sucked.... the two guys that normally serve me are always awesome! Thanks guys for being so great

OHHHh and they don't take debit........."}
{"text":"If you like saucy pizza, this is where it's at. 

Pizzeria Libretto specializes in Neapolitan pizza. 

Libretto has a great $15 pre-fixe lunch deal from 11:00 am - 3:00 pm. You get a choice of either their Beet Caprese Salad or Arugula Salad as an appetizer. Your main is a choice of Margherita or Marinara pizza. You can also pay a little extra for additional toppings. Dessert is either gelato (1 scoop) or biscotti (3 pieces). 

My favourite pizza here is the Margherita pizza. 

Dinner is also reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a casual dinner especially after work if you work in the financial district. 

Tip: Libretto allows takeout on their $15 pre-fixe lunch deal."}
{"text":"Great Pizzas, our favorite is the Margherita ! This place takes no reservations so it is a hassle to get seated especially on the weekends. Service isn't always great, but the pizzas are worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has spectacular reviews so I was so excited to try it. 

It tastes good, it only takes a minute to make the pizza. We decided on the house made sausage with caramelized onions. 

Pizza was soo thin, like paper thin!!! Very oily, but good 

The dough really tastes like fresh na'an for some reason. 

3.5/5 for food

Service is a bit meh, not the best, nothing amazing. 

3/5

I kept hearing one of the pizza makers cough, and noticed none of them were wearing masks, that really scared me and grossed me out.

It's really expensive for a pizza there, it's $20 for a paper thin medium sized pizza. It's basically a $20 appetizer. Save your money.

Overall, i'm glad i tried it, but i wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday at about 1:30 pm stayed until 4:30pm great place to relax over wine and talk with friends"}
{"text":"I've been several times since my first visit back in 2011, and this place is still phenomenal. I've never had a bad experience! I've always completely loved my meal. The margherita may be my favourite at this point, but it's really impossible to choose.

Finishing with the affogato is the only way to go, though! Recommended."}
{"text":"Food tastes wonderful, good prices and service.  Pizza was a bit too oily and soggy, still tastes great though. Outdoor patio is nice too."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the hype! The service is excellent and the food is great. We had the meat and cheese plate, the steak skewers, and pizza special of the day which was a hot pepper and sausage pizza as well as a margarita pizza and everything was on point."}
{"text":"First time eating at the University location. The space itself is very large with lots of seating. They also take reservations which is nice since the Ossington location does not take reservations.  The food was the same deliciousness as the Ossington location that I normally would go to.  The arancino balls were my absolute fave and the sausage pizza was great, although a bit on the spicy side which I didn't expect.  The calamari was just okay.  The pizza took forever to come out after we had finished our apps. Otherwise no issues with service or food here!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite place in the city.. Gooey, chewy, melt in your mouth pizza . This is the stuff of dreams . Their specials are usually pretty spot on but Napoletana is def my favourite.

The buttermilk calamari is a little too heavy and they never give you quite enough of the sauce that accompanies it. 

Also the spicy oil/balsamic vinaigrette /olive oil mixture they serve with the bread is amazing to dip the pizza crust in."}
{"text":"Stepped in here for lunch and was not disappointed. The service as super-fast and the pizzas were well made. Their Nduja pizza as one of the tastiest Neapolitan pizza I have had in Toronto. They also offer lunch specials which include a salad, a pizza and dessert which is usually a great deal. This place is usually full and reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in toronto, keep in mind you've got at least a 1 hour wait but its worth it!! Staff is great, atmosphere is laid back and cool and the food is to die for. My family and i go once a week we are obsessed, and anyone we ever take to try it always goes back!!! Everything on the menu is great the Danforth location has a brunch pizza with a fried egg that is unreal!"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto from Seattle, and decided to try out this place with supposedly has great pizza. And I must say, it lived up to the hype. I like Neapolitan style pizza; thin under crust with the outside crust fluffy with simple and fresh toppings. Then using a word fired oven just makes it that much better. You cannot customize your pizza, you get what it tells you. All pizzas are 12\", basically a personal sized pizza.

It is a tiny restaurant, can get loud and little cramped when it is busy."}
{"text":"We have  been going here since they opened. We went here last week and like always everything was really good. We ordered an anchovy pizza and mushroom pizza. We were three all of us loved the pizza. We also had a calamari for a starter and it was cooked perfectly well and tasted good. For dessert we had panna cotta which was excellent. Although this location  is far from where we live but it is worth the drive. I think these guys have the best pizza."}
{"text":"My girlfriend gets major props for bringing me to another five-star worthy restaurant!

Got there for about 6:30. We were told it would be 45min to 1 hour wait, so we walked around and got a pint nearby. We got a call from them sooner than we expected! Got seated, greeted and we ate.

Cheese platter was amazing. The cheese themselves were good alone but it's the pairing with respective jams that made it. As for pizzas, we ordered the mushroom and prosciutto & arugula. I was a big fan of the prosiutto and my partner was a fan of the mushroom, so it worked out great for us. And we still had nearly a whole pizza leftover to take home! We left ourselves enough room in our belly for dessert: Tiramisu and espresso cinnamon gelato. I'm glad we ordered these two together because for me the tiramisu was a tad sweet and gelato a tad bitter. Went really well together.

Will definitely come back. With good company, the wait won't seem so long... and it'll be worth it anyway.

Atmosphere - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Food - 4/5
Price - 4/5"}
{"text":"So it appears this place is all the rage. Line ups, Yelpers raving about the quality and authenticity of the Pizza (the ovens are from Naples they say!). 

But here's a question for you - is it authentic for the bottom of the pizza to be wet? Wet dough? And let me throw this out there - it wasn't just me. All diners at my table had the same experience. Our neighbours had the same experience.

So what's the fuss about? Toronto diners are discerning no?

Save your money. Hit up Terroni's - at least they're consistent.

PS the 2 stars are for the toppings (very yummy and flavourful. It's a shame they were rested on a layer of goo) and excellent, friendly service."}
{"text":"For the love of all that is good and holy, have the hot olive appetizer, finish it off with espresso and biscotti, and everything in your middle will love you."}
{"text":"A friend posted up pictures of their meatballs a few weeks ago and I knew I had to go.  I ended up going to the Ossington location with some other friends on a Sunday at 7:30pm.  It was still packed with a 1 hour waiting period.  Their waitlist system is pretty good (ipad w/ reservation system app) as it will text the number you give them.  We headed over to a nearby bar to hang out and build upon our hunger.

I felt the decor took away a bit from the experience with their mix of rustic and modern with new trimmings, plus the lighting was a bit too bright.  One of my friends noted the wine bottles lined up on the walls would have been better replaced with something like canned jars - to which agree.  The racked wines were fine though.  I guess I had in mind a more rustic look, but that isn't what I came for anyways.

We ordered the meatballs and three pizzas.  The meatball appetizer was a hit with the cheesy tomato sauce base and it set our expectations for the pizzas.   As I never had Neapolitan styled pizza it was an interesting experience to taste the thin pizza and moistness of the toppings.  The pizzas' thinness allowed for the taste of the toppings to come through.  Also, we noted that the crust was delicious, with a slight sweetness to it.  I would have to say of the three pizzas we ate the Cremini Mushroom was excellent, my friend's orgasmic reaction said it all."}
{"text":"we ate family style with plates to share, and the food was excellent! duck confit pizza with pears was great (saltiness of the duck was great with the thinly sliced sweet pears on it), the arrancini was wonderfully cooked, and the salad was fresh and tasty.  

The place is loud and busy and friendly.  They don't take reservations, but small groups get seated pretty quickly.

A good place to go for a fun and lively dinner out."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizzas, my favourites are the margaritas, but the mushroom pizza is very good as well.  The fried calimari and the salads are very delectable as well.  I would highly recommend this place in a heart beat, but just so you know, it can be very loud and a bit of a wait, but well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night for dinner and waited 30minutes for a table, we left our number and went down the road to Venezia bakery for a treat before returning.

They serve a pretty good pizza by Toronto standards, it is pretty pricey for a personal size pizza (~ $16-$18 each). Tried the Ontario Prosciutto and Libretto Margherita pizza. Both were pretty tasty, they were very generous with the Prosciutto on the pizza with prosciutto. The pizzas got a bit soggy as you cut into it.

The waiter was nice and friendly but slowwww, he came by us 15 minutes after we were seated and also took a while to get our food. It was not intentional because he was clearly swamped, so I still left him a good tip, but then I was thinking that they might need more staff.  Seating is cramped and it is too loud to have a conversation without screaming a bit.

Overall, I think it is just Ok but definitely a notch above the rest of the pizza places in Toronto, not worth the wait or price in my opinion (maybe I am spoiled with the many great pizza places in NYC)."}
{"text":"The front door is hard to find; they to put a sign on the street. I went there last night with some friends on our way to see Star Wars. The place was pretty busy, but we'd made a reservation and were seated right away.  We had a great server, he was attentive and  prompt but the location they seated us made it difficult to server us.  The place is pretty tight and the servers had to keep squeezing through.  It's not a big deal but a bit annoying when it keeps happening over and over.

We ordered the calamari and fried sausage as appetizers.  Of the two I would say the sausage was better.  I don't like really calamari when someone messed with the tzatziki sauce or tries to make it different.  The sausage however was excellent with goat cheese and sauteed rapini it was a lovely little dish.  A larger plate of that and the foccacia bread and I could be very happy indeed.

Everyone ordered different pizzas but we didn't share.  Not that kind of group.  If it has been with my family we would have been swapping pieces for sure.  I almost recommend that more.  I had the Libretto Margherita which was ok.  Honestly I would give it a 3/3.5 out of 5 it's okay but not spectacular and the whole tomatoes made the pizza soggy.

The saving grace was the tiramisu.  It was lovely. The sabion(sp?) cream was light and thick, with lots of cocoa and rum. The lady fingers were very moist without falling apart.  In fact I would put this tiramisu up against Marcelo's on St.Clair, it's that good."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars, purely based on the taste.

The lineup can be horrible (they will take your cell and call you and you can go to a bar in the area to wait).  Because it's sooo busy, the service can be subpar (understandable),

Some complain of \"burnt\" crust.  It's a flavour choice.  I've never had it badly burned.  Rather it's \"leoparded\", and the slight char accentuates the cheese very well.  They use tasty ingredients, the pies are awesome.

The place can be too loud at times.  That's part of the ambiance.  But if I wanted to eat pizza at a club and not be able to talk to my friends, maybe I would. 

It's too bad that the best pizza I have had in Toronto so far is so inaccessible.  I have heard rumours that  the Danforth location isn't as good.  I hope they can expand to a third location in the vicinity, replicate the flavour,  and ease the congestion."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Salumi e Formaggi, Antipasti, Insalate and pizza.
This is the real deal if you want a delicious wood fired pizza.
Great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Got a table right away on a Tuesday night around 6 pm.  Pizzas took awhile, but was well worth the wait.  Wet in the middle, chewy around the edges, absoutely delicious.  

The waitstaff are soooooo much friendlier at Libretto's than at Terroni's. Less snob, more friends next door kind of feeling.  I feel like at Terroni's you're being judged if you pronounce something wrong on the menu.  Here, it's like a slap on the back, smiles all around.  

I cannot wait to go back to Libretto's.  I'll be eating a pizza, and ordering one to go for a midnight snack!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fucking phenomenal. Best pizza in Toronto, by far, and I'd almost go as far as to say it's the best pizza I've ever had.

Thankfully since they've opened their second location in the East end, the wait time is now nonexistent. I used to wait 1-2 hours for this place (seriously) - and it was worth it every time, even when shivering in the middle of the winter in a bar across the street, sipping pineapple juice.

The wait staff at this place are, 90% of the time, superb. Once after we got called back (they used to take your # and call you when there was an available table), I had to wait for literally 2 minutes to be led to my table. The rest of the night, me and my dinner partner each got free champagne - which amounted to 3 glasses each. I love the waiters here, seriously - friendly, prompt, on the ball, not awkward, not too invasive, and they don't rush you. 

I always make my own pizza here (I'm vegan) and they're always happy to accommodate my weird requests for lots of vegetables and a side plate of plain arugula (no oil, no cheese, no nuthin' - and they have ARUGULA!). I discovered a love of wildcrafted mushrooms at this place. Divine! Another favourite is a cheeseless pizza with red peppers, zucchini, and eggplant. The vegetables are never overcooked, always supple and juicy. Only once has my pizza been cold, and after I ate half of it I was a bit pissed off so they told me they'd be happy to make me a brand new one, free of charge. Great service. 

Lovely ambiance, definitely a dress-up-a-little-bit kind of place. The prices are very reasonable for the service, ambiance, and amazing food, but it's still packed mostly with 30-something career people, which is really not my scene, but it's the kind of place where you won't feel out of place if you're a bit of a ragamuffin artist type (like me, lol). Maybe because of all the framed pictures of graffiti on the walls?

Anyway, honestly - go here, the food is to die for. The one thing I'd change is to introduce a vegan-friendly (and lactose-intolerant friendly) sorbet on the menu, so I could actually get something for dessert. They do have gelatos but they all have cream or egg or something which makes it inedible for me. Come on, Libretto! But I give 'em 5 stars anyway, because they're just that good."}
{"text":"I love to come here for take out and head to a near by friend's place or especially to Trinity to enjoy it picnic style. 

We enjoyed the margherita and nduja typically but I have wandered through the menu - I really don't say no to pizza in general. 

Crust has perfect amount of bubbles and burnt edges in the way I love."}
{"text":"I waited in line before the opening hour because my sister told me there will be a line... well there was. but I don't know why. so we got in and wanted to sit in a booth, but were told that all the booths were reserved (really?!) so we were seated at the tall tables. well, the booths stayed empty until we left.
also, the pizza is really high priced for no reason. it doesn't taste so good. actually, I didn't even finish my pizza because the toppings were terrible. not enough cheese. I don't get that. the prices are high but 4 pieces of cheese on the whole pizza??
service was slow... food was meh... wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I had the Pear & Duck Confit, thin crust pizza. It was pretty bland for my taste but when I piled on the toppings on my last slice, it tasted great! It's a bit on the pricey side at about $20 including tax for one individual pizza but that's the price you pay for the higher quality ingredients and environment."}
{"text":"I'm still confused by the following this place has, how can your mouth actually find this pizza edible? Let alone enjoyable. 

Pizza Libretto was hands down, by far, the most disgusting pizza I've ever eaten. The sauce tastes terrible, the center is soggy, and the dough is just plain bad. I'm a sucker for good pizza and wanted to like this place so badly. But I just couldn't, no matter how hard I tried. 

After waiting over an hour for a table, it was annoying to find out that our cheese plate was the most agreeable tasting part of our evening. I will gladly wait an hour for something that's worth it, Pizza Libretto is absolutely not."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city and they have spelt crust!   Make sure to ask for the chili oil.   It is perfection and the staff is always friendly"}
{"text":"Yes. Everyone is right. You are going to wait. I would say that it is worth it. I think this place sustains a small # of bars in the area solely on the traffic they get from people waiting for a table at Libretto. 

I have tried about half of their pizzas and I would say that the margherita is still my favourite. Simple and classic. The pizza dough is so good. Chewy, delicious. It reminds me of naan. But pizza naan. 

The pear and arugula salad is awesome, and the duck proscuitto is great too, but it is all about the pizza.

Save room for the affogato."}
{"text":"At long last, I made my journey to pizza mecca (as was reputed) and can happily say that I wasn't disappointed. We were able to jump over the wait line because we were with someone who was on the \"in\", so I think I evaded the annoying bit that way.

The appetizers were definitely stand-outs of the meal - beef carpaccio, mozza and tomatoes, tasty slices of bread with fragrant olive oil - all excellent. Needless to say, the pizzas were not to be missed either. It is expected that some comparisons will be drawn between Libretto and Terroni, and I must say that where Terroni fails, Libretto succeeds. Not a burnt/overly crispy crust to be seen - anywhere! Delicious ingredients and topping combinations, and yummy soft, doughy thin-crust pizza.

It is irritating that the place is as noisy and busy as it is, but I guess that comes with the territory when you are up there as one of the reigning champions of pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Pizzeria Libretto for awhile now and was happy that they opened a location within the Financial district. 
Started off with the Rocco's Salad and enjoyed the combination of the fried poached egg and prosciutto. It was a fairly large portion as well so very suitable for sharing. 
The gnocchi Fritti was good, but came warm. The San Marzano tomato sauce it was served with was very good however.
Also ordered the house made sausage pizza which was good and served with the chili oil on the side. It was my first time trying a white pizza and would prefer a pizza with tomato sauce next time around.
The tiramisu and cappuccino to end off the meal were excellent and reason enough to come back."}
{"text":"Wow!! First time here, we ordered the Arugula salad and the Margarita pizza... AMAZING! 
Service, amazing! Environment so nice and music was great too. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Quite simply the best pizza I have had in this city. Simple with high quality ingredients and perfectly cooked in a wood fire oven."}
{"text":"To start, I ordered the quinoa salad because of a review or two here that said it was great. It was honestly horrible. It had ZERO flavour and was a bland salad with a gross mushy texture. I was on a date, so didn't want to make a scene and didn't end up sending it back, but I probably should have. The waitress said nothing when I didn't eat more than a quarter of the salad though. Service was meh throughout.

Pizza was pretty good in terms of taste, but one of the pizzas we ordered was very soggy in the middle, and the other ( a special with a few cheeses some kind of thin meat) was way too salty and we had to pick off half of the meat (thereby losing a ton of the cheese in the process) in order to eat it.

Overall, not that impressed. Would consider giving it another try, but I just don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"This ossington location is usually very busy but it's worth the wait for a table! We usually put our name in then go for a drink at one of the places right beside or in the area. The restaurant will contact you on your cell when your table is ready! The arugula salad could have a touch more flavour but still pretty good! I am a big fan of trying the basic Margherita pizza and this place certainly does not disappoint! It's simple and delicious! The atmosphere here is great! All in all its a wonderful place to go with family, friends or anyone else!"}
{"text":"This place is always a safe bet in terms of service and food. It's become a \"go to\" place when my mom and I are downtown shopping. We always leave happy, which might have to do with their wine list but methinks not. Just love it."}
{"text":"Great pizza... Fresh ingredients. But what is even better than their pizza... is their pistachio gelato!! 

They are very busy... Waited 45min for a table. Is it worth the wait? Not for me....definitely will not be going back in rush hour and definitely have a back up plan."}
{"text":"Get the sharing plate!!! The pizza is fine (nothing crazily different than any other place that serves Neapolitan pizza) and the tiramisu is watery but ohh god the sharing plate. It was exactly what I wanted from a charcuterie board - exciting new flavours but nothing too weird. Ours had duck prosciutto and some sort of dry cured elk along with some fancy cheeses and other accompaniments. I guess that's why I wasn't too wowed by the pizza, the charcuterie board had set the bar so high. Service is great, the decor is shinier and more diner-like than I expected (I thought it would be more rustic and homey- maybe the Ossington location is like that)."}
{"text":"Have been to other locations and had a fantastic experience; unfortunately this location totally missed the mark. Pizza was undercooked - dough was quite raw, and the pizza itself was wet and soggy. Probably just an off day, but nonetheless disappointing."}
{"text":"If Indians made Pizza it would taste a lot like this. Well at least the crust would.
The pizza looked and tasted very much like a fresh piece of Naan. No joke. 
It's a thin, it's soft and not \"well done\" like many of the thin crust pizza shop. For me this is welcomed change as I'm not too fond of them crackers pizzas. 

Pizzeria Libretto has been on my radar for long time. We decided to visit Ossington location to experience where this all started. 

This past Thursday evening (Feb 16/12) it was still busy around 8 with an estimated wait time of 45mins.  We waited close to an hour, passing up the bar seats before being rewarded a private booth. Phew! 

When we sat down we got down to business and ordered a pizza each. :)

1) Cremini Mushroom - Buffalo Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Roasted Garlic, Rosemary, Thyme, Pecorino..... $17

2) House-Made Sausage Caramelized Onion, Mozzarella, Chili Oil..... $16


The pizzas didn't take very long to come. I'd say 6-8 minutes from time of order.

One could eat this pizza with a fork and knife cause its buttery soft but I'd suggest to throw the daintiness out the window and pick this up mother up.

We shared the two pizzas and by the end I was stacking these 2 thin ones on top of each other and eating them in one go. Nom nom. :)


Here's my take on these guys. 

Cremini Mushroom, loved how thin the Cremini mushrooms were, nice aroma, the gorgonzola and pecorino flavours come through with each bite. Creamy and delightful. Great choice!

House-Made Sausage - tasted like an English banger / pork breakfast sausage. Nothing really special actually.  
 
Other comments because the pizza cooks in 90 seconds at 900 degrees Napoleon style certain areas of the crust are burned. So if you believe that charcoal is cancerous: O  I'd cut them out. 


I'd go back, but I'd do takeout next time. The wait for the table isn't worth it unless you are guaranteed a booth.  It's a high likely hood that you're rubbing elbows with someone NYC dining style. The no reservations policy is also a big downer.

Just a quick note on service:  servers were super busy zipping by but we had no problems flagging them down when we needed them, no attitudes whatsoever. The hostesses were also very nice.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Many people feel this is the best pizza in Toronto.  I personally feel that the pizza was MUCH better when it first opened than it is now. At first they seemed to get the combination right for the crust to come out cripsy enough, but my last 4 or 5 visits delivered a charred but rubbery crust. Definitely not something that should come from this special 800 degree imported Italian oven! 

The best pizza they have (IMHO) is the one with proscuitto & arugula. Fabulous fresh & local toppings, and the spiced oil takes it over the top. If only the crust weren't like bubble gum...

So, is it worth waiting for what is often over an hour for this pizza?
Again IMHO, no. But if you're only 2 ppl, and can squeeze in within 30-40 mins (and don't mind grabbing a drink at one of the cool places across the street while you wait for them to text you), then its prob worth a try."}
{"text":"I still think they have amazing pizza.  I went back because my first experience was fantastic!  The second time around it was extremely busy.  I had to wait 1 hour.  When we were finally seated they were trying to rush us out...not as friendly as the first time.  There was literally a couple waiting for our table standing right beside me.  It made me feel uncomfortable. I ended up taking half the pizza home because it was really ackward.  I had the pizza at home and realized that this isnt the type of pizza you can have for take out.  If you dont eat it right away it's soggy."}
{"text":"Amazing house made sausage and caramelized onions pizza - get it with the Buffalo mozzarella."}
{"text":"Not the best customer service received. Our server never asked me if I wanted anything to drink so I settled with the water he kept pouring into my glass. He recommended meatballs to my friend prior to my arrival but when I arrived I clearly mentioned my allergy to dairy and he never asked if I wanted anything else. Strange. I ordered my pizza without cheese which was ok and I had plenty of water to wash it down. We asked for coffee since our waiter clearly had problems in proactively asking for our order. I didn't spend a lot, never had the glass of wine I was looking forward to and I just thought the whole experience was less than stellar."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing. Can't touch that.

The atmosphere left something to be desired. People were sitting so closely that I couldn't hear my girlfriend sitting across from me.

Also the price feels a bit inflated.

I'd probably try elsewhere before I dined in again. But I might do takeout."}
{"text":"Really fantastic pizza! Yeah the line-ups are long but worth it. The Margherita pizza is fantastic. Really simple, completely delicious. And there's nothing better than finishing off with the chocolate affogato. Yummy ice cream and rich espresso - what could be better? Staff is great too, especially considering they are often managing a long line-up of hungry people. Great place all around."}
{"text":"We opted for the fixed price menu $25 gets you a pizza, dessert, salad and app. It is one of the best values around!

Food is excellent. Pizza was paper thin and was well baked. Had a lot of toppings and good flavor, the bruschetta was chick pea I believe, it was passable though not great. The salad was very good and the dessert was good. The atmosphere of the place is full of hustle and bustle. It is always busy so securing a table is not always easy to do.

An issue I have with this place is that we put our names down for a table for two at 7:45 and told it would be about 45 minutes. Fine no problem, we'll stroll around for a bit till we get the phone call. One hour later, no phone call! We walk back in to a half full restaurant and are none to pleased that we never got a phone call. That is inexcusable! Thankfully the food was good and made up for that miserable introduction."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that chewy, slightly burnt, thin-crust pizza could taste so good?

I've been to Libretto twice now, and loved it both times.  I didn't have to wait for a table either time.  Granted, I was in a party of two both times, and I arrived at 5:45 one night (Saturday) and 11:30 on the other night (Friday).

Food and service were both very good, especially the eggplant pizza.  I've read other reviewers complaints about value, but I found that the pizzas are large enough to share, especially if you have an appetizer or dessert.

Two points of interest:

1) They give you a postcard with your bill, which I promptly sent to my friend in Calgary to brag about how much better Libretto's Napolitano pizza is than Pulchinella's.  Don't worry, Alberta already hates Toronto, so there's no risk in gloating that our trendy pizza is better than their trendy pizza.

2) I can't seem to figure out why this place is called \"Libretto\".  Any thoughts?"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I am never disappointed! From the food to the service, this place is always outstanding. You can't find better pizza anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing service experience at Libretto - not only is the food fabulous, The team is too!  Thanks Dan  for the special treat - you made my day !"}
{"text":"I had been hearing good things about Pizzeria Libretto, so it was near the top of my restaurant bucket list for a while. I finally got a chance to eat there on Family Day (with my family of course). I was expecting to see a lot of families there just because of the holiday, but there were a lot of young, urbanite couples. Since the restaurant doesn't take reservations, I'm assuming they all live in the area. The restaurant is narrow, but from where we were sitting (near the front) it looked like it extended pretty far down. I loved the decor, especially the lights on top of the bar.

The restaurant was busy, but I wasn't surprised since I heard it can get pretty crowded just about any day of the week, let alone a holiday. The hostess told us it would be 1.5 hour wait, but it turned out to be only a half an hour wait, and that's probably because the service is so quick. We got our drinks, appetizers, and main courses at a great pace. 

We shared the Crispy Baccala, which were cod cakes. A tad bit on the salty side, but still enjoyable. I ordered the Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula pizza, my dad ordered the Grilled Eggplant pizza, and my mom ordered the Marinara D.O.P., which was a cheeseless pizza perfect for her lactose intolerant needs. The pizzas are huge by the way. Thin, but huge. I think I managed to eat a little less than half of mine. We ended up taking a few slices of our pizzas home. Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert, but I'm hoping to go back soon to get a taste of their desserts. 

The only thing I would like to see from Pizza Libretto are better sliced pizzas. It was hard taking the slices apart because it wasn't fully cut through, but that's just a minor detail and it wouldn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"A Meh tonight.  Normally higher.  Go here frequently.  The pizza is typically very nice.  Tonight it was, in fact, splendid.  Really tasty.  They supplied me a bottle of peppered oil.  I asked for grated Parmesan.  \"We have Grano,\" they said.  Up came a little dish with a spoon, and on the bill, a charge.  Now wait folks:  you do not charge for cheese at a pizzeria.  This is just one more utterly obnoxious example---yes, UTTERLY . . . OBNOXIOUS---of Toronto restaurants that don't have enough confidence to stand behind themselves, trying very hard to seem important and pretentious with little chippies like this one.  To the owner:  You don't need the dollar-fifty.  Why insult me by charging it.  And don't have your manager instructing me on how this is high-quality cheese.  OF COURSE IT IS.  So is everything you purvey.  This kind of thing is nothing but an insult, and for no reason at all, since the food sells itself, your staff are friendly, things are good.  But suddenly, a tiny weeny itsy-bitsy little kick in the customer's head.  Next time you'll charge me for my glass of water, or for using one of your forks?"}
{"text":"Had two pizza there, the spicy Italian sausage and prosciutto one. Love love love their thin crusted pizza base with the perfect amount of chew. The Italian sausage pizza was especially outstanding with the perfect spicy kick. The prosciutto pizza was a prefect example of 'simple good ingredients done well'. Both so delicious! Will definitely be back, maybe later this week."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun and casual. We enjoyed pizza with house-made sausage and a caprese salad. Both were delicious and filling enough to split between two people. Their dinner special was fantastic which was $25 for 4 courses and a bottle of wine for $35. The service was also great, friendly and attentive. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is nicely decorated it it has a very homey feel. I was very disappointed with the pizza. I read many reviews and I was hoping they would be wrong instead the pizza that I got was burnt and soggy. Terroni still has the best pizza in Toronto even if it doesnt have the Verace Pizza Napoletana Association stamp of approval! I would come back for drinks and/maybe dessert but definitely not for pizza!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza in Toronto, came one night on the late side after touring Toronto. Pizza was tasty, but a little too soggy in the middle. Ingredients tasted very fresh though and the flavor was great. Love the laid back atmosphere too"}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver, which has a great pizza scene and saw the reviews so wasn't sure what to expect. I ordered the eggplant pizza and my coworker the pepperoni, both were excellent. The crust was puffy and fhe cenfre chewy, mine had tomato sauce and was fairly wet but the center stayed chewy. Lookong forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:45pm, 25 minutes prior to closing, and received the warmest welcome and the most delicious fresh pizza within 15 minutes. Look forward to returning and eating in; the outdoor space is lovely. Five stars for service and taste (margherita and funghi pizzas)."}
{"text":"Years later this pizza still holds up as probably the best in the city. The 3 course $15 lunch special is unbeatable and the pizza makes you happy when you eat it. Happy!"}
{"text":"love the pizza. love the amazing chewi and right balance of slightly burned dough (AUTHENTIC). great appetizers. must have the Tiramisu. and Derek the server Rocks!   u have to account for up to an hour wait... go to any one of the bars across the street and u will get a call when ur seats are available. great job and very good consistancy from day one which is very hard to do in this business."}
{"text":"Stopped in and was quickly seated at the bar. 

Beautiful marble, great lighting, busy but not loud. 

The service was very good, better than most other places I have been in Toronto. 

Had the meatball appetizer, it was killer! Great choice. The pizza was above average, but now that I know they make a good meatball that's what I will be coming back to! 

Quick, easy, quality food served by talented staff at a reasonable price. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with two friends. The place was packed and had a great atmosphere. The pizza was the best I have had in Toronto yet, though a bit on the expensive side. 

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I heard a new location had just opened downtown and I've been meaning to try it for a while.
This location is huge compared to the Ossington one.
When I arrived there was plenty of tables available, We were sat at a high top for 2.
Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.
We started things off with the fried calamary whitch was dellcioso. Next we each had our personal pizzas I went for the anchovy & buffala mozzarella  pIzza as I was feeling adventurous =) no regrets here.
Everything was quite good I just wish the atmosphere was a bit more  'hip\" like in their other locations. It almost seems like this location is focussed on tourist and bussiness men."}
{"text":"I've been to Librettos on University and Ossington. Both times I'm disappointed by how soggy the pizza is. The crust is perfect, but it just has too much sauce. It's the kind of pizza that will taste good after spending a night in a fridge. I love the Arugula Salad, Meatballs, and the other small plates appetizers. Desserts are standard italian dolci. I'm not sure that I want to pay $15+ for a soggy pizza 3 times, so I don't think that I'm coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"The wait is at least 45 minutes. There are no reservations. 

The pizza is good. though the first time I went there for lunch we had to send back our pizza for being burnt. Therefore there might be a consistency issue here. 

I had the Ontario Prosciutto - it was good, though the cover the entire thing with prosciutto and the salt and the texture from the prosciutto makes it hard to enjoy the flavors of the pizza and to slice it. 

We also had the special - sausage with maple syrup - it was good. Not bad. Spicy though. 

The pizzas are a normal size. I would get my own. 

It would be a 4 but I think it's overpriced...."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere. 
Especially, I loved the mushrooms pizza...yum. 
Amazing topping.
Try coffee? gelato with espresso. That was quite tasty too.

So, I would like to give 4 stars for this place.
Unfortunately, tiramisu was a bit too creamy for me.
To be honest, i feel that it may be pricey in the end. 
Just because I have been to Napoli, Italy and tried their authentic pizza...
I would come back this place for sure but this is not the best pizza I have ever had in GTA."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto from NYC and I couldn't help but travel miles to eat this pizza multiple times during my trip. The pizza is amazing, the ingredients are fresh and the service is great. 
The pizza is a thin crust and took about 10 minutes to make. The pizza has been good every time. Toppings have been generous as well. 1/3 times I did have to wait and there is no designated waiting area. The wait wasn't significant (maybe 10 minutes) but worth it. 
The setting is right for casual, dinner date, business casual. I was quite comfortable. I can only vouch for the pizza but I was very well pleased with my experience"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends on a Tuesday evening. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were very attentive to your table needs such as refilling your water glasses and taking empty plates away promptly. 

The table came with free bread and oils to dip which was lovely. However, some of my friends were not into chili/hot foods and the oil dip had chili oil mixed into it. 
We ordered the Margherita pizza, the special which was a Lemon Fennel Sausage pizza with rapini and spices, and the Ricotta Gnocci Fritti. The Margherita was what you expect, similar everywhere. The Lemon Fennel Sausage was quite flavourful but the rapini made it a little bitter. The Ricotta Gnocci was ok. I felt the gnocci balls were too dry, but the tomato nduja sauce it came with made up for that. Both the pizzas were thin crusted with a light floppy dough. They didnt skimp on the toppings which was great.  Everything was served quickly because of their marketed \"baked in less than 90 seconds\" pizzas. 

I would have given them 4 stars if not for the paying of the bill. We didnt have cash so when we paid credit, we realised that there is no less than a 17% option to tip. I did not know that you can change the tip percentage manually until my friend showed me (literally punch % you want instead of whats already there). So unless you are an experienced person handling eftpos machines, they try to make you give more gratuities. Im not saying their services wasnt good, however to not give you the option to begin with and make you pay a higher gratuity is quite sneaky to me."}
{"text":"I needed a quick pizza fix after an encounter with a substandard pizza recently. So I yelped around until I found this pizza joint. Awsome interior design, awsome service, and top notch pizza. I decided to try something new and ordered a pizza? with a name I can't pronounce. it was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"it will always be my goto for pizzas.

Great services, amazing food, and love their patio.  Their quality of food is always consistence and they have never disappointed me in anyway. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, wine, atmosphere, and service. Their text system for people waiting for a table works well."}
{"text":"Was un-pleasantly surprised by the lack of \"magic\" in my meal tonight. 
Pizza wasn't flavourful, toppings were scattered thoughtlessly, and the ratio of crust to topping section was horrid. Essentially I ate crust with the tip dipped in cheese and meat. 

If you know me, you'll know I'm (usually) Libretto's number 1 fan. But this has been my 3rd or 4th less-than-stellar experience at the University Ave location. Each time I've become less and less enamoured with the food, but the service is still great! 

If you want Libretto at it's best, I'd still recommend the Ossington location."}
{"text":"This place is my religion.

Like the Phoenix, a bite of their delicious pizza will have you rising from the proverbial ashes. One bite! and you'll have the goddamn spiritual/emotional awakening you've wasted decades watching Oprah for.

I've tried every pizza on their menu, from the ever-classic Margherita to the red-hot Nduja Sausage. I'm equally well-versed in their Appetizers & Desserts. So, coming from a true believer, I'll give it to you straight.

CIBUM:
The House-Made Sausage pizza was arguably constructed by The Big Man himself. It's the unique combination of gooey mozza cheese, caramelized onions, sausage and chilli oil- all melting angelically on top of Libretto's died-and-gone-to-Heaven crust.

My recommendation: preface with the Rocco's Salad or Beef Carpaccio and finish things off with the tiramisu. 

POPULO:
The staff know the true meaning of hospitality. They are the warmest people you'll find in this industry. The best part for me is seeing and tasting the passion they have for their menu, it's baked right into every bite, present from the moment you walk in the door.

AERIS:
The atmosphere is usually quite loud. Don't plan on a quiet or romantic evening when you come here. You'll be seated with elbows nearly touching the man or woman to your left.

CONCLUSIO:
If you are looking for divine intervention, look no further. The menu is decadent, even sinful, but without the side dish of Catholic Guilt you might have elsewhere. 

This is the way food ought to be made. Amen."}

Extra information:

*Closed for Lunch on Sundays
*Famous for authentic, Italian pizza

Everyone in Toronto knows about the famous Pizzeria Libretto. I found out when I started doing some readings up on popular restaurants within Toronto. I never knew it was so far (from where I live)! I passed by Pizzeria Libretto on my way to fishbar and since I made it all the way there, I couldn't pass up the chance to try this place. So my friends and I decided to drop by for pizza after happy hour at the fishbar which was just next door.

When we arrived around 6, it was already picking up and the tables were full. Fortunately, we got a table right away when we walked in but I wouldn't be surprised if we got the last table that was avail- because the moment after we sat down, the line started forming near the entrance and it was getting long.

They gave us complimentary bread with balsamic vinegar + chili oil dip. Bread was cold but it was fresh and it went really well with the dip. After half a piece of bread, I had to stop myself to save room for Pizza because I was already half full from my oysters from Fishbar.

Ordered: Cremini Mushroom Pizza 5/5

* Real Neapolitan Pizza made with Buffalo Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Roasted Garlic, Rosemary, Pecorino and Thyme for $17
* Pizza is huge (enough for 2 people) with thin dough
* They do not hold back on mushroom and garlic
* Despite the dough being thin, it's very chewy with a nice texture
* Flavors of the toppings are not very strong, overall soft and subtle flavor
* Toppings do not overwhelm the bread and there is a nice balance between the two
* Delicious on it's own but I loved it with the chili oil they gave us on the side
* I thought it was interesting how they give you the chili oil (something different)
* It's not spicy and it tastes like chili olive oil (rich chili taste without the heat)


Ordered: Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula 3/5

* Real Neapolitan Pizza made with Garlic, Tomato, Oregano, Shaved Grana Padano for $16
* I've made something like this at home before
* Basically like salad on a pizza
* Refreshing and lighter pizza from their menu
* Strong arugula scent/taste
* Bitter arugula and the salty prosciutto compliments each other with the aftertaste of nutty parmesan cheese


Ordered: Libretto Tiramisu 4/5

* Individual tiramisu for $7
* Served in a jam-glass type of container
* This was so delicious!!
* There is more cream than the bread(lady finger)
* Strong coffee taste
* Very sweet and rich
* Felt more like a mousse which I love

Summary: Many restaurants don't live up to the hype for me, but Pizzeria Libretto did not disappoint. It is actually the closest thing to what I had in Italy and it is damn delicious. Next time, I am dropping by when I am starving- would like to try their calamari, Salumi Board and the duck pizza!"}
{"text":"OK listen up gluten-free peeps! This is by far the best place to find AMAZING gluten-free pizza! I have had my share of gluten free pizzas of which I couldn't even finish one slice. Definitely a must try.
Aaaaand go!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I tend to go during the day since it tends to be a bit less busy. On weekdays from 11-5 they have a kick ass prix fixe. A salad, pizza, dessert - how can you go wrong. I always get the prosciutto pizza on spelt! It's consistently amazing. The seating in the back is very close together, sometimes it can feel like you are having a conversation with the table beside you."}
{"text":"First went here on a date. We waited an hour and a half to be seated (they didn't take reservations) which made us a little irritated but once we took a bite into our pizza's all was forgiven. 
They make amazing food and I could never go anywhere else for pizza!"}
{"text":"One of my fave pizza spots
gets busy-only once has it been lacklustre-generally great"}
{"text":"It's....real.

Real pizza...in Toronto.

Really.

I...review...food...good...now

Oh sorry for the rampant synaptic misfires - my brain had difficulty in processing the fact that my mouth had just ingested REAL PIZZA IN TORONTO.

Libretto makes proper Italian pizza (NEW YORKERS - HEED MY WARNING - NOT THE PIZZA YOU'RE USED TO) in the true Neapolitan tradition.  These crispy, light discs of perfection are swathed in a sweet juicy tomato sauce, genuine Fiore Di Latte mozzarella, and a selection of toppings delivered fresh daily directly from Mount Olympus.

After recovering from the shock of the amazing pizza, I returned to sample some of the other fare and was similarly impressed.  Honestly, every single item I've consumed at Libretto has been superb.

The 3 course lunch set has now been sampled several times...no, not enough to have had EVERY potential combination, but certainly a sufficient reference sample to prove my hypothesis of absolute deliciousness.  

The lunchtime service was great and it was nice to see the space with, well, some space.  Dinner can be pretty crowded - but that really just adds to the atmosphere.  Ignore any of the whiners and haters - this is the real deal, it's right here, so get going!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are the best I've had in Toronto. QMP comes close---Terroni is way distant, but still totally delicious as all pizzas are. 

The hate needs to stop. The crust is like the crust in Naples. It is not like the \"thin crust\" pizza my grandfather talks about. (N.B. my grandfather is from Bermuda where the pizza is possibly the world's worst--imagine saltines with a can of cheesefood dumped on them--the thin crust he's referring to is probably something he imagined). Soggy/soupy is no complaint about this style of pizza---though I still like mine a little more sturdy than an actual soup. 

It isn't Milwaukee thin-crust either. It's neapolitan. Y'all need to relax. 

Tell me about the ingredients: Do the eggplant pop? Do the salame sizzle? Is the cheese got du guu and the special cream too? Yeah? Then be quiet and let this place shine. 

This is the kind of pizza they line up for in NYC. Don't even pretend that isn't important. 

The appetizers don't really appeal to me---but the arugula salad is spicy and nicely dressed. The meats aren't amazing...but they're pretty good. I always like the bruschetta toppings, and they've had some nice bufala ricotta in the past. The wine list could be a little friendlier to my wallet...but these are all minor complaints. Most people seem to get the pizza, why waste my time on \"thin crust\" obsessives like my grandfather (may he rest in peace) who wouldn't."}
{"text":"Thursday arrivals at 8:30 make for 45 minute waits but let me tell you, once you step through those doors, you're not leaving. The smells, seeing gorgeous plates of food leaving the kitchen- nah, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. You have the option to leave, grab a drink around Little Portugal and they'll call you when the time comes. Nice to have options but we stuck around. 

It can get a little steamy with a table so close to the wood fired oven, but it's worth it for the view. Our server was sweet and understands the urgency of our hunger after the wait, taking our drink and meal orders at the same time. I had a glass of Riesling, loved the stemless wine glasses. Don't really understand how they keep track of everyone's wine choice but they knew exactly where to put each identical glass. 

I ordered the grilled eggplant pizza that comes with chilli, basil and ricotta salata.  They made them so quickly, we got the first of our pizzas right before the waiter came around with the bread! But I was the last one to get my pizza, so I was grateful for the bread. It had a great bite to it and a nice accompaniment dipper of chilli oil.  

My pizza arrives a few minutes after everyone else's and I can't wait to dig in. And I don't have to! After seeing my friends' melty mozzarella, I get a bit of cheese envy. But pay no mind to that, there are TONS of factors that make up for it. Such as an amazing fire burnt, toothsome crust, a good tomato sauce, a zip of spice and thinly sliced eggplant. This might be sacrilegious with such fine pizza, but I enjoyed rolling up small sections and eating it that way. 

We were almost tempted by dessert but made it out of there safely. The panna cotta sounds delicious. I'll definitely save room for next time. There will be a next time! It was a night of some great service, food and company."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming about the calamari since I had it several weeks ago. It's served with a fantastic romesco sauce with basil oil. The asparagus and whipped ricotta salad is very light and tasty. I had the special, a marinara pizza with ricotta and it was definitely the best pizza I've had in my entire life. The portion is fairly large to begin with, especially if you add on appetizers, so I had half my pizza the next day. Obviously not as good as fresh, but it still was very very delicious. And the bread that comes before the meal is perfect: fresh, warm and tasty."}
{"text":"This place has the best gluten free pizza hands down I've ever had ANYWHERE in my life. You'd ever know it wasn't a regular pizza. Beautiful dough base and delicious generous toppings! Can't say enough good things :) plus our server was super sweet and helpful with the menu. This spot is celiac friendly and the staff are very knowledgable about keeping things gluten free."}
{"text":"The ambience of eating dinner on the patio during a hot evening in August is pretty divine.

The food was OK. The crust of the mushroom pizza was a bit soggy and the dressing of the kale salad had far too much lemon juice in it. Eating the salad on its own was inedible due to its tartness. We resorted to eating the salad with forkfuls of pizza so that the flavours were balanced (and which ended up tasting surprisingly good). 

The panna cotta was pretty average. Unfortunately, they were out of the bombolone (Italian doughnuts) that day. 

Sharing a pizza, salad, and dessert between two people worked out to $45 with tax and tip included."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here with high expectations. Lunch was packed and tables were already full by 11:40am (they open at 11:30). According to the staff they usually have a line before doors open on Thursdays and Fridays. Bar seating was plentiful and staff were very very nice. We both ordered the lunch special which gives you salad, marg or marinara pizza, and dessert for $16. You can sub any other pizza for an additional $5. 

Pizza's were huge and crust was good chewy. The center was soft, which we were told was to be expected. But it was just a bit too soft for my liking, almost soggy with everything falling off. I prefer my pizza to have a bit more crunch.  My friend had half her pizza left over and I had a quarter left, which meant good value, but pretty annoying since we were told they were single sized and now we have to walk around with pizza boxes (first world problems). Anyway, would have been awesome if they had a sharing options for people who didn't want to waste food or be complete fatties.

I probably wouldn't recommend to anyone, but also wouldn't say no to this place if someone suggested."}
{"text":"You guys, I am hooked on their white duck pizza and I can't even lie. I am upping my rating to 5*s because for all of the naysayers (I'm guessing there are a bunch based off the 3.5 rating) this place has consistently been able to:
- fit me in, without reservations
- have excellent service
- deliver time and time again on that white duck pizza.

Delicious, fast, and a great location."}
{"text":"Third visit with a group of friends and had consistently great service. Made a reservation for 3 on a Friday night and was seated upon entering. Walking in without a reservation is not recommended.

Visited with a friend who is vegetarian and doesn't eat cheese that contains rennet (found in the majority of cheeses). Asked our server whether she could ask the chef if their cheeses contained this ingredient- they do. The server was very helpful offering modifications to the menu and went through the dish deconstructing each ingredient ensuring the dish was acceptable to her dietary needs. In the end, the server then asked the table if she should be aware of any other allergies at the table- nice touch! 

User friendly menu highlights the vegetarian dishes- quite extensive.

Starters:
Meatballs- classic. housemade. friend throughly enjoyed this
Black and White Quinoa Salad- not what I expected based on traditional quinoa dishes- DELICIOUS! Light, airy, and crunchy with bold flavours. The almond dressing I would liken to a creme fraiche. I typically don't order salads but this one was worth every penny! 

Buttermilk Calamari- crunchy with a perfect texture. Dish presented in a bed of romesco sauce. Order this.

Mains:
Grilled Eggplant pizza
Nduja Sausage- by far the hit with everyone I've taken to Libretto
Margherita D.O.P- on the cheesier side

Great service and consistency!"}
{"text":"Food: 7.5/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 7.5/10

Although my scores would indicate that I would give a 3/5 stars, I am giving this pizzeria 2/5 because I really expected better. And while it is unfair to blame an establishment for the reputation that precedes it, potentially furthered by great Yelp reviews, I do and rightly so. 

My date and I shared the calamari to start. I liked that it came with a red pepper sauce, something different for a deep-fried plate, but in the end, that's really all it was. A deep-fried plate with red pepper sauce. 

We each had a pizza - 1 cremini mushroom (with your good rosemary, thyme, mozzarella, etc) and 1 that I don't remember the name of. It was a meat pizza and had basil in it (insert more generic Italian language here). 

The pizza was hot - a plus. But honestly, I was disappointed. The flavours seemed to falter - I kept on adding chili flakes to mine in hopes of giving it some punch, and the thrill of discovering a great pizza joint slowly wilted in my mouth and my head. 

The bottom line: the food ain't bad, but it will not be your go-to pizza joint for sure."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Libretto and we came by for lunch to avoid the massive wait times during dinner.

We were sat immediately and the place was half full.  5 minutes went by and I looked up and realized a line had already formed.

We ordered a homemade pepperoni pizza and nduja sausage pizza.  We had an oxtail gnochi to start as well.

The gnochi was excellent.  It had some great flavours and I really enjoyed it.  The pizzas arrived shortly and they were just as I remember, really good.  Both the pizzas were spicy and each pizza tasted like they had their own style pizza sauce.  The crust is the only thing I don't love about Libretto.  It's good but I've had a lot of great thin crust pizzas the last while and this one doesn't match up.  It's ok but not great.

TIP: If Libretto is packed, you want pizza and don't want to wait you might want to check out Piola on Queen St.  The pizza is very comparable in terms of quality, quantity and price minus the wait."}
{"text":"There's one word that comes to mind when I think of Pizza Libretto: drool. It's just that good. I would eat here every day if I could, but it would inevitably lead to me strutting around Toronto with an unattractive pizza belly. (At least I'd be happy!)

This place is always bustling and expect to wait at least 45 minutes or an hour if you arrive during prime time dinner service. Luckily, the hostess is always very friendly and accommodating. She will take down your number and call you when your table is ready. Very convenient considering there are a few little spots in the vicinity where you can have a beverage and a quick chat while you wait and dream about the pizza you are about to happily consume. 

Libretto's pizza is delicious for a variety of reasons. The ingredients are fresh, natural, and simple. They are also local - I always offer an imaginary hi-five to businesses that support the little people. The pizza dough is a little bit crispy, a little bit soft and can withstand whatever toppings you are craving. I often go for the margarita pizza. The mozzarella is fresh and the basil is a nice finishing touch on your palate. The pizzas also cook in less than 90 seconds in the wood burning oven, so once you've ordered, it won't be long before your eyes widen and you do a lil jig in your seat. Sheer happiness is about to ensue.

I often get takeout from Libretto (to avoid the throngs of people), and while it's not as hot once you open the box, it's as equally tasty as when dining in the restaurant. Let me put it this way. I often go with a friend who inhales the pizza minutes after she's cracked the box open. If that doesn't exemplify how scrumptious the pizza is, I don't know what does.

Libretto is the bee's knees and the cat's pajamas. You will not find better pizza in Toronto...I'm sorry, you'll just have to go to Italy to match its taste and we both know that will get pricey."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price. Not a regular corner pizza shop. The place filled up pretty quick for a Thursday."}
{"text":"Great pizza! One of my favourite locations for good pizza in Toronto. Price range for 1 pizza is anywhere from $14-20 I believe, but worth it. 1 pizza per person is quite filling too! Also great for ordering multiple options with a group and sharing. Personally love their eggplant pizza! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Craving some really good, authentic pizza, my date and I headed to Pizza Libretto. I had heard everyone raving about the pizza, we checked it out to see what the hype was about. 

The unfortunate part of Pizza Libretto is that they do not accept reservations, unlike their sister restaurant, Enoteca Sociale so I figured that on Tuesday night they would not be packed - I was wrong. When I arrived, there was about a 20 minute wait for a table but no wait for a seat at the bar. We took the bar seating - it actually worked out, we shared a communal area with other patrons. 

Drinks 

We ordered half a litre of Ripasso 2009 DOC, Monte Zovo, Veneto - it was a wonderful medium bodied red. After finishing the first half a litre, we ordered another half a litre. We should have ordered the bottle, we would have saved a few bucks! Hindsight is 20/20, oh well. 

Food 

Appetizer 

Buttermilk Calamari, Romesco (a red pepper almond sauce) - OMG - so good, the sauce was wonderful. If there weren't people around us, I would have licked the plate. 

We ordered two pizzas - one tomato and one cheese: 

Margherita D.O.P - simple, clean, DELICIOUS! I loved the thin crust, perfect ratio to cheese to sauce. My favourite and my date's as well. 

Verdura - in comparison to the Margherita, this was an ok pizza. The rapini was a bit bitter but was balanced with the black olives. I really liked the goat cheese. 

Service 

Fabulous - we had a great waitress who met our dining needs. She was attentive as were the other wait staff. Food was brought out quickly and plates were cleared once we were done. 

Atmosphere 

It felt like we were in a pizza shack, cozy but loud. Very different vibe to Enoteca Sociale which has a more romantic vibe. 

To date on my Toronto pizza experience, Pizza Libretto is a clear winner. I will be back in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is the incredible.
When it comes to Napoletana Pizza (outside of Italy). This place is as good as it gets!
Perfectly cooked crust, plentiful toppings and fast service. Bridget was our waitress and she is the class of the joint when it comes service. The others we've have had dont seem to be as on their game as Bridget.

If I had to be really picky.... The tables in the back middle of the resturant are to close together for my liking. Try and get a table against a wall or one of the 3 booths near the bar.

For the perfect experience at Libretto follow instructions below:

- request a booth or table against wall. if not available...wait!
- ask for Bridget to be your waitress
- Order a Pizza, any Pizza!
-Order a Cappuccino because they are done perfectly!
- Order desert because they are all great.
Thanks,
Enjoy Life!"}
{"text":"Came here on Monday night and I understand the rave! 

The pizza is really good, our table had the Margherita, Diavola and the Nduja. The Margherita and Diavola were liked the most, Diavola has lots of toppings and a good amount of spice.

Service was good - a bit slow at times. Took a while for them to come by and we did have to ask if they gave table bread, (we were hungry and waiting for one person to join us) which I feel is something the server should be the one to bring up first.  But she was super friendly so it kind of made up for it.

The only complaint we really had was with the Tiramisu - It seemed to be super saturated and soggy - was not bad, but did expect better.

Overall good experience and would definitely be back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"My number one favourite pizza place in the Queen west area! 

I just can't get enough of their duck confit white pizza with a glass of Pinot noir! Yummy! Also the beef carpaccio is just a must! Try it with arugula for a full experience!

The ambiance is also very smooth and I can bring my one month old baby who's enjoying the white noise :)

The only con is that I have to keep myself from going every single week!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner right after work at about 6pm and dined at the patio. The patio is ideal in maximizing sunlight, breeze as well as city view, we were also seated right away. I've frequented this pizza place several times and the food never disappoints. 

On this occasion we ordered the octopus carpaccio as an appetizer and the featured tomato pizza. The pizzas are thin crust and baked in a brick oven giving it a awesome texture, this occasion was no different. The tomato pizza had four types of tomatoes and despite that it was not soggy at all. The octopus carpaccio was very refreshing, the octopus was cut thinly and seasoned with lemon as well as mint with a potato chip to top it off. 

When we come we usually get the buttermilk fried calamari which is highly recommended. The calamari is usually crispy and seasoned really well."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I highly recommend the calamari and the duck confit pizza.  The margherita pizza is also amazing considering how simple it is. The service is quite good. 

What I don't like:

1. They don't serve coke but instead have some weird cola that tastes awful (and is also caffeine free).

2. The portion size of Rocco's salad has been getting smaller and smaller. I love that salad. It used to be large enough for 2 people to share. It is now too small for one person to have (and thus no longer worth the price, in my opinion)."}
{"text":"\"All pizza is good pizza, not all pizza is certified pizza\", this is according to executive chef Rocco Agostino. I agree with Chef Agostino, except I have to add to his assessment: not all pizza is Pizza Libretto pizza. We've had meals in Italy, the south of France, Spain, and the pizza here is just as good, if not better because of how it's made and the creations that are developed here with local produce, locally-sourced. 

The staff here are fantastic - patient, willing to educate and share in the culinary experience without being overly present at the table. 

Pizza Libretto is definitely a must to visit if you're in the area. Reservations are not taken, but the park is nearby and very pleasant to walk through until they call your mobile to let you know a table is ready. 

Be sure to leave room for dessert - the gelato is excellent, and the espresso is a perfect compliment after a good meal."}
{"text":"Crust was very soggy in the center and overall unimpressed with quality. Service was very good but pizza was not. Meatballs for appetizer were good. I've been to several authentic Neapolitan pizza restaurants that do an amazing job. Last one was in Worcester MA called Volturnos and the pizza chefs pay close attention to making sure the crust stays at the right consistency 
Hopefully they will get better at preparing the pizza"}
{"text":"Great experience and delicious thin crust pizzas. Duck confit is to die for. Expect long wait times though it's not as bad as they call your cellphone so you can go around the corner for drinks before. The apps are generally good too and really good salads."}
{"text":"Tasty food, but a seemingly unhappy waitress avoids having an eye contact with customers throughout entire dinner except when she brings up the bill. Staff training should include genuinely nice service. 
With a nice waitress, we could've had a great time here."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time for lunch and dinner and have generally enjoyed it. The pizza is very well made in the neapolitan style (thin crust, charred around the edges) with a variety of toppings and sauce bases. 

They have a really nice prix fixe lunch menu which includes a salad, pizza and a desert. The arincini are  really well done if you are looking for an appetizer and they carry both craft beers and some great Italian wines."}
{"text":"This place deserves all the great reviews it receives.

A crazy popular joint on the oh-so-hot-right-now-Ossington strip.
Be prepared to line up.

Simple pizzas but put together perfectly.
The pizzas are thin crust and one pizza is a good meal for a person.
My favorite pizza would be the spicy eggplant pizza.
With spicy chilli oil. Adds a nice kick!
The desserts are delicious!
The tiramisu is wonderfully creamy and tasty! Not your traditional tiramisu but freaking tasty, so who cares?! :)

Waitstaff are very friendly. Even though they are busy, you don't feel ignored.

One of my favorite places for a slice...er whole pizza for sure!!"}
{"text":"We were referred here via a Yelp event promising a $3 special of their wild blueberry pizza. When we arrived, apparently we were misinformed as this location was not part of the promo (although the event said it was for all 3 locations). We weren't happy since we came all the way from Burlington so we settled with a Napolitano pizza. It was alright, nothing special. The pizza was quite soggy which didn't work out well with the thin crust. 

We were planning on leaving after just sharing the pizza (still hungry!) to go find another place to eat as we were not impressed. Another server came by our table after hearing our unfortunate plan of events and told us to sit tight as they wanted to do something for us. Turns out that although we weren't able to get just a slice of the wild blueberry pizza, Pizza Libretto offered us the wild blueberry pizza on the house. Thanks very much to Brooke for taking ownership of the confusion and offering an alternative. We did not expect this kind of hospitality at Pizza Libretto and will more likely give this pizza joint another try. Very happy with the service and the innovative pizza creations!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunches and dinners and while I'm happy to eat here for either occasion, I have to say that their lunch combos are the better deal. 

For $15 at lunch, you get:
-Your choice of pizza (between margherita or another choice that I can't remember at the moment, but you can upgrade to any pizza on the menu for an additional $3 or so) 
-Choice of appetizer, which I believe is between a greens salad or beet carpaccio (I recommend the carpaccio) 
-A dessert

I also really enjoy the beef carpaccio, which although is not part of the lunch combo, I often like to get on a bed of arugula as part of dinner. 

Pizzas are thin-crust, heated for a short time in the brick oven.  I tend to go for the margherita, but all of them are good, so no need to worry about picking a \"bad\" one.  The one Libretto is known for uniquely carrying though is the duck pizza (don't get it if you really hate rosemary though). 

If you plan to come here during prime lunch hours, definitely book at least several days in advance.  Otherwise, you're looking to at least 2pm before you can get a seat.  This place is popular for good reason!"}
{"text":"This place ...wow...  the food is super fresh, and we loved our salad and pizza... the middle was a bit limp but overall very italian and very yummy!  Im sure the kitchen was super clean cause it's open!!!   the budino is what you wanna try for dessert!!  Service was amazing... super friendly... I liked this place a little more than the Danforth location, but can't really say why... vibe?????  Will try pasta next time... small menu but I guess that means they perfect everything on it :)"}
{"text":"This place was so amazing we came back the next night!! The staff were so friendly and they really worked as a team. Even the manager was helping out and stopped by our table for a chat. On to the pizza!! No matter what kind you order it will be delicious. I had the eggplant the first night and it was still great the next morning."}
{"text":"This week I had my second visit at Pizza Libretto, the first was several years ago.

I had fond memories of the arugula salad and was not disappointed when we ordered it again. A lovely starter, accompanied by four small slices of bread, and a dish of oil and balsamic vinegar combined. Two slices were of a whole wheat variety and two were white, but a white of a light, airy texture, both were fantastic.

We had the pizza special, which came with swiss chard, house made sausage and roasted garlic. It was amazing. I never would've thought to put swiss chard on a pizza. 

A note on the crust, which is unique. The pizza crust is a Neapolitan crust and this is one of the few places certified out of Italy that can make it. It's both chewy and soft as well as having a firm edge. I typically find its easier to eat the middle (small section of the triangle) by cutting it off and using my fork, and then the top part of the slice by hand. Because of the crust type, trying to pick up the whole slice is a bit sloppy. I love this crust. 

I can't forget to mention the feature dessert - house-made, pumpkin spice gelato. This just topped the visit off and made it pretty darn perfect. You need some of this, so you should go. 

The restaurant got quite loud about 20 mins after we sat down, it's a small space and a busy one, with lots of people picking up takeout as well as eating in. I prefer a quieter place to eat and have a conversation, but sometimes, you need a Neapolitan pizza."}
{"text":"pizza fest with great friends at pizza libretto. From the caprese salad that will make your taste buds dance to wide variety of irresistible pizza's with amazing flavours made on an amazing pizza crust that will leave you wanting more. Must try the prosciutto pizza with lots of arugula and try it often! In the mood for something lighter then margarita pizza is just right for you with a few drop of in house hot oil that takes the flavours to another level. Pizza libretto you did it again and again and again!!"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are just absolutely tasty and delightful!!  They are thin crust, and full of fresh, high quality toppings!  Service is great and ambiance is the hip, cozy type you would expect for a dinner spot in the Ozzy.  This place gets busy and does not take resos so come early or be prepared to wait.  The downside is that the place is very small so it can feel quite squished and that you are literally eating with the stranger next to you cuz s/he is seated so close!!  Price is also relatively high compared to other gourmet pizzerias ($18 for a salami pizza that I can finish on my own!), but not unaffordable.  I'd also like to see more beer selection - as that's always a good drink to have with pizza!!

Overall a great Pizzeria joint and I would recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"The calamari was really delicious and good portion. However, the white pizza was not an impression for me as a signature dish on the menu. I ordered tiramisu and strawberry ice cream for dessert but it were the same with tiramisu and strawberry ice cream everywhere and really pricy."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm a big fan of Libretto, and almost cried with joy when they opened right beside my office. I dropped by with some colleagues for a quick lunch and ordered the lunch special (salad, pizza and gelato for $15).

The food came quickly and the arugula salad was very tasty. The pizza was excellent as always and I really enjoyed the vanilla affogato (gelato with an espresso shot poured over it).

The decor was fresh and bright, with lots of natural light which made for a nice informal ambiance. All of my colleagues loved their meals too, and the price wasn't bad. Definitely my new favourite payday lunch place!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to serve the best pizza I've had in Toronto. Been many times, and time and again the pizza delivers!

Their appetizers are also great!

Been to the Ossington and Danforth locations. Food is consistent for both, and the staff at Ossington is great."}
{"text":"After hearing all these rave reviews about this place it's always been on my list to go. 

The wait was actually very short.  The person at the door said it could be anywhere between 5-30 minutes, but if we leave her our number, she'd call when a table was ready.  Very convenient.  Our wait was probably about 6 minutes so we never ventured off elsewhere.

The waiter was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the duck confit pizza and my husband ordered the sardine pizza.  The sardine pizza was overly salty and it was so bad that we sent it back for something else.  Something that we rarely ever do.  He subbed it with the grilled eggplant pizza and this was AMAZING.  

Now let's talk about the crust.  It felt like pizza toppings on a piece of pita bread -- floppy and not crispy at all.  I've never had Neapolitan pizza, so I can't say if this pizza truly tastes like it.  I've made better pizza crusts at home.

Can't really say I'd come back here again, but the service was great and our waiter was very understanding when we didn't like the pizza."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from and friend and really liked it!

Great atmosphere and didn't have to make reservations, we were able to get a table and were given a reasonable 1.5 hour time slot before a reservation coming in. 

Love the decor it's really homy and comfortable, there is a good space and it's not too cramped. 

The service was good, attentive and fast just a little awkward. 


The pizza was just how the server described it at the beginning of our meal. It's a Neapolitan style pizza that's baked in 900 degree oven which comes out a bit charred on the sides and soft in the middle but still thin crusted. It was perfect. Our meal even came with bread to start! 

Definitely going to return here to get my pizza cravings satisfied."}
{"text":"Although super busy, it's worth the wait. Been to this location a couple of times and love the service and of course, the food! Plus, the last time I went I wanted the tiramisu to go, which they provided me in little mason jars (just a dollar more), which was such a nice treat to then bring back for my best friend as she was having a rough day."}
{"text":"This was one of the best pizza's I've had outside of Italy.

Great thin crust pizza.

The texture was spot on, fantastic crust, chewy but crispy, flavor was also amazing.  I'm sad we didn't go back the next night like my husband suggested...as I wanted pasta, so we didn't, what an idiot I am.

I can't say enough good things about this pizza.  It was about a 12\" pizza and sadly I at the whole thing, less some of the crust, same with my husband w/his pizza.

The only negative was the long wait (Friday night), we went across the street for drinks and they texted us when the spot at the bar (our table) was ready."}
{"text":"So good that I had to go twice in a 4 days trip to Toronto. Both times the pizza arrived less than 5 minutes after ordering and it was perfect. Margarita with Doppio (double the cheese) is just excellent! For desert you can't go wrong with the malted milk panna cotta"}
{"text":"Our go-to pizza spot. Very authentic, great atmosphere. Family-friendly, great waiting staff and the pizza is top-notch. Best in the city."}
{"text":"Best lunch in the city, their prix fixe menu can't be beat. Not only are the pizzas fantastic but so is the rest of the authentic Italian inspired menu. 

Their salads are a great way to start the meal (arugula salad is always perfectly tosses) and their other apps are a pleasure as well. 

The front table or booths are best for more intimate discussions. Great wine list with plenty of local wines to choose from ."}
{"text":"Always yummy, pizza! the crust can be a bit chewy, so if you're not a fan of that, it may not meet your expectations. I've enjoyed the food every time though!"}
{"text":"Over rated from yelpers who never tryed a real pizza in napoli , over priced , over waited, we had to wait 2 hours for a mediocre pizza , never again.
Our favorite still Napoli Centrale on bathurst and bloor or Via Mercanti on Augusta aveneu."}
{"text":"This was my first time.  The warm olives were good, the pizza was very good, and the chocolate gelato was amazing.  Was it really gelato?  That's what it said on the menu, but on the bill it said ice cream.  Anyway, it was excellent.  

Our server was very good as well.  It was 12 noon on a cold Saturday (it opens at noon) so we got in no problem, but it was filling quickly.

If you've been to Terroni, the pizza is similar, but possibly a bit better."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and made a last minute reservation for 3. Customer service here is so friendly and they accommodated without hesitation.

My friends and I started with olives, bread and calamari. Everything was delicious but the olives seem to have been over soaked. We got the Nduja, margherita with mushrooms and diavola the pizzas were delicious!!  They were just a tiny bit soggy, but this has never happened before so I don't think they should be penalized this once! I got the margherita with extra cheese this time, and if you love a good cheesy pizza definitely spend the extra $2 here and get the extra cheese. 

Finished off with apple butter gelato, chocolate gelato and tiramisu! The gelatos were great, and apple butter was different but good! Tiramisu had a strong taste, so if you're usually picky about your tiramisus maybe don't get one here.

All in all would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love grabbing take out from here. Its so easy. I call at 10:30 am and ask to have a pizza ready for noon.  I usually get the Ontario Prosciutto. Don't forget to ask for the chili oil on the side."}
{"text":"The space is warm with lots of wood. Seating is a bit cramped due to all of the coats and close quarters.

They have a variety of small plate appetizers, salads, pizzas, and drinks. For the pizzas, they have a few sauce choices and a few sauceless bianca choices.

They have some bread to start and the texture and lightness of the bread is great. It would've been a lot better if they hear it and serve the bread warm-- oh well. 

Our server Selena was excellent. Super sweet and friendly and knowledgable about the menu. We had the eggplant pizza and the napoletana. Napoletana was a bit sour and pretty salty and also comes with no cheese.. Selena actually suggested the eggplant pizza and it was delicious! It came out warm and fresh and sliced into four pieces. I would definitely order that again. 

We were too stuffed for dessert but Selena highly recommended them and said that all the desserts are made in-house so I will try to make my way back to check it out. I would go back again"}
{"text":"Easily my favourite place to order pizza. I'd highly recommend the Duck Confit pizza. It's perfection."}
{"text":"So complete and total coincidence but my friends chose this restaurant as our meet up spot just weeks after I was at the Danforth location of this lovely place. This location is much nicer than that Danforth location. They got something right on Ossington that they didn't on the Danforth. I think it's the coziness of the place, or maybe the servers. Either way this place was PACKED on a random Monday night in September. An impressive feat in any city. 

The pizza here is good, no great. It has a real authentic feeling to it. Cooked in 90 seconds flat in a wood burning stove with white tiles all over the outside. We ordered the mushroom pizza (delicious) and the arugula prosciutto pizza (even better).

We were struggling to decide on wine, without hesitation the waiter brought us 4 to try.  All good, all a step up from the typical hum drum. 

Service was great, even going so far as to fill our water glasses up after we paid (a rarity at casual restaurants). 

Anyway, my recommendation is to check it out, this location, NOT the Danforth location."}
{"text":"Been here on a few occasions and definitely ranks as my top 3 pizza places in Toronto. Service was great, environment is contemporary and the facilities are very clean. The pizzas are very well prepared. Thin crust with tasty Mozarella and delicious Italian toppings."}
{"text":"Tried this place again...this time because a few of my friends had picked it (not my choice). Had the caprese salad and marinara d.o.p pizza with ricotta. Caprese salad was ok...beets, cheese and basil. Pretty basic. The marina d.o.p pizza was decent but a bit soggy and the tomato sauce was watery with a whole goop of cheese in the middle. I prefer a firm thin crust pizza with a rich red sauce. Overall, a 2.5 rating at max. Sorry!"}
{"text":"After having my first taste of pizza in new york, Toronto pizza has just become substandard for me. Seriously nothing here is as good. After several disappointments I went through a lot of reviews and found this place that was given a thumbs up practically everywhere I looked. After finally have a taste of pizza neapolitan, I admit it has its great and unique qualities especially with the texture of the dough. I found it slightly expensive and still doesn't beat a $5 slice off pizza in NY. My TO search continues."}
{"text":"Saturday night just around 8:30pm, party of 3? We're willing to wait across the street at Crooked Star. Well, it turns out, we need to wait about a day before we can taste the deliciousness of Libretto, because the wait has creeped up beyond 3 hours and they just can't take any more names. ARGH! I need to carb-load and have been jonesing Pizza from Libretto all weekend. What to do? Take out. Living not so close to Ossington and Dundas, I cabbed it hope to enjoy the 'za.  Once it's cooled off, you might notice different things about a pizza than if you get to enjoy it piping hot from the oven.  The crush here is amazing! The gluten content, which gives it the chewy, stretchy nature to the crust, must be off the charts! Celiacs, be ware! 

Toppings of just basic sauce and cheese are great. A little more basil would add, but I'm not complaining. Still gotta subtract a star for the no-reservations policy. Arrive early, plan to wait at least 2 hours still and leave your celiac friends at home."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic lunch here - the prix fixe menu was great, price and food wise... especially the arugula salad!"}
{"text":"Took my team here for lunch. Great outdoor patio and just as nice inside. 

We all had the lunch special: salad , pizza and dessert. 

I had the arugula salad with pear and walnut, margharita pizza and the biscotti for dessert. 

Service was quick, food was well prepared. Not much else you can ask for when looking for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My go-to pizza place. I have not yet had a better pizza than Librettos! 

Waits are long - for dinner I have waited 30+ minutes even on a Monday. However it is worth it. Make sure you come prepared to wait a while.

Their mushroom pizza is really good, I don't like mushrooms but I love this pizza.  The Nduja sausage one is good too if you like spicy food.  I really love the free bread in the beginning too, always tasty. 

Service has always been good and decor is great."}
{"text":"After having waited for over an hour (at Reposado Tequila Bar a little bit further on Ossington), we were finally seated. The consumed bruschetta and house made sausage pizza were enjoyable, but not to rave about. If you actually believe that this is true Neapolitan pizza, you have never made it to Italy. In the case you have and still believe it, you lack taste or have Alzheimer's.

The service wasn't remarkable either as I was never asked if I wanted some wine. 

Two stars. That is after the standard one star deduction for not taking reservations. Hate that."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice and service has always been fantastic. 

Food: I really liked their mushroom pizza, daily pizza (basil hot sausage mozzarella cheese) and aracini balls. Didn't really enjoy their duck confit pizza though.. too heavy on the rosemary. I like their pizza because the crust is thin and light - not too doughy that I feel gross after and their sauce is very flavourful.

Drink: I've only had their mimosa and it's just... orange juice with cheap champagne

Atmosphere: I've only been to the King location and it is a bit difficult to find as it's tucked between two buildings and looks super sketchy BUT once you go in... it looks completely different and surprisingly bright and spacious.

Service: Both times I was fortunate enough to have an amazing wait staff (even though the dude looked lost half the time) but still amazing.

I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"we waited about 45 mins to be seated but the stone oven pizza was definitely amazing! 

we had one mushroom pizza and one original pizza and added our own greens to it!

the pizza was perfect, and worth the wait.

the only downside was that we were seated right by the door so 1) I kept getting the wind from outside, despite the heater being on and 2) people kept bumping into me or chair that I almost spilt my wine twice."}
{"text":"Went here to catch up with a few friends after work. It's a bit tucked away in a hidden alley but there was a small patio that seemed quaint and dainty.

Once our group of 6 all arrived, we ordered our foods as well all decided to share. We got the Buttermilk Fried Calamari, Nduja Sausage, Pizza Blanca - House-Made Sausage, and Ontario Prosciutto with argula on top.

The complementary bread with oil and balsamic was nice. I enjoyed it. Sadly, that was my best part of the meal.

The calamari was disappointing. There was no flavour and the combination of the buttermilk was just so odd.

All the pizzas came lovely in appearance. However, it tasted so burnt I thought my tongue would turn completely black. The pizzas were also cut into 4 giant slices. Our group attempted to cut the slices into halves but the knifes were so dull that it was going nowhere. We asked our waiter for assistance and he replied with \"well, you could use the fork and knife in front of you.\" We found him quite rude in his approach.

He was also quite rude when it came to sorting the bills out. A few of us had drinks so instead of splitting the bill in 6, we would figure out the total amounts and then add our own drink to it. He offered to do the calculations as \"Libretto is good at that sort of thing\". But he never did it, and we felt he just didn't want to, so my friend offered to put the bill on her credit card and we'd all just e-transfer her back.

TLDR; Not impressed with the food or service here."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I have ever eaten. Napoli-certified, or something like that. Fresh, delicious, hot, melts-in-your-mouth pizza. I came not hungry but left devouring an entire pizza on my own. 
Has a few craft beer choices as well as some tasty house wine. I recommend this place to anyone, tourist or not!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the Pizzeria Lunch Prix Fixe, and it was excellent!

The arugula salad with pear and shaved parmesan was fantastic, great quantity, with a sweet, delicious dressing.  Secondi was the margherita pizza (always a classic), and it was up on there on the 'my favourite pizza' list. The additional $2 for extra cheese was well worth it. I think everyone I ate with was jealous of the choice. The chocolate gelato in a tumbler was the perfect end to a great lunch. And all for $15!

Service was fantastic, very friendly AND attentive. Great setting as well, quaint but lively! All in all, a lovely place to lunch!

One downside, they don't have tea!"}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic with good quality ingredients. Salads are also very good. Tends to get packed very quickly for lunch so plan ahead."}
{"text":"We have high expectations when it comes to pizza, however perhaps Napolian pizza is not our style. We also tried the popular fried calamari, but it looks better than it taste; it was no surprise. I only went once and never felt like I needed to go back for a second chance : ).   When it comes to pizza, my heart is with Maker Pizza still."}
{"text":"Great Arancini balls, pizza was good but not great  and we felt the duck confit needed more of something - it didn't feel \"complete.\"

Overall would prefer the King Street location over this location. Still good though!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal last night! The Arancini balls were a huge hit, the beet caprese salad was good (but could have used an extra kick, like regular balsamic w/ the white balsamic). We also ordered one white (the mushroom) and one red (the eggplant) pizza and I would reorder the mushroom pizza for sure. 

3 of us shared the order, and left full and pleased!"}
{"text":"Got there around open, packed house in about a half hour. Good service, cheap specials, solid atmosphere.  Place was lit!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Made in a high temperature furnace and with thin crust.

The service was excellent. The only problem was the long wait - it took 2 hours to get a table, so plan ahead. We got a good comfortable booth, but the place is pretty tightly packed and not very intimate.  But the perfect spot to get delicious pizza, which sadly and unexplainably is so rare in Toronto (unlike Italy or New York).  Great price as well for the food quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Last week I was walking past the restaurant and 4 Italians straight from Rome walked out talking about how amazing this pizza was... if thats not the official stamp of an amazing pizza, i'm not sure what is! 

The prosciutto and arugula pizza is one of the best dishes in all of toronto. Yes, all of toronto - I've had them all. 

Friendly staff, cool decor and nothing but the wonderful noise of hungry patrons, wine glasses and the coldest steamwhistle on tap surrounds the wooden tables in this restaurant. 

There is a strong chance that their 'specials' warrant the title of 'special', I've had anything from pork cheek to arancini, they never seize to amaze me and all my friends/family that I've taken there. 

Though the wait may be long, giving them your name and phone number while you head down to grab a drink at any of the bars down Ossington is hardly an inconvenience. 

Have fun, sit back, enjoy the pizza (with extra virgin olive oil on the side) close your eyes and repeat 'viva la pizza'. 

Peace, love, prosciutto."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food, but a bit pricey. It was quite busy at 3pm on a Saturday - the restaurant must do very well! 

Started off with bruschetta which was three of the chef's recommendation. It was good. 

The pizza was definitely unique, as the crust tasted like a flat bread (maybe it is a flat bread?! Lol). It made the pizza really good as it was different. Though for the price of the sausage pizza, I wish they were more generous in the meat. But bottom line it was still good. 

Also had a prosciutto sandwich which was also above average. Flavourful piece of meat mixed with greens and cheese.

If you haven't been and want to try out, as other reviewers have mentioned, it'll probably be very packed during core hours. Be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Our 2nd sit down meal in Toronto and I must say this was the best value so far.  We had the prix fixe menu which consisted of bruschetta, green bean/potato/pesto salad, the salami pizza, and the panna cotta with blueberries.

Excellent pizza...and even better panna cotta...I fell in love.

Great service and presentation...you guys have a gem."}
{"text":"Had the sausage pizza and the prosciutto pizza. Delicious. The house ipa beer is also highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A FINANCIAL DISTRICT INTERPRETATION OF THE OTHER TWO LOCATIONS. WELL DONE LIBRETTO.

the place is every bit innovative and unique. talk about transforming a dustry, run down corner of 155 university into a respectable establishment, catching the eye of even the most critical bay street types looking for a lunch joint to eat. in my opinion this place will definitely be on the top when it comes to capitalizing on the trend towards placing trendy restaurants directly in the bottom of office building in the financial district (thin k of earls, speak easy, ki etc)..

place itself 5/5 so the ambiance of the place fits right in of the bat, not to mention the very nice decor which they have managed to pull off, with the rustic pieces of wood/metal of the other locations, combined with the more modern (and rightly so) pieces such as the beautiful UFO chandeliers.Fits on bay st, and caters to hipster angles in a way, good job.

food 5/5, this is consistent with the other restaurant locations, so not much to say here.

4/5 prices are higher than other locations, but fits right into the financial district pricing.

service 5/5, they are always nice during the honeymoon.

the location bit is tricky. it receives 3/5, because while it is aiming to attract lunch goers, for which this should not be too much of a problem, it does not get direct access to the PATH similar to other restaurants, which means your lunch date might have to get her dress (which she put on just for you tonight) dirty in the snow/rain/slush since she is walking from across the street from the PATH. Additionally, while the other locations are convenient if your are driving, since they have street parking right in front, this location is a bit hard to drive to. you will not find parking on the street in front but will instead pay another 20$ to park in one of the buildings.

overall, great execution on the store, welcome to bay st libretto!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever. They have unique pizzas that are absoultly delicious. I've been to the Danforth location 2 times now and have not been disappointed. Can't wait to go back and try another kind of pizza."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto located in Little Portugal is a popular place as it was jammed packed.  I went to Pizzeria Libertto with 3 friends and we ordered 3 pizzas and buttermilk calamari.  I really like the buttermilk Calamari which was stacked like a pyramid; it was perfectly made and it was crunchy.  The pizzas are a little too doughy for my like  but it was fresh and tasty.  The service is really really good as our server keeps coming to refill out water every time he walked by and asking if everything was okay.  The place itself was packed and we had to wait for an hour for the table, the decor is nice and modern.  Atmosphere was good but was pretty loud I couldn't even hear my friend from across the table.  The seating is cramped unless you get the booths.  Pricing is around $18 a pizza which is okay for high quality food.

Rating:

Service: 5/5
Food Quality: 3/5
Comfort 2/5
Decor  4/5
Value: 3/5
Parking: 2/5"}
{"text":"VPN :  the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana is an international organization of Neapolitan people representing the oldest and most famous Neapolitan pizzerias. The association was established by Italian government as a denomination of control (DOC), which allows themto give special designation to those who meet strict requirements that respect the tradition of the art of Neapolitan pizza making.

Always start with the Margherita, VPN pizza simplicity which is the baseline that allow the purest and fresh of the ingredients to shine. In addition, the dough and sauce are really the  stars here and everything should just compliment them. 

PIZZA D.O.P. Margherita : Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella (\"Doppio\" extra mozzarella)

After several visits of tasting, in my opinion the center is a bit of a fail to my taste. The texture a bit to soft and chewy with the appearance of under cooked dough. On my second visit I had them reduce the sauce for 2 reasons. The first was that it had the most sauce that I have had on a VPN style pizza. I mean, it wasn't a ridiculous amount by any means. But for my second point, I hoped that the center would be more evenly cooked and more completely cooked. 

My friends laughed and snobbishly told me that I don't understand VPN. This may be and thus would make this place the King of VPN because I have never had this same experience at any other VPN. That is, while other VPN pies where tender and charred, I hadn't find a center that soggy and doughy. Yet, I can't flaw my Toronto friends because this seems to their first and maybe only VPN exposure. So this will be their standard in which they judge others pies. 

Bottomline; still go this place!  The pizza was really good, after the first bite or two this was one of the best VPN pizzas that I have had."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday for their prix fixe lunch, which includes a salad, basic pizza and dessert.
We got one prix fixe lunch (Caprese salad, margherita pizza, chocolate gelato) and one duck confit pizza, with a side of calamari. 

The calamari was amazing. Very generous and beautifully arranged on the place. Every piece was nicely fried and the romesco sauce paired well. Would go back just to order this! 

Their pizzas were underwhelming. The crust was chewy but in a soggy way and not an outside crispy kind of way. This was disappointing since you can see them fire them up in an oven in the open kitchen...maybe the temperature wasn't hot enough. The duct confit with pear wasn't a tasty combination and there was so little duck that it became a pear pizza. Another thing we disliked about it was that whole sprigs of rosemary were placed on the pizza, which is very difficult to eat and the rosemary taste is too dominating. 

Gelato was good, but gelato's gelato.

Conclusion: would only recommend the calamari here, it's the real winner."}
{"text":"La pizza traditionelle par excellence dans le quartier d'Ossington. Le restaurant est victime de son succ√®s il faudra donc patienter 1 √† 2h avant d'avoir sa table.
L'attente en vaut la peine, toutes les pizzas sont cuites au four traditionnel et le cadre est √† la fois moderne et retro √† la fois. Id√©al pour diner entre amis ou en amoureux.

The best traditionnal pizza place in Ossignton. The restaurant is so good you will have to wait between one and two hours befor getting a table.
The waiting is worth though : all the pizzas are baked in traditionnal ovens and the place itself has a mix of modern and traditionnal at the same time.
Good place to go to diner with friends or bring your date ^^"}
{"text":"Soggy Pizza and Bad Service!!!!

Came here on a Saturday evening, expected to wait to get a seat, not our first time here. However, the following is not justifiable. We were seated at the bar. Did not know who our server was. We were given water and a menu. After 10 minutes of waiting we asked the bartender to order food because no one came to take our order. It probably took a good 30 to 40 mins for the food to arrive, which is surprising when it takes 90 seconds to cook a pizza. I can go order a pizza from one of the many franchises in Toronto and it would probably be ready in 20mins.

During this time, We were not offered or given any bread. Like I said, I have been here before, so I know that they offer bread. I saw other tables were given bread, even other people at the bar had bread.

The service only started to improve after we got our food, the bar tender filled our classes of water and the water jug. 

The default tip percent is 17% on the credit card handheld device. Come on, really? 

In Conclusion, the place is probably too busy for itself. Some kind of process needs to be changed so that they can produce food quicker as well as address some of their service issues."}
{"text":"What. The. Fuck. 

I saw this place on Yelp and we walked for a solid 20 minutes to get here in the cold. I could deal with the fact that there was a wait because it's supposedly popular, but there's no place to wait in the entrance. Once we were seated a half-hour later, we hungrily perused the menu. 

Our server was awkward and made herself scarce. She came by to make strange comments, forgot to take drink orders from half our table, and generally gave off a weird vibe. There were four of us, so we decided to split three pizzas, buttermilk calamari, and an arugula salad. Arugula salad was refreshing. Buttermilk calamari was okay. And then came the pizzas.

We got: a salami pizza, a roasted cremini mushroom pizza, and a special pizza (with prosciutto, goat cheese, onions, etc.). All of our pizzas were burnt. Not just like a little crisp on the side, but like an unpleasant burnt crunch. The salami was too burnt, the roasted cremini had an overwhelming amount of rosemary, and the special was an odd combination of flavors. Just unappealing. I was so disappointed by all three, I didn't get to eat a proper dinner. So fucking mad. Still pretty fucking mad. In fact, every time I pass by this place, i AM INFURIATED. FULL OF REGRET. How is this considered a top restaurant in Toronto?! 

It took forever to get our server to bring our check. I think she could tell we weren't having any of that shit. She had attitude the whole time we spoke to her; do you think this deserves a good tip? I don't. 

Bad service with a side of attitude is on the menu, it seems. She boxed up second helpings of bitch and gave us that to go. Would not come here under any circumstance. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Cosy, noisy (in a very good way!), excellent  pizza, good wine selection, friendly service, and very warm, authentic Italian atmosphere. Yes, you will have to wait for a table and yes, you will most likely seat in a very close proximity with people you've never met, but it's so worth it. No question about it - 5 full stars!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Pizzeria Libretto. 
The pizza's are pretty damn good.
I love the thin blistery crust and the stretchy pizza dough. YUM.

The house-made sausage pizza is really really good and so is the Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula pizza.

The real star item is the bruschetta. They typically have 2. Make sure you have the proscuitto with olive tapenade and  Buffalo Mozzarella - it's better than the pizzas!

Servers are nice and friendly.

Make sure you go early because the queue gets quite long."}
{"text":"I feel like it's unfair for me to write a review for this restaurant since I didn't exactly eat in... So just know that my rating is strictly for the food. Specifically the pizza. Even more specifically, the margherita pizza.

Best. Pizza. Ever.

You know that saying, \"Simple is best?\" Well, they definitely keep it simple, and yes, it really is the best. I adore the crust here because they manage to make it delightfully chewy with a great crunch... The kind of crust you can fold in half without it breaking. And don't forget the side of chili oil!

If you need any more support for why it's the best pizza ever, just refer to all the other great reviews this place received... Or better yet, go grab a pizza from this place and try it yourself already!"}
{"text":"I'm writing a review for Pizzeria Libretto... Again. Why? 2 reasons.

1) I am obsessed with their pizza and you will be too, very soon (are you making a reservation yet?). Love their thin, chewy crusts... fresh, tangy tomato sauce... and their chili oil! The calamari and their Nduja Sausage pizza are my must-haves when I come here.

2) The entrance of this location is kind of tucked in a small alleyway so keep your eyes peeled. It's right by Porchetta (look out for the neon pig sign!)

Also... Did anyone else notice the quality of their napkins? #Legit"}
{"text":"Folks this is a welcome relief for the downtown core as there is a big gap for a decent pizza place (Other spots have been inconsistent to say the least). I started with a good impression of their original location but that went downhill after the last two visit so wasn't too keen on visiting that location. This spot is a lot more convenient and has a much more inviting setup. Large open space that isn't as noisy as the original. Service is a lot better as well. 
I went for the margherita and DC ordered the grilled egg plant. In addition we ordered the arancini. 
Arancini was quite good. Nice crisp outside with gooey rice covering and even more gooey cheese in the center. Nice kick on the sauce. Good start.
The pizza them self are not soggy like the original spot has served int he last two instances. I think they have a bigger list for beers than the original. They do take reservations but we did a walk in. I have hunch one would have better luck on walk in on the weekend as office crowd is away. 
4 Stars."}
{"text":"Went with friends on a Sunday. Friendly , prompt service. Beautiful ambiance. The pizza was fantastic, some of the best I've had in the city. I wouldn't hesitate to visit them again! Price point is just right in my opinion."}
{"text":"- so i finally figured out the best way to get into this busy joint for dinner.... go mid-week prior to the christmas holidays!
- couple of notes, since there are so many other reviews on this place:

* although the buttermilk calamari seems/sounds interesting... it's pretty average. tastes like calamari mixed with onion ring batter, which overpowers the flavour of da sea...
* the homemade duck prosciutto is dynamite
* margarita pizza.... equals happiness."}
{"text":"It had been over a year since I had last treated myself to Pizzeria Libretto, come to think of it I am not sure why it took me so long to return. The $15 lunch special is hands down THE best current lunch option in Toronto. 

For that fee you receive a beet caprese salad (Ontario fiore di latte, basil, seedlings, olive oil) OR an arugula salad (pear, walnut, piave, sherry vinaigrette). The salads were good but I feel they could have made them better. The beet salad would most certainly jump off the plate if they were to drizzle a rosemary or herb infused balsamic reduction over the top, a basil or parsley puree would be a welcome touch as well. Beets were cooked perfectly and the salad was tasty, however it could have jumped off the plate a bit more. The arugula salad was underdressed with the vinaigrette but nice combination of flavours. For $15 you can not complain, this lunch special showcases their pride and glory, the pizza, and that is all that really matters here. 

Both of their D.O.P. (Protected designation of origin) pizza's are offered with this special and they are both outstanding. It is truly rare to have an authentic Napoli style pizza which adheres to the strict guidelines set out by the Italian Government and European Union. You are a winner if you select either of these 2. However, if you spend an additional $5 you are privy to any pizza on the menu, and since I am a raging carnivore this is clearly my route. I opted for the Nduja Sausage pizza (tomato, garlic, oregano, basil, mozzarella, stracciatella. Nduja is a spicy sausage of Calabrian origin and it is incredible. As I mentioned above I believe the pizza had become even better from the last time I slayed it over a year ago. It had a certain airiness to it and it seemed more elastic then before. I was amazed at the flavour profile and I loved seeing thinly shaved Goodfellas style garlic all over the pizza. Unbelievable pizza, I eat pizza everywhere in the city, every nook and cranny, this is still the best. I'm having hot flashes as I type. 

For dessert we had the choice of one scoop of the following gelatos:  Vanilla, chocolate or biscotti dough-chocolate chip (daily special), or regular biscotti itself. You already know which one I chose. 

The biscotti dough-choco chip gelato came off more as an ice cream to me but nonetheless delicious. Big chunks of chewy biscotti dough were riddled everywhere and it was a great way to end off the meal, considering how much chili oil and chili flakes I used on my pizza prior. 

Easily the best $20 (before tax/tip) I spent on lunch in a long time. Great bang for your buck considering most of their meat pizzas range between $16-19.

I can not wait for another day off. 

***Pls note this deal is Mon-Fri 11a-1pm."}
{"text":"This was my second time enjoying pizza from Pizza Libretto. Like the first, I had no reservation having called the night before and being told there was no availability at my desired time but that we were more than welcome to walk-in. And walk-in we did. Both times I've been easily accommodated waiting only a few minutes for a table (once at the bar - which was still a great experience!)

My friend and I each took part in the Winter prix fix menu which is by far one of the best deals I've ever seen. A pre-selected app, choice of starter salad, ANY pizza off the menu, followed by the cutest tiramisu in a mason jar. All for just $25 - amazing. We both really enjoyed our fried dough ball app which is probably something I wouldn't normally order so it was fun to try. I had the arugula salad with pecans which was light and quite large. I didn't finish the whole thing in anticipation of my Cremini mushroom pizza (PHENOM!) and dessert. 

It was my friend's birthday and we were in a bit of a rush to meet others at a bar around the corner but our waitress was great at wrapping our leftover pizzas in a box and even making our tiramisu desserts to-go friendly. All in all, another great experience here. I would definitely recommend and come again in an instant."}

{"text":"Seated immediately on a Thursday evening. Server was really nice, very helpful & even asked if we had any allergies she needed to know of. All food and wine was brought to the table pretty quickly- that was pretty impressive. Great appetiser to recommend is the Calamari!!! Pizza was delicious too :) thanks everyone at Pizzeria Libretto"}
{"text":"This area gets more action than a bar on UFC night...crazy I know. Libretto probably fuelled that when it first opened its doors. I've never seen so many sober people wait for pizza - that sentiment will be lost on you if you've never walked by a downtown pizza joint at about 3 am.


If you like Neapolitan pizza Libretto is a lively, down-to-earth place to eat with friends. The seating (they have some communal tables) fosters a carefree environment and service is great, oftentimes entertaining (there are some characters here I tell you). 


If I had to recommend something it'd be the beef carpaccio with shaved piave cheese. It's a great prelude to what's going to be a great meal. My two favourite pizzas are the Duck Confit and Margherita D.O.P. The first because I'm a raging carnivore, and the second because basil and mozzarella is a winning combination. 


Finish with the Vanilla Afogato, pat your belly, and roll on home."}
{"text":"This is a place that had such great reviews I truly believed the  buzz ; don't ! A promise of a great pizza , in our neighbour could have been a God send . It wasn't. The staff seemed frazzled fending off complains .Our waitress was close to tears, so we're generous , paid the check and fled this horror show. We were so disappointed ! Never in a million years would I recommend this mediocre.place!!@"}
{"text":"This is the third location and they are starting to get cocky. Now they think they are better than what they really are and this is never good. The food at this particular location seems lacking TLC and more like a production line. Libretto is all about atmosphere and less about the food or quality. I think they feel if they serve mediocre food with attitude no one will notice the food is not that good. Toronto is not known for good pizza and this place does nothing to remedy this. Good luck at this location."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out on a night that I was in the mood to wait. They even let me drink a glass of wine while loitering in their entryway, so points for that.

Seriously though: all this stuff about this being the only authentic pizza makes me laugh. My grandmother, who is Italian, never, ever, EVER made thin crust pizza. Ever. Granted, she wasn't from Naples. Still though, I consider her pizza legit.

However, the pizza is pretty good and it comes out fast. I had the house-made sausage pizza, and it was certainly tasty. The ingredients were all fresh. But in the end....it's just pizza!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Pizza Libretto - excellent Pizza. Just loved it. 4.5 stars, 

So happy this location opened up close to work on University. I wanted to try this Pizza for almost two years... Happy to say I was not disappointed. 

What a nice surprise - about 6 craft beers on Tap. This always makes me happy. Good wine selection as well.

Service was excellent during the busy lunch hour. The server explained the menu and eagerly offered recommendations. He checked in on us throughout the meal as well.

Started with the Beet Salad. Nice portion and the Mozzarella was perfectly fresh. Just melted in your mouth.

On to the pizza. We ordered two Pizza's to share - the Margherita and the sausage. OMG this Pizza is stupid good. Loved the homemade tomato sauce, crust was nice and thin, cooked perfectly. Topped with that super fresh mozzarella again. The sausage was excellent, nice and spicy - incredible flavor. 

Yummy in-house Vanilla Gelato to end this perfect meal. 

What can I say... I can't wait to return and try all the Pizza's. 

TIP - $15 lunch special - app, full pizza and dessert... What a deal for food of this calibre. Note - some of the specialty Pizza's have an extra $5 charge ($20 lunch special).

BK"}
{"text":"Yep, big fan. My new go-to for a delicious lunch. You can't go wrong wth a $15 prix fixe lunch special - app, main, dessert. So much bang for your buck it's ridculous. I've even been spoiled with a delicious digestif bitters on recent visits. 

Dinner service at Libretto's is next...
 
Honourable mentions: 
- the pizza crust is just right - the leftovers are equally tasty when consumed cold
- incredibly attentive and friendly staff, not to mention easy on the eyes"}
{"text":"A classic place, absolutely delicious.

Depending on my mood, I rotate between Libretto, North of Brooklyn, and Maker Pizza.

It's comfortable, reliable, and damn delicious to boost. A winner."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was just okay. Not great but not horrible. They had a really good beer selection, but as the only wine drinker at our table, I was disappointed. Our table started with a charcuterie platter. There wasn't anything wrong with it - the candied pistachios were delicious - and I get that they were trying to go with their signature by serving it with pizza dough, but it didn't go well together in my opinion. I had the pizza with housemade sausage, caramelized onion, basil, and chilli oil. Others at the table had the duck confit pizza, the other sausage pizza (with red sauce), and the signature margarita pizza. I liked the flavours on my pizza - the housemade sausage was good. I did not like the crust. I haven't had a lot of other Neapolitan pizzas, so I don't know if my dislike was specific to pizza libretto or to the style of pizza, but it felt soggy and even though I could see the blistering and black bits from the oven, I didn't taste any of the charring like I expected to. I also sampled the duck confit pizza and while the pear and rosemary went well with the duck, I thought the duck was too dry and the Rosemary pieces too large (whole pieces off the stalk - I would have preferred them finely chopped - I don't like a big piece of rosemary). Service had its ups and downs. They split our bill, including dividing up our shared appetizer, which was very nice of them. However, as the DD that night, I didn't appreciate having to ask for more water twice (especially when one time the waitress was refilling the other side of the table but didn't notice the lack of water on my side). I get that restaurants only seem to care about serving you if they can make money, but that's really unfair to those who want to drink water. This place is not on my list of places I would repeat."}
{"text":"Right as I walked in I was taken aback by the noise level in this place. To be fair it was Saturday evening so most places are bound to be packed. 
After putting out name down we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait and our phone number was taken down in case we wanted to walk around. Kudos for that as we wanted to explore the area.
Almost 30 min later we got a call that our table is ready. The table was towards the kitchen and I thought the noise level would be less but alas it was reaching ear splitting level there. 
After going through the menu we settled on the Margherita and grilled egg plant and thought we would decide on the dessert later depending on how the main's go. I ordered a pint of steam whistle form the very few offerings they have for beer. 
The service was quite good and we were checked on consistently. The Pizzas arrive in about 15 min and looked very nice.
Margherita was top notch. Nice thin crust, strong aroma of basil and right amount of sauce. One of the better Margherita I have had in TO.
Grilled egg plant didn't fare well. The crust was soggy and the sauce was watery. Perhaps it needed 100 second to finish rather than the usual 90 ;) Chilli flakes left a more black pepper like finish which is puzzling. 
On to dessert we ordered a Lemon Panna Cotta and Chocolate Affogato. I didn't try the Panna Cotta but did enjoy my Affogato.
All said and done a decent 3.5 star."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and this place has become a \"has been\" although I would question if it has ever really been a \"go to place\" ever. I would have to say Toronto is known for the consistently worse pizza in the world.  We have pizza on just about ever corner and none of them are good. This place does nothing to remedy this. Many of the pizza places don't use real cheese (eatable oil products from the ground aka crude oil for cheese).  If you are looking for warm and friendly this is not the place for you. The attitude here is not what it use to be. If you like cardboard with \"cheese\" and meat, then this place is for you. It's busy although I have never understood eating at restaurant just simply because it is trendy regardless how bad the food and service. Pizzeria Libretto is all about production, getting you in and getting you out quickly and service along with customer care is out the window. The foods not that great yet for some reason this place is popular. I can't figure it out.. can you? Compared to Leveto, no comparison."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent.
Waitress was excellent.
Atmosphere was great.
We enjoyed ourselves and our stomachs left happy.
If we come back to Toronto, we will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from several friends, I decided to give it a try on a Friday night after work with a friend. I made the reservation a week in advance and when I checked the day of, bookings were completely full.

The restaurant was a lot bigger than it looked from the outside, we were seated near the back where it was quieter and allowed us to chit chat and catch up.

My friend ordered the duck confit pizza and I ordered the house-made sausage pizza. Both pizzas were white pizzas which I personally prefer over tomato based pizzas. The pizzas were a good size to share or have as a personal pizza. However, I thought that the pizzas overall were underwhelming and not what I had imagined based on what others have told me. The pizzas were dry (not much sauce) but also oily from the oil that is drizzled on top of the house-made pizza. 

To finish off, my friend and I decided to get dessert. The espresso cinnamon gelato was super strong, even for my friend who absolutely loves strong caffeine. 

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience but I don't think anything will pull me back to try it a second time."}
{"text":"We had a very large group; 3 tables worth! Unfortunately, we could only get 2 of the tables near each other, but we worked it out to have everyone together. It's a beautiful venue, large windows, high ceilings and comfy booths. As a bonus, they were have featured pizzas that goes towards the MealShare program. This place also has pizzas certified authentic by Italy. Let's do this! 
 
The server was very friendly and knowledgeable about, not only the food, but the certification by Italy and what it means. We ordered the Buttermilk Fried Calamari and I chose the Ontario Prosciutto pizza for my entr√©e. The calamari was pretty good! Not chewy and the batter was crispy and little addicting. It came with a red pepper almond sauce that was to die for. I wanted to dip everything in it. 
 
The pizza was exactly as advertised; super thin pizza with a fluffy crust and fresh toppings. It is not the pizza you have delivered to your house, so don't expect it. The sauce is crushed tomatoes, not tomato sauce. It's more acidic and tomato-y than I expected; the flavours are strong.  There was a generous amount of mozzarella spread over the entire pie. The prosciutto sliced so thin, you could see through it. It was delicious, just like my uncle makes! This is definitely a pizza I could get used to. 
 
It was a Friday night, the service was phenomenal; the place was packed! Our drinks were refilled, plates taken away and tummies full. They even gave us separate bills with no hassle. I now see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"This is a larger, more spacious Libretto than the Ossington joint.  Beautiful high ceilings with cool light fixtures.  

The food is on point.  It's pretty much the same menu.  We ordered the large charcuterie board, two plates of calamari, and 6 or 7 different pizzas to share amongst a group of 10 people.  

Some people ordered some beers and I had a cocktail.  My cocktail was really good.  Something Daughter?  I can't recall now.  

At the end of our meal, two tiramisus were ordered, an affogato, and some coffee.  

The service was very good.  It was attentive and pretty quick too.  I would come back here before heading to Ossington."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable thin-crust pizza - much better than the disgusting Americanized pies dripping in oil.  

They also have some pretty smashing arugula salads (as well as arugula-topping pizzas) that I can't seem to find in other pizzerias around the city."}
{"text":"Not bad. 

Toppings were good, but the dough was much too soggy. Overall, I'd say good, but not great. 

That being said, I'd probably be back to give it another try since I work so close.

Tip: it gets very busy at lunch, so make a reservation well in advance if possible (they do Opentable)"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food came really fast. Not sure what the hype is about this place, I didn't like the pizza at all. Not a fan of the burnt edges. I think Tosto's Funghi pizza is way better. The calamari was good but I felt like I needed more sauce. Beet salad was plain. Everything was presented well. Overall not impressed with the food, the restaurant was packed during the week at lunch though..."}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place for about 3 years now because I love pizza, but being from Richmond Hill didn't make it seem worth it to trek there. But last Sunday I happened to be down, so I decided to take the plunge.

The thing about this place is, well, you can't slam the pizza, but there are tones of places in Toronto with similar pizza for less cash and definitely less of a wait.

We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table (Sunday dinner), which is not their fault, really. But then we had to wait another 30 minutes before our appetizer showed up and 45 minutes after that for the actual pizza. As a guy who hates line-ups but will tough it out if it's worth it, I wasn't very Impressed.

We ordered the calamari to start. Not worth it. The sauce was tasted too strongly of tomato and the pieces were very small and highly chewy. Not even a lemon wedge was found to add that nice zest. For $11, the calamari at Dimmi in Yorkville is still tops in the same price range.

The pizzas were great, but like I said, a lot of places in the city have great pizza. I can't remember the types of pizza our table of three ordered, which sort of tells me that it really wasn't that memorable enough to bring me back. It was good pizza, don't get me wrong, but the hype exceeded the quality.

In all, hipsters will love this place (being in an old Portuguese neighbourhood and all, that's the thing these days) and claim it to be a cool place before it was cool, but... Take it or leave it for me."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here.  Always freshly made with delicious toppings.  Kinda sad the one with the soft egg is no longer on the menu.  That was an awesome brunch pizza!

A few suggestions:

Don't unlock the doors if your restaurant isn't open.  Since I got there early, I actually went in, was told the restaurant wasn't open yet, left, came back, still before noon, but another patron managed to snag the large table in the back.  Grrr...

If we ask for just focaccia bread, please don't give us other types.  It's a waste.  :)
Otherwise, helpful and efficient servers."}
{"text":"Great pizzas (red and white), salads (order the kale), cocktails, service, and outdoor patio. Our group of three also tried a few apps. We lived everything. Not easy to find fabulous pizza in this city."}
{"text":"INTRODUCING ....(echo echo echo).... THE BEST PIZZZZZA...(echo echo echo)....IN TORONTO ...(echo echo echo).  And the crowd goes wild. 

I am from the New York area, and I have never had good pizza in Toronto , ever - until now.  This place is certified Neapolitan pizza.  That means they have to use the exact right ingredients, cook the pizza in the exact right way in a very specific oven.  On top of that some italian dudes have to come onsite and give the thumbs up.   This is no joke when it comes to pizza, and there are not that many certified places outside Italy.

If you have never had this style pizza cooked to these specifications, you are in for a real treat.  The pizza was , of course , amazing.  We also had starters of beet and mozz , some lovely warm olives in oil and risotto balls that were nicer than the Canadian mounted police. 

I have to also mention this champagne drink I had.  It was a bitter mixed with grapefruit juice mixed with champagne.  LOVERLY.  ... and a bottle of some kind of Canadian wine I never heard of but drank the entire bottle none the less."}
{"text":"My favourite neopolitan pizza. I get the duck confit and the nduja spicy sausage, and often the feature pizza is great. Argula or beet salad is the perfect size for a green accompaniment so you don't feel so over carbed from crushing a whole pizza, which is easily done even for a small inactive frail tender 90lb women such as myself. Also the budino for dessert, because no matter how much I eat I still don't gain weight."}
{"text":"Good service. 

Everything else (Aka the food) was bad. I have pretty low standards when it comes to pizza as I really love pizza. But this pizza is just NOT GOOD. It was soggy and disgusting. When you picked it up liquid (not delicious cheese oil) would drip onto your plate. I could make a better pizza in my mini toaster oven on pita bread at home, in fact I'd pick the much cheaper Pizza Pizza  pizza over this."}
{"text":"I love pizza libretto. Without a doubt they are the best pizza joint in toronto. They use fresh authentic ingredients for all they're dishes. One of my fave starter dishes that deserves an honourable mention is the meatballs. 3 huge, delicious, seasoned meatballs on a platter is the best way to tart off an amazing meal here. The pizzas are done in an oven which makes for a lovely atmosphere. The bottom of the pizza is downtowns a little burned but usually is crisp to perfection. There house brew on tap is the perfect mix between hoppy and fresh and pairs beautifully w all the pizza options. Service is very friendly and open to conversation. It can get quite busy so it is sometimes a bit of a wait to get seating and they do not take reZos on weekends. I've always had a lovely experience here and this location has a very open, relaxed atmosphere, with a very cool decor."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Pizza Libretto, and i will definitely be coming back. Our server was kind and thorough. I think he might be new there, but he did a fantastic job. He told us what the pizza of the day was (it was a \"four seasons\" pizza. The 4 quadrants of the pizza each had ingredients that signify the four seasons. Cool idea). He was also sure to ask if we had any allergies. I asked for a 7-up with grenadine, and he brought me a lovely Jamaican ginger ale with a house made grenadine. I really enjoyed it. 

For our apps, we got the flank steak spiedini and calamari. Let me tell you...the flank steak spiedini was delicious. I almost requested a second order of it. The spiedini was on a skewer that also had large croutons on it nestled between the steak. The meat was well seasoned and very tender-not at all overcooked and/or dry. Yum. I don't care what else you get, but if you go to Pizza Libretto and you're a meat eater...don't even hesitate. GET THIS APP!

The calamari was amazing too. I liked the presentation of the calamari being carefully stacked on top of each other to form a triangle. On the bottom of the entire plate was the sauce- a romesco (red pepper and almond) sauce. Now, I kinda feel like all calamari should be served with the sauce at the bottom. No more losing your piece of calamari forever in the ramekin abyss of dipping sauce on the side. 

The bread was delicious holy moly. It is freshly baked on site and it was divine. The crust was firm and the inside was soft-just perfect for soaking up the olive oil and balsamic vinegar while still experiencing that satisfying *crunch*. The bread/oil/vinegar is complimentary, as it should be! I've been to a few other restaurants where they charge you for the bread. Are you serious, other restaurants!?

Lastly, we shared a margherita pizza. I enjoyed it. The crust was very thin-wished it was maybe a tad bit firmer. Other than that, the sauce was delicious as was the actual taste of the crust. Just amazing. Now I'm not the HUGEST pizza eater, but my Italian companion gave it a thumbs up. 

Overall, I am definitely going to be back here...and I'll definitely be getting the flank steak spiedini!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. The staff are friendly and very accommodating. 

The pizza...dare I say...isn't this incredible masterpiece people make it out to be, but it is very good. The dough they use is awesome and the specials are worth trying. Its a chill environment where you can relax and hang out without feeling rushed to order, eat, pay and leave. You can go at your own pace, even if there is a line up. 

They charge extra for parm....boooo....because the pizza needs it, but other than that, it's a good spot with good food."}
{"text":"I came here on Tuesday night for a quick bite. My friend is a big fan and he decided to order the apps. We had the deep-fried gnocchi and a braised beef dish with polenta which I can't seem to find on the menu. Both of the apps were delicious, with the gnocchi being nice and creamy underneath the fried goodness and the braised beef being quite tender and the polenta being nicely cooked.

 For my main I had the homemade sausage pizza with carmazlied onion, chili oil and mozzarella, which was really nice as well. I can see how some people would have an issue with the oil but I really liked it. The sausage was very good and the caramelized onion had a nice sweetness. Super delicious!"}
{"text":"I have to admit it--- I am sort of indifferent to pizza. 

It may be the predictability of the cheese/bread formula, my everpresent although sort of incoherent fear of eating unhealthy (typed while literally warming up a brownie) or my only somewhat substantiated belief that I am lactose intolerant, but pizza rarely gets me. As a result, I went to the absurdly popular, ever lauded Pizza Libretto for the very first time last week, and, you know what? It is pretty darn tasty. 

I popped into the Ossington spot for a lunch special with friends (25 dollars with any pizza, 20 with the traditional \"basic\" ones). 

I had the beet caprese salad to start--- it was beautiful, flavourful and excellent, as was my negroni. My pizza, the prosciutto one, was very good. I'll come out and say it's \"still just pizza\" and risk the wrath of the Yelp community, but it's good pizza- well sauced, thin crust, those little smoky bits on the edges.... Yep. very good indeed.

To finish, I had cinnamon coffee gelato. It was lovely although intense--- I preferred my companions more mellow, vanilla bowl, although I may just be boring.

Atmosphere and service, as you'd expect, are wonderful and helpful.

Recommend this place despite my pizza indifference. Great spot!"}
{"text":"We had the calamari, some cheese balls (forgot where they were called) and meatballs for appetizers. The appetizers weren't large, but pretty delicious. For my main, I ordered a margarita pizza (just the plain one). The pizza was not amazing for the price, but it was a plain pizza, so I can't really complain. If I ever come back in the future, I'll definitely try a pizza with other toppings. I would recommend this place for lunches with friends!"}
{"text":"I love real Italian pizzerias after spending some time in small town pizzerias in Italy. For the most part this place takes the good of what I experienced as an authetic pizzeria - the simple decor, casual atmosphere, and good Italian pizza. They do fancy up the pizza a little more than your average pizzeria and it's more expensive but for the most part it's worth it. 

We had a great server, attentive and didn't push any drinks on us after we ordered water (although we did later get some wine).

Food was great, wine was good and served in simple stemless glasses (my favourite!). Good vegetarian entrees but not vegan friendly for the most part (unsurprising since it's a pizzeria but it's worth mentioning).  

I really enjoyed myself but I have to say, the set up of the seats really turned me off.  We had the option to be served at a bar sitting next to each other or at a long table with other groups on both sides. We chose the bar but it was quite uncomfortable after an hour on the stools but I made the sacrifice in order to be able to carry on a conversation. It's quite a loud place, by the way. 

Despite giving it four stars (which they deserve for the food and the service) I don't know if I'd go back again just for logistical reasons (the long wait and the poor way it's been set up for seating - I like to talk to my dining mates). 

Check it out but do take the above cautions into consideration."}
{"text":"3.5 actually I will say.

I am not Italian nor ever been to Italy, so you could debate I know nothing about \"authentic pizza\". Based on my very personal preferences, things are too chewy. Complementary bread is cold and chewy; pizza dough, not as chewy as the North American style, but still thicker than the way I expect them to be. Pizza is kind of bland, even after I added some chilli infused olive oil. I could taste the grease came from the olive oil, but not the aroma.
I didn't get any dessert since the salad and pizza were pretty filling. The Rocco's salad was totally worth to try and add extra 0.5 point to this experience. You can't go wrong with the plate named by the chef I guess. The Scottish-alike-poached egg was still running inside and just so good on the salad with crispy prosciutto. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great all around... This restaurant is amazing for lunch when you want to get out of the office for a short break! 

Great ambiance, great wine, great food and for great company, pick a great friend! :) 

Pizzas are really good - thin crust, lightly crispy, full of flavors and good size for a meal! Price is reasonable !

This place is always busy during lunch and after work during the week. Expect wait times."}
{"text":"I used to think Pizzeria Libretto had the best pizza in the city. That was back when there was just one location on Ossington. Perhaps the quality went down when they added more locations, or maybe this particular PL is just no good. 

I came here early on a Saturday night with a group of 5. The service was brutal. Rude, inattentive server who barely checked on our table or made eye contact when she passed us. It wasn't busy at all in the restaurant. 

The food was terrible.

We had:
Grilled octopus: 1/5 This wasn't fresh, we sent it back. 
Beef carpaccio . 2/5 - nothing special 
Some type of deep fried gnocchi - 1/5 yuck, not for me. 
A pizza with no cheese and prosciutto and arugula on top - 1/5/ no thank you. The prosciutto was not good. 
Duck confit pizza - 1/5 this was awful. no Sauce, the duck tasted off. The baked pear was the only palatable element of this dish. 
Rocco salad - 1/5 tiny portion of sub par salad with an offensive \"crispy egg\" (deep fried egg).

The main issue here was that the ingredients were of mediocre quality. I could taste it in the rubbery cheese, the flavourless parmesan shavings and the sub-par prosciutto. 

I'll never return to the University St. Pizzeria Libretto . In fact my experience here was so disappointing I'll probably never go to a Pizzeria Libretto again."}
{"text":"Cant say I love it, been twice wont go back for a 3rd visit. Prefer NODO or QUEEN MARGHERITA both are less money and better food/service"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Toronto for the first time a couple weeks ago, and we decided to get lunch in Trinity Bellwoods, as we wanted to explore the neighborhood. Pizzeria Libretto seemed like a solid choice, the original location of a local mini chain (it turned out there was another location right by our hotel) specializing in Neapolitan-style, with a lot of love on Yelp. It was a lovely spot, the kind of place I'd go to again and again if I lived in the area.

We went for a late lunch, around 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and we showed up with stomachs rumbling for pizza. We were seated immediately, but the place was pretty busy for that hour, and I wouldn't be surprised if it got packed during peak meal times. The space was cute and hip, with cool hanging lights and a gallery wall. I liked the atmosphere, which was casual and relaxed but more trendy Neapolitan pizza joint than New York pizza by the slice. Service was friendly and attentive, and there was a full bar. We tried a couple of the rotating guest taps--the Henderson's UPA and the Flying Monkeys Saison, both great. I also tried one of the cocktails--the Toronto, made with rye, Fernet, and bitters. This was excellent, smooth and balanced with the cool herbal flavors of Fernet. It cost $12 Canadian, must cheaper than an equivalent cocktail where I live in LA.

The food was fantastic. We shared a small antipasto platter to start, and it came with a strong selection of meats and cheeses: chorizo, soppressata, lanza, and speck; a cow's milk blue, a nutty sheep's milk, and a cheese made with ale and mustard called Red Dragon. The platter also came with marinated olives; fresh baked bread that might've been made with the pizza dough, pliant and nicely seasoned; and a housemade bomba, a spicy, tapenade-like spread that was delicious with everything.

The pizza was some of the best I've had in recent memory, fresh fired individual Neapolitan pies with bright, flavorful tomato sauce and nicely charred crusts. I got the nduja while my husband stuck with the Margherita D.O.P. and we were both quite happy with our meals. The pizza was thin and floppy, definitely on the wet, soggy side, the slices easier to eat folded up. I guess it could've used a little more structure, but it tasted wonderful. The nduja came with tomato, garlic, oregano, basil, mozzarella, stracciatella, and plenty of zesty nduja sausage. Really good stuff.

This was a tremendously satisfying meal for two hungry people craving beer and pizza. We had a great time at Pizzeria Libretto, and would recommend it to anyone looking for Neapolitan-style pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"Consistently great good and service. Every time I've come here, I've had a different pizza, and they are all tasty. Sometimes it can be hard to get a seat, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is perfection.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  Just go during lunch when you won't have to wait and you can get a fabulous (and generous) prefix for $15.  

Best?  

Calamari appetizer with cornmeal crusted rounds and a lovely red pepper dipping sauce that is so much more than the sum of its parts.

Wonderful beet salad and a rotating menu of delightful bruchetta apps (never had one that wasn't terrific).

The star of the show: the margarita pizza.  It's just the best damn pizza in town and the other Neapolitan spots just don't come close.  The sauce on the pizza is oozing with fresh basil flavour.  Crust is thin and crisp but chewy at the same time.  Everything is seasoned to perfection.  

Don't forget to ask for a little jar of their homemade hot peppers.  You take the jar home and they charge you about $6 for it, but it is so worth it.  

I could go to this restaurant everyday and never tire of it or ceased to be impressed by the quality.  

In the words of Sinead \"Nothing compares to you...\"

Vegetarian Score: 8/10.  You get all the stars and just miss out on some of the side acts."}
{"text":"Great selection of wines in various sizes, and great service. But the pizza! Meh, I've had better. Much better. I ordered the Nepolitana (anchovies, fried garlic, tomato sauce and olives). The crust was nicely blistered and the pizza smelled great. But there was far too much sauce and within a few minutes the pizza was very soggy. The sauce was also not my favourite-- really acidic and thick. Maybe this was because of the amount of it, but this was not the Libretto I remembered from years back. 

Calamari was ok. But the red pepper sauce that it came with was not very good. Nice on it's own but  really not well thought out with the fried calamari. It almost tasted like there was carrot in it. Flavours were very disharmonious and I really can't see why people flock to this place. Maybe it was an off night, but this was not great pizza. 

I gave 3 stars for the nice staff and the great wine list."}
{"text":"If you're craving libretto, this is a great option as long as there is not an event at the ACC.  Stepped in here during the holidays and was able to easily get seated for dinner on a Friday night.  The other two locations would have had line ups out the door.

Quality is pretty consistent with the libretto on Ossington.  Dough is a tad more soggy but was cooked through and overall delicious.  Calamari is a hit.

Ambiance is a bit different.  I get it, it's meant for the financial district where conversations over meals trump loud, hip music.  The music is soft and corny and the lights are bit brighter.  Not a bad thing.

Our service was great."}
{"text":"Me, my brother and sis in law decided to go to Pizza Libretto on Sunday evening since we heard this place was good. This place seemed busy as soon as we arrived but we got seated immediately. We started off getting the buttermilk calamari which was hot and fresh and the sauce around it was this chutney and red pepper almond sauce which was delicious. For drinks I had Gragnano Red wine which was perfect with calamari. My sis in law had glass of reisling which she enjoyed too. My bro happened to grab their awesome iced tea which tasted like southern homemade sweet tea. When it came to decide on pizza, my sis in I decided to share since we grabbed mikky dz earlier. I grabbed the special of that day which had basil, red pepper, prosciutto, gorgonzola & mozzerella and I just scarfed it down since it was so good. My bro ordered the Nduja Sausage which is one of their signature dishes and it had a great kick to pizza. Overall we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere was a friendly, family vibe but still had younger couples on a date, I guess call me the third wheel in this situation but it was hella worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. Super thin, tasty charred crust. The 15.00 lunch fixed prix is a terrific deal. Arugula salad, doppio margherita, and vanilla icecream with a splash of espresso. Best lunch deal in the area."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 4th visit to Libretto and once again was amazing.  It was an hour and half wait but is always worth it. 

Tonight my boyfriend and I had the special, which was soppersata (don't think I spelt that right) with cayan infused maple syrup. My boyfriend was unsure if he would like it but it was insanely good!  We also had the margarita. I have had that many times and was still really good.  

I'm sure we will be back in a month or so :)"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Probably one of the best in the city. These people make artisan pizzas that not only look good on paper but taste amazing. They are definitely pricey for what you get but the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Naples pizza in Toronto?  Well kind off.  This is not my first time at this establishment.  The first time I came (years ago) I felt that the pizza was as authentic as in Naples.  I was disappointed this time. 

There is something wrong with the dough, it's becoming Americanized.  Sure it has elements of the real thing, but it is not what it used to be.  Not as fragile and not as blistered as before.  Far too dense. The mozzarella was far from authentic, the size of marbles rather than the large molten golf ball size ones that you would expect.  

Don't get me wrong it's still really good pizza. Just not authentic like before. 

The same thing goes for the gelato.  You can't pass ice cream for gelato. Sorry. 

On the positive side the $15 lunch special is a great deal.  Just don't think you are eating authentico.  That is better left to another nearby establishment."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto once or twice every year; accordingly, I have make my dining selections very carefully. I had been itching to try Pizzeria Libretto for a while, as I LOVE Neopolitan style pizza, but the fact that I watched \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Pizza\" on the Food Network on my flight over really sealed the deal for me.

My sister and I dropped in for lunch on a Friday. We arrived within a half hour of opening, and it was already quite busy. The restaurant was very nicely decorated; my only complaint might be that tables were a bit too close together. Our charming server greeted us immediately and brought over water. He inquired as to whether we had any questions about the menu, but we had already studied the menu beforehand and knew exactly what we wanted. We both ordered off of the prix fixe menu, which was a steal at $15. I ordered the arugula salad to start and the margherita pizza as my main.

We were brought over some complimentary bread with an oil and vinegar dip, both of which were fantastic. The arugula salad was perfect: not overdressed with a wonderful balance of flavours from the pear, cheese, and walnuts. I was already super-impressed, but when the pizza arrived I was over the moon. Honestly, I think I prefer the crust at Pizzeria Primastrada in Victoria a little bit more, but this pizza was absolutely delicious. Of course, there was still dessert to be had, and my sister and I chose two different flavours of gelato: vanilla and espresso cinnamon, which we mixed and matched to our great delight.

Overall, my experience here was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. The food was excellent, the ambiance was excellent, the service was excellent (our server discreetly brought over another bottle of water after we gulped down the first one, which was greatly appreciated), and the value is unbeatable. I look forward to returning on my next bi-annual journey to T.O.!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place, I've been to all the locations and have eaten pizza in many restaurants in Italy and Pizzeria Libretto is comparable to authentic Napoletana pizza.  I thought I had the best pizza at Da Michele in Napoli, Italy, but when I tried this place, meraviglioso!!!!  A must try, best pizza in the city, great service and this new location and the atmosphere is city chic.  BTW I had pizza with prosciutto and arugula and now I need to go back, yummoooo!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at a Libretto and I think it was a miss for me, but a hit for dinner date.

Definitely 5/5 for location and service. It is closer to the downtown core than the two others, which was why my friend and I decided to give it a try. We were seated close to the kitchen so it was nice watching them toss the dough!

3/5 for food. We weren't super hungry so decided to stick to ordering a pizza each. My friend asked for a recommendation (the nduja sausage pizza) and I perhaps was a bit too adventurous/ambitious and ordered the white anchovy. They give you bread to start but the pizzas arrived shortly after. I was pretty impressed with everything up to this point, until I cut into my first slice. I found the taste too bland. My friend's pizza was definitely more flavourful yet still unimpressive. One thing I did enjoy was that dough was really chewy and thin!

I still have mixed feelings about Libretto and will probably be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I love going here! I seriously think they have the best pizza crust in town; they ruin all other pizzas for me. The funghi pizza is great and I've never had a disappointment with any of the appetizers. It is busy and noisy but a lot of fun on a double date. Decor is minimalistic but pleasing. I suspect the King St location is a lot better than the one on University. It's in the clubby area of downtown and honestly I've contemplated ordering my drunk pizza from here multiple times but have refrained to avoid making an ass of myself in front of their lovely servers. You're welcome, guys."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. Had the fried gnocchi which was amazing! Also had a pepperoni pizza which was also great! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Completely.  Mouth watering.  The best pizza I've had outside of Brooklyn, or Italy, for that matter.  For me, the pizza was better than Terroni.  So there!
Fresh ingredients of only the highest quality.  Price was reasonable.   3 piece of their fantastic bruschetta selections, 1/2 litre of mid-range wine, 2 pizzas came to only $60.  
I can't stop thinking about it, and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I booked a lunch here - there were 6 of us in total. Our first visit had some issues with respect to the timing of our food coming and we ended up having to take all our pizzas \"to go\". The manager contacted me afterwards, apologized for the inconvenience and sent us a gift card so that we could return for a better experience, which we did. Our second visit was wonderful - we all ordered the same meals as the first time, the service was friendly and the delivery of our meals to the table was very quick. While the actual table we requested was still not quite right (one of our patrons had mobility issues and needed a low table), we still were able to be seated in a large booth and enjoy our meals. The manager came by several times to apologize about the table mix up and offered us extra desserts, and then also ended up waving the balance of our bills for which the gift card did not cover. That was very nice to see - that the management of this location really does want to make the experience as best as it can be for the patron, and when it's not - they will do what they can to rectify the situation to ensure that you leave as a happy customer. To me, that is a job well done. Oh, and the pizza here is DELICIOUS!!!!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very cozy hipish place. Good preseco. Good limited wine selection. Good organic beer. Good prosciutto pizza. Brooke is a great server!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Ordered buttermilk fried calamari to start with the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the special pizza of the night - lemon fennel sausage pizza.  I love thin crust pizza but found their crust to be a little too thin that it was a bit soggy from the sauce.  The lemon fennel sausage pizza was especially soggy since it was a bit more saucy."}
{"text":"In and out in 45 mins. How does that sound to you? 

That being said, this is a popular joint, something which I knew in advance of our visit. Given that knowledge, we stopped in to put our name down on the list before we went home. We were told that it would be a 35/40 min wait for a seat. They were bang on with that estimate. As we were steps away from returning to the restaurant, my phone rang with the all important message that there were a few open seats at the bar.

We (me and my gfriend), shared the arugula (with pear, cheese & walnut) salad for an appetizer. For a main we shared the salami pizza on a spelt crust. For desert, we shared the tiramisu and the chocolate gelato. Our total bill came to $42.94.

Some important notes about the meal itself:
- the salad was light and fresh and there was an adequate distribution of pear, walnut and cheese.
- the pizza is done in a traditional italian style (i.e. they do not put heaps of cheese on the crust like is done at Dominos or Pizza Hut). That being said, the pizza was not at all greasy, which can happen when too much cheese is provided. The pizza is sliced into four quarters, and is best eaten by rolling it up like a calzone. The crust is thin, and is definitely large enough for one person.
- the tiramisu is served in an unconventional manner. It appears in a little drinking glass with the cake on the bottom and the creamy part on top, making it difficult to get an even distribution of cake and cream in each bite.
- the chocolate gelato was excellent. No complaints.

The only other thing I would mention is the noise level. The restaurant is very popular, especially on Saturday night. As a result, it was quite noisy. Not a place to take your grandmother for a quiet conversation. ;-)

Oh, one last thing to mention. The service was excellent. Our water was refreshed many times, and our meal arrived very promptly. It was noted that there was a lot of staff on hand, which likely was the reason for the prompt service."}
{"text":"We're back on the HUNT for Toronto's BEST! Stop #6 of the pizza pie tour: Pizzeria Libretto

We stopped at the University Avenue Pizzeria Libretto for a pleasant afternoon lunch. The restaurant has beautiful, modern interior design with a nice spacious feel provided by the surrounding window walls. On top of that, the good amount of indoor and outdoor seating make this a choice setup for a restaurant.

We started the lunch with a Buttermilk Fried Calamari appetizer. Presentation wise the dish fits the bill for culinary art, with a tower of golden, crispy squid stacked atop a vibrant almond romesco sauce. The taste did not disappoint either, and not just because fried food equals better food by default. The romesco was stellar pairing.

When it came to the pizzas we got one of their most popular items, the Nduja pizza, and also got a little adventurous with the daily special. Both are red pizzas with thin crusts. The Nduja specifically has garlic, oregano, basil, mozzarella, stracciatella cheese, and nduja susage. The best part of this guy was without question the bold flavour of the Nduja sausage backed up by the mozzarella-stracciatella combo. For both pies the crusts were not particularly exceptional, but solid as far as crust goes.
Then came the day special. Excuse me for not recalling its name, but knowing the ingredients should be sufficient to order it if they have it. When it arrives on your table you'll get a pie with marinara, basil, mozzarella (I think), a respectable amount of salami, and maple syrup. Yes, maple syrup! I've got to say that though I enjoyed this pizza, throughout the meal I couldn't help repeating how confused I was with the pairing of sweet syrup, with the audacious salami flavour. It's like serving a steak with a layer of apple pie on top. Who knows, maybe it'll work, but... why? Half of me wants to order it again, and the other half is still recovering from the shock.

Noteably, I also had the Duck Confit pie on a seperate occasion, which is a white pie served with mozzarella, some meat that I don't remember, and bosc pear. You would think that pears on a pizza would also confuse me, but it was pretty boss and I wasn't mad at the choice at all.

I'd suggest Pizzeria Libretto to anyone. Great, (apparently authentic), Neapolitan pizza. Friendly service. Adventurous flavours. Cool space. Kojo seal of approval."}
{"text":"Long wait for this restaurant...1 hour ++ on a rainy Sunday evening. 
The calamari was good; crispy, crunchy and cooked just right. 
I got the Duck confit with bosce pear pizza; the duck was a little dry; noy my fave confit ever, the pear was good but there wasn't a lot of it. The crust was pretty good. Service was good and pizzas arrived fairly quickly for such a busy place. Overall, I'd give it a 3.5*. 
There's a similar concept in SF that pulls it off a little better...Tony's Napoletana in North Beach...proscuitto with fig...MmmMmMmm"}
{"text":"HAS ANYONE IN THIS CITY EVER EATEN A FUCKING PIZZA IN THEIR LIFE?????

I'm sorry but who gives a shit about their pizza, it's boring and bland. Regina's and Terroni both have better pizza, it's actually the rest of the food on this menu that makes Libretto worth going to. Meatballs are so good. Two stars because of the shitty service and the annoyingness of the seating."}
{"text":"I'm 100% Italian so believe me that this is the best pizza I ever had in Toronto (and outside of Italy, for now).
Even some \"cheap\" pizzerias in Italy are not this good LOL
High quality ingredients, authentic taste, all very good."}
{"text":"The nduja sausage pizza was very good....nice thin soft crust...

The tiramisu was okkk...the layer of bread was a little dry than expected....

The local mozzarella was ok as well...not really great... 

Will go there again for the sausage pizza..."}
{"text":"We went with a big group of about 20 people from the office. Of course, we had to make reservations for that and everything went very smoothly once we arrived there. 
The only requirement for having a big group like that at their location was to settle for a fixed menu which contained starters like bread with olive oil, salad and mozzarella, pizza margherita and a biscotti as desert. 
Overall the food was good, nothing to complain. The pizza dough was a bit soft which I don't like too much but that's obviously a personal preference. It was still a good pizza. 
They handled our group well and professionally compared to other places we had been before.

Even though I haven't had any of their other dishes I think it's definitely worth trying them out."}
{"text":"This joint like many in the hood is a positive and clear reminder of gentrification in action! No disrespect to the locals but we all know 15 years ago, saying that you were going to 'hang out' at Dufferin and Dundas 'for fun,' meant something quite different than what it means today... 

Also, Libretto is a clear reminder that most Torontonians have never had Italian pizza and trust me, Libretto ain't Italian. This is a place that really sells itself a bit more on its vibe and decour than for their pizza. Don't get me wrong, it does not make it a bad place to hang out with your friends, it just means they do not make great pizza. 

The truth is I have had better Margherita --the baseline all pizzerias should be rated on, since if you can not make this, then you have no business making more complicated dishes-- at a no-name corner joint in Rome than the pricier stuff I got at this locale.

Also, as it has been mentioned before by other Yelpers, \"burnt\" should not be an option when ordering a pizza. I do not know why they do it however the two times I have been here, my friend's pizzas have come out of the oven, not just sizzling but also with charcoaled chunks in the crust. Sure, at first I thought it was their attempt at trying to portray a 'rustic' take on their goods. Sure I can try to buy that but really, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and burnt is just burnt. 

Would I come back here again? Well, this place has gotten enough of a reputation that you could do worse taking, say a date somewhere else. It is always busy and the exposed brick can give it a somewhat romantic vibe and their menu has a few options for one to choose from, just don't come expecting amazing pizza though. 

Specially if you have had it in Italy.  
You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"The place had a nice vibe and atmosphere. It was pretty packed when we got there, we waited about 10 minutes for a seat for two, which isn't bad at all.
The waitress was really nice and welcoming, and she was on top of things. Even though it was pretty busy she paid attention to every table, when we were running out of water even before I could think of the thought of asking for more water she was already there with a new bottle.
I got the night feature, which at that night was the sausage and chili pizza.
Being completely honest, I almost threw up after taking the first bite, because the chili was sooooooo salty. I personally cannot handle salty foods that well, but if it's just a tad bit too salty I can deal with it and keep eating. But that literally hit me hard. I had to drink 2 cups of water cuz of that one bite. However I my friend seemed to like them, so I guess it's a preferential thing, but I am surprised anyone could tolerate that amount of saltiness.
All in all, the pizza was very nice, I liked the thin middle with a thicker crust.
Overall, it's not my cup of tea so I most likely will not come back here, but my friend definitelt fell in love with the place and he will be back for more. I would recommend pizza lovers to come try the place, definitely won't regret it."}
{"text":"I hate thin crust but this place does it quite well.
Libretto really does deserve better, but my personal taste buds can't give it anything above an \"a-ok\"

I had the sausage pizza- it was very well prepared, simple- not too much- just delicate.  
my dining partner got the sandwhich combo for his lunch - his description made it seem pedestrian.

Got the budino desert.  Gotta be on the top 10 list of all deserts of all time for me.  That being said, I would not come back for JUSt the dessert.

Had a double long espresso that was good but not an amazing espresso.

bill came up to 50ish for a filling lunch for 2 people.

I'm not likely to come back- the food was good but nothing I'll ever crave- 
I would, however, introduce friends to this place if they had never tried it before.

The room is VERY nice. the restaurant itself is cozy, and extremely well decorated to give the type of ambience i WANT to be in.  but again, the food isn't somehting I will ever, personally crave.

definitlely come to try but indifferent in coming back.

oh, and in terms of comparing it to Terroni.  I would say the food is slihgtly better at Terroni's but the service is 100% better at Libretto."}
{"text":"This is terrible...Toronto wake up....paying 20$ for a pizza....better be made of gold...."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick slice of cardboard covered covered in a tomato sauce with some topping, this isn't the place to go, 

We were a party of four. The location is hidden but not impossible to find. I had a little trouble deciphering the Italian menu, however, our server did a marvelous job of explaining it to me. 

My wife asked for something that wasn't on the menu. Most places would have simply said no to make their job easier. Our server said he'll see what he can do, and then came back with her request. 

We each had a different pizza. The food was wonderful. The server and other staff took a genuine interest in making sure we had an excellent experience. 

I don't know how the other locations hole up to this restaurant, but I was very impressed with the meal and service. The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pizzeria!
You can feel they love what they are doing, if you love pizza, you have to try it!
Better make a reservation.
Parking lot is near by, on Dundas st green p parking lot."}
{"text":"VPN certification ... very good!  Great tasty pizza and friendly service.  Just wish the arancini can be as tasty as the ones I had at Syracuse, Sicily."}
{"text":"Ambiance:
Chill, relaxed, refined. Red and moody tones. Comfortable. Unpretentious.

Food:
Ordered the buttermilk calamari, duck and pear pizza and the special pizza of the day with prosciutto, mushroom and truffle. Oh my the truffle pizza was soo good as was the calamari. Definitely a must eat again for me!

Service:
Great service in terms of attitude. I think it was getting busier and they forgot our calamari order but they were so pleasant about it and resolved it right away that I didn't mind. We also got a second plate of bread without asking for it.. That was devoured in minutes!

Overall Verdict:
I'll definitely be back. I enjoyed the drinks, the food and I didn't order dessert - so I gotta go back to make up for it. We were so full that dessert was the last thing on our mind... But we won't make the same mistake next time :) Pizza Libretto is a must go if you haven't been yet, or haven't been in awhile. I wouldn't mind trying out the other locations for a different ambiance but with the same great food!"}
{"text":"AWESOME Pizza.

Don't be fooled by the facade of uninspiring decor. Especially in the financial district, I anticipated what granite countertops and polished service always suggests - a hefty tag for a humdrum meal. Not here! This is where your average iBanker can actually get a good return on his investment.

I recommend you order the pizza - they know what they're doing.."}
{"text":"I like pizza, I like bagels, I like hot dogs, with mustard and beer...but I REALLY like their pizza! - 4.5/5

This place was recommended by the sales manager (he's Italian) at my workplace; one day he asked me what kind of cuisines my boyfriend and I like to eat, I said lots of Asian, Indian and Italian. He suggested this place, told me \"If you want real Italian food like you were in Italy, you guys should eat here\" and we did! It has become one of our go-to restaurants for fancy Italian cuisine (fancy pizza). The restaurant is pretty clean, the seating is comfortable whether you're situated in a booth or open table and the wait staff are pretty friendly. They have four locations (Ossington, Danforth, University and King), my boyfriend and I usually go to the University location since it's the closest one to us. I recommend making a reservation for dinner time because they're quite busy, but if you walk in before dinner time rush, you're good!

Presentation: Clean and tidy plates, restaurant does not smell like food, spacious seat area (computerized seat system)

Pros: Taste is consistent, portions are really big (1 pizza can fill two people) and the wait staff refills empty glasses regardless of whatever beverage you chose (we always go for tap water because neither of us like sparkling water, it's WEIRD =|)

Cons: An order can take about 10-20 minutes depending on what you want to eat, there are no pictures on their menus but you will not be disappointed when the order arrives at your table and they take away the dipping sauce for your complimentary bread so if you love the dip like I do, hide it!

Fave Eats: They always start you off with some delicious bread and dip on the side (the dip is to die for), when they take the dip away, I get sad; Flat Iron Steak Spiedini (beef skewers), a bit spicy, chunky pieces and full of flavour!; House-made sausage pizza, the caramelized onions gives a sweetness to it and I like that!; Nduja sausage pizza, a little bit of heat and delicious! and Duck Confit pizza, my boyfriend ordered it once and it was amazing!

Price: Decent, after all, they have more than just pizza on their menu!

Seconds: YES PLEASE! =D"}
{"text":"This isn't one I really need to weigh in on... Pizza Libretto's excellence is well documented and widely known. Their food is consistently delicious and the service is quick, professional and friendly. I've tried a number of their vegetarian starters and I've never been disappointed. It's clear they use fresh, high quality ingredients and know how to season and dress things properly. For my main, I always get a vegetarian quattro stagioni pizza, topped with artichokes, roasted red peppers, wonderfully briny green olives, and a mix of mushrooms. My favourite pizza in town."}
{"text":"Went here on my last day in Toronto. The food here is great. It taste like the pizza in Italy. You are given bread in the beginning. OMG the bread is so soft and good.  My kids and I ordered margherita pizzas. They got the kids version will comes with gelato at the end."}
{"text":"The service was great and were very informative. Food is fresh and tasty. The pizza is pretty good too. Had the lunch special - two choices of app, entr√©e, and dessert. I had the Caprese Salad (colourful and fresh), the Margherita Pizza (Yummy), and the Chocolate Gelato (tastes homemade fresh)."}
{"text":"Came here last night after reading all of the great reviews.

I ordered the salami pizza, which was pretty good.  I think the crust is where the pizza really excels.  The thin crust had a nice chewy texture.

While the ingredients were pretty good, I found my pizza had too many blank spots.  I didn't like getting bites of just dough and pizza sauce.

The restaurant itself is of high quality.  The patio was perfect for a nice summer night!  They also supply you with chili oil for your pizza and really good bread with oil for dipping.

Service was very friendly but slow.  The restaurant and patio were pretty busy but I thought there wasn't enough staff to accommodate the number of customers.

Overall, I enjoyed a nice relaxing dinner with friends on a patio on a warm summer night.  The pizza didn't wow me and the service was still slow at 10pm on a Friday night.  Because of this, I doubt I'd be coming back with so many other options downtown."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Italy, but they claim it's \"authentic\" and they're certified based on a bunch of fancy smancy standards - well, all I can say is it's different from your regular pizza, and pretty darn good.

If you're a fan of Indian naan (I am) then you'll *love* this pizza. It's a soft, naan like crust that's toasted perfectly and the toppings are great.

Home made sausage, duck confit, mmmm... I wish there was more sausage though, I swear our pizza only had like 5 pieces of sausage on it.  It was basically a margherita :(

The duck confit pizza had plenty of duck, no complaints there. 

All in all, a great place to have a Pizza, will be back if I'm craving a pie in that area.

Pizzas run $12-15 I think."}
{"text":"I ate at Pizzeria Libretto on the Danforth years ago, before my Yelp days, and wasn't a fan of the pizza (crust was too burnt) so avoided the restaurant after that. But I came today because it was a friend's birthday lunch, and figured it was time I give this resto another shot.

It was actually pretty good! My pizza was less burnt this time, although there were still parts of the crust that I had to chop off. But the marinara sauce was actually really nice, as was the house made chili oil. 

I got the lunch prix fixe ($15) - arugula salad, margarheta pizza, and espresso cinnamon gelato. The arugula salad was delightful. One of the better salads I've had in a while. I think the reason I liked it so much was because it wasn't soaked in the vinaigrette. Instead, it was lightly dressed, which allowed the pear, walnuts and cheese to bring the flavour to the dish. The espresso cinnamon gelato was awesome too - neat flavour combination. 

I think this resto would be a go-to for me if I liked the pizzas more. $15 prix fixe is a good deal, and the location and ambience in the resto are great."}
{"text":"I had the most basic pizza--the margherita, I believe--and it was amazing. I can't think of a single place that has better pizza than this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good with ok prices. However its slightly  over rated. Plus its a hit and miss depnding on what you order. It can be busy at times but good service."}
{"text":"My hats go off to this restaurant. My family and I went here to eat after a Blue Jays game and the inside of the place was quite nice. The waiters were all very professional and nice. We ordered some drinks and pizza and were enjoying it until a kid that was with her family there went up to the fire alarm and pulled it for no reason... SO the alarm was going off and it was extremely annoying but it was not the restaurants fault at all. We eventually moved out to the patio as the ringing was very annoying while the waiters were scrambling to figure out how to turn it off as well as the firefighters. BUT here's where my hat goes off to this place and the people working there. They felt so bad that they not only gave us all a free round of drink, but they also gave us our first round of drinks for free as well, making us pay for only the pizzas. The pizza was fantastic, the people were very nice and accommodating and it was a great place. Extremely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"A very classic neapolitan. Simple, not fancy, made out of very good ingrediences (5/5). The only certificated in canada. The good thing about the certification is that the differences are not to high all over the world so you cant actually get a bad pizza if its certificated and you like neapolitan style. The Panna Cotta is one of the best panna cottas i ever had (5/5).

- I only rate the food not the atmosphere or the place in general."}
{"text":"Great spot for casual dinner in king west without the dreaded patio lineup! This location is just as good as ossington. Had the red pizza with sausage and basil and will definitely be back for more! The calamari is also to die for. I saw people doing takeout here as well which can be really convenient for dinner on the go!"}
{"text":"In the Toronto Yelp community we have an ongoing Unofficial Yelp Event called Perfect Pizza Quest and this was the 7th iteration.  I was asked earlier if this is in fact an actual search for perfect pizza or if this was just an event.  I had answered that it's an event but knowing there's no such thing (as perfect pizza), the search will never stop and (the event) it will never end.  This was my first attempt at organizing the PPQ and we had a decent turn out of almost 20 people.  To get that many people into a restaurant in the downtown core on a Friday is a challenge but Pizzeria Libretto was more than helpful.

Yes they take reservations.  That is a huge deal considering I had large group (almost 20) coming on a Friday evening.  Mind you the maximum they would allow for a single reservation was 10 so I had actually asked 2 more people to make reservations but it ended up we didn't need more 20.  You can make reservations on line through Open Table or I did through the Yelp app but making an online reservation only allowed a maximum of 2 patrons per reservation.  

I did of course have to end up calling them and speak to a person there.  There was no guarantee that we'd get seating together but I did intimate that we were a large party together and that the secondary reservation that I had asked somebody else to make well in advance, they did their best to seat us together and it ended up we were two long tables side by side in our own sort of area by the back near the ovens.

The location works out well, being in the core and basically just a couple hundred feet away from St. Andrew subway station, it's easy to get to this restaurant at the north east corner of University and Pearl.

A few of us were there for before 7pm and we were promptly seated as more and more of the party showed up.  They have a modest collection of beers to choose some and some wine to select from.  

Our server took to the time to explain how their pizza is served and what we would expect.  Libretto is a certified VPN establishment as well as DOP certified.  Our server went on to say how the pizza is served and how the crust is thin, slightly charred on the outer and more moist on the inner parts.  For some of us this was a given since we've had authentic Neapolitan pizza before but it's a good way to explain to the patrons who aren't familiar with Neapolitan style pizza and are probably used to something else.

I had started with the calamari because my Yelp friend Darrin C told me it's amazing.  I have to say anything he says I will get now since he basically got me to try Korean fried chicken.  The calamari I have to say was just OK.  I wasn't so blown away by it and it wasn't because expectations were high.  The real deciding factor of how well Pizzeria Libretto was going to do with their pizza.  

I had ordered the duck confit pizza and my wife had ordered the funghi. I had asked our server if the Meal Share program was only for the duck confit and she said for now it is but that they will rotate the Meal Share menu item around so it would be something different in the future.  For those that do not know or not aware Meal Share is a charitable organization that promotes restaurants to donate meals to their program.  The way it works is that if you order a Meal Share item on the menu, the restaurant will donate a meal.  

The pizza was as I had expected but I loved the taste of the duck.  I had a slice of my wife's mushroom pizza and it was great.  I was sort of surprised that they actually sliced the pizza.  Some Neapolitan places don't slice it but I didn't mind that is was sliced.  I would have ended up slicing it myself if they hadn't.  

Overall I was very pleased between the reservations, professionalism, service, food and organization and accommodation.  One of our group accidentally spilled a beer all over the table and floor and not only did they come over to help us clean up but they also took it off the bill.  For having about 2 tables of 10 we were all given individuals bills and those that wanted to combine were combined when asked and they did not impose an auto-gratuity either.

On top of all of this as far as authentic Neapolitan pizza goes it's one of the better ones I've had and their pricing is not ridiculous either."}

-----

Decent Pizza, but not sure it lives up to the hype.  Had the duck confit which was a bit salty but good, and the best way for me to describe the crust was like it was naan.

We also had the charcuterie platter which was nice but again, nothing outlandishly special.  The sausage from the Black Hoof was good.  Actually couldn't complain about any of it.  

They hinted that they normally wouldn't let me sit until my guest arrived, who happened to be 10 minutes late.  I kept getting from the waiter.. Is she here yet?  Is she here yet?  Is she here yet?  I could understand if the place was packed like it normally is, but at 5:30 pm it wasn't half full.

{"text":"Libertto has enough reviews so I own't really bother.

Good, not great pizza, very trendy and the people there act like it.  Definitely worth checking out, but not worth waiting in line for again."}
{"text":"You know something is good when the essence of what makes it so good (the crust, in this case), does not yet have an adjective to properly describe it in English."}
{"text":"The lunch special is I unbeatable! Every time I meet someone for lunch I try to go to pizza libretto! For $16 you get an app, pizza, and dessert and for $5 more you can get a drink!

I ordered the beet salad ( out of this world delicious!), the Margherita ( my favourite pizza), and the pudding dessert ( can't remember what it was called but I am so thankful our Server told us to order it). Food is delicious, service is always awesome, friendly and casual and it's always a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I ate at when I moved to the city and, several years later, it's still probably my favourite food in Toronto. Read all the other 5 star reviews for details. 

In brief: Best pizza I've ever had (duck confit pizza! best margherita anywhere!), great wine list, amazing atmosphere, excellent service, brilliant charcuterie and cheese plates, amazing desserts, and great prices. 

Serious fans of Neapolitan pizza will be eternally satisfied with these pies. May this place never close."}
{"text":"Probably the best Margarita pizza in the city! Great service and atmosphere. A bit busy at lunch but you'd expect that in the financial district."}
{"text":"I love the little individual thin crust pizza's here, but I hate the crowds and service on Friday's and Saturday's after 6pm.  I'm not sure about how busy they are at any other time.  For me, it's not worth driving out to Ossington Ave from Lakeshore and Bathurst when you get in the mood for their pizza with the uncertainty of how it will all play out.

This is the advice I got, but won't take:  Go earlier than you are plan to eat (about an hour or so), and to get your name on the waiting list. Then go over to Salt or one of the pubs in the area order a drink and relax. Libretto's will call your cell as soon as your table is ready. 

Really?!  That sounds like a plan if you want to squander your money and productive hours away doing something you can do for free at home, all the while waiting to eat pizza.  I live in Toronto, not New York.  New Yorker's indulge in this weekend past time all the time, and think nothing of blowing $300 on food a drinks before making it to the club to blow another $300 on drinks.  I've been there, and done that...so no thanks."}
{"text":"This is the original Libretto located near the south east corner of Dundas and Ossington.  This one is a bit different from the other locations I've been to and would be now the 3rd out of 4 locations I've been to.  I've only not been to the one on the Danforth at this point.  The main difference would be dining here.  They don't take reservations at this the original location while at the other locations they do.  We were a party of 5 at around 1230pm on a Monday and were able to get what seemed to be the only 6 seat table at the very back by the kitchen.  It seemed to be a marble top oval shaped table, unique when all the others were your basic rectangular tables.  We were pretty much seated immediately.

It seems Mondays in Toronto are common for many businesses to be closed since they're open all weekend, Mondays would be common to being closed to many places that are not open 7 days a week.  Thankfully Libretto is open and not taking reservations, I figured Monday would be a safe bet to get a table for 5 as opposed to a lunch or dinner on a weekend.  While the place didn't seem packed when we were arrived as our meal progressed into the early afternoon the place seemed to eventually get full.

While they have quite the selection of local craft beers, my friend was looking for a Moretti which they didn't have and the only Italian beer they had was bottled Peroni.  Since I was familiar with the menu at Libretto being at the King street and University locations numerous times each I already had an idea of what I wanted to get as well as for the appetizers.  To start they give complimentary bread with an oil and balsamic dip.  I had asked for the carpaccio topped with arugula, 5 arancini balls (default order is 3) as well as the words calamari weren't coming out of my mouth so I made the gesture of a \"pyramid\" with my hands and our server knew I meant the calamari.  

Typically, in the other locations in the past the calamari is basically a pyramid of fried squid.  My wife had also ordered the Rocco salad which she usually has whenever she goes for lunch on the Danforth.  I noticed this time around the pyramid seemed a bit \"flatter\" than previous experiences.  It didn't seem to have the verticalness to it.  The carpaccio was great as usual.  Shaved Padano tops the thin slices of meat while the arancini are always a classic.

Our friends had asked for the marguerita, and another had ordered the cremini which she'd share while I went with the good old diavolo and my wife went with a new one she's not had before which was the kale pizza.  One thing for me that always stands out for Libretto is that the service is really great.  The staff are always friendly and I've never had any issues at any of the locations in fact it's the complete opposite.  I find their service to be better than great there's nothing that they wouldn't do and it's always attentive and fast.

It should go without having to say but Libretto has 4 of the 5 restaurants in Toronto that are certified Neapolitan (VPN or Vera  Pizza Napoletana - Americas).  They proudly display their sign above their store front.  What this means is that the association that oversees the standards for what can be considered authtentic Neapolitan pizza has essentially approved Libretto for the methods, ingredients and process for making what can officially be considered Neapolitan pizza.  For those that don't know yes, the pizza is cooked a very particular way to meet the requirements of making their pizza in the authentic way.  The pizza that Libretto makes is from what I've been told as close to what you'd get in Napoli as you can get in the city because of it.  Yes, the inventors of pizza approve this place.

I have never been once disappointed by any of my visits to any of the Librettos and now I can say I've finally been to the original on the Ossington strip.  It may have taken a while but after visiting the other locations it's safe to say that their standards are what they are and what they serve is basically good across the board.  I'm sure if I went to the Danforth location it would probably be the same as the other 3, great."}
{"text":"The word libretto refers to a notebook.  I wonder if Italians have the same strange ways of picking names that do not translate well into English like Chinese Restaurants?  Usually the Chinese name and the English name don't even mean the same thing!  If you're looking for a place to have a group function or reservation of any type, Pizzeria Libretto doesn't allow you to book a table...How ironic?!

I walked to the restaurant from work as I was meeting Tony F. at 5PM.  It seems he's always the one that takes me to places that every Yelp Elite ought to have been to to be deemed Elite.  First Guu Izakaya now Pizzeria Libretto!  Thanks for helping me earn my stars!   I ended up arriving 15 minutes late, and I learned that the wait staff almost gave away our table!  Are they really that busy?!  

I ordered a glass of their 2009 Dolomite Riesling and found it to be a bit on the dry side.  It wasn't as sweet as other Rieslings I've had and preferred in the past.  Tony ordered a Bellini (what a wimp! jks) which was made with Prosecco and freshly crushed peaches with a slice of orange.  He seemed to enjoy it. 

Shortly after placing our order, a bread plate was brought.  The bread was quite delicious in the chili-oil-balsamic-virgin-oil dip that they had.  The bread wasn't the freshest, and I've definitely had better - but I've also had worse.  

To start we ordered the Salumi Tasting which is a charcuterie board with all their cured meats and some pickled condiments.  It came with an Ontario Prosciutto, House Cured Duck, Cured Beef, and the Black Hoof's Andouilla (pork based).  The condiments consisted of: freshly sliced peaches, cantaloupe, gherkins and pickled leeks.  The prosciutto was the mildest of all the cured meats, and my favourite had to have been the Black Hoof's Andouilla.  It had a bit of a spicy kick to it, but you could tell it was freshly cured as it was not \"dry or hard\" like most cured meats tend to be.  The server suggested that the Andouilla was best accompanied by the pickled leeks.  Great suggestion!  The peaches were not the freshest as I saw signs of bruising in the actual flesh as I was consuming it.  Be warned that you will be extremely thirsty after consuming this charcuterie platter as all cured meats are rather high in sodium.  I know after my meal I was dying for some H20!

I also wanted to order a salad to get some veggies in me.  I asked the server for his recommendation and he suggested the Caprese Salad.  The only veggie that was in this salad were the Ontario heirloom tomatoes, and it was served with a mozzarella cheese and drizzled in olive oil.  The salad was quite fresh.  Although the ingredients were simple, the dish was not what I would call bland - perhaps mild is the way I would describe it?  The ingredient that really stood out in this \"salad\" was definitely the tomato.  

I was originally going to opt for their prix fixe menu which is a 4-course meal including your choice of pizza from their menu.  I guess I won't know how big the pizza portion from the prix fixe would've been, but the regular portions were enough to stuff the 2 of us!  We ordered the Duck Confit pizza to share which was topped with Bosc pears and mozzarella cheese.  The dough is what stands out the most, at least in my mind, about the pizzas at Libretto.  It was a thin, naan-like crust that was not at all oily or greasy like the one's you'd find at Pizza Hut.  The pizza itself was not, as a whole, the tastiest pizza I've had.  The mozzarella was rather bland, and the duck was a bit on the dry side and not heavy in flavour to compensate for the 2 \"mild\" ingredients that were the ingredients in the pizza.  With that said, duck confit is a heavier choice of protein, and we definitely left feeling stuffed.  So stuffed, that we didn't have room for dessert!

Verdict:

The bill, before taxes and tip rang up to about $77.  The charcuterie board rang in at $24, and the pizza at $17 - just to give you an idea as to price points.  It definitely wasn't the best $77 I spent, and the pizza here is definitely not the best I've had - but I will add that Libretto does make unique pizzas (e.g. you can't just walk into any pizza joint and get a duck confit pizza).  The service, other than the no reservations policy, and the \"if she doesn't arrive in another 5 minutes you're going to have to give up your table\" spiel - was quite good.  Our water glasses were always topped up for us when they reached low.  I would probably come back to Libretto if I was in the area, but it would definitely not warrant me driving down just to visit."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. Prices are reasonable.  The calamari starter is worth the visit alone--the calamari was melt in your mouth fresh and and the red pepper almond sauce went perfectly with it.  We ordered a white pizza with sausage.  The crust was excellent very thin but had the right amount of chew.  Toppings were not overly abundant but enough to impart good flavor to the pizza.  The sausage was well seasoned but not greasy.  We noticed many diners having the lunch prix fixed menu and it appeared to be a very good deal with a starter, pizza and dessert for $15.00. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! Has that smokey flavor that you get only when made in a stone oven with wood chips. We had the daily special which was a spicy salami with maple pizza. The pizza was extra thin crust and cut into four pieces. The center was thin and juicy and sides were crispy and chewy. We also had a side of the flank steak skewers that were quite good, but the bread that was part of the skewer was a bit burnt.
Overall the flavors were nice and definitely worth returning for a second visit."}
{"text":"Visited Wed June 14 for lunch. 
Pizza is my second favourite food after sushi. I have been to Pizzeria Libretto several times, this was my first time at this location. A bit pricy for a lunch option, the place was about 1/2 full on a bright sunny day. 

Pros
Quick and attentive lunch service.
We both ordered the prixe fix lunch menu. Ordered the margherita and the marinara pizza which were both fresh and tasty. Having 4 slices of pizza, plus a salad and dessert may be a little bit too much for most girls to finish. 
There were able to make an iced coffee which wasn't listed on the menu. 
Arugula salad is quite large compared to the caprese salad. 

Cons
A few steps down to the restaurant, not wheelchair accessible. 
Prixe fixe really limited, to only 2 pizza both of which had no meat on them. The pizza's looked kind of bare, changing to a different pizza is  an additional $5 which didn't sound appealing to me. 
No non-alcoholic beer available which is my preferred beverage. 
Surcharge for one of the flavours of gelato, well that sucks having to pay extra for a certain flavour. A prixe fixe should be all-inclusive. 


Damage - $48 after tax before tip."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza with thin crust, made just right. The Restaurant Decor and Vibe was pleasant. Vanessa's Service was Excellent."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here and loving it every time. The pizza is delicious - we always get the special. The calamari is super yummy however pretty fattening all fried up like onion rings. The service has always been good - perhaps could refill the water bottle more often but that's a small thing. The food is good and I like the ambiance of this neighborhood pizza place. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was great, wine was reasonably priced and the severs were friendly.  A fun place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Libretto on University and Pearl and my wife has been to the location on the Danforth but this location besides the original on Ossington is the one neither of us have been to.  I was told it just recently opened a couple months back and as far as parking it's probably more friendly that the one on University and it's closer than the Danforth.  The original on Ossington I wan't sure if they took reservations or not so I was OK with booking with the King street location on the day of about 5 hours in advance.  I was lucky to be able to get a table for 530pm.

The address is 545 King West but the entrance to this restaurant is at the side of the building down a well lit alley on the west side.  There's a sign \"Pizzeria Libretto\" right at the north west corner of the building and the entrance is a red awning covered door.

The space compared to the University Ave location has less natural lighting being that it's at the side of a building and the internal lighting has what can only be described as individual desk lamps at each table.  The decor is simple yet it has the feeling of a older building which is what it is with an exposed slatted wood ceiling.

The service and hospitality is still top notch and our server, Justin seemed like he couldn't do enough for us.  We were asked if everything was fine, our drinks were being looked after and it truly felt we were getting a healthy dose of attention.  

Much like our previous visits to Libretto the food as well as the service was excellent.  We started off with the arancini which is a serving of 3, a plate of prosciutto di Parma and an order of the buttermilk calamari.  All 3 appetizers were great.  The arancini comes with a marinara and parsley sauce and the flavors mix so well.  The balls themselves are a nice size and cooked properly.  The prosciutto came with oiled and dressed flat bread sticks (grissini) and the calamari is served in a pyramid shape on top of a pepper and almond sauce which is very different.

I ordered the nduja pizza and my wife had the cremini (mushroom) which is a white pizza without tomato sauce.  Both pizzas were great.  I can't remember if they cut the pizza last time or not as some places that are certified VPN don't cut the pizza but either way it makes for easier eating.  I can't say if I've had authentic nduja before or not (my friend from Long Island would know for sure) but this sausage was very flavorful and spicy.  I really enjoyed the bite this meat had but I can't say it's for everybody like my wife wouldn't like it because for her it would probably be too hot.  For me it was great, I even added some of the spiced olive oil.

The cremini was very rich and is drier than nduja because it doesn't have sauce on it.  My wife ordered it with blue cheese on it as well as it was offered and it had a strong flavor to it because of the strong cheese.  

The food as well as the service at Libretto are both wonderful.  They only have pizza as main dishes and there is no pasta but they do have a good variety of small plates, salads and other starters to compliment their pizzas.

Libretto is now my new favorite authentic Neapolitan place, more so than Pizza e Pazzi now.  This new location on King just east of Portland is somewhat hidden but a great new location."}
{"text":"A worthy long wait, the pizzas are traditional, thin, and piping hot!

The wait was predicted at 45 minutes, we went next door to grab a drink, to our surprise, they called us with a ready table in 15 or less!  We were prepared to wait....

For starters, we tried the SPICY MEATBALLS, and they were full of flavor and delicious, small and bite size, they were great fir sharing and saving the dipping sauce for later...

The main attraction: pizzas.  We shared a cream-based CREMINI MUSHROOM PIZZA, which was pungent in fungi and brought out by the Gorgonzola cheese.  It was an acquired taste in which I enjoyed greatly but my company did not.  Not your typical cheesy tomato pizza, it was rich in flavor and worked quite well if you like a rich mushroom taste.

The next pizza, we sprung for a more traditional pizza which was tomato-based and highly recommended by our lovely waitress, the  NDUJA SAUSAGE.  This was a great spin on the more traditional Margherita Pizza.  It had a spicy and flavorful sausage, which was soft, almost spreadable.  The basil and other ingredients were delicious and brought out the sweet tomato and sausage.  It was great and I can see why this was a clear favorite amongst the crowd.  

Both the pizzas were thin and crispy, clearly made traditionally in a wood oven in 90 seconds, blazed in heat over 900 degrees, wow.  It brings me back to eating really traditional pizza in Italy, wood oven and all.  The service is amazing, our lovely waitress was informative and eager to please, she wasn't there to \"serve\" us,bur more so to make sure our experience was the best.

I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good quality pizza, it feels wholesome and totally takes a different spin on pizza night!"}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto offers beautiful neapolitan pizza and other small italian bites in a lively, raucuous atmosphere. I stopped in here one weekend night to find the place packed to the gills with all sorts of hungry diners The decor is hip and modern enough what with the drop lights, exposed brick, communal tables all lending an urban chic to the joint. Props to the wide selection of reasonably priced glasses of wine-albeit all italian but hey when in rome.....

I had the Marg which was pillowy soft and chewy, topped with a simple tomato sauce, a few basil leaves and freshy creamy mozzerella. Good char on the upskirt as well. Better pizza than Terroni's and I was surprised to find better service here on my weeknight visit than my last visit to the Terroni's on Adelaide. The hostess here deftly accomodated my table and others, my water glass was always filled and my server was able to offer a few comments on the wine selection. Other parts of the menu look interesting as well with the choices of cured meats, seasonal specials and some of the other pizza selections on the menu warrant future visits."}
{"text":"After much deliberation, I took an uber over here and I was very glad I did. I'm not from Toronto but the area looked pretty cool with tons of bars and eateries. I was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at the edge of the bar. It was a little annoying that all the staff had to go through by me to get to/from the bar but it wasn't too bad. I got a lot of attention from the servers so no complaints. They also didn't quite have any wine or cider that was sweet enough for me but at least the bartender was knowledgeable about their offerings. I ordered the calamari and the margarita pizza with extra cheese. Both were great, as was the complimentary bread and dipping oil. Calamari was crispy and came as a stacked pyramid with a ton of sauce on the bottom. Reminded me of vodka sauce but I wasn't sure if it was. The pizza had a ton of high quality cheese and a good amount of sauce and was topped with olive oil and a few basil leaves. The dough was thin yet very fluffy and had that nice distinct hint of oven char. I had so much leftover food I couldn't eat because I was so full. Edited to post picture."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this location does not have as high reviews as its two counterparts in ossington and greektown. Personally I felt the ambiance of this location to be more upscale and less crowded. 

I got the nduja sausage pizza for lunch, and was not disappointed. What I really enjoyed (and quite possibly would go back for) was the chocolate affogato - chocolate ice cream with hot espresso poured on top. The blend of a caffeine and sugar high was just what I needed after indulging in an entire pizza!"}
{"text":"Stopped in an hour before closing one evening and sat at the bar. Place was quiet and my pizza came out quite quickly. Pizza was perfectly cooked and the oil they offer as a condiment was good with it. Happy with the price of the pizza which was 17 bucks and the service which was quick and friendly. I can see it being a very loud room with the restaurant full of people sitting quite closely together."}
{"text":"Oh, the Mecca of pizza of the 416. 
Such yummy pizza, so yummy that one would consider offering a dowry so such pizza could join your family. Sadly, said pizza will never make it into your intricate family ties as I will CONSUME IT BEFORE IT COMES TO YOUR DOOR.
First off - Gusto 101, Gross. Now that we are here you are proved that you are a step ahead in your life enjoyment of pizza and overall pleasure in life. Good- you are a sensible being.
DO NOT GET THE ARANCINI IF THEY SOAK IT IN THAT SAC RELIGIOUS FISH SAUCE!! + the ricotta gnocci in the tomato sauce is not as good as it was before CHANGE PLS!!!!
Even though the Ossington location has misinterpreted my take out order countless times due to their hearing which is fogged over by excess mozzarella in the ears, I still return for yummy, naan like pies.
1. The lunch deal (if you don't know of this please educate yourself)
2. The margherita pizza
3. The libretto margherita pizza
4. The cremini pizza
5. The duck confit pizza
6. Change the ricotta gnocci back to the white sauce version pls- thanks."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch. We had the lunch prix fixe for $16. The lunch prix fixe came with a caprese salad, margherita pizza and gelato. Great value. There aren't many places where you can get a three course meal for $16.  Moreover, they usually have daily drink specials. 

The service was quick and efficient. The atmosphere was modern. The food was well prepared. The ingredients were fresh.  Apparently, Pizzeria Libretto meets the VPN's (Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana) strict requirements of the art of Neapolitan pizza making. They have been granted the designation by the VPN which our wait staff shared with us.  

For the price and the quality of the food, you cannot go wrong here. Its a great pizza place - plain and simple."}
{"text":"The reviews seem to have been written in the same style. We went last night for pizza. The aroma was inviting, the dough was limp and while burnt, almost to a crisp on the outside, it was not fully cooked on top. Disappointed after reading the hype."}
{"text":"I've been to this location and another multiple times and Pizzeria Libretto always does pizza right!! My standouts have been the duck confit pizza and the one with the prosciutto scattered on top! So perfectly cooked and the service is always great! Love this establishment and will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"This is a new location but as many of you know there are a couple of other locations in Toronto. The staff was super friendly and the food was simple and fresh. The highlight of dinner was probably the Rocco salad which came with arugula, beets, prosciutto and a flash fried soft egg on top. The Italian sausage and margarita pizza had a nice thin and chewy texture but weren't life changing given the price - $15-$20."}
{"text":"Having tried a sample version of their Margherita pizza at a beer event, I decided to finally try the restaurant. We came here on a Sunday afternoon for an early dinner before a Raptors game but made reservations as we didn't know what the crowd would be like. The restaurant is located just a block north from St. Andrew station on University. As soon as we walked in we were seated immediately. The restaurant was nicely decorated with a casual upbeat atmosphere with mostly booths and smaller tables. You could see the chefs baking the pizza in the wood oven stoves at the back of the restaurant. Our server immediately greeted us and since it was our first time, we asked what was recommended. All pizzas come in one size (personal size) but can be easily shared with others if you order a few pizzas. We opted for the feature (hawaiian pizza), duck confit pizza (my fave!), homemade sausage pizza, and salami with arugula pizza. All of which were cooked to perfection, it was nicely baked with a bit of browning at the top of crust to give you that rustic Neapolitan taste. Each pizza tasted unique and had so much flavour! We also ordered the calamari as recommended by a fellow yelper and it was pretty good, it came with a pesto and sweet potato sauce of some sort...very interesting! Overall, service and ambience were great but the food was even better."}
{"text":"We came here on a mission. To find the perfect pizza. Yes it's the infamous Quest for perfect pizza UYE. Turnout was great.

This place serves Neapolitan pizza. Its not your basic pizza. You won't find your basic toppings like pepperoni or chicken BBQ or meat lover...etc.

They take authenticity very seriously. If I had to describe this chain in one word it would be \"strict\". Pizza comes in one size and one size only, 12 inch. Apparently it's \"illegal\" to serve any other size. They got plenty of strict rules regarding their toppings too. Crust is very thin, resembles naan. Toppings are fresh. Overall tasty pizza, slightly pricy for 12 inch.

Such cultured, much authentic, very enriched, wow! Surely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Cute spot. Nice/large portion size. I had the duck confit pizza -- being a huge duck fan however, despite the great reviews I was a little disappointed. I thought the pizza was very salty and the combo just didn't satisfy me. My partner in crime had the nduja sausage and loved it - and it looked soooo good. Would definitely try this hot spot again but would make a different pizza selection."}
{"text":"After a long day of bird-hunting and photo-adventuring in the Mt Pleasant Cemetary and the surrounding area of the city, after a long criss cross of buses and streetcars, the boyfriend suggested we hit up Libretto for dinner as he'd been aching to try it for a crazy long time.

I hesitated at first, as we were definitely in the adventurer getup (i.e jeans and hoodies, camera bags and mittens!) but the smell once we were inside the lobby was too good to shy away from.

As it was 6:45, obviously there were no tables, BUT they had space at the window bar stools which turned out to be an awesome place to be. Puppies, cute boots, sunsets and pedestrian drama entertained us as we nibbled on our appetizers and salad.

The grub - as the boyfriend wanted the House Made Sausage pizza and a starter anyway he settled on the Prix Fixe ($25) for dinner which comes with an antipasti to start (gorgonzola, walnut on endive!!) any pizza, a salad (asiago arugula and walnuts, oh my gosh) and dessert. 

In addition to which (since a 10k walk made me quite hungry!) I asked for a Margherita (classic Neopolitan pizza, really) and a glass of the Piedirosso which the server recommended for the simplicity of the Margherita but I discovered (As I took a slice of the sausage pizza) was not very friendly with heavy meats. 

Dessert was a savoury and light Lemon Panna Cotta, actually we asked the server to surprise us and he smiled and came back with this gorgeous looking number that had crushed pistachio and icing sugar on it. Yum!!

The staff was really attentive and had us in and out with all our orders in a timely fashion so we didn't feel rushed or as if we had waited long. I would definitely return and highly advise the lunch prix fix which I believe is $15 which is a steal and a half for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I've eaten here and the Danforth location, but have the exact same food so if you are tired of the line-ups by the alternate location, both are wonderful.

The pizza is so thin you eat it with a fork and knife but its some of the best I've ever had. Don't try comparing it to your average take-out-a-slice-hole-in-the-wall because it's a different animal entirely - respect each place for what it does well."}
{"text":"Oh man the duck confit pizza is to die for.  Love this place.  Been here many times and each visit is better than the last."}
{"text":"Their calamari would be considered their signature dish (IMO). However, the pizza are now a disappointment from yesteryear. They were once not as soggy. Their consistency of both quantity and quality has not diminished. I would prefer to see a less soggy pizza on my next visit. Perhaps I'll request it well done. Hopefully this solves the problem."}
{"text":"Such a cool little vibe at this place, went on a Friday night for some pizza and wine on a date. Loved the interior of the place, the pizza was cool. We got two deserts, I can't remember what they were called, but were great, and the breaded calamari was impressive. 

The service was also great, our waitress we didn't catch her name did a great job checking in when appropriate, tapping up on glasses and such, made for a great night.

Just go and give them a try."}
{"text":"Yummy and delicious every time, certainly in the top 5 pizzas I've ever tasted. Everyone in our group was delighted with their meal and has returned for more."}
{"text":"First a disclaimer: I am super picky about pizza. I only really enjoy thin crusted pizza with fresh ingredients. The greasy, fast-food, kind doesn't do it for me. That being said, Pizzaria Libretto definitely falls into the former category.

I honestly wasn't expecting much when we stopped by here. The decor is interesting and trendy but sometimes a flashy decor is used to mask mediocre food. I find this happens often when it comes to \"specialty\" pizza chains. However, this was not the case at Pizzaria Libretto.

I was happy to see that Libretto has a number of veggie-friendly pizza options to choose from, all clearly marked with a meatless symbol. I ordered a standard margherita pizza. While it isn't the most exciting choice on the menu, it's always a good indicator of quality. I was honestly blown away by how good it was. The sauce to cheese ratio was perfect and the crust was exactly as I like it: nice and firm without being crunchy. Wow!

The service here was also fantastic. Our server was very attentive without being pushy. Fabulous overall experience here."}
{"text":"Good, but increasingly unspectacular.

I've eaten here at least 6 times in the past 6 months, so have dropped a decent amount of cash here. The first couple of times were incredible. The pizza zinged in my mouth, hot, just the right kind of oily on top, just the right crust texture, and delicious. The last couple of times were very mediocre, because the pizza was not really hot.

On the most recent trip, the pizzas seriously came to our table about 3 minutes after we'd ordered them. (We didn't get any bread delivered to our table, either, not that there would have been time to eat it.) The pizzas couldn't have been made fresh to our order. We had to assume we'd gotten someone else's pizza, or that Libretto just makes a bunch of pizzas ahead of time and delivers the one to you that you ordered after a quick warm-up. Anyway, the taste is good, the toppings are decent, but the heat is crucial for me for major enjoyment. It's all supposed to be about the oven freshness. It should be near impossible to pick up when it's brought to you. The sauce on the first bite should almost burn you if you bite in too soon. Libretto has not delivered this kind of experience in several visits.

As for the menu, I've enjoyed a couple of the daily special pizzas, but when this doesn't appeal, I've found myself searching for a bit more diversity among the rosso pizzas other than different kinds of sausage.

Libretto is always busy, which makes sense, but It's started to feel a bit like a factory restaurant. And I think the price is a little high for that kind of thing."}
{"text":"Went with a colleague for lunch and was very pleased overall with food, ambiance and service at the University location. Just a stone throwaway from the Toronto underground PATH. Had the lunch special with Beet Salad, Mushroom pizza (Extra $5) and a Espresso Gelato.

The beet and cheese were fresh and nicely presented and tasted good, simple and well made. The pizza was a bit on the garlic-ky side but still good. The server gave the chilli oil after we were half done. Put a little of the oil, but it really does not need any thing on it. The gelato was called cinnamon espresso, my buds tasted no cinnamon. The quantity was just perfect.

Overall quite pleased. Wish I had some more time to sit and enjoy. Perhaps next time for dinner one day. Would definitely return and recommend.

Good vegetarian and perhaps even vegan choices on the menu.

My second time here. The first was an amazing experience and it matched the second brine as well. 

Reached there at 11:45 and tables were filling up. By 12:05 or 12:10, there was already people waiting for a table. 

The service top notch, the interior comfortable and modern. The pizza very good. 

The beet salad and arugula salads ordered as part of lunch special were enough and on the mark. The beet salad should get a special mention. The bread olive oil and balsamic vinegar was OK. Would have preferred the bread warm. 

The pizzas - margherita pizza and cremini mushroom came quickly as we were rushed. The mushroom were plenty on the pizza and the margherita was good, a little less mozzarella and garlic than I prefer. 

The biscotti and the gelato were 5/5."}
{"text":"Per my local friend's suggestion, 4 of us (plus a 2-week old baby) had a fabulous dinner at Pizzeria Libretto. This restaurant is ridiculously popular and extremely crowded even late at night (it was still extremely crowded even when we left around 10:30 or so on Friday).

We shared a bottle of red wine (fabulous), a cheese plate with homemade crackers and assorted condiments (I especially adored the fig jam). My friend's wife also had a gorgeous-looking Caprese salad.

My friend and his wife both ordered Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula each, which looked scrumptious. My boyfriend and I ordered grilled eggplant pizza (his favourite) and Verdura (Goat Cheese, Black Olives, Mozzarella: my favourite) pizza. I loved the chili oil, which was spicy enough. However, my friend got us a small bowlful of chopped up green chili (the one you might see at a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant), which was a lot hotter than the chili oil or chili flakes. I usually love hot and spicy food, but I really didn't think the green chili was necessary...

We also ordered some espresso (very strong!), Espresso Cinnamon Gelato (very espresso-y and sweet cinnamon aftertaste), Biscotti, and Vanilla Affogato (YUM!!!).

Although the restaurant doesn't accept reservations, they did call us when our table was ready. Also, they were accommodating and helpful with my friend's 2-week old baby (who thankfully slept through the dinner despite of all the noise and commotion around her).

We all enjoyed the food, wine, and conversations (and I am glad I wasn't starving!)."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a lovely girl named Alicia did an incredible job taking care of my friends and I! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Pizza crust was burnt, tomato sauce was bland and the cheese was limited. Even the sparkling water was warm. Service was good. The calamari was the highlight of our lunch."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch on a Wednesday. I'm glad I made reservations because the place quickly filled up around noon. I ordered the mushroom, sausage and duck confit pizzas. Although I usually love meat on my pizza, my favourite was the mushroom! It had such great flavours and the truffle oil on it was amazing! The service was quick and friendly and we were in and out of this place in less than 45 min. I would definitely come back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place if you're into Neapolitan style pies. 
Well decorated spot in the ossington corridor.
Food is worth the wait and worth a return trip.
Recommended."}
{"text":"So happy to have a Libretto in the downtown core! Our meal was delicious and our service was lovely. We shared a the burrata, kale salad and fungi pizza. Everything came out fresh, flavorful, and perfectly yummy. I would definitely recommend each dish - I loved the crunchy lentil crouton mix in the burrata. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What makes a great pizza?
The fresh or variety of toppings? The type of cheese? The sauce?
Oh no my dear friends, I beg to differ. It's the dough, it's the crust.
I look for the irresistible chew, crunch, blistered air pockets in the crust with each bite of my pizza. Oh boy, that's what you get here.

Libretto is great! They do pizza right. So good, that I crave it until my next visit.
Authentic or not (I wouldn't know) it tastes real good.
In addition to the delicious crust, the toppings are fresh, the sauce and cheese round off every bite, and the combinations are perfect.

Going at lunch time has it's big perks. For $20 you can partake in their prix fixe menu: Basic pizza, salad, gelato. For $5 extra, you can choose any pizza you wish off the menu, even the most expensive Berkshire Ham pizza ($19). All of the pizzas are sized like a regular pizza pan, bigger than a frisbee... if that helps.

I sat at the bar, really clean and nice to see the workers hustle and bustle prepping numerous things, cleaning and serving. My server was awesome. He gave us detailed descriptions for each pizza, listed the toppings and why it would satisfy certain moods or cravings we had that afternoon. That was a great waiter, personable, knowledgeable and willing to help.  

I started with the Arugula Salad, a serious mound of arugula, pear and walnuts. Slightly bitter but with the cheese and pear, it's a great combination. 

My friend had the Beet Caprese Salad, multi-colored beets, shoots \"seedlings\", and fresh cheese. I preferred this salad.

For the Berkshire Ham Pizza, there are slices of ham on top of cheese and truffle paste. In the middle, a cracked slightly cooked egg. Stab the yolk, spread it out like a natural rich sauce, and enjoy with each bite. It was good but I'm not too big of a ham person so I preferred the Duck Confit ($17) that my friend chose. 

In all honesty, the toppings didn't make matter a great deal to me. It was the crust that made me go from full after eating half to \"must eat the rest, it's so gooood\".

The Gelato was the icing on the cake. It was the perfect end to a great, filling lunch.
Smooth consistency, creamy and sweet.

I admit, a whole pizza with salad is a heavy lunch. You finish it off, walk out of Libretto and THEN realize that you messed with equilibrium. Oh man, is it worth it though!"}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation. The day of my reservation, they called and left a very annoyed message saying \"would you please let us know if you are coming? And by the way, there are people set to take your table right after you so you only have a limited eating time.\" 

What on earth? 

Never again. The people who work here have zero manners."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best gluten free pizza I've had in my life. I was so skeptical it was GF because it looked so puffy and good, but the server mentioned it being GF each step of the way and it clearly looked different than my companions' pizzas. So chewy, so yummy. Going to be a regular customer when I visit TO. Don't skip this!"}
{"text":"One of my good Italian friends makes incredible homemade pizza and focaccia. Pizzeria Libretto is not too far from his level of virtuosity! I came there for lunch and ordered the prix fixe menu ($15 for three courses, a pretty sweet deal in my opinion!). I had the arugula salad with fresh sliced pears, walnuts and Parmigiano. Then, the Margarita pizza. It was perfectly thin, cooked and slightly burnt  -- like it should. A real delight. I did not even feel like adding any salt, which I do most of the time! Last but not least, the espresso / cinnamon gelato was a treat, particularly when it started melting!

Pizzeria Libretto was definitely worth making an exception to my low carb diet! :)))"}
{"text":"So so good.  Perfect spot for a casual date night and easy to share plates.  We ordered the kale salad, meatballs, and prosciutto and arugula pizza.  The salad was perfectly dressed, freshly made and kale crispy and not soggy.  Meatballs were tasty, warm in the centre and perfectly cooked with sauce to dip.  The pizza - YUM-O - I even ate the crust.  I don't think anything else needs to be said!  Good wine list and service.  My new fave pizza place in the city - will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went there after work with friends.  We had the mozzarella with pickled beets and rice balls.  Both were very tasty. The rice balls were the best I have had. 

Then I had their wood fire pastrami pizza.  Excellent and very tasty.  The pizza offers this crust for the middle and a thick crust for those who love that too.  Generally for an artisan pizza there is little substance but this pizza had its fair share of meat and cheese. 

For dessert I had the tiramisu.  Excellent end to a super meal.  The wait staff were patient with us and didn't make us feel rushed.  Some of my co workers were vegetarian and others couldn't have cheese.  There are food items to satisfy all tastes and restrictions.  It was quite the meal.  Will certainly come back."}
{"text":"Dined in and ordered the Arugula salad, Meatball appetizer and the Nduja Sausage pizza. 

Top notch fare overall but the pizza stood out, quickly crafted to authentic Neapolitan standards. Subtle touches like the exquisitely flavoured tomato sauce and slightly chewy crust put these pies in a league of their own. 

Expert service was prompt, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"2.5 stars out of 5.  I ordered the lunch combo which includes a salad, pizza and gelato.  The beets salad was surprisedly good!  Unfortunately, the pizza was burnt (see photo).  The cappuccino gelato was extremely strong so I enjoyed it.

Service here is pretty good."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!  Tried a trio of pizzas - duck confit (love the savory and sweet combo), sausage and pepperoni (spicy!) and mushroom and roasted garlic (whole cloves of buttery garlic).  Loved all 3!  Also enjoyed the arugula salad as a starter.  And the bread - so soft!  This place is busy - we got there at 11:30 and the place filled up within minutes.  Servers were attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 - the service was great starting with the hostess that seated us and even mentioned where the washrooms were. The server was very attentive and even sent our desserts back when she noticed it didn't come the way we had requested it (no chocolate sauce). 

Food: 4/5: I only come here for lunch and get the prix fixe. It's always consistent in taste however my pizza was a bit more burnt than I usually like. The beet caprese salad is wonderful."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the Ontario Tomato Caprese Salad was delicious. But the music was so loud and the other guests were yelling at each other that we couldn't understand the waiter. So we got pizzas without cheese even though he told us while ordering. The pizza base wasn't crispy at all. So they're definitely not italian approved like the pretend."}
{"text":"So ok, I wrote a strongly worded e-mail to the restaurant. In my defence, unknowingly to the manager, who proceeded to tell me that is \"not the way they do things at Pizzeria Libretto\" and further proceeded to send me a gift card inviting me to re-attend the restaurant. 

I didn't want to, to be honest, but, I did. I took two co-workers and my Husband and we ate the daylights out of some appetizers and pizzas but still, the food is underwhelming and the service people are too cool for school. 

After reading so many reviews, both here and online, I thought my first experience at Libretto would include tears, cheese so fine it could make a wolverine purr and vino that you would swear Jesus himself made for you. Not so. Neither time. 

I post this review, however, to demonstrate that a) Even if you're a serial non-complainer (unless, of course, you're Yelping about a place) based on your past experiences of working in retail/hospitality/any other overworked & underpaid line of work, a real, based in reality complaint doesn't always go unnoticed and b) that the manager, at least, is not too cool for everyone and though he has been enjoying unprecedented success and doesn't really \"need\" me as a customer, he still addressed my problem quickly and in a constructive way. 

But now I'm really never going back."}
{"text":"APPEARANCE
Inviting a larger crowd would have probably be a bad idea, especially since they didn't take reservations. Seven people was just the right amount to secure us a larger table by the kitchen. We had to wait a bit, but the staff was very accommodating - took only twenty or so minutes to get our seats.

NOSE
Pizza was the obvious choice. White Anchovy was our pick. We also asked for Piatto Grande for everyone to share at the table. The menu mentioned their special stove and adherence to the strict traditional standards. We liked the fact that their choice of wines came in options of 1/4L, 1/2L. Our choice of wine had to be pretty flexible for everyone. We picked their Sangiovese '12 from Umbria. It was a reasonable choice for the table - light and food friendly."}
{"text":"Yum! Great pizza - I loved the eggplant pizza. My husband's favorite is the margherita. We tried the duck confit, prosciutto, and sausage pizzas and all were delish. The beet caprese was beautiful and yummy, although one of the beet slices was rather tough. Lattes were great and so were the biscotti (one of the dessert options with the prix fixe lunch menu). Service was great too. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and got the mushroom pizza. It was amazing! So many great flavors, including the chili oil! The pizza was perfectly crispy, but still very filling. I also tried the budino -- amazing. I highly recommend this place for a great pizza."}
{"text":"Alright, because of this \"healthy eating\" thing, I've had to cut out pizza from the majority of my life. But once in a blue moon, I still indulge and this time, it was at Pizzeria Libretto. All the pizzas are thin-crust and I LOVE thin-crust. The general rating for this place is exactly what I think it should be: 3.5. I bumped mine up to a 4 because no half points and service was pretty good. 

My friend and I arrived at 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. Already, the tables were not available (half of which were empty but reserved). We ended up sitting at the bar. I actually enjoyed that because we got a lot of attention from the servers. The bread they served was warm and delicious, with balsamic and oil. 

I ordered the Rocco's Salad ($12) and Duck Confit Pizza ($17). I ate the salad at the restaurant and took home the pizza to share. The salad was very refreshing and had a good mix of arugula, beets, squash, proscuitto, and topped with a crispy egg. The dressing was a bit light though and at times, I wished there was a bit more proscuitto or something because some bites were kind of bland. The egg could've also had more salt or flavouring. However, it was an overall solid salad. 

The Duck Confit pizza was definitely a very interesting combination. It had shredded duck pieces, pear slices, and rosemary. We reheated it for a couple minutes in a pan (as suggested by the pizza box). I loved the pieces of duck confit! It was seasoned so well and I would have a pizza topped to the brim with just this. I'm not sure if I enjoyed the texture of the pear as much but overall, the flavour was pleasant. 

My friend got the Nduja Sausage pizza. Though I didn't get to try, I was assured that it was delicious. The waitress also said it's one of the most popular orders there. 

For dessert, my friend and I shared a banana sfingi, which are a collection of small doughnuts made of banana bread-like material and covered in sugar and sauce. It was pretty pricey at $9 but a nice and easy dessert to share. 

Pizzeria Libretto on University is a pretty solid pizza place. I think it's very representative of its location in the Financial District: spending more money for a little more quality to appease all the white collar folks. I don't mind though and I would probably come again, definitely with a reservation next time.

{"text":"Amazing.  The Salami pizza explodes in your mouth.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife, her sister, her sister's boyfriend and I decided to go here after we opted against going to another high end pizza place because of their shoddy service but continued to have a craving for pizza.

On our way there - I made a joke that we might have to wait 45 minutes and if so, we'll just eat at Pizza Pizza (local cheapy chain).  When we arrived, my wife was told the wait time was 45 minutes.  Shoot.  

So, yes, there can be a wait.  

Luckily, a table was finishing up and we got a spot within 5 minutes!

Service - quick and attentive.  The servers are casual ordering was kind of like a friend asking you which beer you want from their fridge. Later,  when I didn't realize I had dropped my napkin and they placed a new one on the table for me while picking up the dirty one. Brownie points!  Water refills were quick and so did the beer.  They also explained what some of the topping were since we weren't entirely sure.

I'm going to go on a slight tangent here and praise the business model of this place.  Any pizza you order is placed in a stone oven heated at 850 to 900 degrees!  This means, according to Pizza Libretto, that pizzas cook for 90 seconds!  In turn, this results in food that is made fresh to order in under 5 minutes - 3 minutes prep time and 2 minutes cook time.  Think about what this means for customer service - High quality food, fast!  Think about what this means for business - quick turnover -$$.  Brilliant!  Anyways...

Anyways, I ordered the salami pizza.  As expected, the pizza came quick.  The crust was light, the toppings were a bit sparse but still provided enough taste and goodness.  The cheese was quality!  I devoured it!  Then I devoured half of my wife's order - margherita (She was full).  Then a quarter of her sister's bf order (He was full).  In all, I almost ate two whole pizzas and I'd do it again!

All in all, great place, good atmosphere, great service but can be pricy at  about $1 for each \"personal\" pizza.  This is expensive 6compared to regular pizza but cheap compared to regular restaurant entrees.  Your call!

PS.  Great place to take a date. :), If you can get seated quickly.
PPS. An Italian buddy of mine says \"that's how pizzas taste in Italy\"."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time with a girl friend on a friday.  Arrived at around 630pm and got seated right away.  We ordered kale salad, crispy calamari, daily special pizza with spicy salami, and finished with espresso gelato and ttiramisu for dessert.

I would give 3.5 stars for its food and 2.5 for its service.  Appetizers were great, not a big fan of their pizza.  The crust reminds me of naan or pita bread, i personally prefer crispy dough.  When we inquired about whether it is supposed to be soft dough, our waitress said we could order well done next time since its how they normally make their pizza.  Tiramisu was yummy, so so for the espresso gelato.

I found the service quite unsatisfactory.  The waitress had no smile to begin with, and after she dropped off the dessert, she asked us if we want the bill right away. The moment we finished dessert and started sipping coffee, she asked if we needed the machine.  Feel like we were rushed to leave.  We enjoyed the evening, but would rather try a different place next time and wont come back."}

{"text":"Dear Margherita,

By the time you read this review, I would have been long gone.................
[To Pizzeria Libretto on Sunday 5pm to eat their Neapolitan Margherita Pizza($13.00 + $3.00 Mozzarella di Bufala) and back home to write this saucey review.]  I'm not sure when you and I will meet again but you'll be missed dearly(until I once again take TTC 45-minutes and Walk 15-minutes).

We've had some good times you and I.  From the beginning[2 offers of Complimentary Bread & Dip(EVOO, Balsamic Vinegar, Chili Oil)] to the very END [Sopping up the San Marzano Tomato Sauce with anything edible].  

Now that our time has come to an end, I wish to speak truthfully that the complimentary Bread would have been much better if served warm and that you offered 2 Basil Leaves on my Friend's slice(Jealous) while I had none. However these little misunderstandings should not keep us apart(from me being Yay! I'm a fan).

I beg for your forgiveness that I did not visit you more often while we had the opportunity but your phone number simply isn't as \"EASY\" to remember as 967-11-11 where she is always \"AVAILABLE\" whenever I need.  She is simply much MORE(Ontario's Largest Pizza Chain) than you could ever offer.

You will always be in the back of my mind for now and always, your Class(Authentic Neapolitan) and your Passion(Knowledgeable Friendly Dude Server) will not be forgotten anytime soon.  Maybe we'll meet again when we least expect it(Danforth Branch?) but until then, Ciao Bella!

Buon Appetito,

{"text":"The food was mediocre and the service was extremely slow. The server was, however, very nice. Also, the prices were reasonable. Still, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a little off the track for a Saturday night dinner place, but this is a good thing as we were able to snag a table right away. 

The d√©cor is chic with high ceilings and a relatively minimalistic look. There's another similar Italian restaurant close by that specializes in pizza and it's so cluttered that space is limited. It was nice to not (literally) rub shoulders with random people and be able to chat with dining companions at a regular voice volume. This location is well staffed with a number of staff visiting tables and seeing how we're doing. 

Now to the food; all our menu choices were winners and can't wait to have it again!
- Caprese Salad w/ Beets: an interesting twist on a classic; I'll have to prepare this at home.
- Arancini: it was good, but not that great that you HAVE to order it.
- Salami Pizza: super flavourful with generous portions of crunchy salami
- Eggplant Pizza: again, super flavourful with a hint of spice (meatless)
- Tiramisu: presentation of it (mason jar) was super cute, but it was just okay (use up these calories for wine instead)

Can't wait to return!

Good for: pizza, quiet night out"}
{"text":"When in the mood for pizza one day, my father suggested Libretto. We went on a Friday night and waited for a good hour to sit down. They do not take reservations and are opened only during the evening hours.

I don't live Downtown and found parking to be an issue. The service was great and the servers were quite helpful when debating as to which pizza would taste the best. The pizza was mediocre - I have had better.

Come here if you plan to go out on Ossington after your meal, but I would not tell anyone to come here unless you're in the area."}
{"text":"My review might not be the most accurate review, but this is what i have to say..
first of all, i didn't have to wait two hours b/c my friends were there waiting far before i got there... so i wasn't annoyed..
i had whatever wine they had ordered, was horrible.. so i can't really comment on that b/c i didn't even look at the wine list..
they ordered four different types of pizzas, and all were fantastic..
i wasn't doing backflips over them, but i liked the dough, perfect smokey smell, soft but thin texture.. was great... toppings were good but like i said, wasn't flipping over them but was satisfied..
I'm still thinking Ferraro's is better.. :)
oh well.. :)"}
{"text":"Sure, the wait is long at this popular pizza destination that doesn't take reservations (its Danforth and University outposts do!), but it is well worth it. 

N'duja pizza is a fave of mine. Buttermilk calamari keeps me coming back with that spicy sauce. So does the great service. 

Make a night of it and you won't be disappointed. It isn't hard to give these pizza purveyors a five-star rating."}
{"text":"Ok, the hype might be over the top but the pizza is pretty damn good. I would like to give 3.5 stars because of THE PIZZA but I just can't be that generous given the drawbacks. That being said, the pizza is authentic Naples style: the dough is elastic, the crust is thin, and spicy chile oil is served on the side. We also had a gnocchi oxtail appetizer that was delicious and a fantastic salty caramel dark chocolate ice cream ball thing for desert. The service was also excellent. To summarize, the food was very good.

The downers: it is too bright. When will restaurants learn that lighting is key?! Also, what is up with the giant flat screen in my face showing the Knicks game? I don't come to Libretta to watch basketball. The decor is a bit strange - neon green walls are unpleasant and the tacky lighting above the bar reminds me of bad Christmas glitz. The wait is too long: 1.25 hours. No reservations. The space is long and narrow and does not accommodate those on the long waiting list. The bathroom area is not overly inviting (bathrooms tend to be a hint of the general standards in the place). Giant boxes all over the basement and some puddles on the floor. Invest in your bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is very good.
The \"pasta\" used to make pizza was amazing.
Ingredients were good, only the \"mozzarella\" was \"ok\"
I know i can't find italian mozzarella in Toronto but i think it would be better... 
If you wanna make the original pizza you have to use the original mozzarella!
Anyway good job Libretto!"}
{"text":"Great new place on University. Super friendly staff. Specializing in pizza but they also serve a perfect latte. Nice decor. Place fills up the moment they open but they do take reservations!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation we tried out Pizzeria Libretto with a few friends for a mid-week dinner. Arriving around 7pm, it was already busy with would-be diners waiting inside. We left our name and phone number and went across the road for a few beers at a bar on the corner of Rolyat St (for a future review).

It ended up being about the hour we were initially quoted, and once back at Pizzeria Libretto we were seated and our waitress provided us with menus. The decision made by the four of us was to each order a pizza and then share so we could try a variety of flavours. The choices were Berkshire Ham, Italian Anchovy, Cremini Mushroom and House-made Sausage.

For starters we got Arancini and Spicy Meatballs for our entr√©e which we ordered to come out with 4 of each and which was happily catered for. The entr√©es were really tasty, the cauliflower puree the arancini came on is not to be left behind either.

The pizzas came out shortly after. One of them ended taking longer due to a minor mishap which required it to be made again. The pizzas are traditionally made pizzas with a thin crust but were a little wet in the middle. This is usually the case with most traditional pizzas, which requires them to be eaten with a knife and fork rather than fingers. 

The Berkshire ham pizza comes uncut with a soft egg in the middle which is mixed across the top before eating. Also to note is that the Italian Anchovy pizza has white anchovies rather than standard pizza anchovies.

The consensus was in favour of the mushroom and the sausage pizzas although they were all very nice. Each pizza is a good size for most with a decent appetite and a bottle of the Ripasso goes really with all the pizzas.

As far as ambience goes, it is not quiet, but this is mainly due to the busy activity of the place. A good place to go with friends for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"It doesn't live up to the hype.  A group of 5 waited over an hour at 7:45pm.  A little bit ridiculous.

Anyway, my pizza was burnt and so was everyone's (to some extent) that I thought they were suppose to be like that.  None of us complained.  The best part of the meal was the bruschetta.  They ran out of venison and had to substitute duck, which probably made it better.

It is definitely a 'happening' place, whatever that means -- loud and obnoxious?  Taste wise, my enjoyment of a slice of Pollo Basillico at Amato's would be at par with this place."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Sunday night. Place wasn't too full so we were seated immediately.
Service was fantastic as the waitress was always there to satisfy our needs.
As for the food, pizzeria libretto never disappoints! I started with the beet caprese salad which was very tasty and refreshing. It was very light and was a perfect start to my meal. As for the pizza, I ordered the diavola (hot salami, onions, kalamata olives). It was absolute perfection. It was cooked beautifully and wasn't too heavy.
Highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pizza.
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sat on their lovely patio for dinner. Waited about 45 minutes for a table on the patio on a Wednesday night. Good service that was very attentive. Our wines and water glasses  were never left empty. Timing of our appetizers and mains were good. 

We started with the fried risotto balls and buttermilk calamari. Both highly recommend to order. The risotto balls came out hot and very creamy. The calamari was stacked into a fun tower and was very delectable. 

We decided on three different pizzas: the classic margherita, prosciutto and arugula and the sausage. My favourite was the margherita! It was so cheesy and the basil accent was perfect. My second favourite would be the sausage pizza - just the right about of meaty goodness without being too salty. The prosciutto was hard to cut and share but was also very notable and worth trying. All pizzas had a nice crispy outer thin crust. Slightly soggy in the middle.

Will definitely come back and re-order re margherita!!! Hopefully try some white sauce pizzas as well."}
{"text":"It's another solid experience here at Pizzeria Libretto.  The atmosphere in the dining room is welcome and there is a buzz but not overly deafening chatter from the patrons.  People are nice here. :-)

The menu had a lot of great choices of real Neapolitan pizza.  I eventually settled on the duck confit pizza bianca.  Who am I kidding?  I can't say no to duck confit.  Yum.

The pizza comes out really quick and before you know it, you are sitting in front of a fresh wood-fired pizza asking to devoured.  That's exactly what happened.

Great time and look forward to coming back again next time around."}
{"text":"For $16, you really can't go wrong with their classic pizza prix fixe menu.  It includes:

1) Beet caprese or arugula salad
2) Margherita or marinara pizza
3) Chocolate pistachio biscotti or pudding

The taste was fantastic on all items. Friendly & efficient service (e.g. the waitress knew when to come by to pack any food/gave us the bill during lunch hours)"}
{"text":"2.5.

Libretto has a great vibe, if a strange layout (not really the restaurant's fault, I guess). I've only ever sat at the bar, and having an extended, wrap around, chef's-table like space is charming, in its way. Servers seem to be friendly, normally smiling and engaging.

The $15 lunch special is a great idea (salad, a selection of a couple of the cheapest pizzas, and a dessert), and I have to say the wine list is varied and interesting (although the Salice Salentino is absolutely disgusting), and the range of service options they give is impressive; glass, quartino, half-litre, and the bottle, of course.

At the end of it all, this is a pizza place, and the pizza is below so-so. The crust is bland and only prevented by being floppy by the disappointingly low amount of toppings and cheese. In that regard, the sauces are flavorless, and the cheeses don't taste particularly high quality and are also underused. The price point is decent, but even the duck confit pizza which everyone raves about (good, I'll grant you) felt like a rip-off. Coming back to the crust, how can a kitchen staff that makes this many pizzas serve so many of them so burnt? I've never had one that wasn't, and looking around during my visits, the majority of other pizzas I've seen had at least some blackness on them. Furthermore, how can a crust so burnt on the outside be so underdone in the middle? Yes, I'm being harsh, perhaps, but the amount of things that are off about the pizza here is disappointing, to say the least.

Again, the service is good, quick, and friendly, the establishment seems very well run, the space is very inviting for being so small, the wine selection is excellent...but at the core of it all, the pizza just isn't worth going in for. If it was anything other than a pizza place, an easy recommendation. However, Libretto is instead a lucky beneficiary of very generous word-of-mouth."}
{"text":"This was our \"2nd dinner\" of the night. Having already been full we were only going to have a slice each. Well we ended up ordering a whole 2nd pizza because it was so delicious! The margarita was our fav. So much flavor"}
{"text":"Dear Pizzeria Libretto,

I cannot say how much I love you guys. Literally. I love coming to any of your locations. So it's no different that this location was any less great then the Danforth one (that I frequent the most). 

You are my favourite restaurant chain in my heart.
Thank you for always being consistent with the food and the service.

Love,
Your biggest fan"}
{"text":"I find the best way to compare on fair grounds pizza shops is to get the always-available Margherita. Luckily, it's their speciality. 

We ordered the Libretto Margherita, which was a decent portion. One very hungry person could eat the whole thing. For myself and my friend, we shared one, and the risotto appetizer. The risotto was slightly disappointing - rather bland. Bread with olive oil was served.

We've grown accustomed to focusing on the toppings and the sauces, but let me say the crust was the best part. Mind you, the dollops of cheese and tomatos were delish, but the crust was just... perfect. It was thin crust that was the perfect balance of savoury, thickness, and texture. (Tip: don't forget to wipe up some chilli oil with it!)
Fun fact we read on the menu: pizzas here are cooked in an 800 degree oven for 90 seconds! 

This place definitely lives up to its hype! :)

Next time I will try the Duck Confit pizza and the croquettes!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about pizza libretto and this restaurant definitely lives up to its rep. The pizza was delicious (we had a large group and managed to order 9-10 different flavours), my favourite was the margherita pizza!

Dessert was amazing as well, we had the tiramisu and strawberry panna cotta, both which were delicious. I'm definitely going back to trying out more in the future!"}
{"text":"Not that impressed with the pizza here. It tasted a bit bland, and didn't have many toppings. Maybe they were going for the minimalist thing. Service was also slow, and to be honest, not that friendly either."}
{"text":"Service staff and management are attentive, courteous and professional. Their calamari and beef carpaccio appetizers are superb, even the bread provided when you first sit down is great.

On this last visit, the pizza was a bit of a let down. Nearly all the slices across the five pizzas ordered by our table had strong burnt bitterness to it. The pizzas themselves weren't burnt, so my best guess is the surface they were made on hadn't been cleared of whatever burnt before.

Overall a good time. Might be back, but will be more critical of what we're served next time."}
{"text":"Incredible, well-composed calamari dish. Fluffy, delicious rosemary foccacia with seasoned good quality oil and balsamic (free... ask for seconds :)). Nice wine list. Good beer. Lively unpretentious atmosphere. Very reasonable, especially considering the caliber of the kitchen. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I came for a business lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. Service was good, prix fixe a great deal,  food tasty. The place is packed at lunch so make a reservation or arrive super early. The gelato at the end of the meal was one of the best I have ever had (which says a lot because I frequent all the places on College/Little Italy )."}
{"text":"I came here prepared to be blown away by the pizza and I was blown away by the charcuterie platter instead! Now, I rate this place 3 stars as I don't think it's worth the wait in line and their charcuterie is better than their signature dish.

All this being said, I still very much enjoy the pizza but sometimes it's possible to make a great thing worse by over complicating the ingredients. Theres a reason why arguably the best pizza place in the world (Da Michelle in Napoli) serves nothing but the classic Margherita; simplicity is beautiful. 

I conclude my review by saying this: go to libretto and share the charcuterie board, it's fantastic.  While you're there, you may as well have pizza ;)"}
{"text":"Some ahmaaazing pizzas and desserts! This place is really close to my work place so I have been there a lot ! I love all their pizzas and their desserts especially their amaretto chocolate thingy is selfish ! A must try."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to restaurant. Perfect place for a business lunch, celebratory dinner or date night. Pizza is fantastic and so is the Kale Salad. Price of the food is reasonable and consistently good. The only problem is that reasonable parking isn't so plentiful in the area, but I will brave the lots to eat here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there a few times and the pizza is not as good as Queen Margarita. It was better at first opening but I think down the road they changes the ingredients a bit. I find it annoying that they don't t reservations but that's because the owner doesn't really worry about customer satisfaction. Whenever I get out of town visitors , that place comes up on the list but waiting in line for hours makes no sense."}
{"text":"After doing some research, Pizzeria Libretto was my top choice for a pizza and wine dinner with my boyfriend while on a recent trip to Toronto. I'm a pizza junkie and the promise of a crispy wood-fired pizza was just the thing after a long day of driving and sightseeing. The interior was great--kind of industrial yet still managed to be cozy and the service was fantastic. My valpolicella was excellent and my boyfriend enjoyed a local craft brew. He ordered the specialty pizza (something with chili peppers, sausage and spinach) and I ordered the margherita. The server described the pizza style as thin crust, crispy with a slight char. It had ALMOST all of those things. Thin crust, check. Slight char, check. Crispy? Not so much. In fact I thought it was kind of underdone and I'm still wondering how they managed to get a char on the soggy crust. That was kind of a disappointment for me, but overall it was still decent. I did also like the option to make your reservation online, although when we arrived there weren't that many people inside so it didn't seem entirely necessary."}
{"text":"My wife and I got two take out pizzas. We were sitting down to eat within 5 minutes of picking up order and there was no heat left in the food - maybe they sat in the kitchen too long before being brought up. 

While the ingredients were fresh and flavorful (basil, tomato, cheese, onions and sausage), we were very disappointed in the crust. 

The crust had a nice char, but it was not crispy, just chewy. There was way too much chili oil on one the the pizzas, creating a soggy mess in the center."}
{"text":"Visited this Toronto famous pizzeria a few weekends ago during their down time around 3ish on a Sunday. I know there are a few around the city but wanted to try the original.

The staff was nice and we got a table by their front open window which had a nice breeze and gorgeous view of their restaurant. 

We ordered their arancini and nduja sausage pizza, the arancini was crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside with amazing tomato sauce to top it all with. Fresh and still making my mouth water now. 

The pizza on the other hand was disappointing... the dough in the middle was soggy and seemed a bit underdone. The cheesy which I wished was gooey was very watery, which explains the sogginess. The crust itself was delicious and chewy like it should be but if we had more time I would have said something to our waiter. Or if he had come back to check in. Ended up paying at the counter. 

A bit disappointed with this visit but thought maybe it really was a down time."}
{"text":"I haven't worked in the Financial District for over three years now and it's probably a good thing because I'd go broke because of this place.

I can usually spare enough time for lunch to come down every couple of months to catch up with friends who work in the area and this is consistently the place that we meet up.

I usually book a table for four a couple of weeks in advance and see who is available to meet up for lunch. I have to take the first three responses. From the lineups I see on weekday lunches, reservations are a must!

The standard order each time is four pizzas so that each person can try a slice from each.

The crust is cooked at the right texture and there are both the right amount and combination of toppings to make the pizzas top notch. There are never any leftovers. I haven't tried any of the other locations for comparison but this one is the most convenient for me and I am completely fine with that.

It's a bit pricier than the standard food court fare but it is what you'd expect if you're going to a \"sit down\" restaurant for lunch. The quality is definitely worth the extra expenditure... so much that it becomes a value purchase? Definitely worth a try... at any time of day!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was pretty excited to have some good pizza. I came with a bunch of friends and we all decided that we would order different things and share. Well, that was all good in theory.

Once the pizzas came the ones that had the \"good\" pizzas never wanted to share and I got stuck with the super mushroom one that tasted like feet. I did try another one, it was the ricotta pizza, and I was hooked, I was already planning my second trip there.

Upon my second visit, I was determined, I didn't even look at the menu and told the waiter I wanted the ricotta pizza, he then went on to inform me that they had run out of the ricotta pizza! NOOO! What was a girl to doooo???!!! I stared intensely at those that ordered my pizza but did not finish. Grrr! I decided to order the second safe pizza and one of my favourites, the margherita (basically the same pizza minus the ricotta). And I wasn't disappointed. 

The crust was perfect and it was just delicious. It wasn't too soggy where the pizza fell flat when lifted it but you did need to get a little dirty with this pizza. I find that the ones with heavy toppings never stay together, so for this type of crust, you have to have a light pizza like the margherita. 

The wait time is a little ridiculous because it is first come first serve and the tables are cramped together in which you can have an accidental arm graze with your neighbour or even leg graze. But they are good in that they will take your phone number down and call you when your table was ready so that you wouldn't cramp up their small little waiting area.

The wait staff is friendly and extremely casual, there doesn't seem to be a set dress code which can confuse me at times since they all dress like hipsters as do the patrons. Many a time I have almost flagged down a patron to check on my order. Oopsies, but I would definitely come back and I will definitely order the coveted ricotta pizza."}
{"text":"A popular trendy pizza place that has various restaurants in Toronto. I've been to Pizza Libretto a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed their delicious pizzas and other dishes. I've always had a pretty positive experience here. Great atmosphere, good food and great friendly staff with good customer service! This time around, I ordered the Margherita Neapolitan pizza & Margherita Neapolitan pizza. Both excellent dishes to order here. While we were waiting for our food, we got complimentary bread.  The calamari one is definitely one of my favorite appetizers to get here as it's quite delicious. Nice hot crispy battered calamari dipped in romesco sauce is a great combination. My friends thoroughly  enjoyed their pizzas as we tried each other's pizza. Overall, a great pizza restaurant to get some delicious pizza and appetizers. Definitely coming back as a regular customer!"}
{"text":"This is one of the newest locations of the Toronto pizza chain. Definitely not expecting it to be in some dark alley way but that's okay. The food was great. They sat us at the bar because my friend and I didn't have a reservation. Place is clean, lights were a bit dim from my preference but I think that's part of the cozy ambience they want to portray of the place.

We weren't very hungry but I really wanted to try their pizza. We got one to share: Ontario proscuitto and arugula. Pizza dough is good. Too much arugula on top but that's okay since they're just greens that you can eat separately. That chili oil though. Just drizzle that in the pizza! Definitely good pizza and I'll eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that I love this place!  I just recently discovered this little gem (I know, I really do need to get out more).  

This place is a perfect spot for meeting up with friends, date night, groups, etc...it really hits all the marks.  The decor is casual, and quite welcoming...I love the red walls and the exposed electrical cord light fixtures.  

I've had their margarita pizza everytime I've been there, with one slight modification, I asked them to add pepperoni, and its was AMAZING.  I love me a thin crust pizza and this one does not disappoint.  I also tried their tiramisu, which wasn't as firm as I like, but still tasted pretty darned good.

Price point is on the money too...if you're having a low budget week, you can easily settle in for a pizza with a friend for $25 - tip included.  

Love this place and it's now on my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"yes yes yes yes yes I mean really obviously Pizza Libretto is off the chain. Their $15 lunch special is almost too good to be true!!! Salad + dessert AND a full pizza??  I've tried a lot of their \"fancier\" pizzas and they're all good but my favourite has to be their straight up Margherita D.O.P \"doppio\" version. The sauce, the cheese, the crust, just all so perfect! Their desserts are all amazing too, I especially love the ice cream, mmmmmmm. Also they have a nice selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza and atmosphere at this place! It was a nice summer day when I went so we were able to sit outside in the patio. All the waiters were extremely nice as well!

We ordered the Arancini (italian rice balls with cheese inside), the Duck Confit pizza and a special they had with soppressata (spicy salami). We really enjoyed everything that was ordered, especially the Arancini balls!! The green sauce with it (I think it's mint and parsley) went really well with the arancini !! You should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza spots in the city! The Margarita pizza sauce is made with fresh plump tomatoes. Almost tastes like I was back in Napoli :)"}
{"text":"I just made a quick visit to Libretto after hearing so much about their amazing pizza. The flavouring was decent, however their thin+wet combination of the crust was personally not the most enjoyable. Also it was, in my opinion, a bit overpriced for its quality AND quantity. Our server was decent but not the most attentive. 

I will be sticking to my usual go-to, Levetto, until I find something better in the city."}
{"text":"Came here with the understanding that this place makes the best pizza in Toronto. I was not impressed but satisfied. 

I was really excited by the website dedication to keeping the authentic Neopolitan style pizza making process but I've been to Naples and eaten in several Naples pizzerias and it is better in Naples.

The place is very busy but our wait was less than 15 minutes around 6:15PM on a Sunday. 

We were hoping to try the margherita and duck confit pizzas. They didn't have the duck confit pizza on the menu anymore. So we went with the margherita and the wild mushroom pizza. We started with the buffalo moz and tomato, basil appetizer. Solid, tasty but small portions. 

The pizzas came out hot and had a nice thin crust. The toppings were sparingly applied but everything worked well together to the bite. The wild mushrooms pizza had a thicker crust and meatier feel, which I enjoyed.

So....good pizza, don't expect Italy quality pizza but perhaps among the best in Toronto. The other option is Terroni''s which is hit and miss."}
{"text":"Great pizza place in a very cool rising-star neighborhood. 

The place was hopin but there were seats at the bar which has become my strong preference anyway, so no wait on this evening. Prosciutto di Parma was a prefect start. Then came the Nduja sausage (hyper spicy :-) pizza - outstanding. The sausage is made in house. If you like it hot (and I do), you must try this. Thin crust in a 900F oven makes the crust just right. 

Several local brews on tap

Libretto is on Ossington. It's a little difficult to describe this street, but imagine eclectic small bars and restaurants lining both sides of several blocks interspersed with auto repair shops and other relics. So cool."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is getting good review. Traveled all the way and I was so disappointed. The service was horrible. Waitress refuse to suggest or recommend pizza. She basically told I don't have time to suggest anything call me when you are ready and walked away. Place was loud and crowded. Pizza was wet and you can see water dripping down from it. The dough doesn't bounce back when you bite down on it. It tasted more like a pita. The pizza was not worth $15. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant with my partner.  We both had pizzas.  They taster great but the crusts were not cooked, soggy bottoms.  The manager and server picked up our plates half full and they never asked us if we liked our pizzas.  They obviously didn't care to know.  Overall, not impressed. I doubt that we'll ever go back there."}
{"text":"The wood burning pizza is fantastic! Actually one of the best pizzas I have ever had! Had the prosciutto and arugula pizza. So good"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Libretto I was sold. The second time made me regret ever singing its praises to my friends. 

I had heard amazing things about the pizza from colleagues and reviewers and (being a pizza fanatic) I knew I needed to try it out for myself. We waited over an hour on a Wednesday night for a table but it was worth it - pizza excellent, server gracious, house wine CHEAP and good. 

The second time I went, I brought a friend from out of town along with another person and it was about 5:00 pm on a Saturday (and we still waited 30 minutes). They sat us even though one person hadn't shown up (which I thought was very nice) and we ordered wine and appetizers. From that moment on, our experience was horrible. Two gentlemen (who may be the owners) were snarky, rolled their eyes and even gave us dirty looks while OBVIOUSLY talking about us from 4 feet away. They even ticked off the hostess for seating us within ear shot of other patrons. 

Literally, it was 20 minutes until the 3rd member of our party arrived, which wasn't the plan but there was a streetcar issue. Of course, I completely understand that it's annoying since restaurants want the table for the next group but then they shouldn't have sat us! There was no policy, no 'we need to know when your friend is arriving', etc. We just followed their instructions and were chastised for it. I have never had such an uncomfortable meal in my life. 

Libretto is resting on positive reviews and trying to push as many people through in an evening as possible without focusing on the dining experience. They should at least happy to have you sit for the length of time as you waited for their (albeit pretty good) pizza.  Sadly, I will never go back and have ensured my friends know I have rescinded my formerly-high recommendation."}
{"text":"This is pizza at its best. Absolutely delicious and great value. Recommend the kids deals. The environment is warm and inviting, staff were excellent. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This location is definitely less crowded (and slightly hidden) with great service. Decor is Trendy/design-y Italian kitchen but felt friendly/approachable. The pizzas are thin with burnt edges that give it a nice texture and aroma. Very soft and chewy. The toppings were extremely fresh and flavourful. I enjoyed every bite tasting the core ingredients and end notes of oils, spices, and herbs. The service is also well paced and the fried calamari and gnocchi are so good! Oh, did I mention the pizzas are 12\"? It's huge so come hungry! 

Only downside is that they only carry terrible beers. Peroni, Flying Monkey, Goose Island, Steam Whistle...Wheat beers... etc... horrible beers.. but that's just a personal opinion :)

This is a 5 star restaurant but I just want some good beers :')"}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed with the pizza as I expected to be.  I assume all the rave reviews are from people used to Pizza Pizza  or some other chain pizzerias in Toronto.

While the crust was indeed thin and marked with the black blisters from the 900 degree oven, it was also unpleasantly chewy and not crisp.

The toppings are sparingly applied and you need to bite carefully if you want something other than just sauce.

Lemon foam on the hazelnut budino was a bad idea.  It clashed with the chocolatey flavours.  As well, what was with having the espresso for the affogato come into a metal cream jug?  That looked ghetto and cooled it too quickly.  Didn't want to wash an espresso cup?

The servers seemed a bit robotic and devoid of warmth.  While the service was mostly okay, near the end they forgot to come back and we ran out of water, which was unfortunate because the sardines were very salty on my pizza."}
{"text":"We just went for lunch on Saturday and the special was to die for!

Soup, salad and a half sandwich. YUM! Soup was white bean and green kale made with proscuitto stock. It was perfect. SO rich and delicious! Arugula fall salad with beets and a proscuitto sandwich finished it off. Wow. $9 and I was sated. 

I will say it felt almost heretic to eat at Libretto without having the pizza but wow that was stupendous.

The staff is so nice too. Lunchtime is a little less busy and more relaxed for them, and they really took care of us.

Libretto is not just for dinner. Enjoy the lunch too!"}
{"text":"4 separate pizzas , eggplant, sausage, spicy and special 

All pizzas awesome 

Server Sean was awesome 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Specialty: Pizza
Location: 221 Ossington Street, Toronto, ON 
Menu items: Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti, Buttermilk Calamari, Ontario Proscuitto & Arugula Pizza, Duck Confit White Pizza and Chocolate-Amaretto Budino

Pizzeria Libretto is known in Toronto for their amazing execution of Neapolitan-style pizzas. But did you know their appies and desserts are also really good?
It took me a while to become a fan (after my 5th visit in 3 years) and come to terms with their pizza style. My first experience was not great due to bad service, but the few following were flawless. Being a declared Terroni pizza lover, I found my taste buds unaccustomed to the texture of Neapolitan pizzas, so I never brought myself to give this place a second look. Defaulting always to white pizzas, like the Duck Confit, I was never really introduced to Libretto's secret tomato sauce; until one day I deviated from my choice, and found their pizzas to be quite succulent in their own way, including their incredible appetizers and desserts.

For starters, literally, their buttermilk calamari seating on a bed of red pepper-almond sauce is crazy good. The calamari is perfectly dusted in breadcrumbs, plated in a beautiful pyramid and tender on bite. Their ricotta gnocchi fritti, like the calamari, is a simple deep-fried creation of ricotta cheese and gnocchi nubs ready to dip in a crema fresca sauce layered with rosemary and chives. The breading on these nubs is rather sweet and lighter on bite than that of the calamari, but just as good.

Libretto's traditional take on a prosciutto-arugula pizza marks the beginning of an era of Neapolitan pizzas for me. The secret of these pizzas is found in Libretto's tomato sauce - light, smooth and full of flavour - and the cooking process of the thin-crust delicacies, 90 seconds by clock in the hot wood-fire oven, with the pizza arriving with heat bubbles that pop open as you eat and dig through your pizza, or that crush as you fold it with your hands to hold it all together. Ingredients used on this pizza are not only fresh but also of good quality.

The only white pizza on the menu, and my good ol' favourite, the Duck Confit Pizza is my favourite on the menu. Called white pizza because it has no tomato sauce, this pizza goes head-to-head with the C't Mang from Terroni for the use of sweet and salty ingredients. In the case of Libretto, this pizza comes oozing with mozzarella covered with duck pieces, bosc pear and rosemary. A happy combination of flavours and ingredients that just work well together and make a symphony in ones palate.

And beyond the pizzas, there is always good dessert if you venture into the land of the Chocolate-Amaretto Budino. Budino means pudding in Italian. In this case, is a rich creamy chocolate and amaretto dessert layered inside a jar with small pieces of peach, fresh cream and crunchy hazelnuts bites. It almost seemed like such an indulgence to be eating the budino with a spoon right out of a jar.

Pizzeria Libretto is such a hot spot that at 5pm the place is already packed with families, couples and groups storming in the brick-wall decorated venue, with thick wooden tables filled with baskets of delicious bread and bottles of olive oil.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, for appetizers we ordered the flank steak skewers the steak was so greatly cooked BEST STEAK IVE EVER HAD!!!. The salami pizza had great flavor the pizza's slices were so big i can fold it and eat it like a taco. The marinara pizza was okay, as long as you ate it with the cheese that came along with it. If it is eaten without the cheese it is difficult to find a good flavor to help you enjoy it as you eat it. 

The service was not the best, the hostess was a bit rude and it was a long wait. The waitress on the other hand, was much better. Other than the service the food was delicious. I recommend Pizzeria Libretto, if you love pizza and are patient with people."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually come here for lunch for their delicious prix-fixe menu but came here for dinner this time. We ordered the burrata and beef carpaccio to start. Both are so delicious... the burrata cheese is soft in the middle and the tomato and prosciutto combo works really well. The beef carpaccio had some garlic aioli on top which was a good match. For the mains, they only serve pizza but they do it well! For 3 people, we ordered 2 pizzas to share: the funghi di bosco which had a white sauce base and was loaded with cheese and mushrooms, the second pizza was melanzane which was a vegetarian pizza with big slices of eggplant and whipped ricotta. So good! They packaged the remaining slices for leftovers. To finish the dinner, we shared the tiramisu and budino. Both were the perfect ending to a truly authentic italian dinner. Will be coming here again! Ideal for date night, they also have a small patio if you can manage to snag a spot."}
{"text":"Finally cam here and it did not disappoint. 

Long line up but meh so worth it.  We had the meatballs, rice balls, and pizzas.

I just got hungry right now thinking about it yuummm and that chili oil? Bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to their other restaurant on Ossington a couple years ago. I was a little disappointed by this one because everyone at the table got their pizza before I did and when mine arrived, it was burnt on the bottom. The waitress said it was \"because of the oven\"."}
{"text":"I was there with my friend before a show at Lower Ossington Theatre. This pizzeria was recommended grrr my colleagues at work and being a Terroni's fan, my bar is high. I must say I was quite disappointed at the food. While the salads were good, the pizzas were disappointing. The sauce was too watery making the pizza very soggy. It was never like this at Terroni's. When I asked about the wine, the tattooed server said \"we don't have house reds or whites\". Okayyy, so I ordered a Soarve which was soso. The wine list at Terroni's is just more robust and the servers much less arrogant. This place is quite over rated."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their $15 fixed lunch menu.  I had an impeccably dressed arugula salad with shaved Parm, sliced pear and walnuts.  The Margherita pizza is easily the best that I've ever had.  A single scoop of vanilly gelato rounded out the meal nicely.  The service is courteous, friendly and informative. 

My wife and I are already planning our next trip in from the suburbs!"}
{"text":"Good place to have nice Italian food... However lack of pizza variety compare to other places in downtown toronto... Overall i will rate 3 for nice food and service.."}
{"text":"A place worth  trying,we came after friends telling us that they had some of the best pizza in the city.

This is what's we had:

butter calamari:crispy and tender one of the best calamari I have ever tried. 14 cad

meatballs and sauce: tasty meatballs surrounded by tomato sauce with cheese, the meat is just perfect and the sauce is rich and flavourful just a little too much cheese 10 cad

duck Confit pizza: tasty pizza well balance flavors we were expecting more duck on it 17 cad
 
we also had 2 pint so steam wishtle 7 cad each and table water that is 3 cad"}
{"text":"THE GREATEST PIZZA IN TORONTO.

Seriously? Hells yes. They start with a perfect pie, then build a dining experience. When you arrive the anticipation builds; from the aroma of garlic, to the bustling, high-energy dining room that gets your senses peeked for an authentic Italian Pizzeria in our own backyard.

Libretto uses mostly D.O.P. ingredients for their sauce and pizzas (Foodies you know what I mean, for the rest- it means authentic Italian tomatoes, etc, imported to preserve Italian ingredients' legacy and tradition). They use a wood-burning stove for their pizza to give it the slightly-charred home-baked taste you've been craving.

The staff are impeccable and they pay close attention to detail. They're knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, plus they infuse your table with that bustling energy you feel when you walk in the restaurant. They even made my favourite Italian aperitif for me on request (FYI- The Tampico: 1oz Gin, 1oz Campari, top with tonic water, garnish with orange slice). 

They were featuring an unbeatable $25 Prix Fixe when we dined, which included four courses and your choice of any of their pizzas! What a bargain! 

I highly recommend Pizzeria Libretto for a first date, a party, or as the catalyst for a great night in the Dundas/Ossington area. It's \"Pizza Amore\" and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were served like queens! Celebrating our friends wedding, they took care of her bill and brought us delicious lemon cello. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Thank you for making our night so special!"}
{"text":"Very cool place (mozzarella lights) with even better food. Great selection of draft beers and wines. Wines are offered from glass to 1/4L to 1/2L to bottle which is very convenient. 
Right from the start the meal was special: 
- the focaccia with EVOO, balsamic vinegar, and their in-house made hot oil was delicious
- the meatballs and calamari were absolutely excellent
- the salami pizza and the mozzarella pizza were outstanding
- the homemade sausage pizza was good

I think what made the food so good were the fresh, simple ingredients. Our server Shawn was helpful in our menu selection and provided excellent service. I would definitely return and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"fresh pizza i've tried!
but here is soooo noisy i've been

but maybe i will visit again"}
{"text":"I remember my first experience with Libretto 4 years ago at the Ossington location. I was smarter back then as I had just the pizza and I remember walking away wanting more. A few weeks ago at the University Ave location I made the mistake of sharing a few apps with my dining companions. It's not that the apps weren't good, really good in fact (warm olives, calamari, arugula salad) but I was too full to truly relish the main event, the awesome pizza! A few notes about the location and atmosphere: spacious, tasteful decor, reasonable noise level even when the place was full, and spectacular service!!  We sat at the bar because all the tables were full and it really felt like we got the royal treatment. We ordered a few different pizzas and I had the basic margherita which was as good as I remembered from the old location years ago. I couldn't try the other pizzas with meat but it appeared they were appreciated by my dining companions. I had as well a decent red wine (1/4 litre for $16), sparkling water ($3 for unlimited refills for our entire group) and delicious bread and oil to start (you will be asked if you really want it before they set it down- you really don't need it, believe me). I'm very likely to return to this location. One of the reasons I didn't go back to Ossington was due to the long wait and small, crowded, seating. Their pizza at either location still stands out to be one of the best in this city."}
{"text":"How many Libretto's are there? This one had to be by far the easiest to get a seat at. So how does everything else measure up?

Service, very nice and doesn't seem as pretentious as others.

Beverage selection, I feel this one has more variety; I got a seasonal selection from Left Field brewery which was awesome.

Pizza, the margherita is delicious as always. But either I forget how the other locations were or this one is a step below, or there is just so much neopolitan pizza around that my palate is changing. The crust flops re weight of the ingredients.

Other food, the salad with the fried egg was delicious!

Decor, it is bright, airy, large, has nice patio, nothing like ossington.

The issue is really the pizza. When you're a pizza place, gotta hit the homeruns.

Location, it's in a bit of an odd location between office buildings on a side street. But I guess if it's a destination, who cares."}
{"text":"Actually went here a while back. This place was jam packed, so hard to get a seat. So many people had said they waited so long and it wasn't worth the wait. I'd say the pizza itself is worth the wait.

Had to try the margherita pizza. The dough was light, lots of basil flavor. Could just taste what a nice base subsequent pizzas would be. But this would be the only one I had this night.

The service staff was nice once I got seated. But I waited there for a while when I arrived, only to watch the waitress give a table of two to someone who had arrived earlier. Only when I called her out on it, did she claim to \"not see me\", and then subsequently got a seat very shortly after.

Watch out for your seat!"}
{"text":"Don't let the prices scare you away from this gourmet pizza! Their flavour combos are genius and there is genuine care put into each dish - you can tell. Calamari was especially pleasing as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner last week with my family and we had a delightful time.  We were all in the mood for some pizza, and since Libretto is generally considered to be the best pizza place in town, we made the drive here (from opposite ends of the city) on a Tuesday night.  We arrived at the restaurant around 9:00 pm and only had to wait about 15 minutes before the 4 of us were seated.

We had the bruschetta (which my brother loved), the arugula and caprese salads (which were both light and refreshing), the verdura pizza (with seasonal zucchini), the eggplant pizza, the margherita (with bufali di mozarella) and the homemade sausage.  Being the only meat eater of the bunch, I was the only one eating the sausage pizza (and it happened to be my fave), but the veggie pizzas were all tasty (it being a tossup between the margherita and the verdura as to which was the best).

The available chilli flakes and chilli oil certainly helped enhance an already tasty pizza.  For some reason, I recall the pizzas being more moist when I came here the last time, but nonetheless this problem was solved with a generous helping of the chilli oil.  We all left happy customers."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. They got their pizza right with the perfect ratio of chew to crispiness that leaves me craving their pizzas all the time. Ordered their duck confit pizza and it was amazing as was their fried calamari - perfectly prepared with the right amount of batter and not overly greasy. Love it!"}
{"text":"Liked the beet and goat cheese salad the most.  Calamari was good too. Strangely enough I wasn't too impressed with the pizza.  I like a heart, crunchy crust... this one is more like a pita than a pizza crust"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch yesterday....yum.  The lunch special is great value.  A salad, a pizza (margherita, and something else -sans cheese) and a dessert for $15.  You can substitute any other pizza on the menu for an additional $5.  I love the thin crust pizza (i'm not a big crust-eater unfortunately, but the little I had, was a bit salty for my liking, but I find most things a bit salty...
Overall it was a great experience, and the food was delish.  Worth checking out.  I'm going to try their other location next time, just to see how they compare :)"}
{"text":"The pizzas are really good especially when they are right out of the oven. It's a thin crust pie haven!

My fave are the homemade sausage pizza and a daily special with a sweet creamy sauce with prosciutto and lots of cheese. The mushroom pizza was too salty for my liking. 

Line ups are crazy, be sure to arrive early, by 6pm for dinner, if you don't want to wait for a table."}
{"text":"By far this is the very best pizza in Toronto.  And not only that, the service is always top notch! 



Love the place... Fantastic Bombastic!"}
{"text":"Pizza Libretto has restored my faith in thin crust pizzas....so there is such thing as a thin, soft, and easily cuttable slice of goodness that can be made in a hot stone oven and be at your table side in under two minutes, PL you make some good pizza and have some great people serving it.

I have tried thing crust at two places - one in Vancouver which i will keep anonymous, and Toronto's Terroni which I had such high hopes for. In both cases, the crust was hard and a knife was surely not tough enough to cut through the rubbery crust. 

My experience at Libretto is as follows...probably overl excited as I walked into the door and almost ran two ladies over, I gave my name down and the waitress kindly told me that they would give me a ring when a table opened up. We went next door to Salt for a drink, which I must say was very tasty but too short because I got the phone call quickly afterwards..I was very pleased none the less.

although we were offered a table at the bar, I think it worked out to be the best situation because there was a tv with the exciting football game on- how lucky we're we!

The waitress was top knotch from the moment I sat down- Shannon was her name and she was an absolute joy, from taking photos of us, to making sure that the wine we had selected would satisfy our palettes. While searching the the wine list, we noticed a sparkling red that we were very intrigued by..you don't see those often. It tasted like a good red wine, with notes of carbonation and bubbles.., it was wonderful!

Having read so much about the calamari, it was something I had to get, accompanied by red pepper aioli. They came perfectly in a tower which S and I pretended to play Jenga with. I don't know if anyone has ever questioned this but I wonder if the calamari is prepackaged. The way the batter is tied, in my mind seemed artificial, unlike the overly greasy deep fried batters you may find elsewhere. Believe me, these tasted amazing, with the calamari at a good Size, and perfectly cooked, not rubbery and overlooked. The sauce had just a bit of kick that you could taste and leaving you wanting more with every bite.

for the main star, we order the homemade sausage with carmelied onions and chili oil pizza... No tomatoes but I was fine with that. The first bite was by far the biggest relief ever, as the cheese melted and the crust was everything I imagined in a thin crust. we both ate happily and added more chili oil to heat up eat bite of our slice. Even the crust was doughy!

we saved just enough room for dessert and as much as I wanted to try the affogato, we ordered the lemon panna cotta with cranberry sauce. This is the softest pc I have ever tasted, with a burst of lemon in each bite, and the sweet and slightly tart cranberry compote. It was a good size for sharing although I wish I had my own.

There is not one bad thing I can say about this place. I was scared that my expectations would be too high going in and would be miserably disappointed but it was even better than I could have imagined. I can only hope that the next time I come that line ups won't be too long and pizza is just as good... Cant wait!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and finally made it for lunch on a Friday. Did not have to wait and got seated right away. Overall the food was very good. We opted for the lunch special which for $15 got us a salad, pizza, and dessert. Also, the staff was amazing - very friendly and helpful. The manager took my kids to show them the wood burning oven and even lent them t-shirts to take pictures in. Kids had a lot of fun. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I didnt know that this place was owned by the owner of Silver Spoon on Roncesvalles.  I happen to have met the owner, Rocco, before at Silver Spoon and he was especially warm and conscientious.  In fact I remember going there once and having some freebie app - probably just a simple bruschette or something at the bar while i was waiting to be seated.  

Cue segue: so i have been waiting in line for somewhere between an hour and a half to get a table at Libretto, and before I expand on the texture of that hour or so, i will qualify the experience with a couple of things: i was in a group of 8 people, which makes it generally harder to get seated.  secondly, i was with my wife's parents who are probably used to a less lax approach to service, as they usually go to restaurants that are perhaps more expensive than this one.  Now that done, I should say that the service was pretty dismal.  I dont really understand the no reservations policy - i suppose it's there to create a mystique.  if so, then you better damn well make sure that EVERYONE, especially the people that have COMMITTED  to waiting over an hour for a seat, should feel at ease and continue to want to wait it out.  The hostess was a rattled and passive girl who never offered any drinks (until we demanded to know what was going on), or food, consolation, or information as to her plan of action (with regards to getting us a table).  It simply is bad form and bad business.  The waiter seemed like he was stoned or simply indifferent - if you are going to clear a plate, you dont shove your arm in front of someones face and take it, you ask if its okay, wait, get the okay and then take it.

NOW, all that aside.  The food was DELICIOUS.  i had a lovely pizza with duck confit, pears and some great cheese.  I shared a couple salads - the best of which was with smoked tofu slices, some incredible dressing...Everyone, thankfully, seemed to enjoy their pizzas.  The only glitch was a plate of ravioli that my sister-in-law ordered which had about 8 pieces - a bit chintzy for 15 bucks.  

I found interestingly that they are going for a Terroni feel (another well known Italian restaurant in Toronto).  Everything from the materials used to design the place, to the look of the bartenders, to the napkins, to the no reservations, screamed Terroni's.  

If these guys gave as much care to the their service as their food itd be a stellar place.  That said, i would, if i was in the area, definitely go back, but  probably not when i know itd be really busy."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, one for lunch with the office during the week and the second time was a warm summer Friday evening ( around 5:45 pm ) after some shopping.  We got a table inside straight away and everyone enjoyed their food. We had the Margherita pizza, meatballs and I had the home made sausage but asked for the chili oil to be left out. 

The food, from all accounts, was good. We shared two desserts, the brownie with ice cream and honey and the coffee with vanilla ice cream. Again, all were delicious. Service was prompt and friendly and surprisingly even when the restaurant started filling up it was not noisy, perhaps we didn't stay late enough for the partiers to show up or maybe it's because the ceilings are high!   

We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Really love the decor at this restaurant, especially their lights! Also the big windows create the ideal lighting for taking photos. 

We ordered the fried calamari, octopus carpaccio and the featured pizza. Overall everything was decent.

My favourite is the calamari! Although it was fried it wasn't oily at all. The octopus carpaccio was sliced so thinly that I could barely taste anything. 

Pizza was soggy..which I really didn't like. All their pizzas are 12\" and will end up being really filling. It was a good idea that we ordered only one pizza for the 3 of us to share."}
{"text":"I recently visited this pizzeria thanks to Lambert's UYE hosting. It was an excellent call as I never would have visited it had not been for this opportunity.

We were a large group, close to 20, so service was matched to accommodate our group (at times too slow for my liking, but it's a group and you gotta roll with it, right?). We were extremely lucky that in spite of asking for separate bills, we were not adding the instant gratuity!

I ordered the Ontario prosciutto and arugula - a tomato based pizza. It was large and despite having a healthy lunch, I managed to eat it all! It is that delicious! I love crust, and this one had a puffy crust. Prosciutto was generously spread all over the pizza, as well as an equally portion of arugula topped it off! No regrets.

I ordered the 4oz Muskoka cream ale and it paired well with it, despite it not being a recommended pairing.

My other dinner companions also enjoyed their pizza and I was told this was a certified Neopolitan pizzeria with ingredients flown in from Italy! Pretty impressive stuff."}
{"text":"This place is quaint. VERY quaint. Basically it's a hallway with tables. Helped with the atmosphere though.

I went with 8 people and showed up before the rush. Luckily for me seating was a breeze and I got to try every pizza on the menu. Pizza's were thin crust, crispy on the outside, and just slightly chewy on the inside. Perfection to me! 

Gotta stick with the traditional pizza's in this place though (pruscuitto and margherita) as the other more \"experimental\" pizzas were too one dimensional. Too cheesy(Duck), oily(Sausage), salty(Mushroom), or cheesy(Salami). The margherita and pruscuitto were great in comparison to the other pizzas. Although on their own, I would say it's good.

Wait staff great, our waitress was very nice, happy, and accommodating albeit in a rush. 

Overall Pizzeria Libretto was a great experience and I recommend everyone go at least once. The prices are a little high for a personal pizza but you're paying for the ambiance and that imported oven, tastes great. I'm sure I will go again... someday."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER.  They cook it Napoli-style for 90 seconds in a really hot oven, so the crust is crispy and delicious.  Great variety of toppings and high quality ingredients.  I ordered the duck confit pizza which was quite good, but my boyfriend's choice was superior - one of the prosciutto options.  It tasted like heaven in pizza form.  Noisy atmosphere and very busy but well worth the wait (which was only 10 minutes, not bad).  I will definitely return here next time I'm in Toronto.  The only bad thing is the pizza is so delicious you will eat it all and then not have any room for all the delicious-looking desserts!"}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place being starving.. was a bit hesitant as NYC pizza rules.  This place would rank right along with Roberta's and almost Motorino.  The crust was chewy and bubbly and the toppings were excellent.  I've been missing eggplant on my thin crust pizzas.  The cremini mushroom pizza was great as well.  Loved the decor and service was great.  What a cutie pie waiter!"}
{"text":"So I love, LOVE both Pizzeria Libretto's on danforth and on ossington. So why not stop by the one on university as well? 

Maybe it's just this one experience, but I found the service here to be quite.. Not there. 

We walked roughly half an hour before our waitress came to take our order, and even longer for food, and even more longer for our check (don't they want us to leave after eating?!). 

Of course the food itself was a beaut, it always was. 

Sardines: I loooooove the salty bits of fish mixed with the slightly sweet tomato sauce. Pick this one if you love sardines (obviously, BUT ITS ACTUALLY SO GOOD). It's one of my fave dishes and its kid of sad but I've tried almost all of them.

Overall, I would avoid coming to this Pizzeria Libretto and go to another one (also it's super crowded because it's smack downtown). But the quality is still deliciously the same as the others."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best places for pizza in Toronto! The only thing is that Queen Margarita is my first and my favourite and I will stay loyal (although it's hard to...).

Definitely try to get a reservation! The place gets packed pretty quickly and the chances you'll get a seat during dinner without waiting half an hour is unlikely. It's totally worth it though.

It's actually quite a large restaurant too,and it's really lively. There are seats near the front where you can see out onto the street which are my favourite of the restaurant. 

Margherita D.O.P: Classic Margherita done right. it's served in a thin crust pizza (I think all of them are) with the perfect amount of mozzerella. 

Grilled Eggplant (Tomato, Basil, Chili Flakes, Ricotta Salata): A little bit spicy that adds a kick to the savory eggplant on the pizza. Just perfect. 

Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula (Garlic, Tomato, Oregano, Shaved Grana Padano): The Prosciutto covers the entire pizza (kind of all comes off after the first two bites...) but delicious. 

The service is very friendly, and the one great thing about thin crust Neapolitan pizza is that it always comes out FAST. I've been here several times, even when it's a full house and I always get my pizza within 15 minutes of ordering. 

Great service and even better food. Of course I would come again if I was in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed...
Went here thinking the pizza was going to be out of this world... Definitely didn't hold up to all the reviews on here. Sometimes I wonder who's really writing these reviews on Yelp lol

Anyways, we ordered the meatballs to start. The meatballs were super moist, flavourful and delicious. Unfortunately we couldn't say the same about the pizza... A nice thin crust but hardly any sauce and rather boring. 

For some reason we had to wait close to an hour for our pizzas... when apparently they only take 90 seconds to bake? Everyone around us were getting their orders a lot faster. The waiter said it was because the place was busy... Bullish!t

I left there beyond disappointed and definitely will not be returning.

Also... You have to leave a 15% tip...
This place is a joke"}
{"text":"I come here often for weekday lunches and I am a very big fan.

The pizza is consistently good and well priced. 

They offer a prix fixed lunch menu where you can get a salad, a margarita pizza, and dessert for $15. You can substitute the pizza for any other pizza from their menu for an additional $5.

Their salads are good, their pizzas are good, their desserts, service, drinks and atmosphere are all good too. 

I would highly recommend Libretto and I would also recommend making reservations as they will have longline ups."}
{"text":"What's better then a pizza for two? A pizza for one!!!! 

I had high expectations for this cute pizzeria as I have heard a lot of great things. I ate outside on the patio and it was beautiful with the red chairs and wood table tops I felt as if I were in Italy. I ordered from the Pizza Bianca menu and ate the most delicious Roasted Cremini Mushroom  Mozzarella Di Bufula, Gorgonzola, Pecorino, Roasted Garlic, Brown Butter, Thyme, Rosemary pizza. The restaurant had great service and my pizza order and cook time was no more than 10 minutes. 

The pizza was delicious I literally could have eaten the whole thing. The crust was crispy and the mushrooms were so juicy creating a wonderful balance. There really isn't anything to complain about, and the price paid was well worth it. I would go back in a heart beat, but next time I would be sure to try one of their many desserts :)"}
{"text":"I came in not knowing anything about this place, the prices, menu, restaurant name, etc. I didn't even know it was a hyped up place.

We ordered a variety of pizzas. The Duck confit pizza (recommended by a friend) was superb. Their pizza is pretty good, it's freshly made and hot when served. I just felt it was missing something, like seasoning or olive oil.
I enjoyed the calamari the most.
The dessert and icecream were delicious!

By the way, they have the BEST SERVICE and amazing employees. 5/5 for these guys.

It was a good experience, I would have expected more for the price we paid. I think I dropped here $50 for dinner."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is as stupid good as everyone else says it is. I'm not even sure what I can add to all the reviews already posted. It's a nice spot, the staff are really friendly, and the food is un-fucking-believable. My god, it's so damn good. The place is stupid busy, so you may end up having to wait a while for a seat if you aren't lucky. My advice is to head down to the restaurant right after work if you want to eat before the place fills up. You can usually head to the bar across the street and get a pint to drink while you wait."}
{"text":"People have been going mental for this place ever since it opened. I would walk by several times and see the place packed with people standing outside waiting for a table. There are so many options in this city for food that having to wait an hour for a table just seems ridiculous, but I finally had an opportunity to eat here last night.

We did in fact have to wait an hour for a table (for 8) but when you're with a group it's no big deal. We went elsewhere for a drink and the restaurant called us when the table was ready. This was near the end of their night so they had run out of the first two wine choices we asked for. Not a big deal I suppose. The appetizers started to arrive and I have to say I was floored by how delicious they were. Had some sort of bruschetta and thought I was going to orgasm on the spot.

Now the main course: the pizza. I order the most expensive one on the menu (wild mushroom) but because it was part of a $25 dollar combo it was all good. The pizza was so-so. I was kind of disappointed given how good the appetizers were. Everyone at the table shared slices so I got to sample some other flavours and they were pretty good, but again I was not totally impressed. I am not a pizza connoisseur or anything but I didn't like that the crust was basically soggy. I like my pizza to be crispy and not flop when you pick it up. Especially when it comes to thin crust.

Service was alright. There seemed to be a lot of people working and randomly walking around yet it took a bit of effort to order another drink. Bill was astronomical but there were 8 people after all. To be honest I would have been happier going to the burger spot across the street."}
{"text":"The mushroom pizza is life. This place is always buzzing, with great service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Must say, what made this place special, aside from the good pizza and the incredible tiramisu, was the service. We had a bit of a wait on a Saturday evening, about 20 minutes, which we killed by walking around the area waiting for a text from their hostess. Got the text, went back and grabbed two seats at the bar. 

Happened to be served by the nicest guy possible and sat next to one of the managers, mark, which had just gotten finished his shift and stayed to eat. 

Service was quick, welcoming and very friendly. Made us both feel at home and truly part of the fabric. 

Last - they sell their server tshirts. I know it may sound silly, but for $20 each they are actually amazingly soft and well fitted American apparel shirts."}
{"text":"im a regular here - despite the long wait as they don't take reservations, this place is worth it. Try to go mid week to avoid the weekend crowds. i can never get enough grilled eggplant pizza with a nice glass of Montepulciiano and end the evening with their mouth watering Tiramisu - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had the nduja pizza on the recommendation of previous post and thought it was fantastic. Flavour of the dough actually reminded me of my summers in Italy. They got everything right, flavour, consistency and doneness. The fried calamari was good but not great, slightly over fried and a little chewy. Apparently the gluten free crust is indistinguishable from the real deal."}
{"text":"i don't usually like pizza....yet libretto is my top five fav restos in t.o.

Best pizza/spicy oil EVER. YUMMMMMMM. Just go."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto has really great Italian pizza that feels authentic with really fresh ingredients and amazing dough. The place has great vibes and seems like a diverse place where you could bring friends, family or a date. The buttermilk fried calamari with romesco sauce is pretty good and ending with the tiramisu was he perfect dessert. I've tried three of their pizzas here: the Cremini Mushroom, Duck Confit and Libretto Margherita. All were terrific and super fresh. Definitely recommend for a fancy pizza night."}
{"text":"No flavor.....soggy in middle....everyone was dosing their pizza with the chilly oil.  Over priced."}
{"text":"I came yesterday( the day the blue jays lost to the Yankees) to this place with some friends to check it out for the first time. I ordered the house made sausage and a pint of there special beer. I really liked the pizza it was thin and tasty but the beer not so much I had. Way better beers. The place is very fancy and. Nice to sit and have a meal but the main withdrew is the price. The place is so pricy for pizza like I got the pizza for 16 dollar for 12\" any other place u will get the party size pizza for that price . and they only have one size pizza which sucks."}
{"text":"They have a surprisingly memorable kale salad for a pizza place. AND the pizza is good too."}
{"text":"Everyone has been raving about Pizzeria Libretto so I took my open minded palate down to Ossington for a slice.  

First off, rumoured waits of 30- 45 minutes are accurate which is okay for a restaurant with so much hype.  My issue is the whole timing of the dining experience.  After the wait, our waiter came right up and poured drinks and took our order.  No more then 10 minutes after we ordered our pizza and salad, did the waiter return with our food.  

Now fast food is great when you are with kids or at McDonalds actually expecting to be served in under 10 minutes, but at a restaurant like this, the pizza should be coming out piping hot and with enough time between my order and when it is served that I believe as a patron that you took the time in your kitchen to make it from scratch.  The pizza was luke warm and the tofu artichoke salad was four small slices of smoked tofu with two tiny artichokes and lettuce doused in dressing for $9.  I was floored. 

The interior decor is funky and tables are close together - a bit hard if you want to have a conversation with the person you are dining with.  
I would not rush back to Libretto.  I am faithful to Lil Baci on Queen East for making some of the best Neapolitan Pizza in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this location - no more trips to Little Italy! I was happy to find that the food remained the same quality as the original location. I personally liked their appetizers more than the pizzas (I prefer thick pan pizzas). Strongly recommend the arugula salad & buttermilk calamari. Service was quick as we arrive quite late into the evening. The price was fair given the quality of the food super convenient location."}
{"text":"Flank Steak Spiedini - flavorful and tender steak; sourdough bread soaked up all the oils and flavors. Warning - pretty burnt. 

Pizza was overhyped. They were not served hot enough, borderline cold. Dough is wet so that the toppings slide off when you pick it up with your hands (that's why eat with fork & knife). I never met a mushroom pizza I didn't like, but this one lacked mushroom flavor (and mushrooms were on the dry side) and was overpowered by the gorgonzola. I preferred the Housemade Sausage - the caramelized onions gave it a nice sweet flavor, but again it was not hot enough. 

Tiramisu - cream was tasty but overall too soaked and strong in alcohol"}
{"text":"Ok, I haven't really been here enough to have a good handle on the overall quality of the food, but from what I have had here, it's worthy of three stars.

Friends and I had just gorged ourselves on delicious pho from Pho Tien Thanh down the street, and were heading up to College to catch the street car back home but were still hungry so....we stopped off to try Libretto. We ordered a medium Marguerite and it was tasty, prepared in good time and fresh....but it was just kind of pedestrian. I know people love this place and it's the church of pizza to them, but it was just okay. It didn't change my life or make me see God. It was just okay. And listen, I get it. It was one pizza, take-out, and I had just eaten and wasn't hungry, and by no means am I saying it wasn't good, it just wasn't GREAT.

Staff was very friendly though, great atmosphere and clean bathrooms (gotta' make sure you have clean hands to eat!), but I wasn't blown away.

Still, worth trying out, and still worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This location of Pizzeria Libretto just opened on 10-Nov-2014 and despite being only open for two days in the heart of downtown Toronto, I was able to quickly get a table for my wife and I.  

For our meal, we ordered the meatball appetizer and the Ndula Sausage Pizza.  The meatballs were delicious and so was the tomato sauce that it came in.  The only thing I would probably say against it was that it was tad heavy on the garlic, but still very delicious.

The Ndula sausage pizza was awesome and the crust was cooked to perfection.  The was a little crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, and the ingredients and toppings were fresh and delicious.

The servers were extremely friendly, courteous and efficient.

Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I just don't get what all the hype is about when you've got places like Regina's, The Standard Club, Vivoli, hell, even Bitondo's, within a half kilometer radius. 

Firstly, for an oven that's supposed to bake a pizza in 90 seconds, it sure did take a while for us to receive our food. We didn't get our pizzas until an hour after ordering. Not exaggerating.  When they finally did get to our table, the toppings were barely cooked and the cheese was hardly melted. Wtf? The leftovers tasted so much better served hot after we reheated them in the oven at home. Also, the so-called \"anchovy\" pizza had a whopping total of 5 tiny anchovies on it -- so chincy!! The pizza's aren't cheap either. And the service was horrible. Our waitress was so robotic and impersonal...didn't make eye contact with any of us. I get better service at a Tim Horton's for gods sake...

I shared this experience with an friend who was born and raised in Italy, and she agreed that Pizza Libretto is all hype. All the power to those who actually enjoy this place. I won't be back though..."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner on recent vacation to Toronto. My girlfriend and I had awesome Margherita pizza that was fresh and perfect. Could've used a little more juice but I guess that's what's expected. Best part was the meatball appetizer. Never had meatballs that were as good as Libretto's. Wish they had those offered on a pizza or as a main dish with pasta. Service was awesome to top"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate this place doesn't take reservations, because this could have been a 4-star review. Not that it really matters, however, considering I'm throwing this into a pool of 75+ reviews and counting.

I really don't understand the no reservation policy, though. It's as frustrating for the wait staff to have to phone and follow up with patrons forced to wander the local Ossington strip aimlessly while they wait for a table, as it is for the actual patrons waiting for the call. It IS pizza after all. The only reason I can muster for continuing on like this is to simply reinforce the hype here, which is not reason enough for me.

Yes, the pizzas are authentically Neapolitan, having sampled the Italian fare myself, but even they weren't worth waiting an hour for. I personally prefer crispier thin crusts over gooey centers, but I do appreciate the buffalo mozzarella and quality ingredients. The margherita pizza, the pizza by which all real pizzerias should be judged, was on par with some of the better versions I've had, but the homemade sausage and chili oil pizza one of my companions ordered was above average.

All in all, good, but not 45 minutes-1 hour good."}
{"text":"I guess you have to be a hipster to like this place... 
The ambiance was nice, though it was so loud we had to yell just to have a conversation. The wait staff seem like they couldn't care less about you, unless you're a certain kind of customer...
We had to wait for about 30 mins before the pizzas finally arrived, and they were disappointing. All charred and burnt around the edges but soggy and gross in the middle. Is this what passes for \"good\" pizza in the city? I'd rather just have takeout then..."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pizza but the pizza here is great. 

We tried 3 different kinds of pizza, the classic margherita (with extra cheese, of course), the duck and pear (AMAZING, must try) and whatever was on special which was a little underwhelming. But nevertheless, great. 

For starters, we shared the calamari which was really good, and the Rocco salad. It was really good too with a deep fried egg on top, but the portion was a bit small. I sent a pic to my friend and she told me her portion was double the size last time! Rude!

Service was quick and friendly, and the d√©cor was nice and clean. Definitely would come back here for pizza!"}
{"text":"This is excellent Neapolitan pizza. 

Thin, chewy crust with a touch of sweetness....fresh, flavorful toppings....slightly burnt edges...just the way it is in Napoli. 

I wonder if they use special filtered water, and special flour....my guess is they do. 

So far, this is the best pizza I've found in Toronto. Worth fighting the traffic for."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious craving inducing crust, fun flavourful toppings, and great drinks!  Very popular spot, with an often short wait.  Many great nearby bars to help kill some time."}
{"text":"This was the closest pizza place near the airbnb spot I was staying at. It has a cute outdoor seating with decorated lights and plenty of seating inside. 

I ordered To-Go an Eggplant pizza and a Prosciutto Pizza. 

The Eggplant and cheese on the pizza was amazing! Perfect ratio for each bite. The dough was a bit soggy though, most likely due to the weight of the toppings. 

The Prosciutto was good as well. They lay the meat over the pizza after it's been cut so you have to re-cut the pizza again. There were also some burnt spots on the dough."}
{"text":"Nice spacious seating, friendly service and I was pretty happy with the food I ordered. We had the beef carpaccio, meatballs, cauliflower, libretto salad as our appetizers, they were all really good. The libretto marguerita was too cheesy for me, wish I went with the traditional. And the white anchovy pizza was very tangy which I liked but my husband thought it was really salty. And their meat pizza was very satisfying indeed. So if you have craving for thin crust pizza, Libretto will hit the spot."}
{"text":"I walked into there on an afternoon to a pretty sparse restaurant. We had ordered the kale salad and special pizza of the day, (some fancy variety of ham, some fancy variety of cheese, crimini mushrooms, and truffle paste)

The pizza was pretty soggy due to the mushrooms, and fell apart. The pizza was a pretty underwhelming considering it was $18. The ham tasted just like ham, and the cheese was just like cheese.

The kale salad was actually pretty good. For $11 it had a nice dressing with roasted chickpeas on it which added a nice texture.

Overall it was over-hyped and over-priced. When splitting this among two people this came to almost $25 per person (with drinks)"}
{"text":"Ah trendy places, how I love and hate you.  I came here with a group of 8 for my birthday dinner.  Step 1 was to place my name in long before I actually wanted to eat, as they don't take reservations.  I was given a time of 1.5-2 hours.  Around 1 hour, I started getting calls that they had a table, but they worked with me to delay a bit.

The FOOD: Pretty darn good pizzas first of all.  A trick I learned is to order them \"well-done\".  Even ordering them well-done, I still found them a bit underdone in the middle.  Something isn't quite working for them with the pizza oven.  

Everyone loved the Nduja sausage and the cremini mushroom pizzas.  The duck confit pizza only sort of worked....didn't taste as good as it sounded.  All our pizzas were $17.  The spiducci flank steak appetizer was awesome.  The gnocchi friti were also pretty tasty.  Dessert was pretty forgettable.

The DRINKS: I'm kind of underwhelmed by their drink offerings.  Why do they have such boring beer on tap when they're so close to Bellwoods?  Wines are decent, but not great and priced a bit on the high side.

SERVICE was generally pretty good on my two visits.  The servers have been friendly and patient....also pretty attentive.  Despite it being a crowded night, I didn't feel like anyone was rushing us. The front desk people are a mixed bag...especially when you're trying to work with them to accommodate a big group.  They simply just need to take reservations for groups larger than 6.

The AMBIANCE is crowded and loud.  Not a lot of ambiance here unless you like shouting at your neighbours.

OVERALL, it's a cool place to come for pretty good pizza.  I don't think I'll ever try to get a big group in here again...that was just way too stressful trying to time it."}
{"text":"Making pizza involves a narrow range of ingredients that can be manipulated in careful and subtle ways to produce a staggering variety of results.  I'm fascinated by what different chefs accomplish with variations on the medium, and on how they're able to distinguish themselves.  In Pizzeria Libretto's case, I'm a huge fan of the unique texture of the dough, which can best be described as \"elastic\" -- you'll have to try it to grasp what I mean.  The red sauce is light and lively, there are some tasty and thought provoking combos -- my favourite being the sardines with citrus-marinated olives -- and the interior is mod and bright.  There are nearly as many pizza palates as there are pizza recipes, but if you are a fan of the mozzarella m√©tier, this place is certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"Did a pickup order and as usual the pizza was so delicious.  Placed order via phone and was ready as promised.  Server made sure all order was correct (which I have never seen before).  We ordered pepperoni, spicy and special of the day - all done perfectly.  Will check in next rime I'm there."}
{"text":"In a town that loves pizza and has a major pizza chain for every day of the week, Pizzeria Libretto carries the mantle as the belle of the ball when it comes to pizza.

The pizza here is delicious, yet the options are not limitless. Libretto works to serve only pizza that meets the highest standards for real pizza. everything from cooking temperature to the type of organic tomatoes are carefully regulated. While there is uniqueness here, you won't find lots of odd-ball toppings or variety in thickness/texture.

The best way to do this is to arrive early (even before five if you can). It does get very crowded here at peak evening and weekend times.

If you do find yourself waiting a while, there are some good neighbourhood bars nearby, and the staff will call you when your table is ready.

Finally, service here exceeds expectations. Many places in town that have a good product don't seem to have or care about good service. That is not the case here. Even though the waiters won't have long to chat, they are on the ball with explanations, refills, and general politeness. 

In a town that prizes the latest and greatest of everything, Libretto is becoming that classic, established Toronto Pizza place that is the go-to place for great pizza."}
{"text":"Location : great downtown in the financial district. No parking but great for local workers. 

Food:
Delicious!
I ordered the arugula salad. This contained pears and a light dressing. 
I also ordered the Cacciatore Salami pizza. 
Tasted great however it was salty due to the salami. 

Atmosphere: decent. Very much like a diner setting. Nothing that stood out in the venue. 

Service: decent, again nothing extra. Wait time average. 

Overall I would visit this place again but I would definitely get another type of pizza."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with two coworkers on a Monday at 11:30am, right when the restaurant opened. The restaurant is spacious and has high ceilings, lots of windows, and a sizable patio for those who want a breeze. I ordered the Prix Fixe for lunch, shared with a female coworker. It came with an arugula salad, margarita pizza, and an espresso cinnamon gelato. The salad was fresh and delicately dressed. I loved the Parmesan shavings and pear slices in the salad. The pizza was super thin and had a very tasty tomato sauce (probably around 12\" wide). We ended the meal with a large scoop of gelato - the espresso was just strong enough with a hint of cinnamon. The waitress was very friendly and made sure our glasses were filled. I would definitely return again and am quite excited to try the Ossington location as well."}
{"text":"The arancinis are a great way to start off the meal. The little balls of smooth risotto is stuffed with so much cheese that it strings apart when you go to cut it open. They are not large, but you get three golf ball-sized spheres in one dish. We added a forth for an extra $3, and it became a substantial appetizer for two people. It was surprisingly filling even after only two of them. Great tomato sauce on the bottom brought the right amount of acidity to this rich dish.

The second dish was unfortunately disappointing for me. The duck confit pizza, which is part of the mealshare program (very admirable, a great social program!), but I found the pizza incredibly dry. The crust itself was well charred from the oven and had a good texture. However, the mix of toppings (duck confit, bosc pear, mozzarella) didn't bring enough moistness at all. Every bite was dry, no matter which bite of topping I got. It desperately needed some type of sauce to help balance it out. I couldn't even finish one slice....which just made me sad. Will definitely avoid this pizza and try something else on their pizza list next time."}
{"text":"Went to Libretto for a going away lunch for a couple of coworkers. I have been to Libretto in Danforth before and thought it was an awesome pie and therefore had high expectations. Came in early to ensure to get a seat. I like their decor. Very contemporary and their booths were quite comfortable. My coworkers had the 3 course fixed price meal while I digressed and had the duck confit since it is part of their mealshare. Started off with their bread and I wish they just served me the rosemary sourdough bread all meal. That was good. Soft and just enough sour. Paired with the balsamic vinegar/olive oil dip they had made it just amazing. The pizza arrived and my first bite I thought was ok. I was not a big fan of the big slices of pear considering it took over most of the taste. I like the rosemary, but found myself taking out some pieces of pear. Maybe next time I will just stick with the savoury. They seem to do well with their Margherita pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian style pizza! A taste of Italy is definitely here. My favourite is the diavlo pizza, nice and spicy. Also you have to try their fried gnocchi. Simply amazing! Definitely the best pizza restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I love this place. 
A co-worker of mine had recommended this place to me as the best pie in town right after we returned from Europe and were craving the real Italian Pizza we ate in the Florence region. I'm so glad he did, coz ever since then we boycotted all other pizza.
I find the Danforth location suits us better, since you can book a reservation online and it is much more roomier, however Ossington works too when we are around that area. 
Just as everyone recommended, yes, the Margherita Pizza is all you want to eat. We've tried the other daily special as well as others on the menu, but I keep coming back to Margherita. I however didn't like it any better with buffalo mozzarella. I preferred the standard they have on the menu.
Oh, and one time we tried these gnocci bites they had as a special (I forget the name now) absolutely delish.
Always good, but most importantly always CONSISTENTLY good. Just writing this review (its been long overdue) makes me wanna go again !!"}
{"text":"Great food, ok service, sucky prices

We ordered the calamari for starters and it was really tasty and crunchy but I could do without the sauce at the bottom, it was a little to sweet for me. I like a savoury sauce to go with my savoury app. The pizza that we ordered was the sausage with straciattela cheese and it was really tasty I must admit! 
The affogato was strong and robust and the donut was tge highlight of my dinner. The sauce was fruity and it cuts through the sweetness of the donuts. The price is a bit ridiculous being 4 slices for a thin crust pizza for 17 bucks!! 

I would go back but it wouldn't be my top choice"}
{"text":"short wait on a Saturday (20 mins) is always a great place to start.

Every single person we interacted with was lovely, and attentive. You cannot ask for more than that.

The restaurant was buzzing when we arrived at 9ish. Good vibe, staff looked to be having a great time. 

We ordered Caprese salad & Calamari to start and 2 pizzas for our main.

Calamari was fantastic, better than average (for battered calamari) with a larger than average portion, also great. Odd that there was no accompanying sauce (aoili at least?)

Caprese - This is a very, very poor and somewhat sad version of this Italian standard. Enormous thick slices of Beefsteak tomatoes inter cut with small thin slices of bocconcini. The ratio was off. The markup on the ingredients is assinine - from roughly 80 cents for the tomato and $1 for the bocconcini used to over $10. Very little olive oil, basil. No salt, pepper, oregano or dried seasoning of any sort. This menu item deserves better. This is Chef Boyardee in its overall presentation. 

The dough/crust on the 2 pizza was delightful - top quality. Didn't love the sauce, absolutely missing key spices and/or some salt. Objectively speaking the cheese is sub par. The fresh bocconcini isnt to the standard that should be used for a stone over pizza. Thank god the basil was there to help in our pizza's time of need."}
{"text":"Solid place. Always enjoy the food and the service. I have an Italian friend who says the pizza is overrated; well, I'm not Italian, so I can't comment on that. It's the best pizza I have ever had."}
{"text":"Stuck with a trusty margherita pizza as I always do.

DO IT. JUST DO IT (as Shia Labeouf would say). Stop reading this review RIGHT NOW and head over to Pizzeria Libretto. Get a pizza. Put the chili oil on it. Eat it. Start crying at how great it is.

I had to wait a while to get a seat but honestly didn't mind because the pizza was just wow - my mouth is watering right now."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after wanting to go for ages (but wanting to stay out of Hipsterville a.k.a. Ossington location). I've been here twice (at this particular location).

We sat at the bar, bartender was friendly. It was a weekday, so we totally scored with the Prix Fix ($15 for a salad, pizza and dessert!). There were basically two options for each course so we ordered one of each. Both salads were great - though I tended to like the arugula a bit more. My favourite was a fantastic Marinara (flavourful basil, garlic, fantastic tomato sauce and no cheese - yay for not having to compromise discomfort for flavour!). I had the basil sorbet - fantastic! Second time I had the espresso gelato - wonderful! Both pizzas were excellent! 

Second time the server took the time to explain to us about the pizza and lots of little details we didn't know on our first visit, so that was much appreciated.

This is my go-to pizza place, fo sho (just open one in the Annex, k? Thanks!)"}
{"text":"Come here if you're looking for a nice dinner with authentic Neapolitan pizza. We have eaten here twice, and both times we left almost nothing on our plates. The pizza is thin in the center and thicker on the outsides, with really fresh tasting sauce and yummy crust. They usually have a pizza special, which is what I got last time. It was a pepper and spicy salami pizza, and it had just the right amount of kick to it.

We also had the Rocco's salad: Crispy Egg, Butternut Squash, Heirloom Beets, Pine Nuts, Pingue Prosciutto. This was pretty good, fresh with good flavor. The egg was ok, but didn't add as much flavor to the salad as I thought. The prosciutto was really good though!

It's a popular place, so I would recommend making a reservation if you're going during busy times."}
{"text":"By the core downtown area of Financial District, this pizzeria serves some delicious thin crust pizzas! I had a chance to try their duck and smoked salmon pizza which came up about $18 per pizza. I shared it with my friends and for sure the pizza portions are more for a single person than for sharing.

Nonetheless, we went during lunch time and it was packed! Waited for about 30 minutes before we were able to get a seat - not sure if they take reservations during the lunch hour but highly recommend to call in and try to if anyone is planning on coming during the lunch time. Very nice servers and the pizza came in a timely manner.

I have not tried their dinner service before but I do not have doubts that it will be pretty good as well. Also not sure if the dinner menus pricing will change because of dinner service."}
{"text":"So I had made what I thought was a reservation for this location, but it turns out I had reserved at the King Street location. The hostess was completely unfazed by this, however, since I guess it happens all the time, and she showed us to a comfortable booth near the back.

We decided to start with the Arugula Salad (\"Pear, Walnut, Piave, Ontario Gamay Vinaigrette\") and I was a little worried that it might be too plain. Plain is the last word I would use to describe this dish. It's actually pretty incredible and impressively layered with flavors, as the pear, walnet, and piave prove an ideal complement to the arugula. The vinaigrette is just about perfect, too.

For our main, we went with the Diavola pizza (\"Tomato, Spicy Salami, Mozzarella Di Bufala, Chili, Onion, Kalamata Olives\"). It's superb. Everything worked well here, from the plentiful, delicious toppings to the perfectly-cooked crust to the rich, zesty tomato sauce. I can honestly say I enjoyed this pizza more than I was expecting, and I was absolutely expecting to love it."}
{"text":"After catching a movie at the Lightbox, we were in the mood for a nice, hearty dinner. My dinner companion had recently watched a Netflix series about pizza, so Pizzeria Libretto was a no-brainer.

We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday night and the place was predictably crowded, though we were instantly able to snag a spot at the bar. Rather than just order a pizza each, we decided to share a few things:

Prosciutto di Parma (\"grissini, seasonal accompaniments\"): This was simply several slices of prosciutto served with three breadsticks and a small dish of pickled veggies. The prosciutto is pretty amazing and probably ranks among the best I've ever had, while the breadsticks and veggies were both quite tasty.

Buttermilk Fried Calamari (\"Romesco (a red pepper almond sauce)\"): The highlight of the meal, this definitely blows most fried calamari dishes out of the water. The calamari themselves were fried perfectly, and the accompanying sauce was so addictive I was sopping up what was left with the complimentary bread (which was, by the way, also quite good). The only complaint with this one was that it wasn't served as quickly as it should've been (i.e. the dish wasn't piping hot).

Margherita (\"Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella\"): Ironically, the pizza was the weakest dish we ate. The toppings were just so-so and the crust, though pleasingly charred around the edges, was unreasonably soggy the closer you got to the middle of the pizza. For comparison, my dining companion had just returned from a trip to Italy, where he ate a number of Margherita 'zas, and he called this version of the venerable dish \"garbage.\""}
{"text":"Decided to try out this pizza joint but couldn't resist having their apps before we got to the actual pizza.

Ordered the beet salad - fresh and came with soft cheese. A good combo in taste and texture.

Arancini - deep fried rice ball with cheese inside accompanied with tomato sauce. This was OK in my opinion. I feel like cheaper pizza joints make better arancinis than this one where it feels like it's missing something.

Gnocchi - with tomato sauce and cottage cheese (?). This one was my boyfriends favourite amongst the apps. Not the greatest pasta but was worth eating. 

Calamari - my fave amongst the 4 apps... a little too crispy batter, which hurt my mouth when chewing but the squid was so tender meaning fresh ingredients :) the sauce that comes with it completes it all!! Recommended! 

Pizza - we had the spicy one (forgot name). The crust was the best part... nice chewy crunchy crust. Makes you crave the creamy garlic dip from pizza pizza. The toppings and sauce are very different from typical pizza joints. Very fresh and well accommodating with the actual bread. 

The desserts are AMAZING. Had 3 desserts: Tiramisu, affogato, and the Panna cotta. All three were equally delicious. Must have them on your visit here. 

Also, the service is typical. Kind and welcoming."}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. My coworkers tell me this place serves the best authentic Italian pizza in Toronto. So naturally I need to give it a try.

I ordered the daily special pizza which included cheese, cheese, more cheese, roasted garlic, chard, and sausage. The pizza when I got it looked more like an oval to me, the crust was slightly burnt, and the toppings fell apart when I was cutting it. I'm not Italian and I don't claim to know what authentic Italian pizza tastes like but I'm pretty sure it shouldn't taste like a mouthful of burnt crust. The pizza dough was soft and well made but the burnt taste just ruined it for me.

This is one of the fancier pizza places I've been to. Very good service and no complaints here.

The pizza I ordered was around $20. The size wasn't extremely big but it's enough to fill one up for the meal. However, for that pricing I wished there was a little more.

Maybe it was the hype or maybe I was just served a poor pizza but I didn't enjoy the pizza as much as I wanted. Hopefully I will have a better experience the next time I visit. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Yum! A $15 lunch prix fixe has got to be the best deal in town: a full size appetizer, full size pizza, and a dessert! WOW!
Party of four shared: 
- 2 bruschetta (different bruschetta - both fantastic)
- 1 arugula salad with pear and parmesan (refreshingly delicious)
- 1 beet caprese (underwhelming... I like beets and I like caprese, but not together as much)
- 2 margherita pizzas (um, this is one of the best margheritas I've ever had)
- 1 sausage pizza (pretty solid but not particularly memorable)
- 1 proscuitto and argula pizza (yum)
- 4 gelatos (a little too sweet for my liking... not a fan of the ice pieces in it either)

I ordered a cappucino at the end... good work there too.
We were stuffed and packed one whole pizza to go.

I read that this place uses spelt flour. I'm not exactly sure what that does in terms of texture/flavour but for someone with a gluten allergy, this dough did not wreck me like most pizza doughs do. Pizza crust was perfectly cooked with a nice chewy texture. Place gets pretty packed during lunch, definitely signs of a popular neighbourhood spot!"}
{"text":"I seriously don't understand what is all the hype about this place. I love my thin crust pizza, but I actually love it with good flavourful toppings and UNBURN crust, which Libretto can't seems to be able to execute. First time I was there, I ordered the duck confit pizza, which was so dry, tasteless and the crust and dough was burned. I figure that maybe is was just that pizza, so I gave it another chance and came back on a different occasion. Ordered the simplest pizza possible, the margarita, which was equally as disappointing as my first visit. Pizza was lacking flavour and again, the dough and crust was burned. Also gave them another chance to redeem themselves that night and ordered a tiramisu. It came in a cute bottle jar, which was a little to deep to spoon out an equal amount of layer of the tiramisu, forcing myself to eat only the creamy part alone, and leave the inedible rum soaked whatever at the bottom. Sorry, I've really tried to like you, but Terroni is hands down the best pizza and tiramisu in town."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience here over the weekend.  Upon arrival we were told all the tables were full but we could eat at the bar.  We said we would rather wait for a table but asked if we could grab a drink and wait at the bar.  We were told 'no, our bar is reserved for dining, it sounds silly but it's our policy'. Then we were told we could stand by the service station at the end of the bar for a drink if we wanted.  Umm, no thanks.  Instead we waited outside in the rain. The quoted 15 minutes turned into 20 and we could see vacant, set tables yet outside we remained.  Upon inquiry we were told 'you've actually only been waiting for 18 not 20 minutes'.  We were also told their computer system had crashed and that was the cause of empty tables not being filled.  Don't follow the logic, but fine.  About 10 minutes later we were taken to a table where we sat, ignored for about 10 minutes until a waiter who wasn't ours took pity on us and brought water.  He apologized for our server but couldn't take our order.  We waited another few minutes and when we still had not seen our server decided to cut our losses and leave.  Upon exiting one of the hostess actually sounded cheery and said 'oh, great!' when we told her she could have our table.

Bottom line is there is never an excuse for poor service.  Our experience made it very clear that our business was not valued.  
With Via Mercanti, Queen Margherita and Terroni all offering great pizza AND great service I will not be returning to Pizza Libretto anytime soon."}
{"text":"Have tried to take my mum here a couple of times when she's been in town, but there's always been too long a wait for a table. Finally, we managed to show up later in the evening on a Thursday, and got a table right away.

Glad we persevered! The pizza here is really great. 3 of us shared 2 pizza's - the Marinara (vegan) and the Cremini Mushroom. Both were yummy, but I especially liked the Marinara.

We also had the warm olives appetizer - really enjoyable - and a bottle of their organic red wine - also great. Ended with decaf americanos, which were delish.

Service wasn't anything special, but I didn't have any complaints either :)"}
{"text":"First off, it's most likely a bad idea trying to come here without a reservation. And if reserving, note that you typically have to do it a week in advance. The restaurant itself is quite spacious and in the summers there is a large patio. Decor is pleasant and quite trendy and hip, very similar to some other modern pizza places I've been to.

On to the food. The menu offers a small selection of salads, a fair number of appetizers/sides, then the pizzas, either white or red, and finally some dessert. I do find the number of pizza offerings slightly limited; I feel like they could benefit from having another 1 or 2 offerings under each category. There is also a prix fixe offering that comes with a salad, basic pizza (pay an extra $5 to upgrade to any other pizza), and dessert.

I had a chance to sample my friend's arugula salad, and that was quite good. As for the pizza itself, I can say that for the most part it feels pretty consistent compared to other Neopolitan-style pizzas I've had. The crust is about right, along with how it is topped. I suspect that some of the other reviewers who complain about the pizzas have no idea that the soft, floppy thin crust is exactly how the pizza was meant to be.

Having said that, my defense of this place ends there. I found the pizzas to be lacking in flavour compared to other similar pizzas I've had. It just felt like it was missing something, although I can't quite pinpoint it. It just wasn't as satisfying or delicious -- quite underwhelming. I was disappointed really. 

Our server was very friendly but her job was marred by what seems to be a terrible kitchen crew. We were here on a weekday with a noon reservation. I understand that this is prime busy time but we arrived a touch earlier and I believe we managed to beat most of the rush by getting our orders in first. It still took 40 minutes for the pizzas to arrive. This is unacceptable for an establishment located in the financial district. There were some other tables that were waiting an hour for their pizza and it looked like it still hadn't arrived! One table sat down shortly after us and ordered some time later (they made the mistake of dragging their feet with ordering), and by the time I was leaving, their orders were delayed TWICE and they had only just started to get half of their pizzas for the table. A table next to us sat down for an hour and couldn't wait any longer. It was as they were getting up that they were finally given their pizzas in takeout boxes! I don't know what is going on here, maybe it was just an off day, but if not there are some serious problems.

Overall this place is mediocre. I was fortunate enough to get my pizza within a livable amount of time, but if I was one of those other customers who waited for over an hour, I'd be livid. But I'll give them the benefit of doubt and come back another time and try one of their white pizzas. We'll see how that turns out."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. The is without a doubt the best pizza in Toronto and served by friendly, accommodating staff. The pepperoni special is fantastic, but they also have great options for vegetarians! I've also catered from here a couple of times and both times were a smashing success."}
{"text":"It was a nice experience, worth to try it!
Their pizza is very good and their ingredients are fresh.
I can definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great spot for pizza in downtown Toronto

We were seated quickly despite the crowds and service was fast and friendly!  Tried some local IPAs to begin with along with the Burrata which was delicious!!

Kids went with a basic margarita pizza - they were either starving or it was really good as it disappeared in lightening time crust and all which is usually left behind!! Mushroom white pizza was delicious - loved the fresh mushrooms, garlic and rosemary !!

Finished off with desserts - Tiramisu was amazing , and loved the off beat selections of wines by the glass! Great spot"}
{"text":"With so many reviews, there is not a lot to add, but I must say that my partner just got back from a trip to Italy including Naples and he found the pizza actually was close to identical with that in Campania.  One slight difference was that those in Italy had not charred spots on the crust, but the charring did not bother us.

The arancini appetizer special they has was terrific - he used arborio to make the rice balls and napped them in a fresh herb sauce.

Not cheap, but high quality.

My main complaint about this place would be its narrow and cluttered location.

Service was helpful and friendly if a bit artificially cheery."}
{"text":"I'm Italian - born and raised in Italy - this is one of the few pizzerie in the GTA that serves a pizza that reminds me the true Neapolitan pizza. 
Great place!"}
{"text":"Went there to test their lunch menu (for 15 dollars, you get a salad as appetizers then a choice between Margherita Pizza or Napolitana Pizza and then a dessert)

I choose the Arugula Salad (peer, walnuts and olive oil) well I had to look for the walnuts ... Still looking for aha ..
 
I had so many expectations for that pizza (so many good reviews about that restaurant) that I was kind of disappointed. The pizza was extremely thin, so thin that it was impossible to take it with the hands and the crust was not as soft and crispy as expected .. 

For dessert, basic, one sccop of ice cream or biscotti. The ice cream was too frozen and the biscotti was hard to bite ... 

It was ok, not as great as the comments :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my Favourite pizza spot downtown Toronto! Can't get enough of the Margherita D.O.P!"}
{"text":"We came in with a massive craving for meatballs and pizza lunch after catching the Curious George and the Golden Meatballs show at the Lower Ossington Theater just down the street.  

So, we ordered, yes, some meatballs (extra $4 for one extra meatball for some $16 for four toddler-fist sized meatball and a crostini smeared with roasted garlic), bambini special which includes margherita pizza, a drink and a gelato for $9 and the daily special pizza which also had some small meatballs on it (alongside cheddar, jalapeno, fresh basil...etc).  They also brought out some nice focaccia (soft and chewy) and other crusty bread with a side of balsamic in chili oil.  This was yum.  

The kids pizza and the meatballs arrived next and the pizza had too much of the burnt taste and my daughter barely ate one slice.  The meatballs were ok but the accompanying tomato sauce was too acidic and chunky for my taste and the roasted garlic shmeared with crostini was also too charred to be enjoyable.  My husband's daily special pizza was also just so so.  I'm not sure if it was just me but I found their pizza dough/crust to be too salty for my palate as well.  

After a 1/4 litre of Primitivo, meatballs, bambini pizza special and the daily special pizza, $89 for a ho hum lunch at the Libretto came to an end.  The servers were pleasant enough but the food was nowhere near good enough for me to want to make that trek again.  I'll stick to Queen Margherita's in the East end for my pizza cravings for now."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location twice and enjoyed it a lot on both occasions. I like their Neapolitan style of pizza, with the blistered charred crust and good quality toppings. Had the salami cacciatore last night, with lots of good salami, fresh tasty tomato and basil sauce, and dollops of nice cheese. A good short list of reasonably-priced Italian wines, including a robust Aglianico del Vulture. Service is friendly and efficient. Highly recommended for pre-theatre or symphony dining."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. Service is awful. We had to ask for menus. He asked if we wanted bread and never brought it out. After we inquired he brought it out after our meal arrived. Not somewhere I will return to anytime soon. Felt like we were troubling the staff the entire time."}
{"text":"I'm sure to came back again here.
Delicious pizza, nice atmosphere, we were satisfied with all.
For appetizer, I recommend beef carpaccio?"}
{"text":"Nice and relaxing hangout spot. We had the duck confit pizza. I must say for $19, the pizza was kind of disappointing. The dough was thin which I don't mind but the middle part was soggy. It did not taste spectacular. To be honest, I thought the portion was small and not worth the price."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by the pizza. Tried the mushroom pizza and prosciutto pizzas. The mushroom one was really heavy on the garlic and prosciutto was a little on the bland side."}
{"text":"The job of a hostess is to give a guest a welcoming experience which sets the precedent for the rest of the night. Asked the hostess if our table was ready since we were a bit early - she brushed us off with a 'your table will be ready at the time of your reservation' rolling her eyes at us. When I asked if we can get seated a bit early: 'there's a waiting list' and rolled our eyes at us again. 

Rude hostess that caused me to cancel my reso and go across the street to Little Anthony's. Work on your hiring choices Libretto. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has great food, class and style.... Unfortunately everybody in town knows it. If you're going on the weekend for a dinner, expect long waits.

The plus side of waiting is that you can grab drinks down the street at The Saint tavern while you wait.

Seriously, any place that spends the cash to import a wood oven from Italy, brick by goddamn brick, is going to have amazing pizza. This may go without saying but if you're going, order a pizza. Don't be a f-idiot and get salad or some other nonsense. You don't make friends with salad!"}
{"text":"90-seconds baked stone pizzas are made here and it's delish. It's so good that even when I went home and reheated my leftovers (with printed instruction on the takeout box ) it still tasted really good! 

The pizzas are individual sizes but honestly I can't even finish a whole one myself. 

The flavours are unique and tasty and the service was consistently good. 

This is also a great place to impress your date (first date or 5/6/7th date) not only because of the food, the sharing accessibility, but the atmosphere and decorum is hip, trendy and a little romantic (I mean it is Italian food).

I've only been to the University and Ossington location and I prefer the University location due to its big and open windows. The Ossington location is small and narrow (but the location is close to my fav ice cream place - Bang Bang) down the street, south of Argyle street."}
{"text":"Walked in to a restaurant that was half full. The only tables that were left were tables of 4. We were a group of two. The host refused to seat us at a table, and would only sit us at the bar. 

I used to love Libretto and have been a ton of times, but this is just money grubbing bad service. Doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been itching to try this place for a while, but somehow never got around to it. This changed about two weeks ago, where I had the opportunity to come and have dinner here twice. 

Few things, Pizzeria Libretto does not take reservations( seems like all the hottest food spots don't), so if you want to come here for dinner get there early or late... peak time, you might be in for a wait...

While Pizzeria Libretto does offer different types of pizza, I recommend going for their classic Margherita or Marinera (like the Margherita but no cheese) for the simple flavour of their tomato sauce. Their crust is amazing, soft and chewy, and very flavourful. They do give your their house chili oil to swab the crusts in, however I don't feel it is really needed.

Order their salad with mushrooms, which is big enough to share with one other person. I suggest skipping their calamari and their housemade meatballs; don't get me wrong they are good, but the mushroom salad is a bigger hit as a starter.

For dessert, their tiramisu is a winner for sure, as a rule I don't like soggy cake, which is what Tiramisu typically is. However Pizzeria Libretto does their tiramisu in a mason jar, and can be described more like a pudding with bits of cake stirred in. I'd say you can share with someone for this, but ... inevitably someone will want the last spoonful, as which point spoons @ high noon might occur. 

Service is excellent, despite the place is bustling, but well worth the vist to Little Portugal/Ossington strip."}
{"text":"I had a margarita pizza and a tiramisu for desert. The food was good but not as good as expected. Pizzas are oven baked, the crust was good and I liked the tomato sauce tasting like actually tomato but I wasn't really hungry when I came and didn't really felt full after the pizza (pizzas usually fill my tummy). I ordered desert with a tiramisu, nice presentation, but the biscuit was soaking coffee, I know it's normal but a bit too much soaking. It was good but tiramisu is a serious business for me lol and it was \"just\" good. Prices are reasonable for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Libretto is my go-to, come-as-you-are dining option that I keep coming back for. It's not fancy--so I have no problem dashing out in a sweatshirt--but it isn't devoid of charm either. It strikes a fine balance, makes a solid pie that carries out quickly and easily and offers up some nice salads and appetizers to tempt your tummy beyond the slice.

A standard greasy slice it is not, but a very strong contender for TO's best pizza with high quality ingredients and toppings. I usually always get the special of the day, which I feel usually justifies its' nearly $20 price tag. Coming here for a Napolitano/plain cheese is bound to be a let down. Why pay these kinds of prices for a cheese pizza? Let the kitchen show you what they can do, dribble a little bit of that silky chilli-infused olive oil on your crust, and enjoy."}
{"text":"They do not accept reservations! Came here on a Friday evening and it was hopping! They let you leave a number that they will text so you can walk in the area (and Bang bang ice cream is just down the street...dessert should be first!!) service was good and friendly and the ambiance is dark and romantic, albeit very loud. 

The pizza and crust are delicious. 
- The capers, anchovies, black and cheese-less pizza was underwhelming and too salty
-the featured salami, basil and cheese with a maple glaze was amazing! A nice combo of slightly sweet with the salt of the salami and cheese

The calamari had an amazing sauce under it and was super crispy and a lot of it

The beef carpaccio was good, but nothing too special

The meatball is VERY DISAPPOINTING and not worth ordering at all 

The summer salad is delicious with a fried egg, zucchini, fris√©e and a vinegar+mustard dressing (make sure you like mustard and vinegar if you order this)"}

{"text":"I went there with a friend who apready knew the place. It is a nice restaurant, quite small so I might think twice before going with a group, but the experience was great. I had the cacciatore salami pizza and the espresso cinnamon gelato for dessert and both were delicious. I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza unless it is super soft and this one sure is soft and amazingly good! The gelato is house made and was to die for. It even came with a biscotti. They have also have a good enough selection of craft brews which only increases my opinion of the place as well as an alright wine selection. Service was good, the young lady waiting on us was very friendly, she took time to explain us the evening's specials which all sounded great. I will definitely go back but would advise on making a reservation! Great find!"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. The pizza here is fantastic the spelt crust is by far the best wheat free option I've encountered. 

Service isn't always the quickest but they're typically quite busy so ya understandable.

Most recently, we were a group of 15 and it was very well managed and organized."}
{"text":"Came here two nights in a row. 

First night was great. Sat at the bar, server was pleasant and attentive. 

Second night came in with a group of five. Four of the pizzas came out on time while the fifth was wrong. By the time the correct pizza came out the rest of the table was finished eating. That person had his pizza boxed up and took it back to the hotel, essentially turning him from a patron to a hungry delivery boy. 

When alerted the manager refused to offer any relief, saying the correct pizza came out in world record time. Maybe in his eyes, but not in time for our friend to enjoy his dining experience.

The white pizzas are good, but not good enough to pay full price to watch your friends eat their food and get yours 45 minutes later. With so many options in the area, don't waste your time with people that don't value your patronage."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, I am really picky about my pizza. This place was good and catered to my dietary restrictions. I got the spicy, red pizza pie with cherry peppers, onions and olives. The crust was a little soggy for me but overall it was tasty. They give you chili oil on the side which was nice. Good pizza joint in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 6 on a Tuesday night.  Made a reservation beforehand so there was no wait - but Libretto definitely looked quite busy for a weekday night so make sure to reserve prior if you don't want to watch delicious pizzas pass while standing in line at the resto entrance :P

THE FOOD
App
2 servings of Arancini - Italian riceballs :3  Basil & Pine Nut Pesto, Bufala Mozzarella, Peperonata & Tomato - maybe I'm not a connoisseur on Itailan food but this tasted okay to me.  The risotto or whatever rice they used inside the fried dough exterior was a little cold, and the flavours of all the ingredients I had tasted separately instead of altogether...  supposed to be one of the best Italian restos for arancini in Toronto though.

Mains - Pizzas! 
Duck confit - Duck confit aside, the pear was delicious on this pizza!  Kinda almost overpowered the duck confit to be honest, but I still quite liked it since it was a nice contrast between sweet and salty.
Ndjuga sausage - My fave pizza of the night  Did not expect this to be too spicy but it actually was a little bit.  The combination of oregno, basil and garlic made this pizza absolutely mouthwatering.
Cremini mushroom - Very creamy and much mushroom.  The mozarella was great and the herbs mix of rosemary and thyme made this quite enjoyable.
Ontario prosciutto & arugula - I had high hopes for this pizza, but it was alright.. definitely liked the prosciutto on the pizza, but the ingredients of the pizza didn't come together, and I ended up tearing off the pieces of prosciutto first, then eating the arugula, then the pizza itself... the dough was just chewy enough for me though, so no complaint there.

The service was good in that they accommodated our party of 6 and cut all the pizzas into six slices albeit oddly shaped and uneven :P  Recommended for Italian food lovers :)"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this spot from friends and colleagues. So I was really surprised to find the food really under whelming. The buttermilk calamari was okay, it tasted like any other deep fried calamari. I was shocked however to find their pizza was quite plain. The meat pizzas were all okay, the tomato sauce in the margherita pizza tasted like just canned tomato sauce, and I found the crusts too doughy and chew . The service from our server however was great."}
{"text":"I took a girl here, waste of money first of all im paying 17 dollars for a small pizza which was below average, it didnt even taste authentic to me. I ordered the duck pizza first off to much rosemary,  i could get a better deal at pizza hut or pizza pizza and that pizza taste way better. The crust was soggy the duck was disgusting it wasn't even tender it tasted frozen. This place should be closed down for calling themselves authentic for sure 100 percent i will never come here again"}
{"text":"I had the mushroom pizza. It was delicious, but just a tad salty. Overall an okay pizza, nothing to rave about really. I don't understand the hype over Pizza Libretto."}
{"text":"This place is supposedly for pizza, but I'm going to let you in on a secret.

Sure, their pizzas are \"VPN certified\", sure they're pretty good, but the real hype here should be for their spicy meatballs.
Dear lord.
The meatballs are made with a blend of meat and some other spice--rosemary? I don't know, but it's fragrant. They come with a slightly crispy slab of garlic bread and spicy tomato sauce.

Is it juvenile for me to like meatballs? Because if it is, then I am so totally underage."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Toronto, and boy was I craving some thin curst pizza. Much yelp.ca research later I decided we zeroed in on Pizzeria Libretto.
We expected it to be good, but I didn't expect to be completely blown away. It was AMAZING!!! I've eaten my fair share of great pizza and consider myself to be a decent pizza connoisseur. I could wax on and on about the perfect crust, the deliscious sauce, the just-right amount of toppings.
We ordered the bufala+margherita pizza and sausage pizza. The lemon panna cotta in the end was the perfect sweet ending on a hot summer day.
I'll be back to my favorite new eatery in Toronto soon :)
Quick Tip: They don't take reservations, but there's a bar next door you can get a drink at. They'll call you when your table is ready. 
Quick Tip 2: Get the bufala mozzarella with your margherita pizza."}
{"text":"I ate at Libretto on King on Saturday night as a group of 16, for a friend's birthday. It was a $30 prix fixe menu (had been arranged beforehand) and worked out really well. All dishes were served family style, with multiple platters of each dish spread out along the table. We started with kale salad and gnocchi, then 4 different pizzas, and dessert platters. TONS of food, more than enough for everyone, amazing value. Food was great, service was good, bills were all separated properly, overall a great experience. I always enjoy the food at Libretto but now knowing they're good with groups, I'd definitely recommend it for a large party."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get out much anymore, but this place is great! We've been to the original location a few times and we were sceptical because of some reviews. Anyway, our experience was a very good one. Pizza crust perfectly baked, gnocchi delicious, tiramisu was awesome, service perfect. Our only complaint was that the spiadini were not hot enough, so we assume they're not prepared to order. The decor is very modern and fresh, nicer than the other locations in my opinion, and it's not as busy. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite pizza places in Toronto. 

Food: Their chili oil is not too spicy and doesn't take over the flavour of the pizza yet it adds the perfect kick. Their buttermilk fried calamari is one of my personal favourites. The sauce is so unique, you have to try it! Two of the best pizzas there are the margherita and the porscuitto di parma & arugula! Amazing with the chili oil. 

Space: The interior of this location is very nice and spacious. It has the perfect balance of privacy mixed with openness. 

Service: The service here is alright. The second time I went, we weren't acknowledged by the server until around 10 minutes after we had sat down and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. 

Extra: I've ordered uber eats from here too and the pizza was still very delicious. They give you a little side of the chili oil. Amazing! 

Overall, great restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and shared a Margherita pizza with vegan cheese and a kale salad. I can't eat dairy and not too many pizza places offer vegan cheese so this was amazing. The cheese itself is made in-house and it was one of the best non-dairy cheeses I've had. The servers were super nice and attentive - delicious lunch and we left with full stomachs!"}
{"text":"We've tried the duck confit pizza and the nduja sausage pizza on past visits here - both are delicious! Ingredients used are fresh and you taste that in each bite. My only complaint is that I wish they put more meat on the pizza overall but that's my personal preference since it seems authentic Italian pizza is skimpier on the toppings in general.

The place is always busy so be prepared to wait for a table if you're doing walk in or you could always do takeout, which is pretty efficient too. Service is good though and my friend even got a free tiramisu from a nice server! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner on the way to the Fleetwood Mac concert. They had the \"Winterlicious\" special on. For $25.00/pp u can get an Appy, main & dessert...very decent deal. I had the Yellow Beet Caprese salad with Nduja Sausage Pizza. Pizza was good but didn't blow me outta the water. Thought it was a little undercooked even though I asked for it well done. Their house made Tiramisu was solid. Almost as good as any I've tasted. This is a do over for me, only thing I'd change is the Pizza \"doneness\"."}
{"text":"This is a gourmet family pizza restaurant located in the heart of Trinity-Bellwood area or TO. This place was jammed. Busy as hell for a Saturday nite. Took us 30 minutes to get a table. 

The service was ok. Both fast & slow. Fast as I got my pizza quit quickly. Slow aHad a house special pizza that had Sausage/Pepperoni/buffalo Mozzarella on it. It was good but the centre was a little soggy which Lindt detracted. I'd go to this place again but I wouldn't go outta my way to do so."}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about this restaurant so maybe it was hyped up for me but it did not live up to its expectations. First of all the service was mediocre. The waiter got everything done but I didn't feel like he was happy to be there.

My boyfriend got the Margherita pizza (Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella) and it was fine. I got the House-Made Sausage (Caramelized Onion, Mozzarella, Chili Oil) and it was way too oily. I know it was made with chili oil but it doesn't mean that the bottom of half my pizza had to be just oil. It was so bad, I started feeling sick from it so I couldn't finish it.

The dessert was great though. I forced my boyfriend to get the Vanilla Affogato (gelato drowned in espresso) because one of my friends recommended it. He didn't like the expresso because he didn't want to stay up all night. I thought it was a neat concept and I really enjoyed it. I got myself the Libretto Tiramisu which came in a mason jar and I absolutely loved it (for coffee lovers, the coffee taste is very strong!). The Tiramisu is definitely a dessert to share so make sure whoever you go with is willing to eat it with you. I unfortunately had to finish it all on my own...which I didn't really mind since it was so tasty!

Would I come back here? I'm a firm believer in giving restaurants a second chance so I would come back here. Just not any time soon."}
{"text":"Went here for early dinner. What a treat. Great service with lovely atmosphere. We ordered calamari and kale salad as starters. Really yummy and nicely presented. Then an eggplant mozzarella pizza. So delicious. Highly recommend and will go back!"}
{"text":"I really like Neapolitan pizza. It is a huge thing back in DC and it is my first choice for sure. I came here with a group and was the martyr in the ordering process. The salad with the egg was probably the highlight. The menu was actually pretty small, but everything we had was really good. If I lived near here I would probably eat here somewhat frequently, though it is still kind of expensive for pizza, but it isn't so great that I would make the trip across town to end up here. A solid offering though."}
{"text":"Probably best Pizza in town. Food and wait staff were great. Wish they took reservations!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Friday and to my pleasant surprise, they offer a lunch menu! For the price of a normal pizza (~ $15) you get a three course meal.. Talk about value! 

For starters you get a choice of salad.. The one I chose was arugula.. It was perfectly dressed lightly with some thin slices of pear.. It was delicious. 

For the pizza, I chose a margherita.. You can change it to any type on the menu by paying the difference. 

For dessert they offer a choice of sorbet or biscotti."}
{"text":"This place has phenomenal service. The staff was friendly and attentive and made sure our time here was enjoyable. Our glasses were always full and the manager came by to explain the delay in our antipasto when we didn't even notice! 

We got the piatto grande and it was so worth it! Great share plate & very nice plating. It came with a souffl√© like bread that paired well with the plate. Pleasantly surprised with the portion. 

For mains, we ended up getting the margherita and nduja pizzas. They offer chilli oil that pairs nicely with the pizzas. The oil isn't too spicy so be sure to give it a try as it brings out the flavour of the pizzas. The two options we had were very similar in taste but very enjoyable nonetheless. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience here & I would come back to try their other pizzas and antipasto if I were in the area."}
{"text":"The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.

This place is OK. Good pizza but prickish service and expensive drinks except beer bring it down from 4-3 for me.

They have best crusts in town but I find their pizza too salty and tasteless. Their chilly sauce is $1.50 which is a little bit of salt on my foodie ego.

I have had the Ontario Prosciutto and Arugla, The White Anchovy, The sausage and the duck. All are good but not great. 

The salad is decent

Service has been from average to prickly.

Here are some sample comments. 

Us: Which pizzas have a tomato sauce
Server: The pizzas that say tomato, that means tomato sauce

Us: May we get the pizza cut. 
Server: The pizza here is always cut

A word to the management: Get rid of socially awkward pissy waiters. You are a hot shot venue, you can afford them."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We had the calamari, which was very crispy on the outside but tender inside. The dip that it came with was great too; savory and creamy with a bit of freshness from the herbs. Also got the prosciutto and arugula pizza. This was a great combination of the peppery and fresh arugula with the salty prosciutto. Top it off with some chili oil that you can ask for and the taste goes up several notches. Two of us shared one pizza with the appetizer and it was enough for a late dinner. Only downside is that it is pricey for pizza (and not in Mississauga. Come to the suburbs!). I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was a beacon of pizza warmth and light on a blistery night in the 6ix. After struggling to find space in neighbouring restaurants, my friend remember Pizzeria Libretto has recently opened on University and we were determined to get some delicious food in our tummies. We arrived and there were three spots open at the bar, and our previous wandering was all forgotten. I thought to myself \"Why didn't we come here in the first place?\", because we definitely should have. The atmosphere was lively, but calm enough that we could hear each other quite comfortably. All of the wait staff that we came in contact with were friendly and struck the perfect balance between professional (so you feel like you are getting great service) and casual (so you feel like relaxed). 

On top of all that, the food was amazing. I shared the Ricotta Gnocchi Fritti , fried pillowy gnocchi that came on a bed of sweet tomato sauce with spicy nduja sausage. The sauce was so delicious that I plotted to take the last bite as we were sharing so that I could mop it all up with the complimentary bread. That alone will bring me back, and it isn't even the pizza they are known for. Of course I did have pizza too, and I got the nduja pizza. At first I was hesitant to order nduja sausage twice in one meal, but the friendly server assured me that it definitely would not be a mistake, and he was right. The oregano and basil added a bright punch to the spicy sausage and the chewy, crispy crust was able to withstand all of that goodness. 

All in all, the pizzas are great, but don't ignore the appetizers! The couple beside us shared a plate of meatballs and instantly made a mental note to go back for those as well, and I think you should too."}
{"text":"As always I had an amazing Margherita pizza. The trick with this place is to order takeout ahead of time and pick it up instead of waiting on the insane queue. An insane taste and worth the higher than average price tag."}
{"text":"I've been to the Ossington location, as well as the one on King a handful of times. Amazing service at both locations - waiters came to check regularly, waters never empty, and no problem splitting the bill, even with large (7) parties. 
My favorites at libretto are the proscuitto and arugula pizza, as well as the gnocci. Although the proscuitto and arugula were not on the menu at the King st location in Jan 2017, we were still able to order it.The marinara here is fresh, and the oil is a must-have on the pizza. The gnocci is actually fried a little bit so it forms a crisp, similar to a gnocci tater-tot (in a good way, of course). 
I recommend this place to all my friends, and will never get sick of it!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! I'm drooling just thinking about it. Libretto makes a damn fine pizza. The spicy oil that comes on the side is a perfect complement.

I would skip the deep fried gnocchi. The salads are good, but I'm always tempted to forego vegetables and order another pizza instead...

Big complaint: we came on a Saturday night and were told it would be a 45 minute wait and ended up waiting over 2h. Thankfully there are bars nearby to waste time at, but really, 2h is ridiculous. They need to start taking reservations. I think next time I am craving Libretto, I will order take-out.

The lunch special ($15 for a salad, basic pizza, and dessert) is an amazing deal if you can make it out on a weekday for lunch. We came on Good Friday (not representative of a regular weekday, I know) and still had to wait 45 minutes! Argh!"}
{"text":"The napoleon style pizza Libretto makes is delicious, but sadly they aren't the best in the city at it. I've had better pizzas at Pizzeria Defina on Roncy, and Pizzeria Via Mercanti in Kensington Market. AND I believe both pizzas were cheaper.

When I was at Libretto I got the duck confit pizza. On that pizza is duck confit, pears, and mozzarella. It was a VERY dry pizza. I found myself pouring on the oil at the table to be able to scarf it down. There was a lack of pear slices on that pizza that really would have helped the dryness and made it way more appetizing. There was maybe 5-6 pear slices on it total. From my experience, and from the photos I have seen, I would describe the pizzas they make as sloppy.

The place has the hype, and the following, but so does McDonald's. Most people don't really know what good food is... It's not bad pizza by any means, but I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"I came in during a lunch hour rush on a Tuesday and there was a slight hiccup in seating my group, who the receptionist only thought was a party of two. We were a group of four. So we had to wait a few minutes longer. We didn't have a reservation, so it took about 15 minutes before the bar opened up, but we decided to wait another 15 minutes until a table opened up.

We each got our own pizzas, but cut up slices to share with each other. I had the duck confit, but honestly I wish I went with a meatier pizza, or the cremini mushroom. The cremini mushroom was my favorite. The crust was charred on one pizza, so we ate around it. Service was good. We got our bread and water in a reasonable amount of time, and the server kept coming around to check on us to see if we were happy. 

Overall, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love their pizzas!! Both eggplant and mushroom were really good. However, it did take a while before we got our food. Our drinks were already finished."}
{"text":"1.5 stars

I got take out because I live 5 mins away. I picked up right at the time they mentioned it would be ready; however, the pizza was cold. 

The beets salad was good, but for some reason the cheese was melted which isn't the case in all other people's photos. 

So overall the takeout experience wasn't that great but maybe dine-in would be better."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Favorites include: Margherita pizza, nduja (sausage pizza), and duck confit.  The calamari is also super delicious and the Nutella Italian donuts is a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give Pizzeria Libretto 3 stars because it is exactly A-OK. 

The service is just fantastic - we were in the restaurant till late and they didn't rush us out and on the contrary made us feel welcome. They gave us wonderful recommendations and what was great were their plethora of vegetarian options.

The arancini were nice but the insides were slightly cold and it was quite garlicky. I also had the margherita pizza which was good but not memorable. I ended the meal with a cappuccino which was probably the highlight of the evening for me!

I think Pizzeria Libretto is the perfect place if you're going with a group or taking someone out you don't know well. The menu is easy and there is definitely something everyone would like and you know that the service will keep everyone in a good mood!"}
{"text":"Cremini mushroom pizza is to die for !!! 

The fried calamari with romesco sauce was a great way to start. They had a glitch with our pizzas hence the order took longer but the server pro-actively checked in with us from time to time to let us know of the status. Skip the eggplant pizza if you can.

Finally, this is how Neapolitan pizza should taste like. Good job Libretto is restoring my faith that all hope is not lost in Toronto !!!"}
{"text":"Finally made time to visit this pizza shop. Overall it was a good experience. I started with the grilled calamari which was cooked perfectly but a little to over salted for my liking, as well as the olives which were delicious, and the beef tartar which was full of flavour. I ordered the sausage pizza as my entr√©e and it was to die for!!! Stone cooked to perfection. Our server quickly brought over out bill before asking if we wanted dessert, so we kindly asked her to bring the dessert menu. I ordered the tiramisu, it was creamy and delicious.  Overall we had a great dinner, next time I'm craving great pizza I will be dropping by."}
{"text":"Really really great pizza!  Good place to go after work in the financial district, not a lot of seating but if you get there before the rush it's great place for drinks and food during the week!"}
{"text":"Unreal za. Not ur average pizza iolo pepperoni we're talkin straight outta nonnas barn. Menu items r hard to pronounce if ur not italian. They have a chalk board downstairs so stop by and write/draw something jokes. Tom out."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Pizzeria Libretto.  It was surprisingly busy for a Monday night.

Brie, my server, started me off with soft bread and a spicy oil for dipping.  I love love love pizza and ordered a pepperoni pizza with no jalapenos.  It was delicious.  The crust was soft and chewy.  There was a lot of pepperoni.

Brie was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"We had supper at Pizzeria Libretto Friday night.  We've heard excellent things about it and have been wanting to go ... hard to believe it's been five years since they been in our 'hood and we've never been!

It was busy when we got there and stayed that way all night.  There was a good vibe.

Pizzas bake in less than 90 seconds in a 900 degree wood burning oven, hand built by a third generation pizza oven maker in Naples

Shannon, our server, started us off with some bread and oil and it was delicious.

We shared a bottle of bubbly ... Sussura (VQA) by Hinterland, Prince Edward County, which is bottled exclusively for Pizzeria Libretto.  

Our friend, Steve, is a chef and took care of ordering appetizers ... plus he and Simone had been there before.

We also shared a bottle of red wine ... Nero D'avola 2012 IGT, Matto, Sicilia

We all ordered pizza.   I ordered a Nduja Sausage pizza with tomato, garlic, oregano, basil, mozzarella and stracciatell.  It was delicious and had a bit of a kick.  So much food and I took half my pizza home

Simone and Steve split an Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula pizza with garlic, tomato, oregano and shaved Grana Padano.

Gord had the feature pizza with mozzarella, truffle paste, mushrooms and berkshire ham.  He said it was fabulous.

We got dessert.  None of us had room for it but we managed to eat it all!  Yum!!  The ice cream is made in-house and was so good!  The donuts were warm.

Shannon, our server, took excellent care of us.  Pizzeria Libretto is a great spot and I'm glad we finally got there ... and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Pizzeria Libretto.  It opened in the fall.

Pizzas are baked in an 850F oven for 90 seconds.

We both ordered pizzas.  I got the Nduja Sausage pizza.  I've had it at their Ossington location and enjoyed it.  It was delicious!  Gord ordered the special pizza ... it had salami, red peppers, basil, mozzarella cheese and gorgonzola cheese.  He said it was really good.

 Stephanie was our server.  She was friendly and attentive and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"Great Neapolitan style pizza in toronto. Margarita pizza is great. They have a great lunch special... salad, pizza, dessert for a great price.  Great alternative for a team lunch if you work in financial district."}
{"text":"The value of this restaurant is incredible; the ingredients are incredibly fresh and the wine list ranges from $20-30.

The complaints about the pizza to me, are probably unfounded. I've eaten a lot of pizza, and I would say that the pizza consistently impresses me. The only place I like better is Franny's in Brooklyn, but to me there is no where better in Toronto. 

The best pizza is the Sausage in my opinion. It's divine. 

The waits are long, though that should be expected given that they do 2000 people a week, in a restaurant that size."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that my dinner dates and I got to the restaurant at 8pm on a cold Thursday night, we were seated and had our drink orders made quickly.  
There was a good list of options for our vegetarian co-diner and I actually ended up choosing a veg pizza myself.  Each of us ordered different pizzas an all were delicious, I'm especially fond of the Margherita pizza.  The bread pudding dessert special was also fantastic.  
I was also really impressed by the wine list which featured now only great Italian choices but also some fantastic VQAs (specifically from Hidden Bench winery.). 
All in all Pizza Libretto totally lives up to the hype with great food, service and a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located along King street among other popular spots. It leads to an underground hub but high enough so that natural sunlight is ample. My office decided to have a farewell lunch here for one of our coworkers. 

We arrived at around 12:30 and our seating was already waiting with cutlery laid out. We made a reservation beforehand. The restaurant was not busy at all. The staff were friendly in their greeting. We were given the menus however it was three menus for a table of nine. The waitress introduce herself and asked about allergies. 

The food took a long time to come out despite us ordering beforehand when we made the reservation. It was family style salad. An all green plate full of baby arugula, watercress and topped with chunks of walnut and shaved pear. It was dressed in an oily based dressing. It was alittle on the bitter side. Next came the bread. It was an assortment of three types of bread. My favourite was the herb one. It was served with chilli oil and a balsamic vinegrette that I couldn't stop licking off the bread. 

We also had the caprese style tomato and bocconcini cheese side. It was garnished with basil. I was sorely disappointed with the pizza. It reminded me of flatbread, cheese and tomato sauce baked on an ever so thin crust. I felt like I could have made the pizza myself and it would have turned out better. Some of it was also burnt. All the courses had the same flavour theme of cheese, tomato and salad and while one may like the compliments in taste, I did not. All the courses tasted similar. Therefore, the bread was what stood out which is weird considering that it was not the main. The espresso cinnamon gelato was so decant and yummy. One scoop was too little. It was the right hint of espresso. If you ever visit here, this is your best bet for dessert. 

They accept credit and debit cards.The family style lunch: vegetarian pizza, salad, cheese and tomato, side order of bread and one scoop of gelato costs each of us $16 per person. This is average in my opinion. 

Overall, I give two stars because of the ambience of this place. For a pizzaeria, I was disappointed with the pizza."}
{"text":"I'll try to make this short.
I had the Margherita pizza, which was good, tasty, albeit a little burnt.  It wasn't any better than Massimos, which is really saying something with the price difference.

I liked the availability of Italian soft-drinks in glass bottles, but we were seated in a rather strange and uncomfortable place.  I love communal dining, but it's not really ok to seat a couple at a big, completely empty long table, with bar-height chairs.  It felt like eating a meal while on stage, with a hipster audience seated at low booths and tables all around us.

They could use a few more vegetarian options on the menu, but the staff were friendly, the decor was great, and I might give the place another chance."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday for dinner and had no problems finding a table for 2. Started off with the calamari, one of the best that I've ever tried! The texture and taste was amazing. The duck confit pizza was also very tasty. Ambience and service was great. Would like to try out the other locations!"}
{"text":"I have been to all four Libretto's over the past couple of years (it's an easy place to suggest with friends and one opened up right by our place, etc) and I must say, the pizzas are never quite right. Often, the pizza dough was much too thin for the amount of sauce carelessly globbed on, and the flavours never popped out. The cocktails are fine, but nothing to write home about, and the service is always inconsistent. I wouldn't recommend this place, and won't be going anymore. There are far too many other great restaurants that make better napoletanas than here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband on a Saturday night. Wasn't too busy when we arrived (630pm) but it picked up as we were leaving (730pm). The atmosphere is a little noisy and there was this pesky fly that kept flying around our table since they kept the front door open. We were seated in a part of the restaurant where we could see the food being made and could see that the food was made quickly but for some reason the service was slow so not sure what happened. 
We ordered the arancini, buttermilk calamari and margherita pizza. My husband really liked the arancini because you could really taste the smoked cheese. I absolutely loved the calamari (and it's presented in this pyramid stack). My husband is not of  Neapolitan style pizza but I thought it was ok, especially if you dip the crust in the oil dip they provided with the bread lol"}
{"text":"We ventured back (in truth we were looking for somewhere new) to PL 3 or 4 years after an initial visit.

It did take 15 minutes to be seated with most of that time spent awkwardly dodging staff and already seated patrons who were visiting the washroom. The smallish jammed in tables was another negative but the food was happily as good as we've had in years at any pizza specialist. 

I could have dined on just the bread, oil and an IPA. Beet salad and cauliflower frittata were both 4.5s. The margarita pizza was as good as the version that used to be served at Via Allegro and that is high praise.

To drive and search for parking in this part of Toronto, for this Mississaugan, the resto has to above average. Thankfully it was and we will be back."}
{"text":"With North of Brooklyn down the street, these guys shouldn't keep up their snobby demeanor. We've ordered take-out from Libretto at least 30+ times, have dined-in a handful of times. Has generally been decent. 

My last experience was the absolute last time we will be ordering from them. Usually would call ahead for pick up, however this particular day I was walking by and decided to order at the shop and wait for my pizzas to be ready to take home. I ordered 2 pizzas. This was around 5pm on a weekday, so the bar area was still not at capacity. I asked the gentleman who swiped my credit card to PAY for the 2 pizzas that I had ordered if I could sit at the bar and order a beer, you know, while I wait for my order. I was told to stand where I was and I could order a beer and have it while standing \"the bar is full service and for paying customers\". 

I actually found it so unbelievable, I was speechless. Just chuckled and walked out, had a really nice cold beer at the bar next door. 

They will always do well, so this is essentially a waste of a review."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, great atmosphere! Prosciutto arugula is always one of my favorites and it did not let down! Usually a bit of a wait but worth it!"}
{"text":"Food 4
Service 3

This place takes no reservations, so be prepared to wait (depending on the date if the week).

The pizzas here are consistently good. Our favorite is the Nduja and the classic Margherita or Libretto Margherita. 

We've dined in about a handful of time, but because the wait and lack if reservation are so inconvenient (especially in the winter) we have been ordering take out lately and just picking up and it works out great!"}
{"text":"Caveat Emptor - servers here have a terrible habit of adding on group gratuity and not telling you, so you tip twice.

I'm the fool here for not checking my bills, but a few glasses of wine in, you're not thinking about this. I hate seeing this kind of immoral behaviour."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place such a \"meh\" review, but I honestly didn't think it was over-the-top amazing. While the wood fire pizza was good, we had a few hiccups during our visit here. This place is my friends favorite pizza place in Toronto, and I can see why. They offer salads, wood fire pizzas and delicious-sounding drinks. We went to the location downtown which didn't have an intimate feel and definitely felt like a \"modern\" decor type place. The ambiance of this location didn't reflect the way the menu was set up or how I picture a wood-fire/Italian restaurant to be.

We had pretty less-than-stellar service when it came to drinks. A mutual friend ordered a dry gin martini with extra olives, but they kept making her a dirty martini which is not what she asked for. In my mind a dry gin martini should be clear and not cloudy. All she wanted was olives in it, not olive juice, which they kept doing so it was very salty. A dry gin martini should not be salty at all.

We ordered some arugula salads and I ordered the Margherita pizza. The food was fine: I don't want to make it seem like this place was garbage. That isn't the case. I've just had better wood-fire pizza and salad in Ann Arbor and other places. What I will say is the person who delivered our pizzas to the table told me that mine was not up to the chef's standards so they were remaking mine. I did appreciate that, but it was still pretty lackluster when I got it: soggy and droopy and not very crispy, not a ton of cheese on it, or basil and very heavy on the tomato sauce.

I'm not sure I'd go back here, but if I did, I think I want to try a different location to see if it's different."}
{"text":"1st timer! Didn't have the greatest intro - no hostess available and had to wait about 5mins after entering for one, even after asking a waitress. Once seated, hung my own coat and a waitress was about 2 steps away from me and didn't offer to help and the hostess didn't even address our coats or the Coat rack. Anyways, hoping the food would make up for it and it did. I ordered the Margherita pizza with spelt crust (which did not taste like cardboard BTW!), beef carpaccio and a glass of montepulciano. 4 stars because of the poor service in the beginning and the place is a *slight* cash grab. Skimpy cheese on the pizza (order extra cheese, which they list on the menu - clue #1), arugula is an extra 2 bucks for your beef carpaccio, which may be authentic Italian IDK I've always had it come with (clue #2) and the wine pour was very very light (barely 6oz if that!) in any regard the food was very good and I would Return, this time with the right expectations."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I'm a huge fan of   prosciutto, however the prosciutto on my pizza (I got the Ontario prosciutto with arugula pizza) was far too salty. The Risotto balls my friend and I got was SO GOOD! 
I have been here before and enjoyed it in the past. The service is attentive (very important in my books), they even ask \"are there any allergies I should be aware of?\"! That was fantastic!
Looking forward to trying more on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Spicy meatballs, hand made sausage pizza! Don't forget the coffee (will keep you up till the wee hours of the morning) Chewy, elastic pizza! Mm hmm."}
{"text":"Reservations are a must here.

2 of us had dinner here on a Thursdsay evening. My friend enjoyed her pizza (it's big for one person to finish) and I had the arancini and kale salad. The arancini and salad were quite good.

They have several wines available by the glass or half liter, prices mostly at the higher end.

Service was good & they did not rush us which was great."}

{"text":"Dan's the man!
We came into Libretto last night looking for a relaxing evening. We order the marinara pizza and argula salad, both were excellent! I ordered one 9 oz glass of the house red however, there was a miscommunication and the wine didn't get to our table until after our food was served and on top of that the staff brought a whole bottle of wine instead of my 9 oz glass. We asked to cancel the wine as we weren't in the mood anymore after we had already started eating. The manager (Dan) came to our table within seconds to apologize and explain what happened. And then he offered us a half liter of the house red on the house! We honestly weren't that upset when we didn't get our wine (maybe a tad frustrated) but Dan saved the day with his incredible customer service. We really appreciate him explaining to us what happened and the free wine was pleasant surprise. Keep up the great work. We look forward to coming back for the amazing food and outstanding customer service!"}
{"text":"I have learned in eating Neapolitan pizza that the Margherita and the Marinara is what you need to order because that is honestly all you will get when you visit Naples (I have been). This place scored right up there with our experience in Italy with both pizzas. Nice flavor balance and the garlic on the marinara was on point. Half price mimosas also helped :) great experience and good service."}
{"text":"Was expecting a lot more from this place considering we waited well over an hour on a Tuesday night at 8:30 for a table [seated just before 10:00]. 

The atmosphere was great and our server was awesome, however the food was average at best.  My GF and I shared a Carpaccio to start which was pretty good but I have made much better myself.  I ordered the Nduja Sausage Pizza which was decent but really all I tasted was basil and the acidity from the tomatoes.  There was barely any cheese on the pizza and it was surprisingly doughy for a \"thin crust\" wood fired pizza.   The really didn't have much to it and fell to pieces if i tried to pick it up, as it was soggy from the watery tomato sauce.   

Overall I was satisfied with my meal but it was nothing special and not really worth the wait..."}
{"text":"This place is turning out awesome Neapolitan style pizzas using fresh, authentic ingredients and techniques. A great option for a casual no reservations type of dinner that consistently satisfies. The pizza is perfectly cooked with tasty options and flavourful crust. Venture into the starters and salads, you will not be disappointed. The calamari are crisp, tender and meaty, the  salads are fresh and vibrant."}
{"text":"Really really good Neapolitan pizza in Toronto. Crust is perfectly charred in places and toppings are simple and fresh. Recommend splitting a pizza and sharing a salad or appetizer with another and making sure you have room to try the tiramisu cup or vanilla affogato too. Can get a bit busy but cozy up to the bar and enjoy."}
{"text":"The Duck Confit was super tasty and a great flavour combo. Also tried the one with cayenne syrup and it was delightful. Fun afternoon spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to eat pizza in Toronto. Space is a premium but very friendly staff. Pizza comes quick and fresh, just plain delicious."}
{"text":"This excellent pizza joint in the less-traveled Ossington neighborhood makes great pizza with a following to show for it. Recommended by a couple of my local friends, the BF and I made the trek here around 9pm on a Saturday night. After waiting only for about 10 minutes or so (which we passed by enjoying craft cocktails next door), we sat down in the noisy back room.

Libretto boasts an oven that's Neopolitan certified (the materials come from Naples), and sure enough, produces top quality thin crust neopolitan pizza.  Their signature dish, the Duck Confit pizza, is a treat: juicy duck confit atop a white pie accented by tangy bosc pears. It's a great take on two complementary flavors and the product is a salty and savory treat. We also shared the grilled calamari (wholly excellent, with great flavors all around), and the Rocco's Salad (I felt this was a little small for two people to share, but it still had great texture and flavor).  Dessert looked tempting, but we saved room for ice cream sandwiches down the street.

With friendly servers and a lively atmosphere to boot, Libretto is great pizza, good food, and an overall positive experience.  Probably not the best place for a first date since it's pretty noisy (unless you grab a spot near the front), but will most likely satisfy your foodie friends.  Definitely would recommend to anyone living in or passing through Toronto."}
{"text":"It's a trendy little place and a sign of the changing times on Ossignton. We had to wait about 15 mins on a Saturday afternoon to get seated. The hostess was very good at her job: personable and efficient.

Our server was also very good: quick with the menu, our orders and the bill. She also consistently checked up on us, even though she was very busy.

The food was frankly a let down. Libretto's reputation precedes itself so I had very high expectations. We ordered the margherita pizza. I found it too salty. The thin crust was appealing but the salt was overpowering. I've had better pizza in Italy.

I liked the Lemon Penna Cotta (with raspberry reduction). It was creamy, light and just the right amounts of sweet and tangy. 

I also appreciated (and stole) the postcard that they clipped to the bill. 

I am going with 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service."}
{"text":"3 stars only because our server was pretty good. Our pizza took 45 mins to come out after we ordered. Burnt on the bottom and cold. A couple of tables arrived after us, ordered ate and left all before our pizza even came out. On a busy Saturday night slow service is understandable but to have at least 2 tables come in after us and leave before us is disappointing. Poor management of tables in my opinion. Kale salad appetizer was good."}
{"text":"I got taken out here during one of my first weeks back in Canada. The service was friendly (although slow due to the sheer amount of people) and they certainly were trying very hard.

I was little unimpressed by the prices of alcohol. Some glasses of wine cost the same as an order of pizza. The pizza itself was good. The crust was fresh and wonderfully made. The center was oddly soft, but I can't tell if that was the restaurant's style or it was slightly undercooked (didn't seem so). The toppings were to die for, so the crust wasn't a big deal.

Honestly, the pizza at Pizzeria Libretto really reminded me of the handmade pizza I ate in Korea. And while Korea's pizza usually hits the spot, it's not exactly the country for pizza.  Libretto is a wonderful place, but the pricing is what holds me back. I'm still gonna give it 4 stars because I believe the atmosphere and quality of ingredients and service is worth it."}
{"text":"This location has lots of seating but it's almost always busy. The pizza menu is not too expansive but there is a good selection. Nice wine and beer selection too. There's usually a pizza special. Service is friendly and faster than most downtown places. Prices are not bad for the area either. I enjoyed the pizza I ordered and will definitely return."}
{"text":"The good: Amazing pizza, I got the special which was a deep fried eggplant parmesan. It was $15, and I also got the Side Launch beer(i think that was the name) which was really good. Had a very unique banana finish. Also, their in-house chili olive oil is amazing, and can be purchased to take home for $5. Some of the best pizza Ive ever had in a very italian style.

The bad: The server asks if you want bread for the table, unlike most restaurants it's actually an appetizer that costs $10 which the server did not explain to us. We only found out on the bill. That's not very nice to see! I can also see the seating getting cramped in peak hours.

Verdict: amazing foods, decent seating, friendly servers. Only negative is the bread despite being delicious! Inform your patrons!"}
{"text":"This was going to be my first Neapolitan pizza in Toronto but overall experience was not pleasant at all. We ordered their homemade sausage pizza with mushroom and the buttermilk calamari. Food arrived within 5 minutes - not sure whether they cooked it that fast or  the foods were pre-cooked. I have had Neapolitan pizza through out US but Pizzeria Libretto's pizza was very soggy and the calamari was overcooked and very salty. Calamari's sauce was really good but the saltiness of the calamari was too much to handle. Overall the food was not something I would recommend to anyone. 

Would I try it again? May be I will give it a try again. I'm giving 2 stars to this place only because of the service and Because i might give it one more try at Pizzeria Libretto."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable experience.

Margarita pizza is great

Crazy busy most of the time... you'll have to arrive about an hour early on a busy night and maybe grab drinks at one of the local bars or diners on dundas"}
{"text":"I love love love their calamari. It's probably a million calories, but who cares. I had the creminininimini mushroom pizza, argula salad, calamari which i didnt want to share so damn good.

Food is great, atmosphere is lovely. 

only thing is that it took 30min for food to arrive, but the manager was very quick to recover, she offered us dessert and coffee on the house. Service was great, food was even better.

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ahh Pizzeria Libretto. How delicious. I think my girlfriend and I have tried most of the pizzas and they are simply delish! And the tiramisu should rip off the Lay's chips slogan. Bet you can't have just one. If you die and go to heaven, you will probably end up in this jar (yes jar) of tiramisu."}
{"text":"It was a bustling atmosphere so I'm glad that I made a reservation earlier. Food was great (had the beet caprese salad and salami pizza). They do recommend that the pizzas are for a single person but they are quite big. I was with another person so the salad and pizza were enough for us. But if you're really hungry then maybe having a single pizza for yourself will be enough. I would go again if I'm back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times over the years, and it is always consistently great. Fresh products and great service along with a nice menu with all the favs you could want in an Italian meal. I got the caprese salad and prosciutto pizza. Everything looks as amazing as it tastes. Finished off with a chocolate gelato that came with biscotte on the side. For the price, this is an amazing resto in this hood of overpriced underwhelming other options. The meat balls are also great, but each time I end up getting a pizza because they're consistently so yummy and well priced - plus who doesn't love leftovers!?!? The only thing I would suggest is to switch up the menu from time to time - since I've been there so many times, I know it off by heart and it doesn't change. Would be nice to see some seasonal offers."}
{"text":"Pretty decent and very hip spot downtown.  Pizza was flavorful but a bit soggy in the middle.
Update: have been reading about napoletana style pizza and since educated myself that traditional napoletana pizzas may have a slightly soggy centers.  With a bit of a refined pallette,  I've edited to 4 stars from 3!"}
{"text":"I loooove the pizza at Libretto!! Best in Toronto, hands down. Yes, the pizza IS better than Terroni's and so is the service!  Unfortunately I haven't had a chance to try the pasta because I can't seem to overcome my addiction to their Cremini Mushroom pizza. Ask for extra roasted garlic...you won't be disappointed! I've been to both locations and both experiences were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great service, nice ambience and delicious authentic Neapolitan pizza. 

They are always busy there so make sure you make a reso if you are going for lunch, otherwise you won't get back to work in a hour. The positive is they offer a prix fixe lunch menu! For only $25, you get an appie, (must try the pear arugula!) selected pizza (or choose any pizza on the menu for an additional $5) and a dessert!  My recommendation is to get the vanilla gelato and order an expresso separately to make an affrogato!!!  You will need the caffeine kick after all the yummy crispy pizza dough."}
{"text":"Good after work dinner spot but would not go out of my way to come here. Service is hit or miss, sometimes very personable and attentive sometimes pretty meh and standoffish. 

Highlights: kale salad, arugula salads are awesome! The margarita is probably the best pizza - safe yet good. Tiramisu for dessert is what I would recommend. 

They have a good local craft beer selections esp if you're into IPAs!

Average: I had the prosciutto arugula pizza which is so-so, and doesn't really come with cheese !! I've had the spicy sausage one as well, also only average. Aracinis were ok."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Libretto makes my favorite pizza. Though I must admit that I have been trying to find a back-up for a while now, and no pizza compares (though Pizzeria Defina is a close 2nd). So when I heard that a location was opening up on University and Queen, I was ecstatic!! I work 4 blocks from there! So I messaged a couple of colleagues and we agreed to check it out later that week. As soon as we decided the date, I gave Pizzeria Libretto a call and tried to make a reservation. I was told that they were completely booked the WHOLE week, but that I likely will not be waiting long since they reserve quite a few spots for walk-ins. So my colleagues and I squeezed into a cab and made the trip over. As soon as we arrived and requested a table for 4, we were told that the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour! It was 1pm! But since I had hyped this restaurant for weeks, my colleagues wanted to try the pizza. Luckily I was with two persistent colleagues who kept asking \"how much longer?\" Have you seen the movie with the obnoxious kids that keep asking, \"are were there yet?\" Yep, those were my colleagues. So we were seated at the bar after a 20 minute wait. Naturally, my colleagues could not settle for bar seats (it really is tough to talk at the bar), so they kept an eye out for a table--and when one opened up they ran to the hostess and pointed it out to her. Poor soul! I really did feel bad for the staff. But really, one got the impression that it was all about the hype, and trendy feel than the pizza. I have been to both the Ossington and Danforth locations a bunch of times (Danforth is my favorite---great service, and easy to make a reservation online), and at these locations the focus is on the food and great service. At the University one, the vibe gives you the feeling that it is all about being the cool kid in the expensive suit. But I guess it comes with the territory--it is the Queen and King business crowd. 

I can't wait for the hype to die over. Will update review in a couple of months."}
{"text":"First off dont go in large parties of single people because they do not do separte bills, which is rediculous.  Now to get to the service, it was great, they are very attentive with filling up your water glass.  Now for the pizza, i am a huge fan of good pizza, i was stoked to try it.  I had the Margherita pizza, and i know it is the most basic and traditional pizza but i thought it was limp and lacked flavour.  I also had the appetizer, the boccala, and being an italian, this is a fav dish of mine.  it was branded as being a salted fish and i wish the aioli that accompanied it wasnt so spicy because it really overpowered the saltiness.  Also, a little suggestion for the owners, i know u are trying to present a casual and relaxed atmosphere, but please splurge for wine glasses, i dont like drinking wine from a water glass."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special which is an awesome deal for $15. A generous margherita pizza which was DELICIOUS! Also, the Caprese salad and orange/cinnamon/esspresso gelato were awesome. It was crowded but not overly so. The crust is soft, but cooked perfectly in my opinion, chewy with a slightly smoky taste from the stone oven. I wish there were more basil on the pizza though! Overall a great place for lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"Very nice pizza joint in ossington. Went for the fixed lunch special $15 for a salad (beet or arugala), pizza (margherita / marinara) you can sub for any other pizza for $5, and biscotti or gelato (vanilla or chocolate). 

Pretty good deal! We ended up subbing for a nduja sausage and Ontario prosciutto & arugula pizza. Highly recommend both! However the Ontario pizza had a lot of salad on top making it hard to cut (then again both pizzas are thin so it was hard to cut either way). 

The sausage was a mild spicy just FYI. 

Gelato was meh. Plain flavors but what can you say when the special is so cheap?!  

Service is great. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"3 course prix fixe! The lunch special is a great deal. 3 courses for $16. 

The first course there's a choice of 2 salads, a predominantly tomato one, or a predominantly arugula one. 

Main course is pizza, which is either margherita or something equally boring. You can upgrade to a fun pizza for $5 extra. 

The dessert is a choice of gelato. Sometimes they have a special gelato that is $1-2 extra. 

They have wine and it's good. Service can be good or slow, depending on who is working, so if you're in a rush you may want to sit inside and not on the patio because sometimes they forget about you out there. 

Their patio is in an alleyway so it's not as crazy as patios right on King, which is nice. 

Overall this place is delicious. I definitely recommend the prix fixe."}
{"text":"Despite it's incredible popularity, I have managed to only ever eat at Pizzeria Libretto twice. The first time I visited was when they first opened. It was busy, but manageable. We got a table quite quickly and I walked away satisfied, but feeling that the food was comparable to Terroni despite the cozier setting and less hurried service.

More recently, I returned for a late lunch and once again managed to avoid the line up that quickly formed once we were seated. I found this experience to be similar to the one from a couple years ago. Our server was extremely personable and gave highly enthusiastic wine suggestions right off the bat. (Staff tastings really pay off!) She also seemed genuinely excited for our caprese salad and pizza selections of margherita and proscuitto.

I hardly feel compelled to become a regular, but Pizzeria Libretto has proven itself to be a solid spot to bring out-of-towners. It's casual without being too cheap (or expensive) and the food and service are better than what you can find elsewhere on the Ossington strip (for less)."}
{"text":"Mama Mia! This place is top notch!

I can say without hyperbole that Libretto is the best pizza I've ever had. A friend from Milan actually recommended it saying it was the best he's ever had too!

Even though it was crazy busy the service was impeccable! This is key. 

Roccos salad to start, followed by the perfectly cooked and spicy Speducci was a killer combo before we got the djua sausage pizza for the knockout. 

You can see and taste the quality here. The tomatoes are freshly grated, the bread made in house, and it's all made in a wood oven, properly.

I wanted to scarf the pizza down, but it was do good that I knife and forked that mother to make it last longer. 

Our waiter was genuinely excited to hear that it was our first visit and he could not wait to suggest the rainbow of flavors. 

Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza Libretto!!! If you want some quality pizza this is the place to go! I had went to the Pizza Libretto on 155 University tonight. It was good; however, I would still prefer the Ossington location. I have to say this place is just a little shy of the \"Wow Factor!\" I had gotten the Duck Confit, which was very delicious and enjoyable! Will definitely come here when I am craving pizza! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the buttermilk Calamari and the Nduja sausage pizza- it was so delicious with the chile oil. Will definitely be back. Calamari was nicely cooked and not over battered with red pepper sauce. The pizza was just the right texture and spice level with lots of flavours. Seating was quick, no reservation required on a Saturday night, but it was a little busy so call ahead just incase. Service was quick and friendly, staff were very attentive. Great atmosphere, a little loud, but still quite hip."}
{"text":"The place is a hidden champion.
I was at the bar and had a great dinner. Btw, watching hockey Canada vs. Russia.

Service? Patient, quick and good.
Food? Pizza is all about at this place. And it's great. Not Italian, as not thin and crusty enough. More the North American style.
Drinks? Perfct. Great wine list. I had a Sangiovese from Umbria. Perfect match to the pizza.
Place? Excellent. Nothing fancy. But right to the spot. 

Overall: Recommandation! Go get there and try it out."}
{"text":"Ok so its my very first review on Yelp. Usually I don't review but this one was worth it  Best pizza so far in Toronto i have had! Everything was good, the arugula salad, the prosciutto pizza and the amazing cinnamon espresso gelato. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the service was very slow. Hopefully better next time."}
{"text":"The only place I can eat pizza without worrying about my gluten, dairy, egg and soy allergies! I frankly don't bother eating pizza anywhere else."}
{"text":"THEIR PIZZA SUCKS.

The 550 Danforth Libretto pizza is not that good at all.  What a bummer, we didn't like it!  The pizza is like cheap pita bread that's in an oven for a few seconds.

No clue why there's claims it's so good.  I don't even remember tasting pizza in Italy like this."}
{"text":"I grew in Philadelphia eating delicious greasy east coast style pizzas.  When I want REAL pizza i hit up  Big Slice on bloor, These pies at PL really has nothing do do with that. I just ate a  tiny-ass  like maybe 12 inch pizza for $20 covered in speck, gorgonzola, figs , honey, walnuts, and greens...I had to ask the man what speck was ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speck  )....  But, MAN was that good...pretension aside .. they balance opposing  flavours brilliantly and the crust.is beautiful dance of  tough and  soft"}
{"text":"If you want good solid pizza give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't worth the experience.

Positives:
- The arugula, pear, walnut and piave insalate, which was perfectly dressed.
- Water was consistely refilled.
- I liked the tables.
- Duck of the duck confit pizza was perfectly cooked.

Negatives:
- Felt rushed.
- The crust of the pizza was mediocre.
- Long wait (and I went on a Monday), no reservations.
- Serving size of salumi was... sad.

It was a good and decent meal, but I would only go back if I had a lot of time to spare, and if it wasn't such an event to get a table."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Libretto since it first opened a few years ago and we had to come right at 5pm when it opened to avoid the lines and get a table.

Now that the hype has died down, I'm happy to say that we didn't have to eat at a senior citizen's dining time as there were seats a bit later around 6pm-ish on a Thursday.

Came with Daniel O before an Elite event in the area.  Shared the Margherita pizza ($13) and the calarami appetizer ($11).  I remember the pizza being soggy in the centre during my first visit way back when but there was no issues this time.

Service was very friendly and orders came out super fast!  

Happy to see that Libretto is doing well and on their way to a second location in the city."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this brief since this restaurant has many reviews.  

We tried the Potato & Ricotta Gnocchi with Oxtail, the Beef Carpaccio and the Buttermilk Calamari.  The Gnocchi was my favourite of the three and I would order it again over the others.  It was very light with a delicious \"stew-like\" sauce which tastes like beef (for those of you who are afraid to try Oxtail). 

The standout, however, was the Cremini Mushroom pizza.  Next time, I am ordering one all for myself and I'm not sharing!  It was outstanding.  Perfect.  My mouth is watering writing this...

The dessert special of the day (rhubarb tart with vanilla gelato) was also very well executed."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, vast selection of wines and beers and of course, Neapolitan pizza! Started off with the kale salad and it was literally the best I ever had. The salad is massaged in a creamy lemon chili vinagrette and topped with crispy chickpeas. 

Had the salami pizza and was pretty disappointed. The salami was deep fried and tasted like burnt bacon. And the pizza wasn't as flavorful as I hoped."}
{"text":"The crusts at this pizza restaurant are more soggy, and I prefer more crisp crusts. Flavours of the topping were nice though. 

The fried doughnuts rolled in sugar was pretty good."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm probably the last person on Yelp to review this place, but I FINALLY had the chance to eat here so I might as well add my 2 cents.

Food is 5 star, in my opinion. Pizzas were delicious - crust is extremely thin, slightly charred (intentionally) on the outer bits. Cheese is sparse, tomato sauce is plentiful and tasty. So it meets all my pizza must-haves criteria (thin crust, good sauce, not too much cheese) 

The lunch special is a really, really good deal (Choice of two salads, a margharita pizza and a gelato for $15. Upgrade to any other pizza on the menu for $20)

The beet caprese salad was impressive, made with white beets and a really mild, non-salty mozzarella. 

I tried the prosciutto with arugula pizza. Could only finish half. Toppings were good - extremely thin sliced prosciutto but covered the entire pizza, lots of arugula and just a sprinkling of some kind of hard grated cheese over top. 

My boy had the sausage pizza and he thought it was amazing. We are regulars at Queen Margharita and we both preferred the pizza here, although it's a close call.

I also tried the espresso gelato, which was served in a small glass and was just enough to hit the spot without making me overly full.

The service was a wee bit slow but not bad. It's impossible to get a damn seat here. I've tried coming 4-5 times and always told there was a 1 hour wait. I guess lunch is the best time to stroll in because we finally got lucky.

I would definitely go back if I could actually count on getting a table. Looking forward to trying to Danforth location!

Tables are set a little bit too close together, so it's a bit cosy and other conversations can be overheard. So don't expect a lot of privacy."}
{"text":"One of my go to pizzerias for a delicious, inexpensive, and filling meal. I've been to this location on multiple occasions and everyone i've brought here has a had a pleasant experience as well. I've ordered the fried gnocchi (without the sausage i believe it comes with) more than once and it is incredible! The basic san marzano and basil are surprisingly flavourful. The melanzana pizza is also one of my new favourites. I would recommend trying to get seated near the window as the environment gets louder the closer to the back you go, plus you can people watch! All the staff i've encountered have been extremely nice and the service is good, wait times i feel are shorter than expected which is always a pleasant treat! Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here with a friend or date to enjoy a nice dinner that'll leave you more than satisfied without emptying your wallet! ** super vegetarian friendly without having to alter the menu too much, while still having an abundance of what I've heard are great meat options as well!"}
{"text":"They got really good food!!! I love the spicy sausage pizza(nduja sausage)!!! And got the \"flank steak splendini\" and \"buttermilk fried calamari as appetizer!! Definitely worth 5 star rate!!! Servers are friendly! Good recommendation!"}
{"text":"I came here for a date recently and had high expectations because of the hype. I have to admit that the wine was not great at all (selection and taste). The pizza was pretty good, but it didn't taste any better than the other pizza joints in the city. It was fine...quite soggy in the middle and lacking...something...depth, I guess. 
The vibe was good and the waiter was really lovely. I can't say I'd go back, but it was okay."}
{"text":"Went with my friend to try this place cause kept hearing good reviews

Atmosphere was awesome. Great place to take a date. I was with my boy, so man-date? Staff was friendly and very helpful on recommendations form the menu.

Pizza was pretty good. Its been a while since writing the review (I'm honest, been busy with work and a few other things keeping me from exposing where I was eating at specific times). I put the 5 star but wrote this later - I remember the pizza was good. I'm sorry... don't be angry... I tried :'(

Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for out of town guests. Lucy P is the best server ever. Customize your pizza. Make good choices."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place so low because the service was flat out HORRIBLE tonight. I'm always generous with gratuity, but I only left 10% tonight and that was kind. Believe me, she didn't check on my table once. The drink I ordered at the start didn't come until after the bread was eaten, the salad was eaten, and the pizza came and was eaten. We were done, then our drink comes? Going out should be a nice experience, I liked the pizza and the salad, but I'll have to give my business to a place that values their customers."}
{"text":"Excellent and original pizzas and menu. I would not say that these are the best pizzas in Toronto or Canada, but these are definitively the most original ones, made only with quality ingredients, and with unusual but great combinations of flavors for sure. I just miss a longer pizza menu choice, including more basic \"mamma's\" pizzas, like quatro sesoni, to add this possibility. Appetizers and desert are great also (though smaller size). Service is really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place seems to be perpetually packed. If busyness is your thing, you'll like it here. I didn't find that it affected the quality of service here because I thought the service was very good and the staff quite friendly.

The pizza itself was a little bleh. The thing with these pizzas is that they are thin, and because they are thin they can burn easily. And when they burn, even just a little, you get that gross charcoal taste. And when every other bite contains that taste, it just isn't that great of an experience.

I was thinking of giving this place 4 stars, but its closer to a 3.4 so I rounded down. The thing is, as gross as many people think a place like Pizza Pizza is, I at least have never gotten a burnt slice of pizza there. When you are paying more than double that at Libretto, you do expect a little more quality and a little less charcoal."}
{"text":"Loved. 

But not 5 star material, which means loved enough to make me remember what I had exactly. 

Still... an amazing pizza stop."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the city! Simply so delicious... Definitely check this place out. The line during peak hours can be long so don't go super hungry, but well worth the wait! Also, if you have room after dinner, you must try the tiramisu.... It's actually life changing.
Life changing."}
{"text":"I was a little bit disappointed by the food here. I shared the arancini and the nduja sausage pizza with my friend after a round of squash. The arancini were pretty good (how can you mess up deep fried balls of rice and cheese), but the pizza was meh. It was really greasy and soggy. The crust was decent, but that was the best part of the pizza (and it shouldn't be). I did like the crusty bread which is brought to the table at the beginning. It was nice and fresh. Our server was also extremely unfriendly and didn't crack a smile the entire time. I felt almost a little uncomfortable with how short and cold she was. You don't have to chat away with us, but it's just nice to say hi and welcome. I probably won't be back, since there are so many good pizza places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely over hyped. Their pizza was nothing special at all, even pizza hut is better. I got the margarita and it was the thinnest pizza i've ever had making it so hard to eat. Over priced too and there was barely any cheese. I truly don't understand the hype and I will never go back."}
{"text":"Came here a little while ago for a Yelp UYE, on the recommendation of a fellow Yelper and Neapolitan pizza connoisseur. While I myself am not even a huge fan of this style of pizza (to the disgust of certain pizza snobs I know), I was quite impressed and satisfied with both the food and the experience at Libretto.

SERVICE:

Service was stellar. They were willing to accommodate two large tables of approximately 10 per person, and food came out fairly quickly, especially for a place as busy as this was on a Friday night. The server was informative, taking the time to answer questions, and even educating some of us on their offerings and history.  

While I'm philosophically and adamantly opposed to the \"auto-gratuity policy,\" which this place had at 18% for large groups, I appreciated that the server waived it when she heard some of us chatting about it - I ended up giving her this % tip anyway, but because the server EARNED it, rather than as a pre-established requirement. 

FOOD:

I ordered the \"Cacciatore Salami\" Neapolitan, which had Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella in addition to said Salami. The crust was thin and a bit charred, as is the style, and different than some other similar places, actually gave a decent amount of salami - Simon needs his MEAT dammit! It was baked and seasoned well with herbs, and had enough cheese. 

As I said, I'm not a huge Neapolitan pizza guy, but for those that care about this sort of thing, this place has all the certifications (Vera Pizza Napoletana) to authenticate the quality of its ingredients and preparation etc. This place also has a nice dessert selection, which I definitely partook in.

VERDICT:

Will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I walked in Pizzeria Libretto for the first time and saw that they are owned by the same owner as Enoteca Sociale and I was a bit bothered since Enoteca Sociale left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, but it turns out that Pizzeria Libretto had none of those failings.

To be fair, their pizza is not the best pizza I've ever had, but the pizza _is_ good, and the entire experience is fantastic.  We got:
- quinoa salad ($6) 
- gnocchi fritta ($6)
- nduja sausage pizza ($17)
- two pints of organics

So the pizza is a bit on the pricey side since it's thin slice, but $50 for two people after tax and tip wasn't too bad. My friend said he wasn't full, but he wasn't hungry either.

The nduja sausage was recommended by our server and it was definitely a great recommendation. The food overall was great and the ambiance is fantastic."}
{"text":"OK.   Yet again - thank you King west for bringing what I want and love to me.

Built upon the same great za from ossington, the food doesn't disappoint.  I dunno if they have a wider appetizer menu at this location, but we ordered literally every one and it was a treat to such an array of taste buds adventures. 

Solid drafts.   Nut darks to Muskoka ales.  I'll keep coming back.  Such a great place for a party or group!

Cheers Libretto!!!"}
{"text":"Had previously walked in a couple times only to find a super long wait for a table so I was stoked to visit on a Sunday afternoon for my first time  - the place was quiet. 
Ordered the buttermilk calamari to start which was fantastic - crispy with a flavourful batter and a great sauce.
Next was the Njuda (sausage) Pizza - loved the flavour of the sausage however I found the pizza to be soggy and undercooked. I asked the server if the crust was supposed to be bread like soft and she said yes - I find this hard to believe. She offered to have new pizzas made for both of us but we declined. It seems several of the reviews here have also encountered soft, and soggy undercooked pizza. The person I was with has been to the Ossington location several times and said the crust is usualy somewhat crispy, and not like how it was that day.
I will try the Ossington location next time to see if it is any better as I am suprised such a highly rated pizza joint would serve such an averge pie."}
{"text":"We went for a quick lunch between some meetings. It was quite busy but we got a table shortly.

Their pizzas are so unique -The dough adds a unique flavour to the Neapolitan pizzas! We went for the Kale Salad, Arancini (can you ever go wrong with that?) and a Nduja pizza.¬†

Each item was well prepared and I could keep going back just for the Arancini!"}
{"text":"This place was good. The service was slow and somewhat inattentive, but very friendly. The pizzas with nduja sausage were good and I added one additional meat on each of the two pizzas. The drink I ordered was very good too. My only gripe is that it is pricey. I believe I paid $70 including tip for two people, which is too much for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Pizza the way I love it: thin crust with fresh and creative toppings!

I was one of a party of 3, dining on a rainy evening - I think we were lucky, because the wait was just a bit under 5 minutes.

We started with the calamari, which was lightly battered and fried - and the red pepper almond sauce was a delightful twist!
The three of us each ordered a pizza, and shared: Grilled Eggplant, Ontario Ricotta Di Bufala, and Prosciutto & Arugula.  Let me tell you - the surprise of the bunch - even without cheese, the peppery arugula and the salty meat came together and made that pizza irresistible.  And I love me some cheese.  Speaking of, the Ricotta was the lightest, freshest ricotta ever.  One of my friends mentioned that he thinks they make it fresh themselves - this sort of dedication to fresh ingredients gets a big check mark in my books.

Service was attentive and friendly.  There wasn't an overwhelming wait, but given the rumours I had heard about the line-ups, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they never rushed us, and continued to refill our waters when we just wanted to hang out and chat.  Again, I think we were pretty lucky in that it wasn't too too busy.

Finally, while I'm no wine expert, we had plenty of the Rosso Toscana \"Il Bosco\", and it was a great accompaniment to our meal.

Great portions - had a great lunch the next day :)"}
{"text":"Yes, I think the 3.5 stars for the food is the right rating, rounded up to 4 *s for the great service.

The pizza at Libretto is comparable to Terroni's, but I prefer Terroni's because the pizza crust at Libretto's arrives a bit too soggy. The problem with thin crust pizza is that unless the crust and the sauce is perfect, the center of the crust will get soggy really quickly. I really love thin crust pizza, so I'm willing to work with this, but if texture is really important to you, then this will throw you off.

Except for the very center, the rest of the pizza was just fine. I ordered the hot peppers and sausage pizza. The hot peppers added just a bit of kick to the pizza (I still added chili oil because well, I looove spicy food). 

The restaurant is really cute and warm. It reminded me of the great little restaurants you would find in the East Village or Alphabet City in NY. The space is narrow and tight, but everything is still very refined. I think the best table in the house is the one by the bay windows. The table is up higher than your average table (with appropriately sized chairs), so it feels more like you're at the bar. 

The service here is really good; I can't complain about that. Definitely a notch above Terroni. I loved that they gave us water in the reusable glass carafes (a la Alice Waters's Chez Panisse), but I wish the water was cold instead of lukewarm. On one of the hottest nights of the summer, you want a long cool drink. Tepid won't do.

It's a great restaurant and addition to this Ossington neighborhood. A really good and solid date place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times. The pizza is always delicious. Service is friendly and knowledgeable. The space is upscale casual. it's really nicely done. They make a fun pizza dough puff for an appetizer.  Just ask."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place. The waiter knew the menu inside out and they gave great recommendations!  I had this beet salad with a fried egg on top and also the arugala pizza. Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing I don't live on Ossington, cus if I did, Libretto and I would be seeing each other weekly.

Duck confit pizza is amazing - crispy but still soft inside, with just the right amount of toppings. even better is their signature chili oil that you drizzle all over your pizza (I could drink this stuff). We also ordered a tower of their buttermilk calamari which was devoured in minutes. Well breaded and fried crispy, without cheaping out on the meat inside. 

Paired with a few beers, this will be one of the best pizza parties you will ever have !

Would I return? - Yes, definitely!
Parking? - Street parking on Ossington
Value for $? - Good
Space? - Medium sized/limited waiting area (they will take your number and text you when the table is ready so you can walk the strip while waiting or grab a beer at one of the many other bars nearby)
Ventilation? - So so (aka you will smell a bit like food after)
Service? - Great"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, love the place, and it has a special place in my heart. 

get the spicy oil for the pizza and if you're really nice they will bring you free alcohol. 

I love this place"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city. The flavours are so authentic and delicious.
Always such a wait, but we don't mind grabbing a drink while we wait. They will text you when your table is coming up. There are so many great bars on Ossington.
Dessert selection could be better. You are there for the pizza, so who has room for dessert anyways?"}
{"text":"I stil remember not too long ago when \"the oz\" was a grimey ghetto area. things have certainly change for the better with places like libretto setting up shop here. It kind of reminds me of Clement st in San Francisco. To reiterate past reviews about long long wait times during peak hours, yes it's true but def worth it to try the Neapolitan style pizza here. The proper size thin crust pizza, means for us north americans, its too damn small so we need to order other great dishes on the menu. If you can appreciate quality cheeses i recommend this place.I dont think they use Kraft mozzarella here. I really enjoyed the anchovy and chilli pepper pizza. I find the anchovies were not salty at all which is usually the case when you order this topping from other pizza places. The chilli pepper adds a nice kick but not deadly mouth burner. 

After a nice meal at libretto head down the oz for a drink or two at some of their many hipster bars."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to try the \"best pizza\" in every city I'm in and if you ask around Toronto where the best pie is, Libretto will be the place that rolls off most people's tongues.  

For dinner, expect a wait, but for lunch you'll not only be promptly seated by an accommodating staff, you can also dine on the prix fixe menu: choice of salad, Margherita or Marinara pie and dessert, all for $15.  A great deal for what Libretto calls \"Real Neapolitan Pizza,\" which translates as flash baked pies in an authentic 900 degree wood burning oven.  The pizza may very well be the best in Toronto, but be warned: it ain't going to knock the socks off a Napolitano, New Yorker (Di Fara), Angeleno (Mozza) or San Franciscan (Una).

As for the rest of the prix fixe, the lunch Caprese Salad with Beets lacks flavour thanks to mozzarella that's rubbery and bland and the chocolate gelato (prepared on the premises) is chalky and soft enough to be mistaken for soft-serve.  

Libretto is a safe bet for a decent pie in a land not known for exceptional pizza.  I would never go out of my way to recommend this place, but odds are you'll find me eating there a couple times a month.  What the he**, it's nearby, the prices are reasonable, the service is solid, the decor is inviting, and until someone points me to better pie in TO, Libretto will keep my pizza jones under control."}
{"text":"Went back to Pizzeria Libretto for dinner tonight and I still have no complaints! My friend and I arrived around 5:45pm on a Wednesday and we had no problem getting a table at the back, although it did start to fill up pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend getting here before 6 or after 9 if you don't want to have to wait for a table. 

We split the arancini to start, which I believe was a special as it's not on the regular menu. The arancini arrived on a bed of tomato sauce that complemented the flavours perfectly. Sooo good. We also shared the verdura pizza, a white pizza with mozzarella and goat cheese and topped with a seasonal vegetable (which was asparagus). The asparagus gave the pizza a really light, refreshing flavour, perfect for a warm summer day. To finish off my meal I had a vanilla affogato, which was a lovely, refreshing blend of sweet and bitter.

Service was fast and friendly from start to finish, and I appreciate the fact that if a server other than your own notices there is an empty plate in front of you he/she will not hesitate to take it away. Go, team! I also really like that the servers here make sure to let you know if the pizza you are ordering comes without cheese or tomato sauce, etc. so that there are no surprises later on. And seriously...is being very good-looking a requirement to work here? Everyone is so beautiful! 

Total for a completely satisfying meal for two came to $50 with tax and tip. I'm already planning my next return visit..."}
{"text":"Hype is a bitch.

Most of the time, its existence compels me to stay far away until the dust has settled, until I have a chance to judge the thing in question from as pure and unbiased a position as possible. 

I have allowed all talk of this hallowed pizzeria on the incomparable Ossington strip to fade quietly into the background for a couple of years now. One of my dearest friends recently tried it for the first time and she swore I had to try it, that I had never had anything like it. 
Her response being so genuine and enthusiastic, it became quite contagious.

The night we tried, we (of course) could not get a table, and went across the street \"for a drink\" while my cellphone sat at the corner of our table in dizzy anticipation.

Drinks turned into burgers and I finally got a call 2.5 hours later (they said it would be 40 minutes to an hour), while back at home, and in my pajamas: \"we have a spot at the bar that just opened up if you're still interested.\" Hmm. That's gotta be some damn good pizza!

Cut to a few months later and I end up there on a whim with a different group. Excitement does not even begin to cover it. I cannot believe how lucky we are to even be sitting here! the dipping oil for the bread is unlike any other! the bread is so soft and fresh, the coca cola...a little watery and almost flat. Fitting punishment I guess, for those of us too cheap to order wine in stylish stemless glasses.

And then...as my sister said:  \"I could see the disappointment in your eyes when it got to the table.\" But that's not the extent of it, because I would never judge food based on looks alone. I was expecting the arugula to be sauteed or something, not just dumped on there BUT THAT WASN'T MY PROBLEM. Am I too critical? Is there something wrong with ME because I thought the menu could use a little variety (almost non-existent non-meat /non-pork options), and while quite tasty, the crust was slightly soggy and maybe a touch too burnt? That my prosciutto-laden pie was a little too salty? That my sister's duck confit and pear was sorely lacking in pear? That just because something is kinda different and more \"authentic\" than the other varieties it's competing with, that doesn't give it an automatic \"genius\" pass?? 

I liked it, I really did. But I want you to know that I really wanted to love it. Life-changingly and all that jazz.

F- you, hype. Way to mess with a perfectly pleasant pizza-eating experience."}
{"text":"PL was recommended to my girlfriend and I by a friend, so we decided to check it out for lunch on a Saturday. Initially, we had a bad feeling there would be a wait because 1) it was a weekend and 2) the ratings are above average. We were pleased, however, when we got in and were seated immediately.

The inside had a very laid-back layout, with a friendly, family feel. Seating is primarily bench-style, but they have some high tables with stools and also a bar. 

The service was great right from the start. We were immediately served water, after choosing still water when asked, \"still or sparkling?\". We were given ample time to decide what we wanted, and our server was very patient and helpful when it came to deciding our order. She gave her personal recommendations, asked us about our ingredient preferences, and double checked for allergies before noting down our order. We went with the Cremini Mushroom for our pizza, and Flank Steak Speidini as an appetizer. 

The pizza arrived before the starter (we told her she could bring the food in any order), and I hear it's ready in about 90 seconds, given the thin crust and nature of the dough. I half wish we'd been told the pizza we went for wasn't Marinara based, but it was pretty delicious nonetheless. We did, however, ask for a side of marinara sauce, which was worth the $1 extra. 

Our steak appetizer arrived shortly after, and consisted of three skewers of steak and sourdough. The steak was rare, very slightly on the chewy side, but I wouldn't say that was an issue - it was still tasty, and went well with the pizza. 

We were able to take our time eating and finishing up as there wasn't much rush, and were overall very satisfied. I will be coming back to try tomato/marinara sauce based pizza sometime soon, though! 

The bill came to just about $30 for the Cremini Mushroom pizza and the Flank Stake Speidini appetizer. Not bad!"}
{"text":"So many people were hyping up this place for me but unfortunately it fell flat. 

The bread they give you to start was great - I could probably eat it forever if I wanted to. Ordered the calamari because everyone seemed to have ordered it - was pretty good! The sauce was great. Things were starting off really well. 

Then the pizza came, we ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza and the homemade sausage pizza. There was something missing in the taste of the prosciutto and arugula pizza, and the tomato sauce was a little too strong. The homemade sausage was a bit better (more cheese?) but mad oily. Needless to say the pizzas were quite disappointing and not something I'd come back for."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto so far! I asked for the eggplant pizza without cheese and had it replaced with mushrooms instead, they were ultra accommodating about it  - loved the thin flavorful crust, Very European style! My dinner companion is visiting from Rome and she ate her entire pizza margherita and gave it the thumbs up! 
I too am Italian born and travel to Europe regularly and while I have had some amazing pizzas in Europe, this one definitely meets the standard. 
Quality food, Friendly service and the lively informal atmosphere, ensure that I'll be back~We had an excellent glass of wine next door at Salt (Which looks like a good place to try for dinner also). They said our table would be ready in 15 minutes, we got a text the second our wine arrived ( maybe 5 minutes later?) so we still took our time. On a busier night I'd call them back, or gulp the drink down, this was a Wednesday and even though they had given our table away by the time we finished our vino and payed, they had another one ready! I didn't give it 5 stars because the seating and decor were Not that comfortable or visually appealing. 
But I'd eat that fresh eggplant pizza again right now :)"}
{"text":"The best thin crust margarita pizza on the planet.  There is never enough seating, so go early or be prepared to wait 45 min for a table.  Staff are super friendly despite the chaos of the ultra packed restaurant."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I came for dinner last night to give Libretto our first try. We arrived at 6:00 to find the place starting to fill up. There was no line at this point and we were seated immediately towards the back. 

The server got us some water and left us to our menus. Despite how busy they were there was no rush for use to order and things felt nicely casual in the bustling restaurant. My dining companion and I decided to share a few things so that we could try a larger portion of the menu. We started with the gnocchi and calamari and for our pizzas chose the Ontario Prosciutto and the White Sardine. 

The gnocchi was excellent. Nice and tender morsels topped with a deliciously salty meat sauce and topped with cheese to add a good bite on your palette. The calamari had a cool presentation being stacked into a tower on top of the sauce. Unfortunately the dish was a let down. The breading on the pieces was quite thick and heavy, almost like I was eating a chewy onion ring. 

Both pizzas were excellent. I love basil and wished the prosciutto pizza had more on it. While I'm not a fan of sardines the pizza was good. The fish added saltiness but the fishy taste was made mild by the other flavours on the pie. 

We were offered dessert but couldn't even manage to look at the menu we had eaten so much. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten dinner in Toronto a total of two times, and both of those times were at Pizzeria Libretto-- this time we chose the King Street location, though. 

Their new patio was quiet and comfortable, and our waiter was very attentive (although the sparkling water I ordered never materialized). 

The pizza was as good as we'd remembered, but the beef carpaccio--which we'd ordered the first time we visited as well-- was slightly diminished. We'd just had the most amazing (and much more expensive) carpaccio at a different meal earlier in the week, so our perception of its quality was certainly influenced by that. I'd still recommend if you're looking for a plate of it, though!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pizzeria Libretto (the Danforth location) before a few years ago and enjoyed it, but last night did not live up to the great pizza I remembered. 

I had the grilled eggplant pizza with basil, chili flakes, and ricotta salata. I've had eggplant on pizza before and love how it turns soft and creamy when cooked - but this eggplant was tough and hard to bite into. I also wish the cheese had been cooked on the pizza rather than just shaved on top, because it fell off while eating. So I was left with an undercooked, soggy crust topped with tough eggplant and no cheese. 

On the plus side, the service and atmosphere were great and my boyfriend really enjoyed his salami pizza."}
{"text":"Highly unimpressed and confused about all the hype. My pizza was like soup, with burnt crusts and no cheese or sauce anywhere but the middle (hence the soup like consistency). 
The Beef Carpaccio was really salty and $2 to add arugula is absurd!

The wine list was very limited and we tasted 3 different whites before we SETTLED for a $52 bottle of something I could barely choke back. The seating feels like you're in a food court. Very close together, basic tables.

Would never go again."}
{"text":"Love this Libretto. Love them both but prefer the OSSINGTON to the Danforth location (in case you are thinking of making a comparison).

Will have to return soon. Love their pies and the atmosphere is great for a Thursday after work bite.

I RECOMMEND:
The Nduja Sausage for a medium hot sausage pie 
or
The Ontario Prosciutto if you wanna keep it mild but savoury

EXTRA TIP: Leave the personal bubble at home. This place goes for small, busy, noisy and patrons are guaranteed to sit pretty closely together. Part of the charm though."}
{"text":"The best Gluten Free Pizza crust I have ever had. Pizza is hands down my favourite food. I travel a lot and am always on the search for good gluten free pizza which is not easy to find. Pizza Libretto is in my regular rotation of Toronto restaurants as nothing else compares to their GF pizza. 

The service is consistent and excellent, the staff is friendly and accommodating. 

I highly recommend Pizza Libretto."}
{"text":"I just LOVE Lunch Specials! 

Pizzeria Libretto Lunch Menu ($15) is such a good bargain.. (+ 1 star) 

No wait on a Friday lunch time... got to sit at the bar... 

Arugula Salad (+1 star) 
- Love how it was lightly dressed with tons of fresh pears and walnuts.. 
- makes me feel I am eating so healthy.. but in 5 minute or so I going to stuff my face with a whole pizza 

Margherita D.O.P (-2 star) 
- I know the restaurant is busy.. yes even for lunch it is packed 
- but really, seriously why is my pizza so freaking burnt??!! one side of the crust was like charcoal black and the burnt bits like ashes crumbles under my touch..... (see my photos!) 
- please don't tell me that Canadians here like to have burnt pizza?? and even the bottom is burnt to in some part to a certain degree.... 
- Pizzeria Libretto's management really need to work on some quality control... and please don't burn my pizza again.... please... 
- I cut out all the burnt part and have it piled on my side dish.... my waitress just gave me the look.. I hope she won't tell me that's the best part of the pizza... 
- Pizza itself is quite good, the crust is so thin and light ...one of the thinnest crust I ever have outside of Italy 

Vanilla Gelato (+1 star) 
- I am all cool again when they feed me the gelato. Gelato so creamy and heavenly 

I would happy to give Pizzeria Libretto another try but only during lunch time... I will have to tell the kitchen NOT to burn my pizza... I will wait patiently for my food.. please don't ruin my lunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after the movies.  Great pizza and the desert was delicious.  Our service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Service was fine, music was fine, food was fine. I just wasn't blown away, and have a hard time understanding why this place was once so popular! The other location is said to have lines out the door on summer nights, and I just don't get it. Sure, it's better than Pizza Pizza and the prices match that expectation, but it's not stellar. 

The pizza combinations aren't innovative, and are clearly designed to be crowd pleasers. The waiters are polite, but reserved. The salads and desserts are good, but tiny.  

That being said, it's not awful, and I've been back a few times. It's similar to a Terroni of the city- you walk by, you're hungry, you're on a date maybe, and are trying to find a place that at the very least isn't offensive. You go in, and talk about something other than the food because that's like talking about the weather. Meh. Could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"We'll call it the magic of Ossington. It's with the magic of Ossington that this place was only open two days and was ALREADY filled to capacity. And that same magic has continued to keep Libretto consistently busy throughout the couple weeks it has been opened.

But maybe it's not the magic of Ossington as much as it's the magic of Pizzeria Libretto. They have every right to be busy -- it's owned by a successful chef who has an amazing resume (and owns the considerably pricier Silver Spoon on Roncesvalles), it has a small menu of dishes that boast fresh, seasonal ingredients, and everything is simple and sensational all at once. They make delicious pizzas comparable to pizza I've had in Rome, and even in the little middle-of-nowhere town my family is from. 

All the pizzas are Italian classics or are topped with classic Italian ingredients - the Quattro Stagione, Fungi Pizza, pizzas with prosciutto, sardines, arugula and home-made sausage. They have a couple more gourmet items, like Duck Confit and homemade Duck Proscuitto, but the majority of the menu can please both food snobs and food enthusiasts alike. And their calamari appetizer is to-die-for!

The restaurant itself is relatively small but cozy. The front wall is covered in chalkboard paint and scribbles from happy customers. As you'll probably be waiting a while if you don't make reservations, be careful not to lean on that wall -- I've done it at least 3 times!

The great thing about this place is it's simplicity -- they make good food that has nothing fancy about it, and yet it's so much better than food that overdoes it. 

So it makes sense that it's busy all the time. But you can also get take-out, which I am definitely going to try sometime soon since it's the closest pizza place to home. Here's hoping this place stays busy and stays open -- it's a great addition to the northern Ossington strip!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and never disappointed. The pizza is always amazing and same with the pear arugula salad. Best deal for the price and amount of food you get is the lunch special during the week."}
{"text":"\"I ordered a gluten-free Duck Confit pizza ($18 plus $4 extra for gluten-free crust). Mon Dieu! I'm still thinking about it days later. Firsty, I had a hard time believing that the dough was gluten-free and had to double-check with the server, who assured me it was. Apparently, Agostino spent many sleepless nights perfecting the recipe. The pizza, stretched to a precise 35-centimeter diameter that would be make the Italian Government proud, arrived in all its glory. The crust was perfectly blistered and lightly charred. Although I'm a mademoiselle with etiquette, I decided to forgo my knife and fork so I could test the elasticity. The dough was thinnest in its centre--making it best for picking up with the hands and folding. Although the meager sprinkling of duck was tr√®s dry, the combination of summery sweetness from roasted bosc pear slices, savoury notes from the fried rosemary and gooey mozzarella cheese made the dehydrated duck forgivable....\""}
{"text":"I am already preparing myself to be pelted by tomatoes for this review. I swear, I am by no means a pizza snob, and I can get down with a Domino's pizza every so often. Maybe I came here with expectations that were too high - after one failed attempt to go to the University location, I've had Libretto on my list for the past year. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was fine, but it wasn't anything to rave about.

I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, which is hip, cool, casual, trendy, and kind of dimly lit... pretty typical for establishments in this area. My date and I were seated at the bar, which was fine, but meant that I didn't really get a good view of the back of the restaurant. I ordered a cocktail (Vanilla Fumo - ingredients: jack daniels, vanilla galliano, lemon, smoke, egg white) which was really interesting and had this lovely smoky undertone because they sprinkle some ashes from the oven on top of it. (As a side note, try not to actually ingest the ashes, because they are gritty and feel kind of unpleasant in your mouth.)

Pizzas: We ordered two for two people, no apps, which was a good portion. One was the duck confit pizza, and the other was the prosciutto pizza (without arugula) which we added anchovies to. Of the two, I liked the duck confit pizza better, because I liked the slight sweetness of the pear which I thought meshed well with the saltiness from the duck. The prosciutto pizza actually kind of disappointed me, because it was just average. I've had better prosciutto pizza at other places where I honestly just could not stop eating it. Perhaps the anchovies were also a bad call on our part because there ended up being too many salty flavours on our pizza. 

Anyway, I left kind of thinking... \"oh that was nice\" but not like \"OMG I'm obsessed with this place and need to come back every single day\" kind of thing. That being said, I absolutely would not be opposed to going back to any of their other locations to try other things, I just wasn't blown away by my first experience here. Despite the bar seating, servers were pretty attentive and nice and we weren't ignored."}
{"text":"In a pinch, this is a decent place for a decent pizza. I think part of the three star rating is due to the average service and the fact that we were looking for a place with coal fired pizza. Additionally, we have been quite spoiled by the likes of il Paesano, Marcellos and some of the Vaughan / Woodbridge establishments! 

We ordered the special of the day which was the spicy sausage pizza. Really good flavour however, we usually get our pizza well done in order to get a nice crispy base and not a soggy pizza, however this turned out to be quite droopy and the toppings all slid off. Saying that, we still did enjoy it as we were quite hungry.

:)"}
{"text":"My partner and I were on a double date last Tuesday evening for dinner. We would recommend making reservations because it gets quite busy and loud. The bar has limited seating (maybe 5 or 6 bar stools) making it difficult to order drinks if you are waiting for a table. The kitchen is open and looked pretty clean which is a big plus for me. Here is what we ordered:
~ Calamari - Quite tasty and very crispy however, the sauce was a little bland for our taste.
~ Meatballs - Juicy, well seasoned, and simply delicious. I drenched mine in the tomato sauce.
~ Flank Steak Spiedini - Definitely would order this again. The cubed beef was so tender and bursting with flavour.
~ Proscuitto and Arugula Pizza - We thoroughly enjoyed this pizza. It had a nice crust and there was a generous portion of proscuitto. 
~ House-Made Sausage Pizza - We did not enjoy this pizza because it was completely soggy from the caramelized onion. The only crispy part was the crust. As much as my partner loves onions, we will not be ordering this pizza again.
~ Tiramisu - Our server said the restaurant is known for their tiramisu. I thought it was okay. You can definitely taste the espresso but the lady fingers were soaked in the espresso for a tad bit too long.
~ Chocolate Amaretto Budino - This was recommended by our server. It was really delicious. The chocolate was nice and smooth and not overly sweet. We would order this again."}
{"text":"Pizza: Compared to the Ossington location, I found the pizzas a bit soggy in the middle, but otherwise, the quality is about the same. The cremini mushroom stood out in particular. However, the daily feature, Berkshire ham, was mediocre; the toppings just didn't really mesh together.

Beet Caprese Salad: The beets were nice and sweet. The cheese is supposed to be mild and delicate, but it was basically flavourless...

Black and White Quinoa Salad: Quinoa that actually tastes like something!

Panna cotta: The sauce is ultra-sweet, but the cream is really, really good: light, smooth, fresh, and very slightly tangy to offset the sweetness."}
{"text":"Great thin-crust pizzas.

Pizza: I had the prosciutto and the nduja, and the toppings were good, but it was really the tomato sauce and cheese that stood out to me. The tomato sauce was fresh and sweet, and the cheese was pleasantly chewy with actual mozzarella flavour.

Fried calamari: Excellent. Crunchy batter with chewy calamari.

Arugula salad: Good combination of flavours, though there was a bit too much vinaigrette. I really liked the Piave shavings.

Espresso-cinnamon gelato: Actually tastes like gingerbread to me.

This location doesn't take reservations, so it's best to show up early for dinner because the lineups are huge."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 930pm on a Saturday night for 5 guys. Side entrance off of King - great location. Spacious inside with modern decor. Below street level space. Waitresses were fast and the table was ready and held for us. They called my cell at 930 - I said we were 5 minutes late - no issue holding the table - but obviously a 6 top at this place is in high demand. Guy on the phone who took my reservation told me as much - he was polite and helpful. 

We had the steak spadieni to start - which were really flavourful - crispy bread mixed in with great beef. They brought us some bread with balsamic/oil as well which was solidly good. 

Beer selection on tap held 3 of my favourite beers:
Peroni, Ace Hill and Muskoka Detour. Solid!!!

We all got pizzas. Waitress recommended the Njuja sausage pizza - it was delicious. My buddy got the diavola - which was super spicy (as advertised) and satisfying. Love that hot salami heyohhh!

I've had libretto before and knew what to expect - great sauce, amazing crust, fresh ingredients and perfect cheese. Most of my buddies hadn't been - two are Italian - and they both left raving about the great pies. 

The surprise of the night was the beers on tap. It was nice to continue drinking great draught after we just came from Bar Hop down the street (which has a huge beer selection). 

We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Just like all the other reviews, it is the best pizza in Toronto. We had to leave Toronto to Niagara falls, and there's a long wait since it was the long weekend. So we ordered Togo, and we still enjoyed the pizza and carpaccio very much."}
{"text":"I heard about this place a lot so tonight I decided to give it a shot.  Ok you need to know that I'm Italian and I know very well how the real Italian pizza is made in the old country and how it should be.   Ok the pizza here is good. Very acceptable. Let's say that is very good but there is definitely margin to be even better. The one thing that I found is that it could use a few more seconds of oven time to make it just a tad crispier on the crust.  I had a classic Margherita and the  sauce was delicious as well as the Ontario buffalo mozzarella.   Other items I tried : the arancini antipasto that was scrumptious ... Mouth watering. Really that good !! The peas sauce mixes with a zest of lemon and some thin onion was simply perfect.   The rise was cooked well and the inside scamorsa was melt to perfection.   The beef carpaccio was ok. I personally did not like too much the type of marinade that was on top. But overall was ok.  As for the dessert I opted for the Bombolone a typical Italian fried dough nought. The dough was OMG just perfect. Rolled in the tasty sugar.. Mmmm just delicious. The sauce that was chosen was too bitter for this type of dessert. The end result was somewhat Ok. I would just get rid of the blackberry sauce and use traditional Italian crema (custard).  So at the end the trip was totally worth it.  And I cannot wait until I will come back the be next time to try more pizzas and some other choice of dessert.  Oh. I almost forgot. The espresso at the end of the meal was perfect. Not too long not too short. Just the way it should be.     Will go back for sure !"}
{"text":"Good pizza! Very tasty, but a little bit pricy. The arancini is spectacular! Pizza size is good but if you are not to hungry it is worth to share. They also have gluten free option and it was amazing! Really similar to a regular pizza dough."}
{"text":"I like this location a bit better than the one on Ossington. The service was fast and super friendly and helpful, and the food was great as always. The wait was not as long as at the other location and the vibe was much more casual and inviting. 

I have only visited this location once but I would go back again over the other spot anytime. 

I loved the gnocchi appetizer!"}
{"text":"Pizza choices aren't that great, I think toronto has choices that are much better. The sauce is also too salty. Service is quick. Ambience is alright but feels more like a lunch place - very bright. I prefer the Ossington location for ambience."}
{"text":"This place is still great. You can actually get a table these days. The food is delicious, the cost is reasonable, and the service is friendly and spot-on. Love the unlimited made in house carbonated water."}
{"text":"In my mind Libretto is a place for pizza, because hello its delicious there. But this past Saturday I was reminded its also a great place for a late afternoon snack and cocktail combo. 

My partner and I were on our way back home in the West End after an matinee theatre performance, getting hangry but also feeling in a celebratory mood. What I'm saying is, a bandaid solution of chips or chocolate was not going to cut it. It was a weird time for restaurants though - that limbo between 3:30 pm and 5 pm when a lot of places aren't open. But then I remembered that Libretto is always open in that weird window! And not just open, but still bustling enough to provide a bit of atmosphere. 

We decided on a set of matching cocktails called Up in the Air (bourbon, amaro, aperol, lemon) and two starters: 

1) Burrata with celery, canellini beans, pistachios, capers, chili, mint, lemon
2) Arancini with smoked scamorza, stracciatella,fresh pea puree, crema fresca, fennel, mint, parsley

We also opted for a small basket of bread with oil and vinegar. The rosemary bread here is a weakness of mine. 

It was everything I wanted. The burrata was fresh and buttery and its accompaniment was light and crisp but with some good protein from the beans. And you can't truly remedy hanger without fried rice and cheese balls, so the arancini was a forgone conclusion that lived up to its delicious destiny. 

Also just want to give a shout out to the service staff. They are always super attentive and without pestering. And our server on this occasion was, without any specifics to point to, just generally very sweet."}
{"text":"I had visited Libretto at their Ossington location a few years ago and really loved it. I came back this year to their University location. The pizza was good, but nothing spectacular. I was a little less impressed than what I remembered. But I couldn't tell if its because it wasn't as good as the Ossington location, or perhaps I had better pizza elsewhere since then -- thinking of Nolana in Montreal.

The dessert was pretty awesome though, a s'mores with a chocolate-cayenne base and a blackberry coulis. It was the highlight of the night.

The service was friendly and efficient, no complaint there.

I might try it again, but would perhaps go back to the Ossington location instead."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and our waitresses was above exceptional.

The restaurant is a tight fit between tables but it's cozy and comfortable. It can get loud but not to the point of you not being able to hear a conversation at the table. 

The wine selection is great and has a lot of local and Italian selections. 

Love the fact that they start off with some delicious fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette- always a plus in my books.

We had a table of four and shared the buttermilk calamari. I wasn't crazy about the red pepper almond sauce because I personally prefer white sauce with calamari. However, my friend was literally licking her fingers at how \"great\" the sauce was in her opinion- it's all about preference. The calamari was cooked and breaded to perfection.

We also shared a delicious thin crust pizza. Ours was the pizza special of the day which had sausage, spicy peppers , tomato sauce, cheese and basil. It was amazing and SPICY- which the waitresses warned us about...but we all love spicy food so it was not an issue.

Overall, great experience, delicious food and reasonable prices. Will be coming back for another Real Neapolitan Pizza :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! What more can I say... First time at this location and to me the food we ordered tasted the same as their sister locations.  Although I do feel the service could have been slightly better, hence the four star."}
{"text":"Great Pizza with a great vibe. Central location with lots to view from the patio. Ordered a few proprietary Stone fruit beer from I  believe Wellington County? Had the pear and duck, as well as the fungo pizzas. Awesome. Nice thin yet crispy crust. Used some nice fresh cracked pepper to compliment the ingredients. Nice nice for sharing with a friend. And more than enough for one person. I highly recommed this location . Authentic Napoli Pizza just like back home."}
{"text":"Same food at other locations. Good italian fare. Thin crust pizzas, apps and drinks. The customer service here is great though - very friendly and accommodating. Takeout orders usually ready in about 15 minutes. I like the arancini and the diavolo pizza quite a bit. Their specials are usually really good as well. If you want a casual King West spot, this is a great option."}
{"text":"We walked by this place to grab a quick bite. The service was very good from the start. The servers are knowledgeable about the food and let you know about the restaurant. This place makes Neapolitan pizza. They bake their pizzas for 90 seconds at 900 degrees so food comes out from the kitchen fairly quickly. I believe they have a feature pizza that changes everyday. 

We started with the prosciutto di parmi and had the feature pizza (it was like a meatlovers type of pizza on tomato base). The bread they served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was very good. The cheesy bread that came with the prosciutto was delicious! Their pizza was good but not the best. I had a lot of trouble eating it without making a mess. It was hard to cut into pieces and hard to hold with my hands because it's so thin."}
{"text":"My favourite Toronto pizza... Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula is especially tasty.
Arancini to start, tiramisu or affogato for finish and I'm a full and happy person."}
{"text":"Friday night, I was ready to order but heard the special and changed my mind for a pizza that was a riff on a croque monsieur: bechamel sauce, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese and proscuitto. Phenomenal! Also ate (or sampled) olive appetizer and an affogato, both very good. Plus a Aperol Spritz which was super tasty.

Service was great, nice atmosphere, tasty food.

My favourite pizza restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"Disappointing is the best way to describe the hype around this place. 

The Roasted Cremini pizza was laced with salt, probably from the cheese used. The espresso was a bit too hot. 

Two of us has the Cremini pizza separately and both felt it was very salty."}
{"text":"As an Italian from Woodbridge would put it: \"bro Libretto's pizza BRO!!! It's fricking delish bro. The pizza and calamari had me like like \"MINCHIAAA BROOO\"."}
{"text":"After reading all of the rave reviews in Toronto's local papers, I was expecting a lot more than I got after my first visit! As warned, the lineup was out the door and it took about 30 minutes to get a table for four people.

The menu was a lot smaller/more limited than I had anticipated but we each managed to find several items to choose from. The pizzas (I ordered a Margherita - which I believe is just basil/tomato/mozzarella) were great but not any better than what you'd get at Terroni or any Yorkville pizzeria.

What ultimately turned me off was our service. Our young and inexperienced server had an air of superiority and unprofessionalism about him unlike anything I've seen, especially at a new/bustling restaurant like this that probably makes many first impressions each night. 

He kept constantly trying to upsell us in a very obvious way, and when we declined his offers to order wine, sparkling water, appetizers and desserts, he rolled his eyes and briskly fluttered away to serve a more profitable table. With a different server I'm sure our enjoyment of the meal would have been much better!"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much we went twice while we were visiting Toronto. The pizza was amazing and the atmosphere on a Saturday night was very fun. The music was nice and we were dancing throughout dinner"}
{"text":"I love this place, the pizza is amazing and the service and atmosphere are sublime. It's one of my main go to places to visit with friends. My favourite salad is \"Rocco's Salad\" Never knew one could deep fry a soft boiled egg! 

The have recently changed their menu and in looking forward to going through and trying all the new items. I did have the kale salad. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"tldr: Not am authentic pizza joint. Bad quality ingredients and average execution.

The calamari is disgusting. The squid has a fake texture and tastes frozen. The pizza oozes chili oil. There is no generous portions of meat or other toppings. The crust is thin and average. There are so many other lower cost pizza options to try."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about Pizzeria Libretto that I'm surprised it took me so long to finally try it out. The restaurant is rather narrow but the d√©cor is bright and chic. True to what I heard, this place is extremely popular. We ended up waiting over an hour for a table for two and got seated at the bar.

While the complimentary bread didn't impress me, I very much enjoyed our antipasto del giorno, which was some sort of marinated eggplant on a piece of toast.

The Neapolitan potato croquettes were delicious, arriving piping hot. Can you really go wrong with a deep fried ball of potatoes? 

On the other hand, the buttermilk calamari wasn't impressive. The calamari itself was too tough and difficult to chew through, worsened by the fact that they were thick cut. However, the accompanying Romesco sauce was a refreshing departure from the usual mayo-based dips we get with fried calamari.

Onto the pizza. Both the Italian Sausage and Hot Peppers Pizza were delicious, with the thin crust perfectly charred. I personally prefer the Italian Sausage white pizza.

For dessert, we opted for tiramisu, which was more like a creamy pudding with mashed up pieces of cake stirred inside. I loved it!

All in all, a very good experience, and I'd love to go back to try other variations of pizza!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into the place, I liked the feel. Nice high ceilings. Funky lamps. Good vibe.

But I'm picky about my pizza. I like it simple. I like a THIN crust. And I like cooked ham and basil and cheese with chili flakes. I pretty much order the same thing everywhere I go. But Pizzeria Libretto doesn't offer cooked ham as an item. Really?? In any case, I wasn't impressed with the pizza.

The best pizza I've had outside of Italy is Bottega Pizzeria in Montreal. If their pizza is a 9/10, then Pizza Libretto's is 5.5/10. (6/10 being average.)

The Good
- nice, comfortable modern decor
- good service from our waitress

The Bad
- the pizza itself is below-average"}
{"text":"Watched Ugly Delicious ep 1 and came here to satisfy pizza cravings. Definitely one of the best in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Got the duck and it was great. Friendly staff, fast service.  The wine was a bit over priced for what they had. Try the lunch special,  it's a great deal!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We were on a roadtrip and wandered in here because it looked nice and is in a cool neighborhood. We sat at the bar and Chris was our server, he gave great explanations and recommendations on both the food and Canadian beers on tap which I had never had (Beaus & Duggans #9 + another I didn't try). 

I got the Sausage pizza - the sausage is apparently made in house and it is great...it's got a little sweetness to it. My wife got the margherita pizza which is always a good choice.

Since we were roadtrippin we asked where else we should go for brunch the next day as well as Montreal, our follow-on destination. Maja, the manager, came over too and gave us some great recommendations and we talked about the DC area, where we live.

Overall the food and service was top notch. They get extra props for making our roadtrip and experience in Canada top notch!!"}
{"text":"I loved the environment of this place and the food is delicious. I'm from out of town and pizza isn't a food that's hard to come by but this neopolitan style pizza hits the spot. 

I ordered the buttermilk fried calamari and the salami pizza? It's been a while since I've been back so they might have taken this pizza off the menu. Overall, love the chew and burnt edges on the pizza."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go here since it opened.   Finally went tonight.  Lets just say that it wasn't worth the wait.  I'm so disappointed in their pizza.  I had the house made sausage pizza.  It was soggy and sad.  Calamari was good...gnocchi fritters...a good take on tatter tots...I went for the pizza which ive read so much about. ..im not surprised that it's no longer rated highly in the best pizza in Toronto.   I'm glad I finally tried it so I know never to go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service come out of this little location. They were completely accommodating for a large group. 

Will go back and will tell my friends to check out their wood oven pizza."}
{"text":"We were huge fans of the Ossington location when we lived in Toronto, so we decided to check this location out while in town.  The food, cocktails, and service did not disappoint.   

We started with the beet caprese salad and arancini and both were good.  Actually, the arancini was fantastic.  Wish there would have been more.  Also, the olive oil they served with the bread was spicy and delicious.  I washed it all down with a Rosemary Fashioned, which good.

The House-made Sausage Pizza Bianco was just as good as I remember it being at the Ossington location.  I kinda regret not trying something new, but nostalgia won over.  

The service was excellent.  The timing between dishes was perfect and our waiter was great.  I'm terrible about remembering names.

The only negative I might have is the decor and set up at this location, though it totally fits with the area it's in.  I just prefer the cozy, ol' timey feel of the original."}
{"text":"Good pizza is hard to come by in this town and I am all about gourmet pizza. Pizzeria Libretto is heaven on Bourgeossington.

I've been twice and had a nicer experience the second time around. For starters, they used to squish all the tables together so you were really eating with everyone in the restaurant. This could be nice, unless you are seated next to total assholes and annoying couples. Anyway, they've changed that the next time I came, we had our own table (albeit really, really close to the others, so we still talked to everyone).

I think the food here is great. Great! I haven't seen any complaints on Yelp for the most part about the food. So far I've had the pear salad (yum) and the doppio margharita. Delicious. While there are a lot of meat options, vegetarians are welcome here. And the wine was great.

Really, I have no issues with this place. I can't even think of a quirky something to spice up this review. Pizzeria Libretto is a nice experience, if you have to wait, go to 58739456 bars in the area, and enjoy your meal.

Oh, but I can do without that guy who walks around with the eye. He looked a bit grumbly. I think he's the owner.

OK, seriously though, everything else is wonderful, but just be mindful that you are part of the gentrification of the area. Some food for thought."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Be prepared to wait or come early (i.e. 5pm). They don't take reservations. Best seat in the house in my opinion is at the far end of the bar. Pizza's are great. Super thin crust (as it should be), simple and fresh ingredients. Oven is imported from Italy - takes about 90 seconds to cook a pizza. Apps are great too - buffalo mozzarella is tops. Wine is VERY reasonably priced and they have a really good selection.

This place blows Terroni out of the water. And other bonus is they aren't pretentious servers like at Terroni."}
{"text":"I went to Libretto with a couple of friends as a recommendation for wood-fired pizza, which is not easy to find in Toronto. There was a 35-40min wait time but they text you 5min before your table is ready so in the meantime you can walk around Trinity Bellwoods which is a really nice area. 

The service is really good, made us feel like we had a dedicated waiter just for our table. Everytime we ordered something it came within a couple of minutes, including the food! Ok the food maybe 5 minutes.

The pizzas are delicious! \"Verace Pizza Napoletana\" We had the cremini mushrooms and the special of the day, nduja sausage. The dough is very soft, with the right amount of charred from the fire, you could taste the freshness in the sauce, the cheese and the mushrooms. The sausage had the perfect amount of heat. 

We ordered tiramisu and chocolate pudding as desserts,  they come in a cute little mason jar and they were amazing! Ended the evening with perfection.

Nothing bad to say about Libretto, outstanding ambiance, flavours, textures and temperatures, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at Pizza Libretto when dining with a friend on a Sunday evening. 

FOOD - Both our kale salad and pizza were outstanding and prepared with fresh ingredients. We found sharing a pizza and a salad between 2 of us to be \"just right\" in terms of portion/amount of food. 

SERVICE - Perhaps a bit slower than I would like, for food to arrive but overall very good. I do appreciate that the waiter took initiative to ask about any food allergies (I am severely allergic to nuts) from the beginning of our service. Our water was replenished quite quickly any time it was noticed we were running low. 

PRICE/VALUE - A pizza and large salad came to a total of just under $40 after tip, split between two of us. A fair value for the high quality of ingredients used. 

AMBIANCE - We chose to dine on the patio, which was nicely landscaped. Keep in mind this located is in the middle Financial District and surrounded by office towers, so the view isn't exactly breathtaking. 

In summary, Pizza Libretto offered a. great experience, one I would gladly enjoy again soon!"}
{"text":"We had the cremini mushroom pizza, ricotta gnocchi and the mascarpone panna cotta. The gnocchi was a small plate, so we had it as an appetiser and it was delicious. The dessert was the best part of the meal, we are definitely going back for that panna cotta very soon. the pizza was good but it wasn't great. We got a tomato sauce on the side as this pizza only came with white sauce and that definitely made it better. I didn't enjoy the wet centre of the pizza. I know that's their intent and its what makes it authentic but the centre became really soggy and the pizza was very salty."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Drinks were expensive. The service was very good and the food came extremely fast before we even got our drinks. The pizza was good, it would have been better if it was hot. Would probably go again but not get the same pizza, I wasn't a big fan of the prosciutto."}
{"text":"Oh HAY Pizza Libretto! Your staff is incredibly skilled (and good looking) and your pizza is the best in the city... how on earth have I not reviewed you until now?!

This place doesn't take reservations, so if you come in on Friday at 7 expect to give your name, and then head around the corner for a drink or two. Luckily, it's Dundas and Ossington so you have plenty of options. 

I like to start with the warm olives. Simple and delicious. My favorite pizza of theirs is the Cremini Mushroom with gorgonzola AND buffalo mozzarella. Though, sometimes I like to start with the arugula salad (it's really refreshing, and mixes sweet and savory very well) followed by a good old fashioned Margherita (I ask for extra mozz... though it probably doesn't need it.)

The prices are completely reasonable for authentic Neapolitan 'za. 

I'LL BE BACK FOR: They are now serving a small cocktail list, not just the usual wine and beer, and I'm looking forward to trying one soon!

PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD: Sometimes I eat my pizza from the inside out, and leave the crust. Thus my plate looks like a crust steering wheel at the end. This annoys my favorite busser. Vroom. 

STAR SIGHTING: Once we met Russell Oliver (yes... the cash man) at PL!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, this is the white anchovy with roasted garlic and mozzarella.....my friend ordered the margherita and man was that something special. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I arrived with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm. It's still crowded but the line up was short (we were the second couple on the line). We got seated on a table for 2 at the back within 15 minutes. 

So far... so good :)

We knew that we're going to try the Prix Fixe $15 lunch menu and we did. I ordered the arugula salad and he ordered the bruschetta with meat. The arugula salad was delicious and the portion was actually quite big. My boyfriend helped me finish my salad because I wanted to reserve enough space in my stomach for the pizza :) His bruschetta was ok. To me, it looked like a french baguette with hummus and 2 strips of deep-fried bacon. Or is that what bruschetta supposed to look like? Hmm... I'm not sure.

Here comes our pizza. We both ordered the Margherita and boy, they were huge (albeit thin). There was a generous amount of mozzarella (you can get extra for $2), but not the basil. I like basil so I needed more than just 5 leaves on my huge pizza. Nevertheless, it tasted divine. Fresh and yummy with just enough tomato sauce :) The boyfriend was happy with his as well.

For dessert, we each got a gelato, his was vanilla, mine was espresso affogato (spell check?) The vanilla was too sweet, but the espresso was delicious. We ended up sharing our dessert, so we're both happy with our choices.

Here comes our bill. Initially, we thought they're going to charge for the meat for his bruschetta (the waiter asked if my boyfriend would like the meat or vegetarian brusch). But no, it was an even $30 bill (before taxes and tip). For the quantity and quality of food you get, $30 is such a steal. I'm not a pizza fan, but I would come back to Libretto for their $15 lunch special :)"}
{"text":"Just finally tried this place out after hearing a lot of hype. Unfortunately it was a beautiful Saturday night in Toronto, which meant that any bar / restaurant along Ossington would be busy - which was annoying as they don't take reservations. Granted there were lots of options to have a pre-dinner drinks at while we waited for our table. Probably around 45 min for 2 people. They text you 10 minutes before you need to show up, which helps if you're at a bar around the corner. 
We got seated at the bar, but we had lots of room to eat and drink. Prices are not unreasonable based on the quality. I had a great pizza. Still think Terroni is my favourite, but the crust was amazing...and they actually cut your pizza for you."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick mid-day bite. Great service, love the atmosphere and charcuterie was just what was needed."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a Canadian friend and was so excited to try it. Unfortunately it was quite a let down. 

Though the service was really good, the food wasn't. 

I ordered the pizza special of the day which was pepperoni and homemade sausage with spicy peppers at a cost of $18. 

I asked for the peppers on the side after finding out they're just green chilies and asked to have onion added. 

After 15 minutes or so the pizza came out and looked delicious but I immediately noticed there was hardly any cheese on it. A few dollops of fresh mozzarella and that was it. 

Still, I was hungry and looking at the edges of the pizza it looked like it was going to be a nice, crisp crust until I tried picking the first piece up. It was an oily, doughy mess. 

I'm not sure how you get the edges of a pizza black but the middle nearly raw but that's how it was. 

I still devoured it like there was no tomorrow since I had an epic hunger but I would've much rather had a Fired Pie from back in the states at half the price."}
{"text":"Despite our late arrival 20 minutes before the restaurant closed, the staff was very kind, friendly and accommodating. The margherita pizza with extra cheese was delicious! It was so good that we ordered a second one after we finished the first."}
{"text":"Tried three different pizzas for lunch. All were amazing. If you're looking for great pizza, I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"3 stars partly because this place gets sooooo much hype and we waited an hour to get in, only to find that the pizza was just a bit more than avg. One pizza we ordered had arugula on it and it was closer to a salad than a pizza. It wasn't bad but wouldn't be the first place I would go back with so many amazing choices on ossington."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with a group of foodies. The pizza dough is really REALLY awesome. Soft and doughy but not thick and heavy... it was perfect!

We tried 5 pizza among the 6 of us and also had 3 appies (if Olives count!).

Margherita - good benchmark for neapolitan pizza -- 4 of 5 for simplicity..but 3 of 5 relative to the other pizzas
Cremini - very aromatic and cheesy - 4 of 5
Nduja sausage - 4 of 5! its like a spicier, meat version of the margh.
Duck confit - my fav!! 5 of 5
Berkshire ham - cool idea with a sunny side up egg - tasted like a breakfast pizza -  4 of 5 for uniqueness though I would not order this again if I was craving \"pizza\" pizza.

Calamari is overrated - i don't like fried cala tho so maybe that's just me.
Butternut squash rice balls - err... they are not so good. 

In general, all the toppings were all very fresh and generous! I also tried the fig gelato and the espresso-cinnamon gelato. Both were great! The fig was a bit richer and sweeter while the espresso was light and icy textured. 

I forgot what type of wine we had... but I really liked it. I think it was the Ripasso but it was Delicious!!

Definitely go there early because it can be a wait. We got there at 6:45pm on a Tuesday and stayed till 9:45pm. I think only 20min between 7-8 was there some empty tables."}
