{"text":"They have changed something since they opened Cheese, toppings etc.
Not as good.
Better places for Pizza downtown"}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time and the experience was excellent! Made-to-order fully customizable pizzas made with a great variety of fresh ingredients. We ate it there and were in and out within 20 minutes. Great customer service and all members of the staff were extremely friendly and happy to help out. A custom, 11 inch, 5 topping, plus \"finisher\" toppings was only $7.99 and it exceeded my expectations in taste! O, and they have beers on tap and by the can which is a definite bonus!"}
{"text":"The service here is great and the employees are friendly but not too talkative which is great. The pizza is delicious and they make it really fast. Also you get to watch the process which I thought was very cool."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner during the Grand Opening event with a friend. We waited in line for over an hour. The staff were friendly and the line moved efficiently.

I ordered a build-your-own pizza with ancient grain dough, red sauce, fresh mozzarella, my favorite toppings, basil, and balsamic glaze. I like the many different choices, and the ingredients all looked very fresh. There really isn't anything like pizza fresh from the oven! My only gripes about the food are that the baking times seem a little inconsistent--my friend's crust was heavenly while mine tasted a little too crispy and burnt--and there were a couple flies buzzing around. I understand that the windows and door were wide open, but it was still a little off-putting to see a fly landing on pizza dough.

There are a few tables inside and several counter seats. There are garage door windows along the storefront, Pitt-themed images, and a TV. A nice, casual atmosphere to hang out with some friends.

Overall, I had a good experience. The pizza was yummy, but it's a little pricey. This is the type of place I'd take my parents, but probably not one I'll frequent regularly. Nevertheless, it's a great addition to Oakland!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review based on my visit today. This time I took my pizza back to work (about a 4-5 min drive to eat it... so it may have cooled off in transit... but I feel that the pizza wasn't cooked long enough. The banana peppers weren't warm at all but were cool to the touch. I'd expect them to be at least warm after being cooked with fire. I ended up picking them all off on the slices I ate for lunch.I'll reheat the leftovers on my pizzazz and hopefully salvage them for dinner. I don't plan on returning - especially since I've had better fired pizza around Madison."}
{"text":"It's ok for what it is, a fast casual wood fire pizza place meant to serve a lot of people fast.  I can't say anything about how fast the service typically is because today they were severely understaffed and I think it was an exception to the rule.  The crust is tender and crunchy, but missing flavor.  Cheese is great, sauce is fine and toppings are average at best.   It's a pizza you can stop eating before it's gone.  If the pizza was someone you met last night, you would introduce him/her to your friends in the morning but wouldn't let them stay for lunch."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and, although there are a few kinks to work out, I hope it will be a regular part of my lunch rotation. 

The first time I ate here was an evening just a few days after they opened. I customized a bianco pizza and it was delicious--albeit a little light on toppings. The only problem was that the oven wasn't working properly and--the promise of having your pizza cooked in 150 seconds--took more than 15 minutes. Luckily, I wasn't in a hurry. Although, because of the oven issue, they did stop accepting orders and were turning people away at the door after I got my order.

I returned after the lunch rush a week or two later and speed wasn't an issue. However, the person making my same custom white pizza put entirely too much cheese and garlic on the pie. So much that it was incredibly greasy and the crust could not support the weight of the toppings--making it rather difficult to eat. No only that, but there were big clumps of garlic that crunched when biting into a slice. Yet another problem was that the outer edges of crust were burnt to a nearly ash-like consistency. So, needless to say, my second pizza wasn't nearly as good as the first.

I'm optimistic that the opening kinks will get worked out soon and am crossing my fingers that my third visit is a charm with just the right amount of toppings on a properly cooked crust. In the meantime, my opinion is that this place is worth trying. You may just want to have a plan B should the line be too long or the oven not working properly.

As for the price, if the quality issues get worked out, I think it's fairly reasonable. It would be nice though if you could add a small drink and walk out for under $10."}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic! Very fresh and European, flavorful with lots of options. We are lunch regulars.

The staff always seem angry but the service is very fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Tonight, I had a pizza with chicken. I informed an employee that my chicken was undercooked, as it was chewy, pink, and tasted disgusting. The employee stated that this was impossible, as they order all of their ingredients precooked. 1. That doesn't change the fact that my chicken was gross and 2. EW Lotsa uses precooked ingredients!!! They did not offer to remake my pizza or do anything about the fact that my pizza was nasty. I just had to pick off all the chicken. Very disappointed. My first two experiences at Lotsa were great, but this one defiitely encourages me to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lotsa Stone Fire Pizza was super tasty! I'm a huge pizza lover and it was pretty great. I really love the atmosphere and how it was decorated. I got a pepperoni pizza and the cheese stick and both were really good. I really like that the pizza crust wasn't burnt like some stone fire pizza places do. Literally perffffff"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this concept (build your own pizza fast food style) to make its way to Pittsburgh.  They offer white or wheat pizza dough (also gluten free for $2 extra) and about 5 sauces to pick from. I went with the white pizza dough with red sauce.  Next up you get your choice of  cheese plus 5 toppings including 1 protein. They have pepperoni, chicken, and Italian sausage plus more to pick from. I wanted to do veggie so loaded up on green peppers, pineapple, banana peppers, olives and onions.  I also went with the shredded mozzarella and the pizza was so cheesy! They are generous with the portions and the pizza bakes quickly.  Once the pizza is done you can get it to go or eat there (a nice amount of seating). Don't forget to get any sauces or extras like oregano, basil and many dressings. My pizza was complete with a side of ranch. This all took less than 10 minutes and the cost is $7.99 plus tax.  A great stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came for their grand opening where they served $3 pizza all day. I was pretty excited for this place because it was a new pizza place in the center of Oakland. So I came around 5:15pm and started my order around 6:30pm - approx 1hr15min wait. I expected the wait to be pretty long since it was the grand opening and $3 pizza so how can you not?? 

I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza but while I was in line after putting in my order, the workers were talking to me as if I was building my own pizza so I was confused... and I noticed that the cheddar jack wasn't put on my pizza when it's included on a BBQ chicken pizza... I'm not sure if it's because it was the grand opening and it was really busy so the workers were hectic getting in everyone's orders... but I was disappointed that they couldn't get the specialty pizza order right. It took about 2 minutes for the pizza to cook in the oven which was pretty impressive. 

I would say that for the size of the pizza, $8.99 is not worth it. Also, one of my friend's pizza wasn't even cut when she received it. Overall, it didn't seem like there was anything special really about the pizza here - just like any other build-your-own pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a Friday night at about 1:30am. Big mistake. Not the pizzerias fault, but definitely not the place to go if you are easily annoyed by drunk college students and workers who are tired.

The moment I walked in, the music almost blew my eardrums out. They play it so loud, it was so difficult to communicate with the employees. The pizza selection however is really nice. It highlights the most popular of pizza selections such as margarita, meat lovers, and classic cheese. Or you can build your own. I decided on one with mozzarella, pepperoni, green peppers and tomatoes. The cooking takes very little time and you can finish it with things like olive oil, arugula, basil and pesto. 

The taste of the pizza was really good, but honestly, nothing mind blowing or totally unique. It tasted a lot like Ians Pizza, which is their main competitor right now, if that gives you any idea on how it tastes. If you have been to Ians pizza before, you know that their slices are huge. If you are looking to get more bang for your buck, Lotsa is the way to go since a whole pizza is about two Ians slices for a little over $8. However, I cant eat a whole pizza by myself and I am usually alone when I go out, so I would still walk a little further down State St to get my favorite slice of Ians for $3 or $4 and save a couple bucks."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and attentive. Great concept. Personal pizzas choose or make your own on the spot. Cooked very quickly. Taste delicious!!!
Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time waiting for the chaos of the grand opening to die down. I tried the Bianca which was pretty good except for the fact that mine just had a lot of ricotta cheese that kept sliding off. This chain appears to seek out and flourish on college campuses. I thought it was really cool how they dedicated an entire wall to Pitt with photos of the Cathedral and panther. I do agree with other reviewers that $8.99 doesn't really seem worth it for the size of the pie. Nonetheless, seeing as though I live nearby, I'll definitely be back for a late night craving. Not many places are open as late (3 am) which is also a really nice perk of this place. You'd think there would be more late night bites in Oakland. Who knows? Maybe Lotsa will change the game."}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars 

Comparable to Blaze pizza if you've had that before? But I would have to say Blaze wins out. Best thing is how quickly you can get a pizza made! Worst thing was the price :(( Didn't feel like the size/quality was worth over 9 dollars. Would probably return if a friend wanted to try it out but not sure if I'll be returning on my own again. This is a college town, we're all broke so yes over 9 dollars for a small pizza is expensive to us. Nice service though!!"}
{"text":"I came for their grand opening, $3 build your own pizzas all day, hoping that Lotsa wasn't just a lotsa hype. The line was out the door and we waited a good hour until getting our food.

The ingredients seemed fresh and you can see them roll out the dough at the beginning of the line. I ordered my 11\" byo pizza: ancient grain crust, spicy red sauce, mozzarella, chicken, jalapeños, green pepper, red onion with ranch as the finisher. It was yummy, but the red sauce was lacking? All I could taste was the cheese and jalapeños and the ranch was light. However, the pizza is prepared and cooked very fast (5 minutes?), but I don't know if I could regularly pay $9 compared to getting pizza at porch or fuel and fuddle for a similar price."}
{"text":"Pizza and service are awesome. Slightly overpriced though. Soon they'll be doing unlimited toppings! The crust is crispy and thin-very good."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. Pizza is awesome. Size is a bit small, but it's perfect for single portions/splitting with someone else. They make the pizza fresh right in front of you starting from just a blob of dough. $9 to customize your own pizza. Amazing value and amazing taste.

Great with root beer. :)"}
{"text":"Terrible ingredient quality. Over cooked to the point it tasted bitter.  I would truly avoid."}
{"text":"I was walking down Forbes Ave headed towards a different restaurant but I was intrigued by the street-facing opened windows  (garage door-esque) and just had to go in. I like the variety--choose your own crust, sauce, cheese, toppings--while also providing the predesigned options. There also gluten-free crust. Basically same concept as V3 but I found this to be tastier and more filling. I got the BBQ chicken pizza and was told I could add additional toppings so I did! It was made quickly. I sat at the opened area that faces outside which was great in the nice weather. I just love the crispy crust!! It didn't *blow me away* but it's a great addition to a college town. Overall, I really enjoyed it..I probably won't do the BBQ again but will go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed yet. My mistake; went at 12:15 pm. The prices and menu items are on the wall when you get close to the register; however, the toppings are on a small menu leaflet. Pizza with up to 4 toppings-$8.99; a pizza with cheese and sauce-$5.29. Want 1 topping on that cheese pizza-now you're back up to $8.99. I order the cheese and sauce-stick with what I know first time out of the gate. It was finished quickly. 

However....whoever took it out of the oven mangled it (and apparently thought it was OK to give to a customer!!). The end line worker (very nice) looked at it and order another one. I looked over and noticed it was mine. Having limited time, I was really upset that this happened (I know; no one is perfect, but...) They made me another one. Yes, I was parked at a meter. I added more time to accommodate the additional wait time. I also had originally had red and spicy red sauce on the pizza. The one I got was only red. The same woman apologized. No manager. No credit to come back. Just more wait time and more money on my meter. 

I'll give them the growing pains clause and forgive. The pizza was good-not great. But, I'll try them one more time. As many know-if I love you, I tell lots of folks and I frequently return. If I don't like you I still tell lots of folks and then check you off my list!"}
{"text":"I am actually quite surprised this place only has three stars. First, you get a sizable pizza with FIVE toppings included, yes FIVE who honestly needs more than that to create a delicious combination. Second, the lines are long but the service is quite fast, about the pace of a Chipotle, if you will. Third, the pizza is delicious. Now some people are not a fan of a thinner crust but I honestly did not feel the crust was lacking. I can't speak to the taste of their signature pizzas but I built my own with Italian sausage, chicken, bacon, fresh mozzarella, and spinach  with basil and balsamic and my mind was blown. Now I will say the price point is just under $10 for a personal pizza which is not bad, but not great, but outside of that I have little to complain about. There is friendly service and ample seating to top off a solid taste experience. I definitely believe it is worth your time!"}
{"text":"Meh. Trying to be Blaze and failing. The crust isn't as good, the sauces taste weird, they want to skimp on toppings and sauces, and they still served pies to us after burning the crust. We will not be back any time soon, which is too bad, because they have a great space and location. I predict they are closed before summer 2018."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Oakland in a while and didn't realize so many new restaurants were opened.  Stopped in to try some pizza and I'm glad I did. Had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was outstanding. The personal size was enough to eat and have leftovers for my midnight snack. Fresh ingredients, clean restaurant, fair prices, friendly staff and good food. I wish they had more beverage selections like slushies instead of only having fountain drinks but it was a rough day so I think vodka was my beverage of choice at the time. I will go back and try other menu items like the salads and building my own pizza when I'm in the area. Parking is a bit of a challenge but I recommend garage parking to ease the pain. This was a nice discovery. I think it's a great concept and recommend them for lunch."}
{"text":"I was the third person in line and ended up waiting 20 minutes to have my order taken. I ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza without bacon. After ordering, I waited an additional 20 minutes only to find they put bacon on my pizza. In the end, it took more over 45 minutes to receive a pizza and they had run out of green pepper and ranch dressing at 6 pm. To be missing ingredients around dinner time and waiting over 45 minutes for a pizza was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Stopped by Lotsa, which is a new pizza place on State Street. They have a stylish, modern and clean dining room with three big TVs, and lots of tables. I was skeptical that they could produce a pizza in 5 minutes, but my meat lovers pizza was ready really quickly. 

The staff consists of mostly high school aged kids. They were nice and seemed to be working hard, but when I ordered my beer, they poured it and let it sit behind the counter for a while... nothing like room temperature Miller Lite! 

But nevertheless the pizza was quite good. It had the char marks from the oven, but the crust wasn't super thin. It was filling and the ingredients tasted fresh. The price is also fair, and the cost of beers is very cheap. The size of the pizzas is 11\", which is too much for one person and too little for two, so decide beforehand if you want leftovers. Nevertheless, Lotsa is a good addition to the State Street scene."}
{"text":"Easily one of the top 5 pizzas I've ever had. The margherita pizza was delicious! The clerk recommended pesto and boy was he right. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place.. right on Forbes Ave with cool garage doors facing the street.. it is a VERY clean pizza joint with employees wearing gloves which I love.. the pizza is very tasty I get the cheese with spicy red sauce.. def worth a try.. also tons of free after toppings like oregano, Parmesan etc"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is terrible. 

They try to skimp you on toppings, so I constantly had to ask to add more. Their space is huge so you'd expect them to be prepared for a large volume of people, but that's not the case. If you're willing to wait 20+ minutes for the staff to slowly roll out dough and slap some toppings on, this is the place for you. The staff doesn't have good manners, ignores customers to had side conversations, and consistently drops swear words. 

Such a bummer considering the food is good but the process to get it makes it not worth it."}
{"text":"Came in with the grand opening crowd, who stood in a line that stretched a good distance down the block an hour from closing time (past the Chipotle). It moved pretty fast though, about a 20 minute wait, so that is probably a good sign for how this place is meant to be fast casual / takeout. The BYO fast-fired pizza type of pipeline seems to be pretty popular nowadays, and the way that Lotsa does is similar to other places--you pick a dough base, sauce, a number of toppings, and then they fire it up for you, ready to be eaten in about a minute or two. There are also suggested combinations, though the BYO is probably what most people will end up doing. 

I am tempted to compare this place relative to Blaze Pizza, since that is the chain that I've frequented most and really enjoy. In that sense, Lotsa is more expensive and also more frugal on the toppings. While Blaze gives you unlimited toppings, Lotsa limits you to five and charges you for anything after that. One good thing is that Lotsa has some interesting choices not really found anywhere else, like anchovies. As mentioned though, I would hope that they are more generous with them; my pizza ended up with a rather large and dry crust portion that was devoid of both sauce and toppings, which wasn't entirely pleasant to eat. If I were paying regular price, I'd expect a better tasting pizza. 

That said, I'm sure they'll work out some of these kinks after opening day, so I look forward to coming in to try their pizzas again ."}
{"text":"I was eager for this pizza place to open up as it didn't look like the typical Oakland food.  Taste-wise, the pizza was great.  I got a Hawaiian pizza which was about par with most Hawaiian pizzas I've had.  However, the staff making the pizza were so quiet, and would not speak up even after asking.  The process of 'build your own pizza' was not well-defined and only made it more difficult that you could not hear the staff.  The woman at the cashier hardly spoke.  She didn't reply to most questions and acknowledged in grunts.

The atmosphere was well decorated.  The line moved pretty quickly.  However, it was about 90 degrees and muggy that day, and the restaurant had the front garage door windows open to the outside.  The air must not have been on as well, so it felt about 90 degrees inside and muggy.  The pizza oven added to the heat as well.  All the staff were visibly sweating on their foreheads which made you wonder if their hands were clean if they were wiping brows.  It was too unbearably hot inside, so I chose to eat somewhere else.

I would gladly go back if the staff attitudes changed and they did something about the temperature.  However, the pizza is priced moderately high, so will not go often if at all."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I came during Oakland Restaurant Week. 

It was crowded, as I expected, for lunch. It's on a college campus so I would advise to keep that in mind if you want to avoid lines or order ahead.

I got the margarita pizza. It was the special that day. The crust was crispy. The pizza was preset but I did finish with balsamic glaze. It was tasty. The flavors were as expected. 

I have some other places that were a similar concept and honestly preferred them. Here, you can't get unlimited toppings and their finishes are limited. The other places are also less expensive. 

For a lunch with coworkers, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Tl;dr - would come again only if I didn't know what else to eat. 

The good: pizza tasted pretty good, got the BBQ chicken and old bay shrimp. People who worked there are very friendly and nice. Love the atmosphere, clean environment. Bathroom also very clean. 

The bad: slow lines, people didn't know what to do when the pizzas came out of the oven. Person who cut the pizza was handling it without gloves so hard to know if he had clean hands. Red sauce was way too salty to the point we couldn't taste the tomato in it. Michael Jackson also a bit loud and made conversation and ordering difficult but I'm sure some people would see that as a good...

."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Lotsa Stone Fired Pizza. I was most impressed with the flavor of the crust-- it was delicious. The sauce could have used a little more salt, but that was my only complaint. Love that they have fresh mozzarella as well! 

This will definitely be added to my Oakland rotation! 

Street parking available, but can be hard to find. 

Service was solid, as everyone was very kind."}
{"text":"The Bianca pizza is amazing, it's a must try. Also the toppings they have are very fresh and yummy. The staff is very friendly and quick. They have pictures of Uw Madison athletics, which give a fun and homey feel. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Build your own pizza and helpful staff can't wait to go back again. Spotted Cow only $3 wow!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very, very good but I would only suggest going there if you're willing to wait 30 minutes and want to listen to rap music so loud that you can't hear your friends talking across the table. (some people walked in and walked right back out because of the profanity and volume of the music)

The staff seemed EXTREMELY untrained, and had no idea how to work behind the counter. I ordered a small, pepperoni pizza, and small salad. The pizza making went fine, and my pizza went into the oven. However, when it came time to make my salad, I waited for 16 minutes. The workers had no idea how to build my salad (even though I ordered one off of their menu.. a garden salad?!) My pizza had come out of the oven, and my friend had already sat down with her pizza. 

Also, my friend charged her meal on her Red Card, and it seemed none of the employees knew how to work with that. They made her scan her phone 3 times, before finally letting her go. Then, after ringing me up, a more experienced worker came and ended up charging my order to her Red Card. My order was more expensive, and when she asked if she could get her money back, the person working the register said \"it wasn't worth it for 2 dollars because she'd have to come tomorrow and talk to the manager\" I thought that was very poor customer service. 

Very good food, but very poorly trained staff."}
{"text":"I came to Lotsa on a Friday evening for dinner with one of my friends. I love woodfire pizza, so I was really looking forward to it!

When we arrived at 7:00, there was a line. It wasn't overwhelming, so we decided to wait. We waited in line for 20 minutes before reaching the counter, and I ordered a Margherita pizza. My pizza did not come out of the oven until 20 minutes after I had placed my order. After my pizza was pulled out of the oven, it sat on the counter for 5ish minutes. After seeing 2-3 people who came in after me get their pizzas before I got my pizza, I decided to say something. They also didn't have any basil, which is something I wish they would have told me when I ordered a Margherita pizza. By the time I sat down at the table to eat my pizza, it was 7:47.

The pizza was really good, but the service was horrible. I don't know if I will return."}
{"text":"Manager Sheila Byrne sent me two coupons after I gave Lotsa only one star. I used one yesterday, ordered differently, and liked my meal very much. This time I had mozzarella all over the pizza instead of little dabs in the Margherita, as well as cherry tomatoes, basil, and sausage. I can now say I recommend Lotsa. And I can imagine eating there after I use my second coupon. It seems like a better deal than Piada across the street. 

Thanks, Sheila.

My only suggestion is that you start carrying San Pellegrino. Plain for me, flavored for other customers."}
{"text":"The chipotle of pizzas!!! What do I mean by this? You hop in line, design your pizza, and BAM a few minutes later you got a pie sitting in front of you. Personally I think it's fantastic. 

I ordered the hawaiian pizza and got the spicy tomato sauce in lieu of the regular one. Yum! I loved the bit of heat from that. Also opted for some additional fresh mozzarella along with the shredded cheese. I want to come back and have some more of their special pizzas that looked intriguing in flavor. 

The space is large, this pizza is cheap. For what you get it is an amazing deal. I even had enough to take some home. I think this a great choice for a quick meal if you are on state street."}
{"text":"I was looking for something to eat this afternoon before a flight and after walking up and down State street, I finally decided to give this place a shot. 

The place is pretty big and has plenty of tables. It was empty when I came in so there was no wait and I got my pizza pretty quickly. I ordered the margherita pizza on ancient grain crust. 

I am from the NY/NJ area so this pizza was a bit underwhelming compared to what I'm used to, but it wasn't bad. Not amazing, but not bad. It got the job done. The crust was nice and crunchy but not burnt, and I liked that it was made to order and fresh out of the oven. 

If you're in the area and in the mood for pizza I'd say try it out, but don't expect anything out of this world."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places. I had the option to build my own pizza and I took full advantage. I ate there 4 different times and each time was great! They're open late so if you ever want pizza I recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"This is some of the blandest pizza I've ever had. 

The Bianca wasn't too bad, on account of all the cheese. Don't bother with the margherita."}
{"text":"Gross pizza, pretty over priced, mine was burnt and the person serving me was pretty rude"}
{"text":"Very similar to Blaze or Mod or Pieology depending on where you come from.  It's make-your-own and ready in minutes.  ( you can also make a salad). It's a decent, quick lunch or late snack and large enough to split a pizza, so well priced.
We experienced great customer service as well."}
{"text":"I went here because they had $6 for restaurant week for their signature pizzas (Hawaiian, veggie, meat lovers) instead of the usual $8.99. I got the veggie pizza and wasn't particularly impressed. As far as pizza goes, it was great, with a thin crust and gooey cheese. However, I think that the pizza is only worth it's original price if you customize the pizza, as the baseline pizzas aren't too exciting. It's pretty busy during lunch, so it is somewhat difficult to find seating, but the service is great and efficient despite the traffic."}
{"text":"I am soooo disappointed in this place. I really wanted to like it and was expecting it to be good since it has great reviews. The food was okay, not awesome but not great. The service was what really killed it, and also the lack of cleanliness. 

I got a build your own pizza and the problems started there. The guy stretching the balls of dough into crusts was leaving obvious tears in them which I thought was bizarre. Then when I was getting the ingredients on my pizza, another worker stuck his hands in all the different bins, which was pretty gross and contaminated everything with other ingredients. It would be much more sanitary to just have spoons or tongs or something for each bin. Then at the end of the process, the final worker asked if I wanted any finishers so I asked for ranch to which he rolled his eyes, huffed and exclaimed \"the ranch is all the way downstairs.\" Excuse me?? I have never had that kind of laziness displayed in a restaurant and I was taken aback. He didn't go to get it and instead just handed me my pizza (tried to hand it to me through the glass, lol). He also complained to me for about thirty seconds about how he had to be there for the next six hours and how tired he was. Boo hoo, if you hate it so much don't work there. 

I was going to give this place 2 stars because the food wasn't terrible, but then when I was leaving and throwing my stuff away I found a banana pepper under the paper from the pizza. I didn't even order banana peppers so it just shows the lack of cleanliness of the place, obviously the dishes hadn't been washed properly (if at all). Bottom line, this place didn't train their employees properly or just didn't interview well as they are almost all extremely incompetent. Save your money, go to Ian's or literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm not really a pizza person, but this place cooks it right in front of you and you can see the stone fire grill. I ordered Margherita pizza and I have to say everything was perfect. The crust holds up in the middle (not too soggy or anything) and at the ends, all the ingredients are super fresh, and you don't have to wait very long. The only drawback is that the pizza size maxes out at 11\". Still a pretty good deal for around $8."}
{"text":"Pizza 4/5
Service 4/5
Timeliness 5/5
Price 2/5

I only came here for the grand opening because of the $3 build-your-own pizzas, but the normal price is $8.99 (over $9 including tax). I personally don't think the size of the pizza is worth that much money. There are $2 off late nights but even still over $7 is a little much :/

Because of the price I won't come here again anytime soon, which is why I'll rate this place a 3, but the pizza did taste pretty good :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza place in a super convenient location! It's basically the same thing as Blaze if you know what that is, and if not, it's Chipotle for pizza. 

The price is fair for the size - don't expect to be too full but it's not a small amount by any means. I believe it's $7.99 for an 11\" pizza with 5 toppings not including sauce/cheese. The staff seems to be very friendly (they actually seem a little overstaffed from what I saw...) and the service was really fast!

The food itself was pretty good - not as good as a \"real\" pizza place if you get what I mean, but it's not too shabby! The place is pretty clean as it just had its grand opening, and the ambience is pretty nice. I'd recommend checking this place out if you'd like a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I saw stone fired pizza and thought it might be good. I walked in and had my doubts, and was not disappointed.  Not one star, but  Can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"Ick! The TL;DR of this review is simple: Go to MOD Pizza in Fitchburg if you're looking to build your own 'za. 

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza. They use a buffalo sauce on this pizza that tastes neither buffalo-flavored nor delicious. 'Chemical-y' is how I'd describe it. The pizzas are overcooked so parts of the crust come out burnt. The chicken on the pizza had two sketchy, fatty pieces. Think about that--on a 10\" personal pizzza at least two 'Oh my god, what IS that?!' pieces of chicken. I picked the rest off. One of them looked really dark and sketchy beyond the two I'd already eaten. 

The bathrooms are locked because it's State Street. I thought that was excessive but twice while we were eating people came in to ask to just use the bathroom. It's spacious enough inside with a cool, huge dining room-like table to eat at in the middle of the room. But what's cool decorations when the food isn't enjoyable?"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the lunch special pizza. They had the Bianca on sale for $5.99 and I had to try it. Neither of us was very hungry, so we got a pie to share. It was perfect. We each had 3 pieces and left full. There wasn't a line when we walked in, so we ordered and got our food super fast. The 700+ degree oven made the crust crispy and browned the cheese and toppings perfectly for us. It had just the right amount of ingredients so the pizza and crust wasn't soggy. I like when a slice retains its firmness and doesn't droop while you are eating it. The crust was chewy either. For $5.99, the Bianca was so worth it! They have other pies on special throughout the week. I'll need to stop back in on another day to check out some of the other varieties. There was a little line when we were leaving, but it looked as though the staff was moving through the orders with ease. I like that they have some vibrant Madison based wall coverings. There was lots of seating for both large and small groups. They have to go boxes available for those looking to take a pie to go or have leftovers."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I just went here again expecting awesome service like the first time and I was disappointed. From start to finish with absolutely zero line, it took longer than 15 minutes. The making process was inefficient and the staff was frazzled with missing ingredients even saying \"I wouldn't eat that crust if I were you\" which prompted me to change my crust type. I love the pizza but didn't like the experience. 

First time here was a success! My fiancé and I were able to split the 11 inch pizza in half so he could get his own side with personalized toppings and so could I! It was quick and the staff was friendly. I suggest doing a create your own. Also, gluten free crust is only 2$ extra and they DELIVER FOR FREE!"}
{"text":"The customization level is great here- you can get basically any toppings and the pizza is ~fresh~ out of the oven, which I appreciate. 
The service is pretty subpar though, it seems to be mostly college students so my pizza was a bit sloppy (might have been because one new employee or something), and she didn't add basil to my margherita pizza so it ended up being all cheese and a few tomatoes... I wanted pesto as a topping and there seemed to be miscommunication about who was going to help me as well. The employee also didn't ask what I wanted while I was making my way down the ingredients - I would add way more toppings next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the large Greek salad with a hardboiled egg. Everything was fresh and tasty. The menu said they had cranberries for salads but they don't serve that anymore so not sure why they don't just cross it off the board. My friend had a white pizza, so bland and boring! I understand the concept of made to order food but the service its just too slow for the venue. Would rather sit in a restaurant for the time spent waiting"}
{"text":"My 5 star review is based on taste. I really enjoyed my pizza! I had the \"Bianca\" with pepperoni and it was delicious. 

I notice comments talking about customer service which I don't really understand. We went on one of the busiest nights downtown Madison, which was the July Madison Market. While most people were eating from the vendors, we decided to try Lotsa Pizza! The staff was friendly and they were patient with me after I switched my order several times. Like my check-in said, I can tell the staff was new but they were trying! 

The portions are big, I ate half my pizza and took the rest for lunch. I plan on returning."}
{"text":"I like this place but I want to love it. However, I can't. The staff are super friendly people and always good for a laugh. Which is good because you can stand in line for a very long time. I appreciate that they put the effort into making a pizza. However, the oven may be too small for large crowds because the guys were cranking out the pizza maybe too soon to try to accommodate. My veggie pizza was doughy in the middle and my green peppers didn't seem cooked at all. But I had been drinking so I just wanted food. I love that they give you free sauce options to drizzle on. Their ranch is amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick pizza.  Built my own.  The traditional crust was good, thin and crisp with probably a tad to much corn meal on it.  Had the spicy red sauce which is spicy and very tasty, really enjoyed the sauce.  The topping were OK.  Finished with a balsamic glaze.  Enjoyed my pizza and for $9 a pretty decent meal.  Interesting to see the pizza's in the oven on a turntable.  There are some tables and window counter but ordered take out since in a hurry."}
{"text":"What a disgrace. This is the worst build-your-own pizza joint I have ever visited. First of all, the toppings here are not unlimited, unlike at Blaze or Pieology, so cost-wise, it makes no sense to come here. 

In terms of the quality of the food, they use way too much cornmeal, so the pizza crust has a jarring texture. To add, the workers flatten the pizza dough by hand, which does not work when the pizzas are fast-casual because the dough cannot cook evenly in their oven. There were parts of the pizza that were undercooked and doughy that still imparted an unpleasant and rugged texture to the tongue due to the excessive coating of cornmeal.

The topping options here are limited in terms of available offerings as well as cost. They did not appear to be that fresh anyway.

Lotsa is in a prime location in Oakland and while the space is nice (I like the big garage-style windows), yet food is terrible enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"The new place on Forbes in Oakland. It is a fast casual restaurant geared towards college kids. Their concept is build your own pizza, but they have some pre made options as well. All of us ended up going with the build your own style. I got the classic pizza dough, buffalo sauce, mozzarella, blue cheese, spinach, red onion, olives,bell pepper, and a ranch drizzle. 

The pizza was made pretty quickly. I am a fan of their dough, which is nice and light. I was disappointed that their buffalo sauce was very mild. I was expecting more of a kick. The toppings are pretty standard. For $8.99, it is a decent sized pizza. Overall, not a bad place if you want to build your own pizza. The pizza itself though is very mediocre and honestly nothing special."}
{"text":"Not bad for a late night snack, very similar to Chicago's Blaze Pizza.  A lot of options, the only thing they need to do is clean out the oven a bit because our entire bottom of the pizza and sides were filled with past old burnt ashes."}
{"text":"Ordered via GrubHub. 

They didn't add all of the toppings that I asked for, and they didn't cut the pizza at all."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! If you've ever experienced not liking one or two ingredients on a particular pizza and wanted to substitute them to your favorites, this is the right place for you ;)
I made a build-your-own pizza. You can choose your crust, cheese, sauce and (lots of) toppings. 
They have a lot of options for each, but unfortunately it might go pricy if you add too much \"extras\". Other than that, it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza experience. Fast and very friendly staff. Bianca was awesome. Staff suggested to add spinach which I ended up loving. It will be my new favorite"}
{"text":"I've been to Lotsa twice now, and both times have had similar experiences.  Overall, I would guess the issue lies with poorly trained/unmotivated staff.  Today I just wanted the cobb salad, which the guy wrote down on the order slip. Then he proceeded to ask me what I wanted on my salad.  I replied with whatever is supposed to be on it.  It's a signature salad on their menu.  He kind of just looks at me, then at another employee, like he doesn't know what's going on.  The other employee pointed at the menu board and read off the ingredients.  He got to the avocado and it was out, so he had to go back and find them. The other employee finished making my salad and cut the avocado. The salad isn't awesome, and definitely wouldn't spend $10 on it again.  The pizza I got on my first visit was decent.  I would suggest going to Ian's instead, it's cheaper and fresh.  The employees know what their doing there."}
{"text":"Would prefer a jacks frozen pizza. Apparently it's not a good place to go in completely sober as it felt like we were in an upside down world. I felt like most of the staff was too cool or too high to help us efficiently. I didn't have high standards going in but I didn't think frozen would be a better option."}
{"text":"Went in at 7:30 on Sunday night, there were 2 people in front of me. 3 staff on which is more than enough to get the job done. It took 40 minutes to get 1 pizza, if I had known it was going to take this long I would've ordered pizza for delivery. Very upset, staff not efficient or apologetic. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went with my son for lunch today again--not sure why we've come back more than twice. Somehow, everything is bland. Texture of the crust is good, but I honestly couldn't taste anything beyond cheese--and bacon and onion were two of my ingredients. This is also the second time I've had to tell the person making my pizza to spread the ingredients more to the edge of the pizza--train your people, Lotsa!  For fast-fired pizza, Blaze in Monroeville does a really tasty job--excellent crust and ingredients--but, they're in Monroeville."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the authentic and simple taste of a good, stone fired, margherita pizza with basil and fresh mozzarella, and Lotsa definitely lived up to my expectations there. In addition to the basic margherita, they offer a variety of other pizzas on their menu, as well as a build-your-own option that includes up to 5 toppings. Overall, they have pretty good customer service; the staff is very conversational and they make your pizzas in just a few minutes. My only complaint is that being a person with food allergies, there is a lot of cross-contamination among toppings because they put the toppings on by hand (as opposed to with a spoon or other utensil) and they don't change their gloves in between touching different ingredients. Other than that, I give them a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Grand Opening! The line was crazy long, we waited for probably at least an hour and a half. The special was $3.99 for a \"BYO\" - Build Your Own Pizza. It's a personal pizza with your choice of sauce, cheese, up to 5 toppings (after which are extra), and then a few choices to top your pizza with.

It was pretty good. I got a BBQ sauce pizza with chicken, bacon, red onions, pineapple, and spinach, with BBQ sauce on top. For $3.99; I thought this deal was totally worth it and a total steal. I throughly enjoyed this Grand Opening Event. However, I don't think I'd be willing to spend $8.99 on the same pizza. I understand that they use fresh ingredients and everything is prepared and made right in front of you, so that's more costly. Of course. But on a college student budget, I could use that and get a large carry out pizza from a different chain that will feed me for multiple meals.

Delicious and fresh pizza; but a little too costly for me."}
{"text":"8.99 for a build your own pizza with 5 toppings (You pay more for extra toppings). It was pretty good and came out within 5-10 minutes of ordering. I wish they added more meat on my pizza though. 

It's in a convenient location if you find yourself in Oakland. The place has a cute design. When I was there, the windows were open so I sat facing the street, which gave a nice atmosphere to eat."}
