{"text":"Amazing Pizza for a Great Price! Plus I would recommend trying the steak hoagie Awesome!! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place looks so cute from the outside and the people seem nice. The pizza however is pretty bad. Maybe it was an off day? Will try once more. Seriously looked and tasted like the box kits you'd make at home as a kid. Zero flavor."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city and the guy who makes them, homemade, is very friendly.  I highly recommend trying them out!  Great pizza for a great price."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the city. I drive 20 minutes to get it with zero hesitation. Soups are great too."}
{"text":"Well crafted pizza with spiced sauce, oaty crust and plentiful portions of cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"This is the third pizza shop we've tried in pgh and it's by far our favorite. Super sweet courtesy staff, public television on at just the right volume, and super fresh ingredients. Great job!"}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of a mom and pop's corner pizzeria. There is only one table with four chairs (it's designed to be a takeout shop - not quite a dine in), you can see the entire kitchen, and they sell some convenience items such as milk, eggs, and cereal.

I decided to order two of the $1.50 slices which were advertised in front of the shop. I would describe these slices as eighths of a circular sicilian pie. Thie slices were reheated and not as fresh as I had hoped. If you come here, then I highly recommend ordering something that is made on to order such as a whole pie or a hoagie.

The prices seemed reasonable though I wasn't exactly sure of the portions. I small pie is $5.99, a medium pie is $7.99, and a large pie is $9.99 though I have no clue what the diameter of any of those pies are. There are also about a dozen hoagies on the menu (including a gyro) for about $6. They also have burgers for $2.49!"}
{"text":"Having lived next to Alex's pizza for the past two years, I can confidently claim that he has the best and most reasonably priced pizza in Bloomfield, yes even better than Caliente. Alex is also the nicest guy you've ever met."}
{"text":"Stopped by at lunch on a recommendation.  Was told it is good thinner crust pizza.  When I walked in a large thicker crust square pizza was coming out of the oven.  Upon ordering, Alex said I'll just give you this since it just come out of the oven, so you don't have to wait.   The crust was thicker with a nice chewy taste.  The sauce had some Italian spices.   A good pizza.  Not sure if they make thinner crust of not but the pictures on the hand out menu had pictures of both a round and square pizza.

The menu has hummus with pita bread, hoagies, burgers, gyros, and salads."}
{"text":"The steak hoagie was great, as was the meatball. Got the meatball hoagie with no sauce as per Alex's suggestion and it was absolutely delicious. The pizza was great too. Also Alex. Alex is great. 10/10 will be back"}
{"text":"Just around the corner from my apartment and I love it. Alex's reminds me of the Mom and Pop shops from back in the day as a kid. The pizza is so good and it's made with love. Whenever we go to pick up the food, Alex will come round from the kitchen with the pizza and open it up with pride to show you his work of art. Always wanting to make sure you're satisfied before you take it home. The gyros are equally delicious. If you've not been here you're missing out."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place is reviewed 4 stars. The pizza was like cardboard. I ordered mushrooms on top and it was raw, she sprinkled it with some cheese and toasted this. The pizza was a big slice, but terrible. such awful food. I think I'm sick eating this pizza. raw mushrooms with quasi melted cheese. gross ."}
{"text":"Alex's is by FAR the best pizza place in Bloomfield. Has awesome thin crust and thick crust pizzas. His sizes are awesome, too. The large is bigger than the extra larges you get at places on Liberty. He's also not massively overpriced like they are. (I suppose that's the trade-off to having your shop on a busier street. Higher? rent that you've gotta pass along to the customers.

It's hard to say which is better, the food or Alex himself. The shop is run by Alex himself and his wife. So it's literally mom and pop. They're both very nice people and Alex has a great sense of humor. Come in a couple of times and he'll know you by name and how you like your food. He remembers if you like your pizza a little extra crispy or whether you like onions on your hoagie, etc.

He also carries some grocery essentials for the people in the neighborhood such as milk, eggs, butter, etc. Sometimes he has home made cookies which are ridiculously good. There is honestly nothing on the menu that isn't delicious. He talked me into trying the falafel and hummus on pita bread and I was blown away that I've never had it before.

You can't say enough good things about Alex's. Great food by a great guy!"}
