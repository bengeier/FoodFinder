{"text":"I think this place gets the nod because there isn't a whole lot of Italian on that side of town with a family vibe. I compare this place to an Olive Garden without the American\"ized\" twist. Happy hour is decent and the sauces for everything are high quality. The shrimp parm is something that I haven't seen very often and it is phenomenal. I also really liked the eggplant ans shrimp appetizer. This is like a once a month place."}
{"text":"I held a friend's baby shower here.  The little side room was perfect for this event.  The room was ready before we were due to be there.  The staff was attentive and friendly. They accommodated for my party wonderfully.  The manager even allowed us to have the happy hour pricing extended.  I'm very very happy with the food and service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wow the food and service was terrible tonight. I am so mad because last time I was there it was the best experience ever. It felt like a completely different restaurant..."}
{"text":"My parents took my sister and I to this location since we were kids. I always loved it and then we started to go to the location at Arrowhead. The Arrowhead location was good up until about a year ago. Then their food's quality changed and I started sending food back too often. Last night (04/07/2014), I took my boyfriend to this location. It was his first time eating at Cucina Tagliani at any location and my first time back to this location in years. One of the best meals we've had in a while. I ordered the black mussel pasta for the first time and I can't remember a time where I had more flavorful mussels. I went to work after dinner and told everyone how good they were. My boyfriend was a huge fan of the garlic bread and the chicken parmigan. I'm thrilled to see a place from my childhood continue to offer the best quality and service. I forgot how much I love the decor there as well. I think we may ditch Olive Garden for a while and come eat here instead :)"}
{"text":"Patio weather is here. A great glass of pinot, an accoustic guitarist. Great atmosphere, killer food. I would highly recommend. Anne Marie took care of us, she was super nice. Started with the portabello mushroom cooked in a house vingerette and topped with gorgonzola cheese. A nice dressing of onions and sliced tomatos with 4 toast slices. (It was a huge shroom). I had the make your own pasta. I chose gnocchi with pesto sauce, added sliced portabello mushrooms and spicy sausage link. Boyfriend had the Papas combo - spinach cheese cantaloni, lasagna, and veal parm. This place has HUGE Portions.  (I apologize for the typos, am on cell doing this review)"}
{"text":"college graduation celebration for my son was a great success. this place rocks!Service by Thomas  was a+++, very attentive and caring. Our party room provided by Ronda for 20+ people HAD GREAT ambience. Food and drinks was awesome. can't complain about the price either. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"First timers here. Wife had the soup n salad,said both were up to par. I had the spicy parmesan sandwich which was excellent. We checked in with Yelp for a free wings/rings appetizer that was also tasty. Our waiter Eric delivered 5 star service."}
{"text":"If you want to spend $17 on a glass of Chianti which I am not even sure was the Ruffino because it should have tasted like a $17 glass of chianti, then by all means...  They said it was a 10 ounce poor and therefore double the price of the 5 ounce poor at $8.50.  I was very disappointed.  The manager Angela could care less.  On a high note, Shawn the waiter was wonderful and the lasagna and shrimp scampi were good.  Bread was stale...  I left feeling unappreciated as a customer and there are much better places to go for the money..."}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker, I am extremely picky about my Italian food, so much so that I'd rather make my own at home or hold out for my next trip back to NY.    I reluctantly decided to try Cucina Tagliani after reading so many positive reviews. Boy, am I glad I let go of my NY snobbery for one evening!   We ordered the caprese salad as an app (don't bother with the small, you'll want more) and veal parm & mama's favorite for dinner. Ah-mazing!!!!!   All of the portions are generous, but mama's favorite is ginormous, enough for 2 or even 3.   Overall, nice decor, friendly staff, family friendly and great food! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"great, had build your own ravioli with shrimp and scallops with lemon caper sauce!  also had wings and rings. this time i added sauted veggies"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmm, ravioli wth pesto , bacon and shrimp with antipasta on side.  here for friends bday greT time"}
{"text":"This is a very nice Italian restaurant that's perfect for lunch or dinner with your family. It's nice inside and the service is top notch.  I've only eaten here a few times but was always greeted by a friendly person who chatted a bit on the way to the table.  The servers are also friendly and attentive.   We got a sampler platter for a starter the last time we came and it was a lot of food!  It comes with artichoke dip, chicken wings, onion rings, mozzarella, zucchini and mushroom fritti. No problem serving three adults and two kids.  They have a nice menu with a number of choices. But, I figure that any place that has the tag line, \"your neighborhood pasta place\" is giving me a hint about what to order. I've had the Baked Ziti and the Sausage Lasagna. Both dishes are very good.  Their sauce is delicious and they're a contender for the best meatballs in the valley.  Nice place for a good meal with your family - note, they have a very good children's menu."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable experience for the whole family.  Food was excellent,  waitress top-notch, and the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly.  Try the angel hair with lemon and caper sauce!"}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I eat here we have a great time. It happened again last night. Our server Claudia was amazing. Friendly and quick to take care of us.   I usually have shrimp scampi and love it, this time I had Mediterranean chopped salad and my wife had clam chowder both were perfectly prepared, delicious and satisfying.   Thanks again Tagliani!"}
{"text":"The good was amazing ! We sat on the patio and listened to the live music. Very accommodating to our large party. I got the wedge blue cheese salad and it was amazing ! I also got the angel hair pasta and toma-fredo sauce and it was amazing !! I would recommend this place for sure !!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years. Unfortunately, today's experience was indicative of the slow slide down we've been witnessing. It started with us making reservations for a large party. Instead us, and/or the other large party, who was seated at the same time, being seated in one of the many side rooms, we were all crammed into the main dining area. Perhaps there is a good reason for jamming everyone in one room, but it certainly does not make for a good customer experience. The staff was as friendly as ever, but the food has declined. The steak in my Steak Gorgonzola was extremely overdone, and my wife's Baked Spaghetti was just \"ok,\" whereas in the past it has been \"excellent.\" The three stars I'm giving is for the friendliness of the wait staff, the delicious garlic bread and my personal nostalgia, more than for the food or overall experience. I'm sure we'll still eat here on occasion, but in a city full of options it will no longer be at the top of the list. Give it a try if you're in the neighborhood, maybe it'll be a good day and you'll get a taste of the old Cucina."}
{"text":"We went in today for an early dinner around 5pm.  We we're seated instantly. After sitting for about 15 mins without anyone  acknowledging us in any way, shape, or form, we got up and left. The manager had even been wiping and setting tables next to us and didn't acknowledge us. The two waitresses in our dining room, which only had 5 tables seated including us, walked passed us at least 3 times with drinks in hand for other tables. As we were walking out, the manager had the nerve to say \"Thank you!\" As if she hadn't seated us, and ignored us 15 mins earlier. We ended up at Ah-so on 75thave instead and the night was perfect there, where we gladly probably spent 3X what we would have at this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Walking in the place looked really nice had a high expectation. Receiving bread in the beginning was nice but the bread was rock hard. Literally cut my mouth trying to eat it. Once receiving our food, my spaghetti tasted like ragu, I could have made this at home. My boyfriends pizza looked like sauce with a lot of burnt pieces. With having such a high expectation from the interior and exterior of this place the food doesn't do justice. They need better quality. Our server was awesome though, drinks always filled excellent service."}
{"text":"So my husband and I decided we wanted Italian food for dinner one night, but he didn't want to go to olive garden. So he looked places up and found this one. Why couldn't this one have taken over the Italian food market like Olive Garden? First of all we both love their food. But they serve you massive amounts so you also have your lunch at least for the next day. The prices aren't bad at all either. Only down fall... it didn't move to PA with us..."}
{"text":"Food always tastes better with really good service. We had a great experience with Robin at Cucina Tagliani. She had made great suggestions, and we left satisfied, satiated, and happy.  We'll certainly return again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places. For lunch i love the calimari fruiti salad. Yum yum  For dinner there are a few od my faves. Chicken dynamite(spicy) and really good.  Seafood pasta always a winner if you like seafood. The salmon is also a winner.   Never had a bad meal here. They have another location at arrowhood but I like this one the best"}
{"text":"Took a chance at the average rating because the pictures looked delicious. Very glad we did. Greeted with a smile and seated promptly and served with complimentary garlic bread to die for. I would come just for the bread. We had two entrees off the 7 for $7 as well as a made to order large pizza plus the yelp check in free appetizer. All this food was more than enough for 3 people and 10 month baby with leftovers for dinner. Add in two drinks and our total was at $35 which is extremely reasonable.   The medium wings were the perfect blend of crisp, sauce and spice. Onion rings on the other hand were soft and lacked any personality.   Pizza was dressed with spinach, pep and ground sausage with motz and feta cheese. A+ except for the moist soggy center. Crust was thin with the perfect amount of crisp once you got past the soggy center, which was actually very tasty in its own right.   Baked spag squash was a first for me and I'm so glad I did. Who could deny the healthy flavors of a perfectly baked entree splashed with heavenly marinara sauce. The sauce brings the dish together giving it the perfect blend of flavors.  The chicken alfredo, sadly, was was the least desirable dish and will not be ordered again. My wife's ultimate fav dish wherever we go so we have high expectations for it and it did not deliver. Sauce lacked flavor and was a bit runny. Anything more to say? The noodles were cooked well and our 10 month old loved them, without the sauce of course.   Bathroom was clean!!   Liked the experience so much it prompted me to write my first review.  A very pleasant dining experience and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Tagliani's is my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley.  I love the eggplant parm and the artichoke dip appetizer is delicious.  The best part of dinner is the chocolate marscapone cake.  I have always received great service and I look forward to returning.  I always bring my out of town visitors here."}
{"text":"I have been here before with my bf and we had a great time with good food...we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner (well, lunch actually). We got drinks (waited 10+ mins) so I'll knock a star off and they were not very good to boot. We ordered the make your own pasta dish. My boyfriend ordered a spicy rigatoni with meatballs. I got ravioli with marinara. Within two bites my boyfriend could tell that there were nuts in it. He has a pretty bad nut allergy so I quickly waved someone down and I believe she was a manager...she had an accent but never said her name. She told my boyfriend it was HIS fault. His pasta dish that shouldn't have contained any nuts (no warning on the items he chose) somehow had nuts. She said he should have informed the staff before ordering but really! Pasta doesn't usually have nuts! I'm allergic to bananas but I don't go around telling places to keep my spaghetti away from the banana foster, do I? Honestly, she was so rude. I love the goat cheese salad but after that experience we won't be going back. The male manager ended up not charging us for the pasta."}
{"text":"We just went to the Italian restaurant tagliani at 59th and bell and was surprised that they now have a breakfast buffet it was fabulous we will go back again and again the food was amazing! The breakfast lasagna was was wonderfully delicious!"}
{"text":"We go to \"Tag\" every week! The food, staff and service are the best around..so friendly!  We love happy hour! I love the ministroni soup and chicken piccatta with angel hair! My huspand orders the individual pizza and wings, a great deal at happy hour!Daryl our server sees us coming in and brings our drink without us even having to order.Juan the busser is the hardest friendliest working guy ever! Can't say enough about this neiborhood Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I would just like to start off by saying that I have gone to this place for over 15 years and loved it, but after our last experience it will be our last. Our service was beyond horrible waited 15 minutes to get a drink order started, when we ordered our food it took almost an hour to get it. I had my 2 children with me who are 5 and 1 by the time the food came they were half asleep and starving asked for some bread to hold them over never got it and also never got a water that I asked for. Our waitress spent the entire evening talking to one table that you could see they were friends she kept bringing them free drinks and dessert, but ignored every other table she had on the patio. We weren't the only table that noticed the table next to us interrupted her conversation with her friends to get their check. Once we got our food my meatballs were burnt and couldn't even be eaten, my husband order the specialty Pasta Tagliani which has chicken on it there was 3 tiny strips. We would have asked for something else, but our waitress was no where to be found.  Horrible food for the price and horrible service will never be returning again."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new and thought we would give this place a shot.  Unfortunately it was a hot mess.   There is no authenticity here except for the environment.   The food tasted and looked like it was prepared in a microwave.   Completely lacked flavor and appeal.   We will not return at anytime."}
{"text":"Had to write about the great experience we had last night.  If you're  desiring some \" real\" Italian food,  look no further.  Everything was so fresh and delicious ans the service is top notch.  We had Keni.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and so sweet and professional!  We will definitely be asking for her on our next visit!"}
{"text":"My Family loves this place!! I have tried a few things now on several visits, and everything that I have had been 3.5 to 4 stars. The service is great and the staff is friendly. Happy hour is good if going for drinks and the desserts are yummy too! The portions are very big so get the half if your not a big eater. The ambience is relaxing and the diners are always laughing. The overal exerience is 5 stars."}
{"text":"We held our wedding luncheon here and it was perfect! Alice and the staff were wonderful and made sure everything was taken care of. Very friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend holding an event or special occasion here."}
{"text":"It's a good neighborhood Italian. Not gourmet but it's a good combination of value and quality. Generally we like to cook our own sauce at home. But when we're pretty much being lazy, it's a good enough getaway. You just need to order the half portions and that's plenty. The wine selection could be a little more extensive, but it does ok. I just get a kick at the total spectrum of excellent to poor reviews. Different strokes..."}
{"text":"The free appetizer you get upon check-in has surprisingly good wings. Had papas plate and baked spaghetti. Everything was very good besides the lasagna. Lasagna was a bit of a let down. But really enjoyed the manicotti on papas plate was great. Prices are decent. Service was good."}
{"text":"OMG. Since they changed management, this place went way down hill. I can't believe this woman actually argues with the customers! My gnocci was cold and she told me I could either pay half of it and get a free dessert or just take it off the bill. No offer to re do it, no offer to just take it off and dessert. We had a few more instances where there was a problem with our food. ANd she was just a nightmare. They need to replace this witch. We have been going here for years and I will vow to never go back to this location but instead head over to the Arrowhead location where the service is much better."}
{"text":"5 or 6 years ago, this place was awesome. Then they slowly kept going downhill. They changed some of their suppliers (the bread for instance was some of the best I have had, now it's low end). They removed some of their homemade meats (the salami was great) and they messed with their portions. So now I don't even bother going there. It's not that it is bad, it is still a decent place, it's that I remember how good it used to be."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday for Friday dinner, table for two.  Ordered happy-hour glass of wine.  Ingored us for awhile. They served my wife's soda, said wine would be up shortly.  10 minutes later, asked where's my wine, they said bartender was a little \"backed up.\"  15 minutes later, after appetizers and salad and ordering entrees, still no wine. Asked again.  Glass of wine shows up, filled maybe 1/3 full, if that.  Another 15 minutes , asked if dinner was coming soon.  Second basket of bread given.  Bread really dry that night.  Another 10 minutes without anyone stopping by our table, we got up to leave.  Waitress came by and said, please don't leave - your dinner is \"up.\"  Sat back down and she served our entrees.    Overall not a good experience.  Salad and bread -- the basics -- tasted like they were several days old.  Entrees, ravioli and fettucini, pretty good.  Service terrible.   But the manager came by, apologized and gave us our dinner on the house.  I appreciated his sincerity and that he didn't start spewing mumbo-jumbo excuses.  Just apologized sincerely and said he wanted us back.  We'll give it another try in a few weeks, see if the service is better."}
{"text":"We had horrible service! I couldn't believe how rude our waitor was when my friend asked a question about the butter, garlic sauce. The reply we got was \"it's butter & garlic\" wow, they pay you to say that??!! When I ask for suggestions & ask what a sauce tastes like & what the base is I want a server that's going to be happy to tell me about the menu & the food. The chicken parm was ok but not very flavorful & I didn't  like the garlic cheese bread. Overall didn't like it & will not come back. Olive Garden & Bucca de Beppo are much better & have way friendlier servers!"}
{"text":"Service was great however the food was not great.  I had a Caesar salad it was pre made in the frig so the temperature was good however the dressing was too garlicky.  I hade make your own pasta dish I had cheese Ravioli with pesto sauce and artichokes and sundries tomatoes.  The artichokes were chewy like they had leaves still on them.  The pesto was dry and I could not identify the sun dried tomatoes.  I probably won't try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The only thing that wasn't horrible was the service. My family and I went here for the first time and will definitely never go back. Originally, we came because of the chowder and by the time we sat down they said they were out. They serve clam chowder one day and didn't make enough to last the whole day. We got some bread and it was tough and cold so we asked for another one and NOPE that's just the way it is. So we got my daughter spaghetti and we got an appetizer of calamari. Calamari was SO BLAND that I had to put salt so it had something to it. We also got soup and salad for both of us. We got Italian dressing and baked potato soup. The Italian dressing didn't look good when it hit our table, it tasted so bad we took one bite and when she handed us the soups we gave her the salads back. The soup had such a powerful bacon taste and it was very clumpy. Seemed like it was just out of the can. We paid and left. I felt bad because the server knew something was wrong and it wasn't her, their food is just awful. I wish we didn't have this experience but we did."}
{"text":"We moved to Phoenix from a town in Ohio with a large population of Italians in 1993. I am also Italian. We have been coming to Cucina since it opened. We absolutely love the food here! You simply can't go wrong when you order from the Pick a Pasta. Over the last 19 years we have tried so many different dishes and they have all been delicious. We bring any family that visits us in Phoenix to Cucina and every single one of them has enjoyed their dinners. Some even ask to return there on subsequent visits. My 91 year old Italian dad loves the gnocchi. Out of town family have loved the tomato fredo sauce, gnocchi, saltimbocca, meatballs, both breads, the list goes on. The wait staff aims to please and will have the pasta cooked more soft if al dente isn't your style.My only negative comment is that the portions have seemed to get smaller in 2012. We used to be able to get the smaller size portion and have leftovers. Now, if we want leftovers, we have to order the large size. It doesn't make sense to me as pasta noodles are quite inexpensive. I still consider this the best home style Italian restaurant in the entire metro Phoenix area. In fact, I don't even care for Italian unless its traditional."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and was pleasantly surprised.  We were greeted and seated immediately, even though we were early for our reservation. I also downloaded the Yelp app to my phone and it offered a free appetizer at check-in.   Wings and Onion Rings combo.  Yum!  Enough to satisfy 2 adults and 2 kids.   I got the Spaghetti with Marinara and added chicken which was grilled.  Very delicious.  Husband got Baked Ziti.  Tasted great as well.  Son ordered the kids pepperoni pizza.  It was big enough to share with his younger brother.    I was very satisfied with the portion sizes.  It wasn't too much or too little.  We had just enough room for the Spumookie, which was a cookie with ice cream on top.  That I would give 4 stars to only because I recently had the Pizookie at Oreganos and that was just a little bit better.  Still, overall our bill was about $35 and for the around of food, and the quality, was great value.  It's rare to get that for a family of four.    Our waitress was new, but she was nice,  smiled a lot, helpful with the menu (I am one of those who asks a million questions), and more importantly never let our drinks run out.  As soon as it hit 1/4 full, we got a refill.   That's very rare nowadays!     Alice was attentive, friendly, and that experience (along with food) will make sure we definitely come back very soon.    We went to the 83rd and Bell location."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm with David M. et al - this place is extremely good in so many ways, I can't understand all the hate. I do not think the food rates a five - definitely a solid four, but I'm giving it a five for the overall experience and to counter the negatives which I think are definitely not appropriate.  Cucina Tagliani is in a strip mall. Then again, it's in Glendale, which might as well be Phoenix, so what ISN'T in a strip mall? Its decor is on the edge of being cheesy, but it was done well enough that you get what they were shooting for (Italian villa) without it actually being distracting. Except that it is, a little bit. If I have one complaint about the place it's that the seating at the tables can make you feel a tad self conscious, being so close to other diners and in the middle of everything. That said, it's obvious that they gave some thought to staggering the tables, and overall I didn't feel THAT uncomfortable, so make of it what you will.  The food is simply delicious, and the portions are beyond generous. It's difficult to screw up artichoke dip, but CT's artichoke dip appetizer was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Not good for me - because it was so huge it could have been a meal in and of itself. The bread - crusted with parmesan - was a bit too tough for my companion, but I found it a delightful accompaniment to the dip, and in any case, soft pita was provided as well.  I do not have enough good words for the optional antipasto salad ($1.99). There are two types of antipasto: the a la carte meat and cheese tray provided with a salad as an afterthought, and the full-on salad that is completely incorporated with meats and cheeses. The second kind is incredibly easy to get wrong. The antipasto at Cucina Tagliani is definitely of the latter type, and yet it is pulled off magnificently. I don't think I can recall having better. As others have mentioned, the canteloupe is a surprisingly delicious nuance.  My companion's garden salad was competent and delicious.  I opted for the spicy sausage and rigatoni, and she had the veal parmesan. Neither of us could get halfway through our \"half\" lunch portions, but we both agreed that they were superior examples of local Italian fare. Olive Garden this ain't. Not that I really have anything against Olive Garden - they do a decent job of wrapping Italian cuisine up for mass appeal - but comparisons to Cucina Tagliani are unfair - this is nothing like that. It is not bland, the portions are not so tightly controlled, and more than anything - these taste like someone's unique recipes - not recipes manufactured for mass consumption.  Finally, the price. Definitely in line with expectations. We got out with a generous appetizer, two salads, two entrees and two drinks - with enough to take home for dinner, and it cost us $36. The service merited a  20% tip, as it was efficient and very friendly. We never once wanted for something to nosh after the first initial 3 minutes.  Give it a shot. I doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! When our friends come to town we always bring them here. Our favorite is chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"Awesome spicy sausage penne!!! I! Great wine select! Staff was very friendly and easy going. We had a large group still had great service!"}
{"text":"On August 24, 2012, I dined at this restaurant and did not have a good experience.  I posted the review on Yelp.  I just want everyone to know that the owner himself, Kelly Sample cared enough to personally contact me and make things right. We love this restaurant and have returned and everything that night was the usual - great food, good service, huge portions and reasonable prices.  Thank you Kelly!  My one complaint about the 83 Avenue location was the fact that there was no patio. I just read today they are constructing a patio!  What else?  It's going to be dog friendly! Kelly and Kristy Sample ----- you guys rock!  Alice L."}
{"text":"Tagliani is our \"stand-by\" ... we visit at least once a month and have dined here many times over the past 8 years.  The Caesar salad is dressed with a fairly true Caesar dressing, without a lot of vinegar. As always, was good.    Rieseling wine same as always.  But I asked young man/server if they stocked my \"NEW FAVE\" wine:  ROSCATO, a sweet red from Italy...he said no.  I said well tell the owner it has just been requested.  (He chuckled annoyingly, as if to say \"yeah right!\" so I then told him...THAT IS HOW the industry improves...by listening to the customers who pay the rent!) He was younger, a new server whom we had never met...  Salmon was a fresher taste last night than usual.  This establishment manages to broil it and still keep it moist, yet fully cooked inside...a very good reflection on the chef! Ravioli was over-cooked last night, sadly.  Too soft, yet normally just right level of al dente. So, 2 things:  Bring in ROSCATO red sweet wine. It is wonderful!   Also, your Salmon has not been as fresh-tasting in the past year or so...as it was very fresh for the past 8 years.  have you changed vendors? Example:  Macaroni Grill (a chain) and Christos in central phoenix, both consistently serve salmon that is NOT fishy!  It can be done, with the right sea food vendor and buying / storage habits!)  This will remain one of our regular destinations.  But the stoic-faced ownership NEEDS TO LISTEN!"}
{"text":"Always good food and good service when I'm come here. The portion are big and served hot.  My favorite is the sausage lasagna but I've never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"One of the few non chain restaurants you can eat at on bell road! It's very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is not as good as it used to be. Not to mention, their prices have increased and their portions have decreased. Service is poor and the cleanliness of the place is questionable... I miss the way it used to be. I will not go out of my way to come here anymore. :("}
{"text":"Besides having the best happy hour, this place allows dogs on the patio. Best Mykonos pizza and calamari. If you ever need a delicious cake order the 1/4 sheet to feed twelve or the half for 24 ppl. You will not be disappointed!! My family loved this cake!!!!"}
{"text":"let's start with the service which was actually pretty good, Jada was on the ball and checked back often and was attentive, My issue was with the food.  Bland at best, overcooked, Fettucine Alfredo tasted like Paste and Chicken Parm was hard as a rock.  Prices were reasonable, portions were way too big.  I would much rather they buy better ingredients and cut down on the portions than serve this really poor food.  I prefer to go to local restaurants rather than the big chains, but when corners are cut like this, you can see why the chains are crowded and Tagliani was not"}
{"text":"Looked through previous reviews and thought we would try this restaurant out last night. I had the Spinach Riccotta Manicotti.  I was very disappointed. I love Italian food, but this was not anywhere near the quality I have had in the past. Would not return, as I said before very disappointing."}
{"text":"A non-chain (Italian) restaurant in Glendale/Peoria. The calamari appetizer was very tasty, we got Mediterranean which has a buttery dipping sauce and feta cheese. Otherwise, I thought the food was good and the prices were right. The wine list is not long (and they seem to have every level of Chianti Ruffino), but if what you want is a reasonably priced dinner with reasonably priced drinkable wine, this is a good choice. And it's not a chain.   (I have to agree with all the previous reviews as well.)"}
{"text":"We love this place!! went for the first time last weekend. The food was wonderful, reasonably priced and the waitress Barbara was the best. We ordered Mama's favorites thinking it would be a sample size of 3 different entre's It was 3 full servings. Wow, lots of food. We brought most home and had it for lunch the next day. We will be going again, even though it's far from us in Anthem."}
{"text":"We've been going to CT's for a while now.  You can't go wrong with their antipasta salad.  Never would I have thought that capicola and canteloupe would be good together.  Boy was I wrong.  Macaroni and chucks of mozzarella.  I crave it.  Their bread is amazing.  Their tiramisu is amazing.  Their service is amazing.  AMAZING."}
{"text":"Food was great and our server, Laurie, was efficient and polite! First time here, we will be coming back! Although next time we will probably get the half portion...."}
{"text":"In the area for spring training..came here for happy hour and it was excellent! Food was awesome and good selection of wine"}
{"text":"I came on a Monday... They were out of veal and steak. My dish was the spicy sausage rigatoni which good, not great. My wife had the shrimp pasta Alfredo... Disappointing! Sauce was plain. Turns out the sauce is already shipped here and they don't add any more spices to it. The shrimp tasted like the store bagged ones. Their bread was delicious. The mozzarella fritti was less than ok.  Staff was welcoming. The reason i gave it a 2 was because my dish was OK but my wife's dish was just not good. The Kraft's macaroni n cheese taste a lot better. Also, they were out of two main meats. Will not come back, unless i don't find a better Italian food. Im from Santa Barbara and have travelled all over the world and the states... By the way, my daughter ordered a pizza, which she says she enjoyed."}
{"text":"It was a busy Tuesday night when we arrived not quite 10 minuteslate for our reservation.  Our table had been given away but they seated us w/in 5 minutes or so.  Service was slow and our very nice waitress was bussi ng her own tables.  The food and portions were very good.  They don't have gluten free pasta but they do have substitutions like roasted vegetables or spinach. We all enjoyed our food but it got to be a long night, especially for our 3 kids.  Our waitress gave us $5 off our bill citing the slow service, which we had not even commented about!  I guess the kids body language was enough but I thought that was worthy of going back again as the food, especially the sauces were very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is calm and beautifully decorated. The food is delicious and you get a lot of it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time there. The food was so-so. Had the mussels appetizer and a third were empty. The waitress was inattentive and picked up the menu before we could order dinner. Didn't even tell us the kitchen was closing when we asked to order. I ordered an antipasto salad that had very little meats and included macaroni. He had the angel hair that was dry. I could never recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came here because there was a long wait at Cheesecake Factory.  I don't like to write bad reviews, but this time I have to.  Being from Chicago, we dine on a lot on Italian food.  This place is just BAD!!  The only thing that I can say that I enjoyed was the garlic bread and wedge salad.    The Calamari was breaded in Panko and the oil that it was fried in tasted old.  I ordered the Chicken Piccata.  The fettucini noodles were not freshly made, which I can understand being busy, but they tasted like they have been sitting around in the refrigerator and reheated.  The noodles tasted weird.  The chicken tasted poached and the sauce was just lemon juice sprinkled over the noodles and overkill on the basil.  Horrible!!  The aunt ordered the Shrimp Diabla and returned it.  It was BAD!!  I normally like ma and pa restaurants, but this place makes some of the worst Italian food that I have ever had.  Don't Go.  Find a different place to spend your money!!  Never again!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING service, location and restaurant. Friendly staff.  Great food.  Easy on the wallet!"}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise.  Normally, I pass on any restaurant that has a rating lower than 4 stars.  Food was good and more than plentiful.  Service was excellent and we will surely be back."}
{"text":"The appetizers and the staff were probably the only good part about this place.   The wife and I went for the first time.. and the last.   Their signature \"Pasta Tagliani\" was incredibly bland and waaaaay overcooked on the chicken.   Being someone that cooks Italian food and has a love for the culture that comes with it, I can tell you now that Olive Garden is 1000x better.. and that's americanized!"}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant at 1pm Sunday 10/27/13. The parking lot was pretty empty and from what I could see there was probably 5 tables occupied. We were greeted promptly by the hostess and taken to our seats immediately. That was the only good part of this visit.  We then opened our dirty menus and my children stated that the restaurant has an odor. I agreed it was a musty smell. We were beginning to be alarmed.  We then sat for owner 15 minutes and watched several  staff members walk by us. I was now losing my patience the restaurant was practically empty. A waitress then stopped at the table behind us and asked them was everything ok with their meal and began to walk pass out table. I attempted to get her attention but failed. About 3 minutes later she was back at the behind us by now we are gathering our things to leave because obviously we wore our invisible suits to dinner.  As my husband is standing she walks over like we were bothering here and states # what do you want to drink?\"  I am livid by now and state absolutely nothing we are leaving to which she shrugs her shoulders and says ok and walks away. As we are leaving the hostess ask if we were leaving my husband responds yes and she ask why he tells her and she apologized and stated she would go get the server if I wanted to which I raised an eyebrow. She then pointed out the manager and I realized he was the guy that had been leaning on the counter in the window the whole time. So he had a perfect view of us and never acknowledged that we were there so I declined. I will never step into their establishment again and from what I saw many others have made the same choice.. It was a ghost town."}
{"text":"We decided to give this restaurant location a try, We'd been to their Bell Rd location and were not impressed by their service. As a matter of fact, we've never been back and we live very close. So we tried this location with trepidation and am I glad we did. Food was good, service was excellent. The bread they start you out with is great!! We all had Choose your own pasta/sauce etc and 3 of 4 were excellent. ! of us had chicken on her sauce and it was not good tasting, but we were in a hurry and didn't make it known to the server. 3 of us would go back as the Rustic Roma sauce was very good."}
{"text":"First time here and I will go back! The food was awesome and the service was quick/friendly. The fried calamari was not lacking, the pieces were nice and big. I had the spinach manicotti (yum!) and my boyfriend got mama's dinner (alfredo, lasagna, & chicken parm combo). Portions are huge, if you go for dinner you'll definitely have left overs for lunch the next day. Be sure to save some of the garlic bread to take with you :) so good!"}
{"text":"Since they changed the menu the food sucks now. I used to love this place but we won't be returning. Pompeii pesto chicken was the best!"}
{"text":"THE VERY BEST Italian food we've ever had in Arizona.  Wish they'd come over to Chandler.  SOON."}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I come here at least twice per month. Never had a bad item. My favorite is the chicken saltimboca. Unless you are crazy hungry, order the half portions. They are plenty big!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good, first the crunchy garlic bread is amazing. The pepperoni sauce is unlike anything I've ever had!!! Always too full for dessert but people I have been with said it's so good too"}
{"text":"Yet another favorite. I have been there couple of times and I enjoy dining there every time. Once you get into the front door you are greeted by a friendly and smiling host/hostess. You know you are in Tagliani's when you see the unique plastered walls and the artistic pictures surrounding the place. The place is clean and well maintained. The servings are big, the salad was fresh and crisp. The place was packed and my meal was served on time, I didn't have to wait an hour for it. The steak was cooked to perfection and the baked potato was not dry at all. I gave Tigliani 5 stars because I was satisfied with the meal and service."}
{"text":"Been coming here for ten years. Their Veal Parmesan is the best I've had, and I've tried it many places. Their gnocchi with meat sauce is the closest I've ever come to my immigrant  Italian grandmother's."}
{"text":"Had another great meal with the build it pasta as just love gnocchi and bacon together.  Claim chowder was hot and delicious as the clouds opened during the rain today.  Between the app (great Calamari) delicious food and garlic bread today there just was no room for desert."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how very unhappy my wife and I were with our dinner and the service. I ordered a seafood pasta with scallops and shrimp. The scallops had not been cleaned correctly and had a briny gritty taste. There were two decent shrimp in the dish and the rest were small cocktail shrimp. The sauce was thin, bland, and greasy. I took two bites and sent it back. My wife had the special Parmesan crusted tilapia the fish was soggy and the pasta greasy and bland. I will never forget when the waitress came to see if we liked our food. She came to the table and soon as I said we were unhappy she left without a word and took and other tables order. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Good ambience, quick service, and above all great tasting food. The prices are competitive too. I was a fan of Olive Garden until a Professor I once worked for took me out for lunch to this place. I would never return to Olive Garden anymore because these people make the dishes tastier and the portions are larger than Olive Garden's. My wife, who was a bigger fan of Olive Garden agrees with me.   I would especially recommend the Eggplant Parmesan and the Spinach Manicotti.   The Enggplant Parmesan is usually on their discounted \"specials\" menu.   Tip: Try to find one of the coupons they send out in newspapers."}
{"text":"The food was ok,  but not my go to for Italian.  The steak on our sliders was like jerky but my meatball sliders were good.  The food was warm not piping hot.  I suggest visiting during happy hour,  which is all day on Sunday,  getting the antipasto platter and try a few other dishes. Check in on yelp and get a free onion ring platter."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant quite a bit. I've been coming here for a while now and haven't been led wrong once.  I love the build your own pasta dish options. I usually get the spaghetti squash with the rustica sauce. Super delicious! Their breads are great and the service is friendly.  I've also used their call in option to take food to go. Each time it's been great.  No complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Hello people reading reviews, This place was full on Valentine's day, that's when I went. I'll be a little easy on the rating since it was packed I knew good service isn't really served when it's busy. It was recommended by a friend to go here, my food was a bit greasy for my liking, I ordered chicken piccata, very very VERY oily. My boyfriend ordered plate of spaghetti, he liked his very original. In the end the server was spilling water on the floor and never came back after leaving for long periods of time. She always seem annoyed when we saw her and had attitude. Probably won't be back again to visit but it was sure an experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I chose this restaurant based solely off the fact that they allow dogs on the patio. We didn't set our expectations very  high, but we were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding service (ken was our waiter) and the terrific food. Ken made sure not only my date and I were accommodated for, but also took the time to get our dog a bowl of water and a bone as we were leaving.   I will absolutely be visiting this restaurant again, and I will be requesting ken as my waiter."}
{"text":"I live closer to the 83rd ave location but I continue to drive to the 59th location because of the amazing service."}
{"text":"Best Italian in valley!    Been going there since arrived in Valley in 1993!   We had our wedding congrats party there!   Or was it a baby shower!   Well both at time were great times and great food!  Love their spicy sausage rigatoni!    Miss their flat bread that was out of this world!   Tiramisu is best ever had"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years and it still remains my absolute favorite restaurant for Italian food in the Valley!"}
{"text":"The experience was so horrible I don't know where to start.  The service was slow, there was a hair in the food, (we didn't find that out until later) and the food itself was out and out poor.   The pasta was cooked to death, and I have a much wider tolerance for pasta then the gourmet standard.  It was still gummy.  To call it mediocre would be complimentary.  The only good that can come from my eating here is to warn others to stay away.  Gawd help me, I'd much rather have gone to The Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Good as usual... My hubby and I always get the baked spaghetti, which I highly recommend.   My rum and diet was a little weak but my husband says hi just have a high tolerance... ha ha   Overall we love this place!!"}
{"text":"My husband and his father love the veal Parmesan and my minestrone soup was great! Nice place."}
{"text":"Great italian restaurant.  I've been coming here for years. I usually get the build a bowl pasta.  I love that you can get spaghetti squash as a substitute for regular pasta. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"I like the look of this restaurant and think its a nice place to dine at. The food is pretty good, although I do not care for the calamari here and probably won't order it again. The pizza was alright too, but I am finding that my favorite thing to get here is one of their pastas. All of the serving portions were fair. This restaurant can be pretty expensive, but I think it is a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"We came back, after a personal invitation from the owner, after a so-so experience at the 59th avenue location. We decided to try out the 83rd (Arrowhead location) second time around. What a world of difference. Staff, service, atmosphere....all was excellent! Including the food. Complimentary garlic bread was delish, and we also started with a wing onion ring combo plate. Yummy wings :) I had the caprese side salad, small but really delicious and fresh and I had a make your own pasta dish with fettuccini, garlic butter, spinach and roasted onions. Butter was Lacking a little flavor, but none the less, very good and pasta was super fresh. My husband had the steak Gorgonzola over fettuccini with a side of antipasto salad. Again, very good. Manager visited our table....server was as sweet as could be. Loved the Italian family style atmosphere....we will be back. Thank you very much for the invitation to dine again :)"}
{"text":"A couple of disclaimers: Italian food is way down on my list of favorite cuisines I'm a pesto lover  My companion and I went for lunch today because it's my brother's favorite Italian restaurant and he loves Italian food. My other brother and his wife and I went for dessert one night. He said they had the best Tiramisu. It was heavenly!  My companion had the soup of the day, Tomato Florentino and I had the Ceasar salad. The soup was great and the salad was really good. She ordered Eggplant Parmesan, which I can't help but think of the old Michael Frank's song \"my baby cooks her eggplant about 19 different ways\". I had the tortellini with basil pesto which was supposed to have pine nuts in it. I was able to add 2 veggies to it also so I chose the Portobello mushrooms and roasted onions. (The best pesto tortellini I've had was 20+ years ago in Tacoma and it had pine nuts in it, never had it that way again)  She said that the eggplant was average, I didn't taste it since my baby wore out any chance of me liking eggplant by making it 19 different days. (She's not my baby anymore either). After looking forward to my pine nut pesto tortellini I was very disappointed to not find a single pine nut. There was just a slight taste of pesto. The portobello mushrooms were were good. (Apparently the pine nuts were ground up and added to the pesto for consistency).  If I had it again I would leave out the veggies and ask for 19 times more pesto sauce.  We both agreed that the garlic bread was very very good."}
{"text":"I went to the one at Arrowhead, which was my first visit to that location. I frequented the one on Dysart Rd when it was out there but it had since closed. I was a little disappointed with this visit. The food was mediocre and the service was less than stellar. Instead of bread they now bring giant crouton-type things. Good luck trying to gnaw on that, especially if you're dental work is a little iffy."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. The bread is always good, as is the pesto.  Sadly, the food has gone downhill. Over our past several visits, we had cold in the middle pizza, food waaay to salty only to come back with absolutly no taste at all when the waiter was called over, food too greasy (even for italian standards), food tasting like it has been sitting for quite some time, luke warm soup....this all breaks my heart. This place used to be a delicious splurge I looked forward to. The last time we visited which was a few months back, I left feeling completely ill. I want to love this place again, but every visit it just gets worse.    We have always had good service...the staff is attentive, smiling, kind and right on target."}
{"text":"**Edited:  My review is actually for a different location; I didn't realize there were too so close by**  I remember when this was Tony Romas....after it reopened as \"the new Italian Place\" I tried it and though, \"eh, it's okay.\"  I went back today to meet a friend and.... mmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm.  If you've read my other reviews, please know that I do eat food other than chicken Parmesan.  I've just been eating a lot of it lately.  So...I had the chicken parm and it was delicious!  The breading was amazing.  I feel, because of my frequent C.P. encounters, and because I have an Italian husband who likes to cook for me, I am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to good C.P....and this was terrific.  The decor is nice.  Charming and relaxing.  The booths are huge.  The service was great.  The water tasted horrible.  And that is my review."}

{"text":"We loved the dishes...the only problem is the half portions were not enough to fill a lady (me).  The waiter we had was a bit busy and not much of a people person.  There was a point when he dropped a fork on the floor and managed to kick it several times so that he did not have to put his stack of plates down.  Maybe he should have just put them down...it was a bit annoying.  He was not very good with refills.  Hopefully if you go you won't have this guy."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last Sunday afternoon, was a recommendation from a police officer we met. This place was fabulous! There is nothing like the smell of garlic from the parking lot that gets you salivating before you get to the door.  I had Mama's favorite which was excellent. Save a portion to take home for the next day and it was just as good. Can't remember what my wife had but she ate it all.  Going back this Friday with friends and to celebrate our anniversary. Really great Italian, good wine. Molto bene  Will definitely be taking guests here."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a group of 24.  We meet on a monthly basis and our group is growing.  They messed up our reservation and when we voiced our disappointment, they became defensive, threatening to throw my husband out of the restaurant, and our server was nasty.  They must have been having a bad night.  We are taking our group elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Glendale. The price is reasonable and their food is always hot and fresh. They also deliver on consistency which is great. I enjoyed the Pasta Tagliani and my daughter had the Pasta bowl with tortellini and lemon and caper sauce. Wet also had their wing ring appetizer of onion rings and buffalo wings. It was a nice beginning to the meal. We didn't have it this time, but I recommend trying their soups. I've enjoyed every soup I've ever ordered here. Treat yourself to their tiramisu for dessert. It's one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place alot...however we recently went to enjoy the live entertainment on the patio and found out that they allow smoking and left ALOT sooner than we wanted to....I thought there was a law :("}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 10 years.  It is way better than any other Italian place I know...especially the Olive Garden (ewe)!!  I usually get the same dish every time so I can't really tell you overall how the rest of the food tastes.  I order the angel hair pasta with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella on top.  Delicious!!!  I love their service and cozy atmosphere.  It is honestly my favorite restaurant and I have taken several friends who all agree that the food is wonderful and all of them are now returning customers.  My family, friends and I all love it!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why my dad and I were so in love with this place when I was younger, I remember loving this place but it has been so long that I totally don't remember what I ate. Okay first off serves was great the sever was very fast and gave amazing severs. I rate her 4 stars I like her a lot. Didn't get her name but appreciated her speed. She was excellent.  Food was at a good temp but the food wasn't something that was amazing. The value of their food isn't that great but on the bright side it's not horrible if I wear on a diet or when I do my sports again I'll probably come back because their angle hair was very light and okay didn't upset my stomic and I don't feel full from eating here I feel pretty light so I guess it's kinda healthy. My bf food was alright he got the fed i chin Alfredo  it tasted okay and light as well I say their food was fair but I would go back for a light meal  just because I like eating healthy  and the Sevres was good."}
{"text":"Another great meal. ....! Service was excellent and our entrees were all great!  The steak gorgonzola was flavorful with tender bites of steak,  the spicy sausage rigatoni was cravable! Clean,  comfortable surroundings and friendly fast service. ....going on our \"regularly visit\" list!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, service has always been slow, but the food was decent.  However tonight was the absolute worst ever!  Three of us walked in, were seated after the hostess had to deliver numerous take out orders.  We ordered cocktails, and asked for bread while we were waiting for the cocktails.  I noticed right off the get go, that the bread plates on our table were filthy, dried on food crud on the plates, the table was very sticky also and we asked our waitress Kendra to bring us three clean plates, which she fairly promptly did.  We waited, and waited, and waited, she brought the iced water we requested and a basket of bread, we ate our  way through one basket of bread, then another and Kendra came to our table and announced that they were out of orange juice for two of the cocktails we'd ordered (Italian dream), our 3rd person refused to drink her cocktail even though Kendra hadn't brought it to the table yet, and told her she didn't want it if we couldn't have our cocktails.  At this point I requested a coffee and Baileys, Kendra left and then came back and announced they were out of coffee!  REALLY?!?!!  This was 7:00pm, go around the corner to Walmart and buy some coffee and OJ for God's sake!!!  We waited again, another 10 minutes..finally our meals came.  Our third friend refused her plate, saying she couldn't eat it  and to take it back.  We finally asked for boxes to take the remainder home and asked for the bill.  Looked over the bill and found that we had been charged for THREE drinks of which we only had one that was refused and the other two could not be made. We addressed that with Kendra and she corrected the check.  On our way out, my friend stopped to talk to the Manager, who also stated he was the owner she complained to him about the service and being out of the most basic items for our meal.  All he said was \"The truck didn't come in today-Gee, sorry\" and that was it.  We will never go back there again!  We prefer to go to the Tag's on Bell, they are way better with service and addressing the needs of their customers.  I think this is the first really bad review I've ever written and I don't like to complain, but tonight was outrageous.  I do feel bad for Kendra, but after waiting so long, and her not even noticing how dirty the bread plates were...I only tipped her 10%, I will usually give 20 or better for good service-but not tonight!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place, we get the make your own pasta dish and split a large.  They have a whole wheat spaghetti, top it with basil pesto sauce, roasted veggies and chicken, delicious!  It would get 5 stars but our waiter was a little impatient and arrogant.  Second time we've had him and he doesn't seem to like his job.  Service was great, attitude, not so much.  Oh and a free pazookie for checking in with Yelp!"}
{"text":"Why, oh why am I SO picky about italian food?  I can't help it. my tastebuds have been offended more often than overjoyed in almost every italian restaurant I have been to since moving to Arizona.  This place was dumb. We were seated at this awful middle-of-the-room table and I felt like I was in a fishbowl. The decor was..... tacky.   You can tell that they are trying to be cute, so for that I guess I give them some credit, but the food did not measure up. It was average at best, and the focaccia bread that they bring you to start is mostly oil and fat with a bit of dough. Tasty? yes. Rapidly enhancing the obesity epidemic sweeping the nation? Also yes.  Sorry tagliani's, my mouth (and waistline) do not approve."}
{"text":"Great everything! Service was awesome and the food was to die for! I had Mama's special which was amazing along with shrimp scampi and stromboli for the guys and they loved it too! Spinach dip as an appetizer was so fresh and flavorful! Could not have picked a better place to eat! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Went in the other night and I must say I have never been so disappointment in my life. The waitresses were great but the food and the service we received from the manager were extremely disappointing. The food came out warm, not hot, and extremely bland. We went in for a party and were told they would be willing to split the checks. It took them, no lie, an hour and a half to figure out how to even do such a thing. They made everyone pay for their drink tickets first then their food items. The manager, Mack, just stood behind his poor waitress making snarky remarks about why they never do separate checks for large parties and never even offered a helping hand to the poor girl. The waitresses was so frustrated she at one point mentioned she would take on the responsibility of paying the entire tab. It was not her fault as the service we received from her was outstanding. The lack of support she received from her management was enough for me to never want to go back to this establishment. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this place. There are much better options with MUCH better service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed Sunday.  We were a party of six and no one walked away satisfied.  The quality of the food has really taken a turn for the worse.  Seems like everything is precooked, frozen and reheated.   This was my favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I went in this last Sunday around 1pm. Based on the parking lot I figured my sister and I wouldn't have to wait long for our food- it was less than busy. SPOILER ALERT that wasn't the case. After being seated we waited several minutes before anyone came to the table, only to then be told by the server she would return for our drink order (insert side eye). This is Arizona. It's hot. I need a beverage. Sure, I'm chubby and I probably get parched quicker than the average Jane, but still. So she comes back after several more minutes to take our drink order. Oh, and I do want to say our server was very nice and super friendly, no issues there. I finally quench my thirst and she takes our order, answering the question I had about dressing options. As in sauce dressing, not wardrobe advice.   After I placed my order I realized she didn't ask what I wanted as a side. So I decided to leave it up to fate... I was feeling like a rebel. So we get our food, actually pretty quickly and yes it was freaking delicious. I got the chicken wrap with creamy garlic sauce. The menu claimed it was supposed to have tomatoes but nada. And wouldn't you know I got onion rings as a side... Which (gasp) I don't like. I would've ordered something different had she asked, but owell it was my decision not to say anything. My sister got chicken parmesan, which I now know how much she loved because I had to listen to her go on about how much better it was than Olive Garden.  After ordering a slice of cheesecake to go (nooooo not for me, shame on you), we waited several minutes before being able to pay and leave.   I suppose I'd go back for the food, no surprise there, but hopefully the actual service will be better next time."}
{"text":"Good and basic Italian food. The marinara sauce on my eggplant parmesan had too much sugar but other than that the food was fine. Complimentary bread was dry and buttery. Didn't know this combination could exist outside of croutons.  I think my favourite part of dinner was the spumoni. The combination of chocolate chips and sliced almonds gave the dessert a crunchy texture that went well with the ice cream.  My server Claudia was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Nice environment, solid but not great food, fresh salads and soups, spaghetti squash was a good healthy choice, and the service(Ashley) was great! Temper expectations and you'll likely be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"A decent Italian place up near Arrowhead that is just OK.  Don't be alarmed by the tragically boarded up shopping center.  Been there a few times for lunch.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than an Olive Garden, but after each time I go there - nothing strikes me much to rush back for my next meal.   The insides feature faux brick, with painted on ivy, stacks of wine crates and tomato jars.  Oooh, aaah, bleh. Yesterday I had the marinara chicken with tortellini...pretty average.  I had a taste of the 14th St. pizza - very good, btw.  The pasta chips were ick.  They need to stop that, NOW.  The service yesterday was OK, a bit long, but OK.  A good-sized selection of menu items featuring chicken dishes, pizzas and a build your own pasta thing.  Yawn."}
{"text":"Last night, a group of about 30 met in the reserved back room to celebrate a friend's 60 birthday.  Our waitress, Nicole, worked half of the room while another waitress worked the other side.  Nicole immediately asked us who was all on our ticket as they were separating them at the start.  The meal was an appetizer, choice of salad, bread sticks, and 4 entree option for just under $18 per person, beverages not included.  Let me say the food was good, and Nicole, our waitress, was great.  The party started at 6:00 and by 8:30 some people were looking to cash out as a variety of ages were present, including small children.  About 15 minutes later, no tickets and we were told they were separating them.  They close at 9:00 and we finally paid at 9:50.  At one point, the entry was full of party goers waiting to pay with more spilling outside still waiting.  At one point there were 5 employees standing behind the counter.  Other than being told that technology doesn't always work, we were told nothing.  The staff, including the manager on duty, Mack, were defensive and rude.  Rather than offering an apology or explanation, we received an irritated 'thanks for your patience'. Party goers were getting more irritated as staff appeared to do nothing.  A comment was made about still being there for breakfast to which a waitress was happy to let us know they are open for brunch.  Someone else wanted a drink from the bar while waiting.  This was discouraged by staff as it would further complicate getting tickets printed.  Mack was asked about giving a discount, but said he couldn't without talking to the owner.    We FINALLY did get an actual apology from Mack after paying FULL price for our meals which took between 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours to cash out.  I have been in customer service and in no way was the situation handled professionally at all.  Your restaurant has a very real opportunity for staff coaching and training.  For the record, we still tipped our waitress above and beyond the included group gratuity as it wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"Gahhh! I mean... gahh!!  I guess the endless cheesy commecials finally got to me. Despite my instincts, and the signs -- cartoony logo, aforementioned cheesy commericals -- I decided to give it a try.  The decor was cozy -- chock-a-block with wine crates, fake vines, and the like -- but it actually worked in this case. Our server took a while, but was friendly, once she arrived.  I ordered a glass of pinot noir, and again, against my better instincts, I ordered the salmon. Past experience has told me than not many places can prepare salmon the way I like it -- a little crisp on the outside, medium-rare on the inside. But I gave it a shot.   First clue that was a mistake: my server did not ask how I would like it prepared.  Second clue: she was completely taken aback when I said, \"medium rare.\"  While we waited, we munched on some really delicious crisp and chewy bread, dipped in olive oil. My companion also enjoyed a  caesar salad topped with a nice, slightly fishy (in a good way) dressing and parmesan shavings.  When the entrees arrives, we both immediately said the same thing, \"oh my god, it's swimming in butter!\" Now I'm with Paula Deen on the butter issue. Butter is good -- but not 2 inches of it in my dish.  When I examined the salmon, it was nice and crisp on the outside. But as soon as I touched it with my fork, it fell apart. Alas, cooked until it flaked.  Once my companion fished the veal piccata out of the butter, she found it tough and nearly inedible. The piccata sauce lacked the bright lemon-garlic taste that it's known for. It was basically butter and capers. The pasta on both our dishes was fairly good.  All in all, I would not return. It was a half step above Olive Garden.  Lesson learned: Listen to your instincts!"}
{"text":"We had a great visit today at Cucina Taglianni.  Food was very good.  Service was wonderful;  friendly and efficient. Thank you Nicholle!  Happy hour all day on Sunday.  Great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"I went here the other night. It was my first time in. The service was great, very friendly staff. But the food was terrible. Very bland,  and with no flavor. The marinara tasted like ketchup. It was very disappointing. I had high hopes."}
{"text":"I have to be honest I have never eaten at the restaurant we always do take out.  I love the chicken parm it is by far my fav!! Tonight my husband had chicken Marsala and said it was ok but probably wouldn't have it again.  The girl working their tonight Erin I think was super nice.  It is a little pricey in my book, per person about $12-$15 and it is just the entree no salad.  I was also bummed tonight because they have a yelp offer for an appetizer if you check in, I asked if I could use it and she said it was only for dining in which it doesn't say and I have a one year old so I don't do a lot of dining in right now, take out seems to be the way to go!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat,  prices are very good for the portion sizes, service was very friendly, only I would recommend they hire more staff to take care of drinks, bread, etc.  All in all though, a very pleasant night out with my wife.  I will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service by our waiter Ken coupled with great pasta and salad make this place a must visit!  The pastas are done perfectly with an ample portion. The Caesar salad is made with anchovie paste and is delicious-possibly the best in town? The tiramisu is home made- delicious...."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place.  I come from a long line of italian cooks and this is as close to home cooking as it gets.  The portions are enormous and the flavors are authentically italian.  Service was super.  In addition if you sign up on their web site you get discounts on your meals.  Please try it - if you enjoy good Italian food."}
{"text":"Love this place. I wish there were more around the valley. I've never had a bad experience with the food here. The service is hit or miss, but who cares I came for the food. I love the wine deals mid week. The bread they bring before the meal is bomb! Usually you get dried out old crap bread, but not here. It's awesome. I always get the veal here it's awesome."}
{"text":"Our party of 20 came in at 3 o'clock in the afternoon after 3 softball games. We were pretty messy but encountered this absolutely amazing waiter with over 47 years of experience (Mo). He make sure we instantly had water, our drinks were here within three minutes and then he took our orders and brought lots of bread. It was really, really good bread. 20 different orders and Mo got everything correct. We added lots of photos and there is not one complaint in our entire group. The food was very, very good (unanimous)! Atmosphere was spectacular as we had a large room all to ourselves. If our drink needed to be refilled all we had to do was give him a nod and the drink showed up. As a team, I don't remember any time that we had such great service and our entire party was very satisfied.  We all highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now , you get a free appetizer for checking in here. I ordered the full size veal picatta and the veal parmigiana, the portion size is amazing to say the least , I can easily get 3 meals out of this, and it was very good. My companion orders the lasagna and a couple meat balls on the side and he really enjoys his dinners as well. We got a free order of bruschetta , and the tomatoes were very fresh . Has always been a pleasant dining experience . And good  to very good service , will be back again."}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the staff are very friendly.  If you're into East Coast American Italian food this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Seriously? The place is empty. One other couple. Our family is sitting in a room by ourselves with 24 empty tables, and you have to sit the next couple right next to us?  Can't skip even a single table?  At least then food and service is good."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with 12 people..I had a coupon for a soup and salad special. Waitress said if I used the coupon nobody else in our party could order off the special lunch menu. Food was okay but a very strange policy"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. It has a great atmosphere and they had a musician singing outside taking requests.   I absolutely loved the ambiance. I ordered Fettuccini Alfredo which was really good.  I had the \"Italian Dream\" to drink from their speciality cocktails and it was amazing!   The prices were very decent and the food was great. I would have rated five stars but my waitress was terrible, barely checking in and she forgot my second drink. Then when I said never mind she seemed annoyed with me."}
{"text":"Nothing bad, nothing great, service good. Will return to try again to see if I have the same reaction."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant since 2000 (mostly 59th and Bell.). Well, on Monday the 14 of May we went in for lunch to the Bell road location.  Yikes!!!!  My husband and I ordered our Stromboli first because it takes longer to cook.  My daughter ordered about 10 minutes later.  She ordered a spaghetti with meat sauce, fettechini Alfredo no meat, pepperoni pizza and a portabello mushroom sandwich.  Well, the Stromboli came on time.  Then one hour and 15 minutes later the other food came accept the pizza because they  forgot the pizza.  No cheese on the sandwich (which hold the whole sandwich together).  We asked several times about what the hold up was and both times we were told it would only be two more minutes.  Not.  The manager never came to our table but definitely visited others.  They didn't charge us for the pizza and gave us 20% off.  Not good enough.  We sat there after we ate our food and our family sat there watching us eating ours.  It was miserable.  Our waitress was friendly but unqualified and the manager worthless.  The food is delicious (except the sandwich) but what b do we do?  I don't know."}
{"text":"Good food with big enough portions to share with your date! Tables a little too close for my taste but it's a small place.  The service was timed out perfectly but the staff could use some more training in greeting their customers!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. I ordered the Papas favorite plate which contains lasagna, spinach manicotti and veal Parmesan. It was a generous portion but unfortunately the pasta under the spinach manicotti was uncooked. On a positive note the garlic bread did have the best salt and texture balance.  The service was great but unfortunately I wasn't a fan of the building smell and the bathroom maintenance. Overall I also thought it was relatively pricey and I would return if I'm craving Italian."}
{"text":"Here Is the synopsis.  1. Walked in at 4 pm. THREE employees walked by us and COMPLETELY ignored us. A server came out after 10 minutes and asked us how many. He grabbed menus and literally left us 20 feet behind him. We assumed he wanted us to follow him. 2. On RECOMMENDATION we ordered two appetizers. Calamari and artichoke dip. The artichoke dip was ok. The calamari I GUARANTEE is a very low end pre breaded frozen product. It was WAY overcooked therefore chewy and tough. 3. Daughter ordered a house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Dressing was a very odd texture. Overly thick and odd taste. 4. Entrees were Pizza...it was decent. Spicy sausage pasta.....it was laughable very poor quality. Tortellini Alfredo...it was decent. Pesto Chicken pasta...it had ZERO flavor. I do not know how that can happen but it did. 5. Three out of the four sets of silverware we were given had food remnants stuck to them. We asked for new silverware. Server response was \"Oh Boy\" New silverware arrived...getting better tis time two out of the three were dirty.  We wiped off the silverware with our napkins and went on.  All in all very disappointed. We had medium hopes and were totally let down."}
{"text":"We were  in the Phoenix area for the NRA convention and we stayed at the Choice Suites which happens to next to Cucina Tagliani, how Convenient!  We have enjoyed this establishment before and enjoyed our meals and decided to go back and weren't disappointed.  I had the Seafood Angelhair and my bride had Fettuccine Alfredo ( it's the only Italian food she likes) and both were great! We had the small order and still couldn't finish them. (Lucky for us I brought an ice chest and they survived the trip back to Torrance, Ca.  We will go back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Cucina since they opened up. To me, this is the best Italian restaurant. Thank you for another great dinner."}
{"text":"Been back several times and never regret it at all!  Very good and consistent food with good quality ingredients and flavor!  We almost always have leftovers and they are just as good the next day!"}
{"text":"The inside of this place is beautiful and the bread they start you off with is sooooo good. Wish the entree i ordered had more flavor though, i had the alfredo. But id be willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"First time here after my girlfriend keeps telling me how good they are. Ordered a salad and it came out with a long dark brown piece of hair in it. Ordered the chicken piccata..... let's just say I make it better at home. Very disappointing. I didn't even finish it because every time I took a bite of the pasta all I could feel and taste was oil. There was no spice to the dish at all. Just a pice of smashed chicken with some oily noodles. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Great food.  I had a party of 18 dining with me.  Sad that they only allow one server for that many people.  Poor girl had to keep up with a bunch of party people.  Food was awesome...except the spicy Italian sausage.  It was straight fire.  No taste.  Just torch.  Prices are fair.   Place was clean.  This is a good go to for date nights as well!  Me and my wife ordered lasagna which was PHENOMENAL! we both added an additional 2 sausages.  I got mild, wife choose spicy.  Her two sausages were too hot to taste.  No complaints at all on the food or service! Even with the spicy sausage not being good, I still feel everything was superb.  I just wanted to post about the sausage so people know not to get it unless they want fire lol."}
{"text":"Came on for a quick dinner, Chyna was our waitress and she was LOVELY! I will definitely come back and ask for her. Great food better service."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Cucina Tagliani for about 15 years since I've lived in the neighborhood, it's my favorite restaurant, with my favorite server Tanya :)  I also hosted a 30th wedding anniversary party in a private dining room there a few years ago.  So, when we were thinking of where to have our wedding reception it was a natural choice.  We reserved the entire patio for 50 guests, and hired the musician that is there on some Fridays, Bill Hranek.  He played at our church wedding (sounded beautiful!!!) and then moved on to the reception - played acoustic guitar and sang during dinner, then turned into a DJ and cranked things up after dinner!!!  It was absolutely perfect - the 5 entree choice menu (YUM!), the service, we decorated the patio with balloons, flowers, wedding cake table and colorful gift bags and Tagliani's set the tables with table cloths and votive candles.  Our guests had soooo much fun they didn't want to leave! I got tons of compliments, people are still talking about how much they enjoyed our wedding and reception. The waitresses even danced with some of our guests.  It was truly a magical evening made even better by the wonderful service and food at Tagliani.  Thank you Rhonda, Kelly, Tanya, Crystal, Kristy, Bill Hranek, Chef Danny and everyone else for our beautiful reception!  I hope you enjoy your visit to Tagliani as much as I have for all these years.  Try my favorite dish, Spinach Manicotti with Marinara and Alfredo sauces.  You might want to buy a gift card while they are having their Holiday special - you get a free $20 for each $100 you spend.  I paid for our reception in advance, so now I have free money on my card to use for dinners with my new hubby :):):)"}
{"text":"I've always liked Tagliani's. They have great food and an excellent atmosphere. The whole place is decorated with an Italian theme. There is a bar section with an outside patio and a main dining area that is quite large. This time they had a live musician in the patio area performing which was pretty cool.  My last visit had the worst service I have experienced out of all the restaurants I have been to. First, we reserved a table for 5 at a specific time. When we arrived they pushed us back 30 more minutes, AFTER the time we reserved in advance.  Next, after 15 minutes the waitress never came. Sat there with no drinks. We had to get up and complain and they a waitress would be by. Another 10 minutes pass, nothing. At this point we are about to leave but this was a dinner before a family member departed out of state and we really like the food. We complain again and then finally we had waitress after a minute.  But, things went even further down hill from here. We got our orders in finally and got some bread but didn't have any oil and vinegar so, we asked the waitress if she could bring some to the table. She leaves and then is no where to be found after 5 minutes so we just take it off the empty table next to us. I went to the bathroom after getting the oil and vinegar to find that waitress was just talking with other waitresses standing idly by, doing nothing.  While the food was excellent, the service was abysmal. There is a lot that needs to be improved at this location. I'm going to be steering clear of here for awhile."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. My doggies really enjoyed their dog friendly large patio area. Super dog friendly which is always plus. They have a really good selection of happy hour menu everyday from 2:30- 6:30 pm. Our server ms. Faye was very knowledgable and on point on her recommendations. Food was closer to five stars but since we only had appetizers, I am going to keep it 4 stars for now. You can get frequent dinner card which I think you can collect credits for free. You can get free appetizers on yelp check in. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"A bit of a let down. Pedestrian food, there are better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Just tried the Angel Hair Pasta with meat sauce and meat balls along with a small salad to take out, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We went here for my Birthday dinner. It was a nice big booth, plenty of room to relax! We didn't feel crowded like in a lot of places. Our server was great! Friendly and attentive.  (Thank you Anne Marie!) The food was delicious!  I had the Pasta Tagliani. The broccoli was cooked perfectly.  ( not over cooked)  for a birthday dessert  we were served Bread Pudding.  I thought I didn't like bread pudding... I was wrong.  This was great! Even as stuffed as I was... I had my fair share of the warm comfort dessert!  Yum!"}
{"text":"We got here and there were hardly any people because it's only like 5:15 on a Wednesday. Sat down and the table top was sticky. We ordered iced tea and a soda and the iced tea was so hot that she had to bring me an extra cup of ice without me asking for it. Then we started to get attacked by the Flies. The starter that she brought us was cold. So we just got up and left.  Of course I left money for the starter in the drinks but we will never come back here again. I can't believe it has three and a half Stars. Where have these other people been eating?    I was forced to give it one star just to post my review."}
{"text":"Our server was Claudia C and she was excellent. Being tired from our trip and the restaurant being close to the hotel we decided to eat.  I had the Mama's Combo, very large portion of food,  Mrs had Shrimp Scampi.  Started off with Zucchini appetizer, pretty good. Wife didn't enjoy her meal, wouldn't specify why, and I really didn't enjoy mine either.  The lasagna portion of my combo was burnt on the bottom.  Later that evening I became ill, I don't attribute it to the food.  Although my dinner had large portions it was rather bland to me, hence the 3 star rating, a average restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband went for lunch on Saturday and were disappointed.  It must have changed hands the decor had changed a bit and the bread was different (not in a good way).  The bread was very soggy like it had been sitting for hours and it was only lunch time.  The service was horrible even though there were only people sat three tables.  It was just not as welcoming and friendly as it used to be.  Though I hand't been there in few months it \"was\" one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, we were well taken care of! Downside was that the food took awhile to come out, so staff made sure we were distracted with bread in the meantime which became an overload. There is also an upcharge for every little thing on the menu, some you aren't aware of until you get the receipt"}
{"text":"Dinner with friends on a Monday night.  Greeted well and taken to a table we did not like so we were shown one we did, with no fuss.  The waiter was a smiling kind of guy with a voice that would do well on a Broadway stage. He by the way did a fine job in his waiterability.  All the food was presented well and tasted just as good.  A nice place for friends to have a decent meal while visiting with each other."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say there was a guy singing on the patio and the man had talent! This was my impression as I was walking up with my \"date\" anyway, he was singing some Jimmy Buffet song and entertaining a crowd of people on the patio. I thought ok, cool- maybe we should eat outside because he sounded pretty darn good. As we went inside, we were greeted by two darling hostesses who were super sweet. We choose to eat inside the bar area, so we could hear the singer ( I mean who doesn't want live entertainment) but inside where we were cozy and had AC, although the weather was nice outside in the late evening. We had a phenomenal bartender who waited on us and honestly she made my drinks perfect! Yes, I said perfect because that does not really exist but hands down, she was awesome! The food, fantastic and the portion was so huge that we both walked away with a another serving of food! We stayed until this place closed on Saturday night because it was such a great experience!  I recommend this place and when you go, expect excellent customer service and food! Yes, that's definitely what you will receive!"}
{"text":"Good wine and good food. Staff was friendly and a great atmosphere. Great for conversation. In a great area with lots to do."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio last Friday night - they had a wonderful singer who played everything - not so loud that you couldn't talk though.  The food was wonderful, service was good and the atmosphere was so nice!  Planning to bring a group this weekend!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is friendly and fast and portions are large, very large menu been many times over the years not a chain"}
{"text":"Ate here on recommendation, but would not recommend it to any friends of ours.  Food was okay...2 of 4 adults ate their dinners.  Service was very slow.  Bread was promised with dinner, but didn't make it.  Chicken Piccata sat in a pool of butter.  Lasagne & Fettuccini Alfredo also fell short."}
{"text":"Chris S. personally attacked me for disliking Cucina Tagliani. So, I would definitely listen to him when he asks you to consider the validity of these reviews. It may be upsetting for Chris to read such hatred in reviews, but it is more upsetting to get a message full of hateful personal attacks. I hope Chris isn't the owner, he seemed to be mighty emotional over the whole thing! I'm not the only one who hated this place, Chris. Are you going to attack us all?!"}
{"text":"the service sucks here!!! been sitting for  about 10 minutes!! i do not recommend this establishment ... we didn't even get our water!!!"}
{"text":"This place looked like it would be great, and I really hoped it would be great because we were looking for a great Italian restaurant. However, my experience here is not a very good one.  First, our waiter was not very good. He seemed a bit impatient because he was busy. I gave him a little pass on that because I think it's management's fault for giving him too many tables when he can't handle it. Like others have said, the bread is pretty good. I asked the waiter if they had oil and vinegar, and he said that he would bring me some. I ended up never getting the oil and vinegar. Our waiter would be rarely seen or heard from the entire night.  After being annoyed for the bad service, the food came out and it looked great. I was excited. Then a few bites into it, my wife hurt her tooth on something. She bit on a small plastic piece that came out of her spaghetti. We waited a bit for our waiter to come, but he never did. So I took the plastic piece and went to the kitchen door and waited......And waited...... Finally someone asked me if I needed help and I explained the situation. They said that a manager will be at our table soon.  Finally a guy came to our table and asked what the problem was. I said my wife found a plastic in her food, and he tried to explain it was the plastic that they wrap the lasagna in. I told him she didn't have the lasagna, and this was no plastic wrap. He didn't know what to say after that. He asked if they could remake it. Having to deal with this, our food was cold and we lost our appetites, so I just asked for my wife's order to be taken off the ticket and they took her food away. There were no apologies. He just kind of looked confused and took away her food. It was such an odd moment.   So I ended up paying for my food (that I didn't eat) and although we didn't have to pay for my wife's food, she didn't get to eat her dinner. I'm a bit weary of this place because if there is a hard plastic in our food, it makes me wonder what other things they accidentally drop in the food that we don't see.   I wanted to like this restaurant so much! But in the end, this restaurant fell way short. I feel that the situation was not handled in the right way. We left that place with frustrations and empty stomachs and lighter wallets. I sent them an email about this first and I never heard back from them.    To be fair, I'm giving them 2 stars because the food was actually decent before we found garbage in our food."}
{"text":"OK food with large portions. Vastly overpriced for sub par Italian food though. And the fake plants in the interior were covered in dust."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and the portions are enorous. I keep going back anc back."}
{"text":"Fantastique! It's Patio weather season!! And this location has a cute little patio. So naturally, that is where we sat, there were 2 large TV's so my husband could still keep up on his sports as Frank Sinatra and fun Italian tunes played in the background. The interior was a cute Italian theme with twinkly lights. When the waitress came to take our drink order (very friendly staff) she brought a basket full of different breads (all of which tasted the same but I didn't care because it was delicious!) We were there for Happy Hour (Everyday 2:30-6:30) and wow do they have a lot to choose from. We both got a glass of white wine. VERY BIG GLASS for 4.50. Awesome deal! To start we had the Clam's with a Lemon Caper Butter sauce. This was our first time trying clams like this and OH MY GOSH.... It was decadent! So perfect. Then for our main course we had the Steak Gorgonzola; sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, Gorgonzola cheese over fettuccine Alfredo. The steak was tender and the perfect amount of Gorgonzola cheese, so not to over power the dish! It was so hearty that it was perfect for us to share. And to finish it all off we got the 1/2 Chocolate Mascarpone Cake. I would say I liked this the least out of everything. It was a spongy, cake with really good creamy frosting. I'm not a huge dessert person, but I thought this cake was pretty average. But even the 1/2 was a very large piece. I think if I had some coffee, milk, or ice cream I would have enjoyed it a bit more. Next time! We cant wait to go back. And I will take some pictures. I completely forgot. I got lost in the cute tunes and the romantic setting."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to the Arrowhead Mall area you know its a haven for chain restaurants the world over.  Its part of the reason I go to other parts of town as I like to sample a more local flavor to mix it up once in awhile.  Well, its just one local restaurant, but Taglianis is a nice addition to an area of town in desperate need of a culinary identity.  (I should mention that I've been to this one as well as their original location on 59th and Bell and I believe they're opening a new location in Avondale.)  I've been going to this location for many years and have never left the restaurant disappointed.  Is it the best italian food I've ever had?  No.  But each dish I've had is consistently good and the portions are very generous.  They'll always start you off with bread and butter and you have the option of doing your own olive oil mix too.  For the main courses, the most popular dish of choice for me and most patrons is the \"make your own pasta bowl\".  Not one to mess with a good thing, I typically go for angel hair, marinara, and sausage.  Sometimes I'll get the fetticinni alfredo and mix in some seafood.  A regular size pasta bowl will fill you up and will run you about 10-12 bucks.  If you're really hungry you can get a full size bowl (be warned,its HUGE) for about 15 bucks.  (Note: If you come for lunch, I've found you can get usually these bowls for cheaper as lunch bowl specials are frequent).    They also have the usual italian favorites like chicken piccata, chicken marsala, sausage lasagna, and others.  All of which I've had and all of which are good.  The wine and beer selection is respectable, but nothing amazing.  The desserts are big and tasty with their signature Chocolate Mascarpone cake being their trademark.  All of their desserts are huge so sharing is strongly suggested.  If I could summarize this place, I would call it a family friendly suburban italian restaurant (kind of a cross between Oregano's and Olive Garden).  The food will leave you plenty fat and happy, the environment is laid back, and the service is pretty reliable.  Next time you're on the west side of town, give these folks a try.  Hopefully overtime establishments like this can give the big chains a run for their money here on the west side."}
{"text":"What a delight this restaurant is!  A big first is that while it was crowded while we were there, it was still fairly quiet.  A few tables over us, a couple had a baby that didn't look to happy.  At a moment like that I considered asking if we might move to a table on the other side of the restaurant but was it worth the bother?  The decor is what you might find on a piazza of an Italian village. I can tell you at Concia Tagliana somewhere in the walls and ceiling which are festooned with trellises and leaves and strings of lights is some mean soundproofing.  I rarely ever hear the little rug rat!    The service was excellent.  My friend uses a wheel chair when we go distances.  Not only did someone offer to hold the door as we came in, the hostess offered to take the wheel chair in a back room as soon as we were seated without my asking.  A little thing but really appreciated.  We were seated next to a couple that were finishing their dinners.  They told us they had been coming there for years. Their meals looks so good that we just ordered what they had-no need to look at a menu.  Norma's salmon was to her satisfaction which is saying something. She's particular about food and one doesn't hear the word's very good from her that often.  I had eggplant parmesagn which was fixed as well as I could ask for.  When they served these, they were at a temperature where we culd start eating them immediately.  The fact that the manager brought them out, himself, tells me there were not going to sit and get cold.  No, the food was like poison and such small portions, here.  There was more than enough food to have it boxed up for another meal at home.Kari, our waitress, who did an excellent job not only boxed everything up, but put the salads and the entrees in seperate containers, wrote what was in it and whose it was.  To make it even better they were bagged when she brought them out!  That  quality of service really stands out for me..  I am happy to say that reviewing this restaurant gives me a perfect platform to discuss some of my pet peeves.  The first is the size of the  they glasses they use for water and soft drinks.  We live in Arizona where it is HOT in the summers.  More than a few restaurants use glasses that as soon as you sit down and quench your immediate thirst, they have to be filled up again.  My kingdom for a decent size glass of water for a change.  Cucina Tagliani gives you large bordering on huge glasses of what ever you order.  Our server didn't even have to think about refilling the glasses, her concern could be with getting the meal served proper.  This alone would be good for half a a star from me.  My second pet peeve started flashing red lights for me when Kari said we could have a salad to go with our meal for ninety nine cents.  When I hear that I immediately envision a salad of size that would have to go past a mirror twice to get a reflection.  Norma likes a salad. though, so for that price I said let's do it-against my better judgment.  I was shocked when she brought out two salads that were large, fresh and inviting!  Even by the size of the regular dinner salads one sees at most places, these were generous.  This was good for a star just on his own.  My third pet peeve is the \"complimentary bread\" that gets served, especially at an Italian eatery.  Usually there is an end piece that looks like are risking your bridge work if you bite down on it.  Aside from that, the rest will be ok but not something to write home.  We won't even talk about the fact that it almost always takes two baskets to be sufficient. It's a given that another one will have to be requested. Here the three slices of bread were light and fresh, no ends,  perfect to dip in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar you tke out of the basket on the table to mix on the extra plate set for that at the table.  About the time I was ready to request a second basket, what was delivered but another basket of bread as nice as the third.  I like this place.  I will share a final moment of horror that occurred for me at Cocina Tagliana when we requested our check.  We never looked at the menus which also mean we never looked at the prices.  Based on the quality of the food, the large servings, and the really good service, I was questioning whether I was going to have to sell  my first born, if I had one, to pay for the meal.  My last pleasant surprise was how reasonable the amount of the check was!  In addition to that, a short survey was attached to the check.  They asked some questions I would want to know if it was my establishment.   It is obvious they are concerned about staying above what is just sufficient.  It is working!  Before I make Cucina Tagliani sound like an Italian eatery Nirvana,  let me say one thing,  I have had better Italian food at higher prices in more sophisticated establishments..  So many things come together right here that for a neighborhood eatery, I don't think I could have asked for much better.."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant with good food and good prices. We love the option to have spaghetti squash with our meal rather than pasta; some dishes like the Chicken Parmesan and Chicken Picatta are perfect with the squash option. Really love their mussels with marinara (with hot crushed red pepper). Great happy hour specials on starters. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Tired menu, tired food, tired carpets and furniture. My food was passable but uninspired. The salad was pre-plated and came directly from the fridge, with ice cold plate and ice cold ingredients and a plastic \"to go\" container of bland creamy garlic salad dressing. A chicken artichoke sandwich was edible but not enjoyable. I didn't hate the place, but I see no reason to return. Might have caught a bad day, of course, or ordered the wrong thing, but its nearly-empty parking lot during lunch might be a clue."}
{"text":"I took my XC team here and called early in the day for a reservation. They had a side room for us, which was great, but still had to wait for 10-15 minutes to be seated. I sat out in the main dining area with my other coaches and received excellent food and service. We finished and paid and went to check on the kids, knowing it would take longer to serve 20 kids. We were shocked to see they only had drinks at this point, and quickly discovered that only one waitress had been assigned to serve 20 kids. Salads started coming at this point, but it took an hour and a half before they got their food. I asked them to bring the checks immediately after the food in order to speed things up, and asked that they include the tip in the check to make things easier (high school students don't get the concept and I still wanted the waitress to get a tip despite everything). They said they would, but then did not include the tip, which slowed things down even more. There was still only one waitress handling all the checks, and at this point there were very few patrons left in the restaurant, yet management did not get her the help she clearly needed in order to expedite service. It took over two hours to serve my group. I understand a large group takes more time to serve, and am ok with that. Management did not seen to understand what is necessary to serve a group this large. In the future (if we return) I will make sure to request sufficient waitstaff for the group or simply drive a little farther to the Bell Road location in Peoria where management understands the logistics of serving a large group.  Just to be clear - the food and prices were great and the staff perfectly friendly. All the issues we had could have been solved simply by having an appropriate number staff to serve the large group."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were there for a Friday evening dinner. Ashley was our waitress and was training a new person, they were both very enjoyable and the meal was excellent...I have only been there a couple of times and it has always been good food as well as good service!"}
{"text":"a Tuesday at 4 pm...once we seated ourselves (because no one there when we walked in), service was great. Food was mediocre, fine if you like ready prepared food with sauce/cheese put on top to resemble freshly made. Bread with butter/garlic was very good. First time there, will not return."}
{"text":"First, I have been a customer of Tags since the 59 ave and Bell restaurant opened.  I have seen the evolution of this family owned restaurant and then their expansion in opening two other Tags in the valley.  The poor rating I have to unfortunately give Tags has not been my experience until recently, say the past year or so.  Much of their problem I think can be reduced to poor managment and consequently poor oversight and customer service.  The past three experiences I have had at Tags have left me wondering if I will return again.  On one occasion I ordered a margarita and was delivered what is called a tag margarita, something that was not what I wanted nor ordered.  The waitress told me that this particular drink was the only type of margarita they offered, for 8.95.  I got the impression, rightly or wrongly that this was an attempt by the waitress to pad the bill.  I later went to the bar and asked the barmaid if they did in fact make a traditional margarita to which she told me they did.  On this particular occasion I ordered their Romano Chicken dish and was served an entirely different chicken item.  The server realized the mistake once she placed the meal in front of me.  Then my wife found a hair in her meal that she ordered.  I normally would chalk all this up to simply a bad experience that needed to be weighted against all the previously good experiences we had had at Tags.    My wife and I again returned to Tags about a month ago, hoping that things may have improved.  I think it is the one establishment that we would give second, third and fourth chances to.  We sat on the patio and ordered a half order appetizer of their calamari.  It was obvious to us that the portion size was considerably smaller then on previous visits, as we normally would order the calamari appetizer.  When our orders arrived again, I did not receive what I had ordered.  When the waiter placed my meal in front of me, I asked him what I had ordered.   He said, \" Penne noodle, rustic roma sauce, and it looks like...hhhhmmm...meat?\"  The poor guy couldnt even read his own writing, so I guess I cant fault the kitchen staff for making the wrong meal.  I had ordered a pasta bowl of penne nooodles, rustic roma sauce and mozzerella cheese.  He asked if I would have liked to send it back, but my wife already had her meal and had I sent it back she would have been done by the time my meal was served.  There was no offer of taking the meal off the check or getting the manager to visit our table to see how things were.  Again, I think this goes back to some management issues with this particular restaurant.  Due to Tags expansion, many of the more proactive managers, Rhonda being my favorite, were sent to the newer restaurants to manage them.  Unfortunately that has left  the 59th Ave Tags with a manager that is not proactive in his customer service nor congenial in nature.  It seems that this is reflected in much of the staffs attitudes also.    It is my hope that Tags will return to its previous place as one of our favorites, but I wont be one that will hold my breath until that happens."}
{"text":"Of the two Cucina Tagliani Restaurants, this is the one we generally go to.  Tonight my wife and I decided on Italian and Tagliani's was the destination.  When we arrived, we found that half the parking lot was coned off and at the time, around 6:15 pm, was generally empty, while the other half of the parking lot was completely full.  No place to park, but why would half the parking lot be coned off and not used?  We did see some motorcycles there and it appeared that the local Harley dealer was doing some sort of promotion using the Tagliani parking lot.  We ended up parking in the IHOP parking lot next door...sorry IHOP for intruding upon your parking lot.  Upon entering, we asked the hostess why half of the parking lot was not being used for customers and was told it was bike night, so that half of the parking lot was being used for biker enthusiasts.  I told her that is was rather inconsiderate to their more loyal clientele to show them such disregard by not allowing more parking for those customers that arrived more traditionally in a car.  Secondly, Tagliani's is not the kind of restaurant that would be considered a biker destination.  Now, considering it is located just on the outskirts of Sun City, it would seem to me to be more geared toward the retirement community, but who am I to determine the clientele they are seeking to attract.  The restaurant was not busy, maybe half full at the time of our arrival.  Our waitress seemed a bit flustered, failing to ask us if we wanted anything to drink, though she did take an order for an appetizer.  Ultimately, we did get our drinks, though she wanted to ask us what we wanted for a main course before our appetizer even arrived.  This has to be my biggest pet peeves with servers, as it gives the impression that we are being rushed through our meal.  Nothing is more aggravating than having your main course arrive while you are still enjoying your appetizer.  UGH....This probably is more a training issue for this particular server than anything, but it happens more often than not, so maybe it is simply the common expectation.  The food was good as usual, no complaints there, but the meal is just part of the experience when you go out to eat, as there are many other interactions that can detract from the experience.  I would suggest to the management at Tagliani's that in the future, if they want to have  a Bike Night, they should cater their food over at the Harley dealership rather than impose upon the regulars the inconvenience and ultimate feeling of lack of appreciation for loyal patronage."}
{"text":"Just read Korina A's review.  She's puts it best.  The service was fine; its just that the food sucked.  Bad.  And the wine list is way too pricey to not even list what the hell they're serving when you order a cab.  Garbage.   Just stay away."}
{"text":"Just ordered pickup and the service was excellent, I got the pasta Tagliani, it was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time. Every bite had flavor, the noodles cooked to perfection and the broccoli too... I recommend this place %110!!!"}
{"text":"I will always have a place in my heart for Cucina Tagliani.  Having been raised near their 59th Ave and Bell location, I can't help but love it.  Their happy hour was pretty good... I like how nicely decorated and LARGE this place is.  It's not cramped at all.   The service was excellent and the food was great... nothing at all to suggest as an improvement."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!! There are a variety of menu options, I love the pick your pasta.  If you are looking for a healthy Italian restaurant that is also really delicious, I would highly recommend Cucina Tagliani.  My favorite dish is the spaghetti squash with rustic Roma sauce and then whichever add in I feel like, usually a meatball or eggplant.  You can also get a 1/2 portion, which is a perfect portion size.  I also love the Portabella mushroom appetizer.  Other tips, Tuesday is wine night, 1/2 price of a bottle of wine and if you don't finish, they will re-cork it so you can take it home.  Happy hour menu is really good too.  Not sure what time it starts, but Happy Hour goes until 6:30."}
{"text":"Checked in on Yelp to receive the free onion/wings appetizer.   Dish comes with four dipping sauces.  The onion rings have a corn meal batter which was good.  We ordered the medium hot sauce in the wings and everyone thought it was warmer than they prefer.    Four adults for dinner ordering spaghetti and meatballs, sausage lasagne and spinach manicotti.  Everyone liked their entree and the garlic ciabatta bread.   Cozy atmosphere in the bar area.  Looks like a good drink and food menu for a Happy Hour.  Will have to come back and try that."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very nice meal here tonight with my party of 13 for my grandfather's birthday. Love the selection of pastas and even more so, the selection of non-pastas as well! Not every place will offer spaghetti squash, low fat marinara and veggies for those of us watching our calories. The pizza was delicious, the lasagna was very tasty. The chicken parm was perfectly done. Our server, Ashley, did a great job keeping up with all our drinks and needs.The only thing I wish was different was that we should have been put in a more private location due to the size of our party. Instead, we were parked right smack dab in the center of the dining room. Kind of made it difficult to talk with our other family members as it was pretty busy. Overall though, I was very impressed and look forward to a future visit!"}
{"text":"The clams are great the pizza was ok. Service was good and the prices are fantastic. Absolutely would come back. Not a huge fan of themed places cheesy Italian music is not needed."}
{"text":"I have tried multiple different Italian food places throughout the Valley and nothing in the slightest compares to Cucina Tagliani.  Let me start with the decor first and get that out of the way.  Yes, it looks like an italian village or something.  However, isn't that what you expect going to an Italian restaurant?  It sets the mood and why it may not be the most original it works.  Now for the food!  Wow!  The best part is the pick-a-pasta option.  You choose the type of pasta you want, with the type of sauce, and the added meats,veggies, etc.  You build your entire meal and it has never failed.  There are over 10 options of pasta, like 7 types of sauce (which all are delicious depending on what you like), and the add-ons range from meatballs, to chicken, to sun dried tomatoes, and on.  There are plenty of options for everyone.  I usually get the tortellini with either the Dynamante sauce (spicy) or the meat sauce (red wine sauce).  Then add sundried tomato, ground sausage, and mozzarella...TO DIE FOR.  My girlfriend always gets the gnocchi with tomato-fredo sauce, meatballs, and mozzarella.   Not only can you do this but if you order the half size, you get a big portion, but if you order the full, then you get a massive portion to last you anohter day lol  And if you ask nicely, on the full, they will allow you to pick 2 sauces and have half as one, half as the other.  So if you are indecisive or just wanting to try a ilttle of everything, it works.  They have plenty of the classic staples as well from lasagna, to chicken alfredo, and pizza for those who just want classic italian food and each is prepared perfectly everytime.  I love that all the sauce is prepared that day so you can tell the slgith difference every time you go in.    It is very affordable and won't break the bank.  The caprese salad is AMAZING as well with the best balsamic vinegar I have ever taster, and the service is almost always great.  I have been to all 3 locations and never been disappointed.  Oh and their desserts are pretty good if you have room (I suggest the marscapone cake)!  Just like any restaurant, servers may or may not be busy totally on top of it but when they do ask if you need anything, they will get you anything and quickly so just bare with them on a busy night.  But as for the overall grade at Cucina Tagliani, nothing but the best.  Everyone I have taken there has become a loyal customer now.  and with my 2 year anniversary coming up this Monday I know I will be enjoying another great meal there!"}
{"text":"I got a mailer from this place that had all their happy hour specials listed, they looked like awesome deals so we decided to go on a double date here.  The hostess wasn't the friendliest, she kind of made us feel like we were bothering her.  Luckily when we sat down our super sweet server Alice came by & turned that right around.  We checked in & started out with their free onion wings app which is half onion rings, half buffalo wings. Awesome deal! I ordered the Monsoon Madness which was only $3.50, it was a little sweet for my taste but not bad for the price. Our appetizer came out & my husband was a little disappointed with his BBQ wings weren't very flavorful.  The onion rings were pretty good, they weren't greasy at all.  We then ordered another cocktail, fried mozzarella & a small cheese pizza. The other appetizers were just okay, nothing really knocked my socks off. The atmosphere was cute & our server checked on us frequently. For 2 cocktails, 2 beers & 3 apps our total came to $24. Not bad at all! We may try it again soon since the pasta selections sounded great."}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad.  Had the lasagna.  Sauce was a little plain.   Customer service was great and the place looks very nice."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years!! I have never had bad service and everything I've eaten here is amazing!!! This is by far the best Italian food in Phoenix!!! Great food, great staff and service, can't ask for anything else!!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was horrible. With all the other Italian places in the area, why pay to feel like its a such a hassle for the server to take a drink order after sitting for ten minutes. Don't even think about a refill. Honestly the only thing they did fast and with out a problem is give us the check. I can see why that place thinned put after happy hour on a Friday. Too many better choices around to  deal with poor and slow service."}
{"text":"Went there for a graduation dinner for 25 people and there were 2 other large parties there at the same time. That would make people nervous, but the service was phenomenal, the food incredible and we couldn't have asked for more. They made our special dinner on a very special day wonderful and perfectly executed.   We had pasta, bread, salad and drinks ranging from iced tea, to italian soda and wine. It was all cooked perfect, arrived at the right temperature and was incredible! My family is from Northern Italy and that is the only italian food we will eat out. Some people may write bad reviews, but they probably also prefer Olive Garden. Olive Garden is fine, but there is no comparison to Cucina Tagliani.  Been there so many times and service and food always leaves me wanting more. Can't wait til next time!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting the 59th Ave location for years. Last night, we went with some friends to this location and, the food was as good as it has always been. The service was a little slow and, I guess they wanted us to leave because they turned up all the lights.  Hmmm. I will stick with 59th Ave"}
{"text":"Their bread is so good!  Lunch Special with the Eggplant Parmesan was delicious!  Chicken Alfredo on the other hand was terrible, so bland and so chunky, GROSS!  But then the yelp deal with the free spumookie sealed the deal.  so good!  EDIT* Forgot to add the Waitress comped the Alfredo, she was super nice, not to mention her attentiveness despite her being the only waitress, and busser for the shift.  The Sauce was gross, soggy, the chicken was not bad.  It just tasted old"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was very underwhelmed by my experience. Everything we ordered was subpar from the garlic bread that tasted like it has been sitting out since yesterday to the calamari to the build your own pasta and papas b favorite. Papas b favorite seems as though it was made and frozen and microwaved again. It's a super cute place but literally everything we ordered tonight was not good at all. Our waitress was fine and when we told her we didn't like anything she took our plates back to the kitchen and came back and said they took both plates off our check, we didn't even ask for it nor did a manager come out and talk to us which tells me that this happens a lot and it's just a normal thing they deal with. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I don't post a lot of reviews and I also usually don't complain when I have poor service and subpar food. I just feel this needs to be said, I have never in my life had such a horrible experience at a restaurant. I went here with my mother and father,  and we where very optimistic because the decor was fantastic. Once we got our drinks we didn't see our waitress to take our order for 15 min( by itself not a big deal). Then we waited an extremely long  time for our food, which was odd because the place was pretty empty. My father digs into his pasta which he then deems  flavorless and inedible. They offer to bring out a replacement but we told them we didn't wanna wait another long period of time for more food. The manager no less has an attitude about it and says \"well if that's how you feel\"and storms off. Making no attempt to rectify the situation in a way that we found appealing.I then give my father half of my manacotti dish. Which as we both dug in we found  was crunchy and hard like plastic. We told the manager again about our new  complaint and with the same attitude tells us  that we have to pay for this  because we already ate some of it. Why should we have to pay for inedible food? She finally relented and gave us 20 dollars off our entire bill which is outrageous considering these are 18 to  20 dollar entrees. In reality after all of the issues we experienced and the awful customer service we received, we shouldn't have had to pay a dime. I'm actually amazed this place doesn't have worse reviews based on the treatment we received from the manager and the fact the food tasted like those microwave meals from the grocery store. We all left feeling extremely insulted. What has happened to customer service"}
{"text":"We received prompt and friendly service.  Plenty of options to choose from, some being low carb options.  I had the baked spaghetti squash and it was amazing!  We also had the antipasto plate.  It was huge and had a ton of variety.  Our waitress was helpful and very kind.  As out of town visitors, we are now wanting to come back and visit to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went to Tags last night for my birthday with my friends and family and had a great time! The pace of meal was perfect, plenty of time for talking and enjoying ourselves! Had the chicken parm, it was ok, not crispy though! Next time we will eat the one on 59th because I remember the food there being better, we shall see! Service was fantastic and food is pretty good for the price! Must have the mascarpone cake!"}
{"text":"When we walked in the door, it took several minutes to be \"greeted\" by the hostess who was talking behind the bakery case with another  employee.  She asked how many and I said two.  She said, \"oh, to go?\"   I said that since she asked how many, I answered \"two.\"  She brought us to a table and literally through our menus on the table.  She neither greeted us nor told us to enjoy our meal.  She was quite rude. Our server was very nice. The meal:  I ordered cioppino.  It was absolutely the worst.  It was mostly green pepper chunks.  Why?   Green peppers do not belong in cioppino.   It was overpowered by oregano.  It was really a bowl of chunky tomatoes seasoned with peppers and oregano.   Upside-the garlic bread was good.   My Italian Margarita was so so.  It didn't even attempt to give me a \"buzz.\" The bakery case had a display of desserts.  One platter had cannolis on it.  One was all crushed up.  very unappetizing.   My husband ordered eggplant parmesan.  The sauce was very sweet.  The eggplant (one slice) was overcooked.  The whole meal was barely lukewarm."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service...  a fun little spot for date night or a bunch of friends getting together... full bar, booths and tables ... Romantic Italian music in the background... cozy and yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Cucina Tagliani... cute Tuscany style inside with booth and regular table seating. Service was prompt and food came out quickly. If you check in, you get an onion wing combo for free... that's normally $8.99 or something like that. Pretty good deal if you ask me :). Our server brought our waters and garlic bread after taking our drink orders. The garlic bread was tough and chewy - I didn't care for it.   Appetizers: Onion/wings combo - 6 naked wings; we asked for the sauces on the side Zucchini fritters - fried zucchini coins; they were okay - not bad clams in spicy marinara - the marinara wasn't very spicy but the clams were well prepared; not over or undercooked.  Entree:  Spicy sausage rigatoni - generous portion and it was tasty however, I was expecting sausage where they came out more like a meat sauce/ground meat.   Dessert:  Cannoli - I don't like cannolis... this was ordered for the table but I had to try the filling anyway cuz I'm a growing girl. lol The filling was gritty ---this just solidifies the fact that I am never going to be a true Italian. Oh well - I'm going to stick to being Asian.  With so many options around - I'd probably wouldn't be back unless my Italian parents want to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch had the Cicero calzone it was very tasty and very large we shared it waitress brought lots of crispy bread when we ordered it was very good and crispy unlike other places where it's soggy and the lamp the portions the portions are quite large and if your  and not too hungry you can share your meal total bill was $13 and we came away satisfied thank you  Taglioni's for another great dining experience this is my favorite Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"My son and I have been eating here for years and it is consistently enjoyable. We always get their pasta with meat sauce, a half portion is enough for the both of us. Their house made italian dressing is so good I could almost drink it ! The prices are right and the servers are always efficient, but our waitress today was especially awesome. Being in the restaurant industry myself I especially appreciate good service, and it's not always easy to find. Katie was spot on and really sweet, wish there were more like her  !"}
{"text":"Decided to try them the other night since they are around the corner from the house.  Delicious food, quick service, an overall good experience.  We sampled the sausage lasagna, the veal parmesan, and fettuccine alfredo. I thought the food was quite good.  A decent if not small wine list.  I noticed another Yelper made a comment about \"Pedestrian at best\" and that his son who has \"restaurant experience and is now attending a premier culinary school, pronounced the sauce as something from a can\".  My father in law is Italian and makes his own sauces from scratch, so I am pretty sure that is not the case.  No offense to them, however if \"that garden place\" was Olive Garden then that says it all. Of course everyone is entitle to their opinion.  Personally I will go back the next time I am looking for Italian food."}
{"text":"Nothing but amazing things to say about this place! It was my first time here and I was attended by Faith, the most amazing woman ever. The food is really great.. She recommended Alfredo ravioli with spinach and brown sausage. (to die for!) my boyfriend got angel hair, Alfredo and bacon + chicken. We both loved it and had fresh Parmesan and wine. Over all, wonderful food. Not everyone can't get their food AND their wine right."}
{"text":"We always enjoy Tagliani. We come here on a normal basis (whenever we want Italian). The wait time never seems to be too long if there ever is one. The happy hour deals are great. The complimentary bread is delicious and the artichoke dip appetizer is TO DIE FOR  the entrees all are great as well, some better than others but always come in a good portion size and I usually have some left to take home. The service ranges from average to great but nothing horrible. I would always recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here for our one year anniversary dinner.  We were trying to find a place that was close by, locally owned, and a place we could call our spot.  Well, we found it!  The manager called to confirm reservations that I made online and he offered us a great private table since we were celebrating our anniversary.  The waiter James came in and congratulated us and was great the entire night!  He gave us our privacy, but made sure we had everything we needed!  He even bought us dessert!  Our food was also delicious!  I had build your own pasta and my wife had a spiced shrimp pasta dish that she loved!  I'd say this place is great if you're celebrating an occasion like an anniversary or even a place to take friends and family for some delicious food at great prices and a super friendly staff.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went into restaurant yesterday for lunch. I have highly praised this restaurant in the past with great food and great service so I was excited to be stopping in again. I have to say the food was good but lacked sauce on lasanga. Service was bad. Real bad. Jaime was a real good waitress but has since left and this was first time I had been in since she has been gone. Service was horrible! Waitress was unprofessional and unfriendly. We asked for Parmesan cheese to top our lasagna and she was very skimpy with cheese. Acted like she was personally paying for it out of her own pocket. We didn't order drinks just water and she seemed to be annoyed that we were only drinking water. When we asked for additional marina on lasagna she charged us $2 extra on bill. If it would have had enough sauce on it we wouldn't have had to ask for more sauce. My experience really sucked and I'm very disappointed since I consider this one of my favorite places to eat. Don't think I will go in for a very long time if ever I decide to go back"}
{"text":"Well, I hate coming online to give a negative review- I try to be fair... but I have to be honest! I have been to this location before, and it had been a LONG time, since I moved out of the area. My family and I had a gift card and thought we'd give it a shot. We showed up moments after the restaurant opened and were the only ones there the entire time we were eating. Our waiter was lovely, kind, and had a great attitude. But that is where the pleasantries ended. One of the items ordered had chicken, and the chicken came back that it was \"out of stock\"- so we ordered the meal without chicken. No big deal- but it was! The sauce (the main reason for ordering the dish) was awful- like gravy, not wine and barely edible. Had to be sent back- very rare. Same with the Calm Chowder soup my 83 year old grandmother ordered. She only had 2 bites! I will not be returning, even with a gift card!"}
{"text":"Well honestly, this used to be my favorite Italian place. I'm always one to choose small, independant, west side eateries over big chain ones. That's why I ALWAYS chose Tagliani's. After today's visit though, I think I'm finding a new place. We went there with a coupon and thank goodness we did.   First let me mention that we couldn't find a menu with prices anywhere online. So, I ordered my favorite (baked spaghetti squash with marinara/alfredo \"rose'\" sauce and 2 meat balls) because I haven't been there in quite some time. My goodness the portions have changed. One of the reasons I came to Tag's was for the portions and cheap prices. I got NEITHER! My baked spaghetti was a whopping $28 and change! The idea behind getting this whole dinner was to have it for two nights. There are both a small and large size. I ordered the large (+meatballs $3.50 for 2). He ordered a Papa's Combo with diablo sauce (big mistake there!) Mine came with an abundance of sauce, which I'm not complaining about. His on the other hand was just a shame. We thought that the diablo could be added to the marinara. Nope, wrong about that guess.  I've included pictures of both our dishes. And if you look back to other pictures of the baked spaghetti squash, you can clearly see the difference in size. Needless to say, I'm HIGHLY disapointed with what used to be one of my favorite places to go. And I'm not sure if and when we will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a family dinner lasagna, take-out.  It says it feeds 2-4, so to be safe, I ordered two orders of them.  Got home, opened it, only one order in there. The single serving of lasagna was the size of my very, very small hands (seriously, I have freakishly small hands).  It would nicely have fed a single person with a moderate appetite, but nowhere near 2 people or a family.  Needless to say, we did not all eat that for dinner. :-( Two of us (females with smaller appetites/stomaches) split it.  The lasagna was ok tasting, reminded me of boxed lasagna.  The family dinners come a garden salad or caesar.  We got the garden salad, which was mostly iceberg lettuce and not really anything else.  Family dinners additionally come with a piece of cake, which was actually a generous size (the same as the lasagna), and was the only part of the dinner that was not disappointing.  We personally will not be back.    I'd suggest eating in, not taking out, and not ordering anything family-sized anything there."}
{"text":"Since my last review the menu has changed a few times for the better. Also since my last review I've dined at several Italian Restaurants in the Scottsdale area that offer similar meals at much higher prices that aren't as good so I feel the need to update my review.  This is a family owned and operated budget Italian Restaurant that's been a pillar of the area for over twenty years. Nothing comes pre-made all the food and sauces are prepared in-house. Portions are large and prices are low. No other restaurant that I know of offers around a half dozen fresh vegetable choices for your dinner nightly. If your not a fan of pasta you can alter your dish to be prepared with spaghetti squash instead. Although the restaurant isn't gluten free they do offer gluten free pasta and whole wheat pasta for those who are interested. Another health helpful option is the grilled chicken parmesan that you can get over vegetables if you care too.  I had one of the new dinners Steak Gorgonzola where I swapped out the pasta for spaghetti squash ($13.99). This dish was richly flavored and delicious. The steak was seasoned and was butter knife tender. The sauce was delicious and flavorful. The dish was made with fresh spinach and sundries tomatoes and gorgonzola cheese.   I'm a big fan of the spacious comfortable dog friendly patio and enjoy the live music that plays on the weekend. I've always found the service friendly and warm and efficient.  Tag's offers DEEP discounts. You can get $25 extra on a $100. gift card purchase and they also have a Swipe Card that gives you additional savings.  This is a family friendly kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"So this was our first time at this place. Unfortunately I will never be coming back. Service was extremely slow (it took over 45 minutes) and the quality of the food was poor.  We asked for the manager she came over after 10 minutes as the food was arriving. The food was cold. We explained this and she said she would investigate but never returned. We had to ask for her to come back. Anyway, the point is food was not good and service was worse."}
{"text":"The pizza I ordered was a large w pepperoni   Tastes very salty and a lot of garlic. Something didnt taste right . I could've gotten a better pizza from the frozen section at the grocery store   Service was great, waiter was very attentive and checked on us many times to see if we needed anything"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch with family today.  Wasn't impressed and after going to the one on 83rd and Bell which was a much better experience.  Arrived and was seated by host.  Drinks brought out quickly, ordered the mussels in rusted garlic sauce, Cesar salad, rigatoni alla diavolo, my wife ordered the mussels in alfredo sauce.  I ordered a childs pizza for my son.  Had to ask for bread which is usually not requested in Italian restaurants.  Server Mary brought bread when requested but with no butter, brought salad and never offered Parmesan cheese.  Food came out and compared to the 83rd Ave location it was bland and my son's pizza looked like they had someone training for the first day.  The thing wasn't even round.  Nonetheless I will be returning to that location.  The place was stuffy too."}
{"text":"I went to this place for dinner this past week with my family.  I ordered the sausage rigatoni and my wife ordered the seafood angel hair pasta.  We also had the mussels in rustic roma sauce which was amazing!  The experience was great and the service was also very good.  I would be returning as I actually enjoyed this place vs. other Italian places I've been to.  I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I don't give out a lot of five stars, however wife and I had a very delightful experience. We have been meaning to visit this place for years, and we finally did. This place is a lot larger than it looks from the outside. So we didn't have to wait to be seated at all. They have this place decorated as if you were eating outside. Service was very prompt, and very friendly. I ordered the chicken parmesan. Spaghetti was good, sauce is not running like a lot of restaurants. Sauce is very good. The chicken was very thick, juicy, and crispy. Just plain out good. Wife had the baked zitti, and enjoyed it very much. Prices were very reasonable. We had a great time, and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have to say that I don't understand all these bad reviews. I work right by the Original location in the strip mall by Garcias. I have been here many times and I think it's some of the best Italian I have had. I wouldn't dream of walking into an Olive Garden with this place near by. Not one person I have ever taken there has complained and most have really enjoyed it.  I have to wonder about some of these reviews. I can't help but think they have other interests when reviewing..."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner of salad, ravioli, a nice glass of wine. Bonus; free birthday dessert !"}
{"text":"This was the worst Italian food I have ever tasted! The Cesar salad tasted like tuna, for our entree we had the mamas which is chicken parm,lasagna,and fettuccine alfredo... the chicken parm was burnt and seems as it came out of a freezer box the lasagna was super dry and the fettuccine had no flavor. I came home and immediately felt sick!!! Don't go unless you have tums handy. Worst date night"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Food is mouth watering superb. My mouth is watering while I write this review. Good service too! I can hardly wait to drinch my taste buds again."}
{"text":"We had eaten at Tagliani's years ago and was very impressed. Went back today for our anniversary. We were  disappointed. Service was ok, waitress never asked if there was more she could do, never asked if we wanted dessert. Marinara sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce. Entrees were just not great.  Wedge salad was good, large glass of wine at happy hour prices. We wont recommend to our friends and we will not return."}
{"text":"We love this place!  My wife and I have been eating here since they opened nearly 20 years ago, and it is one of our favorite places.  The service is outstanding, the food is outstanding, and the prices are quite reasonable.  I love their pasta tagliani and pasta diavolo, and their pasta bowls are really good too!"}
{"text":"Mangia bene, vivi felice   Today, I decided to revisit Cucina Tagliani.  I have to say, we thoroughly enjoyed our dining expeirence at Cucina Tagliani, as we have so many times in the past.   Cucina Tagliani has two locations. One in Peoria and one in Glendale.  The atmosphere in both restaurants is inviting and reminds me of trips to Italy.   The menu at Cucina Tagliani offers a  variety of selections and prices to accommodate all budgets.  Our server was well versed with the menu specials, offered suggestions, and was very attentive without being intrusive.   I tend to stay with the standard Italian fare and Cucina Tagliani never disappoints.  Today, I choose the baked zita and my entrée was absolute perfection. In additon, to amazing tasting entrée's Cucina Tagliani's has an impressive listing of wines to accomdate your meal.  The service at Cucina Tagliani's is first rate, and the atmosphere is pleasant.  We will definitely dine at Cucina Tagliani again. I would recommend Cucina Tagliani's to anyone."}
{"text":"3 1/2* Cucina Tagliani Italian Happy Hour Fun appetizers like chicken wings w/onion rings Good Caesar salad Nice spicy rigatoni, baked zita, capelllini & pasta Tagliani pastas Killer spumoni desserts; also, bread pudding & cheesecake Fantastic food service by Christy; she is wonderful"}
{"text":"I went in expecting a very nice Italian dinner, and the food was trying too hard to not have any flavor. I will never go back here again because it was worse than the nastiest Olive Garden in town!"}
{"text":"Good food, good value, generally good service - this only lacks the 4th star because I feel the food could use just a tiny flavor boost.  It's very good, but not quite excellent.    There are lots of wonderful options, generous portions and unusual items (you can get things like spaghetti squash or tortellini as a base in mix-n-match pasta, and you can toss on any variety of toppings).  It's definitely fresher and more authentic than the standard salad-n-breadsticks chain, and features lots of healthy options.  The atmosphere is cozy and cute, although slightly chain-y.  Overall, a great place to try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food at this location has gone way down hill and the service is terrible! Go to the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"Stay away from here! The manager was extremely rude and the waitress a complete air head. Prices have increased & the service has gone down. Don't assume someone wants a certain size, ask! The food is good but not good enough to put up with all the other BS."}
{"text":"excellent locally owned italian restaurant .  great atmosphere .  I had veal parmesan and my wife had soup and salad .  ok meals were really good and satisfying .  we will definitely return during our next visit in the area ."}
{"text":"It's almost as if Cucina Tagliani doesn't even exist. Despite its visible location right off the Loop 101 freeway, I've never seen a wait. To some that might be a good thing; in my opinion, if it's too easy it's probably not worth it. And Cucina Tagliani proves that it isn't worth it time and time again.   Lets start with first impressions: tacky and unoriginal. The whole interior is decorated to look like some small Italian village or something. Oh gee, I've never seen that look before...Oh, wait isn't that what every Italian place looks like?   The food is so-so. Nothing special at best, and downright disgusting at worst. They don't even have spaghetti and meatballs. This place fills the Italian restaurant stereotype to a tee, and then they don't offer traditional Italian fare. It just doesn't make sense.   The service is just terrible. They never have enough people to keep everything running smoothly, and the waitresses are so fake. Working in the food industry myself, I'm not the kind of customer that asks for three sides of ranch after my food is already at the table. But even if you order the simplest items, the waitresses will still treat you like they'd want nothing more than to poke your eyes out with the rolled utensils.   With this deadly combination it's no wonder Olive Garden has a 45 minute wait at any given time, and Tagliani can't even fill the dining room."}
{"text":"This was a great place to dine and and we will definitely come back here again,  Our waitress was phenomenal and just very accommodating, she was great with our kids and got their meals to them as quickly as possible infact sooner than we had expected.  The meal was very good and the portions were very large and fact we all took a doggy back home and had lunch for the next day.   The margherita was to die for!"}
{"text":"Cucina Tagliani brings a little bit of Tuscany to the valley with a fun atmosphere, patio seating, full bar, and great food.   Inside this quaint space, the Tuscan decor and Italian music piping thru the speakers as you dine sets a relaxing and romantic atmosphere.  The food is served in huge portions and is absolutely tasty. When they bring your meal they will also bring a huge bowl of Parmesan cheese to sprinkle on your dish to add some extra cheesy goodness. Start your meal with garlic bread complimented with vinegar, oil and oregano seasoning. The bread is amazing by the way - you'll think the basket is filled with too much buuuuut you'll probably ask for more.   If you order a house salad, try the creamy garlic dressing. You won't be disappointed. However, be sure to try the antipasto salad. This is a true gem of Tagliani- it has artichoke hearts and cubed cantaloupe melon in it that are little sweet surprises.   The service is prompt and friendly and they will help you put your leftovers in boxes to go. There will be leftovers. The portions are huge. Sometimes we share a meal because the food sizing is that big and we are \"healthy eaters.\"  If you have private parties, they have space for you to dine in privacy too."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review, but my experience was so disappointing I decided it was time. My husband and I are not foodies. We are normal people, but normal people expect decent food as well.   I have been to Tagliani's in the past and have really enjoyed it, but it's been a couple of years, because I don't live on the west side anymore, but we were around so my husband and I decided to visit. I was very disappointed. The quality of the food has dramatically declined and the service was mediocre. Not bad, just, no real effort.  To begin, my husband and I ordered the Calamari Fritti. It was happy hour so $0.50 was knocked off the price. Unfortunately it was really bland. It was cooked well and wasn't chewy at all, which can happen, but we had to add salt to the calamari. It came out with cocktail sauce, which I don't care for, but that's a personal preference. It also came with the house marinara, which was overly sweet and also bland. You could not see or taste any herbs in the sauce. It needed some major doctoring.   We then ordered the Mama's Plate, which contains chicken parmasean, sausage lasagna and fettuccine Alfredo. The waitress asked if we'd like to add a salad so we decided to add on an antipasto salad for $2.50. Bad choice. It came out and the first thing I noticed was there was cantaloupe on top... Which is weird. It wasn't in the description that I saw, or I would have stayed away since I'm allergic. But, since it wasn't mixed in I had my husband pull it off the top and take the lettuce that was touching it. The second thing I noticed was the elbow macaroni in the salad. That was also abnormal for an antipasto. But I ignored the warning signs and dug in, which resulted in a mouthful of red wine vinegar. It was so strong I couldn't finish it. It was pooled at the bottom of the bowl and dripping from the lettuce. Even my husband, who got the lettuce on the top, said it was too much.   So, we pushed the salad aside and waited for our entree. The fire alarm went off during this time, but just as we were standing to exit, it turned off. The manager walked by and let us know that all was good and apologized. Things happen, I get it.   Shortly after our food arrived. It was a large platter which we intended to share, which the server was aware of, however she came with the platter, one steak knife and one plate.... We asked for and extra plate and knife and moved on. She asked if we would like parmesan, which we accepted, so she shoveled a bunch of shaved parm from a bowl, onto the food.   My husband got the fettuccine alfredo on his plate first and tried it. He immediately sighed and reached for the salt. I went for the chicken parm. The chicken was cooked perfectly in the middle but the coating was super soggy and it was covered in the same disappointing marinara that accompanied the calamari. The lasagna was also covered in this marinara. And it too was bland and less than appealing. I love a good sausage lasagna for its cheesey-sausagey heartiness. But there was little to no ricotta, so we were left with sweet Italian sausage and noodles. Blahhhhh. We had leftovers. We did not take it with us. We also decided to forego the dessert.   Is the restaurant clean? Yes. Does it have a decent set up? Yes. But the good was subpar and, in the end, that's what you go to a restaurant for. I don't think I will return to this old favorite any longer."}
{"text":"Service is great, ambiance is good and the portions are huge. My only complaint is that it's expensive for lunch and there really isn't a smaller lunch option. Seems decently authentic, but no Italian bread included."}
{"text":"I've been here on 2 occasions. Once for dinner, and once for lunch. Both times have been good, quality experiences.  When we had dinner at Tagliani's it was 4 of us. I was with my family, and my brother in law raved about it. We ordered 2 appetizers, and each of us ordered an entree. We family styled the entrees and everyone ate some of everything. All of it was very good. Bread was fresh and warm.  Put it in the the \"Must do again\" category.  Went back for lunch a few days ago. Went to check-in, and low and behold, a free app! Wings and Rings! And honestly, they were the best wings I've ever had. Grilled to absolute perfection. The rings were homemade. Awesome.   I had the lunch special baked ziti. Very good.   Gf had the Eggpant Parmesian. She gave it a 3.5. I tried the spaghetti and maranara that went with it. I thought it had a very clean, and fresh flavor. Great for a maranara.  Little one had the pepperoni pizza off of the Kids' Menu. I had a couple of bites to try it, and I thought it was excellent. I'd have eaten it.  The only gripe was the bread seemed a tad dated. But, it was 3pm when we got there, and I'm sure fresh bread might be a stretch.   Overall, it was an excellent experience with great food, and good service."}
{"text":"How did they come to this? \"Tag's\" used to be one of my favorite Italian haunts back in the day. The food quality has suffered so much over the years and Im not even sure they are aware of it. I got a coupon yesterday for 20% off and figured what the hell, will be in the 'hood.  Got a baked spaghetti, and a bbq chicken stromboli.. the sauce on the spaghetti was pretty bland.. this was my \"go to\" dish before they started sucking. The meatballs were well cooked but the spaghetti itself was pretty tasteless as well. The bbq chicken stramboli was a hot mess. I'm VERY particular about chicken, especially when its precooked and hanging out.. the chicken breast was tender but very old, you could taste the fridge funk! Their bbq sauce isn't really bbq sauce, just some weird sweet goo.. no real texture to this dish, very disappointing.  I'm so disappointed with them right now Ill probably never go back. There was a time and a place when they were pretty awesome.. however since expanding they've just never been the same. Expansion sucks!"}
{"text":"Always love the food here; authentic Italian, wonderful atmosphere and great service. We found this place on a whim and now we bring all our friends here. You won't regret a visit for a lovely delicious dinner."}
{"text":"This I feel is one of the best italian eateries this side of the valley. I have been a regular here for the past five years and the lasagna is the best. I highly recommend this establishment. Great food, good prices, and the wait staff was very helpful"}
{"text":"Best Food Ever! My favorite place to eat :) I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Italian food."}
{"text":"This place was...okay. Just okay. Waitress was friendly, nice little place inside. I really have nothing else special to say - the only thing I remember was that my caesar salad was better than most caesar salad's I've had.   I really expected more out of the food - breaded mozarella, fish, artichoke dip...it was all just regular!! Probably won't come back here by choice, especially since there are a handful of other better Italian restaurants that are in the vicinity. Oh well...at least I left full."}
{"text":"I LOVE Tagliani's!!  I've been going here on a regular basis for about 8 years now.  It is the best place to come for Italian food.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and everything I've ever tried has been delicious.  My favorites would have  to be the Pompeii Pesto Chicken and the Create your Own Pasta Bowls.    The Pesto Chicken comes in a huge portion (even the half/lunch size is very big) and the chicken is always very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside with a great pesto and Parmesan flavor.    The create your own pasta has a ton of options to truly allow you to create your own dish.  I've been coming here for years and always seem to create the same one, lol.  Tortolini with tomato/fredo sauce, scallops, spinach, and mushrooms.  It's soooo creamy and perfect!    Additionally, the service is always very good.  They do get a little slow when they are busy, but what restaurant doesn't?    Overall, I wonderful restaurant that I will continue to Patron."}
{"text":"At Midway Chevrolet to pick up a repaired vehicle and happily, it was dinner time, so stopped in for our second meal at Tagliani's 59th.  I had garden salad with creamy garlic dressing and the Chicken Dynamante.  DH had garden salad with creamy garlic dressing and Chicken Marsala.    Salads were very crisp and fresh.  DH loved the dressing---I thought was good, but not the best ever.  Chicken Marsala---DH loved it and I have to say my sample from his plate was excellent.  I would say rivaled mine!  Sauce was very light and flavorful, chicken was perfectly cooked.  Chicken Dynamante---came with ziti, but kindly substituted angel hair, because I don't like \"tube pasta\".  It was really good.  Again, my chicken was also perfectly cooked, and the Pepperocini Sauce was just a \"wow\" in the mouth.  I had to poke DH to keep his fork off my plate!  Tagliani's now has two of their sauces---the Marinara and the Pepperocini---bottled and for sale.  We took one of each.  As I said, the Pepperocini Sauce is delicious, and I remember from our previous visit that I---not a huge tomato sauce lover---really liked their Marinara sauce.  I would say it is almost as good as what a friend of mine makes, and she is one of those Italia-to-the-bone cooks and knows her sauce!  And same as the first time, service exemplary!  Can't ever complain about the service here, I think!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. The waitress brought us cold stale bread and admitted it to us. Food was terrible my broccoli was frozen. So I guess they do not use fresh ingredients. The waitress kept running off before you could ask for anything. It was empty which we should have notices was a sign. Never again..."}
{"text":"Everything (service, food, ambiance, etc.) was good. Not great, but good. I would say that the food is a small step down from Olive Garden, but at a much better price. They seemed to have decent lunch specials, but nothing that we had was truly a \"stand out\" menu item. If you're looking for a relatively quick and decent Italian meal at a reasonable price point, this is a good option. However, I'd be surprised if anyone was really \"wowed\" by anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Had a big group and the waitress, Darryl, was AMAZING! She was attentive and caring and patient with everybody. One of the people in our group, (my boss), owns a restaurant and was impressed with the food and great service."}
{"text":"We moved to the area about a year ago and live less than a mile away from this place so we decided to try it. The first time was pretty good... our waitress was super friendly and communicated to us there was only one cook and that's why the garlic bread started coming out burn't in the end. No big deal, we left happy. The second time we had looked on the website and it said they were open until 9pm but apparently they close at 8pm. We walked in and waited to be seated and several people walked by us not even mentioning they were close. Super rude, we left. Tonight we had dinner there and our waitress was HORRIBLE. When we were ordering we were discussing getting the large portion of chicken alfredo would be the same price as getting two happy hour portions and you would get a soup (you only get one cup of soup even though the entree is for two people, seriously?). Get the bill and they charge you two $.59 charges for alfredo sauce and almost $4 for the tiny bit of chicken you get. Our waitress never mentioned any of this while we were having the conversation with her about what the best option would be. She was awful and never even came to check on us and we had to yell things to her as she walked by and instead of stopping to talk to us she just yelled in passing. We kept asking another waitress for things. Honestly there are way better places around here to eat with better food and where the service is much better. We won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"For many years, Cucina was a favorite place to go for Italian food, but lately it has really gone down hill. I continued to go because although it isn't great anymore, it was decent...well today was the last time.   My wife ordered soup and salad, the soup tasted like it came out of a can and the salad had a hair in it.  I ordered wheat pasta with rustic roma sauce, mushroom and asparagus. The pasta was fine but the sauce was bland...no snap to it.  The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is that the bread they bring out at the beginning of the meal is good.  I hope that Cucina gets back to their old goodness, but I'm not holding my breath."}
{"text":"I've ate here with my family many many times. The food is very good. The service is equally as good. The portions on certain platters are big."}
{"text":"The food was good and the family and I liked their selection.  Happy hour has great prices and no wait. Service was wonderful and very attentive. Definitely going go come back."}
{"text":"Came here for spring training and found this little gem.  Wired approach as you look like you are going into a sports bar, but once inside the decor is relaxed and artfully decorated like an old Italian inn.  Ordered angel hair with marinara sauce and meatballs.  My wife ordered the eggplant parmigiana.  We started with a small antipasti salad which fed both of us. The antipasti salad is wonderful with a nice vinaigrette dressing.  Olives, pepperchini, pasta, salami and more make this salad special.  The angel hair was al dente with a light but flavorful marinara.  Very sweet tomatoes and we'll seasoned.  The meatballs were smooth and tasty.  My wife described the eggplant as well cooked and flavorful.  Eggplant coated with parmigiana baked and on top of the same marinara as my angel hair.  This was a very good meal and at a reasonable cost.  All served with a nice garlic bread.  Sevice was attentive and accommodating.  You should definitely  try this one."}
{"text":"The sauce was out of a tomato sauce can, the pasta was watery. The people that sat next to us said that it was terrible. Definetely \" No es Italiano\". The bathrooms were disgusting. Definetely dissapointend \"no es authentico!\". Not authentic Italian. Im being honest, all three of us were sick to our stomach after we left. Look the way I look at it do some soul searching and read the latest reviews the customers are leaving on yelp  and they are agreeing with me. I paid my bill and left because I was kind, I dont like to offend as I earned my respect. But I am honest and I hope this place turns it around. I had high hopes because I was refered to this place but , people are telling me that \"it used to be good\". But hey fellow Italianos in the valley are the customers and they have their truthfull opinions, because in life \"all a man has is his word\"."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The food is always prepared just exactly how you'd expect. The options are great. Love coming here"}
{"text":"They have best mozzarella and calamari. Dog friendly patio  Best place for family gatherings, never feel rushed in this place! Also family owned so you don't get the big chain food crap!"}
{"text":"Always a fan. For a few reasons, but my most important one is the dog friendly patio. I like to go for a few drinks on friday with my dog Blueberry who has the entire staff wrapped up in her little paw. Always good service, and although Im an atkins dieter, they are very in tune with making sure my dietary needs are met. Just a real good vibe from everyone there and the fact that they are involved in dog adoption events and have accomodations for my cheap little fur covered date make this place kinda great for the both of us. To all the staff and Mr Sample, thank you all for being accomodating. Foods great as well. Blueberry should be the mascot for this place.  I realize now I had posted this review to the other location. Reguardless. I have not been to the other location and think a 5 star rating should be appropriate by association. Avanti!  Also, the patio on fridays evenings has a real talented young lady who is really nice to listen to and gives a real nice ambiance to the whole area."}

{"text":"Their Supreme Pizza is meal for two. The garlic bread is a wonderful free appetizer. The service has always been great. The spaghetti sauces are a bit on the plain side. It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We dined at this restaurant once and had take out once, both times the food was absolutely terrific. My wife loved the Eggplant Parmesan and I had the fettuccine, both the pasta and marinara sauce were great. The salads were very fresh and their dressings, which I think they prepare themselves, were very good. They welcome having you customize the marinara sauce with whatever you would like to add. Very comfortable dining room with nice relaxing music playing at a proper level."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Let me say we were here last week and it was much better but tonight was not good waited 40 min for an appetizer and 20 mints for drinks. The restaurant didn't appear to be that busy so I don't know what the problem was but I think I'm done with that place."}
{"text":"Overrated in my book. Not bad food, some of it was pretty good.   But, I can have much better pasta, much better to home.  The setting is very nice, though, with weathered bricks, twinkley lights and twining grape vines."}
{"text":"Tradition runs deep from pasta to music. Each order can be customized - pick a pasta (gluten free, spaghetti squash, etc) then sauce option and additions (great spicy shrimp!) took off a star for showing facility wear and tear but the food and service exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food thats affordable.  Me and my wife had the lunch special (baked spaghetti and chicken alfredo) and they were both fantastic.    We checked in via Yelp and had some yummy free appetizers too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian resturant out there! I have been going my entire life with family and now I get take out and dine in when ever I get the chance! I have had just about everything on the menu and everything is delicious! I love there happy hour , I have gone here multiple times with girlfriends and we get a bunch of appetizers and drinks and enjoy the live music they play in the bar on weekends.   Calamari here is the best I ever had! It's a guarantee order here (:   I have also gone to other location at 59th ave and bell and you will get the same service, it's smaller and older but food and service is just as amazing!!"}
{"text":"Cucina Tagliani has been my favorite Italian restaurant for years, though I do feel like there has been a dip in quality over the last year or two. Their core basics have remained the same since they were just one location on 59th Avenue, but I feel like they've really over extended their reach in an attempt to compete with Olive Garden on the next block. Too many constant little changes and gimmicks. Stick to the basics!  Their appetizer menu is extensive and delicious and they have the best caesar salad in town. However, they really shine in the \"classics\" on their menu, and that's where you should focus if you're looking to sample their best. The baked spaghetti is incredible. I recommend it with a side of sausage or meatballs, or BOTH if you're feeling famished and adventurous. The parmesan options are great and always a family favorite.   I usually recommend sitting in the bar area here if you can. The service is a bit friendlier and speedier on that side."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant. Started the meal with dipping bread and a creamy garlic salad. The rigatoni was excellent but you must like spicy food! With a cold brew it was perfect."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations a couple of times now.  I have never gotten daring with my menu selection, ordering Pasta Tagliani each time. But I have sampled other's meals and a couple of deserts. The food over almost 20 years has always been consistent.  I have always had great service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch. Takeout. Ordered the baked ziti, order of cheese bread. Everything was good. Only thing is I wish there was more sauce in the ziti, it's really good. The flavor and meat sauce is yummy. I would definitely order again but ask for a little more of this yummy sauce!"}
{"text":"Been back several times after the March 2010 review.  This weekend I was finally there with my husband.  He tried the pizza and loved it!  I got my usual 14th Street Pizza, but this time it is SPICY!  My mouth was on fire and I was coughing.  Got the attention of the waitress and told her that I have had this pizza several times and it was never spicy.  The Manager saw something wrong, and she came by to find out what she could do.  They made another pizza for me.  The second pizza was GREAT.  A little disappointed that the food was not consistent.  Sorry, need to bring it down to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Always a fan and love their food.  The 14th Street pizza is my favie but this time it tasted different.  It was good but it was not GREAT!!!  =(  The service was great."}
{"text":"I have been to different Taglianis, but this is my first visit to this location.  You can easier drive by and not notice it.  I love LOVE the 14th Street pizza here.  That is all I get when I come to Taglianis.  Our server was swamped with tables at once and she was the hostess/servers all in one.  But she still provided fast and friendly service.  She still had time to check on each table at least 3 to 4 times throughout the dining experience.    I guess I will need to try other dishes sometime soon."}
{"text":"The only redeeming thing about this location is the antipasto salad . Chicken Parm sandwich tasted like a bland frozen TV dinner- garlic bread was microwaved and limp,  super garlicky yet somehow flavorless Wait staff was overwhelmed and inattentive.  The location on 59th is worth the drive - if you are on the 101 do yourself a favor, keep on going ..."}
{"text":"Food was not authentic. Calamari looks and tastes like french fries. Build your own pasta does not have nearly enough of the extras you pay for. Service was just okay, not very friendly and a little on the slow side for a Sunday night. Ambience and desert was good... that's it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The pizza comes out fast. BBQ chicken wrap is extemely delicious. Prices are great!   Delightful ambiance makes for comfortable casual dining."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and we did so because we had a coupon from one of the many coupon sites available. We got there pretty early so there was no wait and we were seated promptly.  The waitress took our drink order and offered us an appetizer. Because we were using our coupon we were unable to take advantage of the Yelp check-in free appetizer offer that popped up on my phone after checking in. Which was fine because we were in the mood for mussels anyway. We ordered 1 pound of mussels in a garlic and white wine sauce. They arrived with a basket of garlic bread. The mussels were very tender and the sauce had just the right amount of balance between the garlic and the wine. We both started out with salads. I ordered the Caprese and hubby ordered a garden. Both were very tasty and hubby commented on how large his was. I especially appreciated how both the bowls and the forks were chilled. I ordered the Papa's Combo and it was a massive plate of food. It consisted of a very nice sized Veal Parmesan along with a big piece of Lasagna as well as two Spinach Manicottis. All three items were very good but the Veal Parmesan was my favorite. It was very tender and had just the right ratio of meat to breading. I also like how they offer you fresh Parmesan when they bring the plates to your table and don't skimp on it. Hubby was a little disappointed as they did not offer regular manicotti as that is what he had his heart set on. So he went ahead and ordered the Spinach Manicotti instead. The red sauce they serve is on the sweeter side and hubby is not a big fan of that but he enjoyed them nonetheless. Needless to say we had no room for dessert and ended up walking out with three take out containers. I'm sure we will return but next time we will know to split an entrée or forgo the appetizer and salad!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely, the service was super, and furthermore, the food was excellent.  Be hungry when you go, because there is plenty! Lasagne is delicious, not to much of anything in it, just right.  Wines are great"}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews and I'm a little confused on the negativity I had a real pleasant visit the food was to my satisfaction the service was great Elise was my waitress I have a real stressful day and needed to relax I would suggest anybody in the area looking for a little atmosphere with good food stop on by and give it a try"}
{"text":"First time for lunch and first time ordering pizza....pizza has the thin lavash style crust, which I love, young men working the lunch hour were very accommodating and friendly....have lots of lunch specials....we love coming here for dinner and now I will love coming for lunch"}
{"text":"Your grandma would have cried. I met a friend for lunch there a few days ago. One of the lunch specials caught my eye, as I like to make this dish. The Chicken Alfredo was pretty tasteless, even though the waitress added grated cheese. The pasta was literally swimming in the so-called Alfredo sauce and the chicken was hard to find. It would not have taken a 'seasoned' chef to add something to this dish. The garlic bread was awful. It certainly should not be referred to as Italian bread. The place was almost empty during the lunch time (four tables). I wonder about the dinner 'crowd'. If they keep this up, they might as well close. I am not coming back. Nonna would have been sad to have seen this misuse of the term Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. I came expecting pretty good Italian food and felt like I ate stuff out of a can. There was quite a few of us for a lunch party and I noticed a lot of people in our group hardly touched their food. Noodles drowning in oil and water. The service was good for a large group, but they should have given two servers to us. A bit much for one server to manage. Not a place I would return to."}
{"text":"An excellent Italian restaurant with two West valley locations.  Pick-A-Pasta is great and usually they have really tasty specials."}
{"text":"Kudos to the staff at Cucina Tagliani! Our group met there last night for a dinner and wine pairing extravaganza.  Must have driven by this location a thousand times and never thought twice about it. Located on Bell Road at the extremely busy intersection of 83rd, you might miss the entrance or get rear-ended trying to get into their parking lot, but a safe method is to turn on 83rd, make the first right  and backtrack to the restaurant. It is much safer.  We all had their Chicken Picatta dish and it was delicious. Not a big fan of butter, they easily substituted garlic and oil and made the dish even more desirable. I suggest they offer it as an option. First course was bruschetta and we had a choice of three, my favorite was the asparagus puree with mozarella. The chardonnay offered was exquisite, too. Then, a salad with spinach, pine nuts and feta tasted delightful, followed by the chicken picatta and a wonderful cheesecake desert.   With four wines served, I waddled out to my car and came home satisfied. I recommend that you try this wonderful restaurant, one of the few local, non-franchise choices on Bell Road!"}
{"text":"We used to really like the food here so decided to try it again, especially since we found online where kids eat free. There was a little bit of a hassle when we got the check, but ended up getting that removed. However, we were still charged for our kid's drinks when the menu specifically said they were included with the meals. The antipasto salad we got was not filled with \"meats\" as described, but rather a small portion of only pepperoni and the dressing had an unusual after taste. The alfredo sauce was real bland, chicken parmesan too thin and mainly breading. When we reached out to the manager, never heard a word back so obviously customer service isn't such a priority here. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Came here last night night with friends for dinner and the food was really good. I have gone here several times over the past years and I do think the quality has gone down a little, but the food was still good. This is a step up from the large chains, and is a decent value for the money.   The only reason for 3 stars is that the service is lacking. It took an hour to get to our food and many requests for parm cheese and drinks. Could have been a new server, but that shouldn't be an excuse."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting.  My fiancé and I went here because someone told us it was amazing - apparently they were delusional.  First off, the service was not good.  Our waiter kept disappearing for long stretches of time and when he did come around, he wouldn't stop scratching the side of his face.  We ordered and then had to wait a rather long time before our food was actually done.  I've had lots of Italian food in my life and this was not Italian.  It was some poor excuse for a knock-off cuisine.  The alfredo sauce was runny and on it's last leg, the noodles were over cooked and the bread was just nasty.  I tried out the tiramisu for the sake of review and it was just as bad.  The flavor was off, it didn't even taste like espresso and there were no lady fingers in it as with a traditional cake.  It was worse than some store bought knock-off and I honestly considered asking for a refund.  We asked the waiter and they said they make the sauce in batches and keep it for days.  I have no idea why they can't make it any fresher than that.  It was almost $40 for the two of us and not even worth a penny.  I am never coming here again and unless you have no taste buds, I advise you stay away.  You can get much better quality food at Carrabbas which is just down the street a ways."}
{"text":"1st time visit and last time.  Was not impressed with the food at all. Chicken Marsala was bland, tasteless and looked to have a few canned mushrooms in the tasteless sauce. Husband wasn't impressed with the sausage lasagna.  Wasn't very tasty.  Mother in Law had eggplant Parmesan, again the flavor just wasn't there.  Had and Orange Italian soda, tasted the soda but no flavor or cream. Service, bread and Ceasars salad were good."}
{"text":"I went here for a work party. Taglianis was able to get us a reservation for 19 but we couldn't all sit at the same table. No big deal, they had two tables next to each other.  4 didn't show so we gave up one of the tables so it didn't go to waste. However, they put us in the middle of a busy room when they had a back room that probably would have been less noisy for others trying to enjoy their Valentines dinner. I would have been upset if my date night was rained on by a large loud party. They could have organized that better for us and the people around us. The service was ok. We ordered a few appetizers to start off; onion rings and a cheese covered bread. The onion rings completely tasted like calamari! The cheese bread was delicious but, the problem is they only brought one small (to-go salad dressing size) container of marinara (again, there was 15 at our table). When we were almost done with the bread some one finally came by and I asked if we could get another little side of the marinara. She did bring us a large bowl but there was only one piece of bread left by that time so it was a big waste. One would think, with a huge party the large bowl should have been brought in the first place when we received our appetizers. I ordered lemon water which tasted dirty. The service however was good with keeping up on our drinks. I didn't notice the other end of the table, but I believe the persons serving our side came around two or three times for refills. The persons next to me ordered a Caesar salad and he couldn't hardly eat it because the dressing was very \"mayonnaise flavored and gross\". He also ordered gnocchi and said it was the worst he's ever had. It came out cold so he had to have it reheated. When he got it back it smelled like burnt rubber. He took two bites and could not eat it because it was so bad. He said it tasted like it was previously frozen. The lady sitting next to him also ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken. She was also discussed with the salad saying it tasted horrible and the grilled chicken tasted like fish. The lady sitting across from me ordered the wedge salad. The chunk of iceberg lettuce she got was practically white/transparent with the dirty stem still attached which she had to carve out of the bottom of her wedge. Her dressing was a very watered down ranch. She did not enjoy her dinner.  The guy sitting next to her ordered a buffalo burger. He said his food was great. However it is an Italian restaurant and when their non Italian food is better than their specialty, that's a problem. I ordered the goat cheese strawberry salad with grilled chicken. It was a wonderful mix of spinach, fresh strawberries, creamy goat cheese and a few other items. I did find a chocolate chip in it and the chicken also tasted like fish. I pushed most of the chicken to the side and enjoyed the rest. The chicken tasted as though it was frozen then boiled. It did not taste grilled at all and it was cold. I do not recommend the chicken (and several other items in the menu which we experienced). There were more complaints with other orders down the table as well. After I got my food, I don't remember anyone coming by to ask how it all was. I didn't want to be rude risk allowing the person paying for our dinner the opportunity to feel bad so I didn't make a fuss. I am positive not one of us will go back and eat there again."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop into Cucina Tagliani because another popular Italian restaurant nearby had a really long wait. The restaurant offers buttered garlic bread at no cost which is nice, however, it would be even better if marinara sauce or garlic butter was offered to dip. I chose to order the build your own pasta and sauce. I picked fettuccine noodles and marinara sauce. The marinara was not as bold or tomato based as I prefer, however, the food was still good. I also ordered their version of a pizookie, which you can never go wrong with. When I return, I'll try another dish and ask for more sauce with my entree."}
{"text":"We have been going to their other location on 59th Ave and Bell for many years and decided to give this location a try. Very cute decor. The food has been excellent every time we have visited. I think this locations food is much better than the 59th Ave location so that is why I am reviewing this location. Their salad and blue cheese dressing are great. I also like their veal dishes. The only reason I gave it four stars is the service can be spotty. The food is great though. You won't be disappointed in it."}
{"text":"Service has always been great, don't care for the dry bread but it's the horrible water that stands out as trying to get the customer to order a \"drink\". Out of the four of us at dinner we all agreed the water tasted like chlorine water from someone's pool. The server said it's \"filtered\". NOT a chance! We asked him if we could get the water from bartender. He replied \"it's the same\". He kept pushing ordering a $4 sparkling water or cocktail etc. We all agreed no thanks. I went up to the bar later and asked for a glass of water. What do you know? It was fine and definitely filtered. Food is alright but when the water tastes better at even In and Out or any other restaurant you know they aren't paying attention to detail. Plenty of other great Italian restaurants on Bell Rd."}
{"text":"I agree with the others.... the food is horrible.  They do their best at service, and are very nice.... but that is no reason to eat here.  Unless it is a holiday and everyplace in town is closed.... i WOULD choose it over McDonalds.  That isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Took two hours to get our food. Billing issue which took an extra one and a half hour.  Spent over three and a half hours. Finally gave us a huge bill that was totally wrong   Complained to owner but he didn't care. Finally just paid and left. Do not go here with a large party.  I understand the POS can break but don't take it out on your customers."}
{"text":"We have been here atleast a dozen times over the Last couple of years, the food is not at all like it used to be. Pasta sauce was Not good, chicken parm was Not seasoned well, the bread was soggy."}
{"text":"Meh. I'd prefer the freshness of Olive Garden. Staff was so-so, and the chicken parm I got on Papa's Platter was more like a miniature chicken frisbee. I could barely find the chicken, and when I did, it was hard. Overcooked? Or was it just sitting under a heat lamp for so long?  The atmosphere was just kind of dated, nothing special. I felt like I was in my grandma's basement with all the dim windows, boxes, and fake plants.   I wouldn't really recommend this place. I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! They take reservations and we made an early one as it gets very busy. Our table ordered the eggplant parm, chicken alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs and angel hair pasta with lemon caper sauce. All very good and can with soup or salad. The garlic bread basket was so good. Drinks were reasonable because it was still happy hour. The minestrone was just ok."}
{"text":"Well this place is interestic. I think I fell into the biggest Italian sterotype. There are fake flowers, fake vines hanging from lattice work and string lights. I think I heard the soundtrack from Lady and the Tramp.   I sat in the bar area and the server has been so nice and friendly. I received a warm basket of bread always a good choice. Garlic and herby yum. Also had Chicken Scampi which is not on the menu but they made the Shrimp scampi with chicken for me.   Ice tea: very good not bitter or old.   Menu: The menu has a decent variety of classic dishes and pizza and apps. Do not come here expecting a new take on Classic Italian. It is good for a chain concept and the food is better than the decor.   I would take this place over OG or Carabbas but not Carinos."}
{"text":"Found this place using Yelp while in Anthem, AZ.   So we (my parents and I) piled in the car and drove about 25 minutes to this place.  It was Happy Hour when when we arrived so I asked for the strongest drink on the their menu.  I had the Monsoon Madness.  It's wasn't that strong, but it was good drink.   We had appetizers - Calamari Fritti  and a Caprese Bruschetta  - Both delicious. Dinner - My dad had a Pepperoni/Pineapple Pizza, My mom had the Eggplant Parmesan and I had the Linguine and Clams in White Sauce.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I really like Tagliani's. I know it is not the best Italian food I will ever have, but it is something different than Olive Garden on the west side of town. Yummy bread served before the meal and 2 options for portion sizes really help bring me back. Their dinner sizes are huge and are served with salad or soup and their lunch portion is about half the size of dinner but still too much food at times. The chicken saltimboca has me addicted. A chicken breast rolled with fontina and prosciutto, breaded, sliced and served on a bead of pasta with a creamy marinara with chunks of tomatoes and prosciutto in it. My husband finds numerous choices to please his tomato hating palette.  They just opened a third location in Avondale."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go check this place out because I've heard great things about it. The interior was very cute and loved the music, it was very Italian. However, I was a little disappointed with the food. I got the Cesar salad to start off with and thought it tasted funny, but was then told by our server it was because there's anchovies in the dressing. That would've been nice to know ahead of time  in case someone is allergic to fish, plus I wouldn't have ordered that salad then. I didn't enjoy my steak Gorgonzola either, which I think has the anchovies in thy sauce too, because that did not taste as good as it sounded in the menu. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was terrible!  Food was okay. Nothing to write home about. Bread was cold and stale I had linguine and clam sauce small portion for price, my son had Alfredo it was okay.  Place could use a cleaning. In response to comment I had already waited 15 min for bill another 10 but waitress did not come back.  I was very frustrated and wanted to leave so we walked to the front and waited another 5.  Waitress finally came running out probably thinking we skipped out.  I did not want to spend anymore time it this place so I did not ask for manager."}
{"text":"Looks litle it would be a great place to enjoy italian food. Service good. Enjoyed Mediterrean salad . The bread was terrible surrounding sausage/ pepper onions.sandwhich. Garlic bread good. Might try restaurant again,"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite Italian restaurants in the area. I particularly like the veal picatta while my wife loves the clams with olive oil and garlic. The bread they bring is to die for."}
{"text":"Went there once and loved the chicken piccata, but had a very trying experience today.  The waitress had no clue about happy hour pricing during happy hour I guess.  I asked her if a bloody mary was a well drink, so she said she would check and be right back.  She served other tables their food and strolled over to tell me that it was.  So, I ordered one since it was happy hour and a well drink which meant the drink would cost $3 or so.  When I mentioned that she said it wasn't a well drink she didn't think.  Huh? Then I asked about beer pricing since it was happy hour, and she said a Bud Lite was $5 when it is written on the happy hour menu it is alot lower.  I handed her a happy hour menu and told her in the nicest way I could (which probably wasn't taken that way at all) that she better look and learn the happy hour pricing. My son could see I was getting frustrated with this and asked if I wanted to leave.  I did and we went.   It has been soooo many years since a server has irritated me so much that I walked out I cannot remember--maybe over 20 years ago or so.  But walk out I did here. It was a Sunday during the lunch hours, and the place was too slow for a time like that.  Maybe now I know the reason.  Place was slow, gal server was slow, didn't feel good about any of this.  Not sure if I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Good food, service and not overrated like some other places.  They were busy bit seated us quickly. Appetizers were good and so was the house salads.  Both went with fish and the portions were perfect."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. I don't love italian food to begin with but its one of the best places i have found in this area. I always order the same thing and tonight my boyfriend ordered takeout. When I tasted mine i was disappointed right away. I called the store and the man who answered the phone made no excuses, immediately took responsibility and told me  a new one would be ready soon. I told him I would have to wait to drive back and he offered me a free dessert for my trouble. The desert was HUGE and three people couldn't finish it. My new order was cooked perfectly and he also included fresh bread. This place as better then average food and well above average customer service. There arent many places that offer free things when customers aren't acting angry or upset. Give them a try, and tell them if you have any problems. You will leave happy :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good value. Lunch yesterday cost $34 for 2 people, incuding 3 glasses of wine. Good wine by the glass list. Daily happy hour starting at 2:30pm. Large portions. Free warm foccacia bread. I enjoyed the lunch 1/2 pannini and salad. Yummy ceasar salad served with chilled plate and fork. Pannini 1/2 was the size of a regular sandwich. My friend enjoyed the dinner portion build your own pasta,adding delicious meatballs and salad. Always enjoy sitting in the bar area with it's wine garden decor. Nice escape from the Arizona heat."}
{"text":"It was a nice place to eat dinner. Food was great but service was lacking. No manager came and asked about the food or service. Everyone was in the servers area laughing and giggling. Had to go get refills because of them just goofing off. Anyways the food was great just service was lacking which is why I have 4 stars instead of 5"}
{"text":"It's a really nice place. Dim lighting sets the mood, cute hostesses greet you.   I got the ravioli and spicy sausage. Very good. I'd go back, and am now kinda craving to :)"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I liked the appetizer and desserts, but I wouldn't recommend the baked spaghetti. It was not good at all."}
{"text":"A busy location. We had a 35 min wait at dinner time on a Tuesday. Service was friendly. Cheesy bread was very good and everyone from our group of 5 all liked their dinners."}
{"text":"I've been going to Tagliani's for a long time.  Here are my tips -- keep it simple and sit in the bar.  The bartenders are usually far better with a lot more personality and for whatever reason, they tend to be women.  I always order a pasta bowl.  Save your money and order a half bowl (or do the whole thing and save 1/2 for lunch tomorrow).  My favorite is the tortellini with 1/2 marinara and 1/2 pepporchini sauce and two meatballs on the side.  It's perfect.    This isn't \"to die for\" Italian food, but it's relatively cheap and it's close to me, so it's one of my regular places."}
{"text":"OMG! Chyna was the best waitress I have ever had! We went to Tagliani's because our usual waitress is out for surgery at cracker barrel.  The build your own pasta is amazing. Our waitress was awesome!"}
{"text":"Food mediocre. Service awful! Server would randomly drop off bread, Drink refills and never once asked how we were or if we needed anything. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding linguini with clams in garlic butter sauce.  It was made just right and feels like home cooking.  Very tasty garlic bread as well.  They also have many true Italian items on the menu that you wouldn't find in pseudo Italian places (e.g. Olive Garden), but some items can be pricy.  Option to customize pasta.  Service is ok, nice decor inside but it's more of a eatery than a 1st class restaurant.  I would go back when I crave for some real Italian food."}
{"text":"This is a great Italian restaurant.  I had the papa B combo(lasagna, spinach manicotti and Veal parmigian).  It was superb.  Large portions great price.  You've got to try dipping your garlic bread in olive oil and oragano.  A real Italian ambiance.  No other Italian  restaraunt compairs."}
{"text":"We like dining here as a family.  It's just an easy Italian spot if you're craving good pasta but not wanting to hit up a surrounding chain.  Very reasonably priced.  Their garlic bread is very good.  The ambiance is a bit eclectic and they have a nice patio.  On Fridays they have live music in the (small) bar but if you get a table close by you can listen.  Fun!"}
{"text":"We've stopped in a couple times to dine here and have always enjoyed our meal.  I like the fact it feels like an Olive Garden or Johnny Carino's but it's locally owned.  It has a very feel good/homey vibe.  Last night (Friday) it was very busy.  We sat close to the bar where they had live music and the musician was very good!  We were glad we'd made reservations so we didn't have to wait.  All in all, I definitely recommend it.  Their marinara sauce is sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"First time visiting Tagliani's.  Pizza supreme was very tasty, great crust. Old world Italian restaurant atmosphere. Nice service. A basket of buttery garlic toast is served with every meal, a plus. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Cute little place to have an intimate lunch with your friends. I love their garlic bread and shrimp scampi. The customer service is not consistent though.   *I do go there once every few months"}
{"text":"Tagliani's is a staple for the west side and have always enjoyed coming here.  I am not sure why there are 2 locations so close together on Bell Road but why complain?  Their atmosphere is high end casual experience and usually perfect service.  I came here this weekend and I thought the bread was not as warm as usual but still good with the oil & vinegar I mix at my table.  I ordered my usual sausage lasagna which is the best thing here I think since I have only broken away a few times to find out that's all I really want to eat here.  I also ordered a balsamic side salad for the first time and this was fantastic, very sweet and flavorful.  I will get it again for sure and the lasagna was as great as usual while there and also reheated the next day.  I checked in here and received a free desert but I was so stuffed that I didn't even get it....guess I will have to come back soon."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we really liked it. The bread is delish.....!! My chicken parmesean was good and hubby's  meatball sandwich was good. Prices are reasonable.  The atmosphere is very nice and cozy . We will return with family and friends. Thank you"}
{"text":"I come here often as I live close and am not a fan of chain restaurants, which is basically what the West Valley is filled with. The service here is usually pretty good and everybody is friendly.   After years of eating here, some of my favorites are:  Fried Zucchini Minestrone Baked Spaghetti/Spaghetti Squash Lasagna BYO Pasta with Tomato Fredo sauce  I have never ordered a sandwich here and am not a huge fan of their pizzas, but to each their own!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and years. And it has changed..Alot. not sure if it's in the right direction. We went there for my birthday this past Saturday and we were a little shocked. What happened to the bread with vinegar and oil? The menu? Altho the garlic bread they serve now was awesome and satisfying the menu...was not. 1 page? That's all? Now the happy hour was great.  All their speciality drinks were 3.50! Wow!!! I got an Italian dream(fru.fru. drink) and it was amazing. The waitress we had was amazing! ! I'm so horrible at remembering names but she was the only one in our section ans she was working the bar on top of being pregnant! You are a superwoman girl! Thank you!  Now the food....I'm so in different I want to love it but honestly I hated it. I got The baked spaghetti and it was so dry and hard and not as I remember it. The sauces were pretty bland too. I really hope maybe they are just going thru owner change ans will get back to how I'm remember it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have forgotten to review one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been coming in for years and I absolutely love it. I typically get the pasta plate and order a gnocchi with garlic butter and spinach which is big enough on the full for me to take home and eat for lunch the next day.  The half is good sized too, but you only take a little home then.  The atmosphere is typically friendly. (Every once in awhile you encounter a miss-hire with the wait staff. I had one waitress every time I came it. Ugh. She was just not cool but I'm hoping she just isn't there any more.)  The decor is old an Italian homey feel.  I will say I prefer this location to the newer one near the 101. Its a smaller setting, I don't feel as forgotten and my food is always hot at this location even when I do take out."}
{"text":"Less expensive food if that is what you are looking for. Happy hour has some good items but most are fried. Not that there is anything wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Like Mexican food I've always found it impossible to find my favorite Italian restaurant..  Well look no further because I found my favorite Italian place in the valley.  Funny that I live on the west side and had no idea this place existed. It's just north of Bell of 459th Ave.  Easy to miss if you're not looking for it.   Right as you walk inside it has that family Italian feel to it.  Awesome decor all around.  A bar on the right as you walk in and then the rest of the restaurant is on the inside.  Ive been here a few times and I'll tell what I've had.  The first time I had their baked spaghetti and wow.. it was tasty!  Every bite better than the next.  They also bring out fresh bread for dipping in oil and balsamic vinagar.  Makes it that much better.  My favorite dish so far..  Eggplant Parmesan. Holy..  this dish was insane.  Im not even an eggplant fan and I couldnt get enough.  the meal is definitely big enough to split for two.  however they do offer a single portion.  I highly recommend this delicious place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to frequent this restaurant a lot, but due to work schedules for both of us, we've had to cut down on our \"dinner's out\".  We felt like going out tonight, so decided to head out this way for a fun Italian dinner.    We were greeted immediately, and seated at a table.  The restaurant looked pretty full, so we were happy to get a nice table.  Our waitress, Natalie, was very friendly and attentive.  We placed our drink orders, and they were brought out fast, along with a basket of garlic bread.  They've changed their bread since the last time we were here, and it was DELICIOUS!  We hadn't eaten all day, so we downed the bread, and were licking our fingers.  I mentioned how much we enjoyed it, and they said it was changed for their anniversary, and if you preferred the old kind, they could provide that for us.  We declined, saying how wonderful the new bread was!  We both ordered pretty much the same thing...caesar salads and gnocchi dishes.  The salads were lightly dressed, I like a lot of dressing, but it had a light fresh flavor I found very refreshing.  Our gnocchi's were brought out, mine with meat sauce and meatballs, his with marinara sauce and meatballs.  We ordered the regular size, as opposed to the larger portions, and it was definitely plenty and filling.  Their meatballs are scrumptious, and we both enjoyed our meals.  I have to say, we really have missed coming here, and will try to get out this way more often.  Walking into this restaurant is very comfortable, and it helps when they have wonderful comfort food to complete the experience."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Only complaint is the service. It was loud environment and waitress was unfriendly."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian food. Nothing stood out. I'd make the drive to La Piazza or even Maggianos if I want to eat decent, homemade Italian food. The ambience was decent and the service was good but it doesn't make me want to do a repeat visit."}
{"text":"wow wow wow ...... wonderful food!!!  first time customer ......  today I ordered the build your own with spaghetti squash - olive oil / garlic - bacon - goat cheese   - being gluten free (not by choice) this was a much healthier alternative to gluten free pasta   my husband chose chicken piccata and he was very pleased with his choice   we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Since the owner offered to make it right I have improved my rating based on his interest in customer happiness, I always try to be fair."}
{"text":"the food was good considering its price range..it is not super high quality, but it is better than Olive Garden. their bread though is amazing and it is buttered with herbs and it is very soft when it comes out of the oven. the best part about this place is the atmosphere, it is super cute and there is lights every where and it is just a good place to go to for a date night. the service was good and the manager offered to take a meal off of the bill because they forgot to take off the mushrooms which was not a big deal to me, but it was nice that they offered to fix that for us. but we are not the kind of people who complain about food to get it for free so we paid for our meal any way =)"}
{"text":"called ahead and took our dogs here. they set up the outside patio for us along with many water bowls for all the pooches.   All I ate was their desert pizza cookie which was just ok. the bread they bring out as a complimentary snack was yummy though so I'm excited to try their actual food next time I go.  Nice place and friendly service."}
{"text":"Aside from the particular location of this one being terrible and really only easy for people who've been here before, I'll go off now and state I have been a big fan of Tagliani's for QUITE some time now! :)  Very different from your family owned italian restaurants, and a bit different than Buca Di Beppo and Carrabba's.   Mostly intimate style seating, with a bar as well. Beer's are served in what most use as Soda glasses? and Garlic Bread is served before your meal but no cheese or marinara or anything.  Lunch specials are great, menu has been reduced in size it seems but still all pasta's you'd expect with a great selection of sauces and drinks as well"}
{"text":"We have been ordering off the cater menu for several years to pick up for our Christmas party. I called once to place my order, but called back the next day to change the pick up time. When the man on the phone was looking for my order he couldn't find it. Luckily I called, he said there was no order so I had to place it again and I specifically told them I needed the order cold not hot. When we picked up the order, it wasn't ready and the gentleman was rude. Had to wait 20 minutes because the order was missing items and plus the order was hot. If they couldn't get my order right after calling two different times and speaking to two different people, then this tells me that there is a lack of management and training. They will no longer get my business."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.   It's a bazillion times better than Olive Garden, but still just 'meh'.  Nothing really stood out.  The bread appetizer was kind of hard like it was sitting around a while.  Ordered a bowl of pasta and it was good, but it wasn't great.    What I liked and didn't like was the same; when making sauce, it's typically on the spicy side or on the sweeter side and it was right in the middle so, it was perfect for both audiences; however, with that said, everything was kind of plain and didn't stand out.   I'll give it another chance and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Great food.   Love the build your own pasta,  my favorite sauce is the marinara!!!  Locally owned!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, so were the drinks! Italian Dream was super yummy. Our server Nick was awesome, and promptly served us and checked back on everything he gave us after about five minutes, which is great because we tend to be super picky. He also seemed to have a ton of other tables, but was still super attentive and funny kid. We got apps, salad, two entrees and two cocktails and dessert, and our bill was still barely $38. Good food and good prices, will be coming back. Girls at the front were very rude and one was on her phone and didn't care to put it away, even as we were speaking to the other host right next to her. But the quick service and delicious dishes made up for it right away. Plan on left overs, dishes are huge."}
{"text":"It's good but could use just a tad bit more flavor. Very decent food. They get 5 stars for service though. Amanda was my server & she's great!   Got free wings and onion rings for checking in, so that's a plus"}
{"text":"Giving this place only 2 stars because the meal I ordered tasted like just plain noodles. I ordered the build your own pasta and chose angel hair pasta with mushrooms and artichokes topped with \"large\" shrimp (barely had shrimps - see photo). The sauce I chose was butter caper sauce.  So my pasta came out to taste like boiled noodles. It was horrible. I asked for some sauce and she brought some mushroom sauce with big chunks of tomatoes and that made my pasta taste slightly better with a lot of added salt, but it seemed like the sauce was dirty. I did not complain much, but I did mention that the pasta tasted tasteless. I'm very upset now because my daughter paid for dinner for the first time because it was my birthday today. The dish costed $16.99+3.99=$20.98! Hopefully maybe someone will see this and refund me and I will give this place another try and rating.   My daughter got the Mama's special which included lasagna, chicken Parmesan (our favorite), and fettuccine Alfredo. The portion was huge and was $16.99 so that was a good deal. That made up for my dish and I ate some of her food. I will post my photos for you to see.   We ordered dessert for my birthday and the tiramisu was very rich.  The waitress was nice, but when I told her about the pasta being bland she said yeah the butter sauce is like that. She had said she was going to charge me $.99 extra for extra sauce. This was before I told her about the pasta. My thinking is that they should warn people order that sauce or know that it's tasteless and give another extra sauce for free.  I don't think we should pay almost $21+ for an meal that tastes like plain boiled noodles. I can boil a box of noodles for a few bucks myself.   Update: Kelly responded quickly and I will be able to return to try something else. Will post my outcome when I go back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my husband. I ordered the angel hair pasta with meat sauce and meat balls. It was very good. My husband ordered pizza as always with only sausage and pepperoni and it came without the pepperoni. I was almost finished with my meal by the time the pizza came. My husband said it we good but it was greasier than normal. The manager apologized and took it off the bill.  We've been here many times and this was the first time the order was wrong. Still 4 stars for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We used to really like this restaurant but the food and service has gone down hill in a major way. The food is bland with exception of a strange smokey flavor, all of the \"bread\" plates on our table tonight were dirty & the service was lacking. The menu clearly notes that Monday and Tuesday, with your Tag card, kids meals are free with the purchase of an adult meal. We had 2 adult and 2 child meals & it was a chore to get this offer redeeemed. Sad, but we will no longer be patronizing this restaurant. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with tastebuds."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was very good. Started with the mussels in a garlic butter sauce and they were very good. The bread basket they brought had this MARVELOUS herb and olive oil bruschetta! The garden salad with blue cheese dressing came with fresh crumbles of blue cheese. Main course was Seafood with Angel Hair pasta, (Shrimp, scallops, sun-dried tomatoes, broccoli in lemon-caper butter), and the Mama's Combo, (lasagna, chicken parm, fettuccine alfredo). Everything was yummy. Yes, quality food takes love and time to prepare, (so if your in a rush, go to McDonalds), but service here was not \"slow\". Our server Liz was attentive and warm. Great place, tasty food, and large portion sizes. Delizioso!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to get to this intriguing restaurant for quite a while.  Well, for Valentine's day, while everyone else was jacking up their prices, they were offering a $10 off $30 through Sunday night, so we went one day early and we were NOT disappointed.  The Caprese salad and Antipasto salads were divine.  The Fritti plate which in our case meant half mozza and half zucchini was so fresh!  The mozza literally melted at the touch.  Our entrees were very good as well.  My hubs got the Papa combo which consisted of veal, lasagna and some spinach manicotti.  He said it was spectacular.  My Chicken Saltimbucca was very good but a bit dry for my taste.  I saw many other orders go out that looked very yummy so I'm going to go again and again, working my way around the menu.  The service was excellent with Barbara offering suggestions and helping in any way she could.  Now, this is not the most glamorous place on earth but it's comfortable and you feel like family!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start...  I'm trying not to gag as I write this. Anyway, my 3 girlfriends and I went to Olive Garden where there a 1.5 hour wait. I wasn't about to wait that long for less than mediocre food. So I, of course, yelped and saw this place with good reviews. When we arrived here, we were told there would be a15-20 minute wait. That's fine, we put our names down...40 minutes later we got a table. I checked in and received a free appetizer. Cool right!?...WRONG! It was awful! The appetizer was the 6 wings and 6 onion rings plate...the chicken barely had any sauce and it wasn't even cooked. The onion rings...I couldn't tell if there was onion in the breading because it was all bread! Needless to say, we barely touched it.   Onto the entree's: I got the spinach manicotti, one of the girls got the chicken Marsala, and another one got the ziti. Mine was bland, plain, and not good, at ALL. I hardly ate. My friend barely touched her chicken Marsala, she said it lacked flavor and the chicken wasn't cooked well. My other friend said her ziti was \"ok.\"  The service was ok. As we were tipping, our waitress was just standing there watching us. AWKWARD.  This place was super disappointing. Next time, we'll wait for Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere beatifully done architecture. Seats alittle hard. Lighting just right and a ambiance of italy.   Food selection moderate mid priced. A bountiful. Heaping of piping hot pasta served with a garlic cheese bread .   Service was 5 stars glass was always filled. Plates taken from table nicely a nice desert selection."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Italian and our families owned restaurants. Absolutely love this place. Nice atmosphere and perfect old-school Italian music. I had pasta with lemon caper sauce--excellent! Cannoli was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cucina Tagliani since they opened, 22 years ago and I have never had a bad experience. I had the Chicken Parmesan, despite the bad reviews on here and it was amazing! The portions are always very generous, enough to share. The bread is also very tasty. I've also had the Baked Spaghetti and the Tortellini with marinara. Both are excellent! After dinner, try the Mascarpone cake. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Food is good and I like the variety to choose from. Haven't been disappointed yet.  I don't really like this restaurant at this location. It's the atmosphere and it just feels over crowded."}
{"text":"Good Italian food and the prices are not too bad. I love my food and my boyfriend loves to get the spicy sausage. I like this location. It's nice inside with lots of booth seating. If you like Italian food you should try it! =)"}
{"text":"Our family has been a supporter of your business for years, but our visit last night was less than savory, and we feel you need to know about. We waited in the foyer for a hostess for 5 minutes, with no server in sight to possibly help us find a hostess. When a hostess finally came out, she was unapologetic and did not even greet us. She simnply sat us at a table and walked away. Our server was friendly (we forget her name), but the food came out room-temp and the french fries we ordered for our daughter were not cooked through (cold and mushy). But, we continued to eat it because we had already waited quite a bit of time. The restaurant was not busy, so we aren't sure where the problem of cold food and waiting a while came from. We will really question whether or not to come back to Cucina again, which is unfortunate. Hopefully, things will improve and we hope so!"}
{"text":"We were at EJ's AUCTION and need some thing to eat, and they are in the same shopping center, called and asked if they deliver and was told no, kind of a shame that they don't deliver to businesses in the same shopping center, to me that is a lost opportunity to there shopping center neighbors.  But I never stop thinking like a business owner.   Having a break in the auction I place an order, walked over and picked up a large cheese pizza, was about $14, but it was only a medium at best, having a tape measure on me it measured at about 12 1/2 inches. (and did not even come close to filling the box)  in my book this is a small to medium,  a large pizza would be a 16 inch pizza.  I know there is no standard in the pizza industry, but still a shame to call it large,  the taste was ok, nothing to right home about.   we also had a ring and wing,   the wings had real good flavor,  the onion rings were way to salty, and we did not finish them.  I would go back as a means of convenience, because you can only eat so many hot dogs from the hot dog cart at the auction.   LOL  I"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this spot and would take it a hundred times over the Olive Garden chain. We've been coming here for awhile and the only \"miss\" we've had with pasta was the sausage add in. It comes whole and on a side plate rather than chopped and cooked into the meal. Other than that, we have enjoyed our meals.   I will say that I ordered pizza from here once for a function and was really disappointed -- so now we just stick to the pastas, lunch sandwiches, yummy calamari appetizer.... I also really like the build-your-own pasta options, which allow you to choose your type of pasta, sauce, and toppings.  All in all, we enjoy our visits here and will surely be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is good, and the happy-hour specials are pretty good too.  My only complaint is that they make everything extra FATTENING.  I wanted to eat more, but there was soooooo much unnecessary butter and cream and oil all over everything.  I got the steak fettuccine."}
{"text":"When you would like to pull over to the side-street of life for lunch or dinner, this place has charm and great eats.  The antipasti has cantaloupe, salami and peperoncinis plus black olives married in a delicious home-style dressing.  You must try it when you go.  All of the pasta dishes I've tried have been above average, homemade and fresh.  Thin pizzas are not bad when you're on the run. I love the classic bossa-nova music playing from the 40's & 50's and italian wine garden style dining room is quaint, dark and relaxing."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktail, not what I was expecting, but was really good. Shrimp were small but it is really a good deal for the happy hour price. Calamari is a pass, I prefer the rings and legs apposed to the large big strips. Artichoke dip was very good, pita bread and toast were both tasty. I had the ravioli, meat sauce with extra ricotta cheese. It was good. My husband had the angel hair, meat sauce with meatballs. I wish I had also ordered the meatballs, they were good. Happy hour appetizer prices are really good $3-$6, I could easily order several of these and be happy."}
{"text":"Well I am disappointed to report that our most recent visit unfortunately had some negativisms. This used to be one of our favorite Italian restaurants to frequent. First, the manicotti filling was a very discolored brownish-grey which I really suspect to be a sign of old-aged food. The pasta tubes were very tough too (another indication of serving old or possibly microwaved food). The waitress was hit and miss, meaning absent when needed, and somewhat awkward and invasive when present. She even neglected to box up my wife's leftovers as requested. I guess we'll have to personally supervise that simple task in the future to ensure it gets done completely instead of believing the waitress when told it's been done (multiple boxes). The restaurant wasn't really busy at the time so I fail to see the reason for all of this. All in all, I have to say this is my most lackluster visit yet. I sure wished this was just a fluke (though the manicotti at our previous visit at the other location was nearly identical, so maybe quality is on the steady decline here). Sorry Cucina Tagliani, as much as the fond memories of great food brought me in to your abode, your quality and service sure seems to be very noticeably slipping southward recently, and consequently it may eventually drive us away. 2 stars for you, but it wouldn't take much more to push that down to 1 with my family saying adios, and exploring other Italian restaurants to fulfill our love for good food."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants until very recently. The environment is cozy and the help has always been friendly even at their busiest times. To be honest I have only had a handful of items on their menu but they are pretty damn good. Recently I have been getting angel hair pasta with capers, asparagus, Garlic butter and bacon and it really does it for me.  Recently they have changed the bread to include a flat bread which doesn't have much flavor. They also are not as diligent with offering the extra parmesan as they once were and I think it really is some of the staff.  Stars favorite has always been the baked spaghetti with extra white sauce. As a note the white sauce has chicken stock in it so again not vegetarian friendly and Star can no longer eat it.   We probably will return but are sue to be very specific with every meal we order as the mere mention of being vegetarian no longer seems to be a valid way to announce you do not want an animal product in your food.  Be sure to sign up for their member card or download the coupon from their website and save 10$ off a 30$ bill. They also have live music on the weekends which really hasn't been too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food and great \"date night\" ambiance."}
{"text":"First time here, was looking forward to a good Italian lunch. Was looking at their menu for lunch items. Never saw a menu for lunch online. When we got there there was a table tent saying there were $8.00 lunch specials like baked spaghetti etc. I had told the server that I was doing a Yelp check in and she brought complimentary wings and onion rings. They were really good. Just enough heat and crunchy, not greasy onion rings with ranch. The bread they served was delicious too. I ordered the chicken Marsala. Unfortunately I only ate the chicken. It had no flavor of Marsala wine and hardly any mushrooms. For a $15.00 lunch I expected a little more authenticity. The reason I'm giving 3 stars was for the patient server. I was with six other ladies and separate checks and she didn't mind the request one bit. One person got the pasta Tagliano and I tasted it. That was the dish to order. I will probably be back but I will order something else and write back ! Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here 7:30 reservations on a Saturday night & they were OUT of fettuccini Alfredo!  Really on a Saturday night??????  Probably won't dine there again!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a graduation. Not a bad venue, although they messed up our reservation so that sucked. I was honestly disappointed in the food. It was pricy and not all that good. Server had a big party and she did well. Get the Philly cheesesteak, super good. I didn't get that so it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Although the customer service was top notch and the atmosphere more elegant than that of Olive Garden, the food and drinks were subpar. We ordered a half loaf of garlic-cheese bread to start and were given 4 very small biscotti sized bread sticks. The actual bread that comes with the meal is far more massive and delicious than that which was ordered. For a drink I got the Tagliani Margarita that was ok but quite plain for a margarita. I was expecting a more fruity and stronger taste but the amount of ice in the drink really watered it down. Next came the cesar salad that had a sour taste dressing. I was dying to get my main dish (a big plate of raviolis with alfredo sauce) and was greatly disappointed! I was given a giant plate but with only 4 (again FOUR) raviolis that were just a bit bigger than a silver dollar coin. The rest of the plate was covered in alfredo sauce to make it look filled. I was not only shocked but very hungry. I finished my food before my fiancé even started digging into his own plate. He got the Steak Gorgonzola that tasted plain and the sauce was very soupy. He and I were not satisfied with the food and not filled one bit unfortunately."}
{"text":"It's been really hard for me to find good Italian food since moving to Phoenix but this place is the best I've found.  The food actually has flavor, the wait staff was nice and the place has a nice feel.  I go back when I can."}
{"text":"Our meals at The Cucina Tag off of 83rd were fantastic. I literally licked the Ravioli Bowl clean..."}
{"text":"Went for the mussels but sadly they were out so we decided on the clams instead... yep out of those too.  It was only 4:30pm.!!we settled for wings and an antipasta salad. It was good but not what we wanted."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. I had the baked ziti I highly recommend it. Our server James was fantastic very friendly and prompt. I would definitely recommend this location to friends and family! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food and service by a waitress which happened to be her first night! We were totally surprised by this news she was great as was the chicken piccata, lasagna and bread"}
{"text":"LOVE Tagliani's!! Try the Saltimbocca it's delicious!!! Better than Olive Garden and cheaper than Carabbas. Although carabbas is still better, imo"}
{"text":"I went to dinner here about a month ago with several ladies from work. It was one lady's birthday and she likes this place so it was her choice. Our server was pleasant enough and attentive. Our food was pretty good overall. But I feel I have to share what transpired during our visit because it completely blew me away, even as a former restaurant manager.  When our food came out, they apparently skipped the birthday girl but said it was coming right out. She ordered fish, which doesn't typically take long to prepare. I noticed while we were eating that the manager was stopping at other tables to chat but he avoided us. About 5-10 minutes later, I got up and went to find the server to ask what was taking so long. Couldn't find her but did speak with another server. Apparently this got the manager's attention and he came right over. He said he was told by the server that the birthday girl had arrived and ordered late, by manner of explanation. When we told him that wasn't the case, he told us that the server had lied to him. I could hardly believe it. It was completely unprofessional to malign a staff member in this regard. You just don't throw a crew member under the bus that way. You hold yourself accountable. Anyway, he said he would comp the fish meal, offered a lame apology and excused himself. By the time the fish dinner arrived several minutes later, the rest of us were finished with our meals. It was disappointing especially since it was her birthday. Several ladies ordered dessert, and after they arrived, the manager showed up with a huge towering plate of some kind of dessert and said it was on the house. Had we known he was going to do that, no one would have ordered dessert because that would have fed everyone at our table, about 10 of us. So most of that went to waste. While I thought my meal was very delicious and satisfying, I would likely not return due to the manager's actions and what he said about our server, I just can't get past that."}
{"text":"I came home to find my wife buried under a pile of books studying away. Neither she, nor myself wished to cook and I thought she could use a break so I set off searching the Yelp app for something new.  I came across Cucina Tagliani and the reviews seemed good so I figured what the hell.   We arrived and stood by the vacant host station for someone to assist us. The manager came by after a few minutes and seated us. Our waitress came by a short time later to take drink orders. However, since we'd made it in time for happy hour, we just ordered water while we perused the happy hour menu.  By the time she returned, we had already chosen our drinks, app, and entrees. She apologized for the slow service and said that it was due to everyone covering every position - busing, waiting, hosting duties. We weren't too bothered about it, but I was starting to get antsy when she arrived. The rest of the service was good.  Since Good Eats S. had written a review not 1 hour prior to our arrival, we used theirs as a guide. We both got the Mama's Sampler. We both agreed that the chicken and lasagna were fantastic! However, the fettucine was bland. Maybe more garlic could have brought it to life, but it was still edible. I would order the chicken parm on it's own next time since it is so good.  We ordered onion rings for our app. They were good, but not something I would expect at an Italian restaurant. I would certainly order them again, but would also like to try other items on the menu.  The garlic bread is plentiful and beats the hell out of Olive Garden's. Flavor is good, and it is cooked perfectly.  We ordered an Italian Dream and Monsoon Madness for our drinks. All I can say is that they are strong, but you don't know it until you've had one down. The alcohol sneaks up on you since they are just so fruity and good. Now I know what you're thinking - men don't drink fruity drinks. I figure who cares as long as it is good and gets you the effect you're looking for. These drinks definitely do that.  We will be coming back at some point."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner with a quiet relaxing atmosphere  Nice to be able to share conversation without distracting TV's or loud music   Food was great and Brianne was excellent!  Listened to my requests and went out of her way to make sure my dinner was served \"my way\""}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here for my birthday. I hadn't been there in years and I should of checked the menu online before I went.They re did the whole menu and made it Americanized not Authentic Italian at all. Not sure it they got new owners but the new menu is horrible. The bread tasted store bought, the food tasted okay , there was nothing special about it. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo, my sister had the baked pasta (which looked like a cake covered in cheese and was very dry) and my husband had a burger it was good but nothing exciting. So disappointed I will not be going back. I have recently had better Italian food at Carrabba's and Olive Garden Seriously save your money and go some where else."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for over 10 years! Best calamari fritti in town! And try the spicy sausage rigatoni, you won't be disappointed! And lastly, if you're trying to watch the carbs a bit, you can substitute spaghetti squash for your 'noodle' choice. It does cost a little extra, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My sis and I (and my kid) give this place 5 stars!! It was a fantastic experience!! The atmosphere was very enjoyable and relaxing!!! I love that it is not a BOX restaurant! It has lots of different areas and there is separation between booths which makes it a much more intimate experience!!!   Our server, Maddie, was outstanding!! She is an asset to the company for sure!!! She was super friendly and on top of her game!!   The food was great, from the bread, balsamic vinegar, oil and herbs to the salads (the ceasar salad is a bit \"fishy\" as they apparently use anchovies in the recipe...my sis LOVED the Ceasar salad!!) and I loved my garden salad with garlic dressing!! And then the FOOD!! I ordered  Let me set the record straight:  The marinara sauce is NOT sweet!! I read reviews say it was sweet and we asked for a sample. We were expecting sweet and it was NOT sweet!! The flavor was deep with dimension and we could taste a bit of spice. It was not bland and boring like so many other restaurants!! We ordered up and enjoyed that meal too!!"}
{"text":"Bad service and worse food. Shrimp Diablo tasted like it came out of a pouch. Worse than Olive Garden. One star for happy hour drinks which were good."}
{"text":"I am not one to write a lot of reviews, but all I got to say is this place is amazing! My boyfriend has been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and since we were over in that neck of the woods we decided to try it and all I have to say it was phenomenal! It was our first time here and we had amazing service and the food was fantastic. We went around late lunch/Early dinner time so it was not that busy, But as we started leave it was getting busier.  My family is coming out at the end of April and I cannot wait to take them here to try it! I would defiantly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at tagliani! It was a busy friday night but we were seated immediately..DANIEL was an amazing waiter! Very friendly,professional,and efficient. He kept bringing us more breadsticks along with a bowl of marinara sauce that doesn't usually come with the bread. Kept our drinks refilled and anticipated our needs before we even had to ask. The food was brought out in a very timely manner and was very tasty. Overall we had a very positive experience and plan to be back!"}
{"text":"I went with a group last night for dinner to try Cucina Tagliani and well it just wasn't my cup of tea.    I love Italian food don't get me wrong and I love big portions both of which Cucina Tagliani offers.  The service was great as well.    My problem was the food just wasn't really good.  I had the calamari which was ok and a ceaser salad which again just ok.  Then for main course i had the veal parmigiana which I thought just really lacked in flavor and thought the meat was over done.    So overall it wasn't a bad experience just lack of tasty food that led to the low rating so try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Love the Italy decor feel, nice layout. I wish I was actually there though.  Haha :))  We got the 6 wings and 6 onion rings complimentary because I checked myself into yelp. Yayyy for yelp.  The garlic bread was DELICIOUS! ( Had three basket :/ ) but it's.so.good!!!!!!!!!  The Mediterranean pizza minus the olives was awesome.  Love the thin crust. The sauce was on point. Yumm.   Boyfriend had the rigatoni spicy sausage pasta.. he absolutely enjoyed it. Everything was on par he said. He devoured the wings. He liked how the crush peppers were on the wings. He thought it was perfect :)  Our waitress wasn't too friendly nor helpful. But the food was really good and I had great company! :)"}
{"text":"Bread bread breaddddddd. Do not eat the whole basket. Haha when my entrée came out I was so full!!!!!!! Guilty.  I love this place. It's like a good feel of Italy when you're sitting there admiring the art work and decor. The people here is very generous and accommodating.  IF YOU'RE A YELPER, CHECK IN. YOU GET A COMPLIMENTARY WINGS AND ONION RINGS! whoooo score. :D I always get the vegetarian pizza with jalapeños, spinach, mushrooms and bell peppers. DELICIOUS. Love the thin crust to it. 5 STARS for meeeee!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never left a review on Yelp before but I was inspired to download the app just to warn people about this place. I wish I would have looked at reviews before I came here today. I used to make the drive from north scottsdale, all the way over to glendale just for this restaurant when I was 16 to let's say 20. I am now 30 and decided to mix things up with my girlfriend and try my favorite from when I was a kid. This place has gone down hill in a hurry. I laughed audibly out loud when I read the review previously written saying they think it changed hands. I had just done a Google search on my phone to see if they sold out. The owner must have gotten a new manager or food provider. The food made me sick. I ordered whole wheat pasta with the reduced fat marinara and it came out like a bowl of soup. We tried the 4.50 portobello mushroom appetizer and that was like a hot sponge soaked in vinager. The bread is soggy and nasty. I was embarrassed to take my girlfriend here."}
{"text":"Our fav spot for happy hour, great fresh chicken wings, clams are amazing, Riesling is absolutely delicious! Great selections on the beers'!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but remembered really loving their food. Last time we went the food wasn't as good as the first time but it was still really good. This time the quality wasn't as good but tolerable. Found out today that they use yeast extract (a from of MSG) in their delicious pepperchini(sp) sauce! Guess I'm never eating that again. Their garlic bread served before their dinner was cold. They gave us some recently baked ones but it still didn't taste very good. Almost too oily. My wife order a side chicken- said it was Bland. Mom was not thrilled with the little amount of chicken given with the salad. Their food were made in a timely matter and their pricing is recently decent. They were open to modifications and they do offer squah pasta which tasted good. Their atmosphere was nice as well.  Reply to the comment. Since I was a very big fan of the pepperchini sauce I wanted to buy a jar of it. There was a jar with the ingredient label in the bakery fridge at the entrance. On that label, it stated that there was yeast extract. I don't just randomly put stuff in my reviews as I understand false information can hurt a business. I wouldn't see why you would cook it one way and sell it another. Chances are the low sodium no MSG base contains some form of free glutamic acid. It's very very hard to find them containing without free glutamic acid. I do find it encouraging that you guys make your chicken broth..just don't add that base..."}
{"text":"When I lived in Peoria I used to eat here a lot. I really enjoyed their breadsticks and their salad. I usually get spaghetti with marinara sauce.  The service is always been good. I especially like the decor of the north west side of the restaurant.  They have a yelp check in special for free onion rings and wings. I wasn't too impressed with the onion rings, but the wings were surprisingly delicious. Now that I live in Chandler I don't get to eat here as often but when I come to the Westside I like it here."}
{"text":"I was excited to try new Italian food in my area. I've lived here a while but never thought to try this place.   I wanted some spicy Italian food and was excited to try the Spicy! Chicken Dynamite. The host on the phone when I called in the order suggested I try the sauce half with Alfredo to cut down the spiciness.  When I got my food it was lukewarm (They told me 15-20 and I was there in 20 minutes so maybe my fault). The noodles were a little overdone and could have used less time in the water. The sauce was almost completely flavorless despite being half Alfredo. The spice was a bit lacking but I did do half and half. The chicken was not good, it wasn't overdone but barely seasoned and lacking in quantity.  The bread that came with it had a pretty good flavor but was so chewy I had to tear it off with my teeth.   The whole dish was something I'd expect from Fazolis (If you remember them haha). Cheap fast food Italian, not a $16 meal from a seemingly fancy restaurant.  Unfortunately I am sorely disappointed. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because it was edible and not gross, just seriously lacking flavor. A little salt and garlic spruced it up but it was still bland.   Next time, I'll order takeout from Oreganos down the street. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had dinner in the bar area..atmosphere of the restaurant is enjoyable.  We have been here a couple of times and for some reason the service is slow even if the restaurant is dead??  Food was good. We did notice the hostess at the front pulling up her skirt and itching Her private area non stop... it got to a point where she was looking around to see if people where noticing !!!! My whole family noticed it... maybe she should take time off to clear up her issue.  Nice restaurant as long as they make sure they hire dedicated and respectable staff."}
{"text":"OK. So its a good restaurant, but the only reason I come is for the baked spaghetti. I always order a large portion and love it! However, as of today you can't get large anymore. Just 1/2 size orders. Not willing to pay $22 for what used to be $16. They also have zero microbrews on tap and their seasonal beer is PBR...really?   Now I have to look elsewhere for baked spaghetti."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  Great Caesar salad, and the only dinner I get anymore is Mama's Favorite (lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo, and Chicken Parm.  But really, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"We were visiting relatives on our trip from the Midwest. We were looking for Italian. The reviews for this were fair but it was convenient for us. My wife ordered the baked ziti - the sauce was very creamy and cheesy. Very good. I had the make your own pasta. Marina sauce with sun dried tomatoes and olives. It was great! We used the yelp app to check in and got free wings and onion rings as an appetizer- they were very good. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere was traditional and very nice. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Kelly is awesome and Alice is one of the best servers around.   Always takes great care of her people.  We are here once a week!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for maybe ten years.  Great place that still serves bread with dinner.  Not just ordinary bread but fantastic bread. Everything in the menu is great and it's a place to go and eat when your alone or have a date. Prices are good and the staff are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Always solid Italian food. I've never waited for a seat  and the food comes out fast. The bread is flavored right and comes to the table warm and soft. I love the build your own pasta plates! If you aren't counting calories finish it off with their Tiramisu because it's delicious"}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on Check Please Arizona, I was so excited to go here.. The inside of the restaurant is very nice looking but the food was not good! We ordered a chicken caesar salad it was so bland we sent it back. Our main dishes were nothing special and the tiramisu is also tasteless. I was pretty disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based off the food. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with service or the food at this restaurant. I ordered Veal Picatta and it is was tasteless, the veal was not cooked properly the sauce was way over powered by lemon flavor. I had to put whole bunch of red prepped flakes and black pepper to actually taste the food otherwise it was completely tasteless. Service was sub par our waitress not once bothered to ask us how our food was and came only once for drink refills. We choose to try this place out in place of Oreganos just down the street, we will not makes this mistake again and stick with Oreganos."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times. Food is five star, service can be 3-5 stars, thus the 4 star rating. Nice ambience but seems like music is forever stuck on Dean Martin.  But this is generally my first choice for italian in town (as well as Anzio's). I appreciate the low-carb options of build your own pasta - my standard fare is spaghetti squash with meat sauce, artichoke hearts, and spicy sausage. Often enough to bring some home, especially after indulging in the bottomless garlic bread (not low carb). Calamari is a great starter too. My wife likes the chicken parm, veal marsala, or the salmon."}
{"text":"Have always had good service and great food here. My GF likes booths and they have always been happy about showing us to one. Love the pepperocinni pasta sauce!!  Great flavor and spiciness that sneaks up on you. Have never had a problem with the servers and they seem happy to help even if busy. My GF once had a pasta that was not correct and the server was right on it and had the correct dish out in 5 minutes or so. Then they gave us a free app for our next visit!  One of the few non- chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place has been here for years and I was craving the gnocchi I use to have when I came I've 20 years ago, and I wasn't disappointed.  My wife and I came at lunch and it was pretty empty which made service quick. The device was really good thank you Cucina Tagliani"}
{"text":"We have been going here for the last 20 years and like this location better than the one on 59th Ave. Last night was probably the last visit, on the new menu it states across the very top to \"ADD\" a salad is $3.25 or antipasto salad is $3.75. My daughter got the clams which were on the happy hour menu for $2.00 less than the regular price and added an antipasto salad. I had a  pasta bowl and added an antipasto salad as well. My salad came and hers did not. When our meals came, her salad came with her clams but her salad was a large antipasto salad off the regular menu and we told the girl, she just wanted to add the salad as across the top of the menu. She said when you get something from the happy hour menu, you can't add that salad. Now, this was not printed anywhere so I guess we were to assume that we had to pay $11.50 to add an antipasto salad on top of her $9.99 clams. We brought it to the attention of our waitress and she said to just eat it and she would ring up the small salad because if she took it back, they would just throw it away. When the bill came, my daughters salad was $8.50, I explained to her that the bill was wrong and she again told me that she couldn't order that salad because her meal was from the happy hour menu. I already knew that but it didn't say that anywhere! I asked to speak to the manager and he was behind a wall right behind our table and when she told him I wished to speak to him, I heard a sigh from him when she told him and he came over and proceeded to tell me the same thing the waitress told me twice. Had I been told prior, I wouldn't have ordered the salad but I guess I assumed it was OK like the waitress assumed I wanted a large antipasto salad. The manager made me more mad than the waitress since his sounds made it seem lk=ike I was bothering him, not once did he say, how can I help you. He just came over and said I'm not supposed to do this for the \"ADD\" price but just know, next time, I can't do it. Well, change the menu to state that I can't \"ADD\" a salad at the price it shows on the menu. Lori D, our waitress I seem to think should learn to ask and not assume a teenager wanted a large salad with her meal instead of the \"ADD\". I don't think we will be going back anytime soon. Just a decent meal that ended with frustration and a manager that didn't seem to care but was bothered."}
{"text":"Food is most definitely frozen and then reheated. Not fresh at all. It's like an overpriced Olive Garden but with worse food."}
{"text":"My family visits this location quite often. The food is usually quite good. However, more than once we've had an issue trying to use a coupon. Case in point, yesterday checked in on YELP and was rewarded a free onion/wing app, only to be informed by our waitress that they weren't accepting coupons that day (presumably because of Mother's Day?). As stated before, not the first time a coupon has been refused here. Not sure what the thinking is behind these decisions, but seems a bit off-putting. It's not like they're giving anything else away. Maybe change the wording on offers to exclude certain days, but seems to me a bad idea to treat customers in that manner."}
{"text":"Brandon is awesome! He knows our drinks and makes us feel like we are family. Great happy hour and food is amazing!! Saturday night and patio guitarist made this experience extra special. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good and had decent flavor. My rigatoni was a bit greasy but good. It gets three stars because for what serving sizes you got it was on the pricey side and my food was a tad bit greasy."}
{"text":"I went here for a nice lunch one afternoon. A nice lunch is NOT what I got. My food was awful. I got the lunch pasta special, which tasted just like a cheap frozen dinner. The chicken was bland and dry, and the sauce WAY OVER PRICED FOR MICROWAVE FOOD! I may go back to try something else, but I hardly write reviews. This was the worst food I have had in Phoenix yet."}
{"text":"Better Italian food at Olive Garden and that's saying a lot!   New to the area I decided to give this place a try and unfortunately it'll be the last time.   Happy hour is not happy hour, the waitress who wasn't familiar with the menu had to keep coming back and telling me all the things I couldn't get. Not a great business strategy.   Worst of all I couldn't customize my order which was shocking. You'd think if I could have a burger made my way at a fast food joint that they could customize your meal for the price you're paying here! So be careful if you are allergic or really dislike certain foods. It also worried me that the food isn't being cooked to order because of this and perhaps just frozen bulk that's reheated.   I ordered the spinach manicotti which I forced myself to finish because I felt bad for my friend who had offered to pay.    The food was lukewarm at best, not presented well and I felt ill after it all.  I won't be returning, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area to choose from."}
{"text":"I am hoping tonight's experience is an isolated event and not a trend.  This is my favorite local restaurant.  We enjoy eating here and have also ordered food for family parties.  We met friends here tonight and if it was our first time, I don't think we'd try it again.  We had reservations and were seated immediately, and it was busy, as it is usually on Friday nights.  Our waitress maybe talked to us 4 times the whole visit.  Our food took so long to arrive, we thought the order had been lost.  My veal Parmesan was overcooked and a sixth or so was too hard to cut, so I couldn't eat it.  I never had a chance to tell anyone about this issue because no one came by to check how the food was.  When someone came by to take our plates, it had been so long it seemed silly to complain, and we were having a nice visit with friends, so it was never addressed.  That being said, the rest of the food was delicious.  I will go back hoping my former wonderful experiences are the norm and that this was just a bad night."}
{"text":"Bland food.   Slow service.  Will not return.  Pasta was chewy and seemed over cooked.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at Tagliani's for many years. We have a frequent dinners card with them that awards us points.  That aside.  We never get anything fancy. Usually just their pasta bowel. You get a choice of about 10 pastas, 10 sauces, 25 added toppings. (Meat, Veg, cheese). Always get the half size. This is always more than enough and I always take half home.  The food has always been good and the service has always been good. Not great that is the reason for the 4 stars. They do serve good food and in a quantity that is for me to much to eat at one setting at a reasonable price. The decor, and music fits the Italian style. They always play Frank Sinatra songs. The seating is comfortable and you can carry on a conservation with who you are with without having to shout and now everyone knows what you are talking about. There is a lot to choose from on the menu. The only thing I wish they had would be a pasta dish with fish, shrimp, octopus, clams, mussels. I can keep wishing and hope they see this and grant my wish to me.   I will keep coming back. Give them a try.  Enjoy life!! Craig"}
{"text":"The past 2 times we were here the table was sticky - literally had to pry the salt shaker off the other evening.     Please have whomever is cleaning the tables use clean cloths and don't just brush crumbs onto the seats either.      The clams in garlic/butter are always delish!  Everything we have tried has been tasty and cooked well. They give you a decent amount of food as well. Deserts are always good, when you have the room for one!    However, on our last visit,the usually drool worthy bread was burnt.  Twice.  We ate the couple of not burned pieces and asked for a bit more to sop up the clam broth, but the entire basket that our server brought over was burned the second time.      I hope they get the bussers/servers trained a bit better on cleanliness at the front of the house.  And get the bread guy to stop burning the amazing bread!!"}
