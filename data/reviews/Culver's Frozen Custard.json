{"text":"As far as any Culver's goes, expect a higher quality of fast food. We personally love our Sun Prairie Culver's because they are very accurate with others and attentive to customers. There are also fantastic at giving back to the community."}
{"text":"Fact: i have been to way too many Culver's locations of late. But this one is as great as the rest. Perhaps even better in that is isn't overly air-conditioned and has a unique seating layout reminiscent (in a good way) of old Country Kitchens. Cozier than other locations. Great and fast service. Tasty burgers. An excellent lunch on a day out doing wedding-related things with my mom. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Great staff, food and service. 
Good variety of food to choose from. 
Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Lovely culvers! Delicious frozen custard and chicken strips. Fast service even when busy is always a nice touch. Some more organizing on how they determine who is next in line to order would be helpful as there is very little space to stand. Confusing parking lot but the food is always worth it."}
{"text":"Decent Culver's from a service perspective but the food is as great as you would expect at a Culver's.   But no tv.   I thought all Culver's had tv's."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their summer salads. They always taste good and fresh. Also, you cant go to culvers without getting cheese curds and custard. Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Always quick service. There burgers are at the top of the fast food chain. Always good. Can be busy at times."}
{"text":"Culver's, at least in Wisconsin, is a great place to grab a quick meal! They are always clean, fresh, and reasonably priced! And Sun Praire Culver's is by far the best in the area! Their staff is always on top of their game, always going above and beyond! Good people!"}
{"text":"Food always tastes great and I love that they put coupons out. Plus, the staff are always friendly and kind. The only thing that could be better would be using organic ingredients."}
{"text":"I LOVE Culver's, but my last few visits here have been horrible. The customer service is not that great. The last few times have been very disappointing! The ran a special for my job and I was not able to take advantage of it at all. Because the MANAGER misread the promotion wrong. 

Then recently, I received a horrible attitude at the drive through because I asked for 2 ketchups prior to being parked... seriously eye rolling lip smacking etc because I asked for ketchup, hat is located directly in front of you. Customer service is a lost art unless you're at chic-fil-a"}
{"text":"My same review from before still stands but I wanted to update on some recent renovations they've undergone. They bought out the business next to them and torn it down to expand their parking lot and drive thru line. Now theres no more waiting in the middle of main street to turn into the lot during peak business hours! Yipee!"}
{"text":"Culver's is a throwback to when fast food restaurants were not only fast, but also friendly and fresh. The staff goes out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. The food is high quality and fresh, although priced accordingly (a little higher than most fast food restaurants) and it's equally greasy. Still, it's a real Wisconsin experience. They even have fried cheese curds on the menu! 

Props for having Udi's gluten free buns ($1 extra)."}
