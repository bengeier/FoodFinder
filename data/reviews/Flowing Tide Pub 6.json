{"text":"The place is cool and very clean. The staff are fun and helpful. Really great pub food, good fries in a while!! I would highly recommend this amazing establishment."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Food is bomb and drinks are good prices. The atmosphere is awesome as well. Recommend it!   P.s. fyi in the comedy world....FTP stands for F**k that puto. Lol"}
{"text":"First time here at this New pub. I use to drive by the old bar it use to be all the time. It caught my eye that it had changed as we drove by so we automatically flipped around and went there. The inside was so nice I really did not expect it to be like that. We had a very nice bartender. The owner Hunter even came over introduced himself and talked to us and all the other customers as well. We couldn't decide what we wanted to eat. I ended up getting the BBQ Bourbon Pulled Pork and it was amazing. They had so many options to choose from salads burgers pastas and sandwiches. They even had breakfast as well. We'll definitely be back for that blacken chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Great food!  Just far enough from the strip to get away but close enough to get back to the chaos.   Owners are engaged and work hard to make you happy, great service.  Really clean as it's completely remodeled with a patio and good tunes.  Support local small business and check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is great! We live just around the corner and just moved to the area from So-Cal. We had been looking for a local pub where we could go occasionally for a couple drinks and some gaming that was close, inviting and had pretty good ( loose) gaming.  We found it with FT pub #6! The staff are all friendly and keep a cold drink in your hand pretty much without having to ask, yet they don't hover and ask constantly if you need anything...great girls!  The food is AWESOME, the drinks are poured well and the video poker is pretty loose...if you are into video poker this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this local pub on a whim. Way better food than you expect for a off the strip yup of bar/restaurant.  Food is great, food is awesome. A nice place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and was like, c'mon its bar food. How good could it be? It's always hard to live up to the hype, but this place has. I had the fish and chips and it was the best I've EVER had. Bleu cheese slaw was an interesting take on slaw. My son had the cream pasta. It wasn't Nora's but for a bar it was excellent. We also had the wings with a dry rub, very good as well. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Love this new pub! Friendly service and good food. Perfect place to relax! We have made this our go to casual food restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to watch the World Cup games. The breakfast was delicious and the bottomless mimosas were a plus. Definitely will return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new spot the machines are paying like crazy the staff is awesome especially Jennifer. It's super nice on the inside great atmosphere and the food is great also. This place is the total package I highly recommend it and I'm very picky."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a #GirlsTrip over Memorial Day weekend. Before we headed out, we found this place on Yelp! The waitress was awesome,  very nice and great personality. The owner came over to greet us and offered some great food suggestions. The Philly Philly is a must! We will back in July and will return again."}
{"text":"Wow! Nice spot indeed! Nice crowd. Not pushy bartending...great wings...and the drinks were great for the price. Why pay $16 drinks on the strip! Check local areas. This is a great spot.. awesome breakfast menu too."}
{"text":"Really great locals bar, very good food, awesome drinks. Whitney is the bomb.  Will return."}
{"text":"New revamped remodeled bar... (it was cozy's before) it's also been a few bars in the past but it is now flowing tide pub ....  I came there for a soft opening .... we were greeted right away all the workers tend to be nice and friendly since it's new ... it's defiantly a lot more nicer then I had been nice murals and the pool table had been moved ....   We got our cards to play you get a free 20$ once you play 50$ I believe it was....   **** they have a promo going if you hit 4 of a kind on the machine u win 1000$ I hit two four of a kind but you HAVE TO SHOW THEM or it doesn't count which I didn't get that memo so I wasn't aware so my four of a kinds didnt count****    My only negative so far is that I had to wave them down to get drinks for us because they didn't come down they were on the other side or walked past and didn't even ask since it's a new bar I'm sure they are just trying to get the hang of things"}
{"text":"Super solid for 24 hour food. Chicken and beef skewers were great. The sandwich bread had a hint of garlic that was surprisingly good. The mozzarella sticks were a bit bland, but the other food made up for it. They have a pool table and darts too."}
{"text":"A locals joint that's nicer than your average locals joint. I found it while looking for Harbor Freight and liked it so much I went back for lunch two more times before leaving town. Service is friendly, beers are cold, and the food is great. Prices aren't over-inflated like in the tourist joints.   If you're not from around here but you're in town doing the convention shuffle, pop over here after you hit Home Depot and enjoy a little downtime. It's convenient and a nice place to take a break to recharge. Or if you're visiting and looking for a place that's not overrun by bros, take a drive and have a beer here."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I would definitely come back here! We were visiting and read great reviews for here and everything mentioned is very accurate."}
{"text":"Excellent Reuben Sandwich! Great Service! Awesome Atmosphere!!! Highly recommend & will definitely return"}
{"text":"Not the biggest selection of draft beers, but they have it seems like the rotating 5 always will have a strong IPA ro two, which is always a good sign.  My double IPA ran $6.50 each which is solid for a 7+ abv pint.  The place has about 10 TVs and a patio area outside.  Good setup with tons of snaking bar seats, few tables, and then back area for darts and the like.  Service was good and very attentive.  Owner/manager for the night I went seemed to be very active in keeping the place going - bussing tables and serving, himself.  He really had his stuff in order and seemed to be very active with getting rotating beers on tap that will sell.  All in all, a nice bar if you're in the area.  Recommended for an alternative, less rowdy local bar."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying this is my new  FAVORITE bar!! The owner is so pleasant and comes around always conversing with his customers and making them feel so welcomed. That was what made me come back. Now To the best part - the happy hour!!! Their shots are always like a double shot and the prices for the food and drinks are outstanding. Everybody is always so nice and attentive; which is extremely hard to find these days. I would just like to give a shout out to all the staff and to the owner for making this bar feel like \"home away from home\" ... y'all are the real MVPS"}
{"text":"I was a frequenter at the Flowing Tide in Sparks when I lived up north, now we have one in Vegas?!?! Wonderful. I will gladly drive across town to this place just to have a little piece of Reno in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour special. I think it started at 11 on a weeknight. The chicken tacos which I thought we're going to be whatever were the best things we got. The sauce was flavorful and just amazing. Chicken wings were great. The calamari is sauced in a creamy mushroom sauce and quite nice. Caprese salad was very good. Simple fresh and delicious. I just have to say though. Chicken tacos. 5 bucks happy hour. Chicken tacos. Chicken tacos...."}
{"text":"What a phenomenal place to be at the people are super friendly the machines are loose and I just can't think of a better place to play. you guys have got to get down here! What a huge change from Fred's Tavern as I always knew it ! This new flowing tide concept is perfect in every way ! You have got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Love the vibe and super cute decor. Jen n joe are the best.  Love it here ! Great food great drinks. I will def come back !"}
{"text":"Stopped in while on vacation from Reno Nv and happen to drive by. Met Joe the bartender for breakfast. Great guy, very personable and being flowing tide came from Reno he was exited for Flowing tides future in Vegas. Let us know a little about vegas and the changes he has seen over the years. Was a great experience and we plan on stopping in a few more times during our stay. Thank you and Congrats on the upcoming wedding Joe."}
{"text":"The old Cozy's bar has been remodeled and now is The Flowing Tide Pub. What a massive improvement and updated remodel. The food is delicious. It's not your typical bar food. It's restaurant quality. Highly recommend the tide burger and tater tots. Chicken tacos are also dope. Welcome to the neighborhood flowing tide. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  I had the Ahi Salad; it was fabulous. My husband had a burger and fries. The fries were outstanding and the burger was good too!  I'm coming back just for fries."}
{"text":"This place was great. Really friendly service, tons of beers on tap, sports everywhere, and the burgers were delicious and reasonably priced. Well worth the extra effort to get away from the strip and main tourist areas."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Awesome patio! We had the Penne Pasta and steak sandwich, portions are large. Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I think we have found our new local pub!!!  The Flowing Tide is the newly remodeled Cozy's Tavern and we LOVE the remodel, new owners and their staff.  The bar has a great atmosphere.....it is a nautical theme with cool murals and portholes.  There is plenty of bar space, TV's, machines and a nice view of the strip too. We have been several times since their opening in February and each time the service has been awesome. They have a full menu, good prices and gluten free options as well.  They also have no problem granting special requests either...I asked if they would substitute Turkey for the Corned Beef on their Rueben Sandwich, it was no problem at all and it was delicious!!  We have also tried the Fish & Chips, Breakfast Burrito, Eggs Benedict and their Broccoli Tots and all of the food has been great.  They have a good selection of beer and alcohol too....Make sure to ask the bartenders to make one of their specialty drinks  - Walk The Plank is a whiskey drink, and my favorite, Shipwrecked is served in a cool Fish Bowl or try their blended drink called the Rip Tide!!  They are all Delish!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met some friends for game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals last night, and it was a full house. I feel like they were a little understaffed for a holiday and a big game, and the manager was out helping the waitress. They were very attentive nonetheless. The quality of the food was top notch. I got the cioppino which was one of the best tasting ciappinos that I've had and for half the price of what most restaurants charge for it. Our table also won a couple of FTP shirts from a raffle. We had a great time."}
{"text":"We ordered through Doordash and our food was packaged well, delicious and arrived hot."}
{"text":"I went about a week ago, the service was great and the sliders are really good. Awesome mb e strip view."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The food is excellent, they have incredible views of the Vegas Strip, have great service, and a solid beer selection. They also have all kinds of great nautical themed drinks and a great interior design scheme that gives it a boat like feel. The owner will make sure guests have a great time! The Dip sandwich is really good and keeps me coming back whenever I have a craving!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing special, just bar food. Reviews are too high. Chicken strips were pretty much gas station variety. Broccoli bites were very over cooked. Fries were good, though."}
{"text":"Penna Pasta zucchini  noodles were amazing ! Service was friendly and drinks are great"}
{"text":"This is a great new bar/restaurant in town! The food is much better than most bars and the remodel they did looks amazing! Definitely one of the better new spots to open recently. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I came here once with my boyfriend, had some drinks and played some pool! Came back the next week with my family for dinner and drinks and had a fantastic time! We had two children with us so we sat outside on the couches/patio area and were able to watch Hockey. The view is a little hyped up, but overall you can't beat the prices and the friendliness! The staff was super friendly and  the food was good!   We will definitely be going back and would strongly suggest to people in the area!"}
{"text":"Perfectly located just off strip, but close enough to be near the action. Great ambiance, I loVe the center post with rope.  The colors and the feel of your surroundings are right where they need be.    Excellent entertainment area with a pool table and game board. Lots of seating throughout entire bar.  Amazing open bar and view of strip. The outdoor area is so inviting and open.  Just gorgeous on a spring, summer, fall, or winter night. They have a number of excellent cuddle sections. (At the least that's what I would use them for).    I have only lovely things to say about the menu.  Delicious!!!! My taste buds were so pleased.  The selections are wonderful and available 24 HOURS A DAY!!!!! The seating for dinning are very comfortable and perfect for that cuddle.  Great for date.    If you enjoy gambling they have you covered there too.  Bar is loaded with options and the bar they have has a pleasant selection.   Definitely worth the time."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Great service and fantastic food! I had the Penne pasta with chicken....soooo goood! And the garlic toast was best I've had! Co-owner, Hunter, greeted us while we were there. Nice young man. Very friendly."}
