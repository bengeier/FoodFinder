{"text":"My son and I have eaten here twice, once around 4:30pm and once around 1:30pm, and both times the place was empty. We were surprised because we were happy with our food and the service. The restaurant is clean and pleasant with the Mexican music playing in the background. This is a great place to have a flavorful, quick meal inexpensively.  Great alternative to fast food chain restaurants!!"}
{"text":"How does this place have so many stars?

The chips weren't good and tasted stale. The salsa was watery. Our entrees were totally bland.  Even the service was a little \"off\" and we went on a Friday night. 

Heck, my wife dang near needed a chainsaw to get through her enchilada.

While I love to give places a chance and sometimes a \"second shot,\" this place is an instant \"one and done-er\" in my book.  

I hate to \"blast\" a place, but in my opinion, go to Delmont if you're looking for good, Mexican food. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed and unfulfilled."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood Mexican Eatery. The food is well prepared, served quickly and doesn't break the bank. Nothing too exotic here, just the usual Mexican restaurant favorites. Our lunch was just what we wanted it to be. 

It's a brand new place, so new in fact, that it still smells vaguely like fresh paint.  Because it's so new, they are still working out a couple bugs. No Iced Tea or Coffee the day we were there. Not a disaster. Something I'm certain they'll fix in short order.

Will we go back? Absolutely."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant off of 22 in Murraysville/Monroeville area.  After driving past several times, we were intrigued enough to finally stop in.

The restaurant is typical American Mexican in decor and menu.  No bells and whistles, but they aren't needed.  It is BYOB, so don't go expecting to order a margarita.

The menu is pretty typical.  Individual items along with a variety of combinations.  They also have smaller side portions.  

You get the standard chips and salsa with your meal.  If you want an add on, their queso is pretty tasty.  

Service was speedy and efficient.  

Overall, a nice place for a quick and inexpensive Mexican meal, but nothing really stands out as being exceptional."}
{"text":"Great addition to Murrysville.  Food is good, big servings and low prices.  No alcohol so you have to bring your own if you want.  We've eaten there 3 or 4 times ordering different things each time and have not been disappointed yet.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and son here the other day around 3 or 4 pm and the restaurant was empty when we arrived and no other patrons came in the entire time we were there.  If that wasn't a huge hint to turn around and walk back out the fact that they employees saw us arrive and we still stood, waiting to be seated a few minutes before they showed us to a table should of been.  The food might be authentic but I found it to be extremely bland.  My wife can't have a great deal of processed foods usually loves authentic and simple cuisine but even she was unimpressed.   Maybe they are just working out a few kinks but I'd rather travel a bit for better Mexican food or just find something else locally."}
