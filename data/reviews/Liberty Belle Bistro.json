{"text":"I love this place - the steak tartare is excellent, as are the frites, plus they have delicious specials and Mill St beers on tap.
A very short menu, which I generally prefer as it means the kitchen is focusing on stuff they know they can do a great job on.
The wait staff is very friendly, as is the owner, who frequently stops in at tables to check that everyone's happy."}
{"text":"Went in for a casual sunday morning brunch and we were absolutely blown away! 
We began with the fresh squeezed pear juice and exquisite fluffy cappucinos. My eggs benny with avocado were creamy, delicious and perfectly prepared. My fiance shared a bite of his maple cured omlette with creme fraiche and I thought it couldn't get any better... until our french toast cinnamon bun proved me wrong! Topping if off with a fresh strawberry and orange mamosa, we were in brunch heaven. 
Service was a 10. Atmosphere beautiful, comfortable and intriguing!
We can't wait to go back to try their dinner menu :)"}
{"text":"I bought the vouchers for this place a few months back after seeing the positive reviews on it somewhere online.

Last night my husband and I finally decide to use 1 of the 2 vouchers ($25 for $60) that we bought to try out this place, after work, on a super hot & humid Friday evening.

We live not too far away in the downtown core and coming here was only a simple streetcar ride, and so we didn't experience parking dilemmas.

Since it was super hot out, we were desperate to cool down and asked for seats inside.

This is a cute, cozy and casual place.

Decor: old-fashion home feel with a small dining room that will seat 30 at most. Yet, everything from the floor to the tables, chairs all look clean and well kept. Each table had it's own different pair of animal salt and pepper shakers which was really cute too. My seat didn't face the back but I remember from short glances that behind the dining are the Specials written on a chalkboard next to the bar/cash area, then pass that it's a kitchen area and you can even see the chef doing his work through a window. Patio in front is partially on a platform and looks quiet and shady. However, we opted for inside as it was still very humid last night. A small group of 8 end up taking the space later on during our meal. The washroom in the basement was nice and clean. Hallway and washroom floors were covered with small black and white tiles and the bathroom stall doors were the cutest/fanciest stall doors I've ever seen. I think it got patterns that was either carved or painted on, with little purple velvet curtains too. Oh yeah, I also saw what's probably an antique scale in the hallway, which is not something you see everyday outside of a restaurant's washroom :) I didn't try it but I assume it still works :)

Anyhow, the most important part, the food.

We end up ordering 3 entrees to share, as we liked the sound of the specials and the menu items and can't just settle on 2.

We got from the specials menu: 1) flat iron steak and 2) swordfish and from 3) crispy game hen from the regular menu

Everything was delicious. All the meats were cooked to perfection; all moist and kept their natural flavors. Swordfish may be 'fishier' than some other fishes (I normally like fish but this was my first time trying swordfish) but I guess that's just the natural taste. Crispy game hen was definitely crispy, juicy and flavorful. It was also served flat with only a little leg bone, so very convenient to eat. I ordered the flat iron steak medium rare and it did came out so, with just the right amount of dry spice on top. Not only were the main items done well, but all the side vegetables were cooked with care as well; taro chips with the steak, asparagus, fingerling potatoes and other greens that I didn't know the name of. 

Overall, I enjoyed everything; the meats, veggies and sauces, though simple and light, all were tasty and done with care.

To go with the food, we wanted something non-alcoholic and ordered cold ginger beer and black cherry soda in glass bottles. Very refreshing.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention the bread at the beginning of the meal. Small rolls, fresh, not sure what kind it was, but was very good. Served on a crystal plate with butter and this special pesto/spread. Not sure exact ingredient but I think bit garlicky and spicy. Very unique and good. I end up eating husband's share when he saw I liked them a lot :)

Service was excellent as well. It wasn't too busy as dinner hour just started and there were only 2 couples including ourselves. There was only 1 server at the time, who was casual and friendly. Another friendly guy came out and asked how we liked our food as well, and I think he was the same guy I briefly saw through the kitchen window cooking.

The only down side is that the portions are not very big. We did order 3 entrees and shared them equally. I was ok at the end but my husband was still hungry. I think in most cases, 2 people ordering 2 entrees would leave this place still hungry :)

We had an enjoyable dinner, left a 20% tip and I definitely look forward to coming back to use my 2nd voucher. I like the quiet, casual and tidy atmosphere, along with excellent foods and service."}
{"text":"This place was DELICIOUS!!!

A mom friend and I stopped here after a stroller-fit workout to grab a bite and ruin the hour of squats we did. Let me tell you it was worth it!

My friend ordered the parsnip soup and lamb burger while I decided on the smoked salmon and dill creme fraiche over the pulled pork. WHY I do this to myself I'll never understand. Salmon vs Pork??? PORK WINS!

But the salmon was pretty tasty - but I'm not going to lie I suffered from some serious food regret. 

We also had some freshly made juice which I want to say was pear and ginger...but I really can't remember - it was good either way. 

Plus bonus to moms - they have a nice spot on the patio where you can pull up your strollers. Even my mom friend's gigantic jogging stroller fit nicely alongside mine and the server was still able to get around us, and didn't get weirded out once we had to breastfeed. Although he did advert his eyes and stumble over the steps which I thought was pretty funny. 

Anyway - this is a fantastic addition to Liberty Village and I only wish they had opened up while I was still working in the area."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 10 people for my friend's birthday, we had 2 vouchers. They were extremely nice from beginning to end but that is not where the problems began.

We arrived at 6:30pm hoping to finish dinner by 8:30 (2 hours) and head over to Horseshoe Tavern for Die Mannequin's concert. We got our appetizers about 1/2 hour after ordering. By 8:30pm our entrees was just arriving, we waited for over an hour and a half after ordering for our food. With the exception of one friend's dish which came out almost 30 seconds after ordering and which he said was cold. The bread was yummy tho with this spread that come with, which is what most of us used to keep us going.

We were all hungry and not in the mood for small and quaint French food. The flavors was okay, I had the mushroom risotto and it was maybe 6 bites and not filling. My husband liked the harder texture like he likes his pasta but for me it was just under cooked, which was upsetting since they had 1 1/2 hr to cook it. My friends had the steak and frites which was really yummy but a much smaller portion then they were thinking of for $28.

My husband has the salmon and 3 spears of asparagus. which was laughable at that point because he's a big boy and very hungry by that point. the salmon was cooked nicely tho and not dry at all. We shared a bottle of wine, the serve/bartender recommended a white which was really great. 

Lastly they have macaroons in this jar at the bar which i was staring down the whole meal and OMG they are $2 a pop and yummy yummy yummy.  I had the pistachio and the burnt orange. 

The icky parts: The chef, waiter and another waitress all came by the table at one point or another to fill water or bring the appetizers and bread. At no point in the 1 1/2 hour we were there waiting did anyone come by to say the food might just take a while or apologize for making us wait an absurd 2 hours from when we stepped into the restaurant to our entrees. Only near the 2 hour mark when I was going to make a comment did the waiter hurried over and said it will just be a few minutes. 

At this point 3 peoples parking has expired and some went outside to parking enforcement officers gawking at their cars waiting for the exact minute the time expired to write them all tickets, a couple managed to get tickets in time but sadly my sister got a ticket exactly 1 minute pass the time. We went back inside kind of upset that this dinner is not only costing us so much time but also now a $35 ticket. When we get in the owner/waiter exclaims ohhh they got you? and then very \"kindly\" mentions at this point that this is an every day thing on their small street?!?!? Why would you not mention this earlier??? Their restaurant only has about 10-12 tables. They know we have been waiting for 2 hours and didn't think to mention that their patrons frequently get issued tickets. I find that disappointing and definitely a negative to come here, to always be watching the clock because the food is slow and the parking enforcement seem to have it out for them.

After we paid our bills and went outside to get to the concert, the stupid officers were there AGAIN less than 30 minutes since the last time. Really irritated at this point...

When we finally arrive at the Horshshoe we are told they have reached their capacity =( 

Thanks Liberty Belle Bistro, but seriously No Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. So much. So much I hesitated to tell you all about it because I don't want to have to wait in line!

But I had to share - this fledgling restaurant has only been open about 7  months and I want them to succeed. 

First plus - its French. As you'll come to learn in any of my reviews, I love French food. The menu is small and perfect - they specialize in local ingredients, reasonable proportions, they have a pastry chef making their breads and desserts, they have a delicious brunch menu. Good coffee, great service and the most delicious salad that seems so simple but is amazing, I can't say enough about it. It has vegetarian (pescatarian) friendly food which is important to me as well.

The down side? I can't figure out when they're open! They seem closed every time I go by - I tried to make 8pm dinner reservations on their answering machine that told me they were open Saturday nights but when we walked by they weren't. They closed down for the August long weekend when I tried to take my mom there. II just can't seem to figure them out. 

But if you manage to get there when they're open - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my wife and must say that it was a very warm and welcoming dining experience.

Let me begin by saying that mistakes can be made by any waiter in any restaurant, no matter how fancy or how casual - the key is how the restaurant deals with the error.

In my case, I ordered the pulled pork eggs benedict, but accidentally got the pulled pork sandwich.  I didn't mind very much because the sandwich was delicious, but most importantly, the waitress was extremely apologetic for the mistake and offered to replace the sandwich with the correct order (this even after I'd eaten most of the sandwich).  Furthermore, the chef/owner himself came out and apologized for the error and gave us each a free experimental pear/lime mimosa for our trouble.  We got to talking with him and he seems like a genuinely nice and friendly guy who is eager to please his customers.  I happened to mention to him that I am a big coffee fan, so he brought me out a delicious espresso along with a story about the guy he buys it from.

Here I've talked all about the experience and not about the food, which was perfect.  The club sandwich my wife got had a really nice touch of blue cheese and the avocado flavour/texture really stood out.  Even the ketchup they make for the french fries is in-house - it's very tasty, a bit reminiscent of pizza sauce.

As for the ambiance in the place, it's awesome.  The details are beautifully done, from the tin ceiling to the fantastic wood work around the pass-through from the kitchen to the dining area.  Even the menus have cute french-style pictures on them.

Ultimately, this brand new bistro in Liberty Village is a star - I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My folks were in town for the weekend, and I recommended Liberty Belle because it is selfishly not very far from where I live (and everyone else could take a taxi from the hotel heheh).

So 6 of us dined at Liberty Belle that night. I ate a delicious bistro style steak, while the others had fish, pasta, and risotto. Everyone agreed the food was great. 

Aside from the food, I liked:
- casual style and cool, intimate atmosphere (no white tablecloths)
- attentive and good-humoured servers
- creative décor, especially the bathrooms (go see them!)

This little place needs some lovin', since it's on a relatively low-foot-traffic street, and doesn't have high density condos nearby (YET!). 

Very well worth it!"}
