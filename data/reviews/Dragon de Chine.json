{"text":"I usually get the Special T.V. Dinner #17. Good old Général Tao, tasty and cheap, a no brainer, direct en face Métro Verdun."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, plentiful, Montreal style \"Chinese\" take-out food. TV 17 and Poulet Honolulu are favourites."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this food.   Ordered Szecguan and every item was breaded except the rice.  I called back to complain and they quickly picked up order and sent me something else.   I told the lady that I did not want anything breaded.  She said she would compensate me by sending me chicken wings.   You guessed it they were breaded.  The 2nd order was both tasteless and colorless.  Would never order from this place again.  The ladies at the counter are very nice."}
{"text":"This was the WORST Chinese food I have ever eaten. Before eating here, even 'bad' Chinese food was still 'ok' .. But this place gave new meaning to the word bad-- which is a shame, because the ladies behind the desk are absolutely lovely.  The chow mien with chicken gave a nasty new meaning to 50 shades of grey. Grey chicken, grey vegetables, grey noodles. On top of miscellaneous brown rice. I wish it was bland... But it simply tastes old. Furthermore, I found a small brown rock in my food... Which wasn't even my least favorite bite.  How this place has survived, I will never know.  Absolutely deplorable."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place. I've been ordering from here for 7 years and would recommend the TV dinners. They're a good value for money and I have yet to be disappointed in quality. The service is quick and I also have the added benefit of seeing behaviour outside the kitchen by being their neighbor. The garbage is always neat and orderly and the staff is very respectful. Definitely a good addition to the neighborhood with fast consistent cheap eats."}
{"text":"I ordered: \" nid d'oiseau au fruits de mer\" and \"saute mélange de légumes\".   Very bland and greasy. Will not order from there anymore. I kind of regret not cooking it myself."}
{"text":"Okay so after writing my first review I revisited this restaurant a few times for take out/delivery and I have to update the original to include the following disclaimer:  What it says on the menu is not necessarily what you will receive.  I guess the definition of \"chinese\" food varies by region but having basically grown up in Chinatown Toronto, I  have a decent grasp of what's what on a chinese restaurant menu.  That being said, I ordered delivery of \"pork chow mein\" and received \"pork fried rice\".  I called to report the error and they said if I wanted the chow mein they'd send it right out but I'd have to return the \"pork fried rice\".  We found this little bit annoying because the rest of our food had arrived and was still hot and we wanted to get started, but we agreed.  We then waited 30 mins for the chow mein to arrive and make the exchange, at which point the rest of the food was cold.    When the replacement did arrive, it was not \"pork chow mein\" but \"pork chop suey\".  I called back again to let her know of the 2nd mistake, this time they said keep the chop suey and they'd credit a pork chow mein to my name/number for next time.  In their defense, the pork chop suey was quite tasty, as was the wonton soup and chicken we ordered, so it wasn't really that huge a let down in the long run.   A few weeks later I decided to cash in on the replacement pork chow mein, and also decided to order more of their (admittedly DELICIOUS) wonton soup and some chicken balls.  Even though they have both \"Chicken Balls\" and \"Pineapple chicken\" on their menu on separate lines, and at separate prices, the order taker informs me that \"chicken balls\" are the same as \"pineapple chicken\".  Okay fine, I'll take whatever you wanna call it as long as it's the balls in the red sauce junk food that I'm craving right now.    Although it was just standard red sauce and chicken balls, they were great, but \"pineapple chicken\" they were not.... and the \"pork chow mein\" they were supposed to send?  It was \"pork chop suey\" yet again.  I didn't bother calling to correct it this time.  The food was decent and the price is reasonable. I'll probably order from them again, but I will keep in mind that what you order off the menu is not necessarily what will show up when you open the box."}
{"text":"I'll review each food item I got.  Garlic ribs: too much fat and the sauce too sweet. No hint of garlic.  Chow mein: somehow there's no noodles here, just soybean sprouts. Tastes bland.  Rice: it was the worst tasting rice I've had in recent memory.  Egg rolls: they're store-bought, probably from Costco. They were the best thing, but that's not saying much.   I don't often eat out, so I try to make it something special. This was the farthest thing from it."}
{"text":"I was after 10pm, and I was in need of pre-late night dinner snack. I headed out of the Metro, and quickly checked the bus schedule. Having about 12 minutes to spare I ran over to Dragon de Chine's take-out counter.   After a quick peruse of the menu I simply ordered two egg rolls. A customer to my right was eating his soup while chatting at the counter. Then while waiting for my order another gentleman came in and ordered two egg rolls to go. I had a feeling I might be onto something good. Enough time had elapsed between ordering and its arrival that I had a feeling they would be both warm and fresh.   Handed to me in a tall, folded and stapled brown paper bag, I noted one piece of fried rice sticking to the hand written bill as I high tailed it across the street. Seemingly with enough time to spare, I tore open the bag, rested the plum sauce as best I could on the green painted wooden bench. Trying to keep the brown paper roll hand wipe (I'd been given in place of napkins) from flying away on the wind - I dipped in generously and took a healthy bite. The shell was crispy, and the filling was warm (not burning hot). It was comprised of chopped cabbage and a sort of minced meat base. Right then my brain and stomach did the, \"am-I-gonna-get-sick-from-this mind trick,\" as I moved on to a second bite. All clear. By this time the sticky sweet sauce was starting to do its thing as well (meaning get all over the place).   Soon after polishing off the first roll, the bus decided to arrive a little early. I hastily capped the open sauce, rolled up the ripped bag into a pouch and stepped on. Taking a seat near the rear with a free seat beside in which to set up the second half of snack-time.   As the bus pulled away I creatively balanced the sauce container in one hand and chewed of the end of the second egg roll. Having a few stops to go, it only took me three bites to finish and pack the remnant sauces into a ready to dispose trash packet.   My stop came, I thanked the driver, tossed my trash into the bin and walked home. Its large corner yellow neon sign displays a phone number (without area code) in the upper right corner.   This fact helping prove that people know to find a good old school egg roll, just like inherently knowing the area code must be 514.  Note: Since I only tried the egg rolls, I am just rating them, not the overall menu/ambiance."}
