{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The first time I went to Drupati's I tried the curry goat, which was good. Second time was the Roti, decent size, not greasy and the hot sauce kicked my ass.  -sidenote- the doubles are kickass, brought me to \"flavor town\".  (Guy Fieri please don't sue me for using the flavor town quote)"}
{"text":"We come here quite often and we take out for work lunches sometimes and it's always delicious! We love the doubles, the curry chicken and paratha.  The roti is fantastic, always fresh, and cheap enough that you don't feel bad about buying lunch. Try the curry mango with the roti!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying stuffed roti and doubles, I AM HOOKED! This place doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is cheap and delicious, my two favorite things! There is so much spice inside whatever the \"pepper\" option is for the roti, I was loving it! I had the shrimp roti and two doubles (2/$3.00) I finished everything which is very surprising because I can't really eat that much. I want to go back for breakfast, lunch and dinner tomorrow! Yummy times ahead at Drupati's."}
