{"text":"Just ate here... it was small and clean.  Just opened up 2 months ago. The owner was our server. Very nice. And answered all our questions. Started off with stuffed pepper soup. It was good.  Had a cheeseburger and my daughter had the chicken fajita wrap. Both were good.  Will definitely be going back. They only serve breakfast till noon so can't wait to try their breakfast.  I wish them the best of luck on the new place. It's yummy! !!!"}
{"text":"Great food ! Will come here again, !! And again and again and next time i will bring people"}
{"text":"O.K. This place is new (only 2 moths old) and there are always growing pains.  That being said, we really liked this place.  It's small (about 2 dozen seats), unassuming (you could easily pass it and never see it), very clean and the items we selected were very good, as was the service.  I ordered the Pig in the Garden.  Basically, a grilled cheese BLT sandwich.  It came with a choice of coleslaw, potato or mac salad ($5.50).  I went with the slaw and both were very tasty.    I am a BIG proponent of presentation and this was a time for it.  The rather flat square sandwich was on a plate all by itself and looked lost.  It should have been cut in half, stacked, with either the cup of slaw on the plate or some kind of garnish along side (pickle wedge - twisted orange slice - etc.).  This did not detract from the taste... however, you do eat with your eyes first.    My wife ordered the Old Fashion Grilled Cheese and a cup of Tomato Soup ($5.99 for both).  She asked for some grated cheese on the soup and was told they didn't have any.  We waited a little longer than we thought we should for our order, but then found out why...They sent an employee up the street to get some cheese to grate onto my wife's soup.  Bonus points for that effort!  There is no doubt that we will be back to try other things on their menu.  We hope that they do well since they are in a location that is notorious for restaurants coming and going quickly.  So if you are in the area, stop in...if you're not in the area, drive over...I doubt you will be disappointed in the food, the selection, the service or the prices."}
{"text":"Good food and plenty of it. Very pleasant staff. Liked the nostalgic decor. Need to go back to check out the grilled cheese lunches."}
{"text":"We are in love with this place and the guys that operate it. It is obviously their passion, they always have something new, eclectic, and tantalizing to indulge your taste buds. Great food, convivial, for foodies!"}
{"text":"This little place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is excellent.  They specialize in sandwiches.  The portions are good for the price.  Everything is fresh and cooked to order.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese places are all the rage right now. My husband noticed it when he was getting gas across the street at Get Go. Today we decided to give it a try at lunch time. It's a grilled cheese place but only offers a handful of grilled cheese sandwiches. I ordered the Italian Grilled Cheese. It had pizza sauce pepperoni and provolone cheese. I was a little disappointing to see that there really was no gooey cheesy goodness and there wasn't a lot of cheese or pepperoni on it. The flavor however was really good. The sauce was just right-a balance of tomatoes, garlic and spices. The outside of the sandwich was crispy and a little chewy which made it perfect. If I ordered it again I would ask them to double the cheese and the pepperoni. The sandwich (with fries and a pickle) was $5.99. I would be willing to pay more for the extra cheese and pepperoni.  My husband had the meatball sub. It was HUGE!  The meatballs were large and combined with the sauce and provolone cheese, were delicious. Again, I would order extra cheese.  The restaurant is painted in gray and black and it is extremely clean. The guys working were super nice. The guy working as a server was great about checking in on us. The surprise is that they also serve breakfast starting at 7am. Our fav breakfast place closed so we'll be back to try breakfast.  Great place, just needs MORE CHEESE!!"}
{"text":"Perfect for my picky 15 year old who loves grilled cheese. He wouldn't eat in the Strip District or downtown. On the way home we stopped at Medexpress for my husband. While waiting we took a very small walk here. Very nice and clean place. The workers were very nice also. He had the old fashioned with fries, it comes with soup but he wanted fries. The fries are good, just like Kennywood fries, natural cut. So glad we found this place, a place he likes to eat"}
{"text":"My grandfather went in and tried the roast beef sandwich and said it was delicious.  Also said the owner talked to him the whole time he was there and that he was the only one in there the whole time so hopefully they get busier.  I had my grandfather bring me a munchapalooza and omg.  It was delicious and huge.  It was a little soggy but that's what you get when you get a grilled cheese to go.  They even wrote thank you on my take out box."}
{"text":"My husband, two children and I went here for breakfast today.  The food was great!  I love that they used REAL eggs and not that slop out of a pourable container.  The French toast was delicious.  I was the only one in our party to order breakfast food and it was delicious.  My husband and daughter had burgers and they both said they were really good.  The serve fresh cut fries which were tasty as well.  The service was excellent and the gentleman who prepared our meal even came out to ask how it was.  We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I've gotten food here twice, each time it was super greasy. Not a fan of soggy and greasy French fries. Their breakfast sandwich wasn't horrible but it was also greasy, and I wasn't exactly pleased. I probably won't order here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Everything is homemade!!! I would recommend this place as the people are extremely polite, they take the time to welcome you, and the prices are unbeatable!!!  Their mashed potatoes are just like when you were growing up at mom's!! We will definitely be going back!!!"}
