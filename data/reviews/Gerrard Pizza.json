{"text":"The wait is very long, and the proprietor is brusque. There is a sign nestled high up near the doorway (facing in so you can't see it from outside), asking customers to please be patient because none of the food is prepared ahead of time. My husband and I did not see this sign until about half an hour after we ordered, and we were STARVING by the time the food arrived (about an hour later). The wait would honestly have been OK if the food were spectacular...but it wasn't even halfway decent. The pizza was lukewarm and the crust was burnt on the underside. The seafood pasta was also tepid when it came (with small, rubbery shrimp and some other unidentifiable meat), and both dishes were shockingly bland. Bland, tepid food is inexcusable even at McDonald's. It's even more inexcusable at $20 a person. And it's just plain infuriating after an hour of waiting. The only positive thing I can say about this establishment is that the decor is cute, with an old-school Italian ambiance--but despite boasting authentic Italian cuisine, the food is NOT AT ALL reminiscent of the fresh, aromatic fare I had in Italy. The annoying TV playing sports in the background does not reflect the high prices on the menu. I honestly wish we had spent half the money and enjoyed a better meal at East Side Mario's."}
{"text":"I think this is the best pizza I've ever had. Obviously, everyone has their own personal preference as to what makes for the best pizza, but for me this checks all the boxes.  The crust is flat, and sweet. You can almost break it apart with your tongue but it's still crisp. The toppings are incredibly fresh. We had the Primavera and the topics were fresh and tasty.  The cheese was high quality, and used sparingly and the sauce was delicious. I feel lucky to live near something so tasty.  I'd also like to add that the service was very warm and courteous."}
{"text":"Tired d√©cor, uninspired food, over-priced. Nice owner, but this is a last-resort restaurant for me."}
{"text":"It has a family oriented atmosphere. Good selection of pizzas on the menu and they are well prepared. The big drawback for me is the wait. We were waiting over an hour the last time I was there."}
{"text":"Service - very poor despite empty restaurant.  Had to ask for everything (napkins, plates, cutlery, menu).   Calamari - rubbery, greasy, no flavour  Arancini - grease soaked, very plain, no flavour, tiny portion of meat inside  Chose not to order more based on poor quality of apps. The pizza COULD be OK but im guessing its not great based on what ive seen.   Poor beer selection  No atmosphere due to no patrons at dinner time.  Soap operas and news playing on small tv.  No music.    Seems to be a family restaurant with no passion  Would never return or recommend. Several ok options in area (Wren, libretto, etc)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The gluten free pizza crust is delicious! Crispy and thin crust and cooked perfectly. The toppings are fresh and evenly distributed. Highly recommended - one of the best gluten free crusts that I have tried. It's great for take-out."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the Danforth- hands down. Nice ambiance as well."}
{"text":"This is about as authentic as Italian food gets in Toronto. Olive oil made in the family's farm in Italy is for sale on a shelf. You can see grandma and grandpa in the back working over huge pots making one, two and three day's supply of the major fixin's; the rest is done while you wait (which is why it's not fair to complain about slow service). Most regions of Italy are represented by at least one dish. What defines its authenticity to me is the absence of what Tony Weis calls \"meatification,\" a trend I have a bit of a rant about in my book, The No-Nonsense Guide to World Food. The Mediterranean diet is about featuring fruit, veggies, olive oil and fish; red meat is marginal, not central, as in North America.  This restaurant is not vegetarian (though there are several vegetarian choices), but it is low-meat. I think that takes real integrity to uphold that tradition, and that's one reason why I come here for authentic Italian food that's also quite affordable.  Very family-friendly, as you would expect Italian places to be, and Vito can be quite cheeky in a charming kind of way.--wayne r"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and never been disappointed.  The pizzas are incredible.  Try one with topped with fresh basil the owner grows himself - superb.  The pastas are also among the best I have enjoyed anywhere in the world, including Italy.  This is true, homemade Italian cooking.  If that's not your thing, don't bother.  It seems people like to complain about the wait.  I've never been bothered by it, maybe 30 minutes tops.  Which is what I expect a freshly prepared meal to take.   Order some wine, have a freaking conversation.  If you need your food in ten minutes, there is a table waiting for you at the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Service- Excellent Service, Attentive Ambience- Very nice restaruant, comfortable feeling (but not comfortable chairs as the legs kind a poke into the side of your thighs and being wooden chairs it starts to wear on your legs- a easy fix if change the seat cushions to larger more dense ones).  They recently put up new signs outside which is what caught our attention to walk-in and try it out.  Glad we did. For a Friday night there was a pretty good crowd by 7:00pm almost all the tables were full. Nice place for a date they serve alcohol and a variety of drinks. Candle lit tables, semi dim lighting.  Great for local fare! Food- Be patient as everything is made from scratch.  Large menu with lots of options, had a hard time choosing. Had warm bread & butter brought to the table with a small starter salad that came with the pasta.  The pasta was fresh and AMAZING and we will definetly be back to try out more dishes!! We also split a pizza (Carmela) which was also great, but did not compare to the yummy pasta- still very tastey though. For both the bill ran to $50 bucks with two pops. I think overall the pasta (Ferrazzuoi Calabresi) just won both of us over so easily with the ambience that they won the 4*"}
{"text":"Solid classic pizza joint.  Pizzas are consistently good.  Sauce is tasty, cheese is yummy, crust is good and medium thickness.  Service is quick and staff friendly and helpful. Prices very reasonable and parking is easy on this part of Danforth, especially when picking up in the evening since it is on the north side of Danforth. Convenient, tasty and unpretentious."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that could be used for a formal date, but is best suited for casual to business casual dress, and very utilitarian. Just eat  if you must, and leave.  I ordered a Hawaiian pizza, as the staff said that although I might get the toppings on a traditional pizza, north American-style pizza is being sold here. I asked for some hot peppers on it also as I love and tolerate very hot.   I can tell that my pizza would have been excellent but it was absolutely killed with hot spice like real suicide wings. It might have been one of the best pizza's ever if they didn't murder it.  My girlfriend ordered a pasta with Alfredo sauce, which the server said was an option. It arrived in red sauce, as the menu-stated. She decided to gamble and try it. She didn't like it. So she tried my pizza, but couldn't eat that either over it being so spicy hot (although she likes hot too.)   I tried her pasta. The sauce was like tomato juice, not sauce. Tasted more like pizza sauce. It was bland, watery, warm, and actually just CRAPPY.  That plate of pasta was over $20. I would have been happier with those $1.50 boxes of pasta with the yellow powder... you know the ones I'm talking about.   We ordered 2 house white wines. I know - verboten with red stuff, but I really just wanted it. We were served 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio that tasted like the bottle had been sitting uncovered in a fridge for weeks.  The child who initially served the table was very polite, as was the adult server. The warm bread and butter was also a nice touch. The place was clean and under different circumstances the place might have been my go-to. By \"circumstances\" I mean food and service.  When the time came to ask for the bill, I simply could not raise the server who was overlooking the whole restaurant. After a solid 20 minutes of waiting, with plates that I had deliberately piled up in front of me at the table to get attention, I walked up to the bar to cash out. He was texting away on his phone.  The waiter had to get the cook/ owner to cash me out because apparently he didn't have cash privileges. So more waiting behind a walk-in pizza order.  No one was interested if we liked our meal, even with all of the left overs in the plates, and the owner didn't seem to know any pleasantries like thank you, etc.   Normally I would leave a $0.10 tip or something to make sure that they understood that I wasn't happy - not cheap. But this time I just withheld tip altogether. One was totally undeserving.    And for a personal pizza, a plate of pasta, 2 glasses of wine, the grand total was $64.24. That bill should have been in the $45 neighbourhood, tops, for what we got. It would have been much better spent elsewhere.  As a side note, I told my Godfather about this experience. He lives in that neighbourhood and knows all these places on the Danforth from years back. He likes to eat out frequently, had dealings once with the same very identifiable owner once, who showed the same ignorance, and hence he never returned. Too bad for Gerrard Spaghetti & Pizza House because my Godfather can eat."}
{"text":"Friends and I got together here a couple of years ago for a casual birthday dinner and really enjoyed it.  In fact, my memory is that this was some of the best pizza I have ever had in Toronto.  Basically there are a million gourmet pies to choose from on the menu.  The wait is a little longer and obviously there are cheaper ways to get a pizza but Gerrard's is worth the time and money.  Service was quite good too.  Beyond birthday dinners, this would be a great place for a family dinner or a date.  It just might be good enough to cross the Don for--it is certainly not to be missed if you are anywhere along the Danforth.  I'm looking forward to going back some day.  Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"My seven year old daughter and I were excited to bring my friend and his little girl to this place for dinner, having heard so many good things about the pizza. We ordered three simple 12\" pizzas. Long story short: 30 minutes later we still had only water at our table and the kids were crawling over themselves with impatience.  The waiter apologized when we asked for some bread to tie them over, and ten minutes later even that hadn't arrived. I finally walked up to the bar where the kitchen door was and asked someone for some bread and was told that they were 'warming it up', and said I've got two weeping kids at our table and it doesn't need to be warm. Finally the bread arrived and then the pizza 10 minutes later -- overdone and dry. I appreciate that fresh food takes time to prepare but 50 minutes for three simple pizzas is not acceptable. The waiter clearly knew I wasn't happy but there was no offer of anything to compensate for the experience. As we left, my daughter asked we not go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and it was incredible, the best bruschetta we have ever had. The restaurant was pretty busy but the sever was great. He was friendly, quick witted and knowledgeable. We had pasta that was spectacular we will definitely be going back again. Super Yummy!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, overpriced, sassy staff and they brought us the wrong food! But it took so long (literally over an hour despite there being only 2 other tables with people at them) that we just dealt with it. Other tables got their food before us even though they came in much later than we did. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Contrary to it's name this eatery is located on the Danforth near Coxwell. I came across this place whilst hankering for pasta.  I had a seafood pasta of somesort though the name escapes me and it was certainly tasty enough, though a little over salted.   The wait was a tad long even for their sign \"Our food is not pre-cooked. Please be patient -- good food takes time.\"  especially as I was the only person in the restaurant save the one lady who came to get a pizza (which looking at their menu seemed like it would be quite good).  If the whim so inclined me I may visit here again but it would really be a roll of the dice."}
{"text":"i live in the area and eat here regularly. i don`t find the service slow at all. it does take some time to make the pizza fresh, but i`ve never had any issues. the selection is amazing, the pizzas are consistently yummy and it`s a nice neighbourhood restaurant. great for families and take-out too."}
{"text":"Homemade everything! Authentic pastas, pizzas. We went with party of 6, ordered everything we could on the menu and shared. It was ALL GOOD.  Its not the fanciest spot but the food is definitely worth the trip. All the reviews were saying that they were waiting for a long time for the food we didn't really wait that long at all. If you are in a rush hit the east side marios but if you want the real deal hit this cute little place."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend 10 days ago for takeout. Medium Hawaiian. Pizza was so so but I couldn't believe what happened when he went to pay with his Visa card. The card reader was Pre - programmed to force you to leave a tip. This was takeout only so we weren't going to leave a tip. He tried to enter a zero for tip % but the card reader wouldn't let him so to complete the transaction he entered 1%. WTF!?  programming a forced tip into the card reader. What a ridiculous practice. Even for dine in, what if you experience terrible service dining in? Why should you be forced to leave a tip.  Neither of us will give this place our business again."}
