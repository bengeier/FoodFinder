{"text":"Awesome! This place has it all! Clean, fast service! Loved the free appetizer! The sauce is so good!!!! The best egg drop soup I have had in long time!!! They even have chicken nuggets for the kids!! My son ate everyone of them!!!!! They have some really awesome lunch deals!!! This place is a must try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and prices, I've never been disappointed. I've gotten the sushi and it always tastes fresh and they have no problems altering food to meet your needs. Try the crab rangoon and the  mixed veggie soup in the eggdrop broth. So yum!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best place for Chinese / Japanese cuisine I have ever ate at. To give an example of how good it is when my son was born the first place he went after leaving the hospital was Peking Tokyo  the service is great they remember our drinks and our most common foods we order. never had a empty glass. Great place. Small restaurant but when there is a wait it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had the Orange Duck and a Godzilla roll. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Gozilla roll is HORRIBLE. Fish taste/texture feels like CANNED fish. One bite and I was done. Paid my bill, left a good tip, but NEVER again."}
{"text":"I like the food better here than at Red Bowl...more reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Great place. Owner and staff are super nice and the food is some of the better asian food you'll find near Tega Cay."}
{"text":"Peking Tokyo never disappoints. I've been there at least once a week since it opened, and each visit offers a new and tasty experience....Singapore Mei Fun is outstanding, and don't miss the Rock Shrimp, it's totally delicious. Chicken on a Stick is very tasty, soups are all good and always hot...service is first rate and prices cannot be beat. AND, the sushi cannot be beaten, best in the area.....this is THE PLACE for Chinese/Japanese food in Tega Cay!"}
{"text":"I haven't had good Chinese since moving to NC from NY a year ago. We tried just about every place people swore to us was \"the best\" and it was nothing but disappointment. I was expecting Peking Tokyo to be another let down but I was pleasantly surprised. When I called to order I told them I just moved into my development and they offered to send plates, cutlery, napkins, and some ice to go along with our sodas. I ordered the chicken and broccoli meal (with rice) and my husband got sesame chicken meal. Both came with egg rolls but I swapped mine out for a small cup of egg drop wonton. The food was FAST! It got to us (piping hot!) within 15 minutes. My chicken in broccoli sauce wasn't greasy and was very fresh. Broccoli was cooked to perfect. My husband loved the sesame chicken he said it wasn't overly breaded and the chicken was all white meat. My egg drop wonton soup great. Some places thicken their soup with something and it almost jello like. Their soup was thin and more naturally thick with egg. The wontons were perfect sized and tasty. The egg roll had this wasabi taste to it though. I wasn't a big fan but my husband who never eats egg rolls loved it. I think it's more of a preference thing so can't hold it against them. I also loved how accommodating they were. They packed us everything we would need to dinner even down the extra cups of ice. Very thoughtful! 

This is going to be my go-to delivery! So happy to have good Chinese takeout again!"}
{"text":"Just been here a few times but the people are awesome no attitude try to answer all your questions and serving sizes are very large and the prices are pretty cheap"}
{"text":"Trying to find good sushi in South Carolina while on a road trip I thought would be easy.  Turns out, not so easy.  Without Yelp it would have been almost impossible without killing hours.  When entering Peking, we were very happy with what we saw. A modern, upscale, urban, clean feel.  We had 6 or 7 different types of rolls and all were good tasting, a few were also very good.  The people are nice, the product is solid, and we left satisfied."}
{"text":"Nestled in a very unassuming spot in a strip mall next to the J&S Butcher shop.  I've had Sushi there twice and it's among the best I've had in the region. The Sushi chef/owner is a really cool guy who goes the extra mile to make your meal an awesome experience.  Sushi quality is top-notch and presented beautifully. You can tell he enjoys what he's doing.  I've had friends order the Chinese food there too and they all agreed it was fantastic.  I'm so glad I don't have to go far anymore for great sushi."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some takeout. Ordered the General Tao's w/Brown fried rice. The person behind the counter looked at me like  I had 3 heads. He asked a few question just to clarify. A few minutes later the chef came out to ask a question concerning the Brown fried rice. When all was said and done, they really stepped up to the plate. The Brown fried rice was outstanding. I will be returning"}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese food in the Carolinas!! There shrimp egg rolls are amazing. Customer service is great. I'm defiantly a regular."}
{"text":"Try the Singapore mei fun if you like curry and spicy."}
{"text":"This place is not as great as the reviews that led me here lead me to believe. The sushi was not fresh at all!! And for the prices they charge it is a crying shame. I will not be coming here again that's for sure"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch or dinner at a great price.
Quality food and service!
The lunch special is a great deal and delicious!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever review a restaurant but I had to review this one.  My husband and I had a craving for Chinese food, so we ordered take out from here. What we got was beyond bland, we had to throw out our entire order.  We ordered Hunan Roast Pork, General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Mei Fun, Roast Pork Fried rice, Ribs and Tako Su.  I cannot believe that none of the dishes had any flavor except the Tako Su, which I believe had wasabi mixed in the extremely oily sauce, which for Tako Su should not have been oily and the octopus was rough and really hard to find, for Tako Su that's a feat considering that is supposed to be the main ingredient.  I come from NY where we would order 'real' Chinese on a regular basis. I was so disappointed I had to call the restaurant just to let the owner know, maybe he didn't taste the food, who knows.  All I know is that we will never go back ever.  I wonder if those rave reviewers have damaged tastebuds???"}
{"text":"My wife and I like this place and it's 1 of our 2 go-to places for Asian food in the area.  This one often wins out because of the option for Sushi under the same roof.  The Chinese dishes aren't anything all that special, pretty standard stock for any Chinese place.  Same for the Sushi, but price is right and it's good and convenient location when out to grab dinner/lunch plus run errands."}
{"text":"This is by far the freshest,most colorful and delicious Chinese food in the area. The service is fantastic as well,try the Hunan chicken and the sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've had since moving to the south.
I love the delivery service. I wish other area restaurant's would deliver."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time.  My friends wanted to try the sushi.  I'm not a big sushi fan.  However, they convinced me to try it and I must say, its the best I had. I'll go back here for sushi. My friends loved it! Atmosphere was good too!"}
{"text":"Having discovered this place using Yelp and UrbanSpoon, I feel as if we just stumbled on a jewel for Chinese food in the Fort Mill / Tega Cay area. Here's the skinny on why this place gets five stars: 

1. Value - excellent pricing for good portions. I mean REALLY excellent pricing. 

2. Quality - excellent quality of food. I am a Sesame Chicken snob - not too sweet and well cooked. 

3. Cleanliness - Bathrooms were clean (a stickler for me), and quite a bit of care has gone into the details of the interior with a nice design. 

I really hope Peking Tokyo stays around...good food, friendly staff, clean environment and affordable. 

Keep up the good work Peking Tokyo!"}
{"text":"Friends, family, coworkers - all of them look at me with stupefied expressions when I tell them one of my top 3 Charlotte area sushi places is in the Fort.  Its true though - this place has great sushi.  Fresh, interesting, and reasonably priced.   The dining room is a little small and non-descript, but this place is perfect for take out or on-the-way-home sushi.

EXPERT TIP - ask for a Cherry Blossom.  Its not on their standard menu, but its easily my favorite roll.  If you like cucumber sheet sushi, the Rainbow Naruto roll is also fantastic.  

SUPER EXPERT TIP - all of my Peking Tokyo fortune cookies have come true."}
{"text":"We order from here quite a bit and food is great. The only issue is that if you order delivery it takes much too long to get your order. We average at least an hour to hour and a half. It's gotten so bad we don't order delivery any more. Wish they would have at least apologized and maybe offer something for our trouble. Disappointed because we use to eat and order from here so much more than we do now."}
{"text":"Really good all the way around. Decor is very nice and feels sort of upscale vs cheesy.  Great service, very attentive and knowledgeable. Most importantly - the food is good. Really haven't found better around here yet.  Maybe a tad pricey, but worth it because you will have leftovers."}
{"text":"Very good chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice. Probably the best I've had.
Sushi was ok, price was right."}
{"text":"I'm with NP, this place is average at best and I am surprised by the rave reviews as well - so I'm giving it a Meh 2 star review.

As we just moved to another south Charlotte area, we decided to get on the hunt for a Chinese restaurant.  As close as this one is across the border, sadly this will not be the one. 

I typically order sesame chicken when I go to Chinese restaurants and it was no different here.  While the presentation is A+, the taste was not as flavorful as other restaurants we have gone to.  I was also disappointed that they put the broccoli on the side instead of letting it soak up the sauce and other flavors, so instead you get bland steamed broccoli.  The sauce was also very thick around the chicken, so there was nothing extra to pour ontop of the rice or let the rice soak up the sauce either.

I am not sure what Kevin ordered, some chicken dish.  Now the veggies in here were nice as they soaked up the sauce and flavor very well.  I think the only complaint is when Kevin has typically ordered this dish elsewhere, it is mild, and here it was very spicy.

Nice little quiet restaurant, but we will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We we were enticed to eat at this place by a coupon.   We were glad with our choice.  The dinner entree, kung pao chicken arrived steamy and decorated with slices of orange.   It was mild hot, for American palates, but it was one of the best Kung Paos I've ever had.  My husbad ordered the combination of General Tsos, plain fried rice,  eggroll (it was vegetarian, cabbage only) and many broccoli pieces. This was just ok for me but my husband liked it very much.  Again the heat level was very low.  The wantan  soup was ok made with  light broth  (I don't like dark broths).  

Place was modest and bright,  service was friendly but nobody came to check if everything was ok (nothing major, but I needed a knife).    Overall, we willl gladly return."}
{"text":"Great random find! The General Tso's here is great, and spicy. The low mein is prepared very well, and the menu is reasonably priced.

They also have sushi and some limited Thai items on the menu."}
{"text":"First thought bring a sweater brrr
Prompt service, very nice.
Lettuce wraps arrived pre-made but was good, no sauces like at PF Chang's.
Chicken lo mein lacked in vegetables 
Pepper steak not flavorful."}
{"text":"OK so I absolutely have to edit this post. I got takeout from here once and it wasn't the best but they have been amazing ever since! Glad we gave them another shot!"}
{"text":"I am a true love of Asian food and this has to be the worst Asian food I have had in years. I ordered the Mongolian beef with fried rice and hot and sours soup. Also Thai basal chicken with noodles. Oh my god I don't know where to begin it was so bad. Let's start with the service the man at the register is rude.
He is not welcoming at all just take your Order and be done with you. When I got my order and the bag was all stapled a young lady handed me my bag of food and said is there anything else I said yes hot oil please. Just in enough year shot for the mad to rush over and scold the lady for going to go get me hot oil and it was in the bag. It's not her fault she did not know she was just trying to service me. Now on to the food I have never tasted hot and sour soup with no flavor st all. I had to Come home and add some seasoning just to make it edible. Next I tried the Mongolian bees with fried rice,
The taste was sour and the meat disolved in my mouth. Obviously this is not beef.
I found hair not only in my soup but also in my basil chicken. The basis chicken which was supposed to be this came with lomein noodles which should have been my first warning sign which I had to pay a $1.50 extra for the noodles. Next the dish itself had so much basil that you could taste noting else. This is the worst experience and if I could give negative stars I would, will not be going back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't dine in here. I only say that because it's a small area and it seemed like Togo orders were their main concern.  The food was delicious though. I really like the fact they checked to go orders frequently to make sure it was right. But as far as dining in... I wouldn't ever again.  The server seemed to forgot about our order until I said something 45 mins after we put our order in. As soon as I mentioned it the food came out right away as if it was sitting around."}
{"text":"Another handy dandy WIN for the Yelp mobile app!

Sure, like previous reviews have mentioned this place is tiny and crammed but really does have some amazing food. 

I stopped in right before the lunch rush. There is nothing fancy on the inside, a couple of tables and booths but the staff is friendly and the service is very fast. 

They have a GREAT lunch menu, plenty of variety with a small price tag of $5.25. I went with the shrimp and broccoli, steamed rice and egg roll (you have the choice of soup or egg roll). 

Before I knew it my food was ready, I asked if I could have some wontons and sweet sauce and they very happily put some in my bag. Boy was I in for a treat, no itty bitty shrimp here! They were nice plump, full size shrimp. The brown sauce and crispy texture on the broccoli was delicious. The steamed rice was sticky goodness, loaded up with soy sauce and mixed all together....perfect! I loved it! 

This is definitely some good Chinese food. Best thing, it's freshly prepared per order so everything comes out nice and hot. Good stuff here! 

Do yourself a favor...give this place a try!"}
{"text":"During a recent hunger attack while in Rock Hill at an exit where the options left a lot to be desired, we hit Yelp on a search for decent food.  We arrived at Peking Tokyo in the new strip mall in front of a new Wal-Mart.  They did a nice job turning a very basic space into something that didn't evoke cheap strip mall diner. They used giant bamboo for railing, and used nice paint, etc. They have 4 booths and a number of tables, but is a quaint size, allowing service to be active.

It's unusual to mix Americanized Chinese food with sushi at a small restaur, but they do both here so we tried the Peking Tokyo roll and the orange chicken with brown rice. The orange chicken was nice and came with a good amount of perfectly-cooked broccoli.  It was very crunchy, which means it was very fried. Good, but I probably wouldn't order it again b/c of the fried-ness. I might try the moo shu because they said they have the traditional thin pancakes which I haven't seen yet in the CLT area.  

However, the Peking Tokyo roll was amazing! Really one of the top rolls in the area! Fresh, flavorful but without relying too much on sauce, spice,  or frying. It was just a solid, excellent, fresh roll. We will definitely be back to try more sushi and wished we had just ordered rolls! My only complaint? I wish they had gone a little lighter on the fish eggs, but that's probably just me.

Bottom line:  Best sushi in the Fort Mill/Tega Cay area and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE place to go for Chinese! The crispy noodles and spicy duck sauce is very simple, but oh so delicious!! I've tried multiple dishes on the menu and have never been disappointed. It's a go to place for my fiancé and I!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here down to the last bite... last bite I could take. The serving size to super large, I could have shared this meal but I happily took it for lunch instead. 
It's a really cute small restaurant with just a few table. I had eaten take out from here and I wasn't super impressed with it so I was hesitant about going for a sit down. I'm so glad I did, it was 100 times better! 
Food came out promptly and in abundance. It was hot and looked pretty on my plate. They left crunchy noodles and the most amazing sauce to dip. I LOVED it. 

I ate the orange chicken, I would absolutely recommend it. I ordered it both times... it was so good I didn't want to vary my choices. Yum yum yum. I can't wait to go back for dinner.  

Super family friendly as well! Take your kids here folks."}
{"text":"Because of the \"well-known Asian bistro\" down the street- this little gem gets overlooked.  Give this place a try and you will be pleased.  The value , service and quality can't be beat! 
The lunch specials are great, the portions are generous and the staff is so accommodating.  I usually get the hibachi chicken. Don't miss the sweet/spicy sauce that's served with the crunchy noodles."}
{"text":"I have the Hunan Triple, spicy and filling.y wife gets sushi and loves it!  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great vibes and atmosphere...relaxing music! Attentive staff, they give a complimentary appetizer of chips and some kind of Thai chili dipping sauce, so nice. Food came out promptly, we had the wonton egg drop soup, crab Rangoon, miso soup, ginger salad, sushi and hibachi...all of it was delicious!!! We will definitely be back! My only issue was that part of the sushi menu didn't have descriptions and I had to ask about each one."}
{"text":"Ma Po tofu - tasteless brown sauce with frozen vegetables and flabby cold tofu. The menus were dirty."}
{"text":"the food was not good at all. The chicken wings are salty and fried too hard and the Lo mien was spaghetti."}
{"text":"I've given Peking Tokyo 3 chances.   It is just average food and an odd smell.   The restaurant is small (and seemed tight to walk through).  There are only about 8-10 tables in the restaurant and there are customers and wait staff walking past your table all the time.

Unless you are in the mood for average chinese food, tv, and watching kids running around, skip it.

Things I tried:
   Sushi - Godzilla roll   
   Basil Chicken - average
   Edamame
   Seafood delite - no flavor, fake crab"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in Ft Mill! Try the Rainbow Naruto, especially if you aren't into rice! The staff is always very attentive and friendly. We haven't had the cooked entrees, but they always look delicious."}
{"text":"They got an inspection score of 80 on 12/5.  This is a place that serves raw fish.  Yes, their follow up inspection on 12/12 gave them a 99, but two grades in the 80s in a 3 months for a sushi place is not good.  They were so good before, and always had an A...not anymore."}
{"text":"Small Japanese joint in the graystone compound.  The food is alright.  I mean have taken to-go a couple times and felt the taste is alright, not great.  Have just tried the couple veggie entrees with tofu and veg. fried rice.  The tofu was too soft and I personally do not like super soft tofu.  The veg. fried rice was good, surprisingly not too oily like in many other Asian joints.  Their spice levels seems to be very low comparing normal spicy levels so make sure you ask for extra spicy if you like that hot touch to your food.
Very neat ambience, very clean inside, very nice people."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very clean restaurant, above average food. While not the best, really what more can you ask from a chinese fast food joint?"}
{"text":"I'm with Tina C this is fort mills best asian bistro. Their sushi rocks.The pan fried dumplings are obviously fresh and homemade. The general tso's could be a little bigger and more cripy. overall a great little place."}
{"text":"We have not ordered food from here in a few years so we figured we'd give them a try again. I am befuddled by the reviews that say this place is good. My husband ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and he said it's boring and nothing special. I got the Orange Chicken and asked for it to be extra spicy. Not only was it not extra spicy, it was not spicy period. It was boring and fatty. My son ordered a spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name) and the shrimp was so severely overdone that when I tried it I almost spit it out. My son didn't like the dish, either. My other son got an order of spare ribs. They were terribly, terribly dry. My daughter had a order of friend chicken. She said it tasted fine but didn't love it. 

I felt like I would have better off flushing our money down the toilet than paying for that garbage food. Yes, that is a harsh thing to say but it's the complete truth. I hope my review saves you from wasting your money there. I wish I could write a good review because the people who work there are really nice."}
{"text":"Great little family owned local Chinese food restaurant that also houses a nice assortment of fresh simple sushi. Fast takeout service. My kids love this place. Not fancy, but not mall food either. A nice in between place to go with the kids that's reasonably priced and family owned in town. My kids who are teens call it \"Pecking Tokyo.\" I think most of the teens do. Nice people. :)  Love it!"}
{"text":"Okay.. I have had the sushi here and well, it is the best sushi I have had in this area. The place is so clean and relaxing.  The sushi was so clean and fresh tasting, the pieces were giant sized and filled me up.  The prices were great and it was well worth the cost. 
I have to say that the sushi is way better than Red bowl and Asian roll and grill and I love the food from both of these places. Hands down sushi was the best from here. 
Go and get this awesome sushi give this place the support it needs!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Tried this place for the first time and did take out. Told 20-25 minutes, turned out to be close to an hour. Everything we ordered was really bland compared to other area restaurants, and an hour later both me and my wife were nauseous.  We threw out the leftovers. Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes for drinks then another 15 for them to take our order. We got up and left seeing as this probably wasn't going to work out well. They were drowning in to-go orders and completely ignoring the dine-in guests. All the while continuing to take orders on the phone. They even yelled in the face of a customer who was waiting on food???? Seriously, you raised your voice at a customer. At some point you have to let customer satisfaction come before greed guys.
No comment on the food since we never got any."}
{"text":"Situated in Fort Mill, this restaurant is a drive away from Charlotte. Entering inside you get a feeling of an intricately decorated Japanese restaurant but once you see the walls, the size of the small room becomes reality and turns you claustrophobic at times. The menu was quite a large menu with lots of the regular Japanese usuals and a good variety sushi as well. We went for the regulars, General Tso chicken and fried rice. Our waitress was very friendly and brought us some tempura fries and sweet sauce. We also asked for an extra bowl of the tempura and she was glad to bring us one. 

We didn't wait long for our order, and everything was hot and fresh. The quantity was huge and plentiful. It wasn't the neither best tasting dish nor too bad. It's also incredibly inexpensive for a Japanese dine in restaurants.

Though Peking Tokyo doesn't offer the best dining experience, it's still worth a try for the friendly service, budget pricing and large quantities of good food!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good take put Chinese. The quality can waver from time to time, but it's never bad. I really enjoy the Crab Rangoon and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. We also usually get the Pork Fried Rice. 

All the entrées come with white rice, but they will swap it out for fried rice for a little more. The fried rice has lots if stuff in it ( peas, carrots, bean sprouts and what ever protein you chose). 

Overall, it's enjoyable food. They give you lots with every order, so we always have leftovers. We probably get at least 3 meals from an order."}
{"text":"I love hibachi steak and chicken....I've had it at 20+ places. I used to say it's kinda like pizza and sex when it's good, it's great and when it's bad it's still good....but hibachi steak and chicken for lunch take out at Peking Tokyo was horrid. Steak burned and a few little chunks. Chicken looked like the fat I cut off and cook for my dog. The veggies were ok, but everything was in some watery broth. It leaked out of the container trying to get it out of the bag. Yum yum (shrimp) sauce was way too small a container. It comes with a salad and soup for lunch which I didn't want or eat. Just really a bad experience."}
{"text":"Stopping through town for work and this place was excellent for lunch. 9.95 hibachi meal with rice, veggies, soup and salad was great and the portions were huge. Looked like the same size as you would get at an actual steakhouse hibachi."}
{"text":"I caught this place on my way home from a GoRuck event. It was a cold and rainy Saturday night and their food was perfect! While my order was very simple, shrimp lo mein and crab rangoon, both items were executed perfectly. The lo mein had plenty of shrimp and vegetables in a very well-sized serving. My only complaint was that the crab rangoon were not as crispy as I like but that could be from the rain in the air and it being a takeout order. I will definitely be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"I love Peking Tokyo! They are my go to place when I get stuck at work with no lunch break! They deliver and the food is always good. Great service, reasonable prices, and the chicken on a stick is some of the best!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese restaurant.  When I first moved to Fort Mill/Tega Cay, I tried every local Chinese restaurant sampling wonton soup, steamed dumplings,  lo mein and egg roll . Peking Tokyo made all of these items the best and they always have great customer service. They also have brown rice which was hard to find. 

This is one of those \"American\" style Chinese restaurants that everyone is used to, but it's great. They also have some Thai and Japanese dishes, but I prefer sticking to the Chinese. I have gone for sushi on occasions and enjoyed it. The space is a little small to dine in, but It's cozy and has Chinese artwork on the wall. Also when you dine in, they give you some fried wonton chips and sweet chili sauce to dip it in. 

The food is awesome and tastes less greasy than others. Presentation for dining in is always gorgeous and portions are huge. They have combinations that come with rice and an egg roll for lunch and dinner. Some of my favorites are Mongolian chicken, Hunan chicken, lo mein, chow mei fun and sesame chicken. 

On my most recent trip, I got a wonton soup and roast pork lo mein. Their wonton soup is not overly salty and has a nice mild flavor. Two wonton come in a small and four in a large. I also always get this when I'm sick. The egg roll is large, nice and crispy and has savory cabbage and vegetables inside. The roast pork lo mein has a slightly sweet flavor, crisp (not overcooked) vegetables, very tender roast pork and tender noodles to soak it all up. 

This is a great family-owned business. I've never had a bad experience. It's simply the vest Chinese in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"We ordered sashimi here and the quality of the fish although fresh was not top notch.  The service was really good.  I think if you ordered sushi or something similar it would be good"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese/japanese ive ever had. Undercooked rice, no flavor, and was that supposed to be chicken??? Seems like just fried bits. Egg roll bland and was nothing more than a cabbage roll with no season or taste. Then after telling them I still get stuck with the bill."}
{"text":"It was OK.  Not great but not bad.  Best thing was quality of the sushi and that was very good.  The decor is a bit drab and the sushi bar was packed with cheap display pieces like a mountain waterfall.  How nice - but what we need is a place to set our water & sushi! Oh yeah, no alcohol on sundays!!"}
{"text":"Ordered cashew chicken. Flavor was off and it had only a little bit of zucchini for vegetables.   The chickens texture was lumpy and hard."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews about a sushi place so close to my house, I was excited to try it. My husband and I went in for dinner recently and ordered edamame, as well as one roll each. The edamame was fine, the service was great, but unfortunately I have to say that the sushi was just mediocre. I've had much better sushi at other small local places. The variety in the rolls was also just ok. I was bummed... If we want sushi again, I think we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Peking has been our goto place for several years......best sushi in the area (and we have tried them all!)...all other food is good too, very clean, and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They are always super friendly when we come in and the food is consistently delicious!  Not super expensive and great service!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with my wife months ago and forgot to write the review. We have been going back regularly, which I guess is a compliment in itself.

Disclaimers first. This is essentially a Chinese restaurant that is trying to cater to both the Chinese and sushi crowds. And that is not the right move for them.

I say that because their Chinese food is excellent! I've tried their Hot & Sour soup, their spring and egg rolls, sweet & sour pork, fried rice - the list goes on and on... Thumbs up on all of them!

Now on to the sushi side of things... My wife tried a spicy tuna roll, and did not feel well afterwards at all! So I do not recommend any of it. Stick to the Chinese food here, people!

Service is really friendly, they're usually open late (10pm?) and therefore are a regular take-away option for us as well.

Considering all of the above, I still consider myself a fan. We just stick to their A game..."}
{"text":"I got hibachi chicken. The chicken was dry with a brown sauce and the vegetables were steamed with water no sauce. This is not hibachi. Thank goodness the white dipping sauce was on the side or I wouldn't have ate it. One person at our table got the shrimp and that was the only good thing at our table besides the white sauce. We will not ever be back not sure how they have four stars."}
{"text":"Not on part with New York Chinese cuisine but they do a good job.  I usually get the garlic shrimp,  I wish it was spicier but tasty none the less.   The soup is a little skimpy,  a large wonton only had three wontons in it.  The sushi is also not too bad, I got the spider roll and kids had California rolls.  Fried rice is a little weak, not much in it.  It is good though for the price especially when your craving some Asian food.  It's strange though,  no matter what we order whether it's 3 or 5 dinners, it's always the same price, $38.  I think there is only one button on the register.   The pace also gets crowded for lunch time specials."}
{"text":"The carry out order over the phone went smoothly. Once I got to the restaurant to pick up my order the cashier repeated my order: everything was correct, great. As soon as I got home and dug everything out of the bag some were incorrect. I've ordered egg rolls and gotten vegetable rolls instead. Ordered salt & pepper shrimp but received the walnut shrimp and I have also ordered the seafood delight only to find out there were not any lobster like it specify under the description of the item. 
I wanted to call to complain bec it was a big order but what were they going to say? I'm sorry? 
Food was okay. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Horible.....Nothing else to say. Go Somewhere else. Im gonna spend my night throwing up now. Thanks Peking Tokyo!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service where you wouldn't expect it. We tried a Chinese dish and sushi (rolls and pieces). All were delicious. Vegetables are very fresh. Recommend it highly"}
{"text":"I decided to make Peking Tokyo our dinner choice tonight. The menu looked nice and the place was right next door to yoga. 
 The dining area is very small. I placed an order to go. Roast pork fried rice, orange chicken, egg foo young and Szechuan beef. The food came out pretty quick. But... there was an error with the order. The cashier actually offered me a dollar out of the tip jar, which broke my heart. They also offered me a free drink, just to try and make amends. My wife came in from yoga and took them up on the drink. 
 Now for the meal. 
 My orange chicken left a lot to be Desired. Lots of orange taste, which was nice, but not spicy at all and the breading seemed to turn into mush.
 The roast pork fried rice, I felt was dry and lacking flavor. 
My son enjoyed his meal, but he was hungry and didn't pay, so he was happy. 
 My wife seemed to enjoy her egg foo young, but wasn't overwhelmed by it: 
In conclusion, I believe this is a first and last for us."}
{"text":"We order Peking a lot at work for delivery and it is usually pretty good.  There have been times where the delivery took over 1.5 hours and times were it comes within 15 minutes.  I order the Chicken Teriyaki with fried rice and it generally very good.  A few times the chicken was dry and lacking flavor, but the rice usually makes up for it.  The vegetables are very fresh and hot!  It's my go to for quick meals!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Asian food in the area . Japanese and Chinese food items are always fresh and delicious! When we order takeout , we always get two meals out of the portions. Great value ."}
{"text":"If you like tasty food, I am disappointed to say this would not be the place I'd recommend. The shrimp toast was disgusting and 4 of 5 items ordered were tasteless. On a good note, the food was ready for pick up at the time they said, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. The portions are a decent size and each lunch combination is around $5 that includes soup! The hot and sour soup is probably one of the best I've tasted in a while. You can dine in here as well, very clean and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay, I am only giving them 4 stars because I had asked for the orange chicken to not be spicy and it was. Other than that the rest of the  food was delicious. They have  great lunch specials. Everything came with your choice of rice, soup and egg roll for $5.25. So much food! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We love the food here! The chicken wings are finger licking good! They're also serving wine and beer now which is a plus!"}
{"text":"This has become our go-to Chinese take out in fort mill. They're fast, great prices, and the food is consistently good. The sesame chicken and General Tsos chicken are our favorite. Very good!!"}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food. We order delivery quite a bit and they are quick and accurate. Great place!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant with Japanese Sushi thrown in to the mix.  Don't be put off by the small size, or that it is in a strip mall.  They have great portions and seriously good food."}
{"text":"A decent place for Chinese food in Fort Mill. Their quick and attentive staff deserve an extra star. The food itself is better than your average Chinese take out. My favorite dish is the shrimp in garlic sauce. A definite plus is that they serve alcohol. Food is moderately priced and larger than average portions."}
{"text":"Good Food, Clean, Better than Red Bowl, Great lunch specials. Nice staff. We eat here at least 5 times a month or more."}
{"text":"Good Asian takeout place !!  Good service and Food is average , but still I come here often as it's one of the very few restaurant which is opened after 9:30 PM in Fortmill ."}
{"text":"Very pleased with Peking Tokyo. I've had sushi here many times and it's always fresh and I've never had a bad roll. Their lunch specials are also a great deal. Quality is very high."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant around Ft Mill! Our favorites are the sweet and sour chicken, Szechuan chicken, and pepper steak. Good food and it's not expensive. They also deliver and it's a family owned restaurant. The family lives in Tega Cay, SC."}
{"text":"Make no mistake about it... This is by no means upscale food. It is typical American-Chinese food at a really cheap price. If that's what you want, this is the best place in the area to get it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! 

The staff is always friendly and provides great service. 

The food is very good and you won't go away hungry with the generous portions they offer!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. I work in the same shopping center and they are so nice and courteous. Their sweet and sour chicken is super yummy as well. They have awesome lunch specials too! 3 sushi rolls for 11 dollars. You can count me in!"}
{"text":"Definitely cheap. Definitely large portions. The quality of the food however fell short of my expectations."}
{"text":"This place does not seem like much.  Just a small location in a strip mall, but I have found their egg drop soup is some of the best.  And unlike some places that are hit or miss, it is good all the time.

Mainly go here during lunch with coworkers for the lunch special and I have not been dissapointed.  

Good eats for under $10 after tip is good for me."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese in the fort mill area.  They actually have decent sushi as well for a reasonable price...you can get 20% off coupons in the mail via the valpak and the city magazine publication.  Good portions and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm becoming a frequent consumer here . I'm glad they aren't far from my new office location because I love me some yummy Asian food . This is your standard take out Chinese spot . They do serve some Japanese and Thai dishes but I just get the Chinese menu items . $6 for lunch specials that are a good portion , and quick .  I like that the food is not greasy, and there are tons of options . 

Now I'm not saying this is mind blowing Chinese food, I'm saying it's great service, which if you read my reviews I absolutely will appreciate , and the food is good . Not overly salty, not heavily oiled , and not bland . Can't count how many times we've grabbed a quick lunch on the go , but I haven't had one negative experience ."}
{"text":"Huge lunch portions & I have never had anything to complain about other than the wait because too many people know this is the best place for the money around. I just wish I could buy stock or co-own another location because this is how it should be done."}
{"text":"Agree with Lauren. Best Chinese/Japanese in the area. Sushi is excellent and better than Red Bowl. Take out orders are huge and low cost. Try the Triple Delight chef special. Hot  and sour soup has a nice bang to it. We have ordered from there four times in last two months. Although they are next door to the defunct Mamma Theresa pizza and previous Italian specialty store, these folks will be in business for a long time."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi on Friday night.  Shrimp in shrimp tempura very small and only one.  One piece of  the roll was just the tail and no meat.  Salmon avocado roll was not bad, but avocado was not ripe.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and the food was outstanding. I travel America every week on business and at least once a week order Chinese delivery. This was some of the best I have had. Next time I am in Ft. Mill I will order again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Asian food in Ft Mill. Quick service and good food at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This place is average at best.  I am surprised by the amount of rave reviews.  I have been here three times and have never had anything close to great.  The people are nice here but I will probably give it some time before I return.

This review is based on Chinese food only."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Chinese. Pleasant atmosphere, welcoming staff, and great food. The moo goo gai pan is outstanding. The fried tofu is really good!  Portion sizes are large. And the sushi is consistently very, very fresh and good."}
