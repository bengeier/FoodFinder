{"text":"If you're looking for an over-priced shawarma plate, you've found the perfect place. Ask the kind staff to drench the chicken in tzatziki if you don't want to choke to death. A must-miss experience."}
{"text":"The food is great for food court (sorry, food hall) fare, but service is another story.  I've been to Kebaberie three times, and the same gentleman of a certain age served me.  I don't know what the issue is - perhaps it is cultural - but he seemed cranky each time, as if what I was ordering was it \"quite right.\"  But it could have just been my interpretation.  I'm at Yorkville Village A LOT, but I don't go to Kebaberie too often because I feel that the service just isn't quite there.  If he had been just a little happier..."}
{"text":"Yep, 5 stars. Like another reviewer, the owner seems cranky, but he's really not. Just a dude with a dry sense of humour. He made sure to tease me when I ordered my shawarma \"Greek style\" instead of Lebanese. He must be Lebanese. :)

I generally do not eat shawarma because I find the meat to be weird (tough pieces or simply low quality). One day, while ordering a salad, I got a good look at the meat and was intrigued. Since that day, I've eaten there almost 2x per week for lunch. 

The food is fresh and the meat is tops. The beef is high quality and juicy so I find I switch back and forth between chicken and beef. The helpings are generous and the price is good. I used to always get the shawarma plates, but it really is too much food for lunch so I now stick to the wrap. The pita they use is delightfully chewy as it should be. 

Highly recommend!  If you order the shawarma plate, ask for half chicken and half beef - best of both worlds. Don't forget the garlic sauce and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Yorkville. Their shawarma plate is off the hook; the onions alone are worth ordering. Clean, efficient and (most importantly) fresh, great food. My favourite lunch spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shawarma. It was delicious. They have variety of options including kebabs and shawarma plate. Great place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"If someone said amazing Schwarma and Yorkville together in the same sentence you wouldn't believe them, and you shouldn't. Very underwhelmed at this place. Decent food court schwarma at best. Meat was dried out. If you are craving Schwarma and are in Yorkville and have no desire to stray far it's ok. Otherwise I'd take a quick stroll to Yonge street and get something better."}
