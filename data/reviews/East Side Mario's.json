{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!

Seriously gross. I am not a food snob and I truly enjoy some good cheap comfort food once in a while. However, this food was barely edible. I would really be surprised to learn if they even had a real kitchen back there. Everything from the soup to the spaghetti tasted like it was out of a can. The tomato soup tasted like alphagetti sauce. I ordered the spaghettini and meatballs - the noodles were extremely overcooked and mushy. The sauce tasted very similar to the tomato soup - like a can of globby alphagetti. The \"meatballs\" were the consistency of the weird meat you get at Subway (nothing against Subway) - very spongy in texture. Not what you expect when you order meatballs at an Italian restaurant, even if it is a family friendly one.

I came here with my family because we were tempted by the \"buy one meal and get one free\" deal. DO NOT make the same mistake we did. Our \"meals\" were thrown out because they were unedible. I ordered a penne primavera to take home - it was a few plain noodles with a side of oil and about 3 thin slices of zucchini. We thought it would be great to be economical and save money by getting a free meal to take home (why not, right?) Here's my lesson of the day: IF A MEAL IS COMPLETELY FREE, IT IS PROBABLY WORSE THAN AIRPLANE FOOD. And it was. Honestly disgusting - I can't stress that enough. And this is coming from someone who will eat anything.

Finally, the service was atrocious. If the staff are reading this now, you all need some serious lessons in customer service. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years so I know how this stuff works. I won't bore you with the details, but essentially expect to feel like you are surrounded by people who have never been to a restaurant before, let alone worked in one. After waiting 20 minutes to be seated, we were not greeted at our table for another 20. The restaurant was not busy. At all. Looking over at the hosts/hostesses (there were 3), they were all chatting away with each other. So we went and asked someone to get our server since no one had come by our table. A few minutes later our server comes to the table and immediately says \"I'm a bit flustered right now\". That was it. Not sorry, or an explanation, just that he was flustered. Again, the restaurant is not busy. One of us mumbles \"umm, ok.. sorry to hear that\", and then we order a bunch of water.

There's no point in offering \"all you can eat soup/salad and bread\" if you don't check up on your tables to see if they need more.

Someone at our table complained about the wait and the service, and from that moment on, 3 or 4 different people came by our table several times to check if everything was good. We didn't tell them the food was terrible, but hopefully they figured this based on the amount of food that was left on the table when we left. Here's some customer service advice: when someone complains to you about bad service, it does NOT help to have several of your staff check on the table constantly. It's annoying. Give a genuine apology and perhaps dock the bill so your customers are inclined to return.

I am not an avid Yelp reviewer and I do not agree with rude people who post negative comments just for the fun of it. However, this restaurant deserves a 1 star review and everyone needs to know it. 

 Stay far away. There are better restaurants for the same price. The draw to this place used to be the prices, which are not even cheap anymore. Now the food is around the same price as some real italian restaurants. It's a shame. I wish I had listened to the other reviews on this page before visiting.

To the East Side Mario staff at this restaurant, I feel so bad that you have to work in this industry and don't even get the benefits of being around yummy food. If you just tighten up your service, your restaurant maybe still has hope. Bad food AND bad service? You're gone. Bad food but mediocre service? More likely to stick around. But, duh."}
{"text":"I came here last night with two friends to watch the hockey game. It was packed, and we were seated at a high-table in the bar area (we really wanted a booth, but the wait was 15-20 minutes). 

Our servers, Andrea and Alex, tended to our every need! A booth opened up about 15 minutes after we sat down, and Alex moved all our stuff for us, which was so sweet of them.

For food, one of my friend's sandwiches were burnt, and Andrea took it back three times until the kitchen had it done exactly the way my friend wanted it. My food (bow tie pasta with Rose sauce) was a little cold, but didn't bother me too much. Andrea kept coming back to our table to check whether we needed refills or more bread.

Overall, I'm giving four stars because of the servers, not the food. I was so happy with the attention we received from them, especially Andrea - she did everything she could to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"East Side Mario's has great food, but the service at this location isn't always up to par."}
{"text":"I love East Side Mario's but this location was the worst...restaurant I have ever been to!! The host was a bit eccentric but that wasn't the issue until I told him that we were ready to order, after being seated for 15 minutes with no one to check on us. He freaked out a little and said he doesn't take any orders and that our server would be with us very shortly. Another 5-10 minutes passed, I stopped another server and asked for our server because we were ready to order. Few mins later she came by with bread told us our server was still busy (for the past 30+ minutes) and ONLY took our drink orders. My friend and I chatted some more finished, we finished bread and another 10+ minutes passed...we still haven't gotten our drinks or our server.  At this point we've waited for over 40 minutes and we decided to leave. The shittiest part was we watched 2 tables that came after us got serviced before we did. 

Don't recommend this location, will never go back! And I work in food and beverage lol!"}
{"text":"How this place is still open is beyond me. Service is horrendous even though no one is in the restaurant. I stopped in for a beer with some friends, sat in the bar area and it took around 15 mins for our first pitcher to come to us ... we may have been the only other table at the bar. Couple at the table next to us sent back their food two or three times.
Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"This is a local favourite. Always busy, atmosphere is modern Italian and fun.  Entree's come with all you can eat soup, salad and bread. I had the Chicken Parmesan and it was huge!  Probably the best Chicken Parmesan I've ever tasted.  My wife had a pasta called \"Amatriciana\" and was in heaven.  The pasta was linguine tossed in a tomato/cream sauce with bacon, mushrooms, mixed peppers and chicken. Our server was excellent. His name was Tim. He was professional, funny and very attentive.  Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. All kids meals get a colouring book with NEW crayons, a free drink, gelato ice cream and a toy. Prices are below comparable restaurant averages. Meals are quick, tasty and the service is very good. This restaurant wins every time because the meals come with all you can eat salad, soup and bread.  Well worth the money try the tetrazini."}
{"text":"It is nice to see that this place has cleaned up its overall quality. Good food. Host is a nice fellow. Place looks good."}
{"text":"If I could rate this lower then 1 star I would
Where do I begin 
We walked in and waited like 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us (me my wife and my 2 kids)
We get to our seat and we're asked within 5 mins if we're ready to order not what we would like to drink, we had to ask for the bread.  The kids were excited because it was superhero day, we asked about it they said we're not doing anything for that, even though it was advertised all throughout the restaurant.  We all order our food comes out for me my wife and one kid, the waiter says it will be a few more mins, 5 mins go by and I ask for my sons pizza.  He tells us again 2 mins, then after 2 minutes he come back and says \"I have to be honest with you we forgot to make it....... I got my family up and told them (the waiter and the manager which we had asked for) were leaving and not paying for anything 
They just apologized and said it was ok
Like as if they could have said anything else!   Bottom line........ THIS PLACE SUCKS super unorganized services suck
I wouldn't send my worst enemy here"}
{"text":"I usually like east sides but tried their take out tonight and was very disappointed they gave us the wrong pasta and my chicken parmigian had barely any cheese on it this was after waiting 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge that I was trying to pick my food up don't bother with take out from here you'll be very disappointed"}
{"text":"Service is awful! Was seated for 15 minutes and had to write my own order. 20 minutes later only served bread and water. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but the past two years specially after renovations the quality of the food has gone down the drain. We still go back every once in a while cause it's walking distance to our house and my toddler loves pasta but every time we get disappointed! It's actually much tastier and cheaper to go to longos and get food from the hot meal section. Their foods amazing!"}
{"text":"I love it
very nice food, and nice starters too
It's not so Italian, its more of an American style italian"}
{"text":"One of the better chains we've been to this summer with excellent customer service! Food is good.. But with the great service makes everything taste much better."}
{"text":"Well, I should have been worried after the half cold, half hot calamari diavolo that I tried. It was rubbery but some what tasty and at 12.99 I wasn't going to waste it. I ordered the veal Parmesan as the main course and when it arrived it was inedible.  It had been fried to the point that it was burnt around the edges and I could snap it in half like a cracker. The waitress seemed incredulous that I found this unacceptable but offered me something else from the menu. So I tried the chicken parm. It was thicker so I thought the kitchen staff wouldn't have any issues cooking it. Bzzzt. Wrong. It was almost as crispy as the veal, and the parts that weren't burned had no flavor other than unseasoned breading.  As if that weren't bad enough, the pasta sauce tasted like it came straight from a can.  I won't be back. Ps. They did take the meal off the bill, but the guy representing himself as the manager acted as if he couldn't care less about my food issues and never apologized, just saying he would talk to his kitchen staff. Yeah, right."}
{"text":"The food was okay...I had the spaghetti and meatballs for 12$. The meatballs were tasteless and dry, and the spaghetti was crunchy in some areas. The waitress Vanessa was helpful and seemed to manage her tables efficiently and quickly. However it is a family oriented place and I don't suggest going for dates there."}
{"text":"My family and I went here hoping for some good Italian food. My husband ordered the penne and peppers with a Caesar salad. What he received was unidentified rubbery animal \"sausage\", and Caesar salad with a chunk of bacon that had been coagulated in it's own fat. My dish, the chicken tetrazzini, looked like barf- and did not taste much better. It was watery and the chicken looked like someone put tofu (or a tapeworm) in my food- inedible! My three year kept things simple with chicken strips and fries. Unfortunately those were so overcooked she just ate her sweet and sour sauce. The best part was the gelato pop they give at the end of a kids meal and my husbands beer. The waitress never asked us how our meal was- probably knows not to open that can of worms. East Side Mario's- bada bing, bada BAD!"}
{"text":"A half-bottle of Pepto-Bismol later... I quite regretted trying their gut-bombs on a plate."}
{"text":"Our dance team hosted their end of year party at East Side's last night and they were Ah-Mazing!!!
They came in at budget with an amazing amount and assortment of food for kids and adults alike.   Staff were GREAT: friendly, attentive to the needs of everyone in our group and most of all professional.
The manager Sylvia, made me look like a hero for planning this event, but the secret is - she put it all together for us!
Thank-you to Joe and Sylvia for an evening none of us will forget!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a small Make Your Own Pizza with pepperoni, bacon, and goat cheese, but I GOT a pepperoni pizza. It was still really good, but not what I ordered.

Also, the server ignored me completely, and kept asking my dad, \"is everything all right, sir?\""}
{"text":"Love this place. Chicken Parmesan is the best dish I've had. Huge portion, unlimited salad and fresh baked bread to start are always welcomed. Great service and atmosphere, love the sports bar in a family restaurant setting. Pizza isn't bad, but a little heavy on the sauce, also toppings should be on top of the cheese like in the pictures. Crust could be thinner like real Italian style. However the Chicken Parmesan makes it all okay.. Order this"}
{"text":"It was not a particularly busy night, the bar area was maybe half full. It took at least 30 mins for a server to even acknowledge us and another to 15 to bring water and take our order. A person from our table had to actually get up and ask for our server multiple times before we could even place our order. Overall it took 45 mins to 1 hr to get our order in. Another hour and food did not come. By the end of our visit, it had been about 2 hours and one of the people we were with had to go home. We took our food to-go. They gave us 50% off our meal which was the only nice thing. When I ate the food at home it wasn't even good. It was bland. The customer service: other than the fact that we waited during our entire approx. 2 hour visit, the server did not seem particularly pleased to serve us and only made some small talk about why it took so long when we paid the bill. I can understand that it may be hard to forcast traffic on a particular night for staffing reasons but how does one do SUCH a bad job that customers are waiting almost TWO hours and the food is not even there? Prior to this visit I had been to this location 2 other times and those experiences were not pleasant either so I dont think this visit was a \"one-off\" situation. I highly recommend to NOT come here."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for Victoria's day. It took a few minutes to get seated even though there were numerous tables empty but we brushed that off because it seemed like they didn't have a hostess/host at the moment to greet and seat us.

When we were seated, we ordered our food but ended up getting our food before our drinks. We had to ask three times for our waters. Usually at a restaurant, drinks should come out first so that was the first red flag.

When our pastas arrived, they were overly oily and the pasta was overcooked. It was also soggy. The food was rather disappointing as well as the service. This location was really dusty and dirty.

Overall, my family and I most likely won't be returning to this location. The location in Brampton at Trinity Commons is the one we usually frequent and it is so much better."}
{"text":"Very accommodating and friendly! It is a very good east side marios. We came here for lunch after a rainstorm and they opened up the patio for us!"}
{"text":"I was curious to come here after one of my yelp friends posted such a wonderful review and she was right! The dessert is soooo good. Great service and everything tastes fresh. Plus it's an easy night out on the wallet. I really hope this place stays open. It's so hard to decide what to eat it all looks so wonderful."}
{"text":"Fast courteous service.  Nice menu.
Taste was alright.
Terrible food poisoning 10 hours later!
I never get food poisoning but if you MUST go here please avoid their salad-chicken combos!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst \"Italian food\" you'll ever encounter.  Their fake NYC Lower East Side decor shouldn't fool you. There is nothing Italian or even edible here. Unnecessarily over priced, poor service and general disorganization will leave you regretting your choice."}
{"text":"Keep giving this place a chance and the food just sucks even with the new menu. How hard is it to provide good quality Italian food?  This wannabe Olive Garden just disappoints."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews or negative ones but this place had the worst service. Way too slow to be seated (despite being empty) and it took far too long for the food. No one seemed rushed or concerned at all, even when sharing this news with a manager. The food for the kids took forever. It was ultimately burnt in one case and had to be redone (a simple pizza for kids). My daughter ate alone as we were all done after her 40 minute wait. Wasted hours here for nothing. Don't go to this location."}
{"text":"We popped into here for lunch after Christmas shopping in the mall. My friend and I both ordered soup and salad, how could you go wrong? Well, the minestrone soup was very bland, 2 beans in the whole bowl. The salad was tired and the dressing was not Italian, just tasted very 'herby'. With a diet coke and a sparking water, our bill came to  $30. Definitely will not go back there."}
{"text":"Terrible in every way possible. I went to this location and ordered a half mariboli wrap, with soup and a salad. The soup was cold, the lettuce in the wrap was brown, and the mariboli wrap was cold. Ive ordered this from other locations dozens of times, and never did it come to my table like this. Total pig-slop, half assed cooking techniques. Awful. The waitress was even ignoring us and drinking beer on the job, and we waited 30 minutes for refills, and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Actually haven't been to an East Side Mario for a long time, so I wasn't sure if it can still be decent. The price did seem to jump a bit, but they probably charge that much because of the 'all you can eat salad and drink soup'

I ordered the 'Scallop Carbonara which is in alfredo sauce on linguine pasta with bacon scallops and scallops. The pasta was cooked right, and the scallops tasted fine (frozen).

My gf got the 'Chicken Parmiagiana'. This is a dish that usually can't go wrong in a so-called Italian joint, and fortunately it didn't. The chicken was a good hand size portion served with penne pasta, but both meals were close to $40 before tax. 

Service is good, because we did go on a slow day. I'd probably eat at this place again, but not for a good long time again."}
{"text":"Reserved ahead for lunch with our daughter's hockey team. Total disaster!!!  Staff were not prepared at all for a large group and did not have any idea how to serve a team.  Do not come to this restaurant unless you have 3 hours to kill and have packed a picnic."}
{"text":"The food is bland and the service is slow. I went there a few times but I won't go there any more.

It's also not kids friendly. They won't let you use their microwave to heat baby food. I had to drive 2km to the nearest McDonald's to heat my child's food in the microwave because the manager of the restaurant won't let me use their microwave!"}
{"text":"I came in with my mom as they were having a special. They had 12 different items for $12 each and that included all you can eat salad or soup and garlic loaf. I had a create your own pasta dish with penne, chicken and their classic tomato sauce. Mom had another dish which had spicy but not too spicy sausage, chicken and peppers and was served over rice. She said it was delicious. Service here is usually a hit or a miss and there's almost always a line up and yesterday was no exception. The wait was only about 5 minutes though. Our service was wonderful and the food came out quickly and was fresh. They loose a star for the noise level but for a full family restaurant that's expected. For the quality of food and the value this place is definitely worth a try if you have time to wait in line. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered an arabbiata chicken w pasta dish for dinner... got  food poisoning. The ensuing 8 hours is definitely amongst the worst nights of my life."}
{"text":"Really really bland food and burnt. My group of friends were having an reunion but Lone Star wasn't open so we went across the street to this place. We were the only group of guests there but they still managed to not serve salad and soup for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"These chains are all over-priced really, but East Side Mario's is one of the better ones. Their chicken parmesan is delicious and their pizza ain't that bad either.

It's also a good place to grab a beer and some of their garlic bread while watching the hockey game in the lounge side. Their beer is always cold and fresh and served in a frosted mug.

The service can be spotty, but overall, Mario's is alright with me."}
{"text":"Good service but food barely edible. Our British accented waitress was charming and attentive. The salad was wet with the lettuce in pieces sized for an elephant to eat. Bread was okay. The pasta was uneventful. There was no flavour to the Fettuccine Alfredo. The sauce was like a soup. The noodles were not cooked. My partner had the Spaghetti and Meatballs. He said the meatballs were full of filler and held little meat.
We will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ambiance of the place is good, Pizza is average and Pasta tastes like canned food.This is place is Ok to hang arnd for Drinks."}
{"text":"waiting there for 40mins?other people came after us ?they all get table .  the servise were so poor???they dont accept any complaint? we finally decided to leave? after we walk out the door?one of the waiter ?a big guy open the door ?shouting at us?we are just 3 mother with 3 kids?? that was very rude? so horrible??never go again. you never know what are they going to add in your food?"}
{"text":"Wait staff was great. Started with Salad on my last bite found a piece of wax paper.  They brought out the rest of our food, after we finished eating slightly burnt pizza and pasta. Server apologized and asked if I wanted to talk to manager.  I asked the Server to let the manager know.  She came back and told me the manager apologizes and gave me the bill.  I asked if she let the manager know about the wax paper and she replied again we apologize and that's all we can do.  The wax paper was a turn off and the manager could have apologized in person.  Will not go back again."}
{"text":"DONT GO THERE 
I've been here before and the service and food wasn't bad, but the second time was terrible. 
The manager  doesn't know exactly what's going on"}
{"text":"Love the new menu! So many choices and the unlimited bread with soup or salad makes it a go to restaurant for my family of 5 ;) My only tip is be sure to ask for extra sauce as they seem to skimp. Finally saved up enough room to share a funnel cake with my boys!! Yummy like Wonderland but sooo much cheaper! Also read coupons carefully as most are from sun-thurs..which sucks on a saturday lol! Overal a tasty experience with good service!"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!

Let me start off by saying that my Hubby and I have been coming to ESM for the past 6 without fail, on our anniversary. We just enjoyed the atmosphere and food. However, after a HORRIBLE experience here last FRIDAY, we wont be back. At least not to this location. Let me point out what went wrong.

1) The host was rude. We asked for a booth, he said there was none available and sat us in the middle of the restaurant. We then figured to ask him how long the wait time would be for a booth. He asked\"  Where are your menus?\" As if we were supposed to know that a booth was available and that we had to set the table. He had a very rude tone of voice and not one smile.

2) My hubbys favourite dish (rotisserie chicken with potatoes), which he orders every time we go here, was taken off the menu understand this is not any ones fault but it added to the terrible experience.

3)The waitress was extremely un attentive. We were served out salad, in the big salad bowl, without any accompanying salad plates. I did not get a napkin. We had to ask for these things. How long does it take one to see that a customer has no napkins or plates??!?!?! did she expect us to eat from the bowl together???!?!

4) My hubbys water glass was left empty for 20mins, until we asked both our waitress and the bus boy for water.

5) When we had finished our salad and bread (unlimited), we were not asked if we would like refills.

6) My hubbys \"medium rare\" steak was served well done with charred bits on it. Lovely.

7) My chicken cannelloni looked like it was prepared by an infant. The sides of the plate was marked with sauce drops, the cherry tomatoes which were thrown on top were all cut in different sizes and the basil that was sprinkled on top was all on the left side of the plate. I'm no Gordon Ramsey but it just looked like no care was taken with  presentation.

8) We were not asked if we would like freshly grated cheese on our main dishes or our salad, which is what they usually do. When I asked our waitress why we didn't get any, she replied \"Oh we have changed our policy so that the guest has to ask for cheese in order to get it. People think I'm not doing my job but its just policy.\" WHAT A LOAD OF BS!!!! I then replied \"Do we also have to ask for refills on salad?\" to which she replied \" Yah..umm..occasionally\". Right!

9) Our waitress asked \"How was your meal\", very half heartedly. To which I responded \"Not so great\" and then she smiled awkwardly/nervously and walked off. Great service. She asked again when we were paying the bill and I explained our situation and she said she was sorry. WOW



ANYWAYS. I will not be back to this location and have emailed the management. If nothing is done to redeem themselves I will just boycott this place completely.

THE END."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go to if you love all you can eat garlic bread and soup/ salad! They have a large variety of $12.99 pasta and entrée options available, as well as regular priced menu items which are around $15 to $20. All come with unlimited garlic bread and soup/ salad.

You can pretty much get 2 meals from here since you can pack the entrée to go. The garlic bread was great, not as good as Olive Garden imo, but it's the closest deal you can get in town (please correct me if I'm wrong! Would love to know where else in the hood has unlimited garlic bread!). The Italian wedding soup and caesar salad were pretty good as well. Just need to go a little bit lighter on the seasoning and dressing. But again it's unlimited so can't complain there.

The server was pretty attentive and food arrived in a timely manner. Portions are very generous. It was also a friend's birthday so he got the whole East Side birthday chant from the servers and we order him a funnel cake to sub for the free chocolate cake. The funnel cake (~$7) was a bit over fried and whip cream tasted funny, so I would opt out of that. He also got to spin the wheel for a prize (It landed in the middle between free lunch or toy, so he got to choose either or and he chose the toy lol).

Overall great experience and great value. Would definitely be coming back for more garlic bread, seriously who can say no to that?"}
{"text":"Small servings of pasta put in a huge plate. Tiny chicken wings. While still eating, the waitress was removing empty plates from our table, which is kinda rude. Unlimited salad and soup but we were served only once."}
{"text":"This review I started yesterday.  Before I hammered them down, I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, by trying them once more.

From my past experiences here, none of them have ever been good.  It's a sad joke for an Italian franchise, wait, this is an Italian franchise right?  Because nothing here tastes Italian.

How do you go wrong with Salad? Seriously?  Mine came out like mush.  I ordered a chicken tettrazini, and I couldn't even swallow it, that's how dry it was.

After all was said and done, my friends and myself have agreed the best course of the meal was the candy at the end.  I just wish they would've given 2 per person, that way I wouldn't have felt like I wasted my time.

I went with a group of 4, and all 4 people ate a quarter or less of their meal.  That alone speaks volume.  Thank goodness for A&W across the street.  Chubby Chicken anyone?  Kinda fattening, but w/e!

Anyway, If I could give them 0 stars I would, however, it is defaulted to 1 star, and this 1 star I give to the very cute girl who served me.  This was the only positive thing about East Side Marios.  She was deserving of the tip, the place? not so much.

I have now permanently banned this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is horrible will never go back there again. Went there with a few friends and no one ate their food. Used to be better but has fallen off over the years."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service experiences - ever. I will not be going back and neither will the three adults who were with me. Let me start by saying that previous experiences have been mediocre but the service has been declining - and now to a new low. 

We arrived at 6 p.m. with two toddlers and (thankfully) ordered their food as we sat down. They children's food came 10 minutes later and that was the end of anything that could be remotely classified as \"service\".  We sat for over 30 minutes waiting to place our orders and place drink orders for the two adults who joined us 5 minutes after we sat down. Our waitress had completely disappeared so I asked the manager who was passing by if he could retrieve someone to place our to order, to which he replied \"yeah, yeah, yeah\" while not slowing as he walked away. Then, nothing. Ten minutes later we flagged down another waitress who told us to hold on and then returned saying there was an issue with the waitress and she would serve us. She was obviously annoyed and kept saying she was doing this as a \"favour\". She saw our coupons for $10 off a minimum order of $30 food and claimed that we probably couldn't use them and we should take it up with the original waitress?

Yet again, we waited and waited until I eventually got my starter Caesar salad that came to me soggy on a wet plate with dressing smeared on the side - it literally looked thrown together. Only then did we get our starter bread. One person at our table got her bowl of soup while the other didn't. Until 10 minutes later she was able to get someone's attention. Literally an hour and a half after we arrived none of us had our entrees. I waved down the waitress who was doing us the \"favour\" of her services and told her to cancel our order as my husband was outside with our toddler who lasted an hour and a half, but was now melting down. She ignored me and said \"yeah, it's coming\" at which point I stopped her and reiterated that I no longer wanted anything but my bill. And then the original waitress came by to confirm I'd be paying for my meal - which I never got! I told her I'd only be paying for the kid's meal. They handed me the pay terminal and walked away - so I had to print out my own bill and the merchant's copy! I paid and left hungry and without hearing a single word of apology. Two of our friends stayed to take their orders to go (supposedly ready at that point) only to wait another 15 minutes and have their orders mixed up and partly cancelled. 

Please don't go here. For a family restaurant you'd think they'd understand that an hour and a half wait is not acceptable with young children...or in a restaurant setting at all-especially for less-than-mediocre food."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service.  Annoying that I had to ask for everything from crayons for our 3 year old, water to drink for everyone and at the end I had to ask for the dessert that's part of the kids meal.  Shouldn't have to ask for these things-they usually just automatically bring them at all other family restaurants that I've been to. Don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"The food feels like it's all frozen microwaved. Nothing is authentic. Nothing is cooked in house. It's sad but
 management are running this fine name into the ground. The only plus is its cheap. But u pay for the airplane food you get I guess. Get your act together."}
{"text":"Good Service with Sub-Par Food
I only gave the place two stars because our server Poodle was really good. Can't say that about the food. Mediocre quality, kids pizza came almost uncooked at the edges with v thick bubbles of dough, the Street Eats we ordered was served cold, I don't think we'll return"}
{"text":"Our name was taken and we were given a buzzer said it would go off when our table was ready and that we could have a drink at the bar while we waited. 20 minutes later we noticed a table had been empty for awhile so my boyfriend went to see if we could have it. He was told we had already been seated, which we hadn't why would we be asking for a table if we had one? We were then told our name had been crossed off the list. When we finally got a table it took awhile to have our order taken. We also asked to passing waitresses for service for more drinks as we hadn't seen our waitress in awhile. Both those waitresses ignored us. When our waitress finally passed us she only then apologised for the wait on the food. We had noticed people who had arrived before us were already halfway through their meals. We were told the kitchen had a \"bungle up\". The food wasn't anything special, I had the parmy sandwich and my boyfriend had a pizzeroli thing. We do not feel the service was good at all. We still left a 10% tip but do not feel the wait staff, kitchen staff or the host who crossed off our name without seating us then told us we'd been seated, deserved any kind of tip. We will not be returning to east side mario's which is a shame, I was looking forward to try your restaurant for the first time. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not like the old days. The food generally is AWFUL, and the service can be spotty and done by inexperienced staff. I take the odd client there, so I do have to go a few times a year. But I think this is regurgitated Franchise Food with no passion, very little taste or seasoning, and it can stand a big-time improvement in this area. Not for me."}
{"text":"The food is just meh. Not worth the price. Their chicken, pasta, soup and salad were not worth the gas money.

Service can be spotty from poor to average. I think they lost their good waiters in the past because of bad management.

I'm guessing the Bar side is what's keeping this business afloat. I think they changed their name or something. I didn't care enough to check the sign when I was leaving."}
{"text":"With a name like East Side Mario's, I had envisioned a dark, humble Italian joint, ideally with herbal vapors emanating from the kitchen and mobsters conspiring in dark corners. I instead was confronted with the grim reality of a brightly-lit eyesore and surmise that a garage sale smeared itself on the walls, leaving a hideous befuddlement of flotsam and jetsam stuck there.

Our waiter was reminiscent of the annoying Joe Pesci character in the Lethal Weapon movies, a ceaseless amphetamine fueled chatterbox with no visible Off switch and an unawareness that we simply wanted our orders taken sans the life story. I kept wishing Riggs and Murtaugh would appear to nightstick this character back to the kitchen, or at minimum, someone else's table.

Disinclined to be falsely polite, I showed grossly uncharacteristic self-restraint by contorting my mouth into a rictus of artificial congeniality for the sake of my dinner companion. Somehow, we managed to work our orders in edgewise, immediately regretting our lack of judgment in neglecting to order something stronger than imported beer. Vigilant as a hyperactive mongoose, our waiter continued to stop by, interrupt our conversation and inject his unprofessional prattle of humorless jokes, pointless anecdotes and irrelevant real life stories told in real time. 

Occasionally, our waiter would begin backing away from our table while he was still talking, and I realized that this was his means of propulsion. Orally expelling vast quantities of air is how beings from his planet achieve locomotion.

Our pasta dishes were delivered on a torrent of verbiage, and were unmemorable. Powerless to simply talk and enjoy our time together, my date and I rapidly devoured our mediocre meals and requested the bill before our waiter had a chance to assault us with another extensive inane story. Just beyond the door came the sweet siren song of a marvelous land filled with freedom and peace. The parking lot. And, we eventually made it.

With the unremarkable food, and service that still makes me wake up screaming, I'd rather eat a bullet than eat at East Side Mario's again. I might be out of line in suggesting that Mario have his decorator and waiter whacked. Might be."}
{"text":"Slow service. Dust and cobwebs hanging from light in our booth. Hair in margarine and garlic bread. Seafood linguini at lunch served with 4 mussels... one of which was clammed shut and two were barely open. Bland meatballs in watery spaghetti sauce. Overworked wait staff. Friendliness of wait staff probably the only positive."}
{"text":"My cousin and i went for a few drinks and a meal, thinking hell why not its close by.  Don't bother.  We sat there, while 3 other tables that came 10-15 minutes later were served before us.  three servers all ignored us, finally we got a hold of someone and guess what...he was our server just Didn't know about it.  We got sub-par drinks and the lady across from us ordered a Vegetarian dish and got one with meatballs and the other with Seafood.  A total of 3 people were complaining around us.
So hey if you want to experience being ignored and treated like you have leprosy than feel free to hit this place up,
oh and as for the food, my chicken parm was dry as an ashy elbow on a summer day. 
Yeah...No thank you."}
{"text":"This location is right outside of Markville Mall, but parking should be relatively easy to find. When I entered the restaurant it was quite empty and the other times that I have visited have been similar experiences.

Even though prices have gone up, I find that the food is still quite good value especially considering that most meals include unlimited garlic loaf and choice of soup or salad (if you have two people, have one choose soup and the other salad so you can share). 

The reason why this is three stars is the superior Olive Garden chain in the United States. Portions here are slightly smaller and variety on this menu is small. I ordered the build your own pasta for $14.99 with fettuccine, meatballs, and alfredo sauce. I recommend ordering meatballs because they are the best value, even though they are frozen like everything else here. The picture provided shows portion size, which left me quite full after all the homeloaf and soup. It also tasted decent and I was satisfied with the quality here.

Service: 4/5

3.5/5 but leaning to 3"}
{"text":"This place has steadily declined in quality that it has become a shell of its former self from the three times I have visited (counting the most recent). With the sign outside alleging the establishment was under new management I figured things may have turned around and was worth a shot, unfortunately that is not the case. In fact, it is baffling that during my third and most recent visit it was busy, only to be dismayed in the quality of the food. Bottom line, the food they cooked was inconsistent, which can only spell a deeper systemic problem for the restaurant. For the meal, I ordered the Italian wedding soup and Riso Italiano. The soup itself was too salty with both the lentils and meatball too mushy or soft to feel right; as though it was either under-cooked or left to warm for too long. As for the Riso Italiano, it's actually embarrassing to think they could've messed up cooking rice but they did, the rice was under-cooked or hard (grit like even) and the chicken was severely shrunken as if blasted by heat (microwaved perhaps?). Do not be fooled by the free refill on bread, salad or soup they offer (or what ever they tout it as); clearly they are compensating for the lack of quality control in the kitchen, as well as the budget cut through this cheap tactic as a means to mask their problems by filling your stomach quickly. Additionally, the menu is super bloated with options, if the management is looking to cut the budget and trying to compensate with flashy menus or deals, sadly that is not the way to go.The only thing they served right was the bread, which is sad. I sincerely hope they can end this restaurants misery and shut it down as the server who served us, as well as any one else in the building for the fact of the matter, were too kind to be working in a establishment such as this. For your sanity and consideration, please avoid this restaurant at all cost. The most basic and easiest rule a restaurant must live by is to serve a deceptively simple parred down menu using only the most freshest ingredients, not number pushers with their marketing tactics."}
{"text":"My first time there in over 5 years. The soup, salad and bread was great as always. But when the entrees came they LOOKED good. Actually the entrees were very bland and lacked presentation. Especially when you order seafood you should be given sliced of lemon on the side. Service was ok. I will not be coming back. Frankie tomatoes here I come........."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, the drinks were decent. Every thing else pretty bad, ordered Budda boomers that came to the table still uncooked, ended up breaking one and then sending it back. They refried the same ones and sent it back.. a new low for east side marios in my books..."}
{"text":"Terrible service, made us wait for 30 minutes before seating us at tables without cutlery or plates. The food was served before cutlery and we weren't given any until asked. All you can eat bread and salad was never restocked even after asking twice. Food was below par, greasy and un appetizing. No one bothered to come around with the cheque for the longest time possible. Don't bother coming here unless you are really hungry and there's no food for miles. Would have given negative stars if possible."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! 
I went there today and ordered hells kitchen chicken and found beef meat balls in it. When I complained the waiter and management had nothing to say. Manager indeed admitted that stuff does fall into food once in a while. I wonder what else falls in food. I will lodge a formal complaint to health department to inspect their kitchen."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in a long time, but I was reminded of it just recently when I read Katie C's review of the location on MacLeod Trail. Like Katie, I'm not really a fan. Combining one negative experience and a great mix of mediocre ones tends to leave me a bit cold towards East Side Mario's.

I don't find the food terrible, and there are definitely a couple of ringers on their menu (their garlic bread is awesome, and I have enjoyed their Seafood Linguine), but I do take exception when I find unappetizing extras hidden in my food; have you ever discovered a daddy-longlegs in your Caesar salad? Yeah. Turns you right off your meal. And while I don't blame the serving staff for this kind of mix-up, I would have appreciated it if they had done something to kind of ease the ensuing culinary tension. Our waitress just sort of blinked in bemusement and asked if we wanted to order another salad. This gives you a hint towards their general standard of service as well.

Top this off with the fact that you're paying over or around $20 a meal (with drinks, but not including dessert), and I'm definitely more inclined to just cook for myself, at home. It's not like I'd be missing the ambiance, either. The only great thing about this East Side Mario's is its proximity to other businesses, like Sunridge Spectrum, Chapters, and - oh yeah - a lot of other restaurants."}
{"text":"Make sure you're being served by Gina.
Great appetizers
Havent really tried their main course stuff.
Any appetizer goes well with their pitchers of beer.
I suggest the garlic parm chicken wings."}
{"text":"I like this place because the food is tasty and the service is above average (depending on who you get), there was one time when one of the servers was rude to me I asked her for dipping sauce for my pizza and she said NO we don't have any, she didn't check she didn't let me finish my sentence and I don't know why she was so grumpy or why she couldn't take a second to go check, we were the only customers in the store and im sure she didn't have anything better to do because when we came in she was playing with her nails. so, im definitely staying away from her! I think her name was crystal ? or kristel ? Other than that I've always been happy when I come and happier when I leave with lots of food in my belly. YUM YUM YUM :) 
they really should get more staff though, I find that on days like Friday we have to wait really long for our food, and I understand that its hard to be quick during rush hours but things could go a lot smoother with more staff.

food = 4/5
service = 4/5
cleanliness = 4/5"}
{"text":"I was happy to see them open a location close to me and was looking forward to trying lunch. I really miss the Olive Garden and this looked like it would something similar. Between the two us we ordered 1 draft beer, I appetizer, chicken parm,veal parm.  The parms  were excellent but the pasta was just so so. I didn't think the serving size was vey big,just average. It was nice to get the unlimited bread and salad which were both pretty good. The problem was with total bill. 75.00 with tip. That is just way too expensive even if you can bring the leftovers home. I won't be back for that reason."}
{"text":"I can't believe that we ordered 2 pizzas and a dish of spaghetti. After 1h and 5 mins they finally delivered the order. For one pizza they forgot to add the tomato sauce and for the other one they added something we didn't order. We asked to correct the pizzas. Another 20 to 25 minutes for them to correct one pizza and to provide the sauce for the order.

If you want to wait 1 hr and 30 mins to get a simple  order (is it really that hard to provide 2 pizzas and a dish of spaghetti?) this is the place to go."}
{"text":"To call the food served at East Side Mario's, \"Italian Food\" is an insult to real Italian Restaurants everywhere.  It is like processed fast food, over cheesy, greasy, pre- prepared.  I have no other words besides Nasty!  They are lucky to be located where they are, or they would be empty.  I wish people would hold these restaurants up to certain standards.  Go check out a real Italian restaurant; give someone the business that deserves your hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this place. If you want to have a good day , avoiding this place is step one."}
{"text":"i made an order over the phone. after 20 minutes they called me up and said if i want to pick up my order at the restaurant because they have no drivers. i said no and i cant drive there. they said they will cancel the order. next day i saw a charge to my credit card over and above what the total was on the phone and i called them up and they said it takes 72 hours to reverse it into my credit card. the place is poorly managed and a big food chain like that should know that around lunch time you need to have enough drivers for delivery and there is more calls and orders. i would not recommend ordering over the phone with them. very dissatisfied and will not even visits their restaurants either until they have a change of management and restructuring of how the company is run."}
{"text":"I've been to this location when I was younger, but now a days, most East Side Mario's seems lifeless.. The decor is out dated, and the picture frames dusty.. As for the food,I got the goat cheese chicken. The chicken was small & dry, the whole plate was filled with dried veggies also.. Mom some sort of chicken rose linguini that was mediocre as well.. 1 star for service & salad though :)"}
{"text":"Bye bye East Side... looks like this chain is in freefall. After a terrible Take Out experience a few months ago (based on under training and under staffing) we went in for supper. 

First, they have killed their Coca-Cola deal for one with Pepsi. Never a good idea to give up the Number One Supplier for the Number Two - looks like Pepsi gave them a great loss leader deal just to stiff Coke, knowing that it won't last long, so it won't cost them that much. 

Second, portion size is slashed by at least half on the lasagna (you can have the second half back for an extra $5 - basically taking the cost of the original size meal up by over a third).

Third, the taste is off. Using cheaper ingredients and less skilled staff can do that.

Fourth, table service was terrible. So that's take out service and table service that have taken a bad hit.

All of this points to a desperate dive to the bottom, slashing costs and portion size and service level to an totally unacceptable level, to try to stay alive. 

Bye Bye East Side, it was good while it lasted but we done now. 

R.I.P."}
{"text":"Not Impressed.  

I haven't ever had a truly amazing experience at an East Side Mario's but this was particularly bad.  It was a quiet Monday night and our guests wanted to go to a reliable chain restaurant, this being their suggestion, so out we headed.  

On arrival we were greeted by teenagers in very slopped very wrinkled white shirts and handed menus - with four inserts apiece.  It was a very awkward greeting as we fumbled with menus towards our booth.  

My guy and I usually enjoy their sizzling calamari al diavolo appetizer and we enthusiastically ordered it again only this time the calamari was soggy and lifeless.  As the waitress put down the little cast iron skillet, another staff member was shouting at her about something or other and she was yelling back across the restaurant (which certainly wasn't packed).  Not 45 seconds after our appetizer was served our mains followed.  I cannot describe how irritating I find that.  I realize that food should be served quickly, but I hate being barraged by plates and generally feeling rushed.

My main was a chicken alfredo dish which was rather tasteless.  The sauce was under seasoned and the noodles claggy.  

I won't be returning any time soon."}

{"text":"Pizza with caramelised onion & feta. Sounds good. The onion was pale & still crunchy. The feta looked exactly like mozzarella, to be honest. Feta doesn't melt that way. And how hard is it to properly caramelise onions en masse earlier in the day while prepping other things to have at the ready for using later? Or just call them \"barely sautéed onions.\" 

The salad was fine. Exactly as always. Desserts are usually thawed alright."}
{"text":"Waited about 15 to be served, after one of many servers that walked past me asked if I need a seat I was taken to my table, fast table service made me forget about the 15 minute wait , and then the bomb hit , the food arrived , what a slap in the face to Italian cuisine, my wife had pasta that had microwaved chicken in it (subway chicken) that looked more like a soup then a pasta , my burger was not brought to me as described on the menu , it should have said 2 frozen patttys served between and oversized bun with awful strip bacon on it"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the restaurant owner is even worst. We ordered one soup/salad and chicken, after long time they came back saying no half chicken only quarter available. My wife asked for another salad refill but they refused. Restaurant owner shows up careless so we left and we will never come back......."}
{"text":"This restaurant had amazing food. And the staff were very nice and personable. I had the burger and it was the best burger I ever had! I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the Mississauga area"}
{"text":"Attention Tourists. DONT GO HERE. This place is only in business because of you and it pains me that you still walk through the doors expecting a good experience. Ugh. The location right near the CN Tower and Convention Center is the only thing this place has going for it. 

Attending a Conference at the MTCC this week, with a team of 7 we had been allotted an hour and half between speakers to grab some lunch. An hour and a half should be plenty of time at 1pm for a sit down meal, especially if we choose somewhere that caters to \"lunch specials.\"

It had been a LONG morning and we were very hungry. We entered the doors and a server approaches us. The restaurant is nearly empty. He asks how many we are and goes to see what table he can. The (presumably) Manager comes up, asks how many we are and we tell him we are being taken care of. He says \"Yeah, that guy doesn't know anything\" grabs some menus and motions for us to follow.  We are seated right beside the open kitchen. 

Our server comes, grabs waters etc. The style of services is very casual. (Going Around the table) \"Water for me, water, water...\" *server interrupting* \"SO like who wants something that isn't water? He fetches the drinks and we order.

For anyone who doesn't know, the whole DEAL with East Side Marios is the endless salad and bread. I order \"Soup, Salad, Bread\" and my coworkers order various lunch specials. The first 3 tiny loaves come out with butter, and two bowls of wilted and lifeless salad and we dig in, starving. At least the server offered us parmesen for the Ceaser. The green salad is far worse than i remember, NO flavour on the iceburg lettuce at all. 

My soup arrives, less than a 4 ounce ladle of Campbell's style Minestrone complete with way overcooked pasta I am sure from several re-heatings.  I eat it in less than 2 minutes. It is supposed to be endless, so I will ask for another bowl. 15 min later the server comes by, brushing his sideswept bangs he confirms that I want another bowl of soup, and he might as well get us some more salad and bread. 

Soup comes, I eat it (4 ounces part 2) gazing at the two bowls of salad sitting on the warm counter in the kitchen (we are right beside the kitchen.) Servers are wandering by slowly as the restaurant is mainly empty. The manager walks buy, all seeing the bowls waiting to be run out, no one makes an effort. My OTHER-unfortunate-soup-ordering-coworker-as-ravenous-as-I-am jokes that he will fetch it himself. We finally get the salads, no bread. I ask for bread, it never comes, I'm hungry, giving server \"looks\" and we are running out of time. The server comes over to deposit a butter I asked for earlier (we have no bread at this point) and touches me warmly on the arm. Seriously.

We get the bill, my boss pays. I continue to grumble about bread and slowly begin to settle into the fact that I will be watching the afternoons set of presenters with 8 ounces of minestrone and some iceberg lettuce swishing in my stomach. We are late, as this entire experience took WELL over an hour.

My one smart coworker bounced to King St and had a lovely and enjoyable lunch elsewhere grr.

The food is horrible, the service is horrible, the bread is decent, if you can manage to get your hands on any. Avoid."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!

I ordered their sixteen-layered lasagna. When it came the plate itself was burning hot and the food was steaming, which was quite nice. However, as I ate through about one-third of it, I noticed the center of the lasagna was freezing cold. Clearly they have pre-packaged, frozen pieces that they reheat on the plate in the oven. When I called over the server to tell her, she asked me \"Did it just cool down?\" I thought that was ridiculous; I told her she could touch it and feel that it was frozen. She brought it back, I wasn't given a replacement, and all they did was give me $5.00 off. 

I didn't even get to finish my meal and they only gave me $5.00 off. Absolutely terrible customer service."}
{"text":"From the moment we sat down and had our drink orders to the interaction with the manager, I have never had such poor customer service in my life. The server was rude, frantic and it took 25 minutes to receive our drink order. The other patrons on the patio were not being served very quickly either and families with young children had their orders skipped completely. The server we had should learn the phrase \"I am sorry\" instead of being defensive when customers followed up regarding their orders. 

A storm began to approach rather quickly and our table enquired about moving inside as it had started to thunder and lightning and it was dangerous to stay outside. The server told us we could not be accommodated and a manager told us there weren't tables available (there were over 10 empty tables when we ran inside) and that we had our table which was outside. To be told by a manager that we would need to continue to eat our dinner outside, on the patio during a thunder and lightning storm with glasses flying off tables and the umbrellas knocking into customers is absurd. 

This location should be an embarrassment to the east side Mario's franchise and needless to say I will never step foot in another locations ever again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night with my 4 yo daughter.  ESM used to be really good but we were very disappointed.  My daughter's pasta looked like it was put into the microwave or under the heat lamp too long.  The garden salad was lettuce only with no vegetables at all, nothing!  The only good thing about this experience is my daughters meal was free because of the kids club. 

We will not be returning, Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday dinner last night. Baked penne Alfredo was so-so. But one thing that I didn't like about this restaurant is the service. So my friend ordered the all you can eat pasta (a Wednesday special for $11.99) but the server charged my friend $7 more because apparently meatballs cause additional charges. The server did not inform my friend in the beginning and my friend still had to pay extra. This situation could've been dealt with better. If this is a trick to get more money from customers, it worked. But sadly, we are not coming there back again."}
{"text":"Stopped on my way home from a service call. I was seated promptly and my order was taken promptly. The food was good and service was great. Would come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I got a gift certificate to East Side Mario's from a friend, so my Husband and I thought we would make it a date.  One thing that is nice about the location is it is right in the mall, even though you have to go outside, so its a easy choice after some shopping or a movie.

We were greeted right away by the hostess and were told it would be a 10/15 minute wait for the dining room.  They gave us a balloon to hold, which I'm sure I would love if I was 5.  There isn't much area to wait in so we had to stand near the front door and freeze a bit.  Their lounge looks nice, 6 TVs to watch a game on.  While we were waiting the hostesses, were all standing together making weird noises and laughing a lot, seemed immature to me.  The 10 minutes passed quickly and we were seated in a booth right off the front door and secluded from the main restaurant area, which turned out to be a bit chilly.  Our waiter, Chris, came and asked us for our drink order.  He brought us some water while we waited for our drinks.  I ordered a Nochino Sour, their featured drink and when it arrived it was missing the maraschino cherry.  I told him the cherry was missing, he asked if I wanted it, I said yes.  He took off and returned with 6 cherries for me, which made me really happy, since I could eat a whole jar of them.  The drink itself was amazing!  

When he came to take our food order I asked how the Hells Kitchen Chicken was, he said it is the spiciest dish on the menu, his favorite. I decided on that and my Husband got the lasagna.  We both ordered garden salads, which are complementary, so Chris brought us a big bowl of that, along with our little loaf of bread.  I am always one to take full advantage of free food, so we got another bowl of salad and another 2 loaves of bread.  The salad was good, mostly just lettuce, the bread was hot and fresh.  We waited a good 20 minutes for our food.  My chicken turned out to be a reasonable portion, one chicken breast, along with spaghetti and roasted veggies.  I could tell the chicken was frozen, it wasn't very fresh tasting at all.  The tomato sauce over it was not that spicy.  The veggies were a bit shrivelled.  Overall everything tasted okay.  Chris was very attentive during our meal.  He cleared the plates promptly.  Our bill with 2 drinks each and 2 entrees came to $64.

The service at East Side was great, that is what would influence me to go back.  The food was good, not the most amazing I've ever had, although the drinks were awesome."}
{"text":"The definition of quantity over quality. The pasta is so flavorless, it's clear that their target consumer has the palate of an 8 year old child. Plus, there was something wrong with the AC when we went so it was boiling hot in the restaurant - we just wanted to leave by the time our main courses arrived. Service was slow and mediocre. Seriously, I don't understand why this place is so busy? A lot of people who like bland food in Milton I guess. Or maybe it's the Pokestop. Worst restaurant experience in years - only came because the birthday girl picked it (she later regretted that decision). We'll stick to Scaddabush or Jamie's next time."}

Bland, bland and more bland.   Nolhing exciting here,  just a formula chain eatery."}
{"text":"Had one of the $25 coupons that I bought for $12, and headed off to here for the first time in several years.  Place was quite busy on a Saturday at around 5:00 p.m.  Waited for about 10 minutes before a table was available.

Had the caesar salad and bread to start.  Caesar was nice and fresh.  Roll was warm and crusty.  Waitress was friendly and attentive, and quickly brought me a refill on my iced tea, and another bread.  Asked me if I wanted more salad but i was fine.

Entree was the backribs with fries.  Came about 10 minutes after the appetizer.  Size of rib portion was HUGE.  Rib sauce was a little thick and sweet, but not really an issue. 

Had the peanut butter layer cake for dessert.  Was somewhat heavy, but hit the spot.

In summary, the food was actually quite good and service was great.  For casual restaurant dining in the suburbs, this was perfectly fine."}
{"text":"The service by the waitress (who did not tell us her name) on June the 9th during the day  was extremely poor, her uniform was ripped, hair was messy.  The service was almost unbearable  as we were asking questions about the menu ,she looked uninterested and annoyed.  When we got the Food it  was not prepared well pasta was hard, dry and tasteless , bruschetta was gross ,Salad  looked like it was thrown on the plate  and I did even touch my burnt veal sandwich. Won't be coming back to East Side Mario's"}
{"text":"East side Mario's is the best. They have wonderful service, the food is amazing & on top of that before you receive your meal they serve you breadsticks & a nice big salad, so you fill up right away. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who enjoys eating pasta and enjoys a good time with their family!"}
{"text":"East side Mario's is a go to for my family. Although the food is some weird Americanized version of Italian food, I always find something to enjoy. 

First of all, the unlimited salad option really is needed at every meal. My kids devour the salad.. So anything that promotes eating salad is good by me. 

My usual go to meal is the penne arrabiata but today I had the chicken Parmesan. Huge portion of chicken with pasta.very nice. Keeping in mind this isn't true Italian, it's very good. 

My son is Gluten free and they have a good menu for that too. Their Gluten free pizza is a hit. 

Good for the family"}
{"text":"Chain restaurant... what can I say? As for the question of why I ended up eating here one night... well, the answer is that I had a gift card I had to use up. At least the salmon was juicy, so I'll give it one star for that."}
{"text":"This place was renovated a few years ago and looks much more appealing.  It was very busy on Saturday evening but the waitress accommodated us with a table as we wanted to sit at the bar area.  The beer was cold and refreshing. They gave us warm bread w butter, the atmosphere was a cheerful. Will go back to try some appetizers next time."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna it was very dry and had zero sauce in between the layers. It was very dissapointing and I would not recommended this dish to anyone"}
{"text":"Many of these places have closed in other areas and this one is about time it does too. The food was awful, the free (avoid) salad was rotten the soup was not bad but very watery. Service is very slow and unfriendly and our meals were all bad, pasta was uncooked, pizza was very dry with little toppings and you had to cut the meat off of the ribs with a steak knife . if you're hungry, go somewhere else. If you want a drink, stop by, but be prepared to wait for it"}
{"text":"I like the new decor but the service was painfully slow especially since we were visiting with young children. 
When we got our bill I noticed we were overcharged on our pasta dishes which indicated $9.99 on the menu. When I questioned the waitress she said \"oh, did you want the lunch size\". Well since we were there for lunch and we ordered from the lunch menu I would have thought that was obvious!!
For what you pay we could do much better elsewhere!! Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very bad service! 
We ordered 2 pasta which come with unlimited soup or salad, the food was ok but the service was bad. 
The waitress literally just took our order and delivered the food, she did not ask us how's the food or if we want refill of soup and salad. When I asked for more soup she said there's no more soup left! It was only 8PM and they close at 11! She then collected all the plates and gave me the bill. I was extremely disappointed and definitely NO RETURN!"}
{"text":"This is our second time to this location since they opened 4 weeks ago. The service is getting better but everyone seams inexperienced. The food is hot, fresh and served quick. Still no liquor license which looks odd because they have a big bar with no one at it. 
They created a new look to the interior... more of a pizza shop than an Italian restaurant. 
 The average plate price seams higher than before although no more than any of its competitors... still a good bargain night out."}
{"text":"I went there for a late dinner and we wanted to sit at a booth in the dining area but my friend wanted one of the specials you can only get at the bar.  I don't like that you can only get certain specials if you sit by the bar, especially when the place is some what empty, they should allow you those specials anywhere you sit.  It's a pretty ugly atmosphere, dark and boring.  

My friend and I sat at a high table close to the bar, and at that end they had a cart for dirty dishes sitting just across from us, gross!  but just wait it get's worse... I ordered the bacon wrapped scallop pasta with salad and garlic bread, and my friend ordered the pizza special.  Her pizza was dried out and nasty, and one of my bacon wrapped scallops had a hair wrapped into it. YUM YUM, I love eating other people's hair!  the pasta with my dish was pretty bland and boring.  

The salad that came with my dish was a ceasar with way too much dressing and when I asked for less on the next one they gave me none, also when the waitress brought another salad serving she didn't offer me cheese on top and completely disappeared, I literally had to go to the bar and get the cheese shredder myself and shred my own cheese.  

I wish I could give it a 0/5 but apparently that's not a possibility so it's a 1/5 for their.. um, well the garlic bread was good.  Never going here again though!"}
{"text":"This used to be a nice restaurant but not anymore. 

Staff - the location needs additional servers. We waited 30 min for seating then 15 min for server to first visit our table. We ordered simple pasta dishes so the kids wouldn't have to wait too long to eat. It took 30 min for meals to arrive. After meals were finished we waited 15 min for server to bring our bill. 

Food: portions have been cut in 1/2. No value vs cost. 

Restaurant itself: was nice when opened but lack of maintenance is now apparent.  The 'buy one get one' deal is a rip off. 

My suggestion - go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lousy service combined with their ever shrinking portions, I would not recommend this location.

Food wasn't bad but this is big box."}
{"text":"This is my 5 year old daughter's favorite restaurant. I like that the kids eat free! It is what it is. Good enough food. They use to have the best waiter ever there! But sadly I think he left! My kids LOVED him and he was really sweet and attentive and always remembered us. We miss him. In short we go here too much! Oh and the Basa is actually really good."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for a quick appetizers before movies, waited 10'minutes for our drinks and first appetizer arrived and they said they dropped the other one on the floor so we waited another 20 min.
No wonder they dropped it, the floor in the kitchen was really greasy, full of food and they were all sliding in and out of a kitchen.
One of the \"chefs\" had a long hair and a beard that looked like pubic hear (no net) and l could see 10 inches of his underwear at any given moment because his pants were hanging almost down his knees.
Had stomach problems that night.
Never coming back!!!
DIRTY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Save you money and get your self a can of soup some jar of tomato sauce pasta and that will cost you only $5.50
It will taste much better and you will  have a lunch for the next day .
The place looks nice but the food is not .
If you can make toast you also can boil your own pasta"}
{"text":"Like an idiot I seem to come here every time I visit my sister in Toronto. I will give credit to the diablo Calamari, table bread, and Caesar salad. They should just stick to appetizers, bread and salad, because everything went downhill from there. The kids chicken fingers are now a gross Cajun panko mix that my kids hated. (They used to have normal crunchy chicken fingers). My veal sandwich was a soggy patty covered in gross peppers on cold dry bread. This is AFTER I told them no peppers. Good thing my kids didn't eat their meals because they gave me literally 5 fries as a side. Our server was nice, but very inexperienced perhaps. Didn't see her for large sections of time and refills were difficult to get on drinks. We had to ask for the kids desserts and ask for containers twice (not that anyone ate the leftovers). The kitchen was SUPER slow despite it being only 4pm and the restaurant being pretty empty. All the entree food came to us cold, but on hot plates. Overall disappointment."}
{"text":"Our server at this location was a cheerful young woman who spoke so quickly that she became breathless and as she told us the types of beers on tap her speech became unintelligible.  We had to ask her to repeat the list and still not quite understanding her rapid auctioneer style speech we just ordered what we thought they might have!   Our beers were delivered quickly to our sticky table (luckily not from food residue but from a gooey build up of furniture polish, wax and oils). 

 We both decided on the Everyday Value meal of Spaghettini Bolognese that included an all-you-can eat soup or salad and garlic home loaf.   My date was the Big K, the slender man, who can eat for four.  How fortuitous and brilliant to choose a restaurant that could quite possibly fill his stomach.  Alas, it was not to be.  Our server was somehow able to sense that the Big K had hollow legs and began to play a clever game of cat and mouse.   When the Big K was asked if he might want another serving of soup he said, \"In a while\" and she replied that she would return in three minutes to check.  We didn't see her again until she delivered the bill. 

Other servers took over the delivery of and the clearing away of food (that could be best described as mediocre) and backed away so rapidly from our table and from the man with the hollow legs (had they been warned?) that it was awkward and impossible to beg, \"Please, can we have more? \"  The garlic home loaf was very small and gone in two bites.   They even skimped on the sauce on the Spaghettini.  Offered \"fresh\" cheese, we were not surprised when the server  \"ran out.\"  This restaurant was a complete tease."}
{"text":"I attended the location with my wife and we waited 15 minutes to be seated even though there was a multitude of seating options seeing as the restaurant was dead. Eventually we were greeted by the host who was about as friendly as Hitler himself. We ordered our meal and proceeded to wait another 45 minutes before we received our drinks which had traces of meals prior. With every sip it was as if we were tasting the dissatisfaction of the previous patrons. Our salad arrived and was perhaps the only redeaming portion of the meal. However I don't see how it was endless as we never saw another salad despite repeatedly ordering them from our sever whose attentiveness rivaled that of an autistic goldfish. When the food arrived it was as if we had been catfished. The lasagna resembled vomit and sure enough didn't even taste as good as if hope vomit would taste. My wife's pasta was oily and we asked for cheese several times only to have our server wander off and stand behind the counter before returning with a blank expression. Staff was very evasive and do everything humanly possible to avoid customers. And the food was not even fit to be served to dogs as the meat was unidentifiable and clearly not for human consumption. All in all great place to visit if your looking to purge your lower intestine and spend the remainder of your evening in the latrine. Only thing endless on the menu was the rude staff and at least the bill was promptly received. I wouldn't touch this place with a laser pointer ."}
{"text":"Not the greatest but no complaints either. Highlights were grwat service and the fact children eat free sun to Thursday :).

Lots of extra food to take home also have a good eve 
Kids alsi get free desert"}
{"text":"when there today before a movie the service was very bad we had a bad salad and soup was cold taste old"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5:40 on Sunday, and had to wait 15 min for a table even though there were 6 open. Understaffed, we assumed, since they eventually sat us at one of those anyways. Our server Noelle was fake friendly (\"everyday is a good day!\"), and didn't offer a single amenity without us asking and waiting for it (salad and bread refills, drink refills, kids dessert, bill). Food was mediocre and everything tasted fairly processed other than the salad. The fresh grated Parmesan cheese is even processed now, and comes out looking like shaved styrofoam. All in all, not nearly as good as I remembered from my university days. Far better food and service at other suburban chains."}
{"text":"Brought our kids for a birthday. Do not order any steak here... Should have known not to order a steak at a cheap Italian chain. Ordered rare... Came out about 1/3 inch thick with a globs of fat everywhere and as hard as a shoe sole. Sent it back. Got another 1/3 inch steak that was medium but since everyone in my party already finished, I ate half of it. The rest was fat again. 
Seems like they need a new dishwasher or better staff to look at stuff before its served. The cutlery is disgusting here!! Seems like I got someone else's meal on my fork! From a couple of days prior!!"}
{"text":"my husband and i went there today for his birthday. we ordered the chicken parm. when our salad came it was just lettuce when we asked for parm cheese on our salad she didnt ask if that was enough. just walked away. the bread didnt come in bags. then our chicken parm came and  again we had to ask for cheese and pepper. when we were done we said we wanted to take our salad home that was remade and she must understood cus she went and thur it out. the bread was soft and not done. will try to hook the time there srandards are higher."}
{"text":"East side mario's  is okay. Chain restaurant I've been visiting since I was a kid. It has its ups and downs.

The decor is interesting. Literally interesting, neat stuff to look at and read throughout the dining room. I kind of like that, each part of the restaurant offers something different in that respect.

I have mixed feelings about the food. The garlic bread they bring out prior to the entrees is warm and delicious. It may very well be the best part of the meal. The Italian wedding soup is Campbells brand. I'm not kidding it's seriously Campbell's italian wedding. The pasta is alright, nothing extraordinary. The thing about East Side Mario's is that all of the food is acceptably good, but nothing more.

The service is usually quite good though. Servers are always attention and courteous, and in a few cases hilarious. A good server always helps the experience in my mind.

It's worth a visit if you feel like an inexpensive meal out."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Food was awful. Cold Saw a server drop a loaf of bread and pic it up and reserve it. If your looking for a quick meal joeys markville is a way better options"}
{"text":"What looks good from the outside can be deceiving!!! From all appearances, it looked like we were in for a treat. It was a horrible imitation of an expensive Olive Garden. The pizza was very doughy, the sauce was totally forgettable, and the salads were less than mediocre, and the bread was maybe the best thing we ate. Save your money and look elsewhere!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved it! Primavera spaghetti was delicious. Stuffed mushrooms were great too! Loved every bit of it. Our waitress was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant and know what to expect, but was hoping for some improvement. I'm speaking in regard to the customer service. The food is generally passable, but portion sizes seem on the small side.
Why I give them 1 star is the abysmal customer service. You can order the unlimited soup and salad, but don't expect to ever get second or third helpings as the wait staff literally disappears on you.
During our meal, when we finally did get second helpings the waitress gave bread, no butter and I had to literally walk in to the kitchen myself to get some. My daughter declined her second helping of salad at the time, but when she wanted a refill, our waitress disappeared for 30 minutes and could not be found and the restaurant wasn't that busy. We had to wander around and ask the bar staff and then another waitress to serve us which took another 10 minutes.
We also had to remind them of the To-Go order we asked for originally of stuffed mushrooms. The original waitress finally showed back up with the wrong take out order (button mushrooms) and we asked it be removed from the menu.
I gave her a minimal tip and a \"not recommend\" on the credit card device survey that came up.
On the way out, the dirty dishes that were sitting in the booth two stalls behind us were finally cleared (one hour after those customers left).
We have had similar experiences in the past and one time sat there for 15 minutes with no waitress coming to out table to take our order and we got up and walked out.

The owners of this location better start to hire more wait staff and train them on basic customer service, otherwise I recommend you avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my family went to East Side Mario's  
2171 Steeles Ave W, Toronto, ON M3J 3N2.
 My son, who is almost three years old, has contracted food poisoning from this restaurant after eating their spaghetti and meatballs. It was ordered from the kids menu.  I want to make sure that no other family and child goes through what he is going through."}
{"text":"Okay spot if you want some pizza or pasta with unlimited salad/soup. I find East Sides used to be so delicious but feel it kind of went down hill n is rather average."}
{"text":"This East Side Mario's has many pros and cons. Their wait staff and ayce garlic bread/salad/soup are amazing. Their hostesses, portion sizes, and environment needs improvement.

Upon arrival we were greeted by interrupting a non-family topic between FOUR hostesses. They seemed like they didn't want to seat us at all. The food took roughly 15-20 minutes to arrive and the wait time was filled in with unlimited bread and salad. Our waitress was very attentive and nice. She always swung by right as we finished our serving of bread or salad and helped us get refills. At the end of our meal she even let us take home a fresh bowl of salad she just brought out to us. I guess the small portion sizes were made up for in unlimited side dishes.

Taste could have used improvement as the fish and chips I ordered heavily depended on the tartar sauce for any depth of flavour. It was simply a plate with a fillet of fish and a  thin layer of fries next to it. The salad was better, to be honest.

Tl;Dr: rude hostesses, great marketing with unlimited soup/salad/bread, friendly wait staff, and family oriented diner."}
{"text":"VERY hit-or-miss.

I've been here twice in the last month - once to celebrate my birthday, and once to celebrate my brother's. The first was a fantastic experence, full of attention to detail on the server's part. The second was a colossal disappointment.

Maybe I'm expecting a bit too much in terms of quality, but I fail to see how a restaurant can go from one polar opposite to the other in such a short amount of time.

The first time I visited was great. I had the broccoli rigatoni special, and it hit the spot just right. The server was astute enough to bring everyone their own personal bowl of salad (no having to scoop it out onto your plate, lol) and the servers were engaged and happy when they did the obligatory humiliating birthday song for me. I'm well past the point of being embarrassed. I still have a photo of myself as a kid wearing moose antlers at Jack Astor's and looking like a nerd. Those scars still haven't healed.

The most recent time I visited, it was like night and day. The place was filled with rowdy kids running around and screaming. We had an hour-plus long wait just for our salads, never mind the mains. When they did arrive, one of the Riso Italiano dishes (three of us ordered the same thing) had chicken that was burnt to a crisp. After asking it to be sent back, the second order was also burnt. It takes a special kind of person to burn chicken twice even after being told about it. We had to flag the manager down and show it, and to her credit, she immediately apologized and comp'd the dish.

But that isn't even mentioning the scatterbrained server who tried to upcharge us on an order of Buddha Bread after we gave him a coupon for it, servers walking around in a daze and a general feeling of disinterest. Maybe they were having an off day, but I have had much better service at this location in the past.

If you're going to visit this location, keep your expectations firmly in check."}
{"text":"Everytime we have been here it has been great.  The food is good but the service is absolutely spectacular! We have never had a bad server. Management here seems to know how to pick and train quality staff. Would totally recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered one pasta for take out for \"now\". Was not told in advance after order was placed that it would take 1 hour for this location. Fine. Wanted to pay in advance however not one waitress bothered to assist us. 
Yea, DONT order takeout haha."}
{"text":"Well, one of the only reasons for the 2 stars is that they are open late....definitely a plus, as we came here during a visit to Markham, and were looking for food rather late.  However, that was sadly one of the only pluses to our experience here.  First, our waiter, who was very nice, apologized for being sick and losing his voice -- which was sweet, but also a little off-putting when you are ordering food from a sick server. And his memory apparently went with his voice, because he kept forgetting what we ordered, our drinks, to check on us, etc.  He must have apologized a hundred times, and we couldn't figure out if he was new, or just maybe not cut out to be a waiter. At some point other waitresses were feeling bad for us and trying to help out.  After what seemed like forever, we started to get our food, but it came out at all different times so that some of us were almost done eating before others at our table got their food. On top of that, the food was very hit and miss. Some of the orders were wrong, some were decent, and others were just terrible.  It is definitely not authentic Italian food (more fast-food type quality) so we were not expecting much more than that, especially since they were open late.  But overall it was just not very good, and very overpriced for the quality.  I would give it one star, but decided to give it two since we were hungry and they were one of the only places that was open late.  I'd only recommend going here if it's very late, and you're really desperate for any type of food!"}
{"text":"Great service. Even though it was busy we didnt have to wait long for anything. Food was awesome and they will modify just about anything. 

Garlic bread was fresh, salad was lighly dressed and all the food came out hot. 

No complaints for anyone  will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Went to ESM last night for supper. We arrived with our 2 children ages 3 and 9 months. We were shown to a booth and when asked for a high chair so we didn't have to hold her while we eat we're told can't put a high chair here is a booster seat ok...for an infant. We said no so we're given a small table where we could put a high chair. We ordered the bogo pasta so we could have the second one for lunch the next day. We waited forever for our salad and didn't even have cutlery. Then while waiting asked for a second loaf of bread for our meal. Our pasta arrived. No bread. We ate our entire meal (though our waitress started removing my plate before I had even finished while I was giving something to the baby) and then they brought a loaf of bread. Our waitress asked if we wanted dessert to which I replied \"no thanks, we're good\". Then she turned to my 3 year old and asked him if he wanted dessert. I again relied \"no\" and then I had to deal with my 3 year old upset because the waitress asked him if he wanted dessert\" when I had already told her no. You don't ask a 3 year old if they want dessert. The answer is always yes and then the parents have to deal with that when they already said no. 
Went to pay and use my groupon $10 voucher only to be told can't use it due to what we ordered (which I understood after). Paid, got our second meals to take home and left. We discussed our terrible dining experience on the way home. 
This morning I took my pasta out to heat up for lunch. Noticed underneath a sticker that said \"Saturday\". So that would make my pasta now 4 days old. I heated it up and it was so rubbery I could barely chew a bite. So in to the garbage it went. Will definitely NOT be going there again. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Never again. Tried it after a long hiatus from bad service last time. Bad service again -- and so slow. (Didn't expect great food, it's really is fast food at high prices.) We complained as our 45 min wait for food turned into more slow service (all you can eat pasta only works if the service is decent) and a very long night. We talked to the manager and successfully argued 15% off the bill. Great-that works out to about $4 for 2 hours of wasted time -- what should have been 1 1/2 hours was more like 3 1/2"}
{"text":"Worest resturant service EVER!!
We went for Mother's Day taking mom and our friends mom. We waited from 6:30 to 9:00 to get our main course!! That should be in Guinness record!! 

The waiter her name is Casandra!! Missed up our order, she came after 15min asking us to repeat the order! Salad and soup took so long to come! Oh my good ot was really horrible experience. Manger only gave us 10% for our order for the delay which was not pleasent (-10$) from the bill doesnt worth waiting that much!!

The manager should make it up to us, and should think of hiring more people. We came to celebrate and enjoy our time, but it was tottally the oppsite, it was frustrating and the food took about 2hrs and a half to come and we couldnt eat it!!
Dont go to this branch you will defently regret it!!"}
{"text":"Well, we waited about 15 min to be seated. We got served by \"Nasim\" . We got the deal for 11.99 pasta plats.
The complementary bread was so fresh and yummy, was a good start. 
We had then our salad, was not great but was fine. We also had a tomato soup, was so delious and special.
Our pasta plate was very good. I really had a very good experience, our servant was very friendly, helpful, and smily. She was not bothered for our request. 
I recommand this place, and happy with my visit."}
{"text":"Average food with high school staff. Long waits to sit in empty dinnng room.

The draw here us the awesome kid's menu, which is the most diverse kids menu I have seen, from pasta or chicken nuggets all the way to a kid sized steak.

Free soup or salad and warm breadsticks per entree  and bottom less soda.

Safe chain restaurant fare."}
{"text":"Came in on family day, hoping to sit down for a nice family dinner. We're regular patrons of this restaurant and our kids love the food here. 
Kids wanted to get some spaghetti and meatballs. Waiter informed us they ran out of meat sauce. Kids wanted soup with their meal, ran out of tomato soup. My daughter wanted to get Italian wedding , they're were out but after waiter came back, they managed to get a pot going and got  another somehow. And no Coke! Seriously?  How? It's a syrup.  It seems to me that there's a significant issue with management in respect to anticipating demand during valentines and family day. If they know they'll run out of certain items, management needs to do everything they can to make sure they can handle dinner service. Call your suppliers and get it done. It is embarrassing that they won't even give my son a side of fries instead  of soup. Management will not allow. What the heck is going on? Are they purposely trying to prevent customers from coming back?  We haven't gotten the main course yet so stay tuned.... Ok. Got main course. No wholewheat noodles so I got regular. Meatballs weren't even cooked in sauce and aribiata sauce was very suspect. Tastes like plain sauce. chilli flakes sprinkled on top. Literally. That's not how I remember it. Maybe they ran out as well.  Wasn't impressed at all. Job well done. They managed to lose regular customers.  Oh yeah. They messed up the bill too.  Simply terrible."}
{"text":"I've gone here sporadically since it first opened many years ago, and never had a problem.
It's as good as a franchise Italian restaurant can get.
Recently my husband and I went for the value meals, which honestly I would not recommend unless you just like noodles, sauce and a very tiny portion of veges/mea0 on top.
But it wasn't too salty or greasy, and it comes with unlimited soup or salad.
If you go, I would suggest one of their classic meals (pay extra!)
Service was great, even though there were about 3 large birthday parties going on."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best service I've received at this location! They've definitely improved over the last year! 

I always hesitate going to this location because of poor service and experience in the past. But I had a gift card to use and we're so glad it was worth it!

Our server was Ashley L and she deserves some recognition for great service! 

- she was very friendly & genuine
- she served us bread while looking at the menu and took our drink orders
- waters came asap 
- she knew the menu well 

Of course, the kitchen should get some credit too for quick service as well! 

Overall, great food and amazing service! It exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Went in a date with my boyfriend last night there. He ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and when it came they let us know the dish has changed from the menu and the scallops are now mini and not bacon wrapped. Seemed unprofessional not to have the menus up to date. My meal was fine but my boyfriend said the scallops were gritty and he felt they weren't properly washed. The server said she'd get a a manager and even after making eye contact from across the store, the manager never came over to apologize or speak with us. Seemed overall like no one had pride in their job."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on trips to Toronto for work and while the service is fair and the atmosphere rivals it, East Side Mario's is chain food. If you're looking for an inexpensive meal or a place to bring the family, the food here isn't bad, but also doesn't compare to a mom and pop spot. if you're not against average, mass produced Italian, this is your spot."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to this location in about three years.  I was craving their Hell's Kitchen chicken.  Oh, what a disappointment for one of their signature dishes.  It was much better three years ago with a lost more sauce.  The broccoli had the tell tale signs of being microwaved with the brown marks.  Then the service...after serving the entree, the servers disappeared.  After I finished my meal, still no sight of them from the bar.  I waived them down to pay my bill.  No questions of how the food was.  Just a question of whether I wanted another beer.  I declined.  At least the beer is good!"}
{"text":"I came here during lunch with some of my coworkers. We got the table fairly quickly and the experience was been high wait time on getting the food out of the kitchen.

The server were friendly and quick to take order and get the payment done. 

For Starters, we ordered the four cheese dip, calamari al diavolo. Both the starters were good but we definitely enjoyed the Calamari as it had a kick to it because it came with red, green and hot cherry bomb peppers on a sizzlin' skillet.

For the main, I went with \"THE ULTIMATE ITALIAN GRILLED CHEESE\" sandwich and let me tell you there was nothing ultimate about it. I was quite disappointed with it. The sandwich was stuffed with pizza mozzarella, bruschetta and our basil pesto sauce but no distinctive taste. I enjoyed more of the garlic Parm fries which came with it.

Overall, the only high light was the Calamari!

..till next time! B out."}
{"text":"It's not often that i will write a review while I'm sitting at the restaurant. But, in this case, it's totally warranted. 

We are here for lunch on family day with a total of 2 adults and 2 kids. The dining area was full so we got seated at a booth on the bar side very quickly with the hostess being very friendly, she cleaned the table really quickly so we could get seated right away. After getting seated it all went downhill....

Our server has some serious attitude problems. Showing no emotion, being very cold. 

Ordered a 10\" pizza off the kids menu. The pizza was a joke. Barely any sauce, cheese or pepperoni to the point that the dough was bubbling thru on more then half of the pizza.

Our water never got refilled. When we asked for more bread for the kids it seemed it like it was inconvenience for the waitress and it took forever to be brought out. 

I understand that it was busy but we still deserved to have decent food and service.... The waitress was working hard but management should have staffed extra. 

Never coming back.

Btw, we were just given the bill and we didn't even ask for it...  ha. What a joke."}
{"text":"Walked in as a family of four, the manager was at the front door when we did and told us that they are cleaning a table and it will be couple of minutes. Fifteen minutes later I'm staring at three large empty table yet we are not being seated. So he walks up and I ask him \"you have these entry tables yet we are standing here waiting\" to which he replied \"I have a party of 50 coming in\".
Obviously I was not happy about this and told him that's not what he told me when we walked in, had he told me it will be a while I would have not waited since I was in a hurry and could not wait. Instead of apologizing about his screwup, he takes a tone telling me that's too bad and he's waiting for a booth to clear up so he seat us. Yeah right, I want to wait who knows how much longer and eat at an establishment that has no clue what customer service is and how to talk to a customer. I would rate this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Monday night. The restaurant had 3 other tables occupied with 3 servers on duty. It took theem more than 5 minutes to seat us even though both the chefs and servers had seen us upon entry. They did not acknowledge us in any way. Once seated we waited another 5 minutes for our server. The food was also slow in delivery (unusual @ dinner)

Other than the extremely LONG wait times when it was clearly NOT BUSY, dinner was okay. The server was very attentive. He was friendly and made sure to check back with us frequently. 

The once upon a time yummy garlic bread now officially tasted like cardboard. Cesar salad was decent. Entrees - large portions. Pasta was okay. Steak, cooked and seasoned well."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars - I would. Our experience started out great. The hostess was prompt and really friendly. As soon as we were seated it was downhill from there. There was a total of 8 tables occupied in the restaurant only to wait forever to even be acknowledged. We decided to go to the bar and order our own drinks I explain we had been waiting to be served only to have the bar manager roll his eyes, After another lengthy wait we finally received our food and the order was missing three parts, the pizza was under cooked. After calling over the manager and politely explaining we were missing parts of our dinner she blew us off. 
Again another long wait until the missing salad arrived only to taste like some sort of cleaning product. After using the women's bathroom and discover vomit all over the floor we decided to leave.
My boyfriend felt ill 30min after leaving and suffered diarrhea for the entire following day. 
Unfortunately I don't feel even the management was interested in making changes.
The alarming fact people were vomiting from eating there and getting sever diarrhea from their food I would strongly advise avoiding this restaurant."}
{"text":"I should split this review into two: Patio (4 Star!) and The Rest. I seldom come to this area, so it was nice to see that Markville Mall has classed it up so much!

Our family reservation was for 6pm, but my parents and I were there earlier. My dad, who LOVES the sun, noticed the patio and so we decided to have some drinks and wait for the rest of the crew. The patio is basic, but it is so lovely because the sun always faces you. My dad had a Ceasar (comes in a HUGE glass) and my mom and I had a glass of Pinot. It was great.

Then, it was time to go inside and have dinner. That's when things took a downturn. By no means do you go to East Side Mario's for authentic Italian. The food here is cheesy, and bland. Any pasta dish here is smothered in cream. Forget about anything being Al Dente. My dad ordered a steak, rare, but it came completely cooked. I mean, sure, you don't come here for steak, but at least make it decent.

Our waitress was an old hag. Sorry to say this, but she just looked tired to be serving our huge family of 20. I would see it as big bucks. She started off by telling us how we should order our appetizers, instead of us telling her what we wanted. I shared a Medium Pizza with my aunt, and while it was good, it wasn't out of this world. 

If I were ever in the area, I would definitely come for the patio, drinks, and a light bite. I am sure you can get a better tasting meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service is terrible here! We had to wait over 10 minutes for a table when there are many plenty of tables available because they have to 'set up a table' which involves putting a stack of plates on the table. 

It takes another 15 minutes before a waitress even comes by. 

This was on an afternoon when the restaurant wasn't able vendors busy. I'd hate to think what a regular night is like here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quantity, this is the place for you. But if you're looking for quality and authenticity ... look elsewhere. 

Tomato soup - taste like pasta sauce ...
House salad - no taste, barely anything  in it other than lettuce, grape tomatoes and one olive.
Italian wedding soup - it's alright

Linguine Mussle Alfredo - watery sauce, no dynamic just basil
Chicken parmigiano - it's OK

Service here is alright, servers are OK but there is a manager (guy with long black hair) who has no emotions or service skills. He doest not greet customers nor does he introduce the item he puts down.

It's a good deal if you eat a lot of soup, bread and salad. But don't expect much.

Also, the AC apparently is on but it's so hot I'm  sweating sitting waiting for my bill ...."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But so, so, so incredibly terrible now. When we came in, it was so dead and there were only 2 tables. We waited in the front for 5 mins, and the server and bartender made eye contact with me but nobody came to seat us. Then when we sat, the server didn't even greet us just asked if we knew what we wanted. After she was okay, but the food was just mediocre. And she forgot my drink. Manager was nice, but terrible impression of restaurant. Will not be returning ever"}
{"text":"Terrible meal and terribly terrible service. Manager has an attitude and the server didn't  seem to care about service at all. The pasta was super dry and had no flavor whatsoever. Swear to never return!!"}
{"text":"I always found salad and bread to be a great way to jump start my meal. It is always consistent at Eastside Mario's and just what you expect, the only problem is just like at Olive Garden I always fill up on these tasty starters before my meal comes... and in this case we got the salad and bread before the appy we ordered which was a spinach dip. (it was thick and cheesy)

I ordered the Cheese Cappelletti for my meal which I could hardly eat because I was filled up on bread and salad/dip but regardless it was exactly what I thought it would be like - not to fancy, no nonsense pasta.  It was good but not something I would rave about. The food came out really fast and at one point we had an appy, the bread and salad and our mains all on the table at once, I think it would have been nicer to have it a bit more spaced out but I was under the impression they were more about pumping out the orders to make the tables available since this location was very busy.

I wasn't particularly fond of where we were sat (right beside the kitchen) It was loud and the table was kind of tiny but our service was great. The manager even came over to ask us how our meal was which was nice considering it was a Saturday night at 6PM.

Overall it was a tasty experience that I wouldn't mind repeating in the future - but I think we'll try the lounge."}
{"text":"Far below my expectations. Nothing is prepared fresh on site; apparently it all comes in pre-cooked and all they do is warm it up. Everything is incredibly salty and takes like a frozen entree that you can buy at the grocery store. Pasta was gummy, sauce was packed in sodium, veal was like a leather sole. Find another spot. This isn't worth it."}
{"text":"My family's go to restaurant. Unlimited garlic bread and salad (with the order of a main meal) they have a secret dressing on the salad that they make themselves, you can buy a bottle for home, I would recommend chicken parmigiana"}
{"text":"The worst service i hav experienced anywhere. Been to other locations and always had good experiences. This was a shock. We reserved days ahead and they were not ready for us. We waited  to order drinks.  Long wait for their arrival. Still no menus at that point. Had to ask a bus person to find the waiter. Food was slow to come. Again no waiter in the room. He did not come to check if we had everything. Some were drinking and one of the guys wanted another. When asked the waiter said he was uncomfortable and cut off the entire table! We then asked for the manager who arrivdd with her arms crossed and a confrontational attitude."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times my order was so ruined I ended up not eating anything. The last time I went with my parents and my mom and I ordered the same thing: fettuccini with rosé sauce. My dad ordered soup. What we GOT was cold soup with no spoon, one fettuccini alfredo, and another fettuccini with NO SAUCE. I asked for both fettuccinis to be corrected. They were taken away. No spoon was offered. The fettuccinis came back, this time lightly tinted pink to give the impression they had bathed in the presence of rosé sauce before being wrung free of any moisture and delivered to us. I asked them to fix it and please add sauce. I also asked for a spoon so my dad could begin to eat his now-cold soup. The third time they brought back the fettuccini without sauce I was done. We'd been there for 1.5 hours and it wasn't even busy (maybe 10 tables were occupied).

People I recommend this to: my enemies and people I don't like."}
{"text":"If you are planning to eat at this location... forget about it! Worst service and the so called  chef burnt my food and still had it served to me"}
{"text":"East side marios is my go to restaurant. I love everything from the friendly staff, portion sizes to price!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant had a table of 10 and was told they have no room and don't take reservations never again will I or my family will go to any east side marios"}
{"text":"Ok so I just wanted to go out for dinner with my mom and my cousin and it was very interesting. Our waiter was probably stoned. We had two loaves of bread before our drinks came. He kept on saying \"I suck\" in a Scottish accent. I have to say that magician blew my mind and that was the best part. Our waiter mistook our drink orders and doesn't know what the word \"no\" means. He served us sweating on his knees and he was running when it wasn't busy. I noticed when he was serving other tables he was dropping bread and butter. And when it was time to pay he had the machine in his hand and said \"one minute I have to go get the machine\". Longest minute ever!! Ten minutes later he comes with the machine and we pay. He kept on calling my mother \"mom\". Overall this took us almost two hours for a DINNER."}
{"text":"Great that our server had the food ready, but the server was extremely rude. we were waiting for one more person the server served half our food anyways. Also, she gave us someone else's drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very impressed with this experience.

Our waitress was Shanice. She was fast, personable, smiling and friendly. We let her know we had tickets to a movie and she made sure we didn't have to wait for the bill so we wouldn't be late.  My husband ordered fish and chips and got the biggest order we'd ever seen!  I ordered Chicken Parmigiana and again the portion size was huge. The all you can eat bread and salad was done perfectly. The drinks we ordered, I had strawberry dacquiri, he had a rye and coke, were perfect as well.

It was very busy, quite a few people waiting as we were because we arrived without reservations. The wait wasn't long at all though as we were seated within 7 minutes. 
Even though it was very busy, all the staff were smiling and genuinely friendly. Kudos go out to the manager of this location for making sure that customer service is paramount.

The washrooms were very clean as was the entire restaurant.

It was a very nice dining experience. The only drawback would have been that it was a trifle noisy. But it was busy, there were several birthday celebrations going on in a family style restaurant so it's part of it and we didn't feel it detracted from what we were expecting.

We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"These guys are brutal!  So so type ambiance but the food and service was extremely bad. I ordered the Chicken pasta dish (can't remember exact name, but it was a tiny dish... and there were maybe 4 skinny slivers of chicken in there.  I told the server and her answer was \" Oh, that's the way it is!\".  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager; the manager came and said ...\"oh, that's just the way it is!!!\".  That's the way it is???!!!!  Wtf?!  So your chicken dish comes with no chicken??? and that's the way it is?   They wouldn't refund, but said I could order something else (no kidding). No apologies, no coupons or comps... nothing.

I will never ever go back to this joint."}
{"text":"East Side Mario's has always been a wannabe Olive Garden in my books. I mean, the bread, the salad and the fare, it's pretty much the same thing but not as good.

I don't love the food, I don't love the service but to be fair, I DO love the atmosphere of the place. The decor and ambiance has a lot more character than The Olive Garden, but the food isn't half as good. 

When I'm going out to eat, I care most about the food that I\"m eating. East Side Mario's may get 4 stars for decor and ambiance, but when it comes to service and the quality of the food, it comes out with an overall score of 2 stars.

Sorry guys, but when it comes to eating, it's definitely food over matter."}
{"text":"Came here tonight around 9:15pm. Front door and takeout door were locked. There were a few tables still seated inside. Knocked on the door and a waitress looked right at us and proceeded to walk away. Closes at 11pm though?"}
{"text":"Not sure how this franchise has managed to survive with their prepackaged meals and wannabe Italian food. Had the ribs which was one of the very few meals I have ever had to return... cold and tasted terrible. Tried the pasta but could tell it was not homemade fresh, very bland. The staff couldn't care less. If your concerned about what your family eats and want good Italian or affordable food go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation there and they put me on hold for 10 minutes.  So I hang up, try again, they put me on hold for 5 minutes!  (it was long distance too which sucks for my phone bill)  My parents really like East Side Marios so my dad ended up calling later and got through.  We did go there, and they were nice and everything.  My meal was kinda gross but maybe I just chose the wrong thing.  The salad and bread was good, but really, can that even be bad?

I definitely wouldn't go back to this location."}
{"text":"First off I sit down, and my plate was very dirty. Not just a film but actual food from the last persons meal.
Second the Soup, the soup was terrible I tried to eat it but the carrots in the soup were terrible. Squishy on the edge and hard in the center I am sure that its out of a can!

The broccoli that was a veggie side, was hard as a rock as well and I could even bite thru the carrot. Get me going about the Bacon Carbonara. It tasted AWFUL. Whatever they put in the sauce wasn't good Bacon wash squishy as well.

The Manager of the night tried to get me to take the food home which I was not interested in as I wasn't even going to eat it there so was in no way going to take it home.

Now today I called the number they emailed to me to deal with the problem. It was the Owner apparently, He basically said why are you complaining you didn't pay for anything. When In fact I paid for the appetizer which was the only good thing we received. 
He then tells me he orders food from the best supplier in the country, Which may be true but that only applies when the food your serving is fresh, because the food last night determines that was a lie. 
Then to tell me he has receipts stating his vegetables are fresh... When I bite into a vegetable I cant tell if its fresh or not! Don't lie to me.

On the phone he was rude and super defensive over his shitty quality food. Id be absolutely embarrassed to serve the food that came out of your kitchen last night.
NO WONDER YOUR STAFF ALL LOOK MISERABLE, YOUR NOT A PLEASANT PERSON TO DEAL WITH.
-Next time treat your customers with respect and you might get a better review.

Also let me state I don't want anything from East Side Marios. I just want you all to know how bad of an experience I had!"}
{"text":"Went for a drink and a bite to eat after work with a friend, and I must say neither one of us will ever go back. To start, we sat for about 10 minutes before the server came to our table, on a quiet night and then sat for another 15 minutes waiting for our drinks. My drink arrived and was almost half filled with ice, and not very good. I asked for a replacement drink and the waitress rolled her eyes then proceeded to go gossip with other coworkers, before going to correct the drink. I ordered pasta which came with a garden salad, that had a curly white hair. Ew. I told the waitress, she walked away again rolling her eyes and heading over to gossip. When she returned, I asked for a manager and waited. The service was disgusting. They were more focused on gossiping and talking about it then fixing it. A manager never came to the table and after 10 minutes of waiting, I walked out. Wish I could give 0 stars because the customer service and atmosphere was terrible. Step it up."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother because my eight-year-old nephew likes this chain.

The pros? The lunch special is actually pretty cheap. I had penne with sausage and the \"Italian poutine\" for $10.

The cons? Well, the food has never been great at this chain and it's, for the most part, quite overpriced. And it's not very good pasta, which is what the menu is based around. The \"poutine\" was just a mess of fires, mozzarella and pasta sauce -- disgusting.

Despite not liking the chain, this location gets two stars because the service was decent and the location is very good."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. The service here sucks we asked to sit in the bar area and the bartender started crying because she was too busy even thou ppl were leaving. They put us in the dinning area after a 15 min wait with over 7 tables free ( I counted) then they maid us wait and started severing ppl who sat down after us. The servers here are very lazy. Avoid this location if u can."}
{"text":"Consistently say we're never coming back but it is my son's favorite restaurant so we cave sometimes...... but tonight is just the worse. My son has acknowledged that he has to wait until he's an adult to come back! 
Food quality has changed, portion sizes are smaller and the service?! Omg the service is just awful. I come in with a smile and leave biting my tongue and cursing under my breath. 
How has this continued on for so long is beyond me. My suggestion? Go to the Olive Tree next door - you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The service was much improved my last visit.  The soup(minestrone) could have been steaming hot (was served warm) and the salad was ample served in a large bowl, enough for all of us.  Our food was good, and I was satisfied with the veal parmigiana.  My companions enjoyed their basa and seafood linguini.  I would suggest that since I am disabled and use a cane or a walker, that they have a side entrance door from the parking lot as it is a long walk to the front entrance.  There is a side entrance however it is only for take out patrons."}
{"text":"I know it's not real Italian but the Italian wedding soup was pretty good. Service was very good and with the all you can eat bread, salad or soup, it's a great bang for your buck. The decorum is old and outdated so this needs to be updated in all their franchises."}
{"text":"Definitely nothing special, the only good things about this restaurant is that I leave super full because of the bread and salad. 

Tonight we went because we were feeling to lazy to make dinner. It was Mother's Day, but it was just me and my boyfriend. When we first entered there were 4 staff standing around the hostess stand talking. We walked up to them and literally stood there awkwardly for 5 minutes waiting for them to acknowledge us. Then the guy says to us before even \"welcome\" or anything was \"we're all out of ribs, steak and salmon tonight\". Ok, Hi to you too. 

There was a 30 minute wait for a table, which we were kind of expecting because it was mother's day and we assume it would be busy. But then when we walked through the restaurant to our seats there were empty tables. 

When we ordered they were out of the appetizer we requested (stuffed mushroom caps), and they were also out of croutons for the salad. Seriously did they not order enough food for mothers day weekend? I mean all of this food I'm sure is made off site and then reheated in the kitchen.  How can they run out of so many different things? This place desperately needs some retraining of staff and new management. 

The food was ok. The salad and the bread is really the only good thing. I have no intentions of going back here....not unless I need to."}
{"text":"When out for a movie at Silvercity in Brampton, you have your choice of many chain eateries in Trinity Commons. This time around, I popped into East Side Mario's, with about 45 minutes before my movie was to start. Cutting it a little close, but danger is my middle name.

The interior was nice and clean, and the server was very friendly. He also was compliant with my request to receive the bill along with my meal, to save time so I'm not late for my movie.

I've always liked the all-you-can-eat garlic bread feature with ESM, and definitely took advantage of it this time. My fettuccine alfredo also came with a ceasar salad.

While the salad was perfectly fine, I found that something seemed a little off with the bacon (words I thought I would never utter), but it didn't really stop me from enjoying it otherwise. The pasta was also perfectly cooked and delicious.

There were 2 things that prevented this place from getting 4 stars. One was that I wasn't given utensils when I was seated. I wasn't given utensils when the garlic bread arrived. I wasn't given utensils when the salad arrived. And had I not snatched utensils and a napkin from one of the empty tables a few feet away, I probably wouldn't have been given utensils when my pasta was served. Minor complaint, but I still think that's kind of lame.
The other was that when my pasta was served, it was on a dirty plate. Nearest I could tell, it looked like grease smeared in a few spots. Upon closer inspection, it only seemed to be on the outer edges of the plate, and not anywhere near the food, so I sucked it up and ate it. Besides, I didn't have time to send it back. It only takes about 2 seconds to wipe the plate before serving it. Pretty weak, even if you're trying to save the customer some time.

All in all, a decent experience, and I would return. Can't go wrong with unlimited garlic bread, a decent salad, and a plate of delicious pasta for only 12 bucks."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here for dinner and were seated pretty quickly but then waited 20 minutes to even get water or bread. We were totally ignored several times while the tables in front and behind of us were being served. Our server was a lady manager and she seemed
so relaxed but would never check up on our table. Overall food was meh and was either really salty or very bland. We were there for more than 2 hours and barely got any service the whole time. Would probably not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I have come here a couple times over the years, but it has always been about the same. I do enjoy the food they have here and that unlimited bread & soup/salad, but the service is definitely lacking.

First arrived and saw about 10 or so people waiting for a table. Not usually a problem but the restaurant was not busy at all. The hostess was super slow, took one table to sit down and didn't return to the front (even with a line of people waiting).

After sitting down the service was a little bit slow, but I don't blame the servers. They actually seemed like they were running around and super busy. The problem was that there weren't enough servers for the amount of people in the restaurant. They definitely seemed to be understaffed.

The food is always pretty good here though. Best is to have a friend get the soup and you get the salad and share so you can get both unlimited, then pack your pasta home for the next day!

Don't come here much, but willing to come back for the unlimited soup/salad. Other than that, the service is not all that great..."}
{"text":"Well the \"bread\" isn't Italian, the minestrone was from a can, and the iceberg lettuce was a pathetic excuse for a garden salad. I would imagine getting the staples of Italian cuisine would be top priority and pretty easy, but ESM Fails exponentially. Please, if you want real Italian food, or even something remotely Italian, call me and I'll invite you to one of my family dinners. Don't waste your money at East Side Marios."}
{"text":"The service was bad.  The waitress didn't know much about the items on the menu. Couldn't recommend anything but pizza. 
We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer. 
It Came out after our meal came out.
I ordered the Tuscan salad with mandarins.  
I came out with oranges that tasted fermented.  It was all iceberg lettuce.  My friends chicken parmesan was over cooked and his pasta was cold. 
The only thing I can say was good was the spinach and artichoke dip.  
I do not recommend going there."}
{"text":"Do NOT order delivery! Ordered last night via online ordering. Asked for debit at the door. Driver shows up more than an hour after ordering looking for cash. He said he didn't have a machine so could only accept cash. Finally we had to send him away with the food since we couldn't pay for it. My fiance' called the restaurant and talked to a manager to explain what happened. The manager was very apologetic, said they would cover our meal and he would personally bring it over. Another hour goes by and the doorbell rings. It was the original driver, not the manager. It was also our original food so it was totally cold. We paid for 2 orders with chicken but only 1 order came with it. We also ordered 2 shortcakes but only got one and it was literally the size of a roll of loonies. The food was bland and disappointing. It was nice they paid for our order which we appreciate but the quality and order accuracy was horrible. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"There has been a change in franchise ownership.  Immediate changes are obvious.  

The restaurant is apparently undergoing some massive renovations in June 2018.  I am looking forward to seeing how it looks (current look is th original kitschy style).

The food is chain-restaurant food.  No different than any other Cara Foods restaurant.  

Service is excellent all around and only better since the change in management."}
{"text":"Food is good. Large selection. Price okay. Overcrowd.  More like a family restaurant than a dating place. Good service.  Not bad if your hungry and dont look for a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"East Side bounces back. My previous experience was not a good one, however, I have not given up. ESM is the kind of organization that cares about customer experience, and tonight they proved it. Alex T. was my server, we were five people. His service was fantastic, the food was excellent and the kitchen service was very quick. The manager, not sure what her name is, was making sure all was in order. GREAT JOB ESM at Trinity-Commons. Keep it up! We will be back! (visit was Jan 24th at 6pm)"}
{"text":"Really love this location for East Side Mario's. They always give limitless bread and salad ( unlike other locations that skimp ) 

The service here is great and attentive. There are many good staff here who constantly check up on you and make sure your salad, water, coke and bread is replenished. 

The pasta is always good tasting and fresh tasting and not as if it were microwaved or canned. ( even tho I'm sure it probably is somewhat pre cooked or packaged) anyhow for a chain restaurant it still does meet the standard and consistency that many chains can't attain. 

I would suggest this as a great kids, family or casual friends meal for people in the Pickering area !"}
{"text":"It's been about 6 or 7 years since I was last at this East Side Mario's. My aunt and went out for dinner on Saturday night. I have to say, it was pretty darn good. I left with a stuffed tummy and a full wallet (my aunt paid!). 

We both thought it would be busier but we only waited about 5 minutes for our table. The place was bustling with quite a few groups that looked like it was family night out. 

We started with some stuffed mushroom caps which were fairly small but tasty. They also bring you your own little loaf of fresh bread. Love that! I had the garden salad with ranch dressing. The dressing was lacking in flavor but the salad portion was quite large. My aunt had the Italian wedding soup, which I also sampled. It was really good. She thought it was about the best she's ever had. 

Our main course arrived fairly quickly. I had one of the fettuccine dishes that won some award last year: grilled chicken, peppers, and mushrooms in a cream sauce. Ooooh was that yummy. My aunt had the chicken parmesan. It came with some penne in a tomato sauce. We both couldn't believe how big a piece of chicken she got. It looked like half a chicken! It was tasty but I thought it was a bit over done/too crispy for my linking. She loved it. 

The portions here are pretty big, although you do pay a decent price for them. We both had enough to take home. I was pleasantly pleased with my meal. Good food, good service, but a bit pricey for my liking."}
{"text":"I used to love East Side Marios. The suburban OGs will remember when it was in Oakville Place. The line ups were always long and the food was always delicious. 

Purely based on nostalgia I decided to eat dinner at East Side Mario's on Winston Park with my mom. The line up was as I remembered, long. We waited about half hour for our table. The hostess was lovely though. 

The menus could have used a cleaning. They felt greasy. Our server was extremely friendly, but it took forever to get our drinks and bring the debit machine. 

The endless garden salad and bread did not disappoint. So good! 

I couldn't believe how expensive this restaurant has become! My mom got the chicken parm and I got the lasagna. The portions were on the larger side. We both ended up taking leftovers home. 

The major downfall for us was the restaurant was incredibly noisy, like so noisy we couldn't wait to leave. It seems to be a favourite place for people to take their kids and let them scream and run around. Pretty sure this is a restaurant and not an indoor playground, just saying. I know this is something that the staff cannot control, but it really ruined the experience for my mom and I. 

Overall the food was good, but the service lacked. The ambiance was enough to make us never want to come back."}
{"text":"So let start by saying...get their zucchini fritti!! I love zucchini and I'm telling you, I just go to east sides just to have it.  It's so simply and the aioli they make that goes with it...yummy!! I'm drooling just thinking about it lol

Another thing is that no matter what time of day I go, I get great customer service overall.  I've probably caught a newbie in training once or twice so I'm a bit more understanding when it comes to that.  

I've been going to this location for many years and have seen the transitions in menu, the look of the restaurant, etc.  The most consistent for me is the overall customer service.  It's a nice place I can go to for last minute eats and it's worth the money to me.

With many restaurants I know menu items can change, my one recommendation is not to take items off the menu that work or are crows pleasers.  so PLEASE! don't take away the zucchini fritti away ever! Lol"}
{"text":"You know what? This place is delicious!  My kids and hubby love it and what's not to love? Kid's eat cheap/free, hubby gets unlimited cesaer salad and bread, I get Italian Wedding Soup... heck the pasta is bonus! hahaha!

Every time we come, the kid's have eaten a decent amount of salad and pasta. That makes it a very successful visit!"}
{"text":"Out for dinner with an out of town friend.  The wait time was said to be 15 minutes so we sat at bar and ordered a Corona and a Alexander Keith's.

We were seated exactly 15 minutes later in a booth.

Our first thought...unlimited soup and salad please!  The first round was delivered quickly filled by 30 minutes of nothing while we waited for a Basa Filet dinner and a Chicken Parmigiana entree.

Wait, at the 32 minute mark more salad and soup arrived followed by our main meal 1 minute later.  Uggg!!!"}
{"text":"Party of nine for a 5:30pm dinner with no reservations.  Waited 10 minutes to be seated. Came here for the buy one take one home free event.  Look, we've been here lots of time and we know that it's a hoot to have all you can ask for fresh bread loaves, soup, and/or salad before settling down on your entree of choice which many people just take home afterwards because they can't eat it all.  The service was great considering the staff all know our motives --- load up on the bread, soup and salad!  Just don't insult them by wasting food like your mama told you time and time again.  The food is good for the price range so don't expect high end home made pasta cuisine.  You can get Scene points and use your discount coupons if you have any.  It's predictable and we're all fine with it every time we eat here!"}
{"text":"Have always come to this place! Recently the place has become pathetic with very bad customer service ..

Been going to this place for the past 7 years. First time, got a hair in my soup and response was like it it happens and was asked to pay the full bill even with no sorry from the manager. 

Never coming back!!!! Wish I can give no stars.. 

Btw- ordered all u can eat soup salad and penne arabiata pasta."}
{"text":"Not my first time trying East Side Marios, and won't be my last. Came in on the weekend expecting the patio to be packed but was delighted it was clear as day. Cant complain about anything - $5 beer, 16 layer lasagne, and the kids mac and cheese tasted pretty damn good to me. Our waiter was a cheerful cutie bear and food came out fast!"}
{"text":"We had a really good birthday experience at East side Mario's. They gave us super nice attention and all the staff was really open and friendly. We got there around 8 pm on a Tuesday, and there was no wait for 6 people. The decor gives off a italian pasta/pizza restaurant feel. 

Their menu didn't have a lot of unique vegetarian options, but there was a bunch of things that could be customizable to be vege. 

The complimentary bread is always so yummy. It's my favorite part of the experience. So soft and the butter really works well with it. 

We ordered the steak but since they didn't have the option they instead gave two slices of chicken, which was really nice of them. 

We also ordered the pasta and the fried eggplant. Both very delicious. Their pasta is definitely unique I think they make it from scratch in house.

We got free dessert which was a yummy chocolate sundae and the nice staff members sang us happy birthday. So cute!"}
{"text":"First time we went here the waitress forgot to bill us a coke so she got extra tip from us. My baby Loves this place she loves huge bread and pasta and I love the Cesar salad! Last time I had the baked penne bolognese it was great! Husband had the the seafood linguini with no complaints serves was pretty fast and they gave us bread and refill his pop without asking!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on a Sunday afternoon when the weather was nice so I knew the restaurant would be busy, especially because every east side's I've been to, there has always been a wait. The hostess was very nice and she was really working hard, I wish I got her name to give her a shoutout.

My waitress was Mercedes, and she had a very nice attitude even with the stress of being understaffed and having less time to focus on each table. I knew she was doing the best she could which is why little things such as not getting the bread after we asked for it, I let slide. 

The previous reviews are definitely accurate when they talk about the location being understaffed, and I think this location should really hire more servers because not everyone is as understanding about what a server has to go through and it can really affect their tips.

Regarding the food itself, I think because it was so busy the food was not properly rationed the way it normally would be ( I got shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with Caesar salad) and it was pretty small compared to how it is normally.

Overall, great experience but definitely could be better. Hopefully the restaurant is appreciating their servers like Mercedes because they're really doing good work!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My boyfriend and I love the East Side Mario's Franchise, but this is the worst one we have ever been to. Ryan, the bartender, is absolutely terrible. Did not check on us once, demanded for payment right away, and forgot half of our orders for all you can eat soup. Never asked us if we wanted another drink, nor if we wanted dessert. Extremely disappointed. If you come here, do not eat in the bar area!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. I have ordered take out here a few times, right after having a baby it was hard to go anywhere with my colicky newborn and what new mom has time to cook. The pasta from takeout was terrible, tasted like water kind of soapy I called to complain and nothing was done. So decided to dine in now that my son is over a year old. The first waitress named Cassandra I think, was amazing. She brought a toy for my son to keep him occupied so I could enjoy a much needed lunch date with a friend. However the second time I came on Mother's Day and it was super busy of course but when we were finally seated the waitress was running around like a chicken with no head. She brought only one water when we asked for 2. Then she forgot some of our items. As we were eating our pasta we asked for 2 more garlic breads. It's supposed to be unlimited... Of course she forgot them. Then she brought the bill and we reminded her of the bread and she said since we were finished our meal she couldn't give us any. We had asked earlier it was her fault she forgot and she did nothing to make it to right. Terrible service most of the time would not recommend."}
{"text":"By far the single worst franchise in Ontario. Food can barely be classified as food. It is all complete garbage. Microwaved, frozen dinners at $20 a plate. Quite literally inedible by any standards. The only people who enjoy it are people who want to stuff their faces with all you can eat bread and salad. I have no idea how this franchise is still alive."}
{"text":"Sadly, a couple other locations have shut down that I used to go to but I'm glad this East Side Mario's is still around!

I've been a few times and have had take out too.  I went today with a party of 7 (and two babies).  Our waitress was very attentive and quick, which was very much appreciated.  I've always had good to great service here, so it wasn't as much of a surprise to me.

The food was delicious as always.  I got the shrimp bow tie pasta, which was really good.  It has a nice little spicy kick that I love.

The only down side is parking.  The parking lot is huge since it is at the Markville mall.  When the mall is busy you may have to park a fair distance away.

Overall, it was a great experience as per usual.  I find the prices to be really good considering most meals come with soup and garlic loaves.  It's also great with kids since you can get in an out quickly!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give a higher rating but the service is sub-par.

Went here for dad's bday on a Wednesday. We were greeted by a gentleman and told us to wait. We waited for at least 10-15 mins to get seated. The restaurant was quite empty btw.

Finally we sat at a booth and our server greeted us. She wasn't the most enthusiastic server, however, she got our orders right. It took her a while to come to our table to and take our order. She only checked up on us once during our meal.

Before ordering, we told her it's my dad's bday and she didn't acknowledge it. She just mentioned that you get free dessert with that.

Food is tasty and flavorful. The bread is refillable and the portion was quite big compared to other restaurants. Everything came out at a reasonable time. 

As our dessert came, she told us that she sent her staff home so there wouldn't be any singing. Meanwhile, the other table received a birthday song a few minutes before we ordered the dessert. 

We didn't come to East Side Mario's for other ppl to sing happy bday to my dad or to feel like royalty, but they should least acknowledge it so patrons/customers would feel \"special\" in some way. We chose that restaurant for my dad to have a good time, yet, everything went downhill simply because of the service. We felt like we were a bother to our server.

As for pricing, it's quite decent. Make sure you use your coupon! 

Overall, this location and chain is a good place to eat but the service SHOULD definitely improve."}
{"text":"FOOD WAS SO SO....soup seemed like ur typical canned soup, pasta was half decent. Wouldn't waste my money on food here again. Okay for occasional drinks but there are always good bars for that out there."}
{"text":"Ordered the spaghetti and meatball pasta. I didn't enjoy it at all. It's not that it tasted bad, it's just that I think I've been spoiled by other restaurants. Restaurants such as Scaddabush taste 10x better and are often similar in pricing.

I only came to East Side Mario because of their unlimited soup promotion. It turned out that I didn't even like the soup, I never ordered it more than once anyways."}
{"text":"Very vert poor service tonight! We used to enjoy coming here but it has been many instances of under staff and wrong order/missing order items. When we first walked in today, there are no one at the door to greet us, we see many empty table inside thinking we will be seated soon. It took about 10 mins and we waiting another 10 mins at the table to order. We had to remind the greeter we are ready to order but we do not know who our server is. 

Finally we placed our orders... I give the star to our waiter tonight... He might be slow showing up (maybe new staff) but he was very fast bringing extra breads, soup/salad and drinks. 

The food is not the best Italian food but we do enjoy the embience... down sides are that the pasta portion size isn't as big as before... Kids meal always come out half cold (pasta all chunked up together)... My favorite dish is Basa filet but the vege portion also shrunk. I can fill up another plate of side salad after my dish. Maybe I should make myself a filet sandwich instead with the free bread.

Not sure if we will come back to this location again. Improve service both greeter and kitchen staff is a must!"}
{"text":"The food is decent. Not the best, gourmet pastas but what you can expect for $10? For the price it's good value. Lots of real bacon for the caesar salad. Good place for vegetarians because you can make your own pasta. There's a $9.99 special on until May 9th...normally it's $13.99."}
{"text":"Let's face it it's a chain.

The decor is nice, the price point is good when considering the quality of the food, but there is nothing vibrant about this place.

Pretty consensual dinning experience with an Italian twist.

Because the place is big you can have a bit more ''drama'' without pestering the rest of the crowd and vice versa.

I can clearly remember seeing a ton of kids, yet can't remember hearing them. 

When factoring how well pulled together the decor, the food and the ambiance are that's a 4."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant but I'm afraid the quality is slipping. I used to go here at least once a month but I think moving forward I'm going to spend my hard earned money elsewhere. Firstly the server didn't even tell me about the \"take the second meal home\" promotion that ESM's spends so much time and money promoting. After I ordered my meal, i called over my serve and they said \"Oh ya we have that promotion going on but the meal you ordered isn't part of that promo\". When my meal came out they asked if I wanted parmesan cheese, I said yes, they went back to the kitchen to retrieve the cheese and never returned. My chicken Alfredo fettuccini was extremely bland and tasteless and the pasta was over cooked. If management's willing to provide me with a gift card, I'll give this location another chance. Otherwise I'm afraid they're going to lose a customer."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and attentive. The garlic bread (unlimited) was very soft - just wish it was more garlic-y. The chicken tetrazini pizza was so so - didn't love the green onions added to the pizza and I think they were trying to make that recipe less soggy (apparently a number of customers complained About it being soggy) so I didn't really taste any sauce (it was supposed to have alfredo sauce). The bottomless caesar salad had real bacon bits (and a good portion of it) which was nice."}
{"text":"Seriously, where are the vegetarian options? All the dishes (even the salads) have either meat, fish, poultry or eggs in them. I have heard that this place is good from my friends but I can't join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. Vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. Sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. There are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. I'll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian/vegan menu in place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal for lunch. My Caesar Wrap was terrible. Who ever thought that grilling caesar salad in a wrap would be appealing? Limp, hot lettuce with a sub-par dressing. Huge fail, and they should take it off the menu immediately. Bad choice on my part. 
Our fettuccini alfredo had almost no sauce and we had to ask for more.
They still get three stars because of their excellent table service."}
{"text":"I'm not really too sure why this place is still in business when the food and wait times is terrible. 

I ordered the Classic Calamari Fritti and the Risso Italiano. The calamari was extremely bland and the risso was watery. I can't. I can't stomach this place!

The only reason why I'm writing a review was because of the friendly service my friend and I received. Our server's name was Jeff and he was very funny, attentive and super polite. We waited quite a bit for our food to come and he kept apologizing and updating us as to when our food was coming. 

All in all, Jeff made the entire experience great. However, I will not be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Made a reservation for 16 people and regret doing so. 

This is the 3rd time we have had an awful experience at this location. 

The food is always pretty good, however the service absolutely obliterates any chances of this place succeeding. 

Our server was not only beyond rude and dismissive, but she made several mistakes with no apology. As a group of 16, we didn't expect to have fast service, but a bit of attention isn't asking much. 

My salad had plenty of withered/rotting leaves to top it off. The manager is a dismissive jerk who has no clue/knowledge of how to run a busy restaurant. He's absolutely so rude. 

Won't be hurrying back again."}
{"text":"Over the years this location has gotten better in terms of food. I went here just the other day and I have to say the food was good, however the service was atrocious. In the beginning a man came to take our order and he was wonderful! I believe after placing our order, his shift was over and some lady took over his tables. For the next hour and a half I felt like we were trapped in east side Marios. She was nowhere to be seen and I had to go back to the kitchen to find someone to get our bill. When I asked to use debit, she left and took another 15-20 minutes to come back despite the fact that the restaurant was empty as it was Thursday  at 3 o'clock. The food was fine but the service made the experience terrible. This was the first time I've gone back in years because of previously having a similar experience."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the pros: good service, good atmosphere and got a table right away. 

Cons: oven was broken down and not was not mentioned to us until I ordered a large pizza (which needed it). So I had to ask the server for more time to look at the menu some more. They were able to make the smaller size pizza but the crust tasted like playdough. Not sure if that had anything to do with the broken oven or the ingredients in the crust or something else.. 

Otherwise they give a nice amount of toppings on the pizza! And the Italian wedding soup is delicious  

The cookie dessert is served cold..? everywhere we go and get the cookie it's warmed up and the ice cream melts on it. Not here. I did not enjoy that cookie at all."}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch and it was great. The servers were attentive and friendly. Food was actually good this time. We ordered the pizza and a penne dish. Came on time and not cold. Overall, everything seemed fine until they actually started getting busy and it seemed a little hectic for us. Waited for a bit for our bill which didn't help since we needed to leave. Would come back."}
{"text":"The only word I can think of this place is meh. 

It has been years since last time and it is going to be at least five more until I forget I hate this place. 

Below average food, crappy costumer service. It feels much like going to mcD but being served. Another Cara wonder..."}
{"text":"Seriously they need customer service training. 

First problem: They refused to offer free kid meal (Mon to Wed) with a $10 off coupon card that they accepted last week. Manager dropped by only admitted it was a mistake.

Second problem: the server kept educating us their policy. I asked if a kid drink was refillable. She said no.  Added only pop is. Came back with an apple juice  that we paid for and told us again: pop is refillable, not milk and not juice.  

Overall experience was unwelcome.  Often time when she could not understand my request, her immediate reply was \"What?\"

This will likely my last visit."}
{"text":"I like East Side Marios in general, the only reason this location wont get 5 stars from me is because the owners seem to hate having staff. Everytime I go there (especially last night) the waitress's and bartenders are run ragged running around trying to help everyone. 
The food was what it was supposed to be, and our waitress was DEFINITELY trying her best, I done seen it"}
{"text":"Updated review

Came here on Mon night. I was disappointed.
Had salad, calamari, shrimp fettuccine
Only the salad was good.

Calamari was refried/reheated after sitting there during the weekend - dry, rubbery, soggy

Shrimp pasta - sauce had a funny after taste, bitter, sour, pasta tasted stale, stuck together in a bunch on the plate like old pasta does

Food was cold when it was served

Next day, I had diarrhea that lasted the entire day.

I don't think I will return again for a long time.

Service was acceptable. Otherwise, I will give this place a 1 star

Decent menu & Italian food 

Always lots of salad & bread

Price is good

Friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"Work lunch with group of 8, we arrived at noon and there was two alternate tables. Decor is all similar at this chain restaurant.... The waiter arrived and asked us if we were ready to order; she brought over a small loaf of bread.

We were waiting now 10 minutes before she came over so we were ready to order. She took our drinks and food order and then brought drinks out shortly after.

You can order some of the dinner items on their lunch menu, smaller portion and a few $$$$ less. We asked for more bread twice and she kept brining out one load. If I was her I would have brought a few so she did not have to come back every time... 

Good came out and it was well presented. I always get chicken tetrazzini, I asked for gluten free penne but got spaghetti noodles. She asked if I wanted the penne but I dident bother. She ran out of cheese and said if u want more I can get more but it may be a while... We said it was fine because she seemed busy.

The food is ok and the service was ok, I think if she wrote down orders she won't make so many small mistakes.

Still better service than most places but should step it up as there are many options to eat in the area!"}
{"text":"East Side Marios franchise seemed to hit the restaurant scene when alot of those themed restaurants popped up. You know the kind with decent food, cheap prices, endless salad & bread and young waiters with about as much experience as your younger sister. 
This Marios follows the formula,  highly themed restaurant ( almost like a theme park ride) food that is ok, and that wont kill your pocketbook. 
Service is cheerful, prompt and efficient. The menu is varied but fairly typical... pizza,pasta, italian sandwiches etc. The food is tasty and what my friends would call  \"cheap and cheerful\".
This particular one never seems to be busy at lunch time. Having said that, I always think its a good idea to take a working lunch at 1130 or 1145 to avoid any rush of customers. 
There is plenty of free parking out front. 
Oh yah, and endless soup, salad, bread, drinks......."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely atrocious especially for the prices they were asking for. The service was fine, but at this price point and being in downtown Toronto, I expected better quality. I would not eat here again and I recommend you look elsewhere for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Apparently before we came in a 45 person party came in. When we walked in the server who finally came to see what we were doing at the front, she acted annoyed we would dare to show up while they were busy. We were sat, but the poor waitress was so overwhelmed that it took forever to get our order. We ordered from the gluten friendly menu, which we know means that it is gluten free pasta but made near other pasta so could have some gluten on it. After my wife ate hers she went into a gluten overload. She has a condition that when she eats gluten that makes her body basically shut down. This only happens if she has major gluten overload. We will never be back. Obviously its not a gluten friendly menu, its a \" this gluten thing is just a fad, lets put that its gluten friendly to get the health nuts\" menu. Never will be back. Obviously a mangement issue. Thanx for ruining our Saturday."}
{"text":"Overall the food was not awful.  I was glad to see they had a gluten friendly option for their pizza crust, but the pizza didn't have much cheese on it.  The cheese they put on after the fact was very good however.  Just not many gluten free options so I have to give at least 3 stars since they are trying.  Atmosphere is good, and waitress was nice.  We did wait a while at the front door to be seated when we arrived however.  Overall the menu looked extensive, since I had never been to an east side before."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their soup and desserts. Always looking forward to it. I love their tomato soup, their build your own pasta menu, and their desserts. They have 3 different soups now; Italian Wedding, Tomato and Minestrone soup. They also have pizza on their menu. For desserts, I usually get their peanut butter stack (half/full). It's really filling on it's own. Very chewy, and sweet. The service is very nice, friendly, and very clean. CAA members get 10% off. You just have to show your card, they will take it and verify it. They also do the Scene points too. Yes, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"One word to sum everything up: Y I K E S

Absolutely yikes. To my disdain, my little sister requested that we go to this establishment for lunch. Cool. 

The hostess messed up as soon as we sat down in our booth. She gave everyone else the right menus. Guess what I got? A lunch menu! JUST the lunch menu. While all the other adults got their normal menu and lunch menu. I thought, \"Wow. This place really cut down on their menu selections over time.\" Strike one.

The server barely interacted with us. She got us water. Left for a while. 

Mediocre food. And mediocre food that I had to reach over and take from her hand. She couldn't have placed it down??? And she didn't even ask me to take the plate of food from her hand. She just looked at me awkwardly, while I shot her an awkward look back at her. 

I could have paid $15 for pasta and service better than this in the downtown core (Toronto). 

Not once did she ask how our food was. It seemed like we had to wait 30 minutes for our food. And another 20 minutes waiting for her to come around, while she served three other tables CONTINUOUSLY. 

I was once a server, so I don't think I can excuse this. Jeez. 

Lastly, WOW the worst thing of all. We wanted to pay via debit. So tada, she produced a debit machine and the total. But no receipt! NO RECEIPT! That drove me nuts. I need to look at the receipt to look at everything and review it before I pay for my meal. What if I was paying for some other table's meal and I just didn't know it?

As people my age say: I WAS SHOOK.  SHOOKETH!

Stay away from mediocre food, terrible terrible service. And this is coming from a former server."}
{"text":"The place was pretty busy on a Thursday night so my fiancee and myself decided to sit at a bar table. Had we wanted to wait in the queue it was around an hour and a half. Luckily out of the corner of my eye I saw a spot open up and we nabbed it. 

Not bad tasting food and plenty of flare to make this place feel like an Italian restaurant. However, they apparently spent a lot of money on the decorations because the prices are just a smidge high, even for being in a city like Toronto.  When I look at the Starters section and I see that an establishment is selling garlic bread and cheese for 7.50$, an item that some places give away free as a side to compliment your dish, something is askew.  The pasta dish I ordered came out quickly and tasted good, I just wish I wasn't staring at a tasty plate of flour, water, chopped tomatoes, various herbs and spices for 14 dollars.  The serving staff was prompt, friendly and knew their information on specials. The bartender had many suggestions on different drinks he could whip together and all in all we had a great time here and would probably be back again at some point."}
{"text":"Disappointing. For some reason I remember East Sides as being better than this. The food was bland, runny pasta sauce, and they got rid of their yummy vegetable soup. Our server never showed up and another server had to cover for her. Which meant long waits before and after our meal. The restaurant wasn't even that packed. I think this franchise may be on it's way out! There are many other options in this area I would recommend you try before going here."}
{"text":"Nothing special here... I mean if you can't think of anywhere else it wouldn't be the worst. The food was average, price was more than fair. Long story short don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"WOW! i went for a birthday dinner lastnight that one of my best girl friends took me to!! Our waiter was FANTAASTIC! best service! He sat us down gave us prompt service and even asked if there was anything special for the day! My birthday of course! I got a song, a spin the wheel and even won a free lunch!! wow! to top it off we all got complimented a few times, very pleasant service! 

I will go forever to this resteraunt because he did such a fantastic job! We sat close to the enterance in a booth right by the first window to the left from the door around 6:30 pm on jan 11/2013. Our waiter, recieves 10 stars + 1 bonus. We didnt even have to ask, he was on top of it all!

Thanks for making this better service and made me enjoy my special day way better than THE KEG @ bramalea city centre!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and mediocre service. This location was good for the longest time but my previous two visits have been awful. From frozen meatballs to canned sauce, it seems like it's never an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this East Side's location. We hadn't been to an East Side Marios in over 6 years and decided to go for my sisters birthday. We were seated fairly quickly (it would have been quicker but we wanted a booth). After sitting we met our wonderful server (we regret not getting her name again). She was very courteous and gave us our menus and told us about what was popular. We ended up ordering the cheese  capelleti and chicken parmigana. We were first given loaves of bread, then our appetizers (free soup and/or salad). Then we got our meals. I was so full by the time we were halfway done and had to get it packed. My sister was also given a birthday Sunday which was delicious! She didnt want a group singing for her so our server did a personal happy birthday song. Best customer service ever. She gave us our boxes and we paid and went on our way. Overall, it's a superb location, with very kind people working there and the food is also very good. It gets busy there quickly so expect a crowd on the weekends. We will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location once before - we came then for the pasta and a movie night. Buy their pasta special and you get a movie ticket. The service was quite good and the pasta, surprising good as well. Got a movie ticket out of the deal and watched a great movie. Very positive experience.

This time... not so much... 

We came last night for dinner. WE being my wife and our two kids, 8 & 6. We were seated quickly. As we were being seated I had my 8 year old whisper into the hostess's ear, \"It's my mom's birthday dinner.\" The hostess smelled, nodded and gave me a wink.

I made an assumption that this info would be passed onto our server and we could collaborate a surprise birthday dessert. Nothing happen, not even an inquiry from our server.

Our server came soon after and took our order. The kids ordered theirs, we ordered ours. My wife and I both went for the steak sandwich - she ordered the sweet potato fries, me the potato wedges. We ordered wings as an appetizer.

Shortly after ordering our meals arrived... before the wings... 

Note, the kids food - and later their root beer floats - all arrived on time and in their words, \"This is awesome.\"

The 6oz steak sandwiches that we ordered... they were terrible. I'd never order it again, nor would I recommend it. It was extremely thin, like a minute steak. We ordered medium rare but there wasn't enough thickness to the steak to even notice. It was thin and rubbery, and served on what looked like the top half of a hamburger bun. 

Disappointing. I wasn't expecting a KEG steak but I was expecting a steak.

My wife was also disappointed in the serving size of her sweet potato fries - the amount was that of a medium order of McDonalds fries. Not a bad thing, they tasted good, just an observation.

My potato wedges were soggy and oily. Not tasty at all.

Half way through our meal we asked about our wings order. \"Oh, right.\" the servers said. By the time we finished our less than appetizing meal, still no wings. We caught our servers attention and cancelled the order. She looked shocked and frustrated... at us or the kitchen, we would never learn.

We asked for our bill. Paid. Left. Disappointed.

In the defence of our server and the restaurant, they never learned how we truly felt about our experience so they will never have a chance to make it better - at least for us that is.

My advice to the restaurant - use these less than positive reviews to improve the menu, staff training and the customer's experience. Not everything about this review is negative..."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner with a family of 6.  Dinner was excellent and the staff was very nice and friendly.  Would certainly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The place is nice, I had a late dinner there, which resulted in a slightly soggy calamari, but the pasta was really well made and rated excellent. I really liked this place because of the people that work here. They are so kind, polite and hard working individuals, and created a very comfortable space for me to dine."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I came here. At first after I sat down i wanted to order right away and the waitress didn't come for 7 min. That's because I was hungry and eager for food lol. After ordering the bread and salad was good. I ate 2 bowl of Caesar salad. Then AYCE pasta day (wednesday) I had 3 plate of spaghetti lol. The waitress was busy but she was quick. Every time I finish a plate she got me another quickly. The spaghetti was pretty good consider its only $11.99 AYCE. I would come back again on Wednesday."}
{"text":"Wow, worst restaurant experience ever. Ate in the bar for the \"Appy\" Hour, they only have one bartender working and expect him to bus tables and take orders from all the bar patrons and make the drinks for the entire resaurant. It took 30 minutes to get my nachos and my girlfriends salad. After and hour the pasta and bread loaf never came. Even after the bar tender asked what the order was a second time. Instead of waiting we asked to take it off the bill and cancel the order. Unfortunatley I had to leave a bad tip, but someone has to take responsibility for this awful service. Another note to mention was that the tables beside us were not bussed for the entire hour we were there and they sat in a disgusting state. Familys that were there got served before us, when we had arrived at least 15 minutes before them. I will never go to a East Side Mario's again, what a shame they used to have a higher level of service."}
{"text":"Everything is extra. Extra sauce, extra pay. There's no longer all you can eat salad with any pasta or entree. It's extra $3.99 on anything other than dinner sized pasta menu.  I did end up ordering the lasagna doubled up and asked for sauce on top. Extra pay for sauce. Service was crap. Place looked all right but everything was crap. Even this review is crap, which resembles the crap place and service here. The server started coughing all over the table like she choked when I commented everything here is extra pay.  After, I got scared to ask for water or salad with bacon. Because it's probably extra pay and the place is crap.  It's the type of service where you get the uneasy feeling they'd spit on your food. Crap. Do not go here, it's crap. Yes, the word crap is used for emphasis on this review."}
{"text":"Good experience here.  The server was friendly and attentive.  He brought us refills without asking.  He smiled at us.  I've had bad experience with East Side Mario's chain lately or maybe I should say, to my recollection, since I first started going to this chain, so maybe my standards aren't too high.  The food however, is still bleh, nothing to boast about.

They have a good deal going on here, $12.99 for unlimited soup or pasta and garlic loaf with either a pasta (with meat!!) or a pizza (two toppings!).  I would not personally choose to go to this place to ever, but it was this great deal that coaxed my fam members who I was meeting for dinner to come.  This time I wasn't disappointed and may even go back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday night. When we got there we were told half hour wait. We decided to wait at the bar. Within 10 minutes we were called to our table. That's were our luck ended. 
Value is always great and good was average however service was definitely not worth the 15% tip that was left. We were never asked if we wanted refills on our salad, bread or soups. Dirty dishes were left on the table and with our left overs the waitress brought a take out container but then put the black holder with our bill inside THE TAKE OUT CONTAINER !!! Yuck talk about germs!!!!
A very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend for dinner to catch up on our lives, spent 5 minutes at the door waiting for the hostess to show up and seat us. Our server was very friendly and happy to serve us but the overall service was slow; the restaurant wasn't that busy at 7:30pm. My grilled salmon was delicious, and I love the AYCE salad!! If I'm not in a hurry, I'd definitely come back! But service needs to be a little faster."}
{"text":"I love East Side Mario's as a guilty pleasure. AYCE bread is right up my alley. I popped in here around 7 PM on a sunny Saturday night and it only took 10 mins to get seated. The food was standard fare. Being a major chain it doesn't vary much coast to coast. Our server was hilarious. I like witty staff, adds to the experience. The only really odd thing I noticed was that I received my pasta entree before my salad. I'm the sort that likes to eat them together anyway so not a big deal. I'd go back. One of the better experiences I've had with the chain."}
{"text":"Service was actually so bad...Im really not sure what happened here. I was Here a few months back and maybe the staff is all new but this was really terrible service. The unlimited salad was dry and pathetic and the server continually forgot to bring the parmesan to go on top and unfortunately that is a staple of east side Mario's. We asked several times. She would ask us if we wanted bread then wouldn't bring it? They had lots of staff members and I can't for the life of me figure out why they wouldn't be attentive to the only big table of 6 in the place...she kept avoiding our gestures to come over. Then when it came time to pay she didn't split the bills for each of us to have a copy aaaand she put my friends drink on our bill when she was the person who took my friends order and brought her her drink...extremely disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Only writing this review after a number of decent visits and then having one pretty bad one. Service was okay but basically had the bill be the fastest thing that came to the table. Foods decent. Prices match the food. Cant really go wrong. Just expect some dry salad and forgetful service sometimes"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants! I've never had a negative experience at East Side Mario's. Is it authentic Italian food? No....but it tastes amazing!! I love that they give you unlimited bread and soup or salad :). For birthdays, a group of waiters come to your table to sing you their chant together while clapping. Kind of embarrassing for the birthday person but it's always nice to watch lol. I recommend the Alfredo dishes, lasagne and chicken parmesan...so good!  

Will always go back and will always recommend East Side Mario's."}
{"text":"This location is horrible. We first went to this location and waited 10mins in front and didn't get any host or server to bring us to a table or even ask if we were taken care of and they saw us come in and just looked at us.. I suggest going to GREAT LAKE LOCATION. they have better manager, host and server and they are on point with everything"}
{"text":"So where to start.. we got there at 11pm an hour before closing so it was very quiet. But you can see that some of the servers weren't interested in seating us. One of the male server saw us but continued his conversation with on of his colleagues but after a while he came asked us how many and said just sit next to the bar..

 But I was very impressed with the gentleman that was working behind the bar he was the server that took care of us and others tables.. it didn't take him a long time to ask what we wanted to drink and when my boyfriend wasn't sure he gave us time but also came back in a good time matter so that were not waiting long.. my boyfriend got a beer and I just got water.

we order:
CALAMARI AL DIAVOLO
Lightly seasoned calamari with garlic, onions, red, green and hot cherry bomb peppers served in a tomato broth on a
sizzlin' skillet.

HELL'S KITCHEN CHICKEN
Two seasoned chicken scaloppini simmered
with roasted button mushrooms, tomatoes,
chilli peppers and a zesty tomato broth.

LINGUINE CHICKEN TETRAZZINI
Tons of seasoned chicken breast, roasted
button mushrooms, fresh bruschetta, white wine and fresh garlic tossed in Alfredo sauce.

So their calamari were òk not awesome but òk thought it was way too greasy for an dish in a sizzling plate wish it was more calamari then cooked onions on the bottom.. Hells Kitchen Chicken was good not spicy enough for my boyfriend but good. And the tetazzini isn't how I use to remember it they use to use Cherry tomatoes now they just used diced tomatoes.. both our main dishes came with unlimited soup or salad I tried their roasted garlic tomato soup (just to try somethjng new) which I found tasted more like just tomato sauce soup out of the can I switch after to their Italian since it's the only soup I like from there and my boyfriend had the ceasear salad which had alot of bacon which is a plus..

Portion size they got smaller which I don't really think is good especially your paying $70 for to main dishes one appetizer and one drink.. Overall experience was òk not the greatest but òk some things they need to work on is with some of the servers their alertness to customers and not drinking while customers can see them.."}
{"text":"Great service, good price and quality food considering the $11.99 promotion that is currently on-going until November 26th. Haven't been here in ages as there aren't many of these chains remaining, but am happy I stopped in with a friend. Service was a bit slow in terms of getting a table (everything is done manually; there should really be an iPad or electronic monitoring as there were around 5 free tables, yet a 30 minute wait). Definitely will be back though. Reservations recommended for weekends."}
{"text":"Summary: they make unlimited garlic bread and Caesar salad feel very, very limited when they have only one server during a lunch rush - food quality was never a strength here, and looks like food QUANTITY has nosedived as well.

Top Must-Get: a SCENE points card
Top Regret: unlimited caesar salad

I don't blame the server. I really don't. The manager that decided to staff one server during lunchtime? Insane. 

When four colleagues and myself got here for our lunch meeting, we were one of two tables. We got served pretty quickly, and the server kindly accommodated us when we asked to move to a bigger table, and took our order fairly quickly. But other folks started coming - and before you knew it, there were about 10 tables. 

Three of my colleagues ordered the unlimited caesar salad. They got their first set about 20 minutes in (a SALAD... I mean, in that time, I think it would've been faster to walk to Wal-mart, buy the ingredients, and make it ourselves at someone's house). Naturally, then, my spaghetti and meatball took even longer.

The good news about salad is that it doesn't have to be served hot; my pasta, though, was lukewarm by the time it got to me, and the portion size was so small I'm pretty sure I swallowed more disappointment than I did food.

Listen, the meatballs didn't taste BAD - but if I have to wait 25+ minutes for a meal, I'm going to have slightly higher expectations (AND I'll be hungrier).

East Side's was never known for being super high quality - it is the QUANTITY that we hoped to focus on... but that didn't work out this time.
I mean, the \"unlimited\" caesar salad for three people ended up being a total of four caesar salads. We left hungry and probably won't come back.

However, East Side's does have a Scene Points deal this month (February 2017) - if you'd like a chance to be entered into a draw for a MILLION scene points, you should check it out. And maybe delivery is better? I'm not really sure."}
{"text":"When I think of East Sides, I can't help but belt out their theme song.. East side Mario's, East side Mario's, bing-bada-bing-bada-boom! That song catches on and stays in your head like wildfire. 

I love East Sides, when I go into their restaurant, I just become all happy inside. Their decor is so inviting and just lively! Overall, it's just a great family restaurant, but also a place to bring a bunch of friends to chat it out for a few hours.  

East Sides, I would say is the Canadian version of the Olive Garden. I love the Olive Garden too, so that's why I can make the comparison.  At East Sides, with every dinner entree you order, you get either soup (minestrone or italian wedding) or salad (garden house salad) - unlimited.  I love their salad to death. If you like your salad lite on the dressing, you may not enjoy this version of salad.  

You also get unlimited garlic loafs. It's served on a wooden chopping block with a side of whipped butter. A few slices of bread, with salad and you're a happy camper before the main dish even comes! The main courses are pretty decent. I wouldn't call them the bomb, but it's good restaurant style Italian food."}
{"text":"5 out 6 meals were unsatisfactory. Not enough chicken in chicken pasta plate. Chicken sandwich meat in club and only two slices. Not very clean restaurant. Service was great though. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for a Thanksgiving brunch, weird idea I know. I had a chicken club. It was ok, I hate to say that but I had thanksgiving leftovers at home!!!! Service was good and everything was fine."}
{"text":"Lunch was very disappointing this time!

I asked about the AYCE Wed Pasta and was informed by the server it's not available which is a surprise since I see it on the front page of their website.

I ended up ordering a regular lunch item and it was SMALL.  It's like a kids meal size lol....and no side dishes (unless u count the garlic bread).  I will give the food quality a decent grade but the quantity was really, really TINY.   We left half full....if we were able to order the webadvertised AYCE Pasta that would not be the case!!"}
{"text":"This is truly a mixed experience that requires the review to be done in three parts. Front/Food/Server

Seating-Is there any negative star????
There were two total incompetent hostesses that was pacing and walking around the restaurant aimlessly.  No smile, no greeting, just walking around!!!   They are chatting and walking together????   The front waiting area was full of people BUT the inside seating area had THIRTEEN empty tables????   And the hostess had no interest in seating people.  They kept us standing for over 15 mins when half the restaurant was empty.....

Food- the stuffed pizza (a bit small for a $15 price) and Chicken and Veal Parmesan was decent.  Not great but decent.  The kitchen was quite quick in preparing the food and hence not a long wait after the order was placed.  Temperature was good and it was tasty.  The soup and salad was quite good-especially when you factor in its all you can eat.  I would give it a 3 star here.

The server was also quite good-prompt and polite.   Despite being very busy, she managed to multitask quite effectively.  A 3.

Unfortunately the front shop set the stage for a poor dining experience."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful... My boyfriend and I entered the restaurant, starving and eager to eat. This is 2pm on a Friday afternoon, the restaurant wasn't busy with only 2 other patrons eating. The waitress ignored us for 10 minutes before begrudgingly seating us. There was no \"hi, sorry for the wait\" just leaving the menus in a pile at the table. If possible, this restaurant wouldn't get any stars, and needless to say we walked out without eating."}
{"text":"This used to be our place to stop for lunch when we shopped in the area and I must've been there a dozen times. Generally eating cheap Italian food like this makes you feel kind of shitty in the end but that's something we always factored in as it's expected so that's fine - the food is reasonably tasty for the price.

Recently we ate there and suddenly my wife literally had to run to the bathroom to throw up. The food didn't taste off or anything and we thought maybe she ate too fast or maybe the food was too heavy as she ate very little in the morning. 

As we were leaving I went to the men's washroom and one of the sinks was full of vomit. I notified the management about this - when there are around 10 people in the restaurant and two cases of throwing up at the same time it's not an accident anymore. The management basically told us that it can't be their food, everything's done fresh etc. and added \"but thanks for telling us\". 

It was clear at this point that no responsibility is taken - or even admission that it could potentially be their food that's causing the problem. Of course it's possible that two customers out of 10 happen to throw up for some other reason within 30 minutes - but the chances are pretty close to zero.

I walked out and will not be back. I simply can't reward an establishment that flat out denies the possibility of their food being defective and offers no compensation (or even a partial refund..!) for a ruined day and the humiliation of throwing up in the public. I see now why past comments have multiple references to poor service and customer care."}
{"text":"we've gone there a few times ever since, and the servers we got were rude. 
I asked the server if I could get a slice of cake or something cause it was my birthday and after I should him my ID and everything, he didn't bring it as promised and said he forgot. 
Other times, they'd run out of soup after I had asked to get it and I got nothing - not even salad."}
{"text":"I can say it all with three letters: .....Meh.

I took a date here because we'd planned on going to the Sunridge movie theater afterwards and neither of us drive, so this seemed like as good an option as any. Besides, a friend of mine always seems to enjoy it when she and her boyfriend go to another ESM's so I figured it must be good.

I don't even know how to explain my feelings when I first stepped in. I've never been to one of these restaurants and, judging by what I had heard, expecting something a little more low-key, and with a bit more class. What I was met with was a place packed with primarily older people and their kids in a rather tacky looking dining room, which was BUZZING with staff... but most were off in groups of two or three having their own conversations, rather than attending to the customers.

When I arrived and saw how full it was, noticing my date was running a tad late, I asked them if I could simply be put into the seating order and wait at the door, but they insisted on seating me right away. This made things rather awkward when I was sitting at a table by myself, with just a glass of water, as other people were being told there would be a wait to be seated. This didn't seem like the brightest idea. Neither did using a booth that could probably comfortably sit 5-6 people as a table for two... but hey, it's their business.

We ordered a platter of nachos as an appetizer and each of us ordered an 8 oz. New York Striploin steak, and were asked what soup/salad we wanted. Apparently both of us misunderstood and thought these would be small sidedish sized portions. Not so. The nachos were probably enough to feed 2 normal people for an entire meal, followed by (again meal sized) salads, to the point we were both practically full by the time the steaks arrived - so long story short, we finished nothing but the drinks.

This being said, most of the food WAS very good - I particularly enjoyed the 'Mario's potatoes' that came with the steak, but really the only thing I didn't care for was the dressing on the salad, which was quite bitter.

The service was bitter-sweet. I don't think we had one consistent server for any two consecutive visits to the table. One young lady took the appetizer order, another the main order, the food was brought by two different people and in order to get some assistance when the young man who took the salad dishes inadvertantly took both of our forks, we spent 5 minutes trying to get ANYONE'S attention, at which point the guy I assume was the manager (because he wasn't in the uniform the rest were wearing) had to come rushing over himself - meanwhile there were at least 2 groups of staff just hanging out and talking.

All in all I'd say I quite enjoyed the food - though the appetizers and salads really didn't need to be nearly so big - but the decor, planning and staff inconsistencies make it hard to give this place that glowing a review. Not a terrible spot if you're in the area and need a bite, but I most definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come back.

{"text":"I haven't been to an East Side's in a really long time. The last time I went it was horrible and I vowed to never go back again. But then I was invited to a surprise birthday party for my niece and it was being held at an East Side Mario's and of course I must attend. 

The decor is that of any East Side Mario's but then was pleasantly surprised with the service. Our waiter's name was Kyle and he was very cheerful and upbeat and a great waiter. Always filling our empty platter with more hot bread and filling our salads once they were finished.

The food came and I was blown away. It was really good compared to what I had remembered from previous visits. My boyfriend got the half chicken and it tasted superb! It almost rivaled Swiss Chalet's chicken...ALMOST! 

A big thumbs up to this particular location as with all franchises, they vary from location to location with the quality of food and service. Prices are great and good for families and children."}
{"text":"UberEATS order, half of order missing and we got sick from the food that did show up. Everything tasted bland and I'll never order from or go there again."}
{"text":"Went on Mother's Day and not sure if it was under staffed or not but waited 15 min for a table even though there was about 4 tables that were empty and needed to be cleared off. The wait for the food was extremely long. The food itself was not good in fact I get nauseous just thinking about it. I had the chicken linguinie pasta dish. The server was not adept at cleaning our table as we were finished certain dishes and we had our dessert with all of our dishes from dinner still piled up in the middle. We were told the bruschetta would be quite some time which makes no sense considering it's a starter. The whole experience was just very mediocre and I do not wish to go back there again. Additionally the music was obnoxiously loud and terrible at some times just sounding like someone was screaming at some points."}
{"text":"My kids use to live this place when it was closer to my home decided to go for old times sake, always loved the all you can eat salad and soup. Both simple but tasty, the other stuff I'd rate a 3, but when I got my plate the steamed veggies were raw. I brought to the waitresses attention and she took 25% off my meal which was fair. That's why the 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is always packed.  Waitress seems exhausted, there are few young girls at reception but not really helping much but take your name down for a table, my gf ask one of them about a promo and they need to go in ask one of the waitress. Why they need 3 girls in front anyway?! There are empty tables with stuff on it and no one go clean up it up for the whole 2 hours I was there. All you can eat pasta is misleading since they will add $2.99 topping charge for every other dishes of pasta you ordering."}
{"text":"I was here with my boyfriend over the weekend and I don't always have the best experiences with the food at ESM, but I thought I would give it another try.
We ordered, the AYCE Bread and Ceasar salad, Bruschetta, Chicken Parmigiano with fries, Pepperoni pizza, two cokes, an a mini chocolate mousse (thing).
The first thing out was the Bruschetta, and my GOD it was delicious.  I almost wish the meal had stopped there because that was the best part.  Nice and fresh, very tasty, and definitely enough to share (no more than three to share though, order two if you're a group of four or more).  The ceasar salad was okay.  Nothing remarkable.  Should have had more cheese and at least a lemon to cut the dressing a bit.  But, we barely ate the full bowl.  The garlic loaf that they offer was just, okay.  After the bruschetta, it wasn't anything to write home about.
The pop was a little...flat?  It didn't have enough fizz and was definitely too sugary.
The Pizza tasted like one of those pizza buns you can get from any grocery store. and it was kind of small, but fresh I guess.
The chicken parm was better than I've had at other ESM's, but too much sauce, not enough cheese, and honestly just lacking.  The fries, well, I could have made better fries at home.
The desert was nice, chocolatey, but small.  Definitely not enough to share between two people unless you're just craving a touch of chocolate.
We were seated at the bar (by choice) and at first we were getting good service, drinks were being refilled.  Then suddenly, our waitress was gone, turns out she went out for a smoke, and the person who \"took over\" for her, didn't even leave the bar area.  When she got back, we waited longer than we should have for her to check on us.  Getting more bread, refills, the bill etc.
Overall, I would go back for appetizers and booze before a game or before going to a sporting event, but not really interested in going for dinner again."}
{"text":"Bad service and food is below average. With the turnover they have you would at least expect professional waiters."}
{"text":"Went to east side Mario's for som decent Italian food. 
The service was good! The only reason we go there is for their Hell's Kitchen chicken! It is really good if you're into spicy food. When you order an entree your offered unlimited soup or salad and garlic bread. 
It's a mediocre Italian restaurant. Their prices are slightly high."}
{"text":"Okay... I know East Side Marios is just like every other chain, but I swear to you their Zucchini Frittes ARE. TO. DIE. FOR.  Literally...
My man and I were just sitting there and the waitress comes up and lets us know that its half priced apps. We don't go there too often so when I heard that my mind just went  \"DAMMMMMMNNNNNNN\" and my mind was instantly changed. I am forever grateful and blessed for choosing the zucchini because they are honestly mind blowing and worth it. The portion size was great too! Perfect for 2-3 people to share. 

But in all seriousness, you can never go wrong with all you can eat soup or salad! Plus, there pasta is pretty cheap too!"}
{"text":"Brutal Brutal delivery! Took 50 mins to place our order!  Love love the food but was totally brutal customer service! :)"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food is very mediocre. Barely passable at best. Had the chicken parmesan and pasta bolognese. Chicken parmesan was very bland and too soggy. The pasta was pure cheese and even then it tasted bland. Best part of the meal was the garlic loaf and Italian wedding soup. 

Definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Overall a satisfying meal and a enjoyable waiter, got the \"build your own pizza\" that was on sale so to speak for 11.99 got an extra topping on top the 2 free ones. 
Wasn't too loud and the staff was working fast. 
Ps it helps to get there before the usual meal times to avoid wait times."}
{"text":"Very disappointment in this dish. I decided to try something new and the picture of the dish caught my eye. However after ordering it and being served....it did not look anything like the picture and it was lacking in seasoning. The chicken breast was tiny and had very little Italian sausage. Altogether it lacked taste/seasoning and didn't not appeal to me after seeing it in person. Extremely disappointed and not satisfied with this dish what so ever. Will never order it again."}
{"text":"Wow!  What an evening. It is always an annual tradition to go out for dinner with my family the day before school starts. Our service started well with order taking and friendly service. It then went sideways. We had to finally ask for our drinks after 20 minutes. Then was told my soup new batch was being made and could I wait 5 minutes or want another. I said sure I can wait. Then my family didn't get there salad forever. Then my soup finally came and we never saw our waitress forever. She didn't ask for more soup or salad. Never checked in on us. She serviced 2 other tables who go their salad and bread and also sat down 30 minutes after us. We asked the front desk to help twice for help. Then we waited a long time for our meals and when it came my daughter's which was told as gluten free bow tie even though the same waitress said gluten free is only long. My chicken parm was like rubber and cold from sitting. I asked for a manager and they sent someone else instead. She said manager was too busy to see us. She said she would compensate some of the meal. Her and our waitress must have been inexperienced. Manager came but we wanted to eat so I said to review with what we told the girl told to see us because he was busy. Then bill came and no discount. Then the waitress was rude to my wife about bill and said what do you want is to comp the meal?  My wife said no but you tell us what you would do to make us come back. Very bizarre evening!  I have never experience such poor service. Nobody made us feel any better!  My wife and I don't complain that often. This time it fell on deaf ears. No effort from management. I guess they don't want us to come back. I hope the waitress learns from this experience and improves or does something else. We have been in this location before and have not had bad service. Never before have we ever had such disappointing and frustrating experience!  It has ruined our evening even after we left."}
{"text":"We went through a short dance about the hostess \"finding a table\". Since he had my mother in law with us, I took the liberty of pointing out the empty tables to the hostess. They were clearly visible although the restaurant was busy. Others were \"waiting for a table\", but I think that this is the M.O. here, to promote a kind of exclusivity.

The orders were taken after about 10 minutes, and the marathon wait started. First we waited a few minutes for the bread. Then  waited a few more minutes for the salad. And then the wait began, and went on and on.

I had ordered a make your own pasta with Fettuccine, Arrabiata Sauce and Shrimps. My wife ordered Salad and Wedding Soup. My mother in law ordered a baked concoction of pasta shells gummied up with a sauce of sorts.

We had to hail several of the wait staff as the marathon wait was going on. Things started coming after more than 45 minutes, not including the previous wait time. Soup came without a spoon. Salad was served put not parmesan offered, etc. It was a grind.

Once all the food had come, we were able to eat about 1:15 minutes after we had ordered. I have a feeling the ticket may have been lost but anything is possible.

The fettuccine was OK. At least it was al dente. I am guessing they made it in a hurry after our complaints. The baked \"goop\" was terrible. The salad was OK and the Wedding soup just a bit watery and tasteless. At that point, I decided to seek out the manager/franchise owner.

I found him \"checking the floor\" and invited him to the table. He immediately agreed to remove the baked dish from the tab and then went through the motions. No warmth, no genuine caring, no eye contact...all strong indicator that he was not serving quality but just slinging the bull.

If you have young kids who need to express themselves during a shopping expedition, you might want to go through the wringer here. Otherwise I can't imagine anybody making the effort.

I am convinced that the Owner does not care, and it shows."}
{"text":"Its a decent place, though I don't think I'll be coming back. The prices are too high for the quality of food you are getting. For my bow tie shrimp pasta, I paid about $18 for a messily little plate. My friend got the deep friend chicken, it was a gigantic portion, but nothing special, just a large piece of chicken friend, with cheese on top, sitting on a bed of pasta. Mediocre food, will try my luck somewhere else for edible food."}
{"text":"HELLO ... I can't hear you!  It is so loud in this restaurant you can not hear the person sitting across from you.   Returned pasta three times because it was cold.  Seriously?  No one checked before sending it out numerous times.  Mediocre bad Italian food."}
{"text":"I'll never take my family here again.  The service was very slow, even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  While the server wasn't \"unpleasant\", she was less than thrilled to wait our table, and was almost dropping our plates on the table.  The food was marginal at best - my son's 4 cheese pizza was so greasy, he barely ate half of it.  My other son's linguine alfredo had almost no flavour and was basically bland white sauce on pasta.  My seafood linguine was cooked nicely, but the sauce tasted like Ragu out of a jar.  The best part of the meal was the bread, salad and italian wedding soup.  When it came time to pay, it seemed to take forever for our server to process our bill, and with her attitude afterwards, I could see she was less than impressed with her 10% tip, which she was lucky to get considering both my kids told me not to leave her one at all."}
{"text":"This is an Olive Garden copy but not as good.

The decor is that of the Italian district in New York.

The food is your typical Italian flare but overall not that great.

If you want great Italian food, go to College St."}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of East Side Mario's before.  The food here was the same, but service not the greatest.  I went because of location.  It was a convenient place to sit down for a quick bite.

Service was slow.  I think they may have only had one server...?  Weird, but I didn't see anyone else and it was a busy lunch time.  I opted to pay the extra $4 for all you can eat salad.  After I finished my first bowl I had to wait for quite a long time before she came back to bring me more.  Then when she finally came back she asked \"do you want any more salad?\"  I held back from sarcasm, maybe other customers pay extra for all you can eat and then don't eat any more...anyways, got my second bowl at the same time as my main dish.

Next time I will walk a bit farther to avoid this spot.  It was ok, but that's all I would give it."}
{"text":"I had this scallop cream sauce pasta dish that was amazing!  A few bacon wrapped scallops on top too, how can you possibly go wrong with that?

On the other hand, my salad tasted like something I'd get from a fast food cafeteria.  This is disappointing because one thing I always look forward to here and at Olive Garden are those awesome salads!

Service was good, I'd go back, pretty much what you'd expect from ESM.

One side note that they don't take Amex here..."}
{"text":"We came in, waited over an hour at the table no bread, no food. We did get salad. Must have been 80 degrees in there manager claims one hour earlier it was freezing. Lady at the table next to us told us she'd been there for an hour and that wasn't true. Finally requested food to go (toddler antsy after waiting so long, plus it was after 8p) and the waitress asked how everything was going. My response, horrible. Her, I know. 

75 minutes in and finally part of our to go offer is here. 

Anyways, the manager finally expedited our food to go and took 50% off the bill, but as we finish our dinner in a hotel room can't say I'd recommend the experience"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend on a Monday night. The service was horrible. Took our waitress 20 mins to even greet us, drop bread at our table for her to run away for another 10 mins. When she got back, she took our orders. It took her another 15 mins for her to bring my beverage to the point where I had to think she forgot. We waited another half hour for the food. And I had to stop her while she was running around frantically serving only 4 other tables to ask her not to put any cheese on my dinner as I'm allergic, she ran away saying 'ya okay.' When the meals came, there was no sauce on my pasta. And we waited for another 10 mins for her to pass by our table to ask about the sauce and to refill my friends drink and to bring us more salad. And to get that took another 20 mins. It took that long to get a little sauce, pop and salad. And the place wasn't busy. And she asked me if I wanted cheese on my dinner, after I told her about my allergy and my food being cold for waiting on sauce. The other patrons being served by our waitress looked angry. One of them who has seniors at the table talked to a manager since they waited 30 mins to get their bill and all the manager did was shake her head and walked away! Wow! Just as we were leaving, another family was talking about how the same waitress didn't come to greet them for 20 mins, despite her passing the table. 
I will never come to this location again. The one star rating is only for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen,

I used to remember being hyped up on going to East Side Mario's as a treat with my parents, get some yummy pasta and infinite bread and salad to go with it. Yeah sure u still get the all u can eat bread and salad with your meal, but meh.

Last few times I've gone the service was crazy slow when it wasn't even busy, in the warmer months there was a bunnnch of fruit flies around , and they gross me out , and that's not cool dude. Prices are okayyyyyish but heck, last time I went and got the baked penne Alfredo it came out cold and with verry little sauce, the cheese on top had literally chilled back to a non melty state, like comonnnn there seems to be less and less locations of ESM to go to, there must be a reason.... Don't blame Boston Pizza for taking your market share, step up your game cuz its only downhill from here as I seez it. Meh, don't bother going here. I'm finished with it now."}
{"text":"The primary reason to go to ESM is for the outstanding server Scott M. I have eaten in a lot of high end restaurants and have not found a more customer-focussed server. If Scott worked at Ruth Chris' or similar, he would be raking in the tips!

The food was pretty 'meh', but without Scott fixing the kitchen's shortcomings, one star would have been in order.  

The garden salad was fine, but Scott kicked it up a notch by bringing me a side of balsamic dressing.  What a great addition! 

I ordered the DIY pasta, a linguine with bolognese sauce and meatballs. It arrived with virtually no sauce. Without any prompting, Scott brought an extra bowl of sauce. The pasta was lukewarm, but the piping hot side of sauce helped immensely. 

The funnel cake was a grease sponge, with a small scoop of ice cream and a small cup of canned whipped cream.  Nothing memorable except my mild upset stomach. 

Food wise, Levetto is head and shoulders above, with some amazing deserts. Now if Scott would just work there, it would be perfect!  Scott, let me know where you work next-I have a lot of fellow Elites that would appreciate your level of service!"}
{"text":"Great female server.  Smiled at us a lot.  Liked that.  Made us felt welcome.  Food on the other hand was so-so.  Perhaps it was what we ordered.  Might go again in the future and try something else.  Might."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times and although I used to quite enjoy ESM I find this location may have opened prematurely. Actually I was very surprised to come tonight to see that no draft beer was available after the extended drought of no liquor licenses.

Hoping they figure things out before the reputation kills any returning business."}
{"text":"Sunday evening, me and some coworkers went for dinner at East Side Mario's. We entered and were greeted by the hostess and who seemed unenthused and not very friendly. I asked if we could have a table of 5 and she said in a few minutes or we could take the empty table that everyone was avoiding as it's right by the door where the draft from customers walking in out was a target. In -11 weather...no thanks. We decided to wait.

It took about 10 min to seat a party of 5 even though were about 3-4 tables that needed to be cleared in sight. Finally seated, our server came by and introduced himself. My manager wanted to clarify that it was a work event and just needed to let him know of the pay arrangements in advance so that he wasnt' bombarded. He responded apprehensive as if the request was out-to-lunch. \"Uh...I dunno. I mean, I can ask but I 'm not sure so I dunno.\" He didnt' seem interested in trying to cater at all.

Our drinks arrived in a timely manner but me and my manager both ordered 8 oz glasses of wine. So, why were our glasses not even? Hers looked like a 6 oz and mine a 8oz. I asked why they are uneven for the same oz size. He just replied \"Uh maybe the waiter who poured it in the back spilled some.\" ??? He then made no attempt to try to rectify it and my manager didn't want to make a big deal so we let it go.

We never got our food until about 45 min after we  recieved our drinks. The same waiter mentioned something about a problem with it being punched in. We weren't offered any perks to make up for the mistake either. After our meals came out, a new waitress came and said that our old waiter got stressed out and decided to go home. Couldn't have been from OUR table because we didn't say anything bad to him or confusing at all. When it was time to get our bills, they screwed up everyone's orders and we ended up just writing it down for them to straighten it out as drinks and meals were scattered randomly on different bills. 

The food was ok, I orded Baked Penne Bolognese. The price wasn't bad either. It was under the all you can eat salad/soup with garlic bread for $12.99. The wine was good too but the customer service was kinda crappy."}
{"text":"Food is good by the way but that isn't why I am only giving them 2 stars. I go there to place an order for takeout and I am told that it would be 20 minutes. So I wait...and wait...20, 25, 30 minutes before my order is ready. EXCEPT, my bread isn't ready. So my food is on the counter getting cold, the server tells me that it would be 2 minutes and so, I wait...and wait another 5, 10, 15 minutes after she just walks off and doesn't show up again. The nice chef dude asks me what I am waiting for and sees to it that I get my bread and I am off to go home. Letting me know what's going on would have kept my anger at bay. Chicken Parmigiana is really as big as your head and one of the best I've had. Food is excellent, gotta work on the service tho."}
{"text":"This place has been on a steady up for the last 4 years. 
They've improved their service so much! We had Jeff as our server and he was fantastic. Always making sure we had everything we needed and even things we didn't need yet, he was on top of everything. 

I would have to say give east side another try if you've given up on them. 

They give a discount for CAA members and you now get Scene points too!"}
{"text":"A passable faux-Italian restaurant in the same range as The Olive Garden, but Olive Garden does it better. It's not bad for a quick lunch when you're craving Italian food, but isn't \"authentic\" so set your expectations accordingly."}
{"text":"Not bad Italian food for a chain. The chicken dishes seem as though they used some sort of processed chicken breast which isn't preferred in a restaurant of quality, so I'd avoid. But the pasta dishes are reasonably good."}
{"text":"East side marios is a pretty tasty chain.
This was our first time at this location, to which we went to because we were seeing a movie right after our dinner.

When we got to the restaurant we were told, 15-20 minute wait. After 35 minutes of waiting we FINALLY got seated.
With a time crunch of just over 2 hours until our movie, we wanted to eat quickly and get going. Once we told our server that we had a movie to catch, she turned into the road runner!
She was awesome, very quick, friendly and efficient.
We each got the $15 special that was going on during the month of march. 
I personally love this deal because for $15 you get ALOT!

Salad,bread and then your hefty pasta meal. YUM. 
We took the rest to go because it was sooooo filling.

We finished up our meal just over an hour and had plenty of time to make our movie.

This is the kind of service i'd hope most restaurants should be doing which unfortunately is rare.

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Surprised I have not reviewed East Side yet.  We usually come here once in a while as it is a great family atmosphere.  kid friendly, good prices, and all you can eat salad and bread are soo good.  Portions are pretty big.   The chicken parm is probably the best I have tried anywhere.  The lasagna is a favorite as well.  Service has always been great.  Went there last Friday. Had the capelletti and the lasagna, it was very good.  Kids meal pizza was good as well.  Plenty of choices on the kids menu."}
{"text":"Typical New York style Italian fare in a village style setting. The food is acceptable and affordable. Be careful though, the unlimited salad and bread can fill you up."}
{"text":"We always know what to expect here. The menu has changed in my 2 year absence but that's a good thing.
The waitress is an airhead...so far she failed to bring the right drinks and didn't offer my kid a drink...the nite is still young..."}
{"text":"I love east sides and always have. In love with botht he ceasar salads and Italian wedding soup. I always order the chicken amatrianni (or however you spell it). Our server today was on point. We sat on the patio on one of the hottest days on the summer and so the patio only had a couple sitting, while inside there was a 30 minute wait. We opted for the patio and service and server was superb and quick. Didn't have my CAA card to get 10% off but didn't care after the quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"After our first order we had high hopes... but unfortunately I have to agree with the other 1 star reviews. Their service and their food quality is quite lacking. After waiting an hour and 50 minutes we cancelled the pizza order because it still wasn't here (Almost 2hrs for 2 pizzas? Ridiculous)... The chicken tetrazzini that we received on our last order had literally no chicken. This place is not reliable, food quality seems to be very random and their customer service is equally horrible. I will no longer be ordering from East Side Mario's, as we gave them 3 opportunities to prove that it was just a momentary issue/fluke, but it seems to be a consistent issue."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before . The Last 2 times i sat in the Bar . The bartender is really nice , young lady short brown hair .very sweet and courteous . 
Today one person in our group, had a disappointment with there food not being cooked well ....The Manager did a great job taking care of the situation and made everything right . It's nice to have good people working to make sure your service is right . I give the manager 2 thumbs up at her caring attitude, and 2 thumbs up for the bartender and our server aswell, all in all great experience. Food is good ....decent prices on the menu  . Best to sit in the bar if you can . Aswell they have good drink specials ."}
{"text":"Terrible service, oily tasteless food, noisy restaurant. East Side Mario's used to be a fun place for a family dinner. Not anymore. The last time I was there, I couldn't finish my pasta because it was so oily --- and the portions weren't very big, either. Even the \"endless\" bread was smaller than it used to be.

After sitting there disgusted by the food, we had to flag down the wait-staff for my bill because our server had disappeared. We tossed cash on the table and fled. Blegh. Won't go back."}
{"text":"If you like waiting for a table, this place is for you. We waited one hour and twenty-five minutes before my wife spoke the manager (male manager).  They finally sat us in the bar, why didn't they give us a table in the dinning room is baffling to me. It was a little late to say anything to them since they had sat an other family that arrived after us in the dinning room. The waitress came by and skipped my wife completely.  Was it because she spoke to the manager?  We don't know! Then when the waitress came back my wife told he what I don't get anything to drink?  The waitress then went back and started pointing out my wife by pointing at her saying she's a......  this upset my wife, she then approached the female manager but all she could say was I'm going to call the police. Then the male manager came back out and spoke with my wife and she explained the waitresses behavior. He said he'd take care of it. We got an other waitress. At this point my wife and I weren't hungry so the kids ate and we didn't. Our final bill was $24.00. Great night out! NOT! Do not come to this place if your having a great day. 

However we still all left not hungry!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Eastside Mario's for my birthday dinner, my pasta arrived luke warm and my husband's thin crust pizza was stone cold. He tried warming it in the oven which ended up just drying it out. He said the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza. Overall very disappointing. When I've eaten in the restaurant it's generally pretty good. If they're going to offer delivery they need to find a way to keep the food hot."}
{"text":"One word. Disaster. That's it. Never again. We've tried it a few times. Each time is a disaster. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Been here on a few occasions. I don't really know why we keep going back. I think I forget about the bad/cold food, cheeseless pizzas, terrible service and dirty dishes. We visited again a few weeks ago and the waiter took our order, delivered our food and we never heard from him again. The pasta was cold, there was no cheese on my pizza and there was stuff floating in our dirty beer glasses. We complained and our waiter immediately got the manager who apologized and blaimed it on the supervisor who understaffed them. She was quick to remove one of the dishes from our bill which was nice but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Do not ever order the steak - it was flat, overlooked and came on a hamburger bun. We didn't get the wings we ordered as an appetizer, they forgot to get our son's beverage ---- and we had arranged for them to bring dessert and sing happy birthday, which never happened. We are NEVER GOING BACK. Don't waste your time or money. Eat at the dumpster out back, it would be a better dining experience. (Wish I could give negative stars!)"}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant for years now and they never disappoint. The food is delicious and the service is amazing. Also, the free garlic bread is just so good, my family and I can never get enough. Definitely recommend as a family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My husband took me there for my surprise bday with our kids and we all had a great time. Absolutely recommend this restaurant. Thank you Eastside Marios"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: I haven't been back in a while (year or so) and they've definitely did up some nice renovations. The place is much cleaner and spacious, and open concept where you can see the chefs preparing your food. 

Food: 
1. Chicken parmigiana : 3/5, nothing really stood out, pretty standard. The chicken was served over spaghetti. I found the portion to have changed significantly smaller but for the same expensive price. 
2. Chicken linguini: 2.5/5 , quite bland, nothing special at all. Seems a bit watery. Again, small portion for 17.00

Overall: we made reservations before coming, which was a super smart move, because the waits was about 30 mins, on a Saturday night. I got a few of  the coupons for east sides, which is why we'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Had a great satisfying dinner after flying in from San Francisco.

Service was excellent. We had spaghetti and meat balls and veal parmigiana. Came with all you eat wedding soup and caesar's salad.

Carly was our awesome server."}
{"text":"Since I had a great experience at East side mario's in Guelph, I decided to try here as well.
I came here with my daughter. Sunday afternoon, around 4pm we arrived and spent about 10 mins at the door, The Restaurant didn't seem busy but I figured maybe we came after the storm. I didn't mind the wait. Once we got to our table, it took more than 10 mins for our server to come our table. I told 'T' that I would like to enjoy our appetizer and salad and have the main course after our appetizers.
it took another 10 mins for drinks and actually the hostess gave us our drinks.
We got our salads served by another hostess or busgirl. it took a while to get our salads but I thought the reason the salad came late because I said to her I want to eat slowly and spend time my daughter...
Well... I was very wrong, my server was busy with other tables somewhere else and she just order to the kitchen and leave it up to hostess and busgirl.
While I was having salad-just starting to eat, they rush to drop Budda boomer bread with sauce in tiny black cup-it was different from the other east side Mario's, and our main course at the same time.
By the time we finish our salad, and bread and pasta was cold and still never saw our waitress 'T'. I was too upset to finish anyway.
'T' came to our table for the first time after she took our order and asked me if we want some cheese.
We received pasta like 15 mins ago... I think it's pretty late to ask about cheese.
I told her i want take out box, then again she disappeared.
After we waited for a while I asked busgirl for bill and take out box. after we received our bill, this time 'T' came TWICE  to close our bill. 
It was very poor service, food wasn't bad but it was bad service. bad enough that I don't want to come back again.
If she was too busy to look after 2 people on the table,.
she should give our table to another server or at least make note to kitchen that don't give everything at once. or ask busgirl or hostess for better help.
I saw big sign on the wall that 'Under new management or new owner' 
Well good luck."}
{"text":"What a joke!

Came here for lunch on a Thursday.  Place was 2/3 full with other convention ppl.  We were seated promptly and ordered quick.  Took 40 minutes for a panini and ravioli.  Waitress kept telling us the food was coming.  THen she said it was coming out of the over.... whatver.  when are food finally hit the table, we asked her to bring us the check cause we're in a hurry.  Nope.  we finished our food and waited an addtional 10 min for the check.  The 1hr and 15 minutes we were there, we spent 50 minutes just waiting.

Outrageous.  The hot dog/burger cart outside the convetion center tasted better and cheaper!!!

$0 tip."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner. We were seated very quickly at the bar area. The waitress also gave us a loaf of warm bread. We ordered 4 items and they also came to the table quite fast as well. 

Our order were:

1. Calamari Al Diavolo (Signature)
On the menu it said it was a signature dish, so we decided to try it out. The description in the menu said \"a light seasoned calamari with garlic, onions, red, green & red hot cherry bomb pepper in a tomato broth on a sizzling plate\". The presentation was nice, but the taste was so so. I like the spice level of all the peppers especially the cherry bomb. But the calamari was a bit overcooked and some pieces were burnt to the sizzling plate. Also there wasn't a tomato broth underneath. 

2. Garden Salad 
The salad was ok. There was also pickled hot peppers in the salad which was a nice touch. 

3. Mario's 16 Layer Lasagna (Signature)
 For a signature dish the presentation was disappointing. I was really expecting a 16 layer lasagna, but it was not. It was tasty because of the cheese but definitely not worth $19.49.

4. New York Chesecake (with strawberry coulis)
My husband was raving how good this cheesecake was, so he forced me to try it, even though I was extremely full. It was not bad but nothing special.

Our waitress on the other hand was very friendly, kept smiling the whole time."}
{"text":"for starters when i was seated i had to wait for 10 minutes for a server to even come to my table and when i ordered some garden salad they had brought me TOMATO SOUP instead and the server who was clearly an experienced waiter was quite confused  and when i ordered a pasta it took them 20 minutes for them to bring me my pasta and i had ordered a pasta with meatballs and tomato sauce and did i get it NO they gave me bologines in most places bologines is meat sauce but here it's some sort of  Lasagne like sauce and when i told the server he got mad at me and when i ordered bread  i never got it until i asked the server were my bread was and also it was quite loud in there and when i got the bread it was burnt and a few seconds in i noticed a group of flies on my pasta out of all the east side marios i've been to this has to be the worst of them all."}
{"text":"As with most chain restaurants each location is similar but can be slightly different, this location however everything either goes very well or a complete disaster!

For some reason the waitresses here seem to be lost, nothing against them but the waiters are much better. 

The reason I started to frequent this location more was for a server who no longer works here named Jason, but I have also recently discovered Josh and Taylor who are also as great if not better!

As for the food, alot of times you have to wait for fresh bread to be made, which honestly maybe that isn't a bad thing because then you end up with hot bread and hopefully not overeat all those carbs!

I like to get the pizza, it has a nice thin crust and I usually have some leftover for lunch the following day so it makes two meals for me and it is very reasonably priced as well.

Don't forget to use your CAA card for 10% off and your scene card for points!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and were welcomed with excellent service. The bartender/server was friendly and tvs had sports galore on. Unlimited bread and salad was great and food was on point. Coming back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"If there was a minus five that's what I would give after my recent trip. I am not going to lie..... I don't love this place. I have never had a meal that was even a smidgen better than fine. There is a spicy calamari appetizer that is ok and that's the best that it gets. I am not usually this hard on any place but when I feel concerned for the safety of me and my family I say it's go time. 

We went early, as we usually do since waiting in line with a 4 year old can be painful for anyone around us. We were seated by a pleasant young lady and given menus and crayons so were all happy. Our server came quickly to take our drink orders and they also came quickly.  Choosing our meals was easy so when our drink arrived we ordered and waited for our soup. When it arrived it was warm and tasted fine and the bread was fresh and the MARGARINE was there. Seriously though..... Margarine? Gross.

So right about now you must  be thinking that I am crazy to want to give this place a -5. Just wait...... 

Our meal arrived the same way it usually does (and one of the reasons I don't generally like this place) about 4 minutes after the soup and salad arrived. There is never enough room for everything on the table and if you aren't done your  \"all you can eat soup\" you get a \"so cold you can hardly eat\" entree. I suspect it is to keep you from actually eating all you can eat soup or salad.  

Around this time my 4 year old stood up and announced to everyone within about 500 metres that she had to pee.... Nothing new here. She and I made our way to the ladies washroom and selected the big stall so we could both go. I went first and as I was finishing up (sorry for TMI but it's important to the story) my daughter  said \"Momma what is this?\" As she reached for something. Know what it was??? A USED NEEDLE HANGING OUT OF THE FEMININE PRODUCT DISPOSAL FLAP IN THE STALL!!!!!! A USED NEEDLE!!!!!! (And yes I know for sure that's what it was). We finished and washed and left. 

We returned to the table, had our left overs packed and GTFO. I know that I should have said something but I was so angry I just left. I will acknowledge that there are may reasons that people need to give themselves injections.... And with all due respect I am extremely tolerant (including some diabetic friends that appropriately medicate at my house) but this was so far beyond safe and acceptable that I can't imagine ever returning. 

There are so many what ifs.... What if she had grabbed it and gotten pricked? What if I had? What if someone else had? Need I go on? When we left and I told my husband about the situation he asked why I didn't tell anyone, and I should have. I was so upset and concerned for my family that I didn't think of others. I feel sick about about that but need to say that I took a huge wad of TP and shoved it into the flap so it wasn't hanging out. But I should have done more.

Food wise this was one of the better meals I have had. But I don't know if there is anything that could convince me it try again. Or if anyone one there would make an effort to ensure that we do."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. What I thought was a has been years ago has now been a very consistent experience (been here 4-5 times in the last 6 months).

Service is excellent and menu is good size with great specials on pizzas, pasta and drinks. 

Decor inside is similar to all East Side Mario's with faux wall paper of Americana and Italian culture. 

There is a bar side for 18+ with lots of TVs. On dining side lots of booths (my fav). 

Pricing and food is great and meals can cost between $16-20 per person with a good kids menu too. 

Scene points can be collected here and Apple Pay!

Great value for Italian food for SE/SW Calgarians and can't go wrong selecting East Side for any occasion."}
{"text":"I can only vouch for their take out service cause I've never actually dined at this place but the take out service is alright. I ordered online and was hoping to pick it up right away and leave as I was in a hurry. When I got there no one was there in the take out room to help us out. Another 2 customers had come behind me and still there was no one to help us get our orders. I had yelled \"excuse me\" probably 10 times and waited 15 minutes before someone came in to help us. Once she was there I got my Food quickly. The take out area itself was dirty and disorganized. The price of the food is extremely ridiculous but I guess it's alright for the taste of the food. I ordered the mini pizza and mini pasta that's for kids cause it was cheap lol. It was 6.99 and comes with a drink, toy, and brownie. The pizza tasted good but the pasta could have been better. The pasta sauce was good but the spaghetti noodle was stale. Overall, I really hope the dining experience is much better than the take out experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on March break. It was packed because kids ate free, so it was pretty busy.
40 minute wait. 
When we were seated, there were at least 5 empty tables. I don't know how long we were waiting for no reason.

Since the restaurant wasn't very busy now, our service was decent.
Unlimited salad was decent. Had to ask a few times to get salads though. Ate way too much bread while waiting.

Entrees were reheated frozen food. Was not that good, but I have had worse. For the price, it was acceptable.

Probably won't come back unless bringing the kids for the free food."}
{"text":"We were here on July 4, 2015 for an early birthday celebration. Upon arrival the hostess was no where to be found, off doing other things I presume, after waiting for several minutes we final were seated. We were seating in a booth (by choice) which was quite small. It was a squishy fit for 2 people. After again waiting for 10 minutes our server came over and took our drink order and food order. 

I ordered a pasta dish, and my boyfriend ordered a make your own pizza dish. Both were quite yummy. 

We asked for more bread and took quite awhile to get more. 

Aside from the slow service (and it wasn't a busy night) and small booths the celebration was great. Would hope for better service next time, but we are starting to think that Oakville has poor service everywhere. The price was great (can't beat all you can eat salad or soup and bread as an appy)."}
{"text":"Where to start, where to start... the food was good I had the hell's kitchen chicken and the tomato soup today... perfectly seasoned and cooked and the spices were perfect!!! well done kitchen staff!! 5 stars for you guys only!! but like always you never dissapoint at this chapter!!!    the bad part is well the service. we got in a few minutes before 4 and the place was not busy at all! only the small dinning room area by the kitchen had people eating about 4 other tables!  not once were we asked if we wanted our drinks reffilled or if we needed more bread etc!!! from there we waited an additional 3o minutes just to be given our bills after we were done and I was getting annoyed and on the edge of getting up to pay to whoever just so i could go shopping with a full tummy!! 4 out of 5 stars for the fact that the food and the s'moree pizza dessert were pure heaven!!! will sure be back no if no maybe but i will avoid this server!!"}
{"text":"Kind of lazy at this location. Ordered a Cesar and there was no spice on the glass rim and no celery. The waiter was great though. Food is crap as usual. This is not Italian by any means. Might as well go get bottled sauce at the grocery store."}
{"text":"This East Side Mario's fails to deliver and every time I eat here, I am always hungry. To start off, the food is dry. The food tastes like it was cooked in huge portions before service and warmed up when needed in dinner service. The portion sizes are very small and they really over price items on the menu. The service is friendly and helpful. The restaurant decor is nice. I would recommend this to anyone who is hanging out with friends who is looking for dinner to eat."}
{"text":"One of my fav go-to resturants! 
Great prices and portions and steps away from silvercity and many different stores. Fast service too (especially if you let them know you have a movie to catch in advance) and good drinks"}
{"text":"The name makes me think of a mob enforcer who is a lovable plumber on the side. But the experience made me retch just a little bit. I'm going to put the blame on the girlfriend's sister for choosing this travesty of an Italian restaurant. I'll chalk it up to a rookie mistake on her part because I'm pretty sure she doesn't eat except for show. 

Service: the waiter was a young guy (university age) who had the attention span and wherewithal of a prepubescent child with ADHD. The entire time we were there, he would ask something and proceed to walk off before we could answer. Literally, the conversations went like this:

[Waiter]: (while walking away) You guys doing okay? You need anything?
[Good looking Indian Patrons]: Yeah, do you... (waiter disappears)

(10 minutes later)

[Waiter]: How is everything? 
[Good looking Indian Patrons]: It's okay, but can... (waiter beats previously established speed walking record)

I just wanted some damn crushed red peppers! Service continued to be sporadic and limited to 10 seconds. After he dropped off the check, we didn't even see him the rest of the time we were there. 

Food: pbbbt. If I don't say anything more than that, does that make me a terrible Yelper? The girlfriend and I decided to split a pizza. The goat cheese and grilled chicken pizza description says that it's brushed with herbed olive oil; I want to know what kind of giant ass brush from Home Depot they're using. The pizza was practically floating in oil. We both proceeded to walk around like wretched zombies the rest of the day because we were so queasy from the food. This place makes Olive Garden seem classy in terms of food, restaurant appearance, and general demeanor of the staff. The sister got soup. Wooh. Her boyfriend got salad. Wooh again. Not much more to say about that. The girlfriend says that the place is generally average but she's never had a bad experience like that before so it might have been an off day. Therefore, I threw in an extra star, but I don't plan to ever come back. Not when Toronto/Mississauga has so much more to offer as far as culinary delights go."}
{"text":"As someone who has worked in the pantry at East sides I can say it's one of the few places I've worked at that I'll still eat at. The cheese cappeletti is to die for every time. If you love cheese x3 get this. 
Unlimited garden salad and bread makes the slightly slow service much more tolerable."}
{"text":"We used to frequent esm for dinner all the time as it used to be my kids' favourite restaurant. However there have been some changes that will probably prevent us from coming back as often. The restaurant and menu have been updated (nicely) and it looks like it is under new management, but they switched out the entire staff. We miss the old staff.  We were here last night (wednesday) so the restaurant was not dead, but was not extremely busy either. The service started out great, the server quickly came over with a loaf of garlic bread and butter, and quickly took our order. However the pizza we ordered along with our dinner entrees and our kids' entrees came WAY after we had already finished dinner. We ended up just sitting there an additional 15-20 minutes just waiting on a small pepperoni pizza. Had the server admitted she forgot to put the order in, as opposed to blaming the kitchen staff, we may have been a little more forgiving. Nevertheless, the pizza ended up being free of charge and was put in a takeout box for us to take home. And then...as part of their kids meal, the kids were entitled to a dessert. they both ordered the brownie with ice cream and whip cream, except it never came, even though we were just told 'the brownies have just come out of the oven, I'll be over with them shortly'. The server brought them ice cream sundaes instead. No explanation??... Anyway, food is still delicious, our favorites are the lasagna and the sausage and peppers penne.
We may be back, after a long while, hopefully the staff will be a little better trained."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we were told about a 15 minute delay, however we see many empty tables (some still dirty). At this point I should have left (guess I never learn)!

The service at this restaurant sucks so much. The waiter was negligent and messed up a lot, with no apologies. Food is just meh. For the price there are so many other options. 

I will avoid this place like the plauegeb"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but when I'm craving some \"Italian\" comfort food, this is my place. To be fair, this started when I was little when my parents would take me here as a reward for a good report card, doing well in my swimming lessons, etc, but my affinity for their cheese capaletti has withstood the test of time. Creamy cheesy goodness. Yum."}
{"text":"I love love love East Side Mario's except for this location. I am a repeat customer primarily because of the it's proximity to my house. But never have I once had good experience with the food. Usually it's sub-par, but last time I went (a week ago), the pasta was just nasty; watery and the cheese tasted weird. I couldn't get past two bites of my meal. The positives?

1. The AYCE Caesar Salad and Garlic Bread is sooooooooooo GOOD.

2. The waitress was a gem. I asked them to take my pasta away because of how bad it was and they didn't charge me for it. Last time that happened at this location (with the 7 cheese dip), I paid anyway. Not that I mind. But a gesture like that is appreciated. Because I literally DID NOT touch my food. 

Will I go back? Sadly, probably. It's just so convenient for me to frequent a visit. The Downtown one on Front St is probably the best one, hands down!"}
{"text":"I'm glad there is an East Side Mario's close to home. They are now able to serve alcohol. Servers are very positive and show they enjoy serving their customers which makes for a friendly atmosphere. Food and taste quality is consistent with other East Sides. Arguably, better than other locations. So far, so good with this location. Very pleased."}
{"text":"I can safely say that I will not be going back ever again. Everything was really watered down - from the sangria to the soup to the pasta. Just.. disappointment."}
{"text":"I came tonight for dinner.  The food standard remains the same: lot of cheese, thick sauce with intense flavour and over cooked pasta.   Frankly, I quite enjoyed the intense flavour.  

The place was busy for a Wednesday evening, yet the services was still efficient.  Empty plates were quickly removed.

Last but not least, there was bottomless salad and garlic bread.  For comfort food, what not to like?"}
{"text":"Relaxed and casual on this weekday lunch hour. Had the seafood linguine and the sauce was perfect; didn't over power the delicate seafood flavours. Service was attentive but not hovering. I will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best meal at a chain/Family type restaurant in ages! Service was fantastic in spite of the crowds. As a single diner, I was treated respectfully. Ford was wonderful and I almost finished it all. Thanks to Crystal, my server & the rest of the Group. Had the build your own pasta. Meatballs were mediocre by Mario's sauce & bow tie pasta was perfect. Caesar Salad was crop and fresh; a delight. Will be here again soon!! Real soon !!"}
{"text":"Vowed to never go to an East Side's ever again and I should have stuck with it. Do I even really need to review this restaurant? The rest of the reviews speak for themselves.

I pretty much only consider this place when I'm absolutely starved, because even if the food isn't great at least you can fill up on free salad and bread. NOT THIS TIME. 

We ordered two pasta entrees that are supposed to be accompanied with all-you-can-eat bread and salad. We got thee tiniest bowl of salad and no bread. Ever. I asked the waitress (Jackie) 3 times for our bread. If they simply were out of bread at the moment that would have been fine, but say that, don't leave me in this breadless-wonderment when I see plenty of other waitresses coming out with bread... why are you LYING TO ME?

Our pastas arrived by two large, saggy pant, rap battle looking guys, who the hell are you? And hey-bada-boom-bada-bing, HAIR. Nestled deep in my friends fettuccine. The worst part was he had to eat most of the surrounding dish before he found the surprise inside... like a Kinder Egg. I had a clear view of the kitchen from where I was sitting and I see no cooks in there with long, dark hair. Who planted that? Jackie? 

This place is UNDER STAFFED. Half the restaurant is empty but expect to wait for 30 minutes. Typical chain restaurant, no authenticity, small portion sizes, everything tastes flash fried or microwaved. You know the drill. 

This is Déjà vu? I posted a review for the East Side's on Dundas in Mississauga when I went for OPENING NIGHT and also found a hair in my pasta. What is with this place and lack of hygiene? They have the nerve to leave a \"Tell Us How We Did Today :D\" survey. Oh, I will.

This time I will NOT be coming back again. NOT NOT NOT."}
{"text":"What do you expect, it's called fast food, not good food. The salads and bread are good, but, I could make this myself. The pre portioned entrees are dissatisfying to say the least."}
{"text":"Had very bad experience here. Waiter was rude and order was very slow .He told me he has to charge me extra because I tried some of my husband 's salad ! Really? !Two Tables beside us shared their salad too just right beside us also ordered pasta ! This is our first time here and will NEVER come back!!!"}
{"text":"After coming here for a lunch gathering. My opinion of this place is neutral. They take reservation which is great for big parties. The restaurant seemed cleaned but was lifeless, may not matter to some, but something about hearing good music, good shows and wall decor does lighten up the mood of others. This place was very plain.

The servers were quick with the drinks and orders were taken rather quickly. The lunch food choices was not very good. I would rate it below average. Their menu lacked pictures and creative names. One thing that is positive is the garlic bread before being serve. I love garlic bread!

For food, I got my Philly cheesesteak sandwich with fries. It was a good size, but it not stand out from other Philly cheesesteak that I can get from fast food chains. No special sauce that may have added an extra kick for me to comeback. The fries were not crispy, but the ketchup made it tolerable. 

Unless, you are a pasta lover, I would not recommend to get anything else in the menu. The flavor and/or the presentation was poor and probably the only reason I won't recommend anyone to eat here. However, if another party is hosted here there won't be nothing wrong with that either since the food is tolerable."}
{"text":"Sitting at ESM eating and watched a guy make a complaint about the wait staff and the floor manager walked away from him shaking her head?  That's enough for me to post something! The waitress took 20mins just to say Hi! Took for ever to fill my pop! Didn't ask if we wanted dessert? Guess I didn't wanna order a funnel cake! Never again!"}
{"text":"This was the first time to go to this location .. Service was very slow and cleanliness was not great .. I tried their specialty dish \"chicken tatzani or something which i totally loved the first time i had but this time was realllllyyyyy Not good !! I love garlic , extra garlic but this pasta was just super extra garlic tasting!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I've outgrown the allure of East Side Mario's -- back in my retail days, my friend would meet me here (at the same Heartland location) for calamari and beer on Friday nights -- or I've been eating much tastier (and authentic) Italian food at other restaurants, but I was extremely disappointed with the selection and quality of food...not to mention how overpriced it was given the quality. 

It didn't help that I felt ill immediately after I ate -- my stomach literally ached -- and I got the runs ...it was as if my body was purging the food I had just consumed (my apologies for TMI). 

The all-you-can-eat garden salad was overdressed with sour dressing and had a bunch of spoiled lettuce bits and dry carrots. 

My dessert (doughnuts with tiramisu cream) was so greasy and tasted of old/overused oil + the tiramisu cream didn't taste anything like tiramisu ...it was more of a sweet lard. I ate only one of the three donuts. 

My friend ordered the peanut butter stack; it was so sweet and the brownie was so dry that she only had one forkful. I tried a sliver of the peanut butter stack and the only layer that was worth eating was the top layer which consisted of chocolate and peanuts. 

I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Never come back!!
Worse service, worse food.
The rice is undercooked, mussels are rubbery... Just one comment, my  homecooking is better than this!

They claimed to give u a free take out with a purchase of certain dish, they never come. Even I've asked, they pretended never happened because you have paid your bill!

For a hundred dollars meal for my family,  I rather buy few steaks or salmon to cook at home.

Worse come to worse, their funnel cake is garbage.

I never write any comments in my life but I must today.
I regreted never check this app before I go!!

I hope you won't be the next victim!"}
{"text":"Does anyone come here expecting Nonna's Sunday dinner? I surely don't think so. Nor do they come for a fine dining experience. But it's simple, tasty Italian food for a decent price. All You Can Eat bread, salad and soup is always a nice plus. Service is generally pretty good, but does seem to be stretched thin sometimes even on not very busy days. I've only been once recently after the renovations and it's a nice change in the interior."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of East Side Mario's but my boyfriend is so we end up here quite often. This particular location, however, has to be the worst when it comes to service. It's the location closest to my house so, sadly, we've been here a few times and I think only ONCE have I left feeling like I didn't have to complain about the service in one way or another... stay away from this particular location, if you can."}
{"text":"Service has seriously gone downhill at this location. Once upon a time this location used to be one of the best, but sadly that isn't the case. They are constantly understaffed therefore causing a wait time even at the oddest times. And when you get a table and served you get this odd sense that you are being rush, something you don't like to feel when you are paying for a nice dinner. The only plus point is the food is still pretty decent, it's just the service that shines a dim light on the whole experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Twenty five minutes to get our drinks after being seated. Slow service. Server repeatedly brought us the wrong stuff. The worst part was that both of our lasganas were cold in the middle. It tasted like it has been frozen and then reheated. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Been here many times since I lived in the area. On and off experience, had to wait 20 mins for a server to actually ask us for water and take our order. Also have to mention, came here with a friend once and I found a hair under my pasta. I had fettuccini and there was a long piece of hair under the pasta when I scooped it up. Told the server who told the manager and the manager says no one here has black hair. She basically wanted to say I planted it there. Funny thing was the server who was serving us had black hair. I wouldn't scoop up pasta to plant a piece of hair there on purpose. I got a 15% discount after as that is all they could offer. 

The other times I went was quick and fast. Portions are good and the typical free salad and bread was good too. Atmosphere is nice and always busy at dinner. Overall alright."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the service and food wasn't bad, but the second time was terrible. 

Our group of four waited for about 15-20 minutes to actually get the attention of the hostess. After about another 20 minutes, we still weren't seated yet, even when the restaurant was pretty empty. Tables weren't being cleared fast enough. There simply weren't enough servers. The service has definitely gone downhill.

We walked out and found another restaurant. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave disappointing reviews but I have to say this restaurant is far past its expiration date. The meal hasn't been revamped in years. What used to be charming and cute is now sort of tired. I'd give them another shot if they did some updating."}
{"text":"I think there might be something wrong with me, because I don't like East Side Marios. I don't find it particularly appealing, and yet everytime I get dragged here for birthdays or dinners we end up waiting for ages in a crowd of people to get a seat. Did I miss a memo or something? Is there some hidden beauty here? I always feel like a snob, but I just don't like it.

The food tends towards mediocre, the servers are always hurried and busy, and are often snotty too. Yeah, definitely not a fan. I can make my own crappy pasta in store bought sauce, I don't need to pay three times as much for an entrée. The décor does not appeal either. It just doesn't feel worth it."}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 stars.  

Came here for business lunch and ordered off their $9.99 lunch menu.  I must say that this is a fantastic menu with lots of great choices.  Today I had Minestone soup with a Turkey club.  I'd give this 4 stars out of 5 but my soup and sandwich were a bit salty!  Order was taken quickly and came out pretty fast also.  Service good and was content!"}
{"text":"Just don't. I kept going back despite cold food, bread and drinks that don't show up and $15 pasta I can make myself. 

Why do I waste my money? Deals and offers are bait and switch tactics and customer service is terrible. THIS  location is the only restraunt I felt okay leaving a $0 tip, it's  that bad.

If you want, I'll buy a $2 can of sauce and some dry pasta and cook you dinner, it's the same without the sass and frustration. 

Never again."}
{"text":"The service here sucks! It took over 10 mins for the server to take our drinks. Once arrived, she was not very nice. The hostess was clueless about the menu. The food was okay but the server was slow, she screwed up our order and messed up the receipt. A lunch for five took over 30 mins to get salad and soup; another ten mins to get food and about 20 mins to pay the bill. This place is a cluster****."}
{"text":"The bosses did all the work!  The male boss, hosting, bussing, and the female boss, running food and serving!  Totally short of staff!  Too much $14 per hour!  I wonder if their kids are cooking in the kitchen!  
Stay away from this restaurant!  Unless u effort to spend 2-3 hours for your meal!"}
{"text":"The service here is easily four or five stars - they bent over backwards to give us the best experience. Unfortunately the food is in such negative territory that 2 stars is the highest I can offer.  The food is bland and freezerific, which they attempt to compensate for (unsuccessfully) with giant portions and cheese."}
{"text":"Oiie. Dinner at this place is very.....I can't find the words. 
ESM is right outside the Sunridge theatre, so it makes for a convenient dinner outing before a movie. Plus it's fairly quick so it's a better option than fast food or eating cinema food.
But not by much. 
You kind of feel like you're in a cafeteria - loud, chaotic, mediocre food, functional tables (as opposed to comfortable, cozy, or cool). Lots of little kids, balloons, and employees who are trying but either lack the training to handle the situation or just don't care. 
We were sat at a high table and were told they didn't have any others available in the nearly empty restaurant when we arrived. Now I don't know if they were reserved but ESM doesn't strike me as a place that people would make a reso.  Our table top was so small we couldn't fit our three dinner plates on it. Everything was really slow and seemed disorganized. Our salad didn't arrive for about 15 minutes and when our meals arrived we had to get rid of the salad bowl and plate to make room, so no all you can eat there. Our drinks were never refilled, the cheese graders weren't working, and we couldn't get any employees attention when one of our meals did not arrive at our table, etc. 
I really like the salad and bread at ESM, but I really can't imagine ever going back there unless I was desperate."}
{"text":"Don't come here on a Wednesday unless you want to be surrounded by misbehaving children and have terrible service. I have never had such a stressful dining experience. Then the manager has the audacity to suggest that I sit in the bar. I don't want to sit in the effing bar unless I'm drinking. Sitting in the bar means bad service unless you're drinking and then it's usually bad service."}
{"text":"We have been back a few times with the kids since I wrote this review and I'm happy to report they are keeping the level of service up, even the portions have improved slightly. 

As a result I'm happy to add another star to their rating based on consistently good service over multiple visits."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and food. 

Our server looked like she hated her job. I did not see her smile once. Nonetheless, she still did her job. Took our order right and brought us everything we needed.

The food lacked effort. I had the chicken parmesan sandwich with the italian wedding soup. Both were put together very messy. The taste was ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I had some kind of ravioli with cheese inside, which was pretty good. I think that the prices are quite inflated though considering it's just pasta, bread, and salad which is primarily lettuce (you get unlimited quantities of the latter two). 

I'm not particularly crazy about anything in this restaurant (food, prices, or decor). The only thing I guess I liked was the service; the waiter I had was very friendly and tried to make conversation with us."}
{"text":"Came here one evening for dinner with my son. I had the linguine pasta with chicken as well as tomato soup. My son had burnt cheese pizza but they replaced it with a new one. Service was pretty good but took a while to get our dinner. Food was fantastic as always from ESM."}
{"text":"Service was ultra she this time. The kitchen was slow. People complained about having walked for an hour. We had two rounds of bread and salad and still waited a long time before our food came. I went even hungry anymore by then."}
{"text":"What can I say except the service sucks.  I don't exactly come here for the food.  We like the free bread and unlimited soup/salad but why do we have to ask so many times for it?

I remember going to this location with my cousin once and the girl said we could only pick one side... but what if my cousin had picked the salad and I had picked the soup?  I really need clarification on this.  She rolled her eyes at us but complied.

The other time I went here with a friend, she didn't bring us bread until we were half way into our entrees.

To sum it up, I'm okay with mediocre italian-ish food at this price point, as long as the service is at least mediocre as well... which it is not.  I'd rather go to the Old Spaghetti Factory, at least their bread/butter comes out and tastes good."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a family dinner. I made reservations for 8:45pm, but we didn't get seated until 9:15pm. They seemed a little under staffed, the hostess was running around doing multiple things instead of assisting the guests at the door. 

But anyway, our server was very nice and friendly. She brought us bread to start off. I thought the bread used to be garlic bread but now it's just a normal plain loaf of bread. In total we ordered 2 Chicken Parmesans ($19 each), 2 Veal Parmesans ($22 each), And the Lemon and Shrimp Spaghettini ($22). We were served unlimited soup and salad throughout the meal. We were supposed to also be served garlic bread as well but never got any. There are 3 soups to choose from (tomato, Italian wedding and minestrone) and 2 salads (Caesar and garden). The Caesar salad here is very good.

We ordered the Funnel Cake and New York Cheesecake for dessert. 

Overall the food was good, I wish there was more staff working, the poor servers looked stressed out as they had so much to do. I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I just could not avoid making the linkage to the Nintendo Mario characters....   

The food here was no joke... as I enjoyed the seafood linguine.  The service was excellent.  Best of all, the price was unbeatable for a sit-down restaurant in the middle of the high rent district in Toronto - next to the financial / convention centers.   

Good for both business, family or vacation meals."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place take my kids for lunch after a movie. Location is conveniently located close to all the shops and movie theater. Service was terrible. Took forever to take orders and waiting long time for food to arrive. Only thing that was good was garlic bread. Salad didn't look fresh and drenched in oil and soup was bland. Kids were starving by the time they got their meals but didn't even want to finish. When i finally got the bill, i noticed she overcharged me."}
{"text":"Service here is the worst. Once we were seated no server came by at all and 20 mins already passed. The restaurant was pretty dead. A group of people then sat down in front of us and the waiter acknowledged them then walked right passed us. We had to stop her just to get her attention and at that point she just said I'll help you out but then walked away again. We just left after and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Though the bar table we sat at was a tiny bit on the sticky side - the food was very good. Parking was substantial and very close and the value was great. 

I had steak, broccoli and potato wedges - all were good, but the steak was slightly over cooked and not medium rare (the most you want to cook a good steak), but the flavor was VERY good.

Staff was friendly - quick and I sure place to return to. However, there are lots of other places I want to try while in Canada!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in an unassuming intersection in downtown Toronto, this place is easy to miss.  Go in and try it! The service was good and the food is exactly as you expect of East Side Mario's."}
{"text":"Not a bad alternative to BP's, Ricky's, and the like.  Good pizza and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"You can't really complain about the prices because they have good deals. But complaining about the food is a different story. The service was amateur good, but we received coffee with lipstick on it...which completely makes me uncomfortable and paranoid with the rest of my meal. For the same price, you can get better, faster, healthier food at a place like Artisano Bakery."}
{"text":"We bought the wagjag deal, which you can only use Monday - Thursday.
Decided to come here on wednesday for early dinner 4:40pm, at this hour, there shouldn't be any problem right.. WRONG!!

No one at the reception area.. waited 5mins, i went and told the bartender girl, to call someone.  5 more mins go past.  I went to the back and asked someone else. My problem is the place is empty and i had to wait almost 10mins for someone to come greet us and seat us.
I believe the manager was the one who greeted us and apologized and warned us that its shift change, so the service may be a bit slow.

I personally think that they are very understaffed.5-6 occupied tables should not be enough to slow service down during a shift change.

Bread came very slow.  I could see that the manager was trying to make up for under staff situation by running around doing everything.  He was polite and friendly but the service wasn't there.  He gave me the salad and my wife the soup, its the other way around. He later asked me if i wanted more soup, it slipped his mind.  we told him that the plates on the table were dirty, he never got us new ones, or took the dirty ones away.  We just took plates from the next table.

Portions were ok, Waited a long time for food to come.

When we left around 6:45pm, there was still no receptionist.

0 stars for this experience
1 star for the food
3 stars for the manager trying make do with the short staff, but not enough.

So if you come here, and there is no receptionist, and you have to wait 5-10mins to get seated (while there are empty seats everywhere!!), then expect the same service i got.

Walk out!! not worth it."}
{"text":"A chain that was recommended to me by a local.  The service was fine; salads were fresh, and the pizza was pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"was not fond of this place.
service nice and polite, however, they did spill water and another time, almost knocked someone off their chair.

food - i think is the standard taste, did not enjoy at all though. got the big fat tony burger - burger patty (dryish) and a slight bit of pulled pork (not enough to enjoy i guess) cost 12.99, came with ceaser - medicore - but had real bacon bits which i loved.

location - good if within the area since it's near union station, skydome and cn tower. though i definitely would not ever come here or to any east side marios ever again, even with the soup and salad availability.

two thumbs doooown."}
{"text":"This place seems to get a fair bit of hate and while I don't think it's the best place to eat for it's price, nor do I think it deserves to get the low ratings it does.  Let me tell you why.

East Side Marios is located on the south end of Markville Mall's parking lot.  Since it's on it's own, there's a good amount of parking.  Rarely is the restaurant at full capacity but I'd still make a reservation if you go there around 7:00pm on a Friday or Saturday night.

The food there is fairly tasty.  I used to get the batta-boomers and when I did, they were really good (I only stopped because I found the main meal was enough to fill me).  I got the wings the other night but I didn't find them impressive.  I always get Make-You-Own-Pasta, in which you pick the noodle, sauce and side - with free all-you-can-eat soup or salad too.  They also give you fresh, warm bread (also free so you can have as much as you want).  I've had two of their three soups (Italian Wedding and Creamy Tomato, haven't tried their Minestrone) and both are extremely good - I can highly recommend either.  For the most part, the pasta's consistently good.  I once went and it was under lukewarm temperature, but the waitress had a fresh one made, no questions asked (probably a timing problem in the kitchen since my girlfriend's meal came hot).  I didn't make a big deal about it because it was my first problem with them in ten-plus visits.  The staff are generally very friendly.  You may need to give them a wave-down if it starts to get busy they haven't checked up on you for a while as they aren't the best at making sure they recheck all their tables.  I find there's always different waitresses working whenever I go so the place may have a high turnover so that might be slightly out of their control.

Like I mentioned above, it kind of varies on how busy they are in terms of service speed.  They have, however, come a long way since I first went there not long after it opened, mostly in the customer satisfaction department. I've never waited more then a few minutes for my bread and soup and appetizers tend to follow shortly after I'd finish that, with my dinner shortly after. This has been the timing almost every single visit so I'm not sure why so many people say they're 'that' slow.  And I've gone there over ten times by now.

East Side Marios has consistently good food and while it's nothing fancy, it's not nearly as bad as other people here claim they to be.  Do I recommend them?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative score I would 

This place has gone downhill since it's been here.

With dinner rush you'd think the staff would be more efficient. Nope with over 6 walk ins with parties averaging 2 to 6 ppl they refuse to not only open a closed side due to lack of servers ... even if they open 2 tables it would make ppl less annoyed. But with open tables in the dinner area they refused to seat them.

Clearly this is a restaurant with high school servers who can't handle the pressure of more than 2 tables. I this is why ppl go to Swiss chalet which is not only under the same chain of restaurants but clearly has been long enough to know how to properly manage and run a restaurant in a dinner rush time frame

The food was also soggy and lacked flavour... a high school cafeteria run by staff with tasteless bud's could have conjured a more flavorful experience. 

The only plus is the free WiFi which I'm using to post this review 

*AVOID THIS PLACE*"}
{"text":"My first one star.. Only because the food is so bland! Plus the bread is hard and dry, and the pasta is way overcooked... which is sad considering this is supposed to be an Italian restaurant :S
I do like the separate entrance for takeout."}
{"text":"I had an early lunch at East Side Mario's today.  I was seated on the dining room side.

Their meals come with all you can eat soup, salad and bread.  I had a bowl of Italian Wedding Soup ... it was a bit bland.

Stephanie, my server, also brought over some bread.  It was crusty on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  Yum!

I ordered the Four Meat \"Street Meat\" Pizzaroli ... I'd never had one before.  It was just okay ... I wouldn't get it again as I found it kind of greasy (not surprising, I guess, will all that meat inside).

Stephanie was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"I conducted one-on-ones for a client in Mississauga today and had lunch at East Side Mario's (Rodeo/Mavis).

Because of the heat (32C ... 42C with the humidity), they had the blinds pulled down to keep the restaurant cooler.

I ordered Mario's 16 Layer Lasagna.   It came with soup or salad and bread.  I got Italian Wedding Soup.  The soup was okay.  There were five small meatballs and a little bit of noodles in a bland broth ... I've had it heartier at other East Side Mario's.  I just ate the meatballs.  The bread was warm and delicious.

My lasagna was a lot sloppier than in the picture in the menu. It was good, though.  The sauce had burger and sausage in it and was slightly peppery.  A little more melted cheese on top would have been nice.

Lystra was my server and she took good care of me.  When she introduced herself when I sat down, I told her my name.  She used it every time she popped by to check on me."}
{"text":"We've tried other East Side Mario's and know what to expect.  I found the meal to be consistent, but the service at this location was lacking.  Three out of the party of 4 ordered the steak all done differently.  Only 1 was brought out correctly.  My husband predicted that would happen as the waitress didn't write anything down.  3 out of the 4 also ordered Caesar salad and the 4th ordered a garden salad.  The waitress brought out a large bowl of each so it was too much for the one, and not enough for the other 3.  She also only gave us 1 loaf of bread and never bothered to offer refills.  By the way it was not busy.  If it were up to me, I would have rather eaten at one of the many other restaurants that are very close, but someone from the group insisted on eating here."}
{"text":"Have never liked this restaurant... I dislike it even more now that I have food restrictions (I'm basically vegan).  After reviewing the allergen guide, I sent a message to the company a few days before my visit asking for some assistance with suggestions for what I could eat and they never replied. I don't see their salad dressings and a few menu items listed on the allergen guide -- They need to update it. I would have never come here if it wasn't my friend's birthday.

The service wasn't good either... We waited a long time for our food.. They also appear to be under staffed. The waiter was obviously rushing around trying to do his best. 

I don't know how this restaurant is popular... It's overpriced, very mediocre Italian food."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices are decent. Had to keep tracking down the waitress to get more bread, drinks, and the bill though!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? Went as a group of four and ordered our meals.  The caesar salad came with no cutlery.  We asked the waitress and she said they ran out of cutlery so are waiting for other people to finish.  How the hell does that happen!!!! As we watched our caesar salad for about fifteen minutes our meals came.  Still NO cutlery.  We asked her again.  She brought some, guess what, not washed!!!!!  Our food was dry and piping hot.  It either baked under a heat lamp or got nuked in the microwave.   At this point we asked for a manager.  Had no plans to yell but just wanted to leave.  She insisted we pay.  We explained the lack of utensils and that the food was simply disgusting looking.   She agreed but then proceeded to tell us its a busy night so these things happen.  No, only incompetence leads to this happening.   Anyway I told her I will give my number and if the district mgr would like to discuss my experience and still demand I pay then I will but I was confident she wouldn't want to explain to him why there was no cutlery.  Anyway, don't go here!!!! I've heard similar stories from people.  This place is a train wreck."}
{"text":"After a long day work we did drop in to have a nice and not to exclusive dinner. The server was a nice person and he was helpful and correct. We did order a main and did get also a nice piece of bread and could choose a starter. One of use had a tomato soup: good, and the other guy had a ceasarssalade: also good.
The maindisses are also oke. Did both had some pasta's and the are good. The firecracker was spice as told. So it was a good diner. We will be back but not tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food is OK but overpriced. Very popular with families, but they should keep kids out of the bar! Also the bar seems to be a popular hangout for staff at the end of their shifts - very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Wow, everyone really is hating on this place.  I thought they were great!  Shocked it got a 2/5 stars.

The bread and butter, my parents and I couldnt get enough of.  I thought our soup was delicious.  Great food, TERRIBLE service.  Our waitress was no where to be found.  I do like the deal they gave with the meal, salad or soup and mini dessert (that would be 2 spoonfuls).  Inside looked very New York-like which is obviously what they were trying to immitate.

I didnt like the front doors of the building, where you have to walk from the parkinglot and find your way to the entrance that's facing the main road, it's awkwardly positioned.

Other than that - can't complain!

Can someone PLEASE tell me what is in that seasoning they have on the table?! IT IS TO DIE FOR!"}
{"text":"Bad service! I will never come back..We have talk with the manager, but this guy don't care about costumers I just waste the money."}
{"text":"Was at East side for dinner. Service was super slow while the place was empty. Took them 10 mins to seat us and 0 acknowledge."}
{"text":"My family and I have been visiting this particular East Side Mario's for probably around a decade, as we live very close by, and it always had decent food for decent prices. Of particular note was the half priced wings nights, when we ate here the most.

Lately however, this restaurant has gone downhill. Even though we are known there as regulars, it is no reason to ignore us as customers. On several occasions our orders have been wrong, late, or forgotten altogether. Some servers there (who have been with this location for a while) need to be retrained on proper - and timely - service.

Thankfully, a Buffalo Wild Wings has recently opened in the same plaza. While I preferred the small \"family restaurant\" atmosphere of East Side Mario's, I just simply can't ignore the terrible service anymore."}
{"text":"Decent dinner though I'll be honest I had a gift card I wouldn't pay my hard earned cash to eat here.

This location honestly has awful customer service. The waitresses don't write anything down and most times I've been here either an entree was missed or the wrong dish came out. They could do with some retraining....not like it's the cheapest place to eat.

I wouldn't eat here again...go to keys or Swiss chalet or even pizza hut across the street where you won't be treated like an afterthought or inconvienence. Portion sizes are way too big, I wish the quality was higher and portions were human sized not army sized so there wasn't so much waste.

This specific location is constantly plagued with issues, for example:
- on my most recent trip our mains came first, salad came when I asked twice and no appetizer came so we cancelled it. Waitress wrote nothing down which is probably why it was all downhill. Any compensation? Nope because they could care less.
- last March I was there for my birthday and the power went out and the manager wanted my boyfriend to leave his credit card number to pay for the meal - douche move. Any compensation? Nope because they could care less.
- a friend and I were there in December and the debit machines weren't working luckily we had cash but wtf?! Any compensation? Nope because they could care less.

Seriously a dump and food us mediocre at best...support local eateries that do Italian right."}
{"text":"Dreadful customer service!!! I had to complain about the portion sizes they served us.  I ordered the build your own fettuccine Alfredo and they produced a child size portion in an adult plate. I expressed my concern with the waiter and he laughed then offered to have a manager come speak to us.  After expressing my concern to her, she shrugged and told me that's just how it is. She reluctantly offered to remove my order from the bill. The food was disgusting anyway!! Cold. Not cooked properly. The sauce tasted like they poured it straight from the jar over the fettuccine.  I will never dine here again!! Off to find some real food!"}
{"text":"Ughhhh I really want to like this ESM but they're consistently crappy in terms of their speed of service. We've ordered delivery more than once and waited OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF for our food to arrive each time. What????

The last time, our food arrived hot but my cappeletti were half hard on the inside and my salad had brown edges. Like really? I used to work at ESM in Pickering and I was in charge of delivery service and I would have NEVER sent out brown lettuce. I also consistently get the heart of a head of lettuce in my container - that's not edible and I don't want it on my plate. 

Seriously ESM, get your act together! Stop sending out crappy food and get faster at it. I don't care how busy your dining room is, 1.5 hours plus for delivery is UNACCEPTABLE when we're ordering basics that take less than 10 minutes to put together and salads that are already made. 

We'll be avoiding this location from now on and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant for years and actually worked there for a time. The food rarely disappoints - the management are actually the owners and you can really tell that they care about their business and their customers. Going in on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll usually find Diane, one of the owners, at the front greeting customers, chatting with people waiting to be seated, and generally keeping the atmosphere at the entrance upbeat.

This location was renovated about 6 or so years ago and the renovations have made it much brighter and a much nicer place to eat. The bar definitely had the most significant upgrade, gorgeous wooden booths and multiple TV screens; very popular for game nights (NHL playoffs were on the night we visited). This location offers 1/2-price appetizers between 4-6 and after 9 on most (if not all) evenings.

You can't go wrong with Cappelletti, Amatriciana or Tettrazini pasta dishes - all taste great and the portions are large. With the unlimited soup/salad/bread, you'll likely have leftovers for lunch the next day. 

Service here varies; the younger staff seem to be much more upbeat and enjoy their jobs more so than some of the older/veteran staff, which, I suppose, is to be expected. We dined here last week and unfortunately got a server who approached our table, asked us how we were, and when we didn't return the question to her, blurted out \"i'm fine thanks for asking\". She seemed to have an attitude on for most of the evening and while I didn't pay, it would have certainly affected any tip she would have gotten from me. I generally got the sense that not many people working that night were enjoying their jobs at all - being a server can be a grueling job but I don't think I saw more than 2 servers smile the entire time we were there.

Overall, a good place to eat with some friendly staff. Watch what time you go, because the dinner rush here is absolutely crazy as not only do they get regular business, but they get walk-ins from the mall which makes Friday/Saturday nights pretty busy - but its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here with my coworkers and got the spaghetti lunch special for $10. The lunch portion is definitely smaller so you pay for what you get. 

The pasta is mediocre. I have certainly tried better pastas in other American chains. The pasta I had was more in the oily side. 

The service here is very attentive. The waiter came to check up on us and asked us if we wanted more bread."}
{"text":"Love it here... they have changed as I gave up on them for a few years.
Started again for a year... Once a month on a Tuesday... service and food is delish.
I love their tomato herb sauce... even if a dish is only tomato sauce... i ask for the tomatoe herb (with basil)
Portions are usually spot on... a couple of time it was on the lower side.
Soup is usually Italian wedding or Tomato.
Bread loafs are free and as many as you like."}
{"text":"We like to go here for have salad with their dinners.  The garden salad is great especially with the dressing on the side.  We have tried the zucchini frites and they are quite tasty as well.

We've tried the pizza and it's fairly tasty, slightly better than I would have expected it to be at a francise.

I like the Hell's Chicken which is quite spicy and tasty.  Our friends ordered the steak there, I wouldn't recommend it, it was overcooked and fatty.  Everything else aside from the steaks seem to be good there.

If you have a sweet tooth and like peanut butter I suggest you try the peanut butter stack dessert at least once but don't expect to finish it as it's really rich.  It's sweet, crunchy, and chocolate combined with a hint of peanut butter."}
{"text":"We came there in August, the AC was busted, we were seated in a corner, the place was full of clutter. there was dust everywhere. It was so hot and uncomfortable. We asked for some water to start off with, it came 10 mins later and looked dirty, had something floating there. We just stood up and left. I really liked the Pickering location, this one was awful. Sad."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Been here for an hour and a half currently and have been starting at empty appetizer plates for 15 minutes. We really enjoyed the experience we had about a year ago. Tonight, I am hoping the food will be worth the hour and a half wait."}
{"text":"Always a friendly staff and fast xeroxed big fancy restaurant love it, has a pizzeria right in the restaurant"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this East Side Marios. It's usually one of my favorite restaurants but this location soured my whole outlook on the chain.

Turns out there were being mystery shopped that day and we could feel the pressure. They had staff clearing our plates before we were even done eating off of them. I found that extremely rude. I also didn't enjoy being asked FOUR times during my main course, if the food was okay. IO spoke with the manager and clearly told her were were NOT the mystery shoppers and asked if we could eat in peace - 2 minutes later, yet another waitress was over. I wanted to get up and walk out!"}
{"text":"We came here because it was right outside the MTCC & wanted lunch. We decided on take out so we wouldn't have to sit & wait too long. But heck! We ended up waiting an HOUR for our take out. I was starving by then. I had the portobello Padini (sp?). The food was passable. But nothing special. Next time I won't order food here. The lady who took our order was acting as bartender & hostess so she stepped away quite a bit. She also couldn't seem to figure out how to punch in our orders. I think the staff here need a lesson in efficient customer service."}
{"text":"Our waitress was kind of lackadaisical but she improved throughout our meal. The food was fresh & delicious. As usual you get the salad & bread first. Bread isn't as yummy as past visits but oh well. Salad was the standard Cesar Salad with bacon bits. I had the Bruschetta Pizza which although simple was delicious. I left feeling stuffed. Hubby had the Spaghettini with meat balls. A good, decent meal & decent service."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and reasonable prices. Very big portions so I recommend sharing or going when you're really hungry.
A must try are the mozzarella sticks! 
( It's a pretty long drive from Saint- Sauveurs, 15/ 20 min so take a car or try an uber)"}
{"text":"I love ESM because of their kid friendly atmosphere, but this location was incredibly disappointing. The place is dirty and dusty, all the chandeliers are covered in dust and they're hanging right above the tables. They had no colouring pages and their espresso machine was broken.  This place looks really run down, not to mention that the staff look like they all partied hard the night before."}
{"text":"Haven't been to an East Side Mario's in a while. Yes they still have the bottomless salad and all you can eat garlic bread with just about any entrée which is great. The place seems to be trying to update itself to be more high class but it has yet to succeed. 

The food is okay. A lot of noodle and sauce with a little bit lacking in the cheese and meat department. The pasta I had tastely like the meat was not grade A but other than that, it was ok. I guess I would give it a 2 star if it was not for the all you can eat stuff."}
{"text":"BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!

Initially, I did not want to eat at this East Side Marios after looking at the Yelp rating and an \"okay\" experience years ago. But choices were limited for my mom and I, so I went along.

This location is pretty big and when we entered, there was basically no line, we were greeted and escorted to our seats. Although, when we left, there was a significant line. 

Our server was amazing. His name was Tony and he was quick and very helpful with the menu and food. 

At the time, there was a special promotion going on where you order a dish from a selection of dishes and they'll give you a dish for free to bring home. The bring-home pasta was \"eh\" but wasn't horrible. 

I enjoyed the AYCE bread and salad. Both were good and what I expected. I got the double bacon carbonara and it was DELICIOUS! I'd definitely go back and order that again. Tony was even able to bring extra pasta sauce on the side and asked if I'd like parmesean shaved in front of me.

Considering price, quality, and service, I did have a good time and will look forward in coming back. East Side Mario's is kinda the kid/family version of Scaddabush when you think about it."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and went in despite my gut instinct.  Service was a little slow, but courteous.  Bread and Italian wedding soup were good, but entree was not.  Built my own pasta.  Decided to try the GF penne and rose' sauce, with meatballs and baked cheese.  Sauce was bland, the meatballs were mushy and tasteless, and there was sliced chicken that looked like tofu buried in the bottom.  Complete waste of money and a meal."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a coffee and BLT with a colleague from work.  Service was good, food was OK, typical east side Mario's food, decent value for what you get."}
{"text":"ESM is one of the older restaurant chains around and is clearly showing its age. 

Just take a look at the well handled and poorly cleaned menus that have never been updated. I swear I was ordering from the same one when I was 16 and being dropped off at the movies by my parents. 

The interior hasn't changed in the last decade+ either. I'm not even sure it's been cleaned thoroughly either as every photo on the wall has smudge finger prints all over them. 

Notwithstanding all of the above criticism, we had a very pleasant meal tonight. Our waiter, Zach, was attentive and very sweet. An excellent balance of checking in and leaving us alone. Which is a lost art! 

In terms of the food: The salad was fresh and exactly the way I ordered it. My personal pizza was delicious!!! My bf enjoyed his pasta. 

Overall, ESM is sorely in need of a re-branding and a little innovation."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I don't know why people are writing bad reviews.
Our server Edith was so nice and was on top of things. She was fast and greeted us well.
My family and I got the ribs. It was good. You can substitute your side with anything. You also get all-you-can-eat soup or salad and garlic bread with most meals."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, quick service for a Friday night but food was just as good! Bring on the unlimited soup/salad."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to eat here on a Thursday night and the place was super packed. We waited about 20 minutes to get a table, which was understandable since they were that busy. When we got seated our waiter was extremely friendly! I was amazed by how nice he was and he definitely made the overall experience more enjoyable. The food was also really good! The portions were just right and I loved how they served us bread while we waited."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for dinner because it was in the mall and it looked festive. Hubs ordered the Calamari Al Diavolo Pizza. The pizza looked weird because of the calamari rings on top of the pizza. It looked like onion rings! But, surprisingly, it tasted pretty good. Daughter and I ordered the Build Your Own Pasta. She had the bowtie pasta with bolognese sauce and shrimp and loved it. She thought it was a nice combination. I had the Spaghettini with arrabbiata sauce and primavera vegetables. It tasted ok. I also had the Italian Wedding soup which was very salty and I couldn't finish it. Service was very friendly and quick, though."}
{"text":"I haven't been to east side Marios in years because of the last time I went it was horrible service, bad management and the food had went off a Grand Canyon size cliff, but today it was really good we got there around 630 so should have been busy for a Friday night at prime dinner time, the parking lot had a fair amount of cars we got inside gave them my name, the hostess said it would be a few minutes to get seated, it litterly only took a few minutes to get seated, we sat down the waiter was at the table fast took our drink orders right away so we order our appetizer, and then the food, I ordered a chicken, pasta and tomato dish that was spicy the waiter warned me it was a bit spicy, I asked how spicy he said mildly spicy so I said that was ok, my daughter ordered the spaghetti & bolinaise sauce, hubby got the steak, we get our yummy salad and yummy bread, the deep fried raviolis come they were tastey we get another bowl of yummy salad and another yummy bread and then the food came, my daughter and hubby's food is cooked perfect, mine was really good but a few bites in oh lord here came the heat, then the hot food sweats started my ears were burning from the inside out, my nose turned into a faucet, the waiter came to find out how dinner was I made the it's very spicy wave in front of my mouth, he instatly offered to have the kitchen make me a new one that wasn't spicy before I could say ok he had it and was having another one made I apologized and told him I should have listened to him,  he said it was ok, he said it would be 3 minutes for my new food, when my food came about 3 mins later, I apologized again for having to send it back I said it was really good it just had more heat than I could take today, he said it was really ok that they are use to sending it back and he warns everyone when they order it so today they get 5 stars for great service and really good food, it seems there is a new manager he seemed ss if the staff liked him and not afraid of him, they remodeled the inside it looks great, I'm glad we took a risk and decided to give them a retry we will have  to add it back to the don't feel like cooking and really want yummy salad and yummy bread and if I have to take home the main meal it's ok I am however I'm sad they got rid of the whipped butter it was so good it made the bread a 10 yummy but right now it's a 5 yummy just wish I hadn't been so full i was wanting to try some of the new desserts they had on the menu, I guess next time"}
{"text":"Blech! Never again.

Visited ESM on a Sunday for lunch. We've dined here once before since my boyfriend won't stop raving about their unlimited salad and bread. I hated the food last time, and I hated it even more this time for lunch. 

On a Sunday for lunch, the restaurant wasn't packed like our previous visit. Waiting to be seated at this restaurant would be a joke. Please do your palette a favour and turn elsewhere. 

Service was fine, oddly enough we had the same server as our first visit. She was nice, with bright red hair and lots of tattoos. The only thing I found odd was she got rid of my boyfriends half-eaten caesar salad when she dropped off his pasta dish... It was clearly not finished and we assumed she'd bring back a full one since it was unlimited... Or so we thought.

A loaf of garlic toast was served after we placed our orders. Standard garlic loaf- at least it was warm.

Throughout my meal I was miserable as I knew I wouldn't like the food. At $9.99/ pasta I would expect something much better. I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was unmemorable. Michelina's frozen pasta dishes are 10x better than the pasta here.

I sat there, picking out the edible things- bland, frozen chicken, mushrooms, red and green peppers. The linguini left untouched, as it was extremely soggy and drenched in their \"rose\" sauce which had zero flavour.

I knew what I had gotten myself into, and I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. My advice? Stay away, buy some Classico pasta sauce and mix it with some veggies and you've got a meal 100x better than any pasta served here. Gross."}
{"text":"Had the worst service of my life un the bar area by a female bartender on a Sunday so when my son wanted to go for Mothers day i was dreading it. To my surprise the hostess was lovely but it was our server Hector who is a 5 star best service i have had in years! Food is good too i recomend the calmari served in a hot skillet kids pasta big serving. Thanks Hector for changing our experience"}
{"text":"Couples BEWARE: I brought a very special guest & we selected 1 of the larger & more expensive main dishes stating clearly -in writing on the menu- that diners are entitled to UNLIMITED salad, (or soup) and garlic bread. The server brought the entree divided into 2 bowls (even though that was neither offered, nor requested) & after ONE round of salad, and ONE garlic bread, we were IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY CUT OFF. When I politely asked why we were forced to forfeit the unlimited aspect of the meal deal, the server tried to hastily squash the issue with some sort of well-rehearsed rebuttal comparing our visit to Mandarin all you can eat buffet. A pathetic and insulting attempt at employing some kind of 'fair usage' clause. She brought out ONE more lousy garlic bread as a consolation, and then the bill. Nevertheless, I left a good tip, but walked out feeling annoyed, embarrassed, and very bitter about the whole experience. Unfortunately, these folks chose short-term gain over long-term gain, as this location is close to our home & we would have been happy to make it a regular habit. Now, we'll never go back & I'll be sure to squash the suggestion if any of my friends consider it."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad rating, but this location of East Side Mario is terrible. From the service to the quality of food. My Pizza was okay but the salad my friend got had the whole stock of lettuce. Also the pasta was drenched in the oil. Now to the service, the service was terrible. asked for water multiple times and didn't get it. Also not once did they come by to check on use or ask us how we were doing... It wasn't busy... Will never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"After a shopping trip to Ikea nearby, we settled for some Italian- American comfort food, excited by the idea that we could \"pig\" out on their all-you-can-eat salads and bread.

This is a casual family dining restaurant, reminiscent of Olive Garden for their menu options, minus the overall warmth and look of the place. Service is snappy, almost excessive, I had a feeling they wanted to take our orders as soon as possible and rush us out of there. We weren't even done looking at the menu and the waitress had come by three times asking if we were ready. Since it was only a bit past 5 pm, we informed her that we'd start with salad and would like to wait before ordering our main meals. Barely through our first plate of cesar salad, which by the way is a good mix of creamy and garlic-y, our pastas had arrived. We didn't want to send them back for our meals would get cold, but again I felt too great of an urgency on their behalf. The restaurant was half empty, it's not like they needed to turn tables that quickly.

I opted for the firecracker shrimp bowtie pasta which is a mix of sauteed shrimps, tossed vegetables and pasta in a primavera sauce. Great flavors, but very oily. my partner had a monstrous looking 16 layer lasagna, the pasta to filling ratio was off. I don't understand how anyone could eat 4 inches of stacked noodles.

In terms of price and portion, East Side is satisfactory."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I ordered a gluten free pizza. The pizza it's self only comes with cheese and then they charge you $1.50 per topping. I thought this was pretty expensive but the entire menu seems to be that way. 

The food and service is really great. Just need to work on the price IMO."}
{"text":"This restaurant was decent. Prices were reasonable though, especially if you get the entree + movie pass deal for $20. 

The fries we got with a half chicken dinner were caked in salt, we sent them back because they were unedible. But the remaining 3 entrees (2 pastas and 1 salmon) were pretty good. 

Caesar salad here has gotten so much better from the one I used to go to in Waterloo. The dressing isn't runny, its thick and they seem to use real bacon as well. 

Overally I'd give them a 3.5/5 but since there's no half stars here, they get a 3. I'd go here maybe once every 6 months."}
{"text":"I believe that East Side's is ingrained in Canadian culture almost to the extent that Swiss Chalet is. I have been going to various East Side's for years and have seen a bit of an evolution.

For the longest time they have had a menu that rarely changed. I went for the first time in a while and noticed that they now have a separate lunch menu (for faster serving times and smaller lunch portions). I've also noticed they are adding new items while keeping the staples (like create your own pasta and chicken tetrazini) on the menu. I have noticed the prices creep up, and the AYCE salad and bread comes with fewer items.

We had a large group last time I was in (15+ people), and our server did a good job of keeping us satisfied. The meals came out in a timely manner and came out together. Kudos to the whole staff.

One menu item that looks and smells absolutely amazing is the calamari. It comes served on a sizzling hot skillet mixed in with some peppers, tomatoes, and onions. I wasn't the one that ordered it, but I would recommend trying this out if you enjoy calamari.

One of the few drawbacks of this place (but I'm not sure if this is a permanent thing), is that our butter was not whipped.

I caution people who have never been to East Side's that this isn't authentic Italian food, so don't get your hopes up.

All things considered, this place is still one of the better places to stuff your face for relatively few dollars."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very disappointed with our visit to this East Side Mario's location. They took a long time to seat us, and the service was spotty. 

We both ordered the veal sammy. I had ordered this particular sandwich a few years back at the Bowmanville location, and it was amazing. 

Well it was not amazing here in Pickering. Instead of being on a kaiser, it was on tasteless ciabatta bread. There was only one pithy slice of veal, and there were far too many red onions. As well there was a spice/flavour that tasted absolutely awful and made it almost inedible. 

When we asked about it, our server explained that the menu had changed due to the minimum wage increase. One of the changes was the bread, and portion of this particular sandwich. Of course it still showed the old style in the actual menu! Totally false advertising. 

The garlic bread that they brought us was the only saving grace of the meal. 

We were very disappointed and will never eat at East Side Mario's again."}
{"text":"Haven't had East Side Mario's in quite a while, and to be honest, only tried this place because it was nearby. 

The dining experience here didn't start off well, as we were greeted by hostesses  telling us that they could only accept cash payments. Since their debit/credit card machines were not working (all of them?) members of our group had to go out of their way to seek out a bank machine. Not sure why East Side's didn't make more of an effort to rectify this, as I saw groups leaving because of this, and not coming back.

After deciding to stay anyway, we had to wait for more than 30 minutes just be seated - not because there weren't enough tables (there were plenty), but because they were under-staffed. This was surprising, as most high-traffic restaurants should have a reasonable expectation of the amount of servers they will need on a busy Saturday night. Eating at as many places as I have, I also believe that management could have handled this more effectively, such as having the hostesses assist with waiting tables for simple orders, or at least seating customers first to allow them to peruse the menu with some water - this is pretty standard practice actually among well-run restaurants.

The food itself is what you would expect here - not the highest quality pasta or pizza, but was adequate. My baked penne dish had ample amounts of mozzarella, and enough pasta, but nearly non-existent beef. After picking up my plate, digging deep into the pasta, and looking VERY closely, I found some tiny bits of ground beef in there!

We took advantage of the $12 unlimited salad and soup option, was was as advertised. The restaurant did uphold it's promise, and gave us refills as we requested. Despite subpar service from the hostesses, the waitresses that assisted us were actually fairly attentive and friendly.

Probably won't be back here, unless I have a sudden craving for about 7 bowls of 'wedding mix' soup."}
{"text":"Took entirely too long bring drinks, serve food, bring check.  No water refills, salad was too big and entree was too small.  This was for lunch and the place seemed to be severely understaffed. There was even a guy who sat down, and lost his patience and left after waiting for the waitress to stop by.

Food was okay though."}
{"text":"Service is barely mediocre, and the menu is very misleading. My boyfriend and his friend ordered Veal Parmigiana. Where the description said it features 2 lightly breaded Veal cutlets, they both received one small cutlet. To top it off, it was served overcooked and nearly impossible to chew. We confronted our server about this, who called over the manager only to have him say they changed the portion to keep it as one piece rather than have it cut in half like they usually do (this still does not explain how small the cutlet was nor did they tell us why the menu was incorrect). Management did nothing to resolve this and only told us as it was. Furthermore, our server took down our other friend's order completely wrong (while failing to apologize to him), making him wait longer for his food, which unsurprisingly also came overcooked. Overall, our food portions were too small to fill us up and we ended up ordering fast food afterwards. Needless to say, we will never visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this location and to be honest I dont know how they're still in business.

Over the last few years nothing has changed, the food is insipid at best and service has been terrible with a complete lack of attentiveness along with a total lack of facility upkeep.

On this occasion the restaurant was virtually empty yet somehow my waitress was rarely ever seen except to take our order and give us our bill. No refills were offered at any point and we were made to feel like we were a burden. I felt our waitress had other things better to do than serve us or even ask how out meal was.

Our starters came and we didnt have cutlery, no one was on the floor for a good 20 minutes I had to chase down another waitress and ask her for cutlery even she didn't bother to get us any. Eventually about 30 minutes after our starters arrived at the table I manager to find a supervisor only after waving my warms around like there was an emergency haha.

Once our entrees arrived I noticed my lasagna was completely empty, only the top had sauce and cheese, there was literally nothing in between the pasta sheets. I was shocked that the kitchen would let at dish that clearly didn't meet standards out.

I showed this to the manager and she simply said she would take it off the bill. No genuine effort was made to make our experience any better at all.

And to top it off the bathrooms were in disgusting condition completely dilapidated and without any soap or hand towels.

I'm going to reach out to corporate headquarters, I feel an immediate change in management is needed. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"My visit to this location, which was pretty empty considering I went during prime dinner time. 

I think the food and service may have a little bit to do with the lack of patrons here.

The servers were friendly but slow, and spent more time talking to each other than the tables they were serving. 

I ordered the Penne Alfredo with Broccoli, and it arrived with no Alfredo sauce. I explained that to my server (who took 10mins to come back out on the floor) even showed her it was dry except for the water which drained from the 1/2 cooked huge stalks of broccoli.  She offered to bring me some Alfredo to add to it - that came quickly enough, and so did the extra charge on the bill of $1.39 for something they should have added in the 1st place.

The server had already gone for the night when I noticed the charge.  Not nice East Side!!!

Instead of apologizing - they bilked me for more $$. 

I'll give them an extra star Bcus the Italian wedding soup is so delicious. Although it's not made there and comes pre-cooked. Lol.

Think I'll stick to the Eglinton / Warden location from now on"}
{"text":"I used to love going to ESM.  Their service was really good and we used to receive large portions of pasta.  Now, I've found that their service has gone down & the portion-size has dropped significantly.  
The only reason I go there is because they have a special for kids on Mondays for $2.  The burgers in the kids menu is quite big for kids, but the kids love the bread.
We ordered:  Susage & Pepper Penne, and Linguine Chicken Amatricana.  Both meals were average."}
{"text":"Still not good, even after new management. The food takes extremely long to come, the food is not fresh. I don't know quite frankly what's going on here."}
{"text":"The food is great each time I go there. I tend to fill myself up with the all you can eat salad bowls and bread, but yet I can't help finishing my main meal because it's always too tasty to stop. The serving sizes are pretty generous too. So, therefore each time I tend to leave the restaurant overstuffed. 
The service has been quite efficient and friendly. My favourite menu choices are the chicken picatta and the Hells kitchen chicken.
I'm definitely a fan and recomennd this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for a nice lunch with my mother. We walked in and went straight to the bar section. We sat down and then we were asked to go back to the front to wait to get seated.. I didn't know we had to be sat on the bar section!? After waiting 10 mins in the front because there were large parties, we got sat in the exact same spot we sat in before being asked to leave. 

Once we were sat, we waited 9 mins before ANYONE came. Though and behold it is the server who asked us to go back to the front, her name was Tiffany. We asked for a bottle of wine and 5 mins later she arrived with the bottle and placed our bottle and 2 glasses on the table and walked away... She did not open the bottle, did not pour us our first glass. It was horrible service. I did not know we were at a all you can eat buffet and we had to serve ourselves. 

I will never return back to this location."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was no one at the hostess station and we waited a long time for someone to come over and seat us. When we were finally seated we waited a long time for someone to take our order even though we saw servers. After the waitress finally took our order she left abruptly without asking if we prefer the soup or salad. When she brought the drinks over we asked why the complimentary bread and soup or salad wasn't included. She said that it was and she forgot it was included with the meals. How can she take orders all the time and forget its included. We waited a long time for our food to arrive and had two loaves of bread which were both way over cooked and not edible. My pasta tasted like hospital food. We wanted dessert but didn't order it because we wanted to leave as soon as possible because of the service and the quality of the food. I've been to other East Side Marios which were much better."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with my family. Food was as expected at East Side Mario's but the service was too notch. Food can out quick, kids meals were perfect for them. Even the twisty straws. Would definitely recommend this place for a family night out."}
{"text":"I like the Hells Kitchen Chicken and their wings.

You wouldn't think of East Side Mario's as a place with good wings, but give it a try.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The size of the wings are good, and the sauce is different.

You get unlimited breadsticks when you purchase an entree.  They're delicious!

Service is always good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday around 1pm. Took less than 5 mins to be seated.  Our waitress had checked with us couple times.  Satisfied with the overall restaurant experience.  Sunday 1 free kids meal per adult purchase of $14.99 or more."}
{"text":"I think the head office needs to step foot in this restaurant and fix the service before the name is ruined. I've been to tons of East sides and the Whitby location is awful. I live in Brooklin and will drive to Oshawa instead of this location which is much closer. Service is terrible, food is awful. 
It use to be good, now it's just plain awful
Yes I have tried this many times just to see if it's an off day but it's not. 
As many reviews have stated it's unfortunatly gone way down hill."}
{"text":"Service was great. Our server did a task good job keeping out cups full. Did was okay.. nothing amazing.. but the service was the best ice had in a LONG time.. most people don't give a family of good service, but I will be back... just for the good service... 
Food did take a bit to get out.."}
{"text":"Not my first choice to eat but my nieces wanted to come and eat here.  Food is okay nothing too special. Some meals come with unlimited soup and/or salad.  I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad for the waiters. The service was good, relatively speaking. I ordered the '16 layer lasagna' at 18.99$, apparently a signature dish. It was bland, the meat was rubbery, and the center of the lasagna was still cold. Definitely won't be coming back. Two stars for the waiters' effort"}
{"text":"Rob & I got to enjoy this Chinook location at least once, so we're grateful for that. The waitress was fairly friendly, and we got free salad and free bread, we were almost too full to order after that lol. The decor was very \"New York\". When we tried to go here again not so long ago, we were told it's permanently closed. Just thought we'd share that, but don't worry, there are other locations in Calgary :)"}
{"text":"Had a closer ESM near home but the wind brought me to this one:) and I'm happy about it. The service was great. Food as always just right (I am a fan of ESM since it's one of the few places where I can get my kid to eat something). What I found great was the waitress, she was very cute and sweet. She didn't shout across the whole restaurant asking me if my kid can have ice cream for desert (which 99% waitresses do, and then you have to be the bad guy if you say no ice cream to your munchkin), she came close to me and whispered, asking if she can get my kid a little bit of ice cream. She brought 3 tiny-weeny little baby cones with ice cream, so cute and yummy. THANK YOU! (Oh, I said yes to ice cream btw:) AND she brought my kid a cute keepsake
I  will go back!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience today at ESM. My server was a girl named Andrea and she was so amazing.  Everything came out on time: appetizers, salad, warm garlic bread, main course. Drinks on time.  My kid happy:) Ah, what a nice experience. And let me say 50% of the whole dining experience is service.  Never accept a restaurant where you am not treated right, I rather eat microwave food then let anyone sour my mood.  I am a regular at ESM and at this location probably few times b4, never left disappointed and would definitely come back. 
Hint** Ask for Andrea;) she is an angel"}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars
Service- 2 stars

My husband and I went to this place for lunch. My husband ordered a one person pizza mean and I ordered a one person pasta meal. The food was very good especially the veggie pizza we ordered, but like it is mentioned in other reviews the service was below average.
We had to  ask our server to get us some bread as he didn't get any and calmly got our meals out.... after that my meal included a salad an entree and a dessert and the server didn't even ask me what I wanted for dessert and got the bill out. At that time we both didn't realize and so we just paid the bill and left. After we came to the hotel I mentioned to my hubby and we went and checked the deal online... IT INDEED INCLUDED A DESSERT. We both were pretty pissed at there service!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this ESM location a few times, always for lunch. It is a good place for lunch  - they get you in and out of there quickly, but deliver a good selection of lunch items. I've had the grille chicken panini, the chicken parmesan sandwich and the tuscan turkey wrap. All were very good. Staff here is also very good and handles large groups well."}
{"text":"I don't mind it. You get what you pay for, mostly, and prices are quite cheap. But there's free bread, and any place that serves free bread is a win in my book. I haven't had any negative experiences here. Wait staff is friendly and accommodating. The decor is nice, typical american italian/pizza jiint style. Seems clean. The drinks are good, the food is decent enough. Sure, it's most definitely Americanized Italian food, but if you don't mind that fact, then you'd probably be okay with going here."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and bad.
We requested our salad with no bacon because we are Muslims. But there was small pieces of bacon in the bottom of the salad. I had to throw up when I tasted the bacon. And when i told the servant she was rude and she said there was no pork in our food. 5 min later we found another piece of bacon in the bottom of the salad. And when I tried to show it to the manager. The manager was like \"I have been here for 5 days only. And I don't know what's going on\"
Staff disrespectful and food quality is bad"}
{"text":"It was very busy we went on a Saturday night. 

The only good thing was their all you can eat fresh bread, although we got one that was still frozen in the centre so that was a little off putting. 

Their Cesar salad had LOTS of dressing and the croutons are extremely hard. Over all it is similar quality to a Macdonalds salad or some place similar. 

We both got the penne broccoli alfredo and it was extremely bland. The broccoli was very watery and obviously previously frozen. 

Overall the service was quick and the food came out fast but it is massed produced and probably came out of a can, so big whoop. 

Overall it is a more expensive fast food restaurant. There are much better Italian places in the area!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I walked in my my parents and it was quite busy. The hostess said there was a 25 minute wait and we could wait at the bar. We began to realize that we had been forgotten.  After 10 minutes customers who came in after us were getting seated. 10 minutes after that we asked a staff member if we could get a table. He said he didn't know. And after speaking to a bar manager he couldn't help us either.  So we left. Really disappointed with how disorganized the staff were."}
{"text":"Never been to east side marios before so my boyfriend and I thought we should give it a try tonight. It was very empty when we walked in at 9pm and got a seat right away.

We ended up sitting there for 30 minutes trying to flag down someone to come take our order. No one came by to ask us what we wanted to drink or if we were ready to order. The place was very empty and there were probably 2-3 other families there at the time. If the staff had enough time to put plates on an empty table they had the time to come see how we were doing.

After waiting a little more we noticed that the family that got here after us got their food and we still haven't been able to order. We decided to just get up and leave. Very disappointing first experience.

The inside pages of the menu were also very wet and sticky. Please check to make sure they are dry before giving it to a customer. 

Very disappointing first experience. We decided to go to Milestones for pasta instead."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour...for salad. When the food came an hour and half later, the chicken for the kids meals was as hard a rock. The temperature inside was hotter than outside! There's a reason why this restaurant has only 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my son. He ordered chicken fingers and I got base filet. Had to send my fish back it tasted and smelled really bad. Son could not eat his chicken fingers. Everything tasted stale.  Took the chicken home for the dogs they would not eat it either. Don't wast your time coming here.  Quality of the food and service are bad!!!  I would give it a no star rating if I could!"}
{"text":"Ate here once when it opened almost 3 years ago, was a horrible experience so I did not eat at any ESM since then. Recently decided to give them a try again since it had been a few years and they were running some great promos in the mail, so I tried to order dinner online. Key word being TRIED, from a store located 5 mins down the road from my house. Got the error message saying no ESM exists near my house. Errrmm...ya it does - 5 mins by car exactly according to Google maps. 10 mins by bicycle.

They could send someone on a bicycle to deliver my food if they wanted to. But alas, this muilt-billion dollar behemoth can't even get a simple website right, so I'm safe to assume the food is still gross and disgusting. Lots of other delivery options right down the street, do yourself and your family a favor and just order from there as these fools simply have not earned your business and will only disappoint should you mistakenly give it to them."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  The food is ok, but the service was terrible.  Granted, I don't speak much French, but I think that shouldn't completely change the attitude of the waiter.  Anyway, the entire time, we had to ask for refills of water and coffee.  Basic functions.  It wasn't even that packed.
To top it off, the waiter took 20 minutes to get my check.  I asked several times and he told me to wait.  When I complained to the manager, he finally got my check, and claimed that I had only been waiting for 5 minutes.  The manager sided with him and basically called me a liar. 

lol what?

Yeah, I'm not going here next time I visit."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Monday evening after visiting the Toronto Premium Outlets. Our server took forever to come to our table despite the restaurant only having 4 other occupied tables near us being served by other servers. He then proceeded to take forever to bring out appetizers and drinks. Food was mediocre compared to the other east side mario locations in the area and service was slow and not pleasant. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"East side Mario's, east side Mario's, eh bada boom bada FAIL! 

This place does one thing great. They are the cheapest, least authentic way to eat Italian. 

All you can eat salad and bread included with your meal. Does that say something to you? Sure does to me. Kids eat free? I wonder why. 

Being Italian and getting dragged here by friends, I got the least Italian thing on the menu to save my taste buds. The salmon with veggies. You'd think, how could they mess up a piece of fish right? Wrong. They did. My salmon came out still frozen in the centre and was FULL of bones. Inedible. Told the manager working, he replaced it. +1 star. 

The end. See you never again Mario!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat since it was in the neighborhood. Ordered the chicken parm which wasn't all that great. Just pretty much breaded chicken with sauce and pasta in the side. Sauce was bland and service was slow."}
{"text":"It will do in a pinch, guess it depends on who is pinching you. But I was looking for something to feed the 12 year old son while we were on our way to Paul McCartney's show at the ACC. We were staying at the hotel attached to the Rogers Centre (no free advertising, American chain) and were looking for something to nosh on prior to the overpriced concessions of the arena. Knowing that his 12 old palate specialized in the two main food groups (chicken fingers and fries) and he mentioned pizza, we set out and found this outlet which if nothing else spared my aging pallet of Pizza Pizza as well as had the good sense to have Sleeman's on tap. Was it anything special no, it was serviceable, got the job of foodlike stuff into us at a reasonable price, which we promptly spent on bootleg tshirts outside the ACC.

Win-win"}
{"text":"Went after work for quick bite and upon entering no host/hostess. Waited 5 mins & when someone finally came we were ignored.  Hostess a little lost, finally got to table, great waitress. I ordered the wrong 
thing...stay away from pepperonata steak and pasta.  Pasta was ok but steak was flavourless & very poor quality meat. Salad & bread great & calamari diabolo and old favourite.  Will not go for awhile."}
{"text":"I actually love East Side Mario's. I get cravings for their Scallop & Shrimp Spaghettini $18.99. Their Scallop Carbonara (three bacon-wrapped scallops $18.49) is absolutely delicious.

Both of them comes with garlic bread and a small cup of soup or salad.

It's pretty empty every time I came here... which is weekend lunch and late night dinners. The service was good, no complaints. 

There's a separate entrance for ordering takeouts. Orders for two usually takes about 10-15min, total of about $45+. Quite large portions (for me, small Asian girl), but it comes out super hot and satisfies all my late night cravings. Definitely expensive... yes, I agree. But bacon and scallops are just soooooo goooddd.."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly - usually end up chatting for a bit and having a few laughs. The service is a bit slow but if it's because they are being friendly with others, I don't mind. For those that got slow service because I chatted with wait staff - sorry!  Food is good - I find it consistent and reliable. I like to try something new each time and I'm never disappointed. It's kid friendly and also fun with friends. I love the bread and salad. Never disappointed here. I tend to not rave about chain restaurants - or at least ones that feel like a chain - and this does have that feel - but in spite of it, the wait staff at this location and the consistently good food allow me to say all good things. I didn't go 5 star because of the chain feeling. I know some people like that - the comfort of knowing they are all the same. I would love to see this location shake things up. Staff seems pretty cool - would love to see a cooler vibe in the place."}
{"text":"Came here with my kids now on numerous occasions... it is A-OK.  Great value.. 
Spent 5 bucks per kid... and that included drink.. meal.. and desert.  Plus it was my daughters birthday so they did the whole song and dance thing.  
I ordered a chicken parm sandwich.  The sandwich tasted great...it really did.  But the lower bun was a little cold like it had been in the fridge.  I had the waitress feel it for FYI, and she offered to take it back, but it was so good I told her not too.  
So, the bill came... she had taken off my sandwich the bill.  PLUS.. she explained that they were issuing me a 15 dollar gift certificate.  
Plus.. my daughter spun some sort of birthday meal, and received a free lunch coupon.  I felt bad after I left, as my bill was only about 16 dollars since I had had a beer.  But talk about customer service!!  I was impressed.  
I hadn't noticed at the time, but apparently it is a new menu.  
Plus it's always great for the kids.. it's a fun kids location.  
We recently stopped again for a quick beer.. and learned that they will be renovating the entire store soon.... extending the bar, more TVs, sports events, etc.  
So... liking the great customer service... kids always want to go there... and looking forward to seeing what kind of renovations will be done."}
{"text":"Came here for my gfs birthday dinner, it's her one of her favourite restaurants, but we decided to try a new location. 

We got shown to our seats pretty quickly, our waiter was very friendly and extremely attentive and accommodating, as I asked him about gluten free options and considering he said he was new, he came back with all the information quite quickly. Overall as a waiter, he's why I'm giving this location 3 stars, if we didn't have a good waiter, I'd give it one.

The food wasn't very good imo. My gf enjoyed hers though, she had the Cheese Cappelletti. I got the Linguine Chicken Tetrazzini (gluten free), it was passable. The sauce wasn't mixed through. So it was like they had cooked the pasta and spooned a small portion of sauce on top. So I ended up taking it home, adding butter, cream and mozzarella and made it delicious. For gluten free pasta, it was pretty great, in terms of texture.

Our starting salads were inconsistent, hers was overdressed and mine was way under, but we ended up switching because we liked the others salad. The Calamari was ok. The sauces were great (however when I took it home, he didn't pack the sauces :( which sucks. It wasn't super hot and not very crispy.

Overall, we had a good experience because the waiter was awesome. But I wouldn't go back on my own."}
{"text":"It's Friday Dinner and a Movie Date Night! This location is conveniently located in the same plaza as the Eglinton Town Centre Cinema so its a perfect fit!

It's a bit after 8pm and theres a 30 minute wait to get a seat in the dining room. I inquire about the bar side and the hostess alerts me that we can just on over and seat ourselves. It's also packed on this side, but luckily I spot the only vacant bar table in the very back corner.

We seat ourselves and await the arrival of our waiter. He comes on over and runs the menu by us and takes our drink order. I soon realize that our waiter who is also the bartender on this side is solely in charge of waiting all the tables over here. However he somehows manages it well never neglecting anyone.

After quickly perusing the menu (we have a little over one hour to dine before we have to depart to our movie) we are ready to order. Our waiter notices our closed menus and comes over to take our orders:

Both Entrees come with  all-you-can-eat soup or salad and garlic homeloaf. 

Garlic Homeloaf - Soft, warm, baugette brushed with garlic butter, beautifully presented, How can you flaw fresh baked bread?

Garden Salad - Mixed greens, grape tomatoes, pepperoncini peppers, red onions, black olives and croutons tossed in there famous house vinaigrette.

Caesar Salad - Romaine lettuce, bacon pieces and seasoned croutons tossed with creamy Caesar dressing.

Both salads are dressed well, fresh crisp greens, simple, basic salad, but good flavour.

Hell's Kitchen Chicken - Spicy chicken sautéed with mushrooms, fresh Roma tomatoes, spicy chilli peppers and our Arrabbiata tomato sauce. Served with fresh seasonal vegetables and spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce.
The chicken had a good kick too it! It was also served with a plump red hot pepper which increased the heat, if you dare to bite into it! Chicken was cooked well, I just wish it was a bigger portion of meat. Pasta came out steaming hot which I love and I enjoyed the plump mushrooms served on the chicken.

Small Pepperoni Pizza - The classic pepperoni pizza with a blend of cheeses and pizza sauce. 
Hot and crispy, gooey cheesey ... simple, basic, good and it really is small...

No time for dessert we ask our waiter to bring our bill over. He does so quickly because he knows were running over to the movies.

Overall simple, basic, tastey Italian food. If your looking for a meal close to the theatre this is your best bet, even without reservations we got through our meal fast enough to catch our movie. Prompt and friendly service despite the overly full and busy restaurant. Definitely make reservations if your planning to come here on a weekend or try your luck at the bar side for speedy service."}
{"text":"Came here late Sunday night for a Family Dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty with a few other families dining. The hostess greeted us and we were kindly taken to a booth table in the dining room.

Our waitor Joy was really nice and went over the specials for the day. He took our drink orders and told us to browse the menus and when we were ready to order just close all our menus and he'd be right over.

After sometime we were ready to order and closed our menus and Joy came over to take our order.

For appetizer we tried something off the Mariolicious Feature Menu:

Meatball Roll -Meatballs nestled in pizza sauce, pizza mozzarella and caramelized onions all rolled up in a pizza crust and baked to a golden brown. This was really good, almost like a baked meatball sub, its sliced in 6 pieces so its perfect for sharing!

Next came the All You Can Eat Soup, Salads, and Garlic Home Loaf that comes with the order of any Entree. Our Waitor brought us out a big bowl of the garden salad, caesar salad, and 2 garlic loafs, and an italian wedding soup which is my brother's favourite.

I had the Garden Salad which has mixed greens, grape tomatoes, pepperoncini peppers, red onions, black olives, and croutons in there house dressing. Its a simple salad but I enjoyed the pepperoncini peppers in it.

I love the Garlic Homeload which is simply a warm fresh baked baguette brushed with garlic butter.

For mains the table orders included Spaghetti and Meatballs, Hells Kitchen Chicken, and Chicken Marsala.

I got the Spaghetti Bolognese - my only complaint was I thought the meat sauce was a little lacking, my spaghtetti could of used more sauce and more meat. 
Otherwise no complaints on the mains, portion sizes were really good.

Then onto dessert. Lots of good options. As soon as I saw the menu I knew what I had to have and I definitely recommened this to other peanut butter chocolate lovers like myself:

Peanut Butter Stack - Layers of peanut butter, rich milk chocolate cake, and honey roasted peanuts. I asked to hold the carmel sauce as I hate carmel sauce. This was soo delicious!! A must try! I loved the little crunchy bits from the peanuts.

My brother ordered the Double Chocolate Explosion Cake -
Moist devil's food cake with creamy chocolate mousse
studded with caramel cheesecake chunks, chocolate shavings,
toasted almonds and thick chocolate drizzle! He couldn't finish it all, so lucky me I got to indulge, This is very rich but perfect for a chocolate lover! I enjoyed the combination of chocolate mousse and cheesecake. Yummy all around!

My parents got the Mario's Funnel Cake-  Crisp fried funnel cake topped with a light cinnamon sugar,vanilla ice cream and strawberry sauce, they asked to hold the carmel sauce also. They thoroughly enjoyed this! It was very big and they could not finish it all.

Our waiter was really attentive, clearing tables refilling our drinks, bringing us more hot water for our teas, and additional cups of coffee and garlic bread.

Overall good meal, very filling, great friendly service, definitely try to save room for dessert if you can!"}
{"text":"The food was so bland, tried it twice and it was literally the same bland food each time (Alfredo) salad and bread is okay however but not redeeming enough"}
{"text":"This place ruined my night. I should have known better ordering a streak from a cheap Italian restaurant. The minestrone soup tasted like it was for sure out of a can and it was Luke warm. I also had the house salad which was \"ok\" but didn't taste that fresh. Onto the steak which was the \"Tuesday's special\" was cooked to my desired liking (medium) but was tasteless and 1/4 of it was fat. The service wasn't that great either(lacking ambition and motivation and customer service, didn't seem to wanna be there and was walking around looking at cell phone ) and we had the assistant manager/supervisor. We also had dirty cutlery. Some positives... the food came fast, and it was a pretty decent atmosphere, we sat in the dining room not lounge. They also knocked a portion off the bill for shitty experience.

So after my review of this restaurant the owner emailed me, then we had brief contact on the phone. Needless to say he was very unprofessional and didn't seem to care one bit that his staff walk around on cell phones and serve shit food from a frozen bag, we will NEVER be back and do not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE. I wouldn't feed this garbage to my dog"}
