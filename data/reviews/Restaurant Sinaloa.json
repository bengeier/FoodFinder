{"text":"If you're not Hispanic or look Hispanic you might turn some heads going into this place. Speaking or at least understanding Spanish would also be a plus as the menu is mostly in Spanish with a little English to help out the Anglos a bit. 

They have a juke box with Mexican music that was playing very loud , so loud that I was tempted to leave when I first walked in but I'm glad I stayed. 

Very authentic Mexican food and the portions are huge. Service was fast and friendly even after the waitress found out I don't speak Spanish?"}
{"text":"El Sinaloa is one of the best places to get mariscos in the valley.
I have to warn you though that the place is very loud. There will be loud music and even louder people. 
I love it!"}
{"text":"4 Stars until I eat more there! 
this place is legit as it gets! Fish Taco, Pollo, Smoked Marlin, Steak! Everything was AWESOME!!!! 
And as stated before, I am not going long-winded on this one. If you like Legit Mexican Food......Go here now!!!!!!!!

{"text":"I considered myself a loyal Sinaloa customer since at least 2007.  
We average 3x visits a month plus special occiasions, etc.  
I have introduced dozens of people (from friends, family, and co-workers).
I rarely eat alone and almost always have 2-3 friends with me.
The servers know what I order before I say hello.

So why do I plan on never going back, and why the one star after all these years?
Was the food particularily bad that day? No.
Were the servers at fault? No, they are always great.

I wish it was something as benign as the above, since anyone can have an off day.

Ultimately I feel a sense a betrayal by being treated like a 2nd class citizen after years of loyal patronage.

Is it a small thing in the grand scheme of things, of course.  Most things are.

It is Tuesday May 11, 2016 - we decide to stop by after work.
Place is busy so we stand in line for our table. 
We wait ~20 minutes. 
People in front of us are seated.
Now we are the only ones in line.
Then a group of 3 customers come in behind us.
To our surprise, they are seated ahead of us.
Of course we were confused and I talked to the manager.
He said they were there before us.

It did not seem reasonable to believe that Sinaloa holds your place in line and you can leave and come back after 30 minutes.

This could very well have been a simple misunderstanding - but the manager did absolutely nothing to clear anything up.

How could the manager have handled that better?
1) Could have just asked us.  
\"Excuse me, would you mind if these 3 were seated before you? They are elderly - They are the boss' friends - They are our regulars\"
Being asked would have changed everything.

2) After seeing that a customer got a bad perception or even the wrong perception, the least the manager could have done is apologize.  
An apology would have changed everything.

The manager made us feel like a bunch of doofuses - you are going to treat me like a 2nd class citizen, then expect me to spend $60 and thank you for it?  No.  We were disrespected and that is unacceptable to us.

Ok - so we walked out and plan to never return.

Searching for 'Mexican Seafood' yields many good results."}
{"text":"Seafood rocked! Good portions, service, and fast delivery. If loud music is not your thing, you won't like this place. I found it fun and mood lifting."}
{"text":"I ordered two tostadas (one shrimp and one scallop) and a water. Bill was $17.35. Maybe I'm biased because these things are 20 pesos a piece in mexico, but I was floored with the price. Service was also terrible. For what it's worth, the tostadas were pretty good, but I'll go to another mariscos place with normal prices ($3.99-5.99 each). 

In my life I've literally never not tipped. This was the first time and just says how ripped off i felt."}
{"text":"Our family frequently visits this location, we never had any issues before our last dining expirence. We ordered the deluxe oysters, served with shrimp; hindsight shrimp should be consumed only when thouroughly cooked. One hospital visit later, benadryl and antibiotics we now know not to order this dish again."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite seafood place, hands down. Fresh. Good portions. Ranchera playing. As authentic as it gets. Do not let the location fool you.

Seafood is my thing. I love it endlessly. When it comes to the seafood, I have yet to find a boring dish. I order the mojarra frita or al mojo de ajo (-whole- tilapia fried or slathered in crushed garlic), though I usually favor the huachinango (whole red snapper) because when it comes to the bones it is naturally easier to eat. No fault of the restaurant. Note: When I say whole, I mean the whole thing. Head, fins, tail~ gutted and de-scaled of course. Delicious! 

Never ever forget the corn tortillas and lime wedges!

I also order the osteones especiales...special oysters. They come raw with scallop, shrimp, jalapeno, and avocado in each half shell, marinated in lime juice and topped with red onion. I love these so much, I can finish at least a dozen by myself. The ceviche is amazing as well. I treated my parents to these when they came to visit from California and my father said that his favorite place of 10+ years for mojarra in Cali did could not compare at all to Restaurant Sinaloa. Sorry, dad! This is a definite must when they visit now.

Service was shaky at our last visit as the waitress was not as attentive as I would have preferred, but that's okay. I still left severely satisfied with a large horchata to-go. We have been coming here for years and I will return over and over."}
{"text":"Food was great, the grilled pork is fantastic. Oysters, octopus, shrimp is wonderful. Would have received more stars but the jukebox music is extremely way too loud. It drowns out any conversations you may have with your party. I'm sure there is a volume level but they don't seem to want to change it to a nice easy listening level."}
{"text":"If you like authentic mexican seafood - than this is the place. The seafood tastes fresh, I haven't had anything I did not like. The food is really good, definitely a place I recommend.

However, the area is questionable - I've never had an issue, but you do get an uneasy feeling. Also, the service is not great, this might be because the place is always so busy - it seems like your waiter/waitress is running all over the place. Definitely be  prepared to wait for a table on the weekends, sometimes for 30 minutes +"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best restaurant in town but lately the service takes forever and it seems like the food is not as good as it used to I mean if you want to go make sure you have enough time to wait for your food to be ready because it will take a while but I mean not the best but not the worst in town"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants!  We went last night and had an amazing meal with friends.  It's so authentic that you will want to bring a friend who speaks spanish along with you.  But you can get by with only english and so don't let that stop you from going.

The atmosphere is kinda divey, but still pleasant.  Beautiful, colorful murals on the walls and loud mexican music.  There were mexican soap operas playing on the TVs....not what I wanted to watch, but I am not their avg client!

I had the fillete de chef and it was PHENOMENAL!  baked fish (flounder? it was so buttery and smooth) topped with octupus (perfectly cooked) and shrimp (slightly tough) in a wonderful, light-tasting cream sauce with bacon in it.  Wow, I just loved it.  Had leftovers for lunch today and it was great.  

My husband had the shrimp bacanora (sp?) and it was divine.  A wonderful cream sauce with Bacanora (an agave liquor).  Highly recommended.

My other friends had shrimp in green chile cream sauce (excellent!) and a whole, deep-friend red snapper that was good but a little on the dry side.  For appetizers we had ceviche tostada (excellent!) and the little peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon and bathed in a salty soy sauce (very good!!). 

I highly recommend this place.  I can't wait to go back!

{"text":"took 5min to get us seated, there was 3 different girls who were our \"server\" then our food came out 30min later. The carne asada was burnt on the bottom and it appeared as if they hid it under the rice and beans so we would not notice it. Grilled shrimp we ordered was burnt as well...ordered a Seafood trio and a majority of it was rice. and once we were done with our food our \"server\" was no where to be seen and our check never came  to the table. crap service. just because you guys are busy does not mean you have to provide bad service..."}
{"text":"ok, the area was a little scary, but I heard the food was good.  Well, it was authentic mexico, and not in a good way.  The service was poor and some of the food came out wrong and they did not care.  The food mosty tasted good...  The place needed a good cleaning as well.  Found much better places to be for this type of food here in Mesa...places where they actually care about the customer!  I think one of the best palces used to be one of these, but sold and cleaned up....I go there..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I'm from Sinaloa Mexico! I would add more stars but the service was not too good. It does help if you know a bit of Spanish but the menu does come in English. The shrimp ceviche is awesome and one tostada can be shared. The fish filet in garlic sauce is huge and really tasty."}

{"text":"They have recently introduced their new menu with new additions. Very delicious, my husband now has a new dish!"}
{"text":"Best Seafood Mexican food in all AZ!!!! Love love this place!!!! Try the Toritos!!! Omg Soo good"}
{"text":"Bad service, OK food. Mexican rice is from a box; waitress didn't even smile; restaurant is dirty; menus are falling apart; complimentary chips & \"salsa\" is the shrimp cocktail stuff (not salsa). Order was wrong \"No pico\" was interpreted as \"let's jam pack this burrito with pico.\" *Oysters are good though. This place has gone downhill my friends."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of sea food, but this place is a must. I call it \"the best spot to recover from a hang over\", no kidding. This was my 3rd time and I was as pleased as the last 2. 

Try the toritos (peppers filled with shrimp and wrapped in bacon, on a soy-like sauce). Three of those plus a \"michelada\" (beer with lime juice, clamato and salt) and you'll be better than with an IV. You can also try the shrimp broth, it takes you back from the grave (the booze grave).

The shrimp cocktail is great, with fresh cucumber. Pour some lime juice and ask for ketchup and you'll be thrilled. 

My brother had the shrimp wrapped in bacon, there were pretty good.

The service was pretty good and friendly. Actually I went there with a friend who has several restaurants and restaurant experience and he pointed out that the service was better than average. 

One note. If you're white supremasist, a mexican hater, kkk, confederated, Arpaio lover and so on, this might not be your place. Most of the patrons are hispanic and also all the waitresses. 

I almost forgot it, they play \"banda\" music which I find hideous but the food worth the music pain, specially if you're hung over.

This is as close as you can get to the real mexican seafood restaurant that could be found in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Ixtapa, etc."}
{"text":"Received the wrong order, slacked on checking on us. Didn't get one refill the whole time I was there, waiter kept passing by and only acknowledged the guys sitting across us. She acted fake once we went up for the receipts just to get a good tip."}
{"text":"Nasty RESTROOMS! a real Mexican neighborhood type eating place.
Prices a bit on the high side but the food is better than average so i would say it is worth it.
nothing fancy, just bare-bones dining. good food though, lots of seafood.wish there were more grilled/roasted food.............cuz they got way too much FRIED food and as every one knows FRIED food aint healthy."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!!!! The waitress acted like she didn't care for our business and made the entire experience horrible!! It was like it was a bother to her if we asked for anything! I am normally a really chill person since I used to be a waitress but this was terrible! The food is good but I wouldn't go back just because of the service!!!"}
{"text":"The food is not that good!!! It is really expensive and was not worth it, I didn't even eat my food ...save ur money and time and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I had THE WORST green aguachiles here. It was literally raw shrimp, lemon juice and a bit of the green salsa. Wish I would've taken a picture. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Civiche that tastes like canned tomato juice and over cooked shrimp do not belong in a Mexican seafood restaurant. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Buenisiiiimaaa comidaaaa!!!!
Todo lo que he comido esta en sabor de primera calidad, las meseras muy amables.
Tostadas ceviche de camaron y los caldos son mis favoritos."}
{"text":"Have been here before but this time the place gets a star due to the fact that my food came cold! How did they rectify,  they took it back and it looks like they just torched it,  whatever they did made the food dry, I couldn't eat it.  Manager never came and food isn't cheap to get such lots grade food.  Sorry,  won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Sorry about the length but thought all was pertinent for an accurate review.

GREAT FRESH MEXICAN SEAFOOD!! We got a tip from my husbands coworker to try this place out. We went the same day because we were very excited to try some fresh seafood. It is in a location that could make some get a little uneasy... I will explain.
We walked in & immediately saw that EVERYONE had a large abundance of shrimp on their plates in all different styles. One of the waitresses signaled for us to find a seat. They brought chips & salsa as soon as we sat down. We started off with drinks... my husband had the margarita which was large & tasty, and I had a pina colada which was good. When we looked over the menu we wanted to order everything! They had pictures & it all looked delicious! He ordered a fish plate with rice & salad. It was a large piece of flounder covered with a cream sauce filled with shrimp & octopus... Wow! Very good! I decided on the shrimp salad with avocado. I have this thing with wanting my salads chopped for easier eating & I was happy to see it came chopped!! except the shrimp of course - those were whole, fresh & cooked perfectly. It had what seemed like an endless amount of avocado - impressive! I also got a fish taco a la carte - it was deep fried (all right by me) and then they give you your own squeeze bottles full of sauces to top it off yourself which I thought was ideal. It was all great!
Did I mention our food came out lightening fast? It was only a matter of minutes- less than 5 for sure!

I don't want to sugar coat the atmosphere... there was a guy who came in to get some relief from the hot concrete he apparently called home. There was a nice patron who bought him a beer & maybe some food - didn't stick around long enough to see that- but that patrons brother got up to stop him because he said the restaurant didn't want him there! It caused a minor scene, but the brother did not win... the guy sat drinking his cold beer - that made us feel good to know there were good people willing to step out & do a good deed!! The situation didn't really bother us at all. Then there was a young (young!) boy who came in that was peddling for money & who you could tell was sadly hooked on serious drugs. He did score a small donation before he was asked to leave & did so without incident. My husband wanted to kidnap him & get him some help because he was very young & it was a hard truth to ignore, but we ended up just hoping the best for him. Very sad. Bottom line- those were minor occurrences in a room full of ordinary people.
That is my story about my trip to Restaurant Sinaloa! All in all, we left there saying we can't wait to return!!! This place is about food & if you can overlook the location & some peoples battle with life, it is a must try!"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. Nice to find somewhere that knows how to cook fish.  Chips and salsa are the only item that I'm not a fan of....but you don't go to a seafood place for chips and salsa so it's irrelevant.  Soups are fresh and we'll prepared with a fresh plate of add ins everytime.  Fresh oysters with a nice surprise...shrimp, fish,onion,avocado on top.....yum.  Love all the different ways they prepare the shrimp and fish. If you have ever been down to baja Mexico, Puerto Penasco, Keno Bay, etc...this place will bring back those memories. This place is the real deal with great food and friendly staff....plain and simple."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years. Their Culichi is the best I have had. The battered fish tacos are very good too.  Today as I stood at the register waiting for someone to seat me. I could hear two women talking behind the counter to the left, too busy to seat me, no biggy this isn't Red Lobster. I could see one cook preparing food as his back was to me cutting something. Another guy in the kitchen area opposite him was facing me. As he stuck his thumb in his nose to dig around I about shit myself. This was not a rub a tickle away. This was a 5 second dig. This guy was working in the kitchen! with an apron on.  I was sceebed out of my mind. I will eat food off the floor but a food preparer to pick their nose, no way.  It wasn't just the gross factor but as I drove to my next choice for dinner I became enraged. I reaaaally loved their shrimp Culichi. What I saw will keep me from ever risking eating here again. I know this may happen but this guy didn't even care that I was standing there. Sorry Sinaloa, you need to look into hiring people that care. If management reads this it was 6/13/13 at apx 5:15pm.


Update...3/11/15. I was in Mesa and tried their other location a week earlier. Marlin tacos were great but Mesa is too far for me. A week later I had to give the Phoenix location another chance. I was glad to see the people in the kitchen were wearing gloves now, thanks management.  I will keep coming to this location."}
{"text":"Sinaloa does not look like much from the outside. Well, lets be honest, it doesn't look like much from the inside either.  That is okay, in this town, that is usually a good sign that you are about to have a killer meal.  That thinking did not fail to prove true, Sinaloa is fantastic.

When I ask my friends which Mexican seafood restaurants they like around town, I usually get this return glare that says \"are you being serious?\"  Yes folks, the Hispanic community can cook(or crudo) seafood the same as the rest of the world and it is good.  

I usually get the cold squid appetizer.  It is a salad of squid, lettuce, spices and it just delicious. I have never ordered this and left any on the plate. This dish has converted more than a few people to the treasure of Mexican seafood.  My dad loves the filete de chef, which is a large fillet of fish cooked with the chefs special sauce on a bed of rice.  I love the seafood stew which is always filled with goodies like fish, shrimp and squid.  

Do not expect the bill to be cheap if you eat like I do, but certainly reasonable for the quality and quantity you are offered.  Four stars for this restaurant, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I will stick to Don Camarones, this place was decent, the service was good but the pulpa was overdone and too chewy and the shrimp was too fishy, like it wasn't even close to fresh. HOWEVER, the yellow peppers wrapped in bacon and doused in soy sauce were the shit! The Michelada was warm and basically all clamato. So, it's your basic Camarones dive. Probably won't go back, and I don't like saying this at all bc the service was good for sure."}
{"text":"Went based on reviews. It does look divey on the outside but sometimes the best restaurants do. Walked in and wasnt greeted, shuffled around the dining room for awhile looking for a booth to sit in not covered in crumbs. A lady working in the dining room called for a waitress to come out to me. She brought chips and salsa and was nice enough. I asked for a water which came out shortly. I ordered a beer and said I needed another minute with the menu. I guess there was my mistake. At least 10 minutes later my beer and server had never materialized again.  There were only 2 other people in the restaurant. I left a dollar for the chips and salsa i ate while waiting for my waitress to return and walked out. I passed a couple employees behind the counter talking happily. Shame, the cordon bleu shrimp and smoked marlin quesadillas sounded really damn good."}
{"text":"Just had a supplier bring us lunch today from here...some of the freshest seafood authentic mexican dishes you can get...4 locations throughout the valley...haven't been inside but our supplier says it's just like you were in Mexico..little hole in the wall and people coming in trying to sell you stuff like wallets, buckles and more...will definetly try to dine in some time in the near future...loved it.."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  I haven't had fresh Mexican seafood sence I was last in Mexico.  Very authentic.  This is obviously a locals place but we were welcomed like locals.  If you want real ceviche...This the place."}
{"text":"Restaurant Sinaloa is my little seaside Mexican vacation. Soon as I walk in the door, I'm literally transported. TV's playing the Spanish channel. Juke Box blaring Hispanic music at party volume.  All the signage is in Spanish. The bilingual \"small print\" on the menu is English! And the seafood is fresh from the gulf of Baja! Shrimp cocktails in big glass goblets of lime juice. Options to the shrimp, if you are adventuresome, include Scallops, oysters and octopus. On the table there are six different brands of hot sauce so you can doctor-up to your content. I like the shrimp burrito. Grilled shrimp, green peppers and onions, with soupy refried beans in a fresh flour tortilla. I'm a bit of a tortilla snob. They serve the real-deal, handmade flour tortillas here. I am always surprised that notable Mexican restaurants, opt for the preservative stenched, shelf life tortillas. Then there is the shrimp soup.... It's a must try. I've yet to introduce anyone to the shrimp soup, whom did not respond with, OMG! The soup is broth style, from a fish stock reduction, and loaded with shrimp and served with a side of fresh chopped cilantro, oinions and more flour (or corn) tortillas!
    Let me predispose you please, to NOT, expect a whole, proper,  trained staff, dining experience.  That expectation would most likely disappoint you, and distract you, from enjoying the unique ethnic food prepaired."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ambiance of blaring music and Mexican soap operas on tv is awesome. The food was shockingly fresh for being in the middle of Arizona.  Couldn't be more authentic even if you were in Mazatlan. I had seafood served in a hollowed out young coconut. Not only delicious but the presentation was beautiful. It could have come out of one of Jean-George's kitchens in NYC. No Joke. That was the last thing I was expecting when I pulled up to this kinda run down little strip mall. Go. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This food is straight up taste less, idk what style of seafood this is but it is not very appetizing..food here is boring, i find the plates more amusing to see while eating, and maybe choking since the service here is so slow, it does get busy on the weekends which is understandable but having to be a small restaurant I'am sure they can check up on every cust real quick. the time to cook is ridiculous seeing others arriving later than you and receiving their food a lot sooner is really frustrating to see. Now maybe this attracts the type that grew up to this boring style of seafood, but never again will i ever waste time and money for sea...actually LAKE FOOD

note: oysters here are farm raised not from the ocean...they will admit to that ;)"}
{"text":"Really good for your money the ceviche tostadas are big and 2 will get you full! And the bacon wrapped jalapenos are delicious, so are the chelada's!!!!100%"}

The was is so so so bad 
I ordered a Carne burrito and I got %80 beans %10 vegetable %5 sauce and the rest meat 
The service took too long for empty place 
They prices are ok not to expansive 
But god the food is awful 
I think this place is not Mexican and not American 
Maybe it's good for little kids but not for me 
Stay away"}
{"text":"I don't get out to the eat valley too often so it was nice to try something completely different. Though not a fan of seafood they offer many other items to please the picky eaters like me. You get a real taste of the culture here. Your greeted with an \"HOLA\" as soon as you walk through the door. Spanish style music blaring off and on from the juke box. The staff is welcoming and attentive as the two minute rule applies here. I had my drink order and chips/salsa as soon as I sat down. The chips were served warm with a mild salsa and a bowl of half cut limes. I was impressed with that. They don't offer specials but have a nicely priced menu. 

My table had drinks, carna asada tacos, flour tortillas, beans, rice and guacamole. Everything is great. Our food was cooked and served fast. Our food overall taste really good."}
{"text":"One must overcome the look of the neighborhood and it's neighbor \"soup kitchen\". I used to volunteer at this \"soup kitchen\"  and the street people are not a danger to this neighborhood.  The restaurant is a large and open room with about 10 booths and 20 tables, an aquarium and loud loud Mexican music!  Did I mention it is loud?  Five or six waitresses, friendly, helpful and patient rush about serving the quests.  A Friday early evening, my wife and I were the only non latinos in the place.  The food was as beautiful as it was excellent.  We ordered shrimp quesadillas (9.99) and a deep fried whole red snapper in garlic sauce (13.99) both excellent. The portions were huge!!  The snapper was 12 to 14 inches long!  I have taken off one star for the overly loud music.  The bathroom and restaurant were clean and service was good.  We will surely return! Perhaps with ear plugs :)"}
{"text":"As a family we frequent this restaurant quite often since it opened....many many years ago IT IS AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD.  We luv it and when asked what is our favorite mexican restaurant to refer people there.  Mind you it is not fancy at all.

Luv the personal service and the food is amazing."}

{"text":"It's been awhile since me and my husband have been here, We ordered our food got our drinks it very quickly Took about 25 minutes to get our food my husband ordered the shrimp cocktail, I ordered the octopus and garlic butter the shrimp cocktail shrimp were overcooked soggy and had no flavor, My octopus plate was very tough the rice was cold beans were cold and the potatoes that came with it were also cold not satisfied with today's dinner, overall I will never come here and eat again."}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for lunch. When we walked in there were only 2 tables  with parties of about 6 or 8 and 2 tables of 2. Seemed like that they had already been served their meal. It took a long time for us to receive our meal. While we were waiting the restaurant filled up. A couple of times we waited quite a while for our iced teas to be refilled. I ordered the Molcajetes. My octopus was charred. I had a bite but it made me gag. However, I did like everything else that was served in the bowl. Just make sure you have something cold to drink because it is very spicy hot. The refried beans were excellent. Not sure if we will come back. Average experience."}
{"text":"I don't like this place! Bad service  I paid $ 40 for 3 mojarras and they were over done after I told them how I wanted them. I don't recommend these place."}
{"text":"You know that combined feeling of excitement and anticipation you get when you walk into a restaurant and it's as if you've stepped into someone else's country?  Each time I walk into Sinaloa, I feel like I've been transported into a small beach side neighborhood in Mexico.  Although I feel out of place, I'm ecstatic because I'm about to eat some of the best pacifico style seafood in the Valley.  One of my favorite dishes is the Chiccarron de Pargo.  A botana plate of lightly breaded pargo fish (pacific red snapper) that is served on top of a delicious salad that includes poached shrimp, avacados and orange slices.  The \"cherry on top\" of this dish are the 2 large bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with a cream cheese and shrimp known as \"Toritos\" which are also available on the menu as an appetizer on it's own.  Oh did I mention there's also a full bar!  If you're not a fan of loud jukebox playing \"ba bam bam ba bam bam\" ranchero music consider ordering your food to go, which I did just a few hours ago."}
{"text":"last week we stopped by to eat here, husband was in the mood for aguachiles. We had been here once before a long time ago. If you don't mind the long wait, then step right in. The waitress that helped us took forever to make an appearance, and when she did stop by to take our orders, she didn't write it down... i mention this because we ordered to-go, and when i got home i realized part of my order was incorrect, before submitting my order, she double checked our orders for correction, then i had to mention to her again the specifics of my order... please write down order. I don't have allergies to particular foods but if i did, and my order being incorrect would be of a great deal. Once our to-go order was submitted, it took a good while for it to be ready... that's fine though, its a busy restaurant and i don't expect speed unless its a fast food joint. My husband ordered aguachiles and i ordered the shrimp in chipotle sauce. On the menu, the chipotle shrimp has a flame logo indicating that its spicy... its not! but, i can assure you its super delicious! i was impressed with the flavor and portion of the plate! for a $16 dollar plate, i don't regret it. My husbands plate was also generously served, and the to-go order was filled with a more than perfect amount of condiments, napkins and sides for our dishes. No complaint there! The dishes are more on the pricy side, but aren't most sea food restaurants?  over all, waitress needs to write orders down for accuracy, be ready for longer wait times and have your wallet prepared. Good food! will most likely return whenever i can afford it again!"}

Mother of God, I regimen this  place  for  the  taste and  quality of  food"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant numerous times and I strongly recommend it! I love the ceviche and shrimp cocktails, both are absolutely EXCELLENT! If you are looking for a great lunch spot, it's a must!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I were actually trying to go to the Sonoran Hot Dog truck across the street, but it was not there and saw Sinaloa and decided to give it a try.  We were both pleasantly surprised at how good everything was.  Probably the best carne asada I have had in quite a while.  The tacos were great, my roommate also tried the ceviche and it was delicious as well.  The other tacos we tried were chicken and a shredded beef, both were very good as well, but were overshadowed by how awesome the carne asada was.  I knocked a star off because of the straight outta the bag chips, with so so salsa and the fact that every time I go there there's a communication struggle with the mostly Spanish speaking staff.  Overall, worth a trip."}
{"text":"We wish we read reviews before coming to this place. It is bad! I had the beef burrito and it was awful. Yes the beef was shredded but it was tough and flavorless! Hey folks! You're a Mexican restaurant and your supposed to use spices! I had to smother it with salsa to be able to choke this down. As it was I only ate half of it! My husband had a chicken burrito and again the meat was flavorless plus each piece of meat came with a serving of either chicken fat (gross) or gristle (double yuck!). Plus for two burritos and two glasses of water our bill was $19.53 before a tip! This place is way overpriced and I think the 5 star reviews must be from wait staff and family members. So don't waste your time or money coming to this sorry excuse for a Mexican restaurant. Find the closest Filiabertos instead! The only reason we give this place two stars instead of one is the waitress did a nice job."}
{"text":"Me and my family go here all the time.  It is authentic Mexican Seafood for sure.  I've had several different items and all are great.  Sometimes the service is a little slow (depends on which waitress you get and how busy they are) but the food makes up for it.  
Don't worry about not speaking english, go enjoy and you won't regret it.
Yes the music is loud and it's always super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.  If your not from this part of Mesa yes you would think the neighborhood bad but we have never had a problem.
Again the food makes up for it all!"}
{"text":"Street sign kust says Mariscos. Low key place with good prices and excellent food. Wait staff was very friendly. Had a couple of the tacos, they are bigger than street tacos. Smoked marlin... yum. First time here but I will be back."}
{"text":"I searched on Yelp for Seafood and this place came up with great reviews so we decided to try it.  Besides, I love Mexican and my husband loves Seafood so we were excited to try it and get the best of both worlds.  I wish I had the opportunity to review their food, but we never received what we ordered.  Their service is HORRIBLE.  My hubby and I went here on a Saturday night and yes, the place was crowded.  But when you see others arriving later than you and getting their orders before you = not right!  I ordered a simple taco and enchilada and my better half ordered the fried, whole tilapia.  We waited over 45 minutes and yet nothing came.  And the waitress only came by once during this time to ask us my husband if he wanted another beer.  No, we want our FOOD!  Completely ridiculous!  Now, I'm not one to play the prejudice card but I can't help but wonder if this was because we were practically the only non-hispanic people in the place.  Since the waitress never came by again, we had to go up to the counter and ask for our check to pay for the drinks and leave.  They even tried to charge us for the entire meal we didn't even get and were surprised that we refused to pay for it!  What?!?!  They never commented at all why our food never came out.  If you are not hispanic, save yourself from bad service and stay clear away from this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurant, I just love this place. I love their breaded fish tacos combination, it's to die for, I seriously love it. My husband and I almost always get the same thing, it is just delicious. Their Carne ASAda burritos, nachos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are really good too."}
{"text":"Worst place for mariscos. Food wasn't  good at all; extremely bland and Service was terrible. We stood there for a good 3-5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The waitresses passed us by and just looked at us without saying a thing while we stood there waiting to be seated. We asked for drinks along with glasses of water and when the bill was given to us we discovered we were charged $3 for the water. This place always looks busy and I don't understand why. Phoenix needs more GOOD mariscos restaurants!"}
{"text":"\"This place is scratching an itch that I didn't even know I had!\"

Those were my first words when our food came out. This is a restaurant specializing in mariscos, which is something that you're probably not overly familiar with. Too many people think of Mexican food as just tacos and burritos, but you truly owe it to yourself to experience the amazing meals that you can have at a restaurant like this. 

We ordered three things- Molcajete Barbaroja, Fried whole fish, and Oysters on the half shell. Also a glass of horchata, and some water. So there ya go.

The Molcajete was amazing. I had NO idea how much I had been craving a dish like this, but now I have a new favorite. The octopus was grilled PERFECTLY, with just a hint of char and an amazingly soft-yet-chewy texture. It's one of those things that you just can't really describe- you just have to have it and fall in love with it. A piece of skirt steak was also in the mix, and it was just incredible. You pull it apart with your fingers, sop it with a tortilla, hit it with a squeeze of lime and hot sauce, then you're all set. 

The fried fish was fried perfectly, which isn't as easy as it sounds. It's common with these sorts of dishes to overcook them, even with good intentions. This fish was perfectly juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The meat was delicious, and the beans and rice which came with it were amazing. It's remarkable how good beans and rice can actually be, but it also sort of sucks because you know that once you have the really good stuff, you won't be able to go back to the bootleg shit that you grew up eating.

And now, a word about the oysters on the half-shell. This is another case in which Mexican cuisine FAR outstrips what we poor gringos are used to (see Shrimp Cocktail as well). Their version of oysters on the half shell involves slices of raw shrimp, scallops, red onions, and fresh avocados. It's basically a mini-ceviche on an oyster shell, and once you've had it you won't be able to go back to oysters with watery cocktail sauce and horseradish.

In short, this place is a jewel. The menu is all in Spanish with a little bit of English, but there are more than enough pictures to give you an idea of what you might like to order. People have remarked about this being in a 'sketchy' area, but that's just the price that you pay for authentic food. I wouldn't recommend walking five blocks south, but unless you're up to no good you wouldn't have any reason to do that anyways. :)"}
{"text":"Table was wobbly ok, garlic shrimp was chewy or rubbery bacon was salty but atmosphere was nice. Change the channel. Watching Drug banditos get taken down by the police doesn't exactly go with my dinner!"}
{"text":"You can always tell a good restaurant by the crowds the place draws. And there is always a crowd here all the way until closing time!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not all that good either. Had the seafood platter and most everything way over cooked, spiceless and rubbery. The place wasn't all that busy at 5 pm, so can't blame it on that. Will try elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"What a shame. I returned after two years and knew something was wrong.  The place was dirty,
 the service was terrible, the food was bad and prices had gone up.
 This could not be because of a one time bad night .I won't return."}
{"text":"I was really shocked about this place on how amazing it was. I was told by a friend about this place and my love for authentic Mexican food I had to go. Even though it looks bad from the outside and the decor on the inside is not good either the food is top notch and is one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food on earth! Must try for everyone that wants authentic Mexican food. Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  I love mexican seafood and this place does it great.  You will not be disappointed with your food.  Parking sucks here and be prepared for a wait to sit.  But don't let that or the decor scare you off.  Get a shrimp cocktal to start and you will feel much better about everything."}
{"text":"This place is good for oysters, they're fresh and for a reasonable price. Service is ok, the young waitress is the best, very attent and always with a smile."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mariscos (Mexican seafood) places in the valley. Fish was all very fresh and delicious. We tried many things on the menu and everything has turned out very good. Prices are very reasonable. If you're ever questioning whether you should go in- stop your car and go and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tostada de ceviche and coctel de camaron are both great. Service was very fast and they brought more chips without asking, which was great. Definitively coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious Cerviche! I've lived down the road from this place almost 5 months and finally stopped tonight. I did take out just for me. I'm originally from New England and seafood is my favorite and obviously pretty sparse here in Arizona. I saw \"fresh seafood\" out front and hoped for some cerviche. It was indeed fresh! I got the shrimp and octopus mix. Also got an order of guacamole which was very good too! I will be returning."}
{"text":"Went to Restaurant Sinaloa with my wife today.  Usually this is the kind of place we would drive right past and not pay attention to.  We did this many times for this restaurant.  Well today we went to this place for dinner.

My wife ordered the arroz marinero (seafood rice).  I ordered the coconut shell cocktail of shrimp, oysters, and octopus.  Both were very good.  My wife and I were impressed.  We will definitely return here.  

Do not let the outside of the building or the neighborhood put you off.  This is a place that we want to do well and stay in business.

------------

I want to update my review.  My wife and I have been here a couple of times.  My father, from Illinois, a snow bird, says the place is pretty good.  He was surprised by the high quality of the shrimp. The only thing he mentioned that they may want to change is turn down the volume on the music. 

My mother, on the other hand, had her issues with the place being too casual.  It was not her \"cup of tea\"."}
{"text":"This is my only 1 star rating since using Yelp. We waited 20 mins to be seated that was no big deal. After we were seated we noticed that 3 families that came in after us were seated and had drinks and chips at their tables We had not even been greeted. Waitresses avoided our table handed out checks refilled glasses to other customers. I have never felt so disrespected."}
{"text":"I felt like I was actually in Mexico when I was there. The chips and salsa were great, very fresh, tasty and probably made there. I had the smoked Marlin tacos and my husband had the carne asada tacos both large portions and very good. The Margaritas could have used a little more tequila but not bad. Decent service, fair prices."}
{"text":"Took 5 seniors for fresh fish, Mexican style. Raves! I had jumbo bacon wrapped, cheese stuffed shrimp with beans/rice/tortillas.. Charles had the Mariscos platter that had 8 styes&kinds of fresh seafood, including a broiled langostino. Beside me, Linda had Shrimp Diablo.. Great shrimp cocktails! By lunchtime the place was packed with local Hispanics, obviously hard working people, ordering huge meals; entire baked fish. Big meals cost about $20, but plenty of cheaper options. Great service at the table and beers
on tap.

{"text":"We usually love the food in this place but today was awful we ordered Grill red snapper and they brought a deep fried we order empapelado which is some kind of wrapped with a some seafood in it and no flavor. We found a piece of something where they claimed it was tomato but to me it looks like a piece of octopus tentacle or something weird. I hope they change the cook"}
