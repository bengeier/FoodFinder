{"text":"Grabbed a tiny little vegetarian quinoa salad from there today, that had no price listed, was a little surprised when I went to the counter to pay $10... Just like all the other reviews note, this place is pricey, even for downtown.... I don't mind paying a little extra for a good meal, but the flavor was bland & it was not filling.....  It was a fruit and quinoa salad, paired with horseradish dressing? Never seen that combo before - thankfully the dressing is on the side so I chucked it out....  Without any dressing, the salad was lacking flavor and the price was steep. Would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is located in Arts Common and gets some steady business from all the theatre and concerts goers. It is easy to see why once we sampled their wares. 

Good prices considering location. Happy we got there a while before our show as it filled up pretty quick towards curtain time. You can get all beverage to-go, or in some nice real mugs.

By the way if you like hot chocolate you should get it here. Frikkin delicious!
Coffee with Baileys was a lovely teat for the boy who enjoyed every mouthful.

They have the kitchen on the opposite side - restaurant divided into 2 parts. Seems to work though as most people sitting to eat naturally gravitated to the kitchen side anyway as there is more seating on that side. We shared the proscuitto and arrugula panini sandwich which was a good size and was devoured in seconds. The pizzas we saw come out looked good too. Nice fast service so we had enough time to drink our beverages without a rush to make curtain call.

If you are in the building and looking for a beverage/snack before a show definitely stop in. Would be a great DT lunch spot too."}
{"text":"While they advertise online as being open until 6pm they actually close at 4pm and generally start putting up chairs and closing seating at 3pm which makes you feel awkward for coming in and ordering anything. And while they also have signs all over Stephen Avenue and Arts Commons to tell you to come in for pizza, wine etc. they close the kitchen at 2pm so you can only eat stale sandwiches from the cooler any time after that."}
{"text":"Just horrible!  The Specialty coffee's come out of a machine and they taste like it. The menu keeps changing/decreasing and everything that people actually liked is now gone. I had the baked macaroni and the noodles where dried out and crunchy and the sauce had separated, the whole thing was tasteless and I couldn't eat it - after waiting for 30 minutes for take-out.  Super over priced, a simple sausage roll is $8 ?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Ca'Puccini is Teatro's new cafe, recently opened inside Arts Commons (formerly known as Epcor Centre for Performing Arts, or Theatre Calgary).

They offer coffee and breakfast sandwiches to wine, beer and etc.
Their normal hours are 7am-6pm MON-FRI but during performance nights they are open till late (10 pm) for pre or after show bites!

Have had coffee there twice already and liked it so far."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times the food was excellent. You can tell that they use high quality ingredients. Although the food and sett tin are casual, the flavours are exceptional. Today, I also tried the home brewed iced tea. It was lightly sweetened with honey - lovely. I will be a regular!"}
