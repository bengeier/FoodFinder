{"text":"Upstairs on second floor.  It's a self serve bistro.  Excellent veggie selection.  There are soups and chicken and sandwiches and deserts and coffee too.  A lunch spot for the office crowd.  Somewhat airy feel.  A couple of nooks to hide in.  You can take the food away as well."}
{"text":"I do like walking over to EAT to get some fresh air and some variety from Sunterra. But I do wish they had more gluten-free and fresh options. A quinoa salad would be much appreciated! I've tried the chicken Caesar and honestly found it flavourless - the chicken needed some seasoning. Their quinoa cookie is a yummy treat though!"}
{"text":"EAT has a great selection for the downtown lunch crowd, they really cater to anything you're looking for so it's great if you're with an indecisive group.   They hot buffet is really good and their panini's are excellent, highly recommend. There's a nice coffee bar with really tempting treats if you need a little pick me up before facing the afternoon.  The other really nice thing about EAT is there's ample seating and free wifi which makes it a great place to not just pick food up but also sit down and eat your lunch."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast location. It is conveniently located in the Eight Avenue Place building, which if you don't work in the building can still access easily via the +15. They have a lot of great options for breakfast including hot and cold items and baked goods. They also do catering."}
