{"text":"Definitely a fun bar.. spacious ..  but be prepared for the smoke and yes they do serve food too.  I was there early on a Friday night.. the smoke wasn't too bad.    I didn't get anything to eat but did notice the appetizer prices on the menu were no doubt above average.   Other menu items seemed typical.   Bathroom was super small. . I assume there would be a line if it was busy.  There's  a stage, pool tables and plenty of table seating.   The bar was a decent size - not too small nor big.  There was a nice outdoor patio outside.   No doubt a fun place.  Oh I will be returning at some point in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place.   The bartenders and servers are all very nice.   The place is clean inside and up to date.  The food is great and they have 5.99 togo 6 pack specials.  You can sit back and relax on the deck or inside at the bar.  They have many tvs, pool tables,dart boards and air hockey.   Not a big fan of the off street parking but the area is well lit up at night.   Make sure you check out the 100proof slushy drinks.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Great Bar, they ace every phase, from their food menu (wings are good, even for takeout), the staffs deep knowledge of mixed drinks, and the place is huge inside! Very clean and up to date, several big screens, jukebox is hooked up to surround sound, really sweet upper level outside deck, and get this: they even have a decent selection of craft beers! Really not a dive bar at all. This is the only true \"sports bar\"  in the area, very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fun place, lots of TVs, spacious, great air-conditioning. Sometimes the barmaids are a little bit snooty.  Bathrooms could use some cleaning, and they're smoking in the bar. Overall though, it's a fun place. I like it!"}
