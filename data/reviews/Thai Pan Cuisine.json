{"text":"We came here because of the great Yelp reviews and were not disappointed! It's a little hole in the wall and doesn't look promising from the outside, but don't get deterred by looks. I had the Tom Kha soup and Pad See Ew and both were delicious.  I definitely recommend coming here. Great service, super friendly owners, super tasty food."}
{"text":"WOW

The prices are even better.

Salad with beef
Chicken Satay with Thai Green tea
My wife and daughter, are very tough to pleased, and both of them really enjoyed their food with many compliments 
Happy eating family"}
{"text":"Thai Pan has terrific food!  We've enjoyed everything we've tried but our favorite is the mango curry. Very nice people, good prices, interesting menu, and they consistently cook to their spice scale. They are a great little neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Good Flavor!   They forgot the little pot with the flame in the middle for their soup though. It's small in there, 3 tables Only. But overall Good and reasonable$ ."}
{"text":"Great Thai home style food! Tried Green Tea latte, Thai Ice tea, Tom yum soup, Mango curry, Pineapple fried rice, curry puff, and mango sweet rice. Recommend all. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Very very good food !! I had ever eat.. Nice price. You guys should try...
  I god pat thai !! Rice noodle it come with egg , scallion , bean sprout and i got it with beef it was super good !! Really good. You have to try."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Food is excellent. Highly recommend if you enjoy authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time tonight and definitely will be returning. Super friendly and awesome customer service. My family enjoyed the teriyaki with veggies. the sauce didnt overtake the chicken/veggies which was good and the chicken was cooked just right. Ordered the beef pho and another one with shrimp and portions were spot on and taste better than others. Small place but a must try."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and the food was amazing!! The curry puffs and khoa soi kai were out of this world and the service was excellent! Next time your in town and craving some great authentic Thai food come here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"First time here looked up on Yelp and enjoyed every minute of it. it's near to csn campus."}
{"text":"I love to support local business.
Came from L.A. on Saturday, going have Sterling brunch on Sunday, 
decide to go for something light.  
Arrived at restaurant around 5PM, location was empty during our visit.
Order the Pad Thai, Chicken Satay 5 Pcs Yellow Curry.
Got two Thai Tea free for doing the Yelp check-in.
All food and drinks ordered were great, generous on the meats, ingredients used were fresh and handle with care.  Rice was fluffy and perfectly cooked.
Location was clean not only in the dining area, it's  super clean  in the back of the kitchen as well.
Server were nice, didn't charges us for rice when we ask for second serving.  Owner even came out to say goodbye when we leave."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service and very clean resteraunt. Definately a well known place for locals thats away from the crowded las vegas strip."}
{"text":"I saw the great reviews on yelp and decided to try this place. I'm so glad we did. The pad thai was very good, as well as the Mongolian chicken and spring rolls. The service was very attentive. A great meal for a great price."}
{"text":"Ordered take out Saturday evening around 7pm.  Right after I placed my phone order, I called them back to cancel one of the ordered items, they said \"no, we made it already\".  I highly doubt that you made it after just me placing the phone order.  That was already strike 1!  Then when I picked up my food, I saw they had a special that if you ordered over $20 you get a free thai tea.  I bought $50 worth of food and asked if I can have 2 thai teas.  The girl at the counter said \"no\".  That is strike 2!  Would it have killed them to make a girls day?  Then there was the food.  Having had a lot of thai food before, my family was not very impressed.  I guess you get what you pay for?"}
{"text":"It's better than any other thai restaurant in LA!!
Reasonable price.
Warm service
must try curry puffs and trust me it is sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"Veggie Pad Thai , coconut milk soup, chow main chicken  most definitely we are coming back for more Thank you!"}
{"text":"Sooooo, delicious! Had the Tom Kah soup with shrimp, and it had the perfect blend of broth and coconut milk. The shrimp were plump and perfectly cooked. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Such good thai food! The staff is super nice and the food is authentic and tastes amazing! Highly HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area a little over a week ago, and we love this place so much we've already eaten here 3 times. It's tiny (only 5 tables) and tucked away in a strip mall, but the bright minimalist decor is very welcoming and pleasant. The service is very friendly and attentive and food comes out promptly. And oh the food. So far we've tried all of the curries on the menu as well as the basil chicken. Everything has been absolutely delicious. Meat is tender and juicy, vegetables are cooked perfectly, flavors are bright and vivid, and spiciness levels are exactly as advertised. Finding this spot was a fantastic welcome to our new neighborhood, we'll definitely be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is one of the best. Great portions. Friendly service. My kids who do not like anything liked it. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was craving khao soi (curry noodle soup) and their version is excellent! The restaurant is small but clean and bright. The service is attentive and kind. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food tastes great. Very affordable lunch menus. This will be one of my fave lunch stops."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special that includes the Thai fried rice with chicken and shrimp added. The food was great and the portion size for lunch was well worth the price. 

The waitress was friendly and very tentative. This was my second time eating there and will visit the restaurant again. Please do not let the location or the homey atmosphere fool you."}
{"text":"Food here is great! It's a small family restaurant so the food tastes like home cooking. I ordered the specials off the wall and it was tasty. Prices are pretty decent too as compared to other Thai restaurants near the area. Large variety of items to choose from the lunch specials as well. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food! Quick and friendly service. Every dish ordered was on point would recommending trying the pad Mee mao and the red Thai curry"}
{"text":"Super lowkey and super good thanks for the beautiful service from the beautiful waitress kara :) i will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 lunch specials of pad Thai, one spicy with beef and one medium with chicken. There wasn't enough protein in either one and mine was absolutely not spicy at all and noodles were dry. Tom yum soup was pretty good so that was an extra star. Other than that, no thanks."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Thai food in a cozy nicely decorated atmosphere! Highly recommend the Tom Saeb soup of spicy broth and pork ribs. Service was above and beyond. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"First off, this place defines the phrase \"hole in the wall\". There are only 3 tables with 2 chairs each, so it's mostly for takeout. We ate there and the service was fine although the TV on what appeared to be an endless loop travelogue for Morocco was strange.

Now for the food, which is what we really care about, right? In a word, awesome.

 We had Pad Kee Mao with chicken, which is a standard for me. Even though we ordered it medium it was still pretty spicy. But perfectly executed with lots of veggies which was a bonus. And under the \"Vegetables\" section we got the dish called Tarzan. It was described as a list of veggies in a green curry. We ordered that medium too but it wasn't spicy at all. It was chock full of vegetables beautifully prepared and the green curry broth was light and flavorful which was super because I feared it might be heavy and thick. Served with steamed rice, we didn't even miss meat.

The only clunker was the scallion pancake appetizer. We ordered it because I had never seen it on a Thai menu before. It was more deep fried than the scallion pancakes I have had at Chinese Restaurants. It was served with peanut sauce, which was it's only saving grace, because let's face it, I could eat a napkin if it had enough peanut sauce. Wouldn't order it again but it also wouldn't keep me from eating there again because the rest of the food was phenomenal and while the pancake was fine, it just wasn't my cup of tea.

The portion sizes were generous, we were both full when we left and we have enough leftover for lunch today. (I call dibs!) and the price for everything was just $22.

So if you want great Thai at great prices, order Thai Pan. They will be my new go to takeout!"}
{"text":"Genuine authentic northern Thai food.   Mr. Preeda graciously prepared something off menu for us, they are amazing.  Highly recommend that you find your way there!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Our food was ready to go when we arrived for pickup about 20 minutes after placing the order through eat24. We ordered the mango curry, pho with chicken, the pad see ew, pad thai, and pineapple fried rice. Everything was delicious (the fried rice was everyone's favorite) and the portions are generous. For under $50, we got enough food for four people and even with some of us have second helpings, there are still plenty of leftovers. Four stars (4.5 really) because we ordered everything at medium spice level and it wasn't spicy at all-they did give us chilies to add ourselves, though."}
{"text":"Omg, I past this place 6 days a week n I finally deceided to come in.... Boy o boy, this place is Bomb.com.... All the dishes I eaten tonight has been so flavorful n yummmmmy, Im so coming back for sure.... !!!!"}
{"text":"The reviews are accurate. .. small. .. 4 tables. . Did not read reviews initially and almost left. .. DO NOT let the horrible location and hole in the wall appearance  fool you.  It is every bit as good as the 5 star Thai places I have been to in cities like NYC etc.. The food has a lot of flavor and your taste buds will thank you. .. I would definitely be a regular if I lived here. ... I didn't even look at the prices. .. but whatever they were. ..it was worth every penny! I don't take the time to write reviews but I felt this place deserved it,  if for no other reason than to express how looks can be deceiving"}
{"text":"Really nice and cozy place. Great service and good food. Drinks were very sweet and the atomosphere is very thai."}
{"text":"In town for work and it was 105 degrees. Of all the Asian options around, Thai Pan stood out with all the great reviews so I wanted to add to it so they keep providing great food and we patrons keep them going successfully. Great prices and excellent food.  Mango Sticky rice was to die for and topped off our delicious meal. We had it delivered and it came within 45 mins as advertised.  Online ordering was simple and quick.  Bottom line, all our food was excellent, medium slice was enough to still taste all the wonderful flavors, and everything was still temperature hot when it arrived.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden secret in Las Vegas. Excellent Thai food for very reasonable prices. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with a couple friends of ours tonight, loved it!!! Very clean restaurant, the restrooms and kitchen were spotless( you have to pass the kitchen to get to the restroom). 

Food was delicious! Hubby ordered the Tom young seafood spicy and I ordered the Pad Thai beef, also some pineapple rice for our little one. Our friends ordered pineapple fried rice also. Kara the hostess was very patient and helpful while she took our orders, one of our friends had questions about the Ingredients in the sauces and she was very informative. 

Dessert we ordered Mango sticky pudding and Banana wraps with ice cream, yummy! Prices on all of the food was very reasonable and not overpriced at all. 

The seating in the restaurant is a little small but we were able to fit a group of 4 and a toddler with a high chair, we noticed mostly people coming in for take out, but there's plenty of space to eat there too. We will be coming back for sure !"}
{"text":"Oh no! They are out of rice!? And it's still an hour before closing! You would think it will never be an issue since more than half their menu required rice. She was pretty convincing too that they were not willing to cook some more. Only thing I tried was the thai tea and that was somewhat decent."}
{"text":"Good solid Thai food that is well prepared and tasty . It is tucked in behind the Golden Arches building corner of Alta if you get lost."}
{"text":"Owner was Funny and very nice, and the food was great. This place is behind the mcdonalds on alta and decatur, nice joint to pop up in the neighborhood. Really excited to have a good pad thai place around the block."}
{"text":"YUM! 

I just \"discovered\" this place while heading towards \"home\" down Alta. 

I grabbed a carryout of Red Curry and Pad Ka Pharo. Those who know me know I can eat my weight in rice noodles so I'm not sure why I didn't choose two noodle selections. Oh well that's next time!

I asked for medium spice and I personally think it was mild. Maybe they held back? 

The Red Curry was flavorful and had tons of veggies thanks to the veggie option I chose. The spicy basil was good but I would like it even spicier :) the tofu was cut into the right size too. Very vegan and veggie friendly place. They even offer almond milk for their drinks.

Both my selections were from the Lunch menu and came with a sesame oil dressing salad and a fried ?spring roll? Both I personally don't care for so I will just order from the regular menu next time. But if you like those items, get the lunch option because it's a ton of food for the low price. 

I will be back!

Oh the sweet young lady at the counter said I could call my order in next time, but side note, it only took a few short minutes to get my carryout order and be on my way."}
{"text":"Awesome little place.. A hole in the wall with just a few tables but the food is really tasty. I will be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"The place is relatively small, but definitely don't let that deter you from going.  The service was good, the prices are reasonable and the food was excellent.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"The place is small, but the food is amazing! The service is warm and friendly. Such a cute place to go especially if you're trying to get away from the Strip. A true hidden gem in Vegas. I love Thai Food and the flavors here beat out a lot of high end $$$$ places. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really good food here, first time I've had Thai food and this people made it a better experience, it's small but really comfortable place. The food as absolutely amazing, I've been coming back here for the past 3 times. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great customer service, very clean and delicious food. You won't be disappointed, don't let the building (small hole in the wall) prevent you from trying to have an amazing dining experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new hole in the wall Thai spot in Vegas and it did not disappoint. It is definitely a hidden gem if you're craving Thai. The prices are really good and they give a lot of food. The Panang curry, spicy noodles (kee-mao), and basil fried rice tasted amazing. The Thai tea was really good too. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new Thai spot."}
{"text":"This fire Thai spot is so close to my house, I love it. Always very please with my meals here, my favorite things are their tom ka, tom yup, and larb extra spicy"}
{"text":"Last Monday I went to Thai pan again and I try the dish call Kaow-soi. It was so so good."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD & AWESOME SERVICE! my family and I (foodies) ventured into this place by means of curiosity.  The TOM YUM was great, very flavorful and  abundant with meats and mushrooms. The desserts, esp. the crispy banana is amazing. Do not let the  HOLE-IN-THE-WALL appearance fool you, the cuisine food can easily out class entree's from top Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. I agree , the place is small...but who cares, we came for the food! I pay for food not for ambiance...BTW the place is super clean...food presentation is neat and appealing! We will definitely break bread here again!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. Very clean. Food was delicious.  Would have liked the Thai spice just a tad bit spicier. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My dad says this was the best Thai food he has ever had. Personally I've had better but this place was good. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. My dad is a vegan and he wanted to order the tofu pad see ew which turned out to be pretty good. Red curry with chicken was good as well. All of the different meats we had were very tender. Yelp check in offer was a free Thai iced tea which was as expected. Place is small (14 seats) but very clean."}
{"text":"I ordered online and soon after i received a phone call from them with some questions about the food. By the time i got there food was ready. I decided to eat there and they were kind enough to provide me with dishes and water. Taste was quite good."}
{"text":"Thai Pan is a small family owned restaurant with outstanding service. The restaurant itself is small but comfortable. Their menu is small but nonetheless delicious. I appreciated the diverse dish options from other regions of Thailand, in addition to the traditional staple dishes. I ate here with my family and we had their curry puffs, Thai chicken wings, Tom kha, Tom saep, som tam Thai  and beef grilled salad with sticky rice. We also ordered their milk green tea and Thai tea. For dessert, we tried their fried banana, roti with ice cream, and mango with sticky rice. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, freshly made, and delicious every time. 

Our team was working out of the North Las Vegas Airport, and we ate here 4 of the 6 nights we were in town. No joke. 

A terrific family-run place, the service is friendly, as well as helpful in suggesting items to eat. They can also adjust the spiciness to your desired level.

Of particular note is their papaya salad. Every Thai place has a papaya salad, but not every place gets it right. Flavorful, tart, spicy and fresh, it's an indicator of the great food to come later in your meal. 

The restaurant is small and clean and casual."}
{"text":"Very good love the service and the curry noodles the bombs.."}
{"text":"Hreat prices!  The food was flavorful and delicious and now I crave the Thai coffee!  This is a small place but totally worth going in for a quick and delicious meal"}
{"text":"Update time. They've been open nearly two years now and have both changed the menu and renovated the interior since my last visit, for the better. Space is more modern and welcoming, menu has traditional rice, noodle, and soup staples along with specialties like khao soi- which is what I went in for, as it's an amazing  dish only available a couple places in town.

Soup was pretty good, with a rich and slightly spicy broth and a hard boiled egg, topped with crispy noodles and an entire chicken leg. I paired this with the curry puffs from my last visit and was happy to see they're still awesome. This is a meal I'd totally come back for, but I wouldn't do it during lunch hours- small space is packed and the kitchen and staff were clearly overwhelmed, and the half-hour wait for food is a bit much for a lunch break visit. I'm glad to see they're getting a lot of business though!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place. The food and service was awesome. The owner came out to greet us and had suggestions of what would compliment the khao soi dish, very heary and delicious. I had the pad see ew which was also very good!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a cute spot! We found this gem because we were at a pho restaurant, but it was truly not good. We decided to go with Thai and boy, are we glad we did! We fell in love with this place! Kara was wonderful. Super spunky and lively attitude, very kind and friendly. Once she found out I was vegan she made sure to ask me each time if I wanted my meal custom to vegan and I truly appreciated that. Now for the food, it was truly some of the best food we've ever had. Maybe we were passed the stage of being hungry, but it was SO good! I know for me, I woke up the next morning thinking about the meal I had, wishing I had left overs. We will definitely be back, and also spread the word to our friends that they need to try this place! Thank you so much for your wonderful hard work in assuring this was a pleasant experience. Oh, and one last thing. The cook even came out to ask how the food was, how often does that happen?? Truly happy"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Thai food yesterday.
And so I pulled up the yelp app as usual started searching around for some Thai food and came across Thai pan cuisine and decided to give it a shot.
As I arrived to the restaurant is a bit small but seats more than enough . I ordered the pad Thai with beef/chicken/pork combo spice level was medium for me and for my father he ordered pad ke mao his spice level was mild both of dishes came out great and flavor was on point Definitely will be returning for sure ."}
{"text":"Oh my gawwwwwwd. Absolutely 5 Star fantastic! I love Thai food but since I don't eat it as often as I would like, I usually go with green curry, papaya salad and Tom kah or Tom yum soup. But something about this hidden gem just pushed me to try something new.

I consulted Kara, who was very sweet, knowledgeable and welcoming. (Oh and found out after that her parents run the place and cooked my food! Support local family restaurants?? Absolutely!!!) I ordered a Northern Thai style papaya salad which was sweeter, pleasantly funky and loaded with vegetables. I had to try their tom kah koong, and that soup was the best I've had in Vegas. And then (because of her suggestion) I ordered the Khoa Soi Kai which is a curry chicken and noodle dish. Absolutely amazing! I wasn't even that hungry after my two apps, but couldn't stop eating!! 

I will absolutely definitely be returning and will be bringing my food writer friends to enjoy this diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Excellent services, great food with cheap price, place is very clean, I almost go everday there to eat day and night. Very fast service. More then five stars. Love it."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas. A cute hole in the wall restaurant. The area surrounding is not too nice, but once you get inside, it's very comfortable and you don't mind eating there. It's very very very small I wouldn't recommend bringing a huge group but definitely up to 4 or 5 people can sit together unless they put tables together. The service was quick. The food was amazing. I got the pork larb, spicy. Loooove it. I almost ate the whole plate. I also love the portion they gave me. It was a normal sized (still big) portion. I hate when Thai places load my extra large plate with a bunch of food that I never finish but get charged $20 per plate! This place is affordable, great for a quick lunch, and the food is just so good. It was $16 for larb salad & veggie roll appetizer...  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The staff is really sweet and their food is on point. Only issue I've noticed is their portions have shrunk, but still great flavor. Problem is, it taste so good I'm sad when it's finished. I guess I should order 2 of everything from now on."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Don't pass it by because it looks like a hole in the wall, the service and food is first class! They treat you like family! This is a family owned business and you feel as though you are one of them!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get Thai food here in Vegas! Very tiny place, but the quality is amazing! The restaurant itself is quiet, small, and very tranquil. Every singe one of the employees I've met are so kind and always ask if I need anything else with my order. Their Pad Thai, Fried Wontons, Wonton Soup and Thai Tea are so good! It's made to die for! It's full of flavor and for the price, it makes this place a jem! Love coming here and will definitely return many many times to come. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Worse Pad Thai I have EVER had! I was so disappointed because I have been craving it. Hopefully I can find a good place out here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Tried the garlic pepper beef and it was great. Good customer service too!"}
{"text":"This is my first review of this place but its been my third time eating here and obviously i love the food here. The place is small but one of the most welcoming and friendly restaurants i ever experienced. The staff is always happy and ready to serve you, anything from refills to suggestions on their menu. But most most importantly, the food is really delicious, doesnt take long but either way, the wait is always worth it that i have to stop by this restaurant at least two or three times a month."}
{"text":"Lunch special was great, inexpensive and the waitress refilled our water about 5 times. The tofu green curry and pad Thai was on point and their spring rolls were flaky and amazing!!!"}
{"text":"BabyGirl and I had lunch here on Friday (09/10/16). The restaurant isn't very big, but the staff is small so it works. The place was clean and the service was quick and friendly. Greeted us when we entered and wished us a good day as we left.
I had cashew shrimp and vegetables. BabyGirl had chicken pad thai. Both meals came with a salad. We enjoyed it all. Decently priced also. 
We will be returning to Thai Pan Cuisine."}
{"text":"Pretty good food at fairly reasonable prices.

We got curry puffs, pad Thai, green curry, and spicy green beans with chicken.

I think they put pork in our green beans instead of chicken...no bother, we eat everything! They were seasoned with tom yum koong paste I think. Super good but a little weird...

The curry puffs were good...like Thai samosas in a flakier dough.

The pad Thai was good but I'm never truly impressed with pad Thai.

Green curry here was good to me. Hubby says it needs to be sweeter for him but I'm not a sweet curry person.

The rice served with everything was on the dry side :(

Not sure I would come here again bc of all the bomb places to eat in Vegas but we were starving after our car ride and it did its job.

{"text":"We get takeout from here all the time. It is not close to our house, but it is our favorite Thai on the west side of the city. Family-owned by super-nice people. Good food, reasonably priced. I wanted something with a lot of ginger in it, the last time we went, and they made a great suggestion: Pad Khing. They made it as I requested, substituting baby corn for the bell peppers which are normally in it. I did not order it \"spicy\", because I enjoy sprinkling their chili mix (which comes around in the condiment tray) on it. 
I am just sad that I haven't been able to try the \"Sai Ua\" (northern spicy sausage) yet, because they can't keep up with demand, by customers who buy it in bulk to take home! Oh well, maybe next time :-) Did I mention reasonably-priced? Thai coffee: $2 bucks!"}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall only by size (4 tables and 11 seats), but it is a heavyweight on taste.  I had a small bowl of Tom Kha Goong, and it was considerably larger than your teacup sized small soup that you'll find elsewhere, and loaded with a ton of mushrooms, tomato chunks, cilantro, bamboo roots, and shrimp (4 pieces vs 6 pieces in their Shrimp Pad Thai).

I had the Shrimp Pad Thai, medium spice, just enough to get a little heat, but not overbearing.  It was done right, the noodles were cooked perfectly (sticky. but easily separable), and it wasn't dried out either.  The green onions crisp amd with a taste good enough to let you know they were fresh; the bean sprouts juicy and the stringed carrots too.  There was just enough peanuts to give you some texture without being overbearing.  The size of the dining area might turn people off, but the food will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Here for a conference and wanted to grab a bite to eat off the strip. Small place with a big bite. Service was great and food was amazing."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place as it's right up the street from our new house. Completely disappointed. The food was delivered very quickly (like, suspiciously quickly). I opened the Siam Noodle Soup and it looked like watered-down pink koolaid. It was completely tasteless, apart from a faint porky whiff from the broth, and the meat was dry AF. My fiancee's curry was also really under-seasoned and would up tasting a lot better cold from the fridge the next day. 

On the plus side, the curry puffs are BOMB. Based on everything else, I cannot imagine that they are made in-house.

Bummed this place sucks. We were hoping to find a new fave Thai place in our area."}
{"text":"Smaller than expected but it was quaint inside. We were worried about the wait, but it was not long. I went with a couple of my co-workers. I ordered Tom Kha with steamed tofu, & Spicy Basil with chicken (level 3). Drink:Thai tea... Yummy! My co workers order Pad Thai with tofu &  Food was delicious!  The owner Bank & Honey were very attentive and courteous. They made the experience Amazing!"}
{"text":"First of all, STOP reading this review and GET IN YOUR CAR NOW and drive to this incredible little restaurant.  Do it NOW, or at least between the hours of 11 am and 10 pm, Monday - Saturday.

I absolutely adore Thai food and Hubby adores me, so he's game to eat Thai now and then.  My adoration stems from the delicious Thai food I was accustomed to eating in upstate NY, where I lived before I moved to Vegas 2 years ago, and I've been quite disappointed in most of the Thai food here in Vegas due to the lack of authentic flavor, the steep price, or a combo of both of these.  Hubby also is quite hesitant to go for Thai as much as I would like because of these reasons.  Well, gentle readers, these reasons were all completely blown out of the water tonight by this delightful hole-in-the-wall!

I foolishly didn't take any photos of all the delicious dishes we tried because I was too busy happily stuffing my face, but I am including pics of the menu.  You can find all your classic Thai favorites along with chef specialties that neither of us has ever heard of but can't wait to try in the future!

This is a very small family-run establishment with Dad and Auntie cooking in the kitchen and the son Bank (so sorry if I'm butchering the spelling) serving us tonight.  He was incredibly delightful and friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed his helpful suggestions and descriptions of every dish.

We started with 2 Thai iced teas (both free with our Yelp check-ins!), a large Tom Yum Soup with shrimp (enough to feed 4 people since we each ate 2 full bowls), and the Chicken Satay.  The homemade peanut sauce and sweet pickles accompanying the satay were exactly as I recall from NY and the chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked.

Next, we had the Thai-style Papaya Salad medium spicy (I added a bit of extra chili oil to mine to make it a bit hotter like I prefer), which was, of course, perfect.  I really enjoyed the addition of yellow cherry tomatoes to the usual large, sliced red tomatoes and felt the extra color added a beautiful visual touch to an already delicious dish.

For entrees, we ordered the Jungle Curry with chicken and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice.  

The Jungle Curry is the only curry they make without coconut milk, but, trust me, the complexity of spices that are used is an absolute symphony in your mouth!   The small springs of young white peppercorns in the dish add a particular perfume of flavor and I really enjoyed separating the little peppercorns off the sprig and distributing them throughout the serving on my plate so each mouthful was perfectly delightful.  The Curry was also chock full of various veggies; the Thai eggplant was particularly enjoyable.

The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was easily one of the best we've ever had and we eat tons of Asian food all over the country.  The BBQ pork was legit the BEST: large slices of perfectly juicy and sweet meat.  The dish was also packed with delicious veggies.

Our intention was to only eat half the food, but it was so delicious that we ate about 3/4 of it and were forced to order the Panang Curry with chicken to-go (yeah, yeah poor pitifully gluttonous us!) so we would have enough leftovers to feed us tomorrow for lunch.

We were already completely stuffed from everything we'd so thoroughly enjoyed, but when I saw Mango Sticky Rice on the menu (one of my all-time fav Thai desserts), I couldn't resist.....Hot, sweet with the perfect hint salty, coconuty, buttery, ricey goodness with juicy ripe slices of fresh mango....you are everything I remember and more!  Shockingly, this was Hubby's first time with this dessert, but it certainly won't be his last!

I think I've probably exhausted my positive food adjectives at this point, but I'm just so thrilled to have FINALLY found a place to satisfy my Thai cravings without breaking the bank!  SEVEN different dishes were only a total of $55.70 plus tax!

I'm almost hesitant to write this review because I'm afraid the intimacy and at-home sense of hospitality of this place will be ruined when they are forced to move to a larger location when Vegas discovers what an incredible gem they have here, but this family deserves every shred success they will no doubt gain!  Thank you all, again, and we can't wait to come back and tell our friends!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food in town! Kinda hard to find but it's a small place, I think there were only five tables but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place really has good papaya salad. One of the best. But the mint chicken needs work. I love mint chicken. I didn't thing you could mess that up. When I eat Thai food mint chicken is what I order so I feel I'm semi expert at giving my advice on mint chicken. Wow...did the waitress just ask me if she could borrow the condiments and gave to the next table. They only have one to share. I was going to give this restaurant 4 stars after that move 3 stars. Not empresses what everyone raved about!"}
{"text":"They have awesome Thai food! Was hungry one night my boyfriend and I love pad Thai this was right down the street from us so we ordered not knowing what to expect & it was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend loves there peanut sauce & they give you a huge portion of the pad Thai! We started going here almost every week now they know my boyfriend  & the guy that works here not sure his name knows our baby son now and always says hi and even comes out to the car while I'm waiting for my boyfriend inside the place to get our order you guys are awesome! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Worth taking the time to seek out this small family restaurant. Excellent food,  and service at a fair price. The location is set back from the main roadway and as another reviewer mentioned, don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance."}
{"text":"Thai Pan is an absolute hidden gem. The food is authentic and always amazing. The service is fast and friendly. Kara is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place just blew my mind! Best food I've eaten in Las Vegas! Everything tastes fresh and authentic. I was spoiled and grew up eating Thai food that my neighbor made and it was incredible. I've been on a search for Thai food that's even in the same ballpark ever since, and have finally found it! Turns out it tastes so authentic, because it's run by a family- the mom and dad cook all the food. We ordered Thai iced teas, spring rolls, tom ka soup, pad see ew, and coconut sticky rice-and everything was incredible! Even the chili they brought to the table was fresh and tasted delicious. I'm so happy I found this place! This is nothing like other Thai restaurants I've been to- there is no greasy aftertaste, and the flavors are perfect!"}
{"text":"So I ordered from this place very last minute and didn't expect much for it being a hole in the wall spot... buttttt it amazed my taste buds! I am so glad I tried this place, We got it delivered and everything arrived hot and fresh. We ordered the grilled beef salad, tom yum soup, basil fried rice, massaman curry and potstickers. Everything was spot on and I am the pickiest eater you will ever meet and it left me in pure food ecstasy. I would highly recommend this place and will be placing more orders and trying more things on their menu."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant in all of Vegas! It's a small restaurant with just 5-6 tables but it's an absolute gem. The food tastes authentic,  like food straight from Thailand. The portion sizes are bigger than other thai restaurants I've been to but the price doesn't cost more, it actually cost less. You'll definitely get more for less here. 
We ordered:
 Tom yum noodle soup- variety of meats, so much flavor down to the last drop! My favorite dish!
 I can't stop thinking about it. 
Pad Thai- a very generous portion of moist, flavorful noodles! You can see the bright orange color on the noodles from the tamarind sauce. Very tasty!
Khanom Chin Nam special- if you like a hearty soup w tomatoes and pork ribs.. this is the dish! 
Papaya salad- generous portion size of fresh papaya, cabbage and veggies. Not too sweet not too sour but just perfect!
 I live on the other side of Vegas but I'll definitely make the drive every time I need my Tom yum noodle fix."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could! The food was amazing. Did I say the food was amazing...??? Because the food was AMAZING. I literally licked the plate clean. The pineapple fried rice with shrimp... Omfgsgehehdbndnd..... I can't even find words to describe how good it was. Soft and sweet pineapple bites with the spiciness of the fried rice and the crunchiness of the cashews, it all went so well together.  The other dishes we got were the mango chicken curry and tom yum soup. The mango chicken curry was really good too. The chicken wasn't dry at all and the curry was rich and creamy. I thought the tom yum soup was great too but my bf said he's had better. I loved the mushrooms and the shrimps were pretty huge. For dessert we got the sweet sticky rice with crispy fried banana and mangoes! We got the last mango for the dessert and it tasted great. The sticky rice and the sweet coconuty syrup was what got me licking the plate (I'm a sucker for sweet stuff..can't help it). 

Now that I've talked about the amazingness of the food, let's talk about the other things. This is a small hole in the wall place far away from the noise and lights of the strip. The couple who own it are super nice and our service was great. I can't wait to come back here again. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came across this place and it got good reviews, so thought we'd give it a try. I ordered on Yelp for pickup. It said the order was sent, but I never got an email confirmation, so I called the restaurant and the gal (Kara) said she didn't get an email with the order, so she didn't know what to make.  I tried again and she still didn't see anything, but when I looked at my cc it had two pending charges.  Ugh!  Kara said she'll call Yelp and get it figured out and call me back.  How sweet of her!  I got a call back and my order was correct and Kara said I'll only get charged once.  I was very pleased with the awesome customer service and the basil fried rice was great too!  We'll definitely order from here again :)"}
{"text":"Ive been here so many times and have ordered delivery a few times.  The lunch special is a great deal and the salad is always fresh.  My family likes the Tom Kha soup and Wonton soup.  I've tried the dumplings, Rangoons, fried rice, yellow curry, cashew chicken, pad Thai, spicy noodle & mixed vegetable.  Everything was great.  Delivery and dine in is very fast. The prices are very reasonable!  The wonton soup is really good!!  The pad Thai and spicy noodle isn't the best I've had but is still very good!!  This place is my go to for quick reasonable thai food!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay food. Service wasn't what I had expected. Food is salty too but price is good for portion size. Not satisfied overall."}
{"text":"This review is more to remind me not to order from here, than it is to discourage you. The Red Curry was ok. The Cream Cheese wontons and Pad Thai were very bland though. The CC Wontons didn't have scallions, and I'm pretty certain didn't have seasonings or Worcestershire sauce. It was really just the cream cheese. So they were very bland. The pad Thai was even more disappointing, I tried putting lemon, chili paste and soy sauce in it, but it just wasn't the same as a nice flavorful pad thai. I never think of Thai food as bland, but this really was. If I had been in the restaurant, I would have sent it back. So far I think Sun's Thai is my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a trip to Dillard's Outlet Store at Meadows Mall. Trusted Yelpers - sure enough, best Thai food in a long time. Great green curry w/chicken and Tom Kao soup -- best of class. Loved the free Tea I got by checking in on Yelp. Nice family runs this place -- clean kitchen, sweet smiles. Coming back!"}
{"text":"Small Thai place warm welcome with authentic Thai food
You have to try Curry Puff, Papaya salad roll was great Pad see ew and Khoa Soi Kai are excellent"}
{"text":"I decided I wanted to get Thai food for delivery I saw pan Thai on yelp I read a lot of good reviews on this place so I was like why not I give it a shot. The food took a little while  to deliver, but thats ok.  When I received the food it was nice and pippen  hot which is really good wasn't cold. I ordered chicken larb it was really delicious and the portions was very generous they weren't stingy like some Thai places are only give you a little portion. My boyfriend ordered the Drunken noodles very delicious It wasn't to spicy just the right spice where you can enjoy it and it also had a lot of meat. I would definitely order here again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My gf and I  discovered this place by accident Friday night after our regular place was closed as it was 9:00 pm.
   We ordered papaya salad, a small Tom Yum with squid, Ginger pork off the entree section,
and after seeing a table next to us with a curry puff appetizer, we added those to our order.
   Everything here is fantastic including the service as everyone seems to be family here.
Everything was super fresh and had great flavor. The owner came to our table and introduced himself to be sure we were happy. We certainly are and thank you!!!!!!!!!
   We will be back soon!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai shrimp with Thai hot spice & it was absolutely delicious! Noodles were very flavorful and the plate was big enough to share. Food was fast and service was great."}
{"text":"Delicious food. friendly service. The only complaint I have is the $15 minimum for a debit card. that's a little high!"}
{"text":"Love their pad Thai noodles and yellow combination curry. Made fresh for order and the waiter was super cool and polite.  Will come back to this restaurant when I have the cravings again."}
{"text":"First time trying this ordered pick up they had it ready quick and it's super delicious"}
{"text":"Food was good and very tasty
I order pad ka pow and tom yum pork rips
I will go back again"}
{"text":"A little hidden Gem. I didn't realized how often I passed it without knowing how good it was. Soooo glad I decided to stop last minute. My girlfriend was in from the East Coast and wanted pineapple rice. We found the closest place and popped in. Extremely happy we did. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was so just relaxing, cute and quiet. Please take a chance and stop in this little hidden restaurant. You will be happy you did. New favorite for me!!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai!  Fast friendly service, fresh flavorful food.  So happy to find a place on this side of town!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth it! Som Tum (Papaya Salad) and Larb are my two favorites and they were spot on! We also ordered Curry Vegetables, Veggie Pot Stickers and Thai Salad. Everything was very good. They even called after we picked up the food to make sure everything was ok. Great food and great service! You can't beat it! Definitely my new go to Thai. Next time I'm going for my other favorites Beef Salad and Panang Curry!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go every chance I get! My favorite is the green curry! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. Best Thai food ever. I found out about this place through Yelp last year and eat here as often as possible. The eating area is small and cozy, the food is great and the waitress is always smiling and kind. Its close to home making it easy for me to make a Thai food run. My first choice in Vegas."}
{"text":"found a new place to eat Thai, service, food, area and taste was awesome.  Thank you Thai Pan Cuisine"}
{"text":"It's a little warm restaurant hiding behind buildings. BUT ITS SO GOOD !!!! Definitely going back!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to go to! I love bringing my friends here because everyone is always happy with their meal. I suggest coming for lunch because their lunch menu offers a great selection and a really good price. Their basil fried rice and green curry are two of my favorites! The Thai tea is also worth getting. The service at Thai Pan is wonderful. They ALWAYS take such good care of me!! Keep in mind it's a small location so it's not the best for groups but it's still a place that you don't want to miss. I LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I would say this restaurant more for To-Go style than dining style, I came during dinner time and there was no music, no A/C, so the restaurant kinda hot for me. The waiter was nice but customer service is just fine, not really good with it. I ordered Khao Soi and Thai tea, Khao soi was good and come with pickle, lemon which is help to bring different taste for the dish. The Thai Iced Tea was ok, kinda too sweet for my taste. Overall, i would rate this restaurant fairly 3 stars since I have expected more than that."}
{"text":"Thinking about thai food and I tried this place. Everything I ordered was so delicious , the service was excellent and the price was reasonable. Loved it."}
{"text":"Man this lovely people came through two nights ago 10 minutes before they closed they made me a sticky rice and mango. The following day I went for more. Today I took my mommy and auntie they were fascinated by there delicious food."}
{"text":"I will bring more friends next time. Reason?

This is the second time for me here. And the food is kept their quality. I had \"Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngiao\" the rice noodle with Pork baby back ribs with \"Nam Ngiao\" Style mild Soup. Comes with fresh Bean sprouts, cabbage, pickled cabbage and Homemade Fried pork skin. 

The Green milk tea is just right not too sweet. If you are the Thai tea lover. I would recommend this one for you. 

The service is the best. I swear that I've been here only once.  Once the server saw me. He remembered what I ordered last time. And he asked me instantly. Would you like the \"Kha Nom Jean Nam Ngiao\" and the Green Milk Tea? I was surprised. And I asked him back how do you know. He said kindly \"you are my customer why not\" every time he's free he will come and talked that made me feel more important to this place. His name is Bank. He also works at Lemongrass The Aria. MGM Resorts International Group. That's why he's a Professional. 

I\"ll be back so soon. Thanks Bank and Thai Pan. 
You made my day."}
{"text":"This a a family owned gem!! The food is delicious, the service is great and the restaurant is exceptionally clean! Thank you, Bank, Kara, their father and aunt!! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really nice such as: good food, clean, customer service really friendly. I just arrived to Las Vegas for my vacation but I really happy with the right choice in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, great service,  great price! Small dinning area and family owned.  Love to take my family there when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Delicious drunken noodles and excellent customer service, definitely recommend this spot. Also my Thai tea was delicious"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Thai Pan Cuisine. My daughter and I came across this restaurant through searching Yelp, and we were so pleased. It's a small cafe, with orders prepared individually, and served fresh and hot. The food was delicious! Mongolian stir fry was perfect if you prefer no meat. On our return, we brought 3 guests plus 3 children ages 6-13. Kids can be pick eaters, but the children loved the meal! We ordered 7 entrees and all 8 of us were very satisfied. The Banana ice cream is such a treat for dessert! Our large group took up almost all of the space - it's like being a guest in someone's home. We were attended by friendly and engaging staff of 3. We ordered the Curry Puffs (delicious and unique), drunken noodles, chow mein, green curry, to mention a few. We will plan to return any time we are in Las Vegas. You could eat for less than $11 each, but we added in the Curry Puffs, the desserts, and an appetizer plate of samplers - & a well deserved tip."}
{"text":"We come here almost every week to eat out and every dish we order here has the quality of freshness, satisfaction, and good service. This will be my favorite spot to eat out for great tasting thai food."}
{"text":"Great little place, absolutely worth going. The curry puffs are amazing! The pad Thai was 8/10 (needed a bit more sauce and toppings proportionate to the noodles) but better than any other in the valley. The drunken noodles were 9.5/10, deffidently a winner. The Tom Kha was also delicious, a hint on the delicate side but still satisfying. Can't go wrong with this place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thai Pan is a small Thai family-owned restaurant with a limited menu, but the food is great. They have your staple Thai dishes such as Tom Yum and Pad See Ew, but this place is unique for carrying North and Northeastern Thai food not commonly found elsewhere. For an authentic Thai dining experience, I recommend eating here family-style and ordering their curry puffs, beef grilled salad, Thai papaya salad, and Tom Saep or Khao Soi with jasmine rice. I also enjoyed their roti with ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"If ever you share Tom kha soup with me, and you wonder why all the baby mushrooms are gone... (twiddles thumbs and looks to ceiling).  It's my favorite soup in Thai Cuisine.  The way they make it at this restaurant is perfect!  With the balance of lemon and coconut milk plus it isn't so watered down.  They put a lot of chicken in there too.

I tried their Pad Thai.  Usually I don't order noodles.  But I wanted one of those already set with ingredients meals.  It was awesome!  Chicken, veggies, flavor a little sweet... The noodles were not bland.  The order was a good portion.

Their restaurant is super tiny, only four tables inside.  I like the restaurant sign behind the register. There's one table outside, but at this time of year I doubt you wanna sit there unless you have a thing for butt roast.  The restaurant is sorta hidden between a check cashing and gaming store, behind McDonald's and Walgreens. 

Happy grubbing!  Or as their door notice says, have a pan-tastic day!"}
{"text":"Their tom yum soup and chi tea is bomb! They also de vein their shirmp... need i say more ?  ;p Lol"}
{"text":"Well this place was a HUGE surprise.  It looks like a dirty dump from the outside.. I was starving while waiting for a RX from Walgreens and decided to check it out.  Shocker... it had awesome reviews, was darling and SPOTLESS!  You know a restaurant is clean when they let you go through their kitchen to get to the bathroom.  The pad see ew is awesome, so is the pineapple rice.  This place is great for takeout."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food very tasty, very authentic. Family owned and operated, aunty cooking in kitchen. Very reasonably priced. Will definitely return with friends."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I ordered to be delivered and they were very fast, the only thing I have to say is that I ordered chicken potstickers and they send me veggie instead, I guess that anybody can make a mistake right!!"}
{"text":"We came for Pho, we ordered a number of things. Everything was great, they got the heat just right as each of us ordered it. 

We knew it was going to be good when we came in and saw Thai customers at the tables, Thai people coming and going, and a very pretty Thai waitress who had all the manners and graciousness of a fancy place in this family restaurant.

Its not big, pretty, or decorated much. Its the kind of place you might eat at if you were walking through a market district in Thailand, only very clean yet simple and all about the food.

The restroom is in the back, I suggest using it even if you don't need to. Why? Because as this is a family down-home kind of place you walk to it by going through the kitchen. You'll see people making everything by hand, the way it should be. Vegetables being chopped, meats grilling, noodles being made. It was all very authentic. The kitchen staff was friendly and I got the feeling I could have walked up to any of them and asked them to show me what they were doing and they would have been happy to do so. I regret not doing that and when we go back next time I will!

Our waitress had the traditional Thai meekness yet friendly and helpful. Each engagement with her ended in a slight bow. She was polite and friendly. being young it was also fun to watch an young Thai teenager, or maybe in his early twenties flirt with her and both were cute and bashful about it yet she was never unprofessional.

Yes this is a  whole in the wall in a less than nice neighborhood of not particular value or attraction. I gave it a high rating for its authenticity, friendliness, and low price for really good food.

We talked about it for the next two days and I'm anxious to go again next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! 

The food was so good, I cannot even think of the right words to express how delicious everything was. The lunch special comes with a side salad, a spring roll, and rice. The sesame seed dressing was to die for. The spring roll was fresh, hot and clearly made in house. Their red curry is amazing. The vegetables were so crunchy and the sauce had such a good flavor. 

This is a family owned and operated restaurant hidden behind Walgreens and McDonalds. It's so quaint and the food is so good. I would eat here every day if I lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch. Small and quiet but the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food as always!!! My 3rd time here. Cant wait to come back. The owner was really nice. Gave us free thai tea!!!Yummy"}
{"text":"Food: The food was mediocre, and I was disappointed. When I think Thai food, I expect a strong aroma of spices, which wasn't the case here. Everything felt pretty watered down and mild despite the level of spiciness. This place was surprisingly small, and seemed like they focus more on takeout orders. Maybe I'll try dining in to see if there's a change in quality.

Service: Great, great, great! A free, moderate-sized Thai tea when your *TAKEOUT* order exceeds $20, and an excellent explanation of what you've ordered. You really can't ask for better service."}
{"text":"First time coming here, as soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice guy. Gave us lots of recommendations and even got a free Thai tea by just checking in. The guy was really friendly and attentive. The food was one of the best Thai food experiences we've ever had. I recommend this place to anyone, even for people that never had Thai food. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly atmosphere clean, best Thai food in Las Vegas. Food highly recommended"}
{"text":"I wanted to try new thai dishes i haven't had before so we ordered off the speciality section. Had the s1 - Khao Soi - the curry noodle soup. It tasted great. Light, not salty. I would order again. My husband got the s3 - Khanom Chin Nam Ngiao Special -  i can say if you're not used to fermented shrimp/fish taste, you might not like this. But we're used to fermented food. He liked it a lot.  I thought it was ok, bit salty for me."}
{"text":"I am a Pad Thai fan, they make pretty good PadThai , very tasty. Highly recommend Pad Thai with shrimp and tofu, not with pork. This place is on my list now."}
{"text":"I noticed this new Thai place on my drive home the other day- they are set up mostly for takeout/delivery. 

I decided to order via eat24 tonight, and was very happy with my food and the service! The prices were reasonable, and the minimum order for delivery was cheaper than a lot of places in the area. My food came faster than the estimate (it probably helps that I'm just around the corner)... 

My pad Thai was really good! I always like to order pad Thai when trying a new Thai restaurant, I figure if they make good pad Thai it's probably a good sign for the other food. I'll definitely order from them again in the future!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in 2 months and each time it has been a 5/5 experience for me and my boyfriend. Lunch specials are cheap in price but rich in value-- you get a salad, egg roll and entree for $7-9 depending on what protein you get. Like the other reviews said, small interior but it is super clean and that's what matters to me. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum and yummy. Food is tasty, portions are good, and it doesn't break the bank. Pad thai, Tom Yum, and the Red Curry was good. Check in for free Thai Tea. 

Clean, friendly, tasty food."}
{"text":"Business owner like myself, I appreciated another business doing what they're supposed to do. They take really good care of their customers. Food always on point! Fast service and fresh veggies. As soon as you walked-in, you'll feel greeted with respect and very humble people. They will constantly ask if you need something that they could provide you. Very, good atmosphere inside. I'd definitely recommend them to every food lovers around the area. Also, they have lunch special!!! Call them now for some Thai Craving!!! Do not forget to order some Thai Tea!!! It's A+ for sure."}
{"text":"Great service with very tasty food!! 

Take out and pick up, you can't beat it! 

food is in a very good portion, price is very reasonable. 

Try it out, you would be pleased for your decision."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Huge portions, delicious, and inexpensive. Got the pad Thai and it was great. Will be returning many times"}
{"text":"M order pineapple fr n brasil with crispy pork that good i love it my favorite number 1"}
{"text":"Great place for take out. Dining room is very small, so not so great for dine in.

My office is within walking distance, so this gives me a great option when I forget my lunch. The food is a great value for the price. Lunch specials come with a salad, egg roll, and entree. I love the curry!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't like Thai food because usually the sauce in the noodles are too overwhelming... But this place found a perfect balance for the noodles and sauce, and for the first time I was able to enjoy Thai food. My dad and I came ordered takeout and we were pleased to find that they were very quick. Once we got there, you can tell they were genuinely very nice people. Customer service was great.

Once we got home, we were surprised at how big their portions were. The tom yum soup is absolutely great. We loved that it was more sour than sweet like it's supposed to be. Both the pad Thai and pad see ew had a perfect balance of sauce. It wasn't too saucy or bland. 

Highly recommend this place. Also, if you order Togo worth at least $20, you get a free Thai tea!"}
{"text":"This is one of the fewest place where you wanna come over and over again to try all there dishes.  Plus the host is really cute."}
{"text":"great food, friendly customer service.  they papaya salad is a must try. I love everything we ordered from this place.  truly a hidden gem of Las Vegas, and a little difficult to find but overall...excellent food and service indeed."}
{"text":"Awesome pork larb and panang curry, some of the best I've had in the area.  Pretty cheap too, $18 for both dishes.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot for my lunch break. It's convenient and the service is great. The decor can be a little better but overall great food. The sticky Mango rice is delicious"}
{"text":"Kind of a hole in the wall place (aka the food is amazing)! The family that own the place are so sweet and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great prices, and pretty darn good thai food. Not the best thai but close to it. Clean place and nice people! Will be back for sure!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I ate was incredibly delicious and super affordable. This will not be my last time here!!! I had the pad kee maow, this amazing noodle dish off the secret menu, papaya salad, and the simple appetizer platter. I washed everything down with a Thai iced tea. Not a single bad thing. Everything was fresh. The place is tiny but very clean and very nice staff."}
{"text":"Went today with my 2 cousins it was so good & very cute inside. I like the small environment because they always assist you better. The food was nice & got when it came out & it was good! Plate serving is enough to share with two other people. We order two main dishes Mongolian beef & pad se ew with tofu & a side of egg rolls & all 3 of us felt satisfied. Also, their Thai tea was really good!"}
{"text":"Like most of the other people who wrote reviews here, don't let the exterior fool you, this place has some of the best Thai dishes I've had since being in Thailand. The taste is authentic and the spice level is on point!"}
{"text":"Adorable little place, great service, delicious food.. you won't be disappointed. Thom Ka Soup was great, curry puffs were great. Massaman curry was delicious, with a fresh spice added I couldn't quite put my finger on. The sauce was thinner than I like, but still really good. Kara the server is a sweetheart, and her parents are adorable. Definitely the epitome of mom and pop perfection. They will be closed for two weeks at the end of April into May for vacation. Eat there!"}
{"text":"Wonderful clean  small place! Very friendly!!!  Food was amazing.  Spring rolls, won ton soup, xurry, and garlic and black pepper beef were all delicious!!!! Friendly staff. Food hot and fresh. Definately a place to return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Po Tak soup. is a must, service is wonderful, food is delectable I will be returning."}
{"text":"Been here three times. The food is great and I can't say enough good things about the service! Try the the Khoa Soi Kai soup. It's like a coconut curry based soap with egg noodle."}
{"text":"After seeing a pic of the Shrimp Pad Thai on Yelp I decided that this hole in the wall Thai Restaurant is where I wanted to go for our Friday night dinner. Yes like other yelpers said it's easily missed from the road & very small inside with only 4 small tables but sometimes its this type of restaurant that ends up being the yummiest! Luckily we were the only ones dining however no sooner a family came in with loud kids & a crying baby & it was at that very moment that being in a tiny restaurant like this totally sucked! Anyways on to the food..... My Shrimp Pad Thai that I was so eager to try was not very exciting. They forgot to put peanuts which was fine with me as I only really use a little of it. The waitress noticed & asked me if I wanted peanuts added but that was half way through our meal already. The dish lacked the orange/red coloring that you would expect the dish to have. This normally flavorful dish wasn't very flavorful. Ok on to what I became very excited for when I spotted it on  the menu -Mango Curry!!! I love Mango therefore I wanted this dish. It came and I instantly tasted the broth. Meh. It was very soupy, not thick at all & lacked that sweetness that you would expect from a Thai Curry. I sent that dish back because I thought by adding some coconut milk it would improve the dish. Well it did somewhat, the waitress told me that if I wanted it sweeter they could add sugar. Nah, I'm good. I was also disappointed by the amount of Mango or lack there of. Come on guys, be skimpy with your shrimp or steak but Mango? Load up on the Mango it doesnt cost that much. I'm also am very particular with my rice. After 2 bites of the rice & having the 3rd bite be a clump of hard rice I could go on no longer. The rice didnt taste fresh at all. In the appetizers platter the egg rolls were so tiny and fried extra hard that you couldn't even enjoy the filling of the egg roll. People do seem to like this place, maybe it was an off night for them- But whatever it was I was not impressed one bit especially with having to drive 25 minutes to get there. I want small local buisnesses to thrive but something was very off here for me."}
{"text":"A new job means new food options to check out for lunch. I stumbled upon Thai Pan on Google Maps and saw it was close to the office. I wasnt too sure about the area of Decatur and Alta. I was even less sure about the restaurant when I saw the outside. But once I walked in I realized everything was A-OK. 

Thai Pan is a tiny place. A little hole in the wall that seats, by my count, 18 people. It is simply decorated but classy. I was told to sit any where and was brought a menu almost immediately. I had already taken a look at the menu online so I knew what I wanted ahead of time. I went with pad see ew which is on the lunch menu (rare to see in my experience).

For $6.95 I got a small salad with a sesame dressing, a veggie spring roll, and my pad see ew entree. It all came out fast starting with the salad. The hot food came out scorching hot. The spring roll was ridiculously crispy and burned my tongue. It looked to be on the verge of being burnt but was not. The noodles were hot also. And kind if spicy (I ordered medium spice). There was a good amount of chicken, lots of egg, and two kinds of broccoli. It was a healthy portion and left me feeling satisfied and just ever so slightly full. 

When I was finished with my meal the histess came by to take my plate. But then it took nearly 10 minutes to get my bill. I dont know why she kept looking at me but not letting me check out. But she did finally bring my bill and I gave her my debit card to run. Then came the bad news. They have a $15 purchase minimum to run a card. I didnt have the cash to cover so she said she would have to charge an extra $1 to run the card. Fine. What choice did I have? She took my card back to the register and came back asking if this was my first visit. I said it was so she waived the $1 fee since I was unaware. That was sweet of her. I appreciate that kind of service. I don't very much like when places have minimums like this but for the to work with me like they did goes a long way. I enjoyed my meal and the small setting so I have every intention of coming back."}
{"text":"Consistently great quality Thai food and service. This small family owned restaurant is a hidden gem!  Always accommodating to vegan requests with many options.  Love their vegan Thai iced tea   :)"}
{"text":"Epitome of \"hole in the wall\" - do not let its looks fool you, Thai Pan Cuisine is truly a hidden treasure!

It is a small place in the north area, designed for mostly takeout/delivery or small parties. There are about three tables in the restaurant that seat four people each. 

Ordered the Pad Thai and it was a very generous portion. One of the best pad thai I've ever had. However, I also ordered the Yellow Curry (comes with jasmine rice), and dish was very thin. I prefer my curry of thicker consistency.

Overall: price is inexpensive, food is delicious, and service is very kind and quick!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of this place when looking for good food near my hotel, I quickly decided this need to be one of my meals while in town for work.

I arrived just after work at around 4:45 and it was empty.  I thought about getting my order to-go, but the small space was so cute I decided to eat in.  A few people came in to pick up their to-go orders but it was otherwise quiet.  My food came out quickly, probably only 5-7 minutes after ordering.

For me, the defining dish of Thai food is pad Thai so if course I ordered it (with a Thai iced tea as well).  Both were excellent!  Not the very best I've had, but, having lived in the Bay Area, that's very tough to find.  

That said, I'll definitely be back, probably during this trip!"}
{"text":"Great hole-in-the-wall family run place.  They have all the traditional Thai dishes you'd expect plus a few dishes that are not as main stream (Khao Soi for example).  Everything was delicious, fresh, and well prepped.

The restaurant itself is very tiny, but is clean and decorated well with some contemporary finished.  Despite being a small place, you can dine in without the overbearing food smell you'd expect...they seem to have very good ventilation.

Their take on Khao Soi is more traditional (curry, creamy) and is amazing!  Get this!  
Great portions on all dishes."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Thai food in Vegas, look no further. Don't let the size of the place fool you. This place is definitely the best in terms of taste. We tried the Kee Mao (drunken noodles), panang curry and basil fried rice. I tried to pick a favorite amongst the three but I love them all. The food came out quick and hot. 

The spicy levels run mild, medium and spicy. The medium is just enough spice to be able to taste all of the flavors. I asked for the spices tray to spice it up just a little more. 

The Thai tea @ $2.00 is authentic and sweet, perfect to reset your pallet during your meal (free Thai tea when you order over $20 to go). The mango sticky rice was a perfect end to a perfect meal. Nice and warm with fresh mangoes. 

It was nice to see regulars come in and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to visit the town last week was craving for Thai food and went there with my friend their food was great and one dish I had was amazing it's called Kao Soi this dish was the bomb if I'm ever back in Vegas again I would definitely visit this place again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dishes (of any cuisine) is Thai jungle curry (aka wild curry), essentially red curry made with broth instead of coconut milk (I believe it comes from the north of Thailand, where coconut isn't prevalent). It can be a little hard to find, so I seek it out when I travel, and the version I had here last night might have been the best I've ever had, anywhere.

I got it with seafood ($12), and it came with fish (cod?), mussels, shrimp, squid, and fake crab. There was a hearty assortment of vegetables, as is the norm, and the broth was exceptional! It's a good thing it was a spicy as it was, otherwise I would've eaten it way too quickly.

The space itself is small and cozy, with maybe six tables, Service was very pleasant, and I'll definitely be back (whether for the wild curry or to try something different) the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai place in Vegas we have been coming here for a while now they know me my wife and son and always have our order ready for us they are the nicest people and let me tell you the food is excellent and always fresh I have tried many Thai places here in town and nothing compares too Thai pan"}
{"text":"HOLE IN THE WALL!!!! 

So, I randomly discovered this on yelp while I was in the area.  It is located in a small shopping center and is a but hidden.  I didnt expect much but after walking in, it feels like youre somewhere else! The restaurant is a bit small, only a few tables.  We were lucky enough to be sat right away.  I unlocked the offer for some thai iced tea. Yummy! 

Anyways, for apps we ordered the sampler.  It came with crab rangoon, chicken potstickers, wonton, & spring rolls.  We then ordered the lunch special.  Entree with a piece of spring roll for $8.95, deals!!! We got the pork pad thai, pad see ew, and green curry.  Each dish came out wonderful & it was a big portion! The thai tea was so creamy and delicious! We could not finish all the food because it was just too much. 

As im writing this review im already craving for this!!! I recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in to have lunch with a friend. It's a tiny little place, but the food was delicious. I had one of the lunch specials, which came with a salad and an egg roll. It was a great price, and I really enjoyed my food. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My friend and I take an annual trip to Vegas, and eating on the Strp is pricey, and the lines are horrific.  So, we have our favorite haunt (McMullen's by the Orleans), but are always looking for someplace new.  Thai Pan Cuisine is worth returning to.

It's not in an upscale neighborhood, and we were actually accosted by a vagrant who was loitering in the Walgreens parking lot next door.  The place is cozy (tiny), not flashy, and as a result isn't prentnetious or annoyingly austantatious. 

We started with the curry puffs.  That was a great decision.  Crispy, well seasoned, and with some peanut sauce, freaking outstanding.  We also split the pad see yu, and chicken curry, both did not disappoint.  My friend and I are hefty Midwesterners, and sharing an appetizer and two entrees we were stuffed to the gills, which means that averaged sized people can probably cut out an entree. 

I also like that the place is family owned.  The waitress was the daughter of the owners, and had two batchelor degrees, one in marketing and one in psychology, but was dedicated to the family business.  

I'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"The kao soi was great and came in big portion. The vegetarian pad thai tasted great too."}
{"text":"I looove this place! So delicious and different. Friendly staff too! Every time I am in Vegas I make sure to stop by this place. Tom Kah Koong is amazing!"}
{"text":"The Best ! If you know it's here should be going here more often, love it. The new sign looks great too."}
{"text":"Small little joint not too far from the strip. Staff is very friendly, facilities are extremely clean, and this place is busy! Food came out fast and it was delish! I highly recommend it if you are in town and if you are a local you have to check out this place. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. However I'm disappointed that the girl working behind the counter. She would not let me sit outside to eat my meal. The inside of the restaurant is really tiny. Not a lot of table and chairs. Because of this I ordered to go. On top of that she didn't give me silverware with my meal."}
{"text":"Had the best Thai food in Vegas. The price was awesome. \" Banc\" server, was awesome as while. \"Auntie\" the cook is the boom.

Thank you for the service and great meal."}
{"text":"The owners here really treat their customers well! The service is respectful and fun! I thought the interior decor was modern and intimate. I came with my boyfriend and we ordered pad see ew and the tom kha gai (coconut lemongrass soup). The portions were large and the flavors were on point. We loved all of it! Oh, lastly! When the owners found out it was my birthday, they gave me a free thai iced tea. Yum!  (:"}
{"text":"Small, family owned restaurant with amazing food. This is my family's new favorite Thai restaurant in town. My wife and I get the tofu pad Thai. The tofu is done perfectly.  The pieces are small and cooked well enough so they are hard.  My children get the Thai fried rice with either shrimp or chicken. They love it.  They get a medium spice, which has good flavor without killing you.  I get the hot, which has great flavor with a decent kick.  The staff is extremely friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I definitely recommend you try them out."}
{"text":"First off owner...AMAZING!!!!!!!! second is the food.......AMAZING!!!!!!! they have these veggie potstickers which I swear I could eat 50 of. Tom kha delish, pad keep Mao very nice portion and super yummy. The papaya salad was such a spicy treat. Their egg rolls were good too, but those are easy to make. I am so happy I found this place. Let me also add I ordered food at 9:30 pm and they close at 10pm. Normally I'd be embarrassed to do that cause I hate being THAT person but I'm glad I did because I would have never known how great this place is!!!!!!!!!! I will be eating here again for sure and urge you to try!!!!"}
{"text":"Felt like eating Thai today. Fell upon this place since we were in the summerlin area. Was ready for something new. Small restaurant and quaint. Clean and cozy. Food was delicious. Freshly made-- every single entree. Definitely would be back."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Thai places in Vegas it's definitely a hidden gem.  The chicken pad Thai with tofu is what I order all the time.  The chicken wonton soup is perfect for the cold nights or a light lunch.  And last but not least the yellow curry with chicken is amazing the portions are great as well as the price!  I recommend you try the Thai tea it's delicious.  The service is amazing they are quick and nice I highly recommend this place if you love Thai food!"}
{"text":"Very good service. Sweet waitress. The crab Rangoon was delicious. The Thai iced tea was excellent too. However, I personally go to pad Thai restaurants strictly for pad Thai. This pad Thai here is very very sweet and didn't appeal to me at all. They don't give you an option to order it with spice. You have to add that in yourself and I prefer to have it cooked into the dish for added flavor. The prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"A very small place with only 4 tables inside, tucked away in the same plaza as Walgreens and McDonald's. Came here twice now during lunch, and both times the restaurant didn't have too many customers despite the fact that it was lunch time. Service is good, but because it's only one person working the front, if she happens to in the back or the kitchen tending to another table, service can be on the slow side. 

Food is decent, good deal on lunch special. Your choice of dish (you have maybe 15 to choose from), a spring roll and a small serving of salad, consisted mostly of iceberg lettuce. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're already in the area, it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai restaurant that has great Thai food run by a family that takes pride in their dishes. It's a small location - 6 tables, but big on authentic Thai food served with a wonderful heart, that it will make you want to come back time after time. Don't miss this hidden gem and enjoy a wonderful lunch or dinner. Thank you Thai Pan Cuisine...Namaste!"}
{"text":"I got there a little earlier than opening on a Sunday and ordered combination pinapple fried rice for my boyfriend and Beef Pad See Ew for myself. Took about 10 minutes, and when I took it home was floored by how heavy the to go boxes were. very good amount of food for the price. Also got one of the drinks in the cooler, only 1$ for orange juice. It ended up being 20$ for both entrees and the drink. Will order from them again, and try something else next time!"}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to this little gem and it's become my favorite Thai food in town. He was introduced to it by coworkers at Friendly Ford.  It's definitely a bit hidden and only seats about 15 people, don't let this stop you from trying it.  It's a family ran business.  Cara is super sweet and always remembers my family and all of our \"special\" requests.  To get to the restroom you need to walk through the kitchen which I like because you get to see just how clean and fresh everything is.  Plus they are always super friendly with us and our huge family!

On to the food... The papaya salad is the best in town!  My kids who are super picky eaters and don't like to try new things have been converted as well.  They love their fried rice dishes.  Our go to's are the fried rice, pad Thai, appetizer sampler, spring rolls, papaya salad, basil chicken, and Tom yum soup... oh and if you dine in you must try their crispy banana w/ice cream dessert.

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since it opened and like the food but recently the amount they give you really isn't worth the price they charge you. My husband just paid 27 dollars for a fried rice, wonton soup and a beef and broccoli. The container the beef and broccoli came in is so small that it looks like a kids menu entree. They should really start changing prices. Or at least give you what you payed for.  I don't think I will be coming back which is a shame"}
{"text":"First time here and we had the following:
Chicken pad Thai 
Panang Curry
And Pineapple rice.
Everything was excellent, the food has an amazing flavor. We were full and continued eating, delicious."}
{"text":"Super delicious. Taste just like Thailand the chef here are amazing I will be back tomorrow   I love their lunch special. The papaya salad is different from anywhere else I don't know how to do it. Super delicious too. Yummy. Thank uuuu."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Thai food. They have the BEST Khoa Soi Kai and the fried tofu is the BEST in all of Las Vegas. I have not had something I didn't love. The staff always makes me feel welcome and like part of their family. I can't say enough about the great food and amazing people at Thai Pan."}
{"text":"Perfect ! Very calm and friendly place... Excellent service, cheap, a lot to eat, and very tastefull. A Must Go in north Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered my normal Thai staples for the first visit here. Tom Kha soup and some crab Rangoon. 

The Rangoon is a very small order. Good for one person but not enough for 2 in my opinion. 5 very small ones. Tasty though. 

Soup was great. A large bowl for $8 is a great deal.  

Tiny place, only 3 tables. Very nice people, good prices, tasty food. Easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very yummy!!! I ordered the steamed veggie potstickers with the tofu pad Thai and they were both delicious! I usually go to Pin Kaow and am happy that I decided to go here instead. I ordered for pickup and the food was still hot by the time I got home and still made a pit stop. The portions are big and very filling! Will definitely be coming back! Also the staff was very friendly and kind."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a coworker and we loved it! The service was excellent and very clean. It is small but decorated very cute from the outside in. I ordered the Mongolian lunch special with tofu and it was so yummy. Lunch special came with a fresh mini salad as well. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Was in Vegas for a trip and I was craving for some Thai food for some reason. Ended up ubering here from my hotel, and the trip was worth it! The restaurant is a little far from the strip, so you have to drive.

The food is reasonably priced and really flavorful, but not overly salty or oily! I loved the chicken pad see yew and my boyfriend loved the thai fried rice with chicken. We got mango and sticky rice for dessert and that was soon good.

Service was also really great here too! The waiter (I forgot his name sadly :( ) is really nice and attentive. He's actually from my hometown!

PS I also love the lemon infused water. It tastes so refreshing here and i don't even know how? Would definitely come again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"We were craving for Thai Food and chose this place cause they had 4.5 stars we were very disappointed I drove 4 miles the one across the street from us is better and they have 3 stars I gave the 2 stars cause thy gave us 2 free Thai iced teas and they were very nice people."}
{"text":"Amazing tom yum soup, egg rolls and papaya salad! Customer service was excellent as well the young man at the front was very knowledge able about the menu. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"You may experience a little difficulty in locating this restaurant but persevere and you will be well rewarded with service that is friendly and family oriented.  The quantity and the quality is uncompromised as to extraordinary taste and flavors that just leave you singing.  We were fortunate enough to try the Curry Puffs and they were so delicious and mouth watering so unforgettable that you are tempted to skip the entree.  They were meaty and spiced perfectly with the right amount of curry and vegetables.  The combination Pad Thai was incredible, came out piping hot full of assorted meats and noodles...wonderful taste.  The second dish we ordered was the Tom Kha soup with vegetables and rice noodles. This dish was so full bodied and flavorful.  You cannot leave this place without feeling very satisfied and well fed. A definite \"BANG\" for the buck."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai and Pad See Ew in town!!! Amazing lunch specials and super friendly! I have gone twice this week since I found them!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable, and very intimate. With just about 4 or 5 tables, this restaurant is a perfect spot to hang out with a few friends and enjoy a good meal. 

Their Tom Ka soup is to die for, and their mango curry is pretty good although it tasted a bit bland for what it was. They have an extensive menu, so I am sure you can find something you like. 

I gave it 4 stars because of the service. Although the server was attentive, she seemed a bit uninterested in checking in with us and refilling our drinks often. Being the only table there, I thought we would get a bit more/better service.

If you are in the neighborhood, this is definitely a 'should try' type of place."}
{"text":"Great food for the price is actually so good i ordered take out. Yellow curry was bomb. Tom yum soup off the hook. Will be back again soon"}
{"text":"This little place is a hidden gem. The food was cheap and customer service felt like a family vibe. I do like supporting family businesses and these folks put a genuine effort in. I had the Khoa Soi and it was unique. They have the common Thai dishes but their house specialities looked awesome. The Khoa Soi was a curry broth with egg noodles and chicken drumsticks. The spiciness is toned down for Americans too. Kara was a sweetheart that served us with a smile that the Thai folks are known for. I helped translate for Chinese tourists and Bank the owner came to personally thank me. The Thai Ice Tea is awesome too.

I definitely recommend checking this place out. I came in to kill time getting my car done at G&G Autohaus and they recommended this place and they were right."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas! It is really authentic as if you were eating your mother's home made Thai food!"}
{"text":"Just a little place hidden behind McDonalds on Alta and Decatur with about 5 tables.  A lovely mom and pop and daughter Thai restaurant serving their guests with Thai hospitality.

Their menu have a few items not found in most mainstream Thai eatery.  Try Khao Soi, curry noodles from Northern Thailand and Khanom Jean Nam Ya, fish coconut curry from Southern Thailand.

Take it from a Thai, aroy mak, ."}
{"text":"Seriously the best thai food Ive had in Vegas. My mother in law and I randomly found this place. We went in for dinner about 8:45 so the place was empty. I am so happy we decided to stay and try it out. We wanted to try a little bit of everything. Every dish we had was delicious! My favorite was dessert... sticky rice with mango! The waitress was very nice and friendly. Its a far drive for us but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best thai restraunt in town and they have amazing \"Khoa Soi.\" The staff are all so nice especially the young woman in front providing quality service. One of my favorites getting over there is the \"Curry Puff\", highly recommend it if you love curry. They have other authentic Thai cuisines as well that you will definitely recognize once you get there. Overall satisfaction 5 out of 5:)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their food is consistently delicious. The Lunch Specials are a bargain. The restroom is in the back through the kitchen-usually I never want to seethe kitchen. I'd rather be happily ignorant, but their kitchen is spotless!"}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant tucked in behind Walgreens. Excellent food, the Thai Tea is fabulous, and the lunch portions are a perfect size with a spring roll and salad the plus is that the deliver free within 3 miles and I am within the area! Woo hoo! No more bad delivery for me!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. I've also brought others with me and everyone loved their meal. Great for delivery too. I don't eat meat and they have lots of meatless options. The server I had remembered me after not being here for weeks--she remembered I didn't eat meat. I'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Perfect Tom Yum, which I have a hard time finding. And they deliver to my work, which is also hard to find. went twice in one day my first time and will definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Really Nice place, good food, Pad Prik King pork is really delicious taste like real Thai food in Thailand. And the owner are really nice. I will be back again."}
{"text":"This may be one of the city's smallest Thai restaurants and also one of the best!  The whole place has about four tables.  I ordered a take-out dinner of Chicken Basil and Thai Spring Rolls.  The Spring Rolls were cooked perfectly with a nice crisp bite and warm insides.  The Chicken Basil was excellent!  When I opened the container I was greeted with the wonderful aroma of basil!  The vegetables in the dish (carrots, beans, green peppers) were cooked just right so they still had a nice, tender snap when you bit them.  The chicken was thinly sliced and every piece was tender and tasty.  All this was complimented by a great sauce along with a generous helping of white rice.  And the price was very reasonable.  A very good deal for a very good meal!  If you hungry and can find the place, which is kind of hidden in an alley behind a McDonalds, this would be a great choice!"}
{"text":"The Thai Pan Cuisine is gem hidden in the rough of an unassuming aging strip mall. Don't let that fool you or frighten you away. When we pulled up to park my wife asked if I was sure I wanted to eat there. I said that many reviewers couldn't be wrong and they weren't. 
Primarily set up for take-out, there is seating for 8-10 customers in the small dining area. The business is family run and everyone was very friendly and accommodating. The portions were large and delicious. Between the two of us we had an appetizer, two bowls of soup and a curry entree and we took home over half of everything except the pot stickers which we finished quickly...delicious. 
We are infrequent visitors to the area but this is definitely on our visit again list."}
{"text":"Great portions, came here for lunch, order the Chicken Pad Thai and was more then enough for two people. Awesome place to come by."}
{"text":"Saw their high ratings on Yelp with just a couple hundred of reviews, so it looked promising, and they delivered well! I had their Khoa Soi, which was absolutely phenomenal. I've never had that dish before, and I feel like they have set a bar for it. My friends got the Pas Kee Mao and Beef Panang Curry and they had nothing but only praises for them. 

The place is quaint and calm--it's tiny--it's beautiful inside. Definitely a place for a quite dinner.

The service is great! Straightforward and sweet. 

Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Food is average. Good for when I want some curry but, don't want to drive far or wait long. I do love their veggie pot stickers though, hard item to find without meat and they make them well. Inside is small, only 3 or 4 tables. The girl working as hostess and server has always been quiet and polite. Overall a nice place and good food just nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my mom, the place is tiny, however this \"hole in the wall\" is a local hidden gem. The server was very attentive to us, let us know about the popular items, also about their Yelp check in special. We ordered a Thai feast starting with refreshing Thai tea, veggie rolls, tom kha, beef salad which was delicious, and drunken noodle, which are both large enough to share, despite being full we also ordered some pad Thai to go. I will definitely be back. We also took a menu to go for future take out. Hope this place is here to last and maintain their authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner and had pho soup, it was okay. They didn't have any of the fresh basil, and spouts they usually I give at pho places or rooster sauce or hosin sauce I guess u have to go to pho places to get those."}
