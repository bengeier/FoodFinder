{"text":"Can give a  negative  star?  My sister and I am staying at the resort and decided to have a light breakfast this morning. We ordered blueberry muffin, croissant and fresh fruit. the muffin  was dry and the croissant was stale. The fruit was not fresh. Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Ryan is an amazing bartender, and is incredibly gracious when tending to a crew of hung over people who partied at his bar too hard the night before. He's cute and doesn't mind serving repeat orders of water to rehydrate his patrons. Come see him to both hurt your liver and the next day to recoup. Andrew, the other bartender stud, is awesome at helping you not remember your night, and very kind when providing next-morning gingerales to settle the pickled livers. Come see them to have an incredible night, in a beautiful setting, with exceptional bartenders that take awesome care of you."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour but need to change the more frequently.  Breakfast is buffet and not very exciting for $20.00 
Have had dinner both in the restaurant and at the bar.  Their fish of the day has always been perfectly prepared.  Service in the restaurant can be good to so so"}
{"text":"Just this weekend, I celebrated my 21st birthday with a big dinner at Kitchen West. Overall, it was simply fantastic. Our server was Amy, and she made the whole experience magical. She was funny, knew what she was doing, and did it all with humor and charm. My guests and I adored her! She went out of her way to accommodate us and left no room for issues. An AWESOME person. 

The restaurant itself is simply gorgeous, nestled inside the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch, which is also a beauty to behold. I was able to book the private dining room, and it was gorgeous. Stunning Tuscany-style room, very romantic and elegant. Sat 15 guests total and just worked out so well. Each guest had their own personalized menu with my name and celebration on it, which was such a lovely touch. The food was excellent. All guests were satisfied. The staff was awesome enough to send in an awesome gentlemen to play guitar while dinner was served, and that was beautiful. I had my cake made by the resort/Kitchen West as well, and it was beautifully done. The pricing for the private dining room was completely worth it too. Many restaurants charge $1000 minimum for food costs. Kitchen West was significantly less than this AND had perks that no restaurant could offer. 

All in all, everyone, myself included, fell in love with Kitchen West and the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. It was a beautifully arranged event, and I would give my money to them time and time again."}
{"text":"First time at Kitchen West and very impressed!! We're not easy... Everything we ate was delicious -- creative cookery , well prepared, and generous portions. The salmon \"chop\" was a large salmon steak, perfectly cooked to our requested rare to medium rare. The scallops too were a generous portion of 6 large scallops with delicious veggies. Our salads were exotic and delicious -- with edamame, heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, lentil \"caviar,\" and more goodies added to mixed greens and veggies. We added a side of sautéed spinach in garlic and oil, and a mound of exquisitely fresh spinach arrived. High quality fish, veggies, and generous potions large portions. The service was a little slow, and I wasn't crazy about the wines by the glass (wines need a reboot), but the delicious food dominates the experience, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant in the resort. Ordered mole meatballs that sounded interesting but was bland. Came with naan. Must order though is the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Delicious! Live music on the weekend and great coffee/service. Fun patio if it's a nice day."}
{"text":"Nice setting and a great manager, but that's where it ends. After standing at the desk for a minute, the hostess appeared from the kitchen with her mouth full of food. No personality and never made eye contact. I'm honestly not sure how she could get that job missing such key traits. Waiter was a salesman. After id said no twice he continued to push the idea of desert in front of my kids. No parent appreciates that. The food was not very good. My wife ordered the open faced chicken and i the flat iron steak. Steak was OK and her chicken was pretty bland. Overall it was not worth our time even though we were staying in the hotel. Not a wonder all the top rated places were Booked!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem!  Have loved every meal we have eaten here during our stay at the resort (and there have been many). The staff is awesome and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Dinner was superb in every way. The vegetarian burger is by far the best I've ever tasted, and the most unusual, with blueberries, edamame, farro, fresh corn and more.  My companion was able to cut his steak with a fork. The homemade na'an bread came with tomato and cherry tapenades...delicious. Our server, Ela, gave excellent suggestions."}
{"text":"I'm here for Christmas and had dinner. I had the New York strip which came with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and mixed winter vegetables. The steak was delicious and so were the sides. I also had the burrata with heirloom tomato salad. The burrata was very fresh and gooey. So tasty! For dessert I ordered the Vanilla raisin bread pudding. Seemed Christmasy. Was delicious. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My gf is here for a conference so I tagged along on her trip we hv eaten here 3 times in 2 Days now and if we had a Car and she didn't hv vouchers for food we probably would skip this place 
Lunch - salmon salad was lacking ; most lettuce had brown ends but so hungry after getting on a 7am flight and landing at 10 and waiting another hour for lunch to be served 
Also the salmon was cut up not what I am used to and COLD like just taken out of fridge not even room temp so that threw me off bc I hv nvr had cold. Salmon salad

1st night dinner Monday night they do burger special - I actually had to ask our server what the burger special was to which he said a burger and beer and that was it 
So I had to ask what beer they had what kind of burger to which he said regular burger so it was like pulling teeth I asked what it came w he answers ketchup!! I gave up 
But the burger comes w potato , lettuce Onion and tomato - it actually was pretty good 
My gf was upfront about hving a food voucher so maybe that's why he wasn't into our table he wasn't expecting much? He barely came back 

2nd night dinner really what is wrong w the servers 
We wanted to sit outside there were other tables there our guy doesn't even tell us the special, my gf ordered fish but didn't wnt the rice and asked for cauliflower and he said he would check and let us know if available bc sometimes the kitchen runs out and does not yell them ... fine reasonable enough but he never came bk to tell us 
We had to ask and he goes yes of course u can get cauliflower as if we were supposed to know that our meal comes and I was halfway done w my water and no refill doesn't come by to ask us if we were good 
Table next to us had a girl waitress and she went into details about the special snapper and scallop her explaining the dish made me want the specials I love scallops she was so on point and made it a point to ask her name AMY she was so tentitive to her table I was jealous and asked if she would working tmrw our last night bc yes my gf has another food voucher but she's off on wed 

Tonight will be our 3rd night and I am not looking forward bc the service makes the meal the food is decent nothing to rave about but w the crappy service def doesn't make the food that enjoyable"}
{"text":"who knew a hotel restaurant could be so much fun.  We had a \"living social\" deal so we gave the restaurant a try and glad we did.  From the most entertaining server (Amy) to the outstanding dishes we had, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The tomato/basil soup is enough for a meal..the baby lettuce salad with pecans was DELISH..and our main courses put us over the edge.  We chose Salmon and my husband's choice was a very very tender pork..all with names we can not remember.  But we can not forget Amy.  I give this place a 2 thumbs up for a delightful dinner with excellent dishes.  we will return."}
{"text":"The waiter offered me a 25% discount for being a Veteran. 
The piping hot, fresh baked flat bread, with a tomato jam and an onion jam selection was delicious.

The petite filet mignon in a Demi-Glacé, was fabulous.
The bone in Pork Chop was HUGE (picture) delicious!!!
The cherry gobbler was excellent!
Extremely satisfied with the service, exceptional quality of the food and portion size, as well as the value for the price!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed happy hour with Mrs Beautiful on a Wednesday. The atmosphere is the highlight though the drinks, eats and service were solid. Recommend this place"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! This place was great from the staff, to the pool, to the room. About to see how the food is  Here for a staycation and would recommend to locals as well as visitors  Would stay again."}
{"text":"Good menu options, service was good. Clean. It gets 3 stars because there was SOOOOO much butter and salt on the vegetables and small portion considering the price. I had a layer of butter on my lips after every bite. So could do a little less. The grilled chicken was chewy/rubbery; seasoning was good but texture was not."}
{"text":"Staying at this hotel for a party and used the restaurant for dinner. Normally hotel restaurants or mediocre at best. However since we were on property we decide to stop and have dinner and I ordered their special which was scallops. They were probably one of the best orders of scallops I've ever had. They were  very tender and very well-prepared. The restaurant isn't overly classy but was very well appointed.  All the staff is very friendly and service was very good. The wife had a Caesar salad and based on her report the salad was very good."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick and Kitchen West is located on premises. 
Ordered the mac and Cheese for the kids it was good and homemade not from a Kraft Box. The kids loved it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed many happy hours at 640. The bartenders know their stuff. I was rocked by the old fashion by Matt;   Better than mom made. Also enjoyed the cucumber jalapeño margarita. If you live in the area or staying at the resort  stop in for the meatballs and drinks before 640pm.  Jose is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"We found a Groupon for this restaurant, and at first I didn't felt so attracted to try it because we live so close from the restaurant, however the reviews were excellent and we decided to give it a try., 
I'm happy we did!
Also the hotel where this restaurant is located has been supporting the McCormick Ranch Christmas Festival year over year, so showing some love back doesn't hurt.
We tried to reserve by phone however the line send us to a voicemail, then we decided to try OpenTable and we didn't experience any problem by doing our reservation from a third party site. 
Let me say our server Justin was incredible, sweet, friendly and attentive, taking care of every detail even before we asked, and not being pushy at all, always with a smile and genuinely patient enough to wait so I can decide what to order. 
The portions were generous, and we finished satisfied and delighted, we started with the Alaskan Smoked Salmon Spread and the Herb Shrimp Crostini for appetizers, they were delicious!  Then we got the Bucatini Primavera with Chicken and my husband asked for the Grilled Rib Eye steak, both of them full of flavor. For dessert we got the Dutch Oven Peach Cobbler with Vanilla ice cream.
We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was excellent the food was excellent the service was excellent and it was seriously the best salmon I've ever had in my life. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast meeting at Kitchen West earlier this week while attending a conference.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast - nice choices and good quality food.  I had some egg whites with salsa verde, fresh fruit and a croissant with blueberry preserves...quite tasty and just what I was looking for!  I have to say that I was so impressed with all of the servers - very professional (even remembered my name the next day - impressive), attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This wonderful restaurant is the real deal. My wife and I had the smoked salmon board, steak frites,  and pork chile verde. The food was delicious, and was only outdone by the great service. Our server was both friendly and attentive, and the manager even stopped by to show her appreciation for our patronage (a really nice touch that doesn't happen much these days). We'll definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in the Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. Although they mainly cater to resort guests, they are trying to reach locals with offers on Groupon, etc., which is how we came to dine at Kitchen West. We pretty much had the entire place to ourselves, only 1 other couple was there. There were some folks in the bar area, & as the night went on, the bar got busier. Our Groupon was for 1 shared app, 2 entrees & 1 shared dessert. We were greeted by our friendly server, who then brought us a house-made flatbread, similar to naan, with caramelized onions for a topping. Soooo good! For the starter, we selected the Cilantro Shrimp Ceviche. Surprise! No shrimp! It came loaded with calamari and octopus (legs with tentacles!!) When we flagged our waited over & told him there was no shrimp in the shrimp ceviche, he looked a bit stunned, almost like he didn't understand, then said, \"Well, something happened.\" He was gracious, and we opted to go with the roasted cauliflower & Hummus. Great choice.  Hummus very flavorful & there was purple, yellow, green & white florets. Delicious - try this! Our entrees were the flat iron steak and the halibut special. Steak prepared to perfection & topped with a yummy herb chimichurri. The shoestring potatoes were excellent, too. Halibut wonderfully prepared; flaky & moist. Not a fan of risotto, but the parmesan risotto was quite tasty. Side of mixed veggies rounded out the entrée. Desert was apple and blueberry cobbler. Meh. Warm, some apples cold. It wasn't overly sweet as cobblers tend to be, but other than that, pretty much flavorless. All in all, very good food, well prepared and pleasing to the eye. Staff helpful and friendly. Would recommend - we'll return for sure. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the shrimp ceviche with no shrimp. Other that that, a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"We had one of the most fun lunches I have ever had! Our server, Amy, was exceptional. She informed us on every food option, gave great recommendations, made a great latte, and there was never a moment our drinks were empty. Her personality made the experience so much fun! I will absolutely ask for her when I come back."}
{"text":"Ambitious menu that isn't pulled off.
MANY ingredients are swapped out and or missing ingredients of plates described
The food we were served mostly tasted NO WHERE NEAR IT LOOKS
VERY POOR NON PROFESSIONAL  execution of a protein in a high end resort


What drew me to Kitchen West was the amazing menu I read on-line. I thought that is what I want to eat. The resort setting seemed like a bonus. It just sounded like it had to be the FIVE STAR experience I was hoping for.

A cheerful pleasant waitress took our order but then started working outside and then other people and the manager started serving us.

 I also note that this restaurant wasn't busy at all. We were one of two tables in a large restaurant.

We started with the two for $15.00 appetizers of Foraged mushrooms Kiln Flatbread and Fried Mesquite Honey Cheese Curds.

The Mushroom Flatbread was missing the toppings of Foraged Mushrooms and Chimmichurri. A spreadable cheese was substituted for provolone. We inquired about the mushrooms and a manager kindly had the kitchen cook us up the mushrooms we were missing. She apologized to us and very kindly took our appetizers off the check and boxed up the appetizers for us.

The Fried Mesquite Honey Cheese Curds were very plain tasting and came with regular yellow mustard. Not sure if they were suppose to be drizzled with honey or not. Not sure if yellow mustard is what they were suppose to come with.

Where things really fell apart was when we got to my Summer Harvest Salad with added Salmon. 

At this point I JUST SHUT DOWN and wanted to leave.

The salmon seemed like it was left-over and also over-cooked from days ago and was slightly re-heated. The salmon had albumin formation. It was like egg whites coming out of the over-cooked dry flesh. You can see this clearly in my photo.

My amazing sounding salad was also missing key ingredients that I was looking forward too.
The salad was missing 
Fiddlehead Ferns 
It had blueberries but didn't have the pickled blueberries in description 
missing candied sunflower seeds
Dressing was missing seasoning. It seemed like all it was made of something like cucumber water and sour cream with nothing else. You can see the dressing just looks watery and white with nothing in it from my photo.

My husband's plate really was ok. The plate looked beautiful. The pasta was made nicely. he thought the sausage could have used some seasoning. Plate might have been missing garlic chives.

The manager cleared our plates and when she took my plate she said that was a really great salad wasn't it? At that point I was still in shut down mode.....and didn't have it in me to bother her about the missing ingredients but I did mention the salmon that she didn't see because my husband bagged it up for our dogs.

After this experience I will never go back nor can I recommend.

I'm generously giving them two stars because my husbands meal was ok and all the front of house help I came in contact with seemed like they cared.

The problems are all kitchen 100%"}
{"text":"Breakfast is quite good with fresh ingredients.   Dinner was not as successful with overlooked fish and vegetables."}
{"text":"Love the food. Service S L O W. Waited for my check to close out forever. I hope they improve. Great food."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant during our Fiesta Bowl weekend with my wife. We had absolutely the BEST meal here. The hotel that this restaurant is a part of is immaculate, however we were unfortunately not staying there. We started off with an appetizer of Mole Meatballs that were so tender and delicious with the mole. We could have just had these and it would have been the highlight of the night. We finished both with grilled filets cooked exactly to our specs that were delicious. The only minor complaint was we did not care for our cocktails that we ordered. No way did that come close to dimming our 5-star review. Fantastic."}
{"text":"The Chef here has got it right! Fresh ingredients and good culinary vision. I really enjoyed my appetizers and the burger was amazing. Hats off to Chef Rick Dupere."}
{"text":"Certainly not what you expect from a resort. I was unimpressed with the grilled chicken avocado toast, the sandwich was hastily put together and it fell apart quickly. 

It's clear that you're paying a premium for the convenience of dining at the resort, not for premium level food. While service was polite, they appeared disorganized and hectic at a time when they were waiting 4-5 tables max. The experience and quality does not correlate with the pricing."}
{"text":"What can I say. It's mediocre in every way.
Service from an annoying loud waitress. Who couldn't get the order right.
A very strange menu, where everything comes out well done.
It is in a lovely resort though."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! ! Amy made our experience so fun. She is funny, attentive, and truly charming. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Scottsdale Resort and this is the main restaurant. I ate breakfast here twice and dinner once. Joseph was my server each time and he was fantastic. 

Dinner was a 5+. I got the weekly specials (Sun-Thurs). $19 for the special of the week and includes a beer or glass of wine. I had trout with a cream sauce, roasted veggies and wild rice. Served with a flatbread with caramelized onions and grilled tomatoes. 

Breakfasts were 3.5. Service was excellent as was the vanilla lattes. The main dishes are overpriced for breakfast and just not that great. Opt for the breakfast restaurant on the 3rd floor instead where the prices are a bit better and there is a buffet option."}
{"text":"Kitchen West provided me with the most AMAZING meal I had during my time in Scottsdale. First, the server, Amy, was an absolute doll. Describe to me your perfect server, friend, and dinner date and she's that wrapped all into one! She made restaurant dining feel homey! Second, Amy's recommendation (I never know what to get so I narrow it down and ask for help) was spot on! I told her I was hungry, had fish for lunch, and wanted something delicious. She suggested the flank and boy oh boy was it a treat! She made sure that the steak was cooked to perfection and double checked with me when she brought it over. I seriously wanted to lick the plate...it was that good! My boss got the salmon and she loved it. From what little pieces I could sneak, that was pretty delicious too! All in all, definitely check out kitchen West and ask for Amy!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner here! The atmosphere is great.  Very warm and inviting.

We were treated to a yummy flatbread that the restuarant offers instead of the traditional loaf or sliced bread.  The flatbread came with two jams that must both be tried!

I ordered the KW Smoked Brisket Burger for my entree.  I was surprised to find the burger had two patties and the brisket was sandwiched between them! The overall presentation was very well thought out on a board and the burger was served with roasted fingerling potatoes instead of plain old french fries.  It was a great touch to show just the right amount of extra effort to make the meal more upscale without making it over the top.

Our server was perfectly attentive without being overbearing and service was great from the first hello to the last goodbye.  This is definitely be a spot to go back to!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this was a let down. Watching a staff member scratch his beard, then his head, then dig in his ears several times before handling plates and delivering food to tables was a turn off for sure. The flat iron steak was good, pasta not so much. I think we will head to town for dinners the rest of our stay at McCormick Ranch."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, we did Groupon and paid extra for wine and child's meal for my 10 yr old son.
The hostess 'Aiko' was very helpful and wonderful, our server 'Jay' was really excellent, we will  come back to the restaurant , they have 'Happy Hours at bar 4-6pm.
Good service and good food and price."}
{"text":"Highly recommended: from the moment we arrived on the property we were impressed. The valet offered to plug my Tesla into their Tesla Destination Charger, which is a big deal to me!  Ummmm....  Yes. Please. And. Thank. You. The valets were super nice and very cool guys. 

Next, we joined some out of town friend's that were guests in the hotel for lunch. The inside was not too loud and our friends selected inside...  We were quickly seated at a nice spacious table. The waiter greeted us warmly and quickly began to take good care of our party.  The decor is clean, light and very tasteful. They have a nice glassed in wood fired cooking area for patrons to watch. 

The manager was a familiar face to our friend and they chatted. It turns out he is someone that has provided great service in years past. He was super nice and stopped by frequently to chit chat and check on us. 

The kids ordered off the children's menu...  1 cheese pizza and 1 macaroni and cheese. I always fear that it is crappy store box Mac and cheese and cardboard crusted pizza. Not the case. Their pizza looks like authentic pizza from Italy!  If you know what I'm talking about then you know what I'm talking about. There is a HUGE difference!  The Mac and cheese looked hand crafted and amazing without the Kraft looking orange glow!

The menu really features 1 main signature sandwich...  Bacon Brisket Cheeseburger. It is boxed off on the menu and for good reason!  3 of the 4 adults ordered their signature Bacon Brisket Cheeseburger....  It was everything we expected and much more!  I tried to order medium rare and was told by the waiter that they can only go medium or more done. Admittedly, I was a little apprehensive to order it this way as that typically means dry and tasteless as shoe leather. Not the case. The burger is definitely juicy and a great combination of flavored!!!! 

The only negative of our meal is that all 3 of the burger eaters order crispy potatoes and they were far from crispy. It's pretty common with restaurants to undercook potatoes even when ordered well done or crispy. 

The location works. Located on McCormick Ranch between Scottsdale Rd and Hayden Rd. They offer complimentary valet and for Tesla owners having a Tesla Destination Charger is icing on the cake. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 27th anniversary and searched out restaurants on Yelp.  The reviews for Kitchen West were positive so we decided to dine there for lunch.  We arrived around 11:00 a.m., just as they opened.  The host was very personable and wanted to make sure that we were seated in the perfect location.  We provided our input and he listened, seating us in a booth by the wall.  The menu options were intriguing and, after some deliberation, we ordered the Garden Burger as an entree which we would share and the mushroom flatbread dish as an appetizer. The food was scrumptious, the service was exceptional, and the ambiance was romantic.  To top it off, they gave us a box of locally-made chocolates as a gift for our anniversary.  All around, this was a five-star experience!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place after all of the glowing reviews. However, very disappointed. The scallops had no flavor, nor did the salmon. The sides were small and nothing special. The bread and tomato jam were the highlight of the meal, once we actually got it. It was supposed to be delivered while we were waiting for our meal, and we actually had asked for it near the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Second time hanging at the Bar Six40 connected to the restaurant. Great food, good drink and beer selection and very good service. Ryan is top notch as a bartender. He takes good care of his customers and is pleasant to interact with."}
{"text":"Amy ROCKS at the restaurant and at the bar. Great counsel and advice on  menu options. Life is short,,,, Ask for Amy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are Arizona locals and decided to do a short staycation. We had dinner in the restaurant, pretty good summer deal appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert for $50.00. Cheese curds with stone ground honey mustard kicked ass! We added buratta salad,  heirloom tomatoes, arugula and balsamic reduction, also very tasty. Entree 1was steak frite.  Skip this entree, basically steak and french fries with chimichurri liquid that tastes like medicine. Entree 2 was pork Chile verde with a papusa. ORDER THIS! Perfectly tender pork in a light Sonoran Chile verde sauce with some fresh corn. The papusa is like a potato cake but is a mix of ground white corn and cheeses. Crunchy and soft. Yum!

Now for the best part of our meal, our server AMY!! She had a ton of personality, was friendly and attentive and plain knew her shit. Speaking as a server/bartender myself I have to say I'm frequently dissapointed by service. AMY did not dissapoint. She seriously made our evening    fun and memorable. THANK YOU AMY, YOUR AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"I'm here on a business trip- was quickly seated at a two top along the back wall allowing me to sit on the comfy padded bench and view the beautiful room. My server, Amy, was hands down the best server and most efficient ever.  Service was quick but I was never rushed and it was fantastic!! 
The salmon is worth going back for over and over. Vanilla creme brûlée is amazing. Fresh flatbread with a cherry jam... I wish I had some of that to bring back to the room."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here.  Stephen, our waiter, was extremely attentive and was able to answer all of our questions about the menu.  I had the Everything Salad.  It was the perfect size with some unusual veggies.  (At least unusual to me) The bread was light and fresh with some great cherry preserves.  In the future I would like to try the brisket burger; it looked amazing."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and the food was fantastic. Ryan at the bar was extremely attentive and friendly. The food is reminiscent of what you would expect at an exclusive farm to table establishment. Well crafted, quality ingredients and plated perfectly."}
{"text":"Had a top notch lunch. The everything salad with salmon in top was simply delicious. And very fresh. There was even grilled corn cut up in there. The service is great and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! My wife and I decided to have an early supper. The dining area was closed, but we were able to dine in the bar. Andrew, the bartender, served as our waiter. My wife had the Traditional Burger and I had the KW Brisket Burger. Both came with roasted fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were delicately seasoned and very tasty. My burger was amazing. Two perfectly cooked patties, separated by a healthy layer of tender brisket, and topped off with pecan bacon. One of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Andrew did a great job juggling his duties, and the service was excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner ... if Amy is your server you will get a comedy show along with excellent service. Her recommendations and descriptions of the dishes were spot on. We enjoyed the salmon board and the generous portions of extremely fresh fish ( in the desert!). Dessert was fantastic ( carrot cake & creme brûlée). Food was very good but Any made it a memorable night."}
{"text":"Nice place! No need to go out if you are staying at the resort. Sundays through Thursdays specials - A lot of food for $19, comes with a free wine or beer!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on May 9, 2018.  We both had the chef's special Chilean Sea Bass; it was prepared perfectly.  Our server, Amy, was terrific, not only was she engaged, entertaining and fun, she was also very attentive, truly great service.  The food and wine prices were consistent with Scottsdale resort pricing, so moderate tending to upper pricing, but we had a coupon which gave us some benefit including 15% off a bottle of wine.  We will add this to our places to go back to, primarily because of the great table service by our server Amy."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was delicious. It's a nice little restaurant inside this lovely hotel resort. We actually had a Groupon so I can't objectively talk about the value other than to say I don't know how I would've felt if I'd had to pay full price for it. But forgetting that, Amy was our waitress and she was flawless. It was such a breath of fresh air to be served by somebody who clearly loves their job, loves the food, loves working there. We started with the delicious salad with roasted corn and chicken and vegetables. The house ranch is delish. We split the scallops and the skirt steak. Both were wonderful. The only part of the meal that didn't really exceed our expectations was the desert. It was a peach cobbler and it was just OK. Overall, I absolutely would go there again. Hopefully, I wouldn't be paying. :-)"}
{"text":"So disapointing. Decided to go out for a special birthday dinner. Menu was very limited. Waitress brought us wrong appetizer.  Herb rice served with fish was mushy mess with no flavor. I did complain about that. Chef agreed and threw out whole batch afterward. Gave me extra veggies instead. Ordered cobbler of the day told it was three berry. When waitress delivered it, said \"I guess it's apple\"  (turned out to be peach.) Check was wrong, waitress quoted us wrong price on special offer. Only thing positive was all the ingredients were fresh, you could tell a lot of work went into that at least. Waitress was pleasant and capable so my dinner guest and I didn't complain but I did leave restaurant feeling  dissatisfied."}
