{"text":"Best sandwich made fresh not subway fresh , fresh fresh, this is my favorite sandwich place , soooooo good and no guilt involved because it's not junk food!"}
{"text":"I like the service at this Dagwoods. The sandwiches are always good, just my opinion but they taste less processed than  at subway to me. I love the Dagwoods sauce."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot better than the Subway down the street, but the sandwiches are kind of dinky in comparison. They're on these little, absurdly thin pseudo-baguettes (which also means they fall apart very easily). The meat is high-quality and sliced thin, and the Dagwood's sauce is nice (especially the spicy version). Cookies are okay, not as sinfully delicious as those of the bigger fast-food giants but they get the job done. Chili is a nice addition. Service is on-the-ball and always welcoming. I'd say Subway for when you just need to stuff your face, Dagwood's for everything else."}
{"text":"I really like this place - The atmosphere is really quiet and mellow.  I just went for lunch today, and sat on the tables outside and read a book.  The staff is super friendly and the prices aren't bad either.  I forgot the name of it - but the sandwich included mesquite chicken, provolone cheese, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, mushrooms, and mayo on a herb focaccia bread - heated.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Worker constantly talking on phone or with friends instead of working.  She makes you feel like you are an inconvenience to serve.  Slow service and only works on one order at a time, very inefficient.  Food is mediocre.  Feels like the kind of placed you are forced to eat at because of no other options.  There IS a much better option in building next door.  WAY better.  Better food, terrific service."}
{"text":"Best service ,the staff are really nice. Better than subway great place near the bus station and easy to find."}
{"text":"Vendredi 29 mars 2013 Un petit coin caché dans un centre commercial, tout près du ToysRus de Brossard, dissimule Dagwoods, un petit comptoir à sandwich similaire à Subway et à Quizno's. La comparaison s'arrête là. Malheureusement, on vous sert 2 transches de viandes (1 millimètre d'épaisseur) dans un petit sandwich, lorsque vous choississez le petit format. Même si tout est transché directement à partir de la pièce de viande de charcuterie, on ne vous sert que quelques menus morceaux de viandes dans une garniture très ample de salade et légumes au choix, comme chez Subway et Quizno's. On vous charge 4,69 $ + taxes pour le petit sandwich (6 pouces). Une chance que j'ai utilisé un coupon moitié prix ! Et parlons-en des coupons... les employés ne sont pratiquement pas au courant des coupons en vigueur. Il faut donc le mentionner. Même si l'accueil au comptoir est très bien on en resort déçu et on préfère aller chez Quizno's et Subway pour en avoir pour notre argent. Devons-nous y retourner ? Laissez tomber, ça ne vaut pas la peine d'y retourner !  J'ai jeté les coupons qu'il me restait !  Friday march 29th 2013 A small hidden place inside a commercial center parking, near Brossard's ToyRus, conceals Dagwoods, a small sandwich counter very similar to Subway and Quizno's. The comparison stops right here. Unfortunately, they serve you 2 small meat slices (1 millimeter thick) inside a small sandwich (6 inches), if you choose the small size. Even if they slice it directly in front of you from the meat roll it is still 2 slices of tiny small meat garnished with a LOT of salad and vegetables of your choice, just like Subway and Quizno's. They charge you 4,69 $ + taxes a small sandwich. Fortunately I had my 2 for 1 coupon ! And talking about coupons, the staff knows almost nothing about those coupons and their validity, they still have to read it again and again. So you have to say it before you order. Even with a friendly reception from the staff you still get out of there and run all the way to Subway and Quizno's to get it more for your money. Bottom line is : forget it, it's useless, you don't have to go back. I threw away my leftover coupons !"}
{"text":"I am now upping my rating to \"YAY! I'm a Fan!\" because the service is better. Who knows how long that will last, but I've been there recently and the two girls working were really nice.   Whoever is hiring now is doing the right thing.... so far."}
{"text":"My lunch spot for past few years and I have to say only Wow how awesome and tasty food over here !!! Always fresh ingredients and best service"}
{"text":"Simple, no frills deli inside an office building.  They have a special everyday, which is usually a pretty good value.  My go-to sandwich is the Italian.  The people who work there are always very nice.  They have several tables in the dining area, with a TV thats always on CNN."}
