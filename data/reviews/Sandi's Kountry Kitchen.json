{"text":"We live in central NH but travel frequently. We found a \"GEM\" in upstate NY called Sandi's Kountry Kitchen in Mooers, NY. We always make sure that no matter what we order it is accompanied with French fries which are out of this world. The staff (Jana and Grant) are friendly and make the experience a real pleasure. Food is delicious, plentiful and priced reasonably. We stop when ever in the area (not only for the food but also the staff).  Walter"}
{"text":"Great French toast!  Massive chocolate chip pancakes the size of the plate and super friendly service.  Loads of food for under $10.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I must say that the ladies behind the counter are amazing and so is Jeremy the cook. The food was excellent! The French Toast was great along with the homemade toast. By far one of the best diners the north country has to offer! I would highly recommend paying them a visit!"}
{"text":"A very traditional little family restaurant on the highway at Mooers, NY. Found this while traveling one day - it's in a long stretch of highway with few other places to stop for food - and was delighted. Now it's a regular stop.  Great breakfasts, good grill food (burgers, fries, club sandwiches), daily specials, good coffee.  Most of the customers know each other and the waiting staff - guess it's used a lot by locals; but as visitors passing through we always feel welcome.  Looking forward to stopping there again when passing through this year."}
{"text":"We were traveling from Montreal to Vermont and decided to grab a bite to eat. Where else do we find food - Yelp!! The 5 star rating is well deserved! Quaint country atmosphere with 50's decor and 90's music! Our waitress, Wanda, was very friendly and gave exceptional service. I had the fried shrimp, homemade French fried, coleslaw and a roll. The shrimp was fried perfectly, the fries were great and plentiful! I was enamored by the pie selection and decided not to eat the roll. I had the homemade maple pie for dessert - sooo good!! My husband had the liver, onions and bacon; he raved about how good it tasted! The two other travelers had a hamburger and chopped steak; perfectly cooked and delicious! One had the homemade butterscotch pie which didn't survive long as she said it too was delicious! The reasonable prices and excellent food was well worth the 14 mile detour."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our motorcycle trip to Alexandria Bay. What a nice place! If you're going to a place strictly by looks you'll pass a good meal. Friendly waitress, great omelette freshly made toast and home fries that mom couldn't make better herself!!! Throughly enjoyed this meal. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in upstate NY! The service is friendly, food is delicious, portions are huge, and prices are fair! I've enjoyed several meals here while in the area."}
