{"text":"As an Afghan I rarely go out to eat my cultures food. I have eaten at a few famous afghan restaurants with my friends such as Bamiyan kabob but the food at these restaurants did not taste like a true afghan experience, the kabob was tasteless. The other night I went to Watan kabob with a few friends who were craving the food so I searched for an afghan restaurant and was directed to Watan kabob. The food at this place is way more tastier than any other afghan restaurant, the meat was fresh and well marinated. I highly recommend Anyone to taste real afghan food at Watan kabob."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I love Afghani food and Watan didn't disappoint. I prefer it to Bamiyah Kabob actually - although that place is good too.  Everything is made fresh to order, the meat was perfectly cooked and the hot sauce was incredible. The naan bread was amazing, soft and warm. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I will go out of my way to get my food from Watan Kabob.  We often order the chicken breast kabob or the tandoori kabob, sometimes the fish.  Aromatic, delicious seasoning on the meat.  You get a lot of food, that's for sure.  I will usually order the salad and naan version and that's more than enough for one person, if you don't want to have extra carbs (rice) you get with the plate version.  You can call ahead for pick-up or if you have time, there's a good amount of seating available.  Good vibe from the customers, lots of big families, groups of friends, plenty of great energy.  Note that it can get a little cold in there during the fall and winter.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"That's actually my best restaurant so far in GTA Food quality is the best, service is not so good"}
{"text":"Food is scrumptious! This is a great place for families. Rather no-frills but for some reason this does not bother me all that much."}
{"text":"Great food! The Tandoori kabob had lovely seasonings. The best were the rice and the naan, which I highly recommend, except to dieters. The food was obviously fresh, and was plentiful. The ambiance is fancy cafeteria style. The only thing missing are side order vegetables."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait. After 30 mins of waiting they said they forgot my order. Food is good but they need to be better organized."}
{"text":"This place used to be a best afghan food dine-in in town but recently they have remarkably reduced the standard meal size specially kobobs despite 10-15% recent price increase."}
{"text":"After a couple visits, I think Watan Kabob has become my go-to for Afghan food.   The food is always fresh, the portions are big, and the prices are reasonable.   I have tried the Tandoori Kabob, Chicken Breast Kabob, and Chaplee Kabob. My favourite is definitely the Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you aren't looking for something spicy. As for the Chaplee Kabob, it was my first time trying this dish. I liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was quite oily...  The salad is always fresh and I love the Afghani bread (especially dipped in both the sauces). For about $2 more, you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice.   Watan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter, then wait until your number is called.   It can be quite busy, even on a weeknight, packed with families and children playing hide-and-seek behind you.   Watan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob (I read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there). However, it differs from a restaurant with waiter service, an extensive menu, and more comfortable seating, like Paramount. Unfortunately, Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers, but I enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced. The only reason I would return to Paramount is for their appetizers, manakeesh, and baklawa."}
{"text":"I was initially skeptical of this place, but the positive raves were quite reassuring. The food is absolutely phenomenal. The portion sizes are huge!! So make sure you bring a big appetite.   As compared to bamiyan in Mississauga, I think the quality and quantity are both better. The naan is softer and better too.   The downside: be prepared to wait for a while. But as they say...good things come to  those who are patient!  Overall, it's a must try if you like Afghani food. It's definitely a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Pathetic customer service, even kitchen was very messy and unhygienic. I had very bad experience, and would not recommend anybody to visit and eat.   I would give them zero in customer services, and three out of ten in food quality. Overall it is a zero rating restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a regular to Bamiyan but I was told about other Afghan restaurants opening up in recent years. Firstly the place is designed slightly more like restaurant than Bamiyan that feels like a fast food. But only slightly the place is brightly lit which makes it a bit uncomfortable.  The place is clean and there is a slight opening to the back kitchen. Something's that make it better here is the television and the ordering system that displays the next order, but it does nothing for the ambiance.  The food was excellent except for the kofta which was chewy and slightly tasteless compared to the tandoori chicken. Bread was hot but Bamiyan's is better, the tandoori chicken was the same but I think they give more here. I prefer Bamiyan's rice but the rice here has less oil. Salad has cucumbers which is nice and they give a lot of the dressing on the side.  The place is good very comparable to Bamiyan I am not sure what I like better. But I could definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I simply can't get enough of that place, I go there once every two weeks, I've had everything at the menu and I'm still craving for more, The rice is smooth as silk, The way the chicken is marinated is unbelievable, there's a twist that's unexplainable, how can I forget about the filet mignon... All I got to say is that if you've never had Afghan food you will now! Enjoy"}
{"text":"One word, shitty! Rude staff, it is an insult to Afghan traditional food. Over cooked rice and kabobs hard as rock.  I ordered Kabobs and I could barley bite into to it. It was not marinate at all. Asked for chicken and they made me wait for 45 minutes.  Staff eating food at the kitchen and they ate the kabobs in front of me and on purpose made me wait. I would not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"I accidentally stumbled on this restaurant because I saw sooo many peope inside it, I decided to try it.  I was staying at a Toronto Canada airport hotel, for a friend's wedding. There I accidentally  stumbled upon Watan Kabob. All I can say is amazing amazing !!!!!!!!!  Lamb excellent. Chicken excellent.  Beef  excellent. I wish they cooked more dishes like chicken biryani.... come on guys even Gordon Freaking Ramsay can do Biryani you can too!   Atmophere Generally clean, and proper.  But, it can get really dirty in high traffic, so the management has to ............\"work\"  on that a little bit but  4.5 stars out of 5 ! Excellent work."}
{"text":"Very happy that I came here! Food was awesome, portions are very large so you might want to share. The wait is a bit long, but it's alright when it comes to fresh tasty food. I recommend the tandoori platter, which comes with a side of rice and salad. The naan bread is very soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Just came out of the place, decent food but horrible customer service. An amazingly unorganized place that should be anything but, given the volume of customers that the serve. My first order was okay but the second order incurred an almost 30 minute wait and after inquiring found out that they had forgotten the order or that it was part served. I had to show them receipts for both orders to convince them that we had not received the order. When the second order came, it was incorrect - why was I not surprised!   The cashier was saying she couldn't do anything and if she went back, her manager would be upset. Not my issue if you incorrectly place an order. After much insistence, the order was changed and when she brought the order to table, it was missing stuff and when asked she suggested that it was given before. We had enough, packed the stuff and walked out. Never visiting this place again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Mississauga, possible the whole GTA! Amazing quality, affordable prices, they understand food and take your dining experience to a whole new level. Hopefully it will stay that way because I don't know where else I would find spectacular food!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! We went on a Sunday night and it was so packed that we had a hard time getting a table. The wait was definitely worth it though because the food was amazing.  I tried their wazeri platter which is grilled chicken, beef kafta kabab and rice. I substituted the rice for qabuli pulao and it was amazing!  This was one of the best afghani food restaurants I've ever been to! The food tasted authentic and fresh. I would definitely recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Visited Watan Kabab today for take out, got the Bolani, Tandoori chicken and Chaplee kabab. Had to wait for around 15minutes since it was lunch time and we had not ordered in advance. But the food was very good, tasty, fresh and the quantity was good too.  Staff are helpful and while we were waiting, I overheard them assist a group of three who were not familiar with the food and trying the place for the first time. The staff recommended dishes based on each persons individual preference, good customer service for sure. Will definitely visit again and plan on trying some of the fish dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The meats are wonderfully grilled and salads are fantastic. Bread is alwaya warm and fresh!"}
{"text":"I was the 3rd and I took my entire family, the best Afghani restaurant I have ever been to. The food was fresh and made right when I ordered it, the bread was right out of the oven, and the dough drink was sooooo good! :) Over all I recommend this place to everyone even if you have not tried afghani food."}
{"text":"Excellent. I've been coming here for years when I'm in the area. Everything is fresh and delicious. Don't expect a quick lunch though, because they start grilling when you order."}
{"text":"Decent Kabob, better than Bamiyan in my opinion.  Ordered over the phone. Came in and it was on time."}
{"text":"Very nice kofta kabob. Fries are nice and hand made. Spices are delicious. Overall, a wonderful restaurant"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Bamiyan Kabob on Dixie Road. Watan is very similar. The menus are almost the same. I had the Tandoori chicken kabob dinner without the rice. The chicken was superb and even the naan came out hot.   The staff was very friendly and for a place only open 3 days it was reasonably busy for a Saturday afternoon. I found the prices reasonable.   I will return to try some of their other dishes in the near future. Looking forward to the Boulagnee."}
{"text":"I would give them 0/5. First of all, their prices are wrong online. I told the cashier but she didn't seem to care. I would say now with their price changes, it's way over priced! 2) Service is terrible. Just go to Bamiyan instead! Not only is their customer service and food excellent, but they are WELL organized! We phone ordered our order 30mins ahead for Watan Kabab. We got there and still had to wait a long time. My husband kept asking the guy who was passing out the orders and he kept IGNORING him. An argument happened and the employee was VERY RUDE. He used foul language (The F word!). The \"owner\" didn't seem to care how his employees behaved. It's a shame that they don't hesitate to give crappy and rude customer service. Non-halal places give better customer service. Such a shame!! Owner told us to leave and while we were doing that, despite it was quite quiet at the moment (because of the argument), one of the employees literally screamed out \"next\" very loud! Smh! I won't be surprised if one day they wake up to find that they are short on customers! I guess they have toooo many customers that they forgot the key to a long-lasting business! So many other Afghan restaurants out there to go to that serve the same food such as Bamiyan (many locations), Afghan Kabab (on Islington ave), and etc"}
{"text":"Worst food today!!!! I had ordered their food previously and it was good but this time food was very bad.....it was RAW and chaplee kabobs were very hard!!!! I had to give the chicken skrewer and the kabobs to my dog who no doubt liked it! Will never go to this place again! Wastage of money!!!"}
{"text":"The service was fast. The food was delicious. Consistent. Love their chicken skewers flavourful.  Clean overall."}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced!  We were traveling from out of town,and relying on Yelp reviews to help us find something decent.  This was a great place!  The service was friendly and the food was wonderful.  My whole family loved it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for the 2nd time yesterday. The place was still nice and clean and the people working there are easy going. The food was good overall and always fresh. This place should be tried by anyone who enjoys Afghan food and wants to have a big meal. Their dinner entree is good for one person and comes with a big naan (bread). If you are hungry and want to fill up for around $10-12 then this is the right place. I just wish they showed something other than news on their Tvs lol."}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh healthy and good prices. Only problem inside is cold in the winter. Restaurant not heated well. If you haven't tried bamiyan kabob restaurant try it too,it's similar."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Chaplee kebabs are delicious, beef tikka is great, the rice with carrot and raisins is delicious.  The bread is made fresh and is delicious.  Great for dinner or lunch.  They can make wraps if you want smaller portions or salad and nan combo of you don't want too much rice.  It's made fresh to order and if possible try to order in advance if you're picking up.  The wait is around 20-30 mins so ordering in advance is a must if it's a quick work lunch.  The customer service could be better (i.e. Giving utensils without having to ask for them, clearing the table before you) but they are very busy and do their best.  They forgot an item when I picked it up and when I noticed when I got home we called and they told us to mention it when we came next time for a refund or to get it next time.  Would have been nice if they did a little more for the inconvenience.  I've been here dozens of times and will continue to be a regular as long as they can keep it up the food quality/taste."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place for over a year. The food is good, portions are big and the price is affordable."}
{"text":"Order screwup, delayed arrival of food. Ordered Chicken Kofta wrap. Very average taste and quality. Some part of chicken was uncooked. I don't think I'll come again. I found Bamiyan better than this one."}
{"text":"My go-to Afghan kabob place. It is clean, the decor is beautiful and the good is delicious. Although the servers could be friendlier, they work super hard and always do exactly as you ask.   I always order the chicken which is delicious, and not dry like most conventional afghan kabob restaurants'. The fish is a really underrated part of the menu- I tried the spicy fish on a whim the other day and it was delusions! So soft and perfectly spiced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good food and liked they accept credit card. I think I might not go again to Bamiyan as Bamiyan only takes cash and debit."}
{"text":"I started coming here since they first opened and it's always fresh and yummy. My favorite is the Tandoori Chicken Dinner. I always recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"One of the great kabob places in Mississauga.  Everyone I brought to this place for the first time loves the tandoori kabob.    Overall this is a great afgan place,  I go for the salad and Naan more than enough and all for $11.00"}
{"text":"Watan Kabob is a hidden gem.  Food is always consistently good, whether it's the tandoori, BBQ chicken breast, lamb shank or just kofta kabobs.  They're usually really busy so come early!  The place has recently been renovated and expanded and the food hasn't changed as a result.  They have amazing bread thats cooked fresh when you order.  Highly recommended...I go here at least 3-4 times a month!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and was totally worth going to!  The food was delicious and the portions were huge.  I had the Tandoori Fish with the red seasoning, it's was spicy but perfect for me!  My friend had the Lamb shank with rice. The Lamb was amazingly tender and mouth watering.  Will for sure be returning there to try different things on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here. Hands down best Afghan food!! Customer service is great too."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good even it's a kinda fast food place. Naan was so so, I ordered steak and kofta combo which turned out very delicious. Juicy and tender."}
{"text":"Being a vegeterian I ordered Bolani and Ferni (the dessert) and I loved it. Not only me, even my husband who ordered the fish tandoori enjoyed the bolani and ferni more than his fish. The food is fresh, well prepared, suffice quantity and priced right.   I look forward to visiting this place again. Although I would be elated to see some vegeterian or paneer kaboobs on the menu"}
{"text":"This food is delicious. So flavorful and cooked to perfection. I had the fish and salad combo with Naan bread. I discovered this restaurant while on my way to Mandarine, and thought I'd try it. And boy am I glad that I did! I will drive out of my way from my home in Toronto to visit this place. It was a really good find."}
{"text":"Seriously!!! Isn't it enough to say that this place has a lineup all hours of the day and mind you there are four cash registers to take orders and a manual electronic order taking station. Every time I eat here, about 10 times now, (I've only tried the chicken breast kabob and the tandoori kabob) the chicken is consistently tasty and moist and a big portion, the salad is average and the naan is huge and always freshly made. It comes with 2 sauces, a tomato based looking salsa and a white sauce, this white sauce is key, I always double up on the white sauce, it's soooo good!! Think of it like a szatziki for your chicken but so much better.  The staff is average, cause one time I came for a pick up, they gave my order to someone else that drove away and had to be called back so I can get it. They should have offered me a new one instead of wait the 15 minutes to get my order back, and this only happened once. Word of advice tho, make sure to call in advance for pickups, it's usually a 20 minute wait if you order at the counter.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The Tandori chicken was excellent, with fresh hot naan.  Definite good place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"The restaurant my family comes to all the time. Whenever we can't decide where to eat, Watan is where we go. It is essentially the same as all the other places like bamiyan, Kandahar, pamier, etc. What watan does really well is their quick service, ample seating, consistency in terms of quality and quantity, and overall just good tasting food. It used to be quite cheap, but the prices have gone up slightly, but still a great deal for the amount of food you get. I eat a lot and I am comfortable sharing a dinner order with another person. If you like chicken with spices, definitely get the half chicken dinner. If you love beef, definitely recommend the sultani dinner. It comes with pieces of burg or filet mignon and it's amazing. Definitely make sure you get the white sauce as well. If wanting to try something new, I'd recommend boulani and the Kheer. Not for everyone but I tend to like it. Each dinner costs about 13 dollars, but 3 people can comfortably eat with 2 dinners if sharing is your thing."}
{"text":"I came here with a colleague for lunch today. As soon as you walk in, you smell the delicious meat aromas. I'm not sure vegans would enjoy the fragrance, but for omnivores, it's a truly scrumptious smell.   I tried the beef kofta with salad and naan. You order and pay at the register and your number is on your receipt. Pay attention to the numbers being called because I noticed that they weren't necessarily going in chronological order.   The beef kofta (you get two) were juicy and flavourful. The salad was decent, but a bit skimpy. There was a little bit of lettuce with some diced tomatoes and onions. My colleague who ordered a \"dinner\" which comes with salad, rice, and naan got far more salad than I did which seems odd since mine was the \"salad\" option. They forgot my naan, but my colleague told me not to worry about it since she'd split hers with me. The naan is not like soft traditional Indian naan. This was kind of hard and crispy. Like a cross between a flatbread and a cracker.   The red spicy tomato-based sauce on the side was delicious. As others have noted, it's like a liquidy, spicy pico de gallo. Perfection.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Awesome taste n meal size...jus perfect..nothing much to say...variety is same as any other afghani food place like bamiyaan however i found the food portion big here..keep up the good work"}
{"text":"A decent family place. Food is declious, quantity is good too. I enjoy there sometimes going there to grab quick wrap for lunch or with family for dinner. Each time  experience  is good. I highly recommend to visit atleast once."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times. Quality and freshness of food was always consistent and very reasonably priced. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Watan kebab is one of the places which I don't know how to judge the food is amazing but the place is never clean it's always food on the table no one cleans This time I went and there you go again no one is cleaning the place proper  The restaurant was not as full with customers as always this is the reason why it should be cleaner but no empty tables and food on it. I  think they should clean the place more often. The cleaning staff was talking to friends instead of cleaning the tables. I would go next time for take out  The food is amazing I love to eating tandoori fish there it's the best. I ordered half chicken too but oh boy it was sooooo Dry and hard like a stone I should have given it back!!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful restaurant with great food! such flavourful, juicy cuts of meat that are seasoned and flame grilled to perfection! As the food is made fresh to order the wait was reasonable and worth every minute. We ordered the Tandoori Wazeri dinner plate with rice, salad and naan and another plate of Barg kabab with just salad and naan. The naan is TO DIE FOR!! Super soft and crispy around the edges bread that will make you want to order some to go!! FYI the portions are very generous so come hungry! Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Watam is Hum Watan if you know what mean! its freaking great. I love the chapli kebabs I get them every time I go.   The meals are great for the price you would pay as you always will have to take some home, the portions are big. With the diner meal you get rice, naan, meat you order, salad and 2 sauces (white and red).  The restaurant is not bad as there is far bit amount of tables for people to sit around and is not cramped. It's part of a plaza so there is plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"I echo the reviews I read. Decent food, with nice flavours and good quantity. Service was poor.  We had some food to take home and was great left over.  Their system for service is so disorganized and people did not know which order was theirs. They forgot part of my order. The owner really needs to change this, it's diminishing an otherwise good place to eat."}
{"text":"FAST. FRESH. CHEAP. HEALTHY. And so good. What more can I ask for?  My love for Watan Kabob, goes without saying. This place serves some of the freshest, and tastiest afghan food - in giant portions, and cheap too!  In the past year, it has defaulted into one of our go-to takeouts, and it has yet to disappoint.  You`ll notice right away, at any given time of day, any day of the week, these guys are BUSY. Both cash registers are usually manned, and they have a screen, that will show which order# is being served. Everything is A LOT quicker than it looks. Don't let the lengthy lines and crowds, turn you away!  My usuals consist of the 'Kofta (ground beef kabobs) dinner' or the 'Chaplee dinner'. Nothing ever comes dry, the food in taste and quality is always consistent. The sauce they give you, is never enough. Ask for more!  Whatever you choose, the portions are big enough to happily satisfy you. Their dinner comes with either rice, salad and naan. You can also opt out of rice & get just naan & salad.   Their Qabulee rice (rice with carrots & raisins), are a nice switch up, but the rice that comes with the dinners are far from bland! The Naan, believed to be cooked in a tandoor clay over, IS SO FREAKING GOOD. It always comes fresh & warm - crisp but SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY on the inside. Mmmmm.  Service is what it is; quick, not much interaction. The atmosphere is super casual, with some long tables, but plenty of space for groups.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My family's usual kabob spot is Bamiyan but we thought we'd give Watan a try.   The girl who took out order was either having a really bad day or hates her job.. I almost felt bad for ordering!! She did not want any of it!!  We got the Chaplee kabob and barg kabob, both dinners. A dinner comes with a naan, rice and salad. We waited about 20 minutes for only 2 orders.   Barg: way too overcooked. The meat was so chewy it felt like marinated rubber.   Chaplee: tasty and spicy.   The extra plates and take out containers are off to the side of the counter so it's easy for customers to grab however many of whatever they want.   Also, the screeching sound of the chairs being pulled or tucked in are enough to make you ears bleed. Management should definitely look into fixing that issue. It really dampers the mood for customers dining in.   Overall, it's a no-no for me and my family. If you want excellent Afghan kabob go to Bamiyan or Naan and Kabob! Great quality food."}
{"text":"Their Firni is off the charts!! I usually order their waziri Kabab or choppan Kabab(lamb chops). Their choppan Kabab was nicely grilled the first time I went but the second time I noticed some white fat still not fully cooked/dissolved, I still ate it though. I'd ask them to cook it well done next time. I'm not a fan of their chicken Kabab's since they lack flavour IMO. Their red meat dishes seem to be well seasoned."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Once went with my wife back in 2016 summer. Generally identical in taste to most of the afghani grills. Girls on the counter are rude and non friendly. While eating the rice, found out worm inside the lettuce. Counter was informed immediately and guy started seeing it surprisingly as he's seen worm for the very first time in his life. Owner was called, but staff reluctant to call him. But finally he came and then compensated for that. Owner was a decent man paying us the apology and ordered the food again for us. But my wife was quite shaky to eat again. Honestly might be very difficult to wash out the green leaves in the bulk which was the cause."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with Watan, totally turned me off, I took my mother in law and wife for lunch to Watan, we get there and order, I ordered to Two kabob plate with salads, one order of Sultani with rice for me, A skewer of kabob, and one order of Bolani, after processing the order when I went back to pay for a drink, the girl at the counter stated \"they do not have Bolani any more\" I asked is it off the Menu? She stated  \"no just today\" So I am like okay can you refund me, and she did, we waited 40 minutes, many people got served, we thought maybe they phoned ordered to eat in or something  Then I got up and waited to place order for two more takeout dinners, for family at home So I am like I would like to order some takeout, but I am scared, because we are still waiting for the order for here. The same girl asked what our order number was. then did back and forth with the kitchen, and started to speak in Arabic, but I could tell by the tone that this was going me make very annoyed, what she is about to tell me. She did something with the order when she refunded me for the Bolani, and the Back  ( kitchen ) never prepared my order., the chit never printed or was not handed to the back. Not a single apology!  I am beyond annoyed at this point, we were starving by then. At last one guy comes from the back sees our receipt, acknowledges that it has been way too long, my exact order was ready, but I guess it was for someone else, but he grabbed it from the girl's hand, & he is like \"start with this\".  Now a gentleman comes from behind, and asks if the order was his. The girl goes yes, go ahead, like whoa! Is she asleep? The chef just told me to start with this. Now he is looking at me. Awkward as it can be, he is like is this your order? because he heard the whole conversation, I am like just take it.   Then we waited for 15 more minutes, our food arrived with 2 comp puddings (that I could not careless about, but the pudding was damn good)   NOTE TO THE OWNER:  PLEASE TRAIN YOUR STAFF, also train them to apologize first and foremost, and then offer to comp the food, by giving pudding away without speaking to the customer does not solve anything. The girl at the counter had a horrible attitude, Nobody from the counter realized that a table was sitting and waiting without any food for 45 minutes? Nobody cares? It boggles my mind!   If you are not in the business to make your customers HAPPY, by compensating them for a blunder your staff made , at least APOLOGIES!!!  trust me it WORKS.  PS. I was not looking for free food, spent around $80 bucks or more ! it's the thought and correcting an error properly what counts.  Folks but there is hope for Afghani kabob in Mississauga, just do a search on yelp, and yes I am been to most of them   Keep on Yelping*"}
{"text":"Great Afghani food option. They have the largest menu and the Tandoori plate is really good."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch twice, and both times the food was incredible! I tried their chicken, lamb, and beef. Everything was cooked perfectly, so tender and moist, and seasoned so well that I could save my dipping sauces for the bread.  Their \"fresh lemonade\" was very tasty too, but it can take them a long time to make if they're busy taking other orders."}
{"text":"I found this place by dumb luck.  I should have turned left and ended up turning right and saw a sign for Afghan food \"Score!\"  The customer service was well below standard with the gal working the counter being very stand offish, however, I went in with the goal to try the food so I stayed. I ordered the combo with a skewer of cubed chicken and s skewer of kafta along with a salad and fresh naan.   The meat was very good and not dried out as I normally experience (definitely enough food for me to have leftovers). The salad was good; lettuce and veg with a light dressing. But the best part of the meal was the naan. It was fresh, hot and very tasty.  I would definitely go back for the naan."}
{"text":"I came here with two of my friends. At first I was a bit skeptic because it was my first time trying afghani cuisine. This place has great tasting food and everything here is fresh and right off the grill. I ordered the Wazeri kabob (chicken breast and 1 kofta kabob skewer) which comes with rice, salad and fresh naan bread. The marination on the skewers was really good alongside the spices. Rice isn't anything special but the Naan Bread taste absolutely amazing. Next time I plan to try something from their wrap menu!"}
{"text":"Rating: The food rating is a 5*.   This restaurant always takes me to my happy place. I have yet to find a better place that does Kabobs as well as this one in the GTA.   We came on Easter Sunday for lunch and as always, this place was busy. This restaurant is located in the Burger King and Mandarin plaza in the corner of Hurontario and Matheson. There's plenty of parking available even if it's busy. Similar to other Kabobs places, it's a cafeteria style in which you order and pay first, and then pick up your order. First come, first serve in terms of seating. There's sufficient amount of seating but it can get tight when it's busy. The good thing is that there's three registers serving customers.   The Good: The food is on point. In terms of taste, there's no equal. We had the Tandoori Chicken, Beef Tikka and the Wazeri. All dinner size along with the Naan. Big serving portion and the Naan was hot and delicious. There's a jar of tap water available along with cups if you don't want to get drinks. They give you the tzatzaki sauce but ask for the hot one too. It's not really hot.   The Bad: The waiting is a minimum of 20-25 minutes. Also picking up your order is a bit hectic as the orders do not come in the order of your number. As soon as the food is done, your number gets called. So people who placed their order later might get their food before you.   Overall, that's a small price to pay for some amazing Kabobs.   Highly recommended!   P.S.  They have another location now and it's supposed to be bigger.  #51 of 2018"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and was really impressed. The restaurant looks like a simple, fast food, takeout type of restaurant. If you go, you will be miraculously surprised.   The restaurant smells amazing and the prices are really good! All of the food is cooked fresh each day so you are always getting high-quality product.   I ordered the chicken kabob salad and the chicken was so tender. The chicken was scrumptious and it was marinated perfectly. The salad was also really good. I used the spicy salsa that they provided as my salad dressing and decided to use it as a dip for my chicken. It was delicious.  It reminded me of is a pico de gallo sauce (it might be spicy for some) and the flavours mixed with my meal perfectly.   My friend added an order or rice to his chicken meal combo and the rice was really good as well. I tried it and it had a great flavoured.   We also ordered tea to drink with our meal and it was really good. We both ordered green tea and it had a very unique taste. The restaurant had added cardamom, which made the tea have a special je ne sais quoi.   I would definitely go back to try more dishes. Now, If only this restaurant was located near me"}
{"text":"I went Watan kabob 2 nd time and ordered lamb shank dinner and chicken qorma. The shank was not hot and fresh. Seemed like they micro waved it. And I saw them putting qorma in micro wave.  The lamb shank dinner didn't even come with salad. I would never go back to this dirty place.  But if you guys wanna have good afghani food then go to Chopan grill on qew & Erin mills. A lot better food and ambience.   WATAN KABOB SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable but the wait time was too long. There's lots of room for seating which is great. There were a couple cashiers who did not smile at all.  The food is good in comparison to places like Bamiyan Kabob and Naan & Kabob. I got the Tandoori Chicken. We found a small hair in the rice which has put me off on this place. I will not likely return to Watan Kabob."}
{"text":"Who knew Afghan food tasted so good?   For lunch I got the chicken wrap from here and it's delicious. The portion size is big so you will definitely get full from just the wrap. They give you big chunks of chicken and salad. The chicken was juicy and moist. They can also make it spicy, which adds a nice kick to it. The price is decent for lunch under $10.  The naan bread is soft and delicious. I'll definitely be back for more. The food reminds me of Mediterranean food with the kebabs and naan bread."}
{"text":"So I went to Watan Kabob recently with my parents.  We had takeout.  My dad had been here previously and told us that the portions are huge, so we ordered 2 portions of the Beef Tikka Kabob Dinner for the 3 of us ($9.49 each portion).  It was delicious and we had lots leftover.  So the dinner consisted of several pieces of beef, rice, salad and Afghan bread.  It was so tasty.  The beef was tender and flavourful.  The rice is basmati rice, but the grains are much longer than I've ever seen in my life.  The rice is also seasoned nicely.  The salad is actually 2 types of \"salad\" a diced tomato salad and an iceberg lettuce salad.  Not all that tasty but a nice accompaniment to the meal.  The Afghan bread (called naan, but very different from Indian naan) is a teardrop shaped flat bread that it not oily or buttery.  They sprinkle some sesame seeds on the bread, but not all over it only towards the middle, so I was able to eat the ends.   So delicious and such great value.  I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"I found this on Yelp, and love the food here so much that even though it's off the beaten track for me, I often try to bail off the 401 while on roadtrips just to go eat here.  I'm vegetarian, and their veggie wrap, for the money, is one of the best.  There is also a pretty fabulous potato bread (bolani), which, although you have to call ahead if you want it to arrive while you are eating the rest of your food, is wonderful.  They also do a good job of managing rushes by pre-prepping trays etc., but because a lot   of the food is prepped when you order it, expect a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"My favourite place to dig-in for rice and chunks,forgetting everything about calories. Well, as new location is pretty wide and very good for big groups compared to one in Mathieson . Some concerns with very dark walls ! They still have to work more on floor cleaning after messy weather. Many tables you can spot rice here and there ! Take away could more enjoyable option."}
{"text":"Best chunk, manto and kaboli rice in Mississauga. But I hate the atmosphere super jungle in waiting."}
{"text":"Busy place on a Saturday night.  We ordered the Lamb chops and the kofta and tandoori chicken combo...  Seating can be a challenge especially for large groups.  It's very busy with one group that literally occupied an entire row of 20 seats.  Order up front and grab a seat or vice versa depending if you want to gamble.  Food came out reasonably quickly.  The ticket numbers are broadcast on a tv screen so you know when to go up and get your own order.  All the food was tasty although the kofta and tandoori chicken were better than the lamb.  It feels a bit rushed as the experience is akin to finding parking at Costco where you have people scoping out your seats while you're still eating and waiting close by for you to finish so they can swoop in."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was good except for speed. I get kebobs often at various places so I have a sense of how long it should take to grill a kebob. This place took maybe 5 mins longer than I expected. Not a big deal to me. I wasn't in a hurry. The food made up for it.   I had the Waziri dinner. That's ground beef + chicken breast skewers served with rice, salad and afghan bread. It was delicious. I really like the bread. It was soft and highly edible even without condiments.   I eat middle eastern food often and the seasoning used here is definitely not shabby. Afghan food is a little different from Persian food and is a little different from Lebonese food. I like all 3."}
{"text":"One word \"Awesome\"  Yelp reviews help me find this hidden treasure. I usually eat at Bamiyan Kabob but to be honest they really lost my business now. Watan Kabob served us with juicy meat which has flavor, quantity is great, fresh bread and salad and above all amazing white and red sauce. We had one Sultani dinner and one Chicken dinner. If you reading this review plz keep in mind good things takes time to prepare so expect 15-20 min wait. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Watan Kabob is amazing in taste and speed. Had a Tandoori Chicken dish and I loved the taste. The Vege salad portion was quite small yet the positive is that it had more vegetables than leaves. Went with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed the food.  Staff are very friendly and is happy to make suggestions.  The only reason I gave a 4 star is because of the restaurant outlook. Pretty ordinary. However, there is a lot of natural light coming in."}
{"text":"Ive been on the hunt for good afghan food in the GTA for a while now. Im so happy i ran into this place unexpectedly, driving down dundas hungry with the fam one day, after running some errands. Portions are great. Food is tasty and fresh. Cant say anything bad. If youre craving this will deff hit the spot. 5/5 recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the best place serving Afghan cuisine and one of my regulars.  The place is usually crowded even on the weekdays.  I ordered Sultani Kebab dinner .Kebabs are succulent, juicy and well cooked and rice garnished with pomegranate seasoning . Naan is baked and fresh.  Cost for 2 : Under $25 Options to try : Tandoori kebab, Chapli kebab, lamb shank and waziri"}
{"text":"Very efficient restaurant even during the lunch rush! This was my first time here and upon entrance I was served very promptly by the server that suggested the chicken dinner. Came within 5 minutes and the food was fresh very flavourful and very generously portioned. The chicken was seasoned well and tasted great! The rice was seasoned well too! The dinner came with a naan bread and a salad too! Great food :) will def. go back again!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch, ordered the chicken beast kabob with salad and naan. Only $9! Great deal for that much food.   I'd give it 5 stars but the wait was really long for food. Next time order about 20-25 min ahead."}
{"text":"I like this place! It's busy at lunch, and you'll have to grab a seat and wait for your number to be called, but it's worth the wait.  I ordered takeout and had to wait awhile for my order. And by awhile, I mean like 20 mins. I think they forgot about my order in the back because they were so slammed with eat-in customers. I didn't mind though, I had the time.  If I was pressed for time I would have been pissed though. It was an unusually long amount of time for what I ordered.  I ordered the tandoori chicken wrap and the Afghan salad. The wrap was $5.99 and a great size. I didn't need the salad. Speaking of the salad, it wasn't worth it to me. It was iceberg lettuce, some olives, a nice dressing and some cabbage, I think. Although it was a large portion, the wrap was filled with salad so I really didn't need to order it.  Overall I will return and try other items on the list. All the meat dishes looked great coming out of the kitchen and it was all fresh and grilled perfectly."}
{"text":"Been to many afghani restaurants in the area; however, this one is the best. Love the food taste. The only down side is that they put everything like the chicken or kebab, rice, and salad in one plate which makes no room for you to eat."}
{"text":"3 stars for food 1 star for service 3 stars for cleanliness  i have experienced much better. they gave me half of the food 10 minutes after when i am almost done with my dinner (they forgot to give me the skewer)."}
{"text":"Watan Kabob is an Afghani restaurant located in Mississauga, Ontario that serves 100% Halal Afghani dishes ranging from kabobs to tandoori chicken to fresh fish. Their recently opened second location is located at the corner of Winston Churchill Blvd and Dundas St W which straddles the border of Mississauga and Oakville.  I have been to their original Matheson Blvd location quite a few times but was happy to hear they opened a new location hoping that the second location wouldn't be as busy and hectic.  I went on a recent Friday night and decided to go with my normal order of a Wazeri Kabob dinner ($13.99 plus tax) which consists of 1 skewer of a chicken breast kabob, 1 skewer of a kofta kabob, basmati rice, a salad and fresh naan bread. The chicken breast kabob and kofta kabob were perfectly cooked and seasoned, tender and juicy. The basmati rice was nice and fluffy, the salad was fresh and the naan bread was right out of the oven.  The new location has a more upscale decor and can accommodate larger groups. At the same time because the new location can accommodate large groups, it's as busy if not busier than their original location around dinner time.  Overall, Watan Kabob is a really good choice if you are looking for delicious authentic Afghani food that is reasonably priced and really well executed."}
{"text":"Tried this based on Stephanie S. recommendation.  I had the Tandoori Chicken Kabob dinner. It was 11.49 before taxes.  While I loved the rice, I found the chicken to be too much like Indian tandoori chicken and didn't really differentiate itself.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was pretty flavourful, but I expected something different than Indian tandoori chicken.    Also, the salad was limited as it was just a few leaves of lettuce and some diced tomatoes on top.  I was expecting a bigger salad, with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.  The naan was not bad.    So while I think this place will do in a crunch for Afghan food and that the rice is delicious, I think Pamier Kabob (about 10-15 minutes north in Brampton) is better as they  a) Have a tandoori chicken special, which also includes a beef skewer b) Bigger salad c) but rice isn't as good as Watan.    So if rice is your thing and you live in the area, try it out and you won't regret it.  But if meat is your thing, Pamier is better."}
{"text":"Yummmy! Delicious kabobs!!! The best that I've eaten in the GTA! I love afghani food and this one is the best around! The Chapli Kababs are a big hit and the tandoori chicken boneless is amazing as well. They have combos so you get to try both things! Yummmy food, always busy location but will definitely be back again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"We've begun to love Afghan food and been to the well known Bamiyan Kabob on Dixie. Watan Kabob is BETTER imho because it is cleaner, less crowded and the food is just as good!!  Our usual get is the lamp kabob dinner plate and add an extra beef kabob, it comes with bread and an AMAZING spicy tomato sauce. And it's an awesome value, my wife and I can get easily full for less than $20. We recently discovered this restaurant which was 5 minutes from our home, and boy are we glad we did!"}
{"text":"This place has good food. The ambiance is ok and more like a dining place. So you get good food, and in good potions, but not a sit-chat place. I am a constant visitor"}
{"text":"Updated review, you could also read my previous one.  I have reviewed this place long ago..and have been here way too many times after that.  I'm still in love with their quality,quantity and taste.This restaurant is definitely amongst  my most favorite places to eat in the GTA.  My previous review had bathroom concerns but I'm glad to tell everyone reading they have renovated their bathrooms.  Wait time here is still 20 -25 mins after placing the order and their argument is that we make/ grill everything fresh.And they do win this argument with flying colors."}
{"text":"Didn't know about this place was so close to my neighborhood but I'm glad I had the chance to check it out.  I ordered the Tandoori Kabob dinner and the portion was huge! (thats what she said) The rice/salad was really fresh and the chicken was absolutely delicious. The soft and warm naan bread helped top everything off.  Give the place a shot if you're looking for good Afghan food. It's well worth the money."}
{"text":"This location is new. And wow it will be around a while. The location at dundas and Winston Churchill has been a plague area for restaurants. Countless restaurants have fallen to the traffic of the area. But Watan Kabab was so busy, not only was there zero parking. But the order I called in was ready for pick up after just over an hour. We ordered the mantoo to starts. Large dumplings in a wonderful sauce. The lentils were cooked perfectly. The chicken and beef kababs were perfectly spiced and cooked. It wasn't spicy. But the spices were lovely. The tandoori chicken was also lovely flavoured. And a bit spicy on the tongue. The rice was perfect. It's even better with raisins and carrots on top (if you like that kind of thing). The chaplee is huge. Come hungry. And the firnee was sweet and soft. A nice compliment to the meal. I'll come back for sure. For the cost the servings are huge."}
{"text":"Hands down the best afghani place in the GTA! Everything is so flavourful and cooked to perfection. My go to is the tandoori chicken dinner, its marinated to perfection and the rice is so soft and fluffy. The best part is the bread they give you, fresh and so tasty. My only complaint would be that you don't give you more than one"}
{"text":"I went to this place during Ramadan and this place was packed. They offer middle Eastern chicken and beef preparations with rice anD naan.  I ordered chicken tikka over rice and absolutely loved it. Chicken was evenly cooked and juicy..  I would definetly recommend this place to a friend"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Watan. It was around 120pm and the lunch rush had died down. We ordered the following:  Chicken Kofta Salad and bread, Sea Bass Dinner plus one extra piece of chicken kofta and one extra piece of Chapli Kebab.  You may wonder why the extra meat. N&K gave me issues. BTW the dinner with the extras was mine.  The food was ready in approx10 mins. The Chicken Koftas were huge and very delicious. Two big pieces with salad and bread. The Sea Bass Dinner plus extras came with a full bass (lol) chicken kofta, Chapli ,rice, salad and bread. I got through all the rice and salad, half the bread and half the bass, half the Chapli and all the chicken. I was pleasantly stuffed at this point. Let me speak about Watans Chapli. To sum it up using as few words as possible, delicious.  They ground up the good meat and spiced it up nicely. The Chicken  Kofta was also very delicious.  Spiced nicely and cooked to perfection retaining its moisture. Finally the sea bass. I wrote that it was a full sea bass and truly it is.  I got two full sized filets. I even had to ask the waitress if this was a regular portion and she confirmed it. So much for me thinking I was special. The fish was spiced just right and cooked my standards.  Light moist and flakey.  YUM. I like most of the helper before me, I strongly recommend this restaurant. Take care my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"The food at Watan Kabob is hot, fresh, tasty and the portion size is very good.  Prices are very reasonable  Restaurant layout is open, spacious, clean and seating is very comfortable.  Online orders are possible.  Order status is presented on large screens, so you know when to move from your comfy seat to the counter to get your order.  Enjoyed my visit , will recommend to my friends and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent at this place with my family (came here maybe 15 times in the last month and half) as no one's cooking at home at the moment but tonight's trip I had here will be my last time. New kids they hired are just RUDE and IGNORANT! plus all 5 of us that was dining tonight found our meals to be under cooked with rice from atleast a day old. Poor experience. I'm gonna go back to Bamiyan."}
{"text":"Ever so consistent with their food.  We always order Wazieri kebab (chicken and kofta with rice, salad and afghan bread) and you can't beat the price for the quality and quantity you're getting.  You could feed 2 people with 1 order.  Just be wary when ordering ahead, make sure you call to confirm as at times they forget to start the order and so you end up waiting considerably when you get there.  they get pretty busy."}
{"text":"If you want good Afghan food in a huge portion, this is the place for you. I have been here twice, and both time we were happy so as our stomachs. The only pro I have for this place is that it gets is so busy. They do their best to keep the service fast, for example, they have a screen that shows you order numbers when they are ready to be picked up. Dining here might not be the best idea if you go  during pick times because there are just too many people and hard to get water, napkins, plates, and everything since they run out so quickly. Other then that, this place is good! Definetly worth trying :)  Bottom line: good food, good service, reasonable price, and generous portion. I would recommend take-out if you are visiting during pick times"}
{"text":"The chicken had not been cooked properly and they didnt do anything to fix it just simply told the chef and gave me that plate"}
{"text":"Explored this location a year back but could  not visit. Sunday lunch today was the right day . Premium Afghani grill casual dining place . Location service n food all were above expectations ! Ordered Chapli kebab Diner platter came with 2 juicy beef kebabs along with salad n basmati rice and Afghani Naan . Also tried chicken breast Stew , a Korma like gravy with distinctive flavours served with Tandoori Naan . Highly recommended place for food lovers Okay !"}
{"text":"Hi fellow foodies out there , I am giving this place a horrible rating mainly because I have never seen such disorganized Kaos in a restaurant in my life along with the worst customer service I have experienced in a long time ... Let's start with the food I ordered the  chicken and  meat kabobs with salad and there nan type bread this place you have to pay at counter then your food comes out ....let's just say that it was me and only another couple and I waited about 20 minutes for my food to come out...I don't know how they can be so slow at lunch hour when I counted about 16 people working in back kitchen ..the portion that came out was large for sure and well worth the $13.00 for the amount of food you get, but both the chicken and meat were extremely over cooked and dry the salad was dry with hardly any dressing on it could not even taste the dressing on salad , I would never go back to this place again for the poorest customer service and food quality was way below poor"}
{"text":"Best place to eat. Love the food n they have huge portions. Will go again n again. Its not like they cook n keep it , It's fresh food n they cook right away when you order."}
{"text":"The servers I met are very friendly. They also keep the place neat.   The quality of the food is good. Even though the waiting time is a bit long in my point of view, it worths the time! The selection of food is a wide range from chicken, beef to fish. With the combination of the salads, it meets the average intake for everyone.  I choose this place a regular one to visit per week. Hopefully they will keep the standard of what they are offering."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for consistent,quality, healthy and delicious kabobs. Call ahead for bigger orders. A lunchtime fave for our office staff! Clean place and just renovated to make the seating area larger! Staff always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food -5 stars!  Service- 3 stars (mixed up our orders and we had to wait for 20 minutes)  The food was actually very good, the meat was nice and juicy and I liked the sauce that they served with it.  That's a shame that they're so disorganized and I saw that they many people were complaining because their orders got mixed up."}
{"text":"If you're coming here on a Saturday you can expect to wait at least 30 mins for your meal. All we ordered was 2 wraps.  No matter how good the food presumes to be no one should have to wait that long."}
{"text":"We ordered fish dinner, chicken breast kabob and kofta kabob - fish was baked a little watery and didn't seem marinated enough - but was pretty tasty. Rest were pretty good. Good value, large portions and good service. Be prepared to wait 15+ minutes as they grill per order"}
{"text":"Best tandoori chicken in townnnnn. Gotta try the fish tandoori too. The beef is just okay. Food takes awhile but quantity and quality make up for it. You probably have to wait at least 20 min"}
{"text":"Great food and value! It's an Afghan grill house that specializes in skewered meats. It's a casual place where you order and pay first, choose wherever you want to sit, then wait for your order number to be featured on a video screen for pick-up (similar to McDonald's).   On an early Sunday evening (7pm), it was not too busy, but we still had about 10 order numbers ahead of us until we received our order. The staff are friendly and efficient.   The kabobs options include chicken, beef, lamb, and fish with salad, and an option of naan or rice. The Wazeri comes with chicken and kofta (ground beef and lamb with spices). We also ordered a side of lamb shank side ($7.99), and doogh, a light yogurt-cucumber drink with herbs. It was generally quite salty, but it went well with the naan bread and the salad. The chicken was flavourful and juicy, and was the highlight of the three meats we tried. The doogh was also a refreshing drink to have along with the meat!   The washrooms need a bit of work, but the restaurant is good for groups and families."}
{"text":"I just ate the famous chicken tandoori, the best part of my experience wasnt the chicken, it was the customer service by Amna and Sara, they were so nice and made sure the food was upto standards, and if I wanted any extra sauces"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here. This is totally my kind of place. It's all about the food. You place your order as you step in and wait for your number to show up on the screen.   Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. I couldn't believe the freshly baked bread that goes out with every order. I highly recommend the chaplee kebob and the tandoori fish. I'll have more recommendations once I visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I have tried several other afghan places in north america but this one is by far my favorite. Highly recommend the chapli kabobs and chicken tikka. The chapli kabobs were the best I ever had. Be aware that this is definitely more of a hole in the wall but if you can get past the ambience, this place is well worth it."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place, The food is soo good that is addictive, big portion sizes, very clean dinning room. Staff are always smiling and very friendly. The wait sometimes is long but it is worth it. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I consider my self a regular.  Been coming here for the past year,  before the renovation and after the renovation.   Food hasn't change,  always been on point Place is clean.   Staff is friendly.  Prices are fairly cheap.   Good location.   Service is good.   Always coming back.  :)"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious kebabs and afghani style food. I always get the barg kebab and it was so juicy and tender. Rice is always so tasty. The naan bread is to die for. So fluffy in the middle and crispy out on the outside.  The only knock is the high price for a water bottle! Cmon its the same size as a pop bottle but charging almost $2 for a water bottle for a serve yourself resto is a bit much. Despite that, I will return and just bring my own water."}
{"text":"The place has been renovated about a year ago, and also has expanded, now having more dine in capacity. It stays open till 11:00pm, a good choice for late hour diners.  The food quality is good, better than average. Service is just about average, with moderately fast turn around time in delivering orders.   We tasted almost all the items in the menu in last 2 years!! The Barg Kabob is recommended.... filet mignon are well marinated, tender and cooked to perfection. The Fish Tandoori is delicious. Nicely prepared and appetizing."}
{"text":"Quick service (self-service) and reasonable prices combined with delicious plates make this a good option for a Friday lunch for me. Also, I love their naans. Fries were a little too salty."}
{"text":"A good find cuz of the yelpers! I'd never have noticed otherwise. Alright, going in nice place, simple. Nothing fancy. The food was mostly delicious. The kabob and the fish especially were fantastic, the chicken Wasn't as moist (too dry for my palate). The naan was great while hot, the moment it got a bit cool became quite hard. Food took about 15-20 min to come out.   All of this an I would've given 4 stars no issues. The next star that they loose it on is the very very very dry front desk / customer service. Quite poor frankly, all of them seemed to be carrying major chips with attitude.. For what I've no clue. I still might head back for the food... But cuz of the customer service its a slim might. Not bad for a try though."}
{"text":"I came across this place while en route to another Afghani Restaurant in the area, it's in the back of the Mandarin plaza so it's somewhat hidden from the road. I walked into their newly renovated seating area and ordered what I normally have at Afghani places (Chaplee Kebab). The taste, quality, and quantity is definitely better than other Afghani restaurants in the area. Since the place isn't as busy as other restaurants; the service is much better. Although sometimes getting your food may take awhile to get it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing-- the food is cheap, fresh, flavourful, and authentic! The staff are very nice, though it can get very busy at times. It takes a while to get to the cashier sometimes because of the line, but food is prepared quickly so it's never a long wait.  I love the Afghani rice with carrots and raisins, and the chicken pieces. They also do an amazing barg kabab that I tried tonight, so that's great too. They give you free bread with your order, and the bread is soft and fresh (but I have no idea if it's made in-house or not), which is nice after seeing places like Jamie's Italian who refuse to do that. The chilli sauce and yogurt sauce are both very nice, and I love the bolanee dipped in the yogurt. Their lamb shank is also quite good, but the chicken pieces and rice are what I keep coming back for."}
{"text":"Hello everyone !! Watan kabob this is the best BBQ Which is JUICY, fresh, flavourful, quatity, appeance, customer service, ambiance of the restaurant is amazing. I have not tried their tandoori fish but beef and chicken is mouthwatering. For example, WAZERI KABOB DINNER, chicken breast dinner, tandoori fish preffered. However, they have more options for beverages too like doogh- yoghurt drink and afghani green tea. Good place for kids too.   Secondly, it is locted on hurontario and matheson blvd in a big plaza i would rather say its a food plaza. Coz it has mandarin, pomodoro italian restaurant and burger king.   They serve halal food."}
{"text":"Food continues to be superb. Portions are just perfect. Customer service in general has also been very good. Now deserves a five star rating! If you like Bamiyan, drop it and go to Watan Kabab!"}
{"text":"Great food but this place has the slowest service. It changes nothing if they are not busy. If you have patience it is worth the wait but DO NOT come here if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always went to Bamiyan but tried this place for the first time and I got an extra order of meat for the same price as Bamiyan's with one meat kabob only! And the hot sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"When a place is full of families at 11pm on a Monday night the food has to be good. Well it was pretty good. We split a dinner plate with beef and chicken kebab. It was plenty for the two of us. The meat was tender and tasty. There was plenty of sides: rice, naan and salad!   I realized we maybe ordered the wrong thing when nearly every table had some sort of hamburger shaped kebab. I have no idea what it is but I'll be back for it."}
{"text":"Great recommendations Yelpers. I was looking for a healthy, easy, nearby dinner after a day of traveling. I was not disappointed. The dinner plate was huge and tasty.  Chicken kebab was cooked perfectly and the naan was fresh and flavorful.  I'm working out how to get back again before I head home.  Not a fancy place, but a bustling, straightforward local place that suited this traveler well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today at Watan Kabob. The food is good, the platter comes with choice  of meats that is chicken, lamb or beef, rice, salad, fresh Pita and spicy tomato chutney (sauce).   The restaurant is clean, the front desk girls need to be more polite. The most irritating thing about the place is their chairs , have never experienced so much noise in a restaurant when any customer gets up or pulls a chair it scrapes against the tiled floor and makes a very loud annoying noise. Literally, we would could not talk among ourselves. We just ate and left."}
{"text":"Where do I start! Love the food! It's amazing every time we go! Very nice place to bring your family. Lots of seating area."}
{"text":"Very random observation here, but I think Watan Kabob needs to establish some other system for their canned/bottled drinks - aside from the 'honour system'.  The last time I was here, I witnessed a bunch of younger kids, who were already seated and eating, get up from their chairs, go to the fridge, grab drinks, and go back to their food.  One can only *assume* that they did not pay for their drinks.  And even as a customer, I felt bad for the business.  Am I just a cynical person?"}
{"text":"Great food.  From what I was told, the owner of this place use to work for Bamiyan Kebob and decided to branch off on his own.  The food is exactly the same, but the wait is much less which is why I often frequent this location.  The reason I didn't give them a 5 is because they aren't that friendly and a bit cheap when you ask for extra sauce - which they don't often provide.    Other than that, quite good."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and everything was very yummy! Awesome portion size and all the meat & chicken tasted amazing! As it was a Saturday night, the place was packed! Even though we went to pick up our food a bit late, we still had to wait for everything to be ready. Only complaint is that we also ordered the firnee but did not receive it in our takeout bag. Otherwise great food, great portion size and good prices."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer to this restaurant since it opened up. Very clean interior & good for dining in with family & friends. Everything on the menu is delicious, their quantity is quite good. My favorites are the Waziri & Chapli plates. We even ordered take away for approximately 15 guests this past Ramadan for an Iftaar dinner, & there were no complaints at all.   And their open late till 11pm, so just order ahead to reduce wait times."}
{"text":"YES... This place is delicious...  My wife and i, after a long day of Christmas shopping decided to try this place on the way home.  The place was busy, and the aroma of the fiery grill filled the air.  I ordered a Tandoori Wrap, hot.  It cost with tax $6.77, when it arrived, it was massive, and it tasted absolutely AMAZING!!!!  will go again, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Amazing food..full of flavors. The wazeree very tender and rice is good.need to wait long time but the food always fresh"}
{"text":"I went to Watan Kabob today and I can happily say I left full and happy. I ordered a chicken breast kabob. The portion is huge... I will warn anyone coming here about the size. The platter was enormous and one entire side was filled with salad and the other was filled with rice. The also included a large afghan bread as well in addition to all this!  The chicken itself was freshly made as I placed my order. None of this reheating stuff that other places are doing. Since they make things to order, it can take a longer time. I got mine in under than 10 minutes but my friend who ordered nearly 5 minutes after me had her come in almost 15 minutes after she ordered since it was a near zoo by the time noon arrived. This place gets packed quickly and I can see why.  The meat was really nicely seasoned, great spices, free of fatty bits or ligaments, and like the salad and rice, the portion was quite large. I would say it's like the size of 2 medium sized chicken breasts for the order. There was nice charred bits on the chicken. The chicken wasn't over done and still fairly moist. They could have taken the chicken off the grill probably a minute earlier and it would have been better but considering they had like 20 orders on the go during the lunch time frame, it was pretty darn good.  The place is clean, service is polite, food plentiful, and the price... affordable! The entire platter was only $10 and some change. I'm returning to try the other dishes like tandoori and the fish dinner."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and always fresh but the sitting arrangement is horrible. Please get some waiters and seating staff. Also bus boys would help"}
{"text":"Amazing Afghani food. Their selection is great and the dishes are delicious. Been here twice now and its been a great experience each time. You order at the front, seat yourself, and watch for your order number to come up on the screen. Once you grab your meal, sit down, dig in, and just enjoy the bliss that is their dishes. The meats are cooked with perfection and the spices bathe your taste buds in heavenly bliss. Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"YUMMY + HALAL!  One of the tastiest tandoori chicken I've had. Can't beat the portion for the price. I've never had afghani naan but it was really good and would recommend everyone to try it.   Plenty of parking spaces and lots of seating. Perfect for a family or a large group outing. This is a popular place and there were a lot of people, so expect a wait after you order... but it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"First time having afghan food and it was awesome!! I had a kabob plate! I will come back next time in town!"}
{"text":"New location lots to improve upon. Food is identical to Bamiyan Kebab.  More selection if you like Fish.  Overall food quality is a B+  Management is poor.  Place is run by young people and lacks floor awareness.   Tables left behind with leftover plates etc. are not cleared in a timely manner.    Bathroom needs serious work.  Staff members hanging out and chit chatting while toilets are left in poor conditions.  See pics."}
{"text":"I had the tandoori chicken breast meal twice here and both times it felt like some of the pieces were not cooked properly. The employees taking your order seem like they hate their job or lack proper social skills and it took them 20 minutes to prepare my food and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"This place bears the same decor as the restaurant that came before it, with Asian-inspired design and surprisingly, this look works! The space is modern and spacious with the ordering area in the front of the restaurant with additional seating in the back. You order food at the bar and wait for your number to be called on the screen in the seating area, like a hybrid sit-down/take-out restaurant which keeps things moving quickly and efficiently.  The food was just as good! We ordered 2 dishes (the tandoori wazeri dinner and a lamb shank with a side of naan) as well as a yogurty drink called doogh. All the meats were moist and incredibly flavorful and the naan was still warm. We'd never had a drink like doogh before although the flavors went really well with the meats + side dishes!  Overall, a great experience for Afghan cuisine and I would definitely be back to try some of the other offerings on their menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Amazing kabobs.gets busy but they are very good. Fresh bread is on point!"}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Watan Kabob ever since it opened, but after that their service has gone down hill. They have gotten my order wrong numerous times and its annoying always having to complain about it every time. Now they increased their prices, regardless we still came. But today when we gave our order and went to pick it up we were given our food in half size containers than the usual ones. And when we asked the cashier she said these are the new containers we got. If you haven't gotten the regular containers you should have then just give our food in more boxes. We ask for salad packed separately and our three dinner salads was spaciously laid on one small box, it looked equivalent to 2 salad dinners . Rice was barely enough for the three dinners we ordered and the naans were stale. And to top it off again their cashier got my order wrong, she had the audacity to say I was wrong and I should check my order again, when she didn't even read the receipt right and just followed up with a sorry and ignored me. As a customer, I can not tolerate this nonsense and am extremely disappointed with their service.  I used to be a loyal customer but never coming back here again. There are alot more better places that offer decent service."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food here, but I've been here 2x in the past month, and both times I've had to leave because the service is so bad.  The lunch line-ups to order is nothing short of chaotic, and when I finally did get a chance to order, it took over 20 minutes for them to realize that they missed my order.  I cancelled my order and got my money back 2x.  Terrible customer service.  Bahhh!    (Mr. Sub, here I come)"}
{"text":"The ordering process is pure chaos.   Food's good, place is clean, people are polite. If they could just fix the ordering process. I'd rate it higher."}
{"text":"Amazzzzing! The best afghani Cuisine I've ever had. Great Chapli kAbob, great tikkah, good qorma. What a lovely meal. Hats off to them"}
