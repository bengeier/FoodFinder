{"text":"I just graduated from CMU and the thing that I miss most about Pittsburgh is Pho Minh.  Their pho is unbelievable and their #4 (pork spring roll) is equally as amazing.  Moreover, Pho Minh completely trumps Tram's Kitchen.  I took my parents here for my \"last meal\" before leaving the City and they loved it, too.  They aren't into 'ethnic food' at all.  That being said, I would take ANYONE here.  Their grilled chicken (#30 something) is perfect for people who dislike pho.    It's a must if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot for Vietnamese food. It's not the best in Pittsburgh, but it offers a good portion of pho with great flavor. The vegetables taste fresh, too. I especially like the fried shrimp spring roll. The wrapping is crisp and light, and the filling is delicious. I'm not a fan of the fried pork spring roll though; the meat was dry and lacked any strong flavor. The restaurant itself is small and intimate; I like eating in because it's pretty quiet and the service is attentive and nice. I've also ordered pick-up a few times without any issues. Overall, I definitely recommend giving this place a try. FYI, it's cash only."}
{"text":"Tremendous Vietnamese food at a bargain! The grumpy service and kitschy music adds to the charm. In all seriousness, don't miss this rough diamond!"}
{"text":"Best place for pho in the city. I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more. The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt, but she is very friendly once you get to know her. I love the little old man who seats you when you come in the door, and serves you tea. You have to ask for water if you want it. I love the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer. The sauce is so good I wish I could put it on everything. I usually get pho with chicken or the special Spicy soup. The ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy. The food is very flavorful and perfect after a weekend of riding my snowboard. If you are looking for authentic pho then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We traversed the Pittsburgh snowglobe post yoga for Pho. Generally Tram's has been the pho destination. I was curious to try another spot.  Restaurant is cash only. Smaller and less \"warm\" than Trams, but with the same familiar atmosphere. The menu is more extensive than Trams, and seems to have a greater variety of rice and vermicelli dishes.   The spring rolls were okay - gummy thick wrapper - the tofu was a bit too soft.   Green papaya salad with shrimp and nuts - refreshing however I personally resent when restaurants use frozen \"supermarket\" grade shrimp and charge premium. With several fish resources in the Strip I really expect better quality shrimp.  Pho was much lighter than what I have become accustomed to - and in contrast to another reviewer - I thought it was much less saltier than what I have had at Trams. The beef at Pho Minh was a better quality or cooked longer because I didnt experience the tendony gristle I sometimes find in the pho at the other place, It was soft and well flavored =).   I would come back here for Pho again or to try something else off the menu. I think they can improve on the quality of some of the ingredients, but I appreciate the much less filling, and less bloating Pho.."}
{"text":"Yea yea yea Tram's is great tra la la but the pho here is better! The broth, noodles, and beef are all tastier. And their other noodle dishes have always been delicious. My first choice for Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh   And everyone knows the main reason you go to Tram's is to see the  one-armed dude."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place is sub-par. The broth was fragrant, but a little bland to my liking. I've been in Pittsburgh since October and I've tried most of the pho in this city and I'm my honest opinion Vietnam's Pho is the best. This place is comparable to Tram's, but being that I live in Houston which has plenty of amazing Vietnamese food to choose from and I end up always going back to Vietnam's Pho when I'm in Pittsburgh.   If I rank the places I've been to in Pittsburgh , it would be as follows starting from the best: Vietnam's Pho, Pho Van, Tan Lac Vien, Pho Minh, then Tram's Kitchen.   I know this isn't consistent with the Yelp reviews, but you can't go by the number of stars a place has all the time. If you're a transplant like me and always looking/wanting good Pho but want to avoid the trial and error like I did there's my 2 cents."}
{"text":"In sum, I very much enjoy this place. Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post.   For an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \"as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\" YUMMY!  I thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing.   The staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.  There are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person."}
{"text":"A total dive, but worth it. Service is good and the Pho is authentic."}
{"text":"I've moved to Chicago, where there is excellent Vietnamese food, but I still dream of Number 40 with tofu."}
{"text":"Just to reiterate:  Cash only, you've been warned.  Now on to the important stuff:  Good, no-nonsense, warming pho (and bun also on the menu.)  Many different meat combos to choose from, though I am partial to flank steak and brisket.  Pho is in the name of the restaurant, and it's the main star of the show here.   Lemongrass tofu is wonderful as an appetizer and upon sitting down you are presented with a nice warm pot of tea.  The ambiance is no-nonsense and the Vietnamese ballads playing on the background transported me to far off lands."}
{"text":"I am baffled by some of the low reviews this place got. It looks kind of like a hole in the wall--OK, it is a hole in the wall--but it's got tasty, tasty pho. And, as Al L. mentioned, they give you tea when you come in, a nice touch.  I once ordered some kind of curry. It was not bad, but not spectacular. I'm sticking with pho from now on, as it is really fantastic.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am about to make a bold statement; Pho Minh is better than Tram's (and I love Tram's).  I had the chicken pho, and it was absolutely amazing. The summer rolls were fantastic as well, and the owners of Pho Minh are delightful people. I will be going back for pho very, very soon."}
{"text":"The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!"}
{"text":"One of my favoirte restaurants. Always very good. I recommend the tofu in lemon grass or green onion sauces for an appetizer. Keep in mind the place is a bit small so it may fill up quickly on a busy night."}
{"text":"The pho is excellent! Good portion, price. The rare beef was rare, unlike most places. The soup was very flavorful and delicately spiced, and you get all the types of condiments you could possibly want. Combine that with the good service - especially that friendly old man. The free tea served in ceramic adds to the feeling of authenticity.  The haters on these reviews probably aren't from around here. You can't compare this to little saigon or something - not the right locale or resources. But it's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"The pho here is decent, but the portions are small. The broth is good. I'd come here before Trams. But after reading all the reviews on Vietnamese restaurants in Pittsburgh, I have to say that the majority of people in Pittsburgh have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to Vietnamese food particularly pho. I would say that Pho Minh so far has the second best pho I've tasted in the city after Pho Van. Unfortunately this city is not a pho city."}
{"text":"At a conference in town and had a little too much fun last night, hence my desperation for a bowl of pho. Theirs isn't the best I've ever had; The broth was a bit cloudy and kind of tasted like there was some chicken in it rather than beef. However, it was still good and got the job done. Plus, they were very nice people and give you a small pot of tea which I thought was a nice touch. All in all, a solid four out of five stars"}
{"text":"Maybe I went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible. The spring rolls were falling apart and only filled with noodles and a couple of sad looking shrimp, no thai basil or mint leaves or cilantro to speak of. I also got some crispy noodles with seafood which I only ate because I had been sitting on a train for 9 hours and was starving. And the whole thing was seriously overpriced for Pittsburgh, New York prices for extremely subpar vietnamese, meh."}
{"text":"The Beef Salad is exactly what you think it is.  No one can say that it anything but a beef salad. That fact is undeniable.   Love the deep fried pork rolls."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and I had vegetarian options. I thought the tofu was flavored well. I really liked my time here and I will be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad. That said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory.  I both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce. Delicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA."}
{"text":"I was surprised they take cash only ,it's 2017 already don't they have to pay tax ?the lady was so mean service don't know how to say hi thank you"}
{"text":"Great pho, my favorite so far in Pittsburgh. The service was good too! It's cash only but that's fine as long as you prepare."}
{"text":"This place is totally off the beaten path, but well worth it. Prices are awesome, and the food is tasty. Get the spring rolls.   I ordered the #25 chicken soup with glass noodles and was pleased with it . The service is not great, nor are the restroom facilities, and I had to ask the restaurant constantly for any type of service at our table, but the food was good and done right. The chicken was slightly dry, but I'd definitley give this place another chance.   BYOB!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. They have quite a variety of Pho. Friendly staff that cater to your needs. One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pho.  That's it. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive. Nothing bad. Just reliably good pho soup, day in and day out.  I've never tried anything else on the menu and I probably never will.  It's tasty, fast, expeditious, and inexpensive.  Exactly what pho should be.  I'll keep coming here until I move out or die."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Pho and this is the best in Pittsburgh. The papaya salad is also outstanding. The meat and rice dishes are tasty and the spring rolls are delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pho places in the burgh!   Service is always fast and friendly and I've never had a dish I didn't like.  A good amount of GF friendly options."}
{"text":"Cash only.! ATM across the street.  Compared to Phoenix (hometown), their pho was alright. Nothing to write home about. Prices were average. Service was good. The spring rolls were good, but again, I had much better. It's definitely not the greatest pho restaurant, but with only a few options in Pittsburgh, this wasn't too bad. The service was friendly. Hot tea was nice especially on a colder day. Food portion could be better.   Probably will come back when I'm in the city. I just don't like the cash only rule."}
{"text":"Best pho noodle place in pittsburgh !!"}
{"text":"Tram's Kitchen was closed, so my girlfriend and I went up the street to Pho Minh instead.   Here are my gripes: - Food was WAY too salty (ie. we were both bloated like hell the next day) - Restaurant was WAY too quiet (they need to turn on the radio or something!) - Service was slow (or they often forgot simple requests like water, etc.)  I will credit them for their spring rolls though... and the sweet little man who runs the cash register! (I think he's Minh's husband?)"}
{"text":"Why did I ignore this place for so long?  I keep hearing off comments about this place.  \"It's ok.\"  \"It's decent but other places are better\" \"It's not as good as what you're use to (I'm from California)\" etc etc.  So I was never interested in coming here.  Today, I was working nearby and decided to stop in for the first time.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I decided to give the pho dac biet and spring rolls a try.  I was happy to see a pot of jasmine tea waiting for me when I put down the menu.  Spring rolls were good and was satisfying.  The pho has a nice light broth.  I like light broth.  Didn't feel too overly heavy and I can I feel I can enjoy it perfectly without hoisin sauce.  Portions were great and huge. The beef was good, it had chicken in it which I thought was good, and I am happy to say they use the good meatballs.  Other pho places I go to don't use the correct meatballs.  I finished my entire bowl.    The place is small.  Restrooms are basically closets.  I get hit by the door every time I go into the restroom.  But hey, I found it to be clean.    The decor was nothing special and they had Vietnamese music playing in the background.   They have the recognizable chairs that you see in most Vietnamese restaurants.  Everything about this place reminded me of home back in San Diego.  I felt the food was good and satisfying.  The people there were nice, checked up on us, and they were conversating with other guests even with their broken English.  I thought that was cute.  Prices here are a tad cheaper than other places.  Cash Only probably has to do with that.   Overall, I found my experience here pleasant.  I liked the pho and I will definitely be back to give the other dishes a try."}
{"text":"I am convinced this place has the best Pho in Pittsburgh the spring rolls are really good too. The space sure isn't fancy but the owners are friendly and attentive. It is the best pittsburgh has to offer for Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"So I seem to have a strange handicap.  My first pho experience was at Lulu's Noodles in Oakland...  and it has set the bar.  Yeah, the noodles aren't quite right, and the broth is not quite right, either...  but...  the chicken is GREAT.  It's nice and tender.    Since then I had some pho in California and the broth is better...  the noodles are better...  but the chicken is weirdly dry and tough.  I don't know how chicken cooked in soup can be dry and tough, but it is.    In that respect...  the pho at Pho Minh seemed quite authentic.  Noodles were good, broth was good - but chicken dry and tough.  Why does Lulu's have the market cornered on tender chicken in their pho???    My son had the beef pho and the broth was SO much tastier than the chicken - the chicken was OK but it's the beef broth that is awesome.    My biggest problem was I thought the portions seemed kinda small, for what you paid.  I guess they are adequate, but not super-satiating, for a pho crazed adult.  My plan was to share mine with my two toddlers, we tend to be light eaters, and it was kind of tense.  I expect a bowl of pho to be giant, based on my CA experiences.  I guess if we go again, the girls are going to have to get their own bowl to split.    I guess it is a credit to this place that my two picky toddlers liked it so much!  Decent pho, portions kinda small, service REALLY slow.  (I think we were in there 1 1/2 hours!  For a family of 5, not a huge group)  Will probably go back, but we want to check out Tram's first."}
{"text":"Very small place but the food was good. I enjoyed the fresh shrimp spring rolls. The Pho hit the spot and I will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Here is another restaurant experience that will make me wanna go there often, for more than just delicious food.. I have stopped by only once and had spicy beef woth lemongrass pho, and boy it was some spicy heaven ! My friends around the table tried different pho as well as some vegetarian tofu stir fry, and I didnt hear a complaint..   But the real impressive story about this place is not just food.. a bunch of us went there one afternoon.. we got there a few minutes after 2pm, time they close for lunch.. we saw the timing amd started walking back towards our car and one lady came out and called us back.. they served us with absolutely no rush and an older lady that cooked/prepared our food was genuinely happy to see us walk away happy.. when I eat that kind of food, it not only makes my body happy but mind happier.. people that know that food is not really bound by time but happines to serve.. !"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Pho Minh again last night, after having had a wonderful time meeting some of the Pittsburgh Yelp gang and Rachel, our new local Yelp ambassador. I didn't say much about the food in my previous review, so thought I'd rectify that.   I'm a big fan of Vietnamese bun, which is a dish made with rice noodles and some kind of grilled meat, usually served in a big bowl with sprouts, cukes, scallions, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce and carrots. What I'm looking for when I order this is meat (I usually get chicken) that has been well marinated, as this lends alot of the flavor to this dish. Pho Minh marinates theirs in hoisin and maybe other things, and it's delicious. They add a little of this sauce to the noodles and garnish with the salad, then serve it with their wonderful fish sauce. This is a dish I crave. Their veggies are really fresh, the meat is succulent, and all of the flavors complement eachother so well. I like a deep fried spring roll with my bun, so I always order one, and they slice it and serve it right in the bowl. These are great here...really meaty little rolls. They use pork, and it's almost like a pork meatball filling. When you order these as an appetizer you get 2 of them and a side of their molasses/fish sauce combo. Doug had the Hu tieu xao, which is chicken, shrimp and veggies stir fried with rice noodles. This dish has some funky Vietnamese flavors, and has fish sauce as a base for the stir fry sauce, so you have to like that, but if you do, this dish rocks. Like all of their food, it was very well prepared and delicious. The woman who waits tables here always offers us their traditional mung bean pudding dessert, and we always say yes. This is a sweet and starchy treat served hot with a lacing of coconut milk. I love it. Tea comes to the table automatically and is free, and they offer some nice hot and iced beverages in addition. We didn't have the pho on this visit, but I will reiterate that it's great. I think this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  This is a family owned and operated restaurant, so you will see the same friendly faces when you become a regular. Early on we learned to say hello/good afternoon in Vietnamese ( xin chao, pronounced shin chow) and we always get a big smile from the older gentleman who owns the place. Cash only, closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pho Minh, and I have eaten here more than a dozen times.  I love how the Pho is served with fresh Thai Basil and lime on the side.  The Pho is delicious, and perhaps the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Pho restaurant close to West Penn Hospital, I've had a lot better soup base, but I would say this is sub par Pho comparing that from California. Nonetheless,  it fufills average standards. Also had their tofu spring roll,  which was just alright.   Nothing too special at this place, typical mom and pop  Vietnamese noodle place for all locals."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this restaurant because the other one on peen was so occupied, however it was much better than we thought. The restaurant was very nice for its amenities and the music, it recollected me some old days when I was kid. And the pho was the best pho I have in Pittsburgh, the spring rolls were very interesting, which is grilled beef covering a shrimp. Highly recommended and we will definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I, straight up, love Pho Minh. This is one of those places that I would go to every day if I could. I love Vietnamese food, and have tried it in a fair number of cities. This was by far better than the best Vietnamese in Boston (Xinh Xinh) and a close second to the best Vietnamese in Seattle (Pho Bac).   I found Pho Minh, sort of on accident, my first trip to Pittsburgh. The owners were very kind and attentive. The food was delicious, fresh, everything was clean. The pho broth was the best I've ever had, delicately spiced and flavorful. They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.  We kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake. I have no idea what everyone is talking about. The ambiance? What ambiance? It smelled like urine. Seriously.   Needless to say, Pho Minh for life."}
{"text":"I go to Pho Minh often, but not for their pho, which is okay but not what I would call good.  I usually get their rice or rice noodle dishes served with grilled pork/chicken/shrimp.  The food, in terms of authenticity and quality is okay, but I have to take into account the fact that we're in Pittsburgh and it's hard to find many quality Vietnamese ingredients here.  However, the food is decent and the service is good.  It's a family business, and the couple that owns the place are very nice and courteous.  When I get too lazy to make some Vietnamese food for myself I go make a quick run to Pho Minh."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is the third Vietnamese places in Pittsburgh that I've tried and so far (Tan Lac Vien and Tram's Kitchen), I think this is the best one. I pretty much always get the vermicelli at Vietnamese places- here, I usually get their roasted pork vermicelli and the pork is great- nice and tender with a bit of chew, pretty much no \"weird\" bits of gristle to bite into. I do wish there was a bit more of that wonderful Vietnamese brightness from lime/mint/rice vinegar/etc, at least in the vermacelli.  Be sure to get the lemongrass tofu- I usually get it to share with others as an appetizer, but could easily eat two plates of it myself.    It's certainly not the fanciest place in Pittsburgh, but it is charming.  The owners are very polite and attentive and don't rush you out the door the second you're done. It's a BYOB, so a great place to have a no-frills lazy dinner with friends. I get the sense a lot of the people there are regulars and seem to know the owners pretty well. I wish they were open a bit later, but I suppose this is Pittsburgh after all."}
{"text":"I'll start with the \"bad\" stuff - the place is a small hole-in-the-wall, in an area that, at some times of day, may make you double-check that you locked your car. The restaurant is not the cleanest, nor is the menu the most extensive. HOWEVER...having traveled to Vietnam, and having been to a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants around the US, this is certainly one of the most authentic. In fact, it reminds me of being in Vietnam. Are the spices on point? Yes! Delicious bowls of soup that should leave you with enough to bring home? Check! A couple cobwebs in the corner? Most definitely! An experience, to be sure. The place was about deserted on a Monday at lunch time, which was great for us - we got a window seat!  We started our meal with tea - this was your basic tea, nothing to write home about. We added on the spring roll with shrimp - and it was obviously freshly handmade to our order. Great appetizer to begin with - it's my barometer of a Vietnamese restaurant. This was a good one, not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty. I followed this up with a green papaya salad - heavy on the fish sauce (yum!) and covered in shrimp and peanuts. Very refreshing and light. My friend ordered the chicken curry with yam, which was creamy, freshly made (the veggies were not overcooked, as you find most places that premake lots of food) and not too spicy. I ordered the spicy vegetable soup with mushrooms. I'm not your average diner, and I like my spicy foods VERY spicy. This was maybe a 1-2/10. Pretty disappointing to me, but luckily the table was equipped with homemade Sriracha-like sauce and the ubiquitous chili-in-oil sauce found in cafes all over Vietnam. This solved the problem. The soup was fresh and filling. I will certainly be back again. There were tons of menu items I am dying to try!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Pittsburgh. Way better than Tram's kitchen. Must try the fried shrimp roll.  Warning: closed on Tuesdays. Seriously, WHAT THE PHO? Don't make the same mistake as me, so check their website first to find out which day they close since it might change. And cash only!"}
{"text":"Canme here based on the good review. The pho was bland. The service was typical Vietnamese, so we didn't have much expectation. I really can not imagine this place as the best pho in town, but to be honest, I could not find decent pho here in pittsburgh after trying at least 5 Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"So I am currently sitting here with Pho Minh's Pho tai...and I honestly have to say I am not impressed.  Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.  I decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...  The broth is actually good, very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy, smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth, and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them, and barely any shrimp.  All in all, I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday, but otherwise...nay"}
{"text":"I'm from socal. LA is pretty much my second home. I'm very familiar with all types of Asian food. This Viet place is actually not as bad as I thought it would be, considering it's in Pittsburgh.  I ordered #17 noodles in beef broth with rare steak and tripe $7.50.  It's not as loaded so the soup is a little more plain but it's good. I drank most of it and I don't feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. There's literally like no meat though. All together, the meat pieces if placed side by side on my hand MAYBE would have covered my palm ._. As for tripe, all the pieces laid in a line, were probably two finger lengths ._. It was sad how stingy they were. The bowl was barely 3/4 full and had a handful of noodles (I know because I took another order to go).  They give you the normal sides with the leaves, beans and one lime (forgot what it's called my bad). It's a decent portion I suppose.  They also give tea for free and it's pretty good.   Service: there's an older lady doesn't give good service. She just walks back and forth, not acknowledging anyone.  The entire hour that I was there, there were 3 other doubles and single customers.   Cleanliness: the table wasn't sticky. The condiments weren't either. Floor was clear. Chairs weren't too beat up. I didn't have a chance to check out the bathrooms.  Once I paid, she didn't give me the right amount back.. she gave me a dollar and some change less than owed. But I didn't say anything. So I just left a dollar less on the table as tip.   Basically: this place is very stingy with everything and nowhere near as good when compared to little Saigon IN LA and the usual place that I go to, in San Diego. But this is the first place I've tried in Pittsburgh and it's OK- it satisfies my cravings at least.   Remember: Cash only!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh. This place is actually pretty small and it looks a bit run down but they have good pho broth. There were not many customers on Sunday during lunch so we were able to seat wherever we wanted. The waitress was really nice and friendly. They bring you hot tea before you order.  We ordered spring rolls, thai tea, bun boe hue and pho. Everything was okay, nothing extraordinary. However, I was amazed that the broth for the pho tasted that good!! I did enjoy the broth, however, there was barely any pieces of meat. The meat was cut too thick and small in which they were supposed to cut it long and thin so that the soup can cook it with the heat. I also did not see much tripe in my soup.   It's definitely a good place to get pho but don't expect much protein in your soup. I would definitely try it again next time that I'm craving for pho."}
{"text":"I'm super surprised that this place is compared to Tram's as much as it is.  For me, they're not even on the same level.  Although the service was great and the free tea was a plus, the eating experience just wasn't at all up to par.  SPRING ROLLS: Mostly filler noodles and lettuce.  1 shrimp, halved, in each, where most places give you 2 or 3 whole ones.  The 2 short strips of pork pate were gamey and unappetizing.  No Thai basil or mint included at all.  And the dipping sauce, usually like crack for me, was the most disappointing part.  Super artificial tasting, it was reminiscent neither of peanut butter nor hoisin.  A true mystery.  BO BUN HUE: I hate to say this, but this was probably the worst rendition of this dish I've ever had.  It came super spicy, the way I requested it, but had no flavor otherwise.  Not even seasoned with enough salt.  I have nothing else to say about this.  It made me sad.  I hate to write a negative review of a local, family-run restaurant, but the food here was simply not very good.  A very disappointing last meal in Pittsburgh. :("}
{"text":"Straight outta Saigon, Pho Minh delivers when you are craving a sweet bowl o'Pho. The prices are dirt-cheap with no decor to speak of, but once that large bowl of Pho comes your way you can never believe that you will finish it until you drink from the bowl and wonder where it all went."}
{"text":"I had my second bowl of pho in Pittsburgh here, and although it was better than my first bowl, it was still pretty disappointing.  The broth is everything for pho.  Pho broth takes like nine hours to make.  The broth at Pho Minh is bland and almost clear in color.  Good broth should be dark and pungent, not like watered down chicken broth.  I had the combination beef with tripe pho, and there was literally about five small pieces of beef in there.  I guess since there is not much competition here for Vietnamese food, the $8 price tag is valid, even though that's much more than what I normally pay for good pho elsewhere.  We also ordered the deep fried spring rolls, and that was a disappointment too.  Mine was also still cold in the center, so I can only guess that they are frozen beforehand."}
{"text":"Price was cheap and service was good.  However the pho was merely okay. The broth wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. Pho wasn't quite hot enough either. I prefer Pho Van down the street, although it's a little pricier."}
{"text":"Glad to write this review to counter the only other one which is not so enthused... Pho Minh is a small family run place. Family is usually present and it's nice to see the kids hang out and help in the restaurant from time to time.    Meal starts with free tea served as you are seated. Food is slow to some out but they make it to order and it is a small staff so it's to be expected. It is definitely not a place to go if you need to get in and get out fast. This is a sit down and chat kind of place.   This is another of my \" I'm sick and need a spicy soup\" strongholds. I suggest the vermicelli soup. I used to stop in here just to buy a few fresh rolls and know I am among several others who do this.  Pho Minh won't blow you away it's just a good place to get some Vietnamese food and meet with friends- which is reason enough for me to return."}
{"text":"It is probably pretty obvious, but this place is quite similar to Tram's Kitchen. Small hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese place that from the outside doesn't look very impressive, but actually provides very good and cheap eats. Needless to say, their pho is quite impressive, and I enjoyed their lemongrass tofu appetizer as well. Their rice plate, at least the pork chop anyway, wasn't too impressive, so I'd probably say just stick with pho. It's pretty neat that they have more than just two or three options of each type of food--I think they do have a better selection than Tram's. Oh and their hot tea is very fragrant!"}
{"text":"No-frills hole in the wall with good food. Is it the best pho and fresh rolls I've had? Not by any means. But in a city without many Vietnamese options Pho Minh ranks pretty highly. The food is cheap, good, and will certainly warm you up on a cold day. The complementary green tea is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"We live just around the corner and waited way too long to come here. Tiny cash only spot that is full of delicious snacks. We got rare beef pho, grilled chicken and rice and also some pork spring rolls. The tea and warm food was all perfect and quickly prepared on a cold day. Im excited to return and try more things on the menu. This place is a gem, go check it out!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh by far back. I think I came here every Sunday for 4 months straight. Pho is the best in Pittsburgh. Crispy spring rolls incredible as well. Love the service. So happy this place exists. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Pho Minh is my neighbor! I must say i consider it one of the perks of where i live. I can remember some cold winter days driving home from work late at night, and calling in, most likely to be their last order. They always came through with one of my favorite winter comfort foods, their Special Spicy Soup. It's a good unpretentious place for locals to eat."}
{"text":"Tried a bunch of pho places in Pittsburgh and this is the one I keep coming back to. I haven't eaten in (only take out) but I did go in once when it was hot out and it was even hotter in the restaurant (no A/C?!)  Anyway, the deep fried spring rolls with pork are awesome! I also get the rare beef pho and it doesn't disappoint. Lots of noodles and a generous portion of beef. So delicious and broth is flavorful!   About to place another take out order right now :)  Oh, and cash only!"}
{"text":"I am really conflicted about this place.  I always have a great time when I go, the prices are reasonable (especially vegetarian) and the staff are super friendly.  That said, the food is OK.  It lacks some of the fresh condiments that I have grown so accustomed to with Vietnamese (basil, cilantro, mint, etc).  If you're looking for something to warm your soul on a 5 degree Pittsburgh day, this will do it.  BYOB before 9, no corkage fee."}
{"text":"No way, dudes. Go down the street and get some tastier food at Tram's Kitchen. The grub is better, the restaurant itself is a little cleaner (not saying much on either account), and the water even tastes better.   Really. I'm not joking about the water."}
{"text":"I love this place because it really reminds me of my time in Vietnam.  It's not the classiest joint by quite a stretch, but it took me back to sitting in Pho restaurants or street vendors in Saigon.  Man, I bet I ate at least four bowls of the stuff a day.  Take that for what you will, and I'm sure it's not for everybody.  For those peeps, there is a PF Changs at the Waterfront for you.  There are a few other Vietnamese places that I've tried and really enjoyed, but this place will always be close to my heart."}
{"text":"If you want PHO in Pittsburgh (Considering the Vietnamese Restaurant selections) I would choose this Place over Tram's Kitchen. The Pho here is more fragrant."}
{"text":"Wonderful Vietnamese restaurant. Small and they only take cash but I got past that with the food. Spring rolls were perfect. Peanut sauce was thinner than I like but good taste. Spring rolls were exactly how I like them. Had the Pho Doc Biet and it had plenty of beef steak, balls, tendons and even some chicken. Broth was amazing. So flavorful. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! My family and I have been coming here for years. The lemongrass tofu and papaya salad are my favorites! And the food is super affordable."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about this place at first because my friend and I were some of the few patrons there on a Monday evening for dinner - however my skepticism was proven unnecessary as the food here was absolutely incredible. We got the shrimp spring rolls to start off, which were simple but refreshing. I got the vermicelli noodles with grilled shrimp without the pork (#42) and was blown away. The amount of food you got for the price was awesome, the sauce on the side was delicious, and all of the flavors came together in a way that made the meal worthy of more than five stars. The waitress was sweet and helpful, the complementary hot tea was a nice touch, and the food left me feeling satisfied yet not overly full. It IS cash only, but this place definitely deserves more attention."}
{"text":"Ordered here for take out for work lunch. Food was ready in about 15 mins. Reasonable prices and portions. The chicken vermicelli's flavor was delicious. We all enjoyed our meals! Will order again - planning on trying the pho next time."}
{"text":"This is the best Pittsburgh has to offer in authentic Vietnamese.  I have eaten here several times in the past 7 years or so and have tried several of the items on the menu with success.  I like to order bun with chicken and pork spring rolls.  I also like the Hieu Tu.  Basically chicken pho but with chicken broth instead of beef.  This is typically my go to dish here and it's very good.  It's a small family run place without a lot of slick ambiance.  I wouldn't say you'd be wow'd by the decor but the service is friendly and efficient.  I am always glad I dined here."}
{"text":"Small but really nice. One of my favorite spots in town. Great food for the price and good service as well. I would recommend any of the phos and their fresh shrimp roll."}
{"text":"Oh holy baby, they have Bo Bun Hue spicy noodle soup!! And it's delicious and fresh. Overloaded with sliced beef and pork, with fat noodles, crunchy shallots and mung beans, crisply fresh basil, and a slick of spicy red paste stirred in. Enough heat to make you sniffle, but not so much that it overpowers the delicate broth.   I also got gai cuon chay tofu summer rolls, and they were SO fresh and slippery. They had obviously just been made for me. So good!  I'm downright thrilled to find this gem close to where I'm staying. Lucky me - I'm about to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty darn good pho. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large. The broth is very flavorful. My only gripe about this place is the lack of sliced jalapeno peppers. The seating is also quite cramped if you are coming with more than 2 people, but don't let that stop you from coming here. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to going to this place in the deep Pittsburgh winter to warm me up and clear up the nose."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a piping hot bowl of pho on a cold winter night. The restaurant even starts you out with a nice pot of tea once you come in.  Normally I just order a bowl of pho because I know it'll come out quickly but since I was starving today I decided to try out one of their pork+shrimp spring rolls too. In hindsight, that was a bad choice. Although they were supposed to be cold, it had a tingle of the ingredients inside being undercooked and the pork was actually just the same type of ham you would find in a salad bar. It wasn't what I expected.  I got the #19 (beef and tripe pho) and my friend got the #20 beef balls and it came out smelling pretty nicely and in an extra large bowl. The traditional uncooked bean curd and basil leaves accommodated it but as I started to eat more and more of it, I feel that the taste began to taste marginally...blander. Regardless, for $7.50 for the #19 and $7.25 for the #20, it was a pretty good value and I personally prefer this over its rival down the street, Tram's kitchen.  Just remember that this place is CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"First after sitting down and offered a menu, hot tea was served, nice.  I ordered the deep fried shrimp egg rolls. The egg rolls were made to order and fried crispy.  Dipping sauce was average. Ordered pho with chicken broth. I wished I would have ordered the beef broth instead. Service is really good.  Would return to eat there again."}
{"text":"I probably should've tried the pho but unfortunately I got the lemongrass beef with rice and I was not impressed. In fact I was quite disappointed. It also seemed expensive ($8) for quantity and quality of the dish. Based on all the other reviews, probably safe to stick to pho."}
{"text":"Craving for some more authentic Vietnamese pho. Yelped and found this place in Pittsburgh. Drive 80 miles from Morgantown, WV and found the pho is good. when I first walked in, I was a little bit skepical because everyone else was white! Lesson I learned before was that this could be a sign that this restaurant would be tailoring to american taste. But since I drove 80 miles already I decided to give it a try. the menu was pretty small comparing to mecca of Asian food (Southern California). Ordered the Pho dac bet. When the pho came out, i thought it would be like the Southern California size as the bowl was decent size. But the pho and soup were sitting at the bottom of the bowl, about 1/3 full. I was a bit disappointed. I loaded up my bean sprouts into the hot soup and did a quick stir to cook the raw thinly slice steak. The pho was actually pretty decent. The soup was flavorful and the pho was well cooked. Just wish the amount of pho and the ingredients could be more. I ended up having a roast beef sandwich at Nadine's afterward."}
{"text":"This is a very casual spot! Like a hole in the wall. I live in Atlanta but my friend bought me here since she live close by. We both ordered the same thing(Bun Bo Hue) except I op for phò in mine. Food  came out very quickly. And it's still hot! Even those I use chopsticks my whole life. But I still ask for silverware anyway(just to drive my friend crazy! ). And the service was great! Her tea pot was kept filled so do my water glass. The cashier/owner was very pleasant! She even gave my friend her opinion about me. So guys, be in your best behavior while you are there with a date!"}
{"text":"Okay real talk. I've been here now 3 times in the past two weeks and I'm hooked. This is probably one of my favorite places to get pho but I rarely venture all the way out there due to parking and the cash-only policy. It's not an excuse at all but that's my excuse. But whenever I do remember how much I love this place I then go overboard eating here. It's like I'm enchanted and I can't stop. I usually go for the pho with beef and tripe. The broth is delicious and the bowls are so big that I usually take some for lunch the next day. I like to order the appetizers of either the fried spring rolls with shrimp or the fried spring rolls with pork. Personally I like the fried spring rolls with shrimp the best but my partner likes the pork so sometimes I take one for the team and let him order what he likes. I know I'm just a good person like that. So I usually go with the pho which is amazing. There's usually a ton of tripe and beef so I don't feel like I'm just eating broth and noodles. The broth is so well done it's not salty at all which is my main concern with most broth-based items. I like that you get a cup and a kettle of tea when you get in there. Nothing says welcome like some fresh-brewed tea to sit while you're waiting for your spring rolls. The other day though I did try just some of their noodles instead of the pho. It just didn't hit me like the pho does. I'm going to keep with my favorite item on the menu and maybe venture out only if I'm really feeling it. That soup is too good to waste a trip up there and not get it. Maybe I should start thinking about ordering two meals just to be able to get my fix of Pho and to try other things. I can't wait for my next trip up there."}
{"text":"Tram's has better *ahem* \"atmosphere\".  Pho Minh has better Pho."}
{"text":"My go to place in Pittsburgh when I crave a really good meal! Their pho is second to none. What I also love is that all their food are fresh and delicious, and you can never pick a wrong one."}
{"text":"Waste of my time . The people who gave it good reviews must be related to them .Food was bland . Service wasn't great. Was never offered refills on drinks . The Thai tea tasted expired and funny. 4 of us ate there and none of us were happy with the food. The only good I can say is the shrimp fried rice tasted good but it had so much big cabbage mixed in with it , it was frustrating to eat ."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho and very reasonable prices. Excellent food. Authentic Pho - and my Vietnamese friends say this place is the real thing. Best bargain around."}
{"text":"Pho Minh is this cool little family-run noodle shop that is great for both sit-down eating and take-out.  The food isn't the best I've ever had, but its quality is consistently good, particularly for PIttsburgh.  This place would probably still get three stars in a town with a larger Vietnamese populatrion, and in the Burgh it deserves four.  It usually has a mixed crowd of Vietnamese patrons and non-Vietnamese.  This is the place I used to regularly turn to on non-Tuesday nights (they're closed) in mid-Feburary.  Until about three years ago, the broth was a little erratic.  Some days, it was quite flavorful and others watery.  Then, the in-laws showed up (I'm assuming from Vietnam), and the consistency and quality of the soup broth shot up.  The pho is significantly more flavorful than nearby (and only) competitor Tram's, and the family that runs it is much friendlier.  Food highlights -     The pho is above average, particularly if you order it with beef raw (aka \"rare\") on the side.     The green papaya salad with dried beef (#12) is spicy and fabulous.     The fried spring rolls, both with shrimp and vegetarian, are excellent.     The shrimp and BBQ pork dish (#43) is one of my wife's favorites.  Food cons -     The chicken pho is a bit meh.    The fresh spring rolls tend to have wrappers that are a bit too gummy and thick.  All I end up tasting is the roll, rather than the basil-sprout-crunch inside.    They always have omitted hot pepper slices from their tray of pho fixings, something I tend to enjoy.  Notes - If you tend to like the raw beef in your pho, it's often kept in the freezer (for Dept. of Public Health concerns).  Then, it's often best to order the pho to go, heat it up to near-boiling on your stove, then serve it so that the broth is at a temperature high enough to cook it in your bowl, giving the broth a nice beefy cloud, as well."}
{"text":"No fuss, the pho is great. I will certainly return, and totally recommend it to anyone looking for some good Vietnamese soup."}
{"text":"The pho broth was not made from real beef stock. It tasted like MSG soup, generic st best. The amount of soup, noodles, and raw veggies given were scarce compared to other pho places."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here based on the reviews. Unfortunately it does not live up to the ratings. Compared to many of the other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, this does not make the cut.   We had the rare beef, cooked beef PHO. The noodles were over cooked and broth was flat. We also ordered the grilled pork rice dish with fried egg. The egg was over cooked and rubbery, the pork was dry and not caramilzed.  We do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, which most of the time makes better food in my experience.  My hubby and I usually order the #2 spring rolls appetizer.  I always think they are fun to eat and we love the peanut sauce that comes with it.   I get the pho chin bc I need to eat well done food while pregnant.    I do agree with someone's review that the ingredients are a little lacking.  Also, we hear a microwave \"ding,\" everytime we're there.  Not sure what they are microwaving.  Maybe the rice noodles?  Overall, we go back because the service is pretty quick and it's a lowkey place.  It's a plus that this small place has a bathroom, but the meter in the street parking always seems to give us problems."}
{"text":"Mr. J and I have been to Pho Minh a bunch of times and I'm finally getting to review it! I'm not sure what it is, but I always feel comfortable here. The staff is very friendly and eager to please. Pho Minh isn't fancy by any stretch, but it's cozy, inexpensive, and delicious.   I don't stray from the pho menu. I've tried the beef and also the pork with rice and egg noodles and they are all fantastic! Pho is all about the condiments and with your pho you get a good portion of fresh basil, lime wedges, and fresh sprouts. The tables are also decked out with soy sauce, fish sauce, red chili paste, sriracha, and a sweet teriyaki-type sauce.  I'm still a bit flabbergasted at the people walking in Tram's door instead of this one. Oh well, less crowds for me to deal with!"}
{"text":"The lemongrass tofu and vermicelli are always my go to.   The only issue is I don't always carry cash and I crave this place at least once a week.   Small dining area is a little awkwardly quiet, but it's worth it because the food is great."}
{"text":"I came here for my first time ph on a whim. I was the only customer at the time, eating by myself, but seriously no complaints.  I love offal and was happy to see tripe as an option - will be back for more.  It is a low-frills restaurant, but that helps the food and friendly service shine. I'd love to come back with friends, BYOB and enjoy the food with company."}
{"text":"Two of my friends and I decided to stop by here for their birthday dinner! They're both Vietnamese so they're both have high standards for Vietnamese restaurants because they just feel that no food is as good as their homemade food. However, they felt that this place was pretty good!! I just got the Pho dac biet (pho Minh) which has all the different types of meat, but my friends got some other spicy noodle soups which were also really good! I also ordered a side of the #1 which I believe was shrimp wrapped in grilled pho Minh beef. That was delicious and so was the sauce!   We were the only customers for awhile which was surprising for a Saturday night, but people started rolling in by the time we were finishing up. Our server could've been more polite and welcoming, however she was very attentive to our table. Food came out in a decent time, hot and flavorful! Prices aren't really horrible either. My portion size was fine however there were some inconsistencies within our table. One of the people in our party received a noticeable smaller portion of noodles and toppings compared to the others, but it was still good nonetheless. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE noodle soups.  From cold winter nights to a late night snack in the summer, a big bowl of pho always hits the spot (as does ramen or beef noodle soup, but that'll be for other reviews).  Pho Minh serves up pho with debatably the most fragrant beef broth in Pittsburgh.  Their pho also always comes with sliced rare beef, which is sometimes cooked well done at other pho places (COUGH TRAM's KITCHEN COUGH).  Also, they do some of the \"unique\" parts such as tripe, which I am a fan of.  Service is reasonably fast, the atmosphere is reasonably dingy in a comforting homey way, and the food is tasty.  Yes, if I want some fresh spring rolls (Gi cun), I'll probably head to Tram's, but when I want pho, I want no nonsense pho, and Pho Minh is the place to be.  On a sidenote; their other dishes are pretty good too, but for me I'm heading to Pho Minh for their pho."}
{"text":"This was a sub-par Vietnamese place. I got the grilled pork with vermicelli. The portion size was very small and the accompanied sauce was a little too sweet for my liking. The place does look and feel authentic though.   My friend and I had an interesting experience there. We are convinced that the cashier was in a fight with her mom, who worked in the kitchen, over my friend's order of a Thai iced tea. At one point she just stormed off and came back with milk. We were highly amused.  I wouldn't come back here since there are a plethora of other Vietnamese restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
