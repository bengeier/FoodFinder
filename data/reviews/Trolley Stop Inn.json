{"text":"After two bad experiences in three visits I felt compelled to write a review. They were bad experiences not due to the food but due to the service. The food isn't anything to write home about but it's good standard bar food fare. Today's visit was at the bar. When I sat down there were five others at the bar - all of them either eating already  or just having drinks. Despite having a new face at the bar  the bartender ignored me and gathered  another round for some of the patrons before even acknowledging the fact that I was sitting there.  I I grabbed my own menu and after getting her attention I placed a simple order of six wings and a few soft tacos. The gentleman next to me placed an order of 12 wings immediately after my order. My soft tacos and his 12 wings were delivered simultaneously. After starting my last soft taco I asked the bartender if she could check on the status of the rest of my order. She went back to the kitchen and informed me the wings would be out in a minute. I believe she mistakenly forgot to put my wing order in  but I took her word for it . Nearly ten minutes passed and I asked for my check. In her defense the bar was slightly busy at that point there was a new party of about 5 that sat at the bar. She noticed I never got my wings and just offered to take them off my check instead of going to get them to go. This was almost an exact repeat of what happened the last time I was there right down to the missing wings. It appears they are constantly understaffed."}
{"text":"Hair in my pizza. Wings were well cooked but not spicy or flavorful. I never write reviews but I had to. Wife and I wanted to give them another try. Never again."}
{"text":"I frequent this place I absolutely love the food pizza is amazing along with the Italian hoagie and steak Hoagie are some of the best around also if you're looking for good Wings they have those as well just went through a huge remodel the bar and dining area is very nice along with the restrooms so I would suggest if you're in the area to stop and grab a beer or bite to eat whichever you prefer."}
{"text":"Tried this one twice, one bad experience is not indicative of a mediocre restaurant, however, the food was very average on both occasions and getting drinks refilled was next to impossible!"}
{"text":"By far the best Pizza and Wings. When busy there can be a wait but worth it good local bar with great food."}
{"text":"I would love to find a mama papa joint that to took pride in their food. Frozen chicken patty for chicken parm which was Sandwich size. Frozen onion rings. Both of these products should be made fresh it would be cheaper for the restaurant. Hope you with their expansion they will get an oven so they don't have to deep-fried these products."}
{"text":"Standard dive bar in the South Hills.  Good pub grub (wings, pizza, hoagies, etc.)    They are currently going through an expansion, since they bought the space that the Co-Go's had next door.  It will be interesting to see the direction the place goes when the renovation is completed.  I think there is a chance it could move away from the dive-like state it currently qualifies as.    Overall, not a bad spot if you are looking for a beer and some pub grub.  It currently has a limited number of TV's so I can't say its a great place to watch a game, but if you are looking for a cheap beer and cheap decent pub food stop in."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch with my wife. Nice place. I had the fish sandwich and it was huge and very good. Plus the onion rings were some of the best I've had. My wife had the white pizza and said it was great. Our waitress was the only one working and she was very good and very nice.  The restroom was clean as a whistle."}
{"text":"It is WAY out in the South Hills (Bethel Park), and it's nothing fancy, but I liked their tacos (less than a buck each!) and the nicely battered fish sandwich I ordered. The fries could have been better, though (undercooked a little). Our server was a total doll. The decor is trolley-themed and includes an actual trolley that was repurposed. I'm not sure it's worth the drive from where we live, but it's pretty good and relatively quiet also."}
{"text":"This place is pretty far out on 88, but if you're near it, do yourself a favor and stop in, grab a table and order a pizza. 5 stars for the pizza, three stars for the bar! This isn't the NY style pizza, with the thin crust that you can read through. This is Pittsburgh pizza, the kind that will put weight on you, nice thick doughy crust, chewy inside, crunchy crust. Delicious sauce, not too sour, not too sweet, just right in my opinion. Good flavors too, hints of garlic, basil, a touch of oregano. The cheese is piled on thick, the top is browned and if you get toppings, expect a lot. We had it with mushrooms and black olives, (my personal favorite) earthiness from the schrooms, acidic from the olives, combine that with the creamy cheese and it's a heavenly combo, and there was plenty of toppings. Enough so, that you weren't stealing toppings from your next slice.  I've heard the wings are outstanding, never tried them though.  Overall, this is another Pittsburgh shot and a beer, Yinzer bar, with sporting events on in the evening, and soap operas, Judge Judy, and Divorce Court on in the afternoons for the retired guys who hang out all day nursing a beer."}
{"text":"Although it says the Trolley Stop is in Bethel Park, it's in the far, far reaches of the area so don't be surprised if you think you missed it- just keep going down Route 88 and you will see it eventually. We stopped in here after a day of skiing at Mystic Mountain since it is right down the road from my boyfriend's home and we were famished-and needing to see the last period of the hockey game play out!   It was pretty crowded around 8:30pm this past Saturday, however, we did spy 2 seats at the bar and took up in those immediately. There was a group having some kind of maybe awards celebration-they had trophies and there were probably about 20 of them gathered in the middle area. I'm all for celebrations but I think several of them were waaaay overserved (stumbling and not being able to walk was my first clue). A few of them kept interrupting the bartender about the jukebox when she was trying to take care of other customers (namely us and the two other couples at the bar) which was pretty annoying for both us and the bartender.   We were served our first drinks fairly quickly (draft list very minimal but they had some decent bottles) and given menus. She wasn't able to get back over to us for about 15 minutes though so our food order was put in quite late (and again, we were famished). Although pizzas were on special for $8 (large 1 topping), considering we had pizza for lunch we decided to go for something else. I ordered the spicy chicken wrap (grilled chicken, lettuce,tomato, and frank's red hot) served with a side of ranch. I just went with the chips because I didn't feel like fries-but maybe I should have since they were Lay's and I really dislike that particular brand of chip. The wrap was decent bar food-nothing special but because I was so starved, it did hit the spot.  My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger with fries. He said it was good but didn't say much else. He agreed he was starving and that hit the spot. Total bill for 4 beers and the 2 sandwiches- $31.00, pretty good I'd say. I would come back here again in a pinch, but I'm not going to hurry back for any reason. They did have ample tvs, however, me personally, I like to sit at the bar for sporting events and this bar leaves much to be desired so it might be awhile before coming back here to partake in a Pens game."}
{"text":"Can't  wait you all come back. Great teas coffee   n food was there sat before Flood   will be back"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to go, but since their expansion it has gone down hill fast.  On a few recent trips it has taken 15-20 minutes just to get our drink orders.  The wait staff seems completely overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I love the Italian hoagie here, the dressing they put on it is incredible. Good service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Far, far, far, FAR out on seemingly endless Library Road, you'll find within a converted trolley a no-frills, suburban family restaurant. A bar and a diner in one quaint package, Trolley Stop Inn is currently being remodeled and augmented as I write this.   Why did we ever make such a long drive to try Trolley Stop Inn? Hell, I'm surprised the T runs all the way out here. We were only 3 miles from Finleyville!  Recently, I did a search on Castle Shannon's Trolley Barn Eatery (which we eventually went to and reviewed), and Trolley Stop Inn came up. Thus, I had discovered another hidden boondocks establishment to review.   When we walked through the doors, we were greeted by the lovely Savannah, our effectual waitress/part-time wildlife rescuer and noticed a mixture of young and old, some gossiping, chortling about last night's misadventures, others fixated on tight, thriller-diller football games.   TSI is supposedly known for their meatballs and pizza, so I went with a meatball starter and a small, plain pizza for the entree.   Moist, plump globes of beef, bread powder, and spice were topped with a mozzarella/provolone blend and slathered in a pungent, decadent marinara that challenges that which Pasta Too makes. The reputation is deserved.  My pizza contained that same cheese and deadly red gravy and had a crust with edges that were akin to a pretzel/sourdough breadstick hybrid in taste and texture. My only fault with the pie itself was that the bottom was a bit sodden and droopy, perhaps from oversaucing (it was a bit much). Nevertheless, this was a more than edible pie that required utensils.   A trio of 99 cent tacos were shared by Kay and I and reminded me of the kind made by my dear mother: soft tortillas, seasoned, crumbly beef, shredded cheese, fresh vegetables, sour cream, and salsa.   No desserts were on the menu, unfortunately.   TSI may not be worth driving as far as we did (we didn't realize HOW far out it is!), but y'know...the local residents are lucky to have a homey, affordable place such as this, one where you can stay as long as you like, strike up friendly conversations,  and gobble on some very good pub grub while you're at it."}
{"text":"Well I've tried this three times before writing this review and all three times it has been sub par at best. Yesterday was the last time. As of this morning two out of the four of us has had gastrointestinal issues.  Food is reasonably priced, but it seems very bland and dependent on frozen components. Our waitress couldn't care less and kept complaining about how tired she was and her back hurting. My burger was quite honestly nasty, one of our group had a burnt (not toasted) bun for his buffalo chicken sandwich and the chips they served were stale.   Best thing I can say about the trolley stop is to drive on by....."}
{"text":"Don't do it!!  Keep driving!  You'll find better food in the garbage of other restaurants around the way. Wife ordered a turkey club and they had the nerve to serve her spoiled meat. I had a hamburger, and they managed to screw that up too. So very sad ... Could be good. Looks like a good place to have a beer, but make sure you drink from the bottle not in a glass, unless you like diseases. And get your shots up to date before entering this establishment."}
{"text":"Great burgers & a nice variety of wings.  One of the better non smoking local spots.  If you are in the area and you are looking to avoid the chain burger & wing places, hit it.  In Bethel Park near the Library T stop. 6 packs to go as well."}
{"text":"We just went here for the first time for dinner and some drinks on a Friday night.  One of my friends had said good things so I was excited to try itvout.  The waitress was pleasant,  but basically forgot about us after the first 20 minute of our visit. Sandwiches were reasonably priced.  They come with chips and a pickle.  For an  additional 1.75 you get a small order of fries, but lose both the chips and the pickle. They advertised happy hour on the website from 5-7 but the  waitress said they only had a late night happy hour after 10. We both ordered captain and cokes. Or drinks were finished a couple minutes into our meal and we were not approached for refills for another 40 minutes after we finished them, and thatwas by the bussboy! So we had to finish our meals with no drinks to wash the food down.  I expect when I am at a bar to at least have the opportunity to order drinks.  This experience ruined the rest of my night."}
{"text":"I mean it's ok...not great not shitty but ok...waitresses are overwhelmed most of the time, so it makes it hard for them to get the food out while still warm.  Pizza can be great and also can be mediocre at best.  I've asked for them to bake longer on occasion and this seems to do the trick.  Seems like they want to skimp on the sauce also.  Wings, same scenario, I've gotten them and they were on verge of being cold.  Spaghetti special on Wednesdays, is a good deal.  Again, although 2 people at table ordered spaghetti dinner, one was cold and other lukewarm."}
{"text":"It's just sad because of the prime location right near the trolly stop and all the refurbishments they've made to the place. They have an ice bar! That is really cool. The menu and the food is just bleh though. They need to overhaul that big-time. It needs an update and more flavor. I can't speak for wait staff, but would you go above and beyond if you were  carting bleh to the table order after order?"}
