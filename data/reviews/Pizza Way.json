{"text":"There are two things in life that I enjoy more than sex:  1. Fried chicken 2. Pizza  Pizzaway literally and figuratively delivers both at a reasonable price. The pizza crust is nice and crispy, not greasy, and the chicken has a nice crunch to it too. It's also got some spice to it too. If all they served was fried chicken, this place would still be a popular joint.  To top it all off the place is halal.  Pizzaway easily has the best pizza on the snowy coast. If you haven't tasted it yet, do yourself a solid and head on over and try a slice."}
{"text":"The pizza here is just delicious! I usually go with the mexican pizza as they offer a halal variety. The dough tastes just perfect. The burgers are also grilled to my liking. They use cavendish fries, which is good if you like them. They have deals almost every day and the prices are incredible for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"Pizza Way! Mmhh, plutôt moyen! C'est pas la meilleure pizza que j'ai pu manger, la pâte ça peut passer mais je trouve que le reste est sec, et les ingrédients sont pas hyper frais, leurs tomates ou poivrons ne me paraissent pas fraîchement coupés du matin.   Par contre, pas cher du tout, un peu plus de 5$ pour 2 pointes de pizza et le service est rapide.   Mais, honnêtement, je préfère acheter une pizza au supermarché."}
{"text":"They reopened another restaurant like 1 block away.  Service was meh. No hello.  Typical pizza that doesn't look too appetizing,sauce was lacking, so after a few bites i didn't want to eat it anymore.  One of the few pizza locations in cotes des neiges,so if u really are craving then i guess it's better than nothing."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza and hamburger places on cote des neiges!  Their hamburgers are really the best! Burger and chicken burgers are very tasty! Prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious!  Their pizza is great especially the spicy Mexican pizza!  Poutine fries are also delicious!"}
