{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was great! Restaurant hard to find as it is in business/industrial  plaza with entrance off Scotia street, but worth the effort!  Check hours when open before you leave to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Went to this place with  2 other guys for some serious BBQ treats,  boy oh boy were we disappointed!  Food was severely substandard and don't mention the atmosphere. The atmosphere was like a school cafeteria / warehouse with zero effort to even paint the walls.  The server was polite and tried, however it was very difficult to recover based on the food quality and cafeteria style atmosphere.  Past reviews must have been done by friends and family members of the restaurant owner!  We were not impressed, would not recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are within an hour of this place and craving BBQ...  Get in the car and drive.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200.  I was pretty skeptical especially upon pulling up to this joint - located in a south Whitby industrial park.  The inside actually had me laugh out loud when I walked through the door.  There is a big counter and some patio furniture where you can \"eat in\".  Just as I was about to do a 180 and head home, the smell hit... The rich smokey real BBQ smell.  While my brain said \"go\" my taste buds said \"stay\".    We ordered ribs, pulled pork, beans, fries and coleslaw.  As a self professed \"fat boy\" I have eaten my share of ribs from Texas, Florida to many! many ribfests.   These rank up there with the best, succulent, perfectly cooked and the spice is fantastic.    Pulled pork... Wow.  Honestly the best I have ever eaten. Tangy, melt in your mouth goodness.    Beans were also great, and i swear they had pulled pork in them!    Everything went down a treat with our visiting expanded family...they all raved about he food.  We'll definitely be back..  Also for Durham region yelpers they have some great weekday specials... Considering the food quality... They are total deals.  Check out their website. Mmmmmm good!"}
{"text":"this place is great!| amazingly fresh food which you can eat there or take out. And they have pre-cooked brisket, pulled pork and chicken wings that can easily be heated up if you're going to a bbq or camping. The Holy Habanero sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, so good both my guest and myself purchased each a pound of it to take home. And he is a BBQ wizard."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Buster Rhinos for the past few years, and also keep a stock of the vacuum sealed meats in my freezer. Can't say enough good things about this place, nor anything that hasn't already been said by anyone else. Ribs, pulled pork, brisket are all amazing, but I generally end up going for wings & hush puppies ... to DIE for. Oh, and Habanero vinegar on the fries ... 'nuff said!   Darryl himself is always willing to go above & beyond for his customers and his food, which itself says alot about this place. I would seriously go to the ends of the earth for this BBQ, and feel that I do having to come from Mississauga :)"}
{"text":"It is a long drive from Toronto to Whitby just to have Buster Rhino's smoked BBQ Baby back ribs. But the drive is well worth it. We usually have delicious house made fries with the ribs. We also order a pound of naked chicken wings with house made cabbage slaw. Be sure to put the habenero hot sauce on the fries not the ribs."}
{"text":"Went to the Whitby location 3 times. Finally gave up. The place is not a place to bring your family. The \"sides\" that come with the ribs or wings are a moving target, and change with each visit. The price I was charged twice was changed (more added on) while waiting for my takeout.  Twice they screwed up my order, and once they had no fries! They said the \"other store\" (Oshawa I presume) needed them, so somebody came and got them! When I expressed my displeasure at one or another of the amateurish efforts at service, they could care less. The store itself is NOT a restaurant and, other than takeout, you don't want to eat there. Take your order and run! The staff seems to WANT to do well, but they just don't seem to know HOW. I went 3 times because, while pricy, the food and sauce were tasty. But you know what? At the end of the day, service DOES count for something, and the abysmal attention to this detail, combined with the unappetizing look of the place, has driven us away for good. No management of any effectiveness on site. Buh-bye."}
{"text":"My son and I shared the Friday special rack of ribs with one side.  We also bought one drink to share and in total it cost us about $20.  Darrell's mother has recently started running the Thickson and Wentworth location.  She was really friendly and gave us a really nice amount of ribs and fries to share.  The ribs were delicious they were fall off the bone and had a nice smoky sauce on them.  The fries where amazing fresh and thick cut.  My son and I will definitely go back next time we will be trying the sandwiches."}
{"text":"It's been 2 weeks since my first bbq experience and I had eating more on my mind. I was already in pickering so why not drive the little distance to whitby for some more. Still amazing I'm going to waste so much gas just for this meat!!  I got my brisket, I took one home for my boyfriend and the guy at the counter gave me the sealed bag the meat is stored in and buns and sauce so I could make it when I got home without it being dry.  I had already paid and apparently the cold one costs less so he refunded me almost 5 bucks. Such a nice guy!!!!  I'll be back!! You should go too :)"}
{"text":"I work just down the street from the awesome BBQ joint, so it happens to be one of my favourite lunch spots.  So far, I have tried the pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket sandwich and the ribs--all three are outstanding.  Their beef brisket, in my humble opinion, is probably the best in Canada.  Yeah, I know, we are not a BBQ country.. I'm not GTA for Memphis.  But I've been to many so called BBQ joints in and around Toronto, and Buster Rhino's, along with The Stockyards, easily rank at the top.  Fries are the thicker style, and are excellently crunchy.  These are proper hand cut twice fried fries by the way, not the feeble frozen ones.  They also come salted from the kitchen while they are still piping hot out of the fryer--something that a lot of restaurants miss.  Their baked beans and coleslaw is excellent too, but if I were you, just do the fries.  Unless, of course, you decide to get a side of coleslaw to put inside of your pulled pork sandwich, like I always do :)   The only side dish that I have not enjoy were the hush puppies... but I've never had hush puppies before, so I didn't have anything to compare to either.  Their homemade BBQ sauce is also excellent.  Don't be a wimp and get the habanero hot.  Really, it's not that hot.. it's just right hot.  It won't kill your taste buds or anything.   So everything is great, but the only reason for not getting a perfect score is the decor.  It's basically a shop/warehouse feeling inside.  Hey, I work at a steel plant, so it doesn't really bother me that much during lunch hour, but it's definitely not a date night kind of place.  I am told though, that a new location in Oshawa is now open and that it is a proper waiter serviced restaurant, with some new outrageous menu items.  Very looking forward to checking that location out shortly.  Just want to also add in a note:  the owner & the staff here are truly wonderful.  Once I left my wallet at the restaurant, but they made the effort of calling me long distance to have it returned.  They even called back a second time after the person who answered the phone hung up thinking that it was a prank call.  Now that is customer service that is above & beyond!!"}
{"text":"Why don't they busta'a' move and come to Toronto.  There are many creepy empty store fronts on the Danforth just begging for someone to give them life and I bet the rent would be the same as this industrial strip court in Whitby.  The bbq was fantastic, reminded me of some that I have had in Florida.  The pull pork sandwich has a subtle flavour of smoke with just a small portion of homemade Buster bbq sauce.  It doesn't smother the thing.  The full rack of ribs are melt in your mouth off the bone.  They are not saucy.  I bought a bottle of the hot sauce and used it for dipping them.  The fries are homemade enough said they're good & coleslaw like you used to taste at family picnics years ago.  1 pulled pork sand full rack of ribs w/fries&coleslaw one bottle of homemade bbq sauce 2 waters 1 pop  $36....worth the drive to whitby.  they also sell meat you take-out and bbq at home check website."}
{"text":"Great take away!  Bbq to go! Nothing else to cover that hasnt already been covered except that this location is way better than the North Oshawa location. Its bbq at its best... too bad it hasn't got a licensed location where you can enjoy a beverage and some great bbq!"}
{"text":"Really good food and wings, I usually get take out and it's always so flavourful and juicy. They have a lot of sauce options and food options. Would totally recommend if you are looking for some good flavourful bbq."}
{"text":"I make the trek from GTA to pick up this stuff. I've had the ribs. Brisket and pulled pork. It's worth it to grab a bunch of frozen meat and store it in the freezer. Cooking it in the bag is convenient and quick. Tastes like ya just made it fresh. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time eating at the King Street location or any location. Beautiful sunny day on the outdoor patio, took 35 minutes to bring us our lunch. Pulled pork sandwich was dry, not much BBQ sauce, served on a plain hamburger bun with a side of cole slaw that had no dressing in it. Very disappointing! The hot sauce was great though! I will try the north Oshawa location before I give up on Buster Rhino's"}
{"text":"I've been to Buster Rhino's many times and really enjoy their pulled pork, which is my favourite. Many places soak their pulled pork in some nondescript BBQ sauce and you can't even taste the smokiness in the pork. However, Buster Rhino's does is just perfect. I've also tried their ribs and really enjoy them as well!  Recently, I finally had the chance to try the new Fried Smoked Chicken, which is only available on Wednesdays for $9.99 (3 pieces of chicken, 1 side order and 1 drink). Since they fry it fresh, you'll have to wait at least 10 minutes for it. I was amazed that you could really taste the smoked flavour in the chicken, and the batter is very unique and tasty. That being said, it was quite rich and very greasy, so this isn't something that I'll have very often. I'll stick with the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Arguably the best BBQ in the city.  Prior to the arrival of The Stockyards and Barque, the Toronto BBQ scene was a massive disaster and disappointment and the problem I think , was two-fold:  1) The restaurants have never actually eaten good BBQ or they gave up on putting the time in to making good BBQ.  2) Most people don't know what good BBQ actually is, so they tend to think that anything drowned in BBQ is good.  So wrong.  All the popular BBQ joints were terrible. Nothing was actually smoked. Meat was either dry or was steamed or boiled until it wasn't, but completely void of flavour and God forbid you serve meat with a rub and no sauce. Heresy!  Buster Rhinos was the first place that did southern-right. Killer dry rub ribs with lots of smoke and moist pulled pork that melted in your mouth. The brisket, admittedly on my visit, was mid-range. It was smoked and it was flavourful, but it was a little dry. And all the sammies are served on plain, white buns. JUST THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE!  The owner, Darryl, actually stopped by no to ask how everything was, but to find out how we heard about it, and what we know about BBQ. He actually really cares about his product, what his customers think and does it at an affordable price point. How he makes any money off  three pieces of chicken, a side & a drink for $9.99 or the Friday $14.99 full rack special, I don't know!  And with the announcement that they'll be open on weekends, my return business is pretty-much secured."}
{"text":"Meat dreams are made of these.....I think this was Annie's original intent on these lyrics. I believe that the reason they were changed was some angry vegetarian stepped in with a broccoli wand and stopped the masterpiece. Who then would preach the truth, and tell us about the real vegetables in life - MEAT?! Oh, Darryl, that is who. And get back Christine C., you are already married. If he wasn't married, I would have married him right then and there. As you can tell from the look on my face in Christine's photos, I was in meat heaven. I have discovered heaven, and f**k me - it was right near me when I lived in the hell hole shwa, and I didn't even know it!   This place deserves my highest rating of SLAP MY ASS AND CALL ME SALLY. I was in such food nirvana that you could have slapped my ass and called me Sally, and I honestly wouldn't have noticed.   This place is actually set up as a meat processing plant in a strip mall. So austere and non descript, that you wouldn't even notice it. My favourite \"bells and whistles\" in the place are the 2 jiffy pops hanging over the doorway. When someone from our religious group (aka the meat samplers) asked Darryl why there was jiffy pop above the doorway, he said it is a redneck fire alarm.  If it gets too hot in there, the popcorn she start a popping.   For $30, we feasted. There was so much meat, I couldn't eat it all. And, I was really glad I ate a salad before I went to meat heaven.   The bacon candy I think was one of my favs. Buster's makes their own bacon. Yes meat worshipers, you heard it right - their own bacon. The bacon candy is achieved by cooking the bacon with a rub and brown sugar mixture to create a bit of a sugary exterior. Simple and divine.   The Jalapeno pops were so good. The only bits of green in sight! Again, bacon was the the blanket of love around these puppies.   The bacon explosion was so over the top decadent that it was amazing. You will see from Christine's photos, that NONE of the items were greasy. And being served on paper plates, you would spot the grease from a mile away. The in house bacon and long and slow processes really aid in this pork defying amazement.   The brisket. Oh, sweet Jesus, it was so good. Thinly sliced and succulent. This is the stuff Annie Lennox was singing about. I tried it sans sauce, and it was excellent. I tried it with sauce, again, excellent. The meat God, Darryl, informed us that Canadians like our meat saucy, and that by default we put sauce on smoked meat. I tried each of the items with and without the sauce. The meat is so tender and has such a great smoky flavour that they really can go without.   The pulled pork, again, amazing. This one I did prefer with the sauce (and what a sauce Buster's makes!! Wow!!). The coleslaw really adds a nice crunchy texture to the meat. Again, great.   The ribs were so juicy and smokey. I preferred them with the sauce as well. But with the quality of meat, these bones stand on their own - no sauce required. The hush puppies that came with them were absolutely amazing. If you like corn bread, you will love these.   The zinger of the night was the smoked Mars bar. It reminded me of smores around the campfire at Brownie camp. Delish and smokey. The way God (Darryl, and Annie Lennox) truly intended them to be.   At our table of four [Christine, her husband Dennis, my mom (aka The Mulva) and myself], we all fell in love with Buster's and his fine selection of meat. I am so pleased to say that another location has opened up (this one in the shwa at Taunton and Simcoe) and it is opened on weekends, where this southern Whitby one is not.   I cannot say enough about the quality of the meats here (all local Ontario meats).  Look at the pictures. Too bad we don't have scratch and sniff abilities on our monitors....."}
{"text":"I went back to Buster Rhino's today to try their newest creation, Smoked Fried Chicken.  That's right, SMOKED Fried Chicken.  It's only available on Wednesdays, & you get three pieces of chicken, a side & a drink for $9.99 + those damned taxes.  The chicken is quite different from any other type of chicken I've ever had, & it's absolutely delicious.  The skin was nice & crispy, & the chicken was really tender & juicy, but the heady, smoky flavour is what really sets it apart from any other chicken.  It's a unique combination that, for lack of a better description, rocks.  If you're in the mood to try something new on a Wednesday, this chicken should definitely be on your list!"}
{"text":"I love their beef ribs, pulled beef on a bun and hush puppies.  Such a treat and so fortunate to have buster rhinos in the GTA"}
{"text":"On the rare occasions that i am in Whitby, I try to make it to Buster Rhinos.  In fact I haven't eaten anywhere else in Whitby in the last two years.  The ribs are great and the pulled pork is good too.  I keep meaning to try the brisket, but I cannot get past those two.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ place hidden away in a commercial / industrial area. Visited a coworker on our way through. We both ordered the brisket sandwich which was awesome. I ordered a poutine side and it was also great. There is no frills at this place, it's pretty simple but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Meat. Sleep. Pray. Then give thanks to the higher powers for a dude named Darryl Koster (pink hair and all) for his love of creating the perfect smoked meat. Life is just too damn short not to eat such good bbq. Or as one 'smokin dude I know and adore would say....\"Put a little south in your mouth!\".   Picture this. Out in the burbs. In a meat processing plant. Sitting in a room with 20 other strangers. You have one thing in common. You've come to eat smoked meat. Not just any smoked meat....Buster Rhino's smoked meat and more importantly hosted by the whacked up, jacked up, smoke head we know as Darryl Koster. Any guy who'd take a couple of pounds of Italian (pronounce that Eye-talian) ground sausage meat, wrap it in bacon and 'cue it is just one step over the smoked up line of sanity. If Darryl wasn't already married him I'd scoop him up in a second.   The girls who love to eat the meat met up (or in this case meat up) to indulge in one of Darryl's private tastings. For thirty bucks we not only go to gobble up meat but we got educated a ton about the difference of bbq. From the low and slow philosophy to the should I pull the membrane off those ribs to the difference between back ribs and side ribs....it was a moment.   So this was the menu....started with Pig Candy. Oh gawd. Take me now I'm in bacon heaven. Then it was Atomic Buffalo Turds. Yup, you read that right. Jalapeno peppers, halved, stuffed with cream cheese and then wrapped in bacon and bbq'd. Oh like that wasn't orgasmic enough. We moved on to Bacon Explosion. That would be ground sausage meat wrapped up in bacon and sliced like one of those jelly roll cakes. The sausage meat is well seasoned with fennel and marries well with the bacon.   Then comes the smoked brisket on a bun, sided with simply some of the 'effing best potato salad I've ever eaten in a commercial setting. It was chock full of sweet potatoes, green onions and hard boiled eggs.  Potatoes are perfectly cooked and the spud salad is perfectly dressed with mayonnaise & mustard....not gloopy or cloying. Darryl encourages us to try the meat before we decide to slather sauce on top. Taste the smoke, taste the true flavour of the meat in its pureness. After that if you want sauce he's ok with that.   Moving on comes the smoked pulled pork. Natch there is coleslaw slaw on the side. Darryl informs us the traditional way of eating PP is to slather the slaw on top of the pork. My husband Dennis is beginning to moan. I'm looking around the room wondering if they have one of those emergency CPR resuscitation machines. If not I'll just leave him on the floor until I'm finished my sandwich.   This just ain't human. Out comes the ribs and the hush puppies. No, these arent' those nerdy Hush Puppies that you put your feet. Hush puppies are corn bread dollops deep fried and served on the side of the smoked ribs. Now be forewarned. If saucy is your trip then these ribs ain't gonna work for you. This is about rub....and low and slow cooking. It is a snout-full of smoke. Dennis declares these are the best ribs he's ever tasted. I'm wounded....my ribs have always been the best he's ever tasted. I'm calling my lawyer first thing on Monday morning. I make a point of unplugging the charger on the plant defibrillator machine.   The swan song in this bbq extravaganza....smoked Mars bars. Yeah, you read that right. Darryl freezes them and them they put 'em on the cue. Check out the pics. You'll see the grill marks on the back of the bars.   Ok, so what did I learn? There is food life in the 'burbs....I mean we are talking serious smoking effing cue here people. My priceless moment.....getting to meet (meat) Shari M's mom. Meat rules.  Meat. Sleep. Pray....for a chance to get out to Buster Rhino's."}
{"text":"I'm torn with this place. I arrived on a Thursday night -- hard as hell to find the entrance...its on the side street of the side street -- and there was no lineup. Other reviews will probably talk of its spartan interior. The staff were friendly and uber efficient. I had my rack of rib dinner with fries in a second. I think next time I will ask for wet ribs though. By the time I got them home, the ribs (dry ribs) were tough to chew and bone, bone dry. I know rib-ivores debate wet versus dry. I think I am leaning more to wet. I'll have to ask next time. I will go back again. The fries are perfect. The coleslaw a nice blend of tangy and sweet, but the ribs left me wanting.  I'm giving it three stars because the spartan appeal only goes so far, it is truly like entering a warehouse/kitchen. And, the ribs left me wanting. The staff, however are completely five star. Thanks."}
{"text":"High marks for the food, value, and friendly service! The ambiance could use some work but for the purpose of this review, I'll limit my comments to the food.  I came here for the first time today and was greeted in a very friendly and inviting manor. The weekly Friday special of a full rack of ribs with fries and coleslaw was recommended for only $18.99. Sold!  Good call! The meat was tender and moist and came off the bone easily. The bourbon sauce had the right kind of sweetness that I like. A full rack was almost a little more than I could handle. Almost. Unfortunately, I prefer my fries a little crisper and my coleslaw a little less crunchy. Minor details. I finished everything and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love their food: love them! Truly great BBQ. Have had everything many times and introduced friends and family to their food either by taking them there or giving them Buster Rhino's gift \"buckets\" for Xmas. Everyone loves it. Also, regularly buy their smoked bacon, sauces, and vacuum-sealed meats for home. South Whitby location is bare-bones in terms of decor but no one's paying attention to the walls when the food is this good. Need lots of wetnaps after eating the ribs'n'wings combo!"}
{"text":"This is my first negative Yelp review. I avoid posting such reviews as I do not want a business to be negatively affected on my account. This, however, was among the worst food and service I've ever experienced, and thus I feel obligated to do so.   Firstly, the delivery order was missing a full dinner of pulled pork and a side of beans. I called Buster's, they acknowledged they had made the error, and yet refused to supply a partial refund or replacement for the missing items. Instead, they requested I drive in [a few days later, oddly] to request the refund in person -- something I do not have the time or desire to do.   Now, I have a high tolerance for poor service is the food is good. This food was horrendous. The ribs and pulled pork were chalk-dry, lukewarm, bland, and tasted old. The beef brisket was akin to bland, thinly sliced deli meat, and the batter of the fried chicken was indescribably \"off.\" Half of the sides were equally poor.   I've attached a photo of one half-rack of ribs, which was actually less dry than the borderline-inedible counter-part. Notice the burnt, dry appearance.   My one friend, whom I have never seen throw food away -- and we affectionally refer to as \"the dumpster\" when someone cannot finish their food -- threw his remaining dinner away. My other friend, whom never complains about quality of food and is simple to please, threw his remaining dinner away. \"Terrible.\"  Finally, the portion sizes of the brisket and pulled pork were hurtfully small. ~$10 for half a small cup is absurdly high, particularly when the food is old, cold, bland, and awful.   This is among the worst food experience I've ever had, and I encourage you not to go. Whitby has far better options."}
{"text":"2nd visit not as great as the first. I was suppose to get 2 side orders with my ribs but only got one and I sure as hell ain't driving all the way back for baked beans. The second thing that really disappointed me was potato salad. It wasn't what I was picturing in taste. I highly recommend staying away from the potato salad. I found it really salty and ended up throwing it out - (I hate wasting food too). And my final disappointment was the fact that the hush puppies were once again not available. If you are selling food from a menu then you should have enough to supply the demand. If it was late at night then its understandable but this was smack dab in the middle of the day.   Well after all the ranting the food still ended up being really good. I got the Friday special which was $17.99 for a full rack of ribs and 2 sides. However, I really don't consider it much of a special since regular price is $19.99."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. The fries were incredible. Last two visits however have been very underwhelming experiences. The food isn't as good and the decor is in a very sad state.  It seems too me as if they went cost cutting and are buying cheaper ingredients or maybe it's just a different chef. I really don't know but the food is bland now and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food took very long. Servers were very confused and had to ask several questions concerning our meal. The 'BBQ' was served to me from a vacuum sealed bag. They have no idea what they're doing."}
{"text":"I'm going to be a little charitable and round a 3.5 up to 4, though I would recommend the 28 King St location over this more industrial (and more expensive?!) location - it has a smaller menu (no onion rings!) and no beer license.   The pork sandwich was still amazingly good, but at $6.49 ($8 with pop and side), its no bargain to drive out of your way for - and in this area it would be \"out of the way\" for most people.  The nicer location at 28 King Street had the sandwich for $5 last summer, and that was right-priced, and at in a better setting with table service. I wasn't keen on the cashier also preparing the food, which also wasn't an issue at the other location.  One complaint is common to both locations: dude, where's the sauce?!  There is a condiment station with ketchup, vinegar, salt, napkins, forks... But no freaking bbq sauce!  I don't want to decide when I order if I want hot, medium or mild - I want to go to the condiment shelf and help myself.  Since BR makes (and sells) the sauces, this is really confusing and totally unheard of in a BBQ joint. Did they have a bad experience with customers stealing sauce?  If so, accountants call this \"bad debt expense\", so write it off and move on so that people can sample sauce they may like enough to buy a bottle on the way out.   Anyway, for value (it ain't cheap), ambiance (none), and the stingy sauce philosophy, I'd give it 3 stars, but the sandwich was a 4, for an average 3.5. I rounded up because the owner showed some yelp love (10% discount with yelp check-in), posts on chowhound, supports local events/restaurants, and most importantly served up a great sandwich.  I just wish it was $5."}
{"text":"OHHH.... MYYYY .....GOD !!!!!  You have to try their new smoked fried chicken... This should be illegal!  Darryl, you are the devil..LOL... Another Home run for Buster Rhinos!"}

Finally opened in Toronto at Phils  original BBQ location /that's an improvement  Toronto finally has numerous good BBQ  Choices with the stockyards ,Memphis BBQ ( Woodbridge),barques etc"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at Buster Rhinos -- at ANY location.  I go for the brisket.  The brisket is to die for.  The french fries are like Swiss Chalet's fries were before Swiss Chalet sold out.  Remember those?  The sauces are amazing and you can buy them to take home.  If I could nominate the owner for the Order of Canada, I would."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for excellent southern style BBQ at a reasonable price Buster Rhino's is your place. They've opened a lunch counter in the front of their production facility with limited hours (Mon - Tues 10AM - 3PM, Wed - Fri 10AM - 8PM, closed weekends). It's located in an industrial complex at the corner of Thickson Rd and Wentworth St in Whitby. You'd probably never drive past it unless you happened to be in the immediate area.  They serve awesome smoked brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, and baby back ribs (which you can nab fresh from the smoker on Fridays as their special of the day).   Since they serve from the front of their production facility, they usually hold the meat portions individually shrink wrapped and held in a hot water bath. This ensures the meat retains its moisture and the product is very consistent. They also make excellent rubs and BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch. I have ordered many things here. Their poutine is great. I also love the burger-fries combo but it is quiet expensive at $15 if you get it with cheese and bacon."}
{"text":"mmmmm...Pulled Pork Sandwich...mmmmm  Buster Rhino's Pulled Pork give me hope.. that I can enjoy tons of meat and enjoying it! Sorry Vegetarians!  Juicy, Smokey, Tender, Soft and TASTY!! The Spicy BBQ sauce AWESOMELY good... mmmmmm  Wish I were here on a Thursday or Friday to try out their BBQ ribs too! Now Buster Rhino's really worth a drive all the way to Whitby for the authentic Southern BBQ experience!!  BBQ Ribs! BBQ Ribs!! BBQ Ribs!"}
