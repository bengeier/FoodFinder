{"text":"Don't let the basic, sterile decor turn you off. This resto opened in July 2012 and is still finding its footing in terms of ambiance and presentation. Don't judge a book by its cover - this place deserves further attention!

The food is surprisingly tasty! Ingredients are fresh and delicious. I wolfed down a Mexican Falafel Wrap, while my dining companion opted for the Mediterranean Falafel Wrap. The falafel is some of the best I've had in a long time at a casual eatery: perfectly crunchy on the outside, flavourful and fresh on the inside - not at all greasy, dense, or bland as so much falafel can be these days. The wraps were small by current standards, but I far prefer eating a smaller, high-quality wrap than gorging myself on an oversized, tasteless mess of a pita.

The side salads are also quite good, balancing a great mix of fresh ingredients without being drowned in a commercial-type dressing. You can tell everything is made with care and quality in mind.

The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and are keen to make your visit to F&W a good one. The prices are quite decent and reasonable. 

Normally, I would give F&W four stars - but I do think they need to improve the decor of the place to make their resto more inviting and attractive. Give it a try, though!"}
{"text":"Covered in greasy and bloated isn't what I was hoping for when I was short on time and famished, but that's what Restaurant F&W delivered. 

This is fast food plain and simple, though with a slight middle-eastern twist. I had one of their standard lunch sets which included a falafel wrap with a giant side of french fries and a soft drink.  The fries were hot, crispy and really pretty nice, but the falafel wrap was greasy and bland. It's never a good sign when french fries are the star of the meal.

Only half complete with most of the lights switched off, it wasn't an inviting place, I wasn't even certain they were open. If that wasn't bad enough, I felt more like I was in a high school cafeteria than a restaurant.  Their choice of institutional decor was devoid of both character and warmth, making it far too sterile to be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, and delicious food for a good price.  I had a mediterranean falafel wrap and a tabbouleh salad.  The salad was clearly made fresh with good ingredients.  The falafel is fried after you order it, served crunchy on the outside, and deliciously warm.  The wrap seems to be on their own home-made (?) bread, which is also great, and different from the typical chain restaurants in this style.

I can't agree less with a review below about 'greasy and bloated' below - everything was fresh and excellent; maybe because I didn't have the fries.

Yes, the place looks like a regular Lebanese fast food joint from the outside, but they are making stellar food on the inside.  The decor does leave something to be desired, but for the area of town that it's in, you can't always expect good looks."}
