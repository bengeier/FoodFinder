{"text":"Broadway Restaurant is one of the restaurant you would find decent food at a dirt cheap prices!   Here lunch sets started at $3.99 that includes a drink! And the place is clean.. no sticky floors, flithy condiments bottles, greasy tables or funny smell!  I ordered something light since I need to refuel myself in between my yoga classes. Trust me, you don't want to have a full stomach when you trying to do a headstand. I decided on the sandwich/salad/soup/drink combination for $4.99. The soup is quite decent for one of those Chinese version of Russian Borscht soup with tons of vegetables inside. The salad is one of those mayo potatoes salad.. hmmmm not good... the beef and egg sandwich though is a little small but freshly made with BUTTER! (I don't want to know how fattening that is!)   The service here is nice and friendly!  I will be back to try other lunch specials Broadway Restaurant offer for sure!  They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner, I wasn't sure where to go for some good HK cha chan tang style food. Reading the reviews on yelp led me here as my hotel is just around the corner. I went around 12:30 for lunch and there were only 2 customers so the server took my order quite quickly and the food arrived soon after as well. I must commend them for their price. I'm not able to get a bowl of soup, milk tea, AND an entree for $7.50 in Houston. However, they should've mentioned that adding ice to my milk tea would cost me an extra dollar. That's one reason why I couldn't give them an extra star. Still don't understand why a few cubes of ice would cost me an extra dollar.... I ordered the Portuguese chicken and i would say it was alright. There was more sauce and vegetables than there was chicken, but I mean again, it was only $7.50. Service was mediocre and if I lived around the area, I don't think I would visit a second time."}
