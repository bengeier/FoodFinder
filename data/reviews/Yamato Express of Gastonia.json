{"text":"I was starving, about to rip my man's arm off and begin gnawing on it - when we quickly pulled into Yamato Express.  We ordered at a counter, much like any fast food restaurant.  The menu is small but plenty for us to find what we wanted.  We grabbed our cups and headed to the fountain to fill up before finding a booth in the back.  

I can't remember if we had the food delivered or if he picked it up - regardless it was PLENTY of it! And very tasty.  The carrots on the side were way too sweet for my taste, but the rice and steak were very good... especially considering it's fast food Japanese! 

I give it three stars because it isn't as good as a Japanese Steak House - but for what it is, it really deserves four. Ok, I convinced myself, I'm changing it to four because FOR WHAT IT IS - it's very yummy!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed.our meal and the price.  I still prefer Sake express in Belmont, but on the opposite side of 85 Yamato Express is a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place like this since I've moved here and I'm very satisfied! Very good habatchi plates, I am now a regular customer! Keep up the quick service and excellent tasting food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Like I states in my comments the food was average. Service was good. Bathrooms were gross.  Prices are okay. But it's a fast food hibachi place. Nothing exciting nothing new nothing special. Good amount of food for the price but after seeing the bathrooms I won't be coming back.  Unsanitary."}
{"text":"The Gastonia store is one of my favorite local eating places.  Clean store and excellent habachi food."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try-much healthier choice for the area Price range $6.50 to 10.50 depending what you order"}
{"text":"It really is no Sake Express but the food taste just as good. The servings are large like Sake use to be. The place is quiet and clean. I have no comments about the rest rooms since I didn't use it. Overall I give it four stars for the prices and the food was tasty."}
