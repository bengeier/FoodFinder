{"text":"We went in a small group for YYC burger week - their entry was :  Bison Burger seasoned with Basil and stuffed with Bacon. Topped with a Housemade Roasted Tomato Aioli, Gouda Cheese, Arugula, and Fresh Tomatoes. Served on a toasted Kaiser Bun.  The burger was strictly middle of road - no real flavour beyond the bison, serviceable but not a $15 burger. The carrots fries on the side were decent, certainly a good option though they were drenched in a fair bit of oil. The regular house fries on the other hand are simply bad - low quality potato in a thick cut leaving them pretty much without flavour or an appealing texture.   Food aside, service was very slow despite the fact that we showed up early and beat the lunch rush. Food took quite a while to come, opportunities to order anything else were very limited, the wait for the bill (and then the credit machine) was longer than usual.     I had a glass of water with something floating in it (which happens from time to time) I asked for a new one prior to receiving my food and did not get a new glass until after I had finished eating.   With mediocre food and  a low level of service there are a lot of better places at and below this price point. Reading other reviews perhaps they were off their stride, but I doubt I'd bother giving it a second shot. It's telling that nearly everyone in the place was there because of the burger week promotion."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat at Canvas but the coffee is amazing, and according to the friends I went in with, the food is pretty delicious too. It's a time space that is bright and the service is great. Can't wait to try their outdoor patio when it's nice out. Probably has some good people watching opportunities later in the evening, as its right across from Broken City, And Amsterdam Rhino. This spot is great for a coffee by yourself while your working on your computer or an intimate date night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here when he found out the reviews to this place and we were not disappointed. Service was excellent and the food was even better. We will be coming back for dessert since we were too full to try."}
{"text":"If your downtown Calgary and you haven't tried the food/drinks at Canvas I highly recommend it.  The braised short ribs are the best I have ever had.  Nice sunny patio as well.  The service was just fantastic and they have an outdoor fireplace and heater for the chilly nights.  Live music sometimes!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Canvas a few times now and had some ok experiences. I love the space, the patio is so nice and inside is very quaint.   The drink list is appealing and we had decent service each time.... that being said both times we had food here it was very unimpressive. I heard there is a new menu that launched so maybe that would change things.  What do I mean about unimpressive? One: The charcuterie we ordered had ugly chunks of honey ham and the board in general was boring and lack anything creative....  Second: I ordered a veggie eggs benedict without the hollandaise sauce... it came swimming in it.   When I am paying for something and I ask for it to be a certain way that doesn't take any effort (like just not adding dressing/sauces) please, just don't add them on. It's so disappointing and ruins the experience and my meal.  There is apparently a cute little gallery in the basement that I really want to go check out...Maybe then I can take that opportunity to try the new menu.... I hope it's as good as it could be."}
{"text":"I decided to have my birthday at Canvas with my family after I had experienced the warmth and exuberance of Maria, the manager/owner? of this quaint little lounge/bistro across from Broken City. It's like she's been awaiting your arrival and is just thrilled that you could make it! When you first walk in, you'll notice some contemporary decor (i.e., steel bison head mounted behind the bar) and lovely hanging light pom pom's on the patio (which has a fireplace that I will be trying out over the summer I'm sure) that give a romantic glow to the entire (teeny tiny) bistro. Our server was a very sweet and earnest girl who probably didn't have a lot of experience so I don't blame her for her somewhat unconfident approach to serving. For example, when we asked why a large prominent chalkboard sign stating \"Most wines 40% off\" didn't coincide with reality (only 1 red and 1 white were 40% off...hardly \"most\"), she dismissed us with \"well I don't make the decisions here\" instead of playing up the 2 wines on sale or asking us which wine we were interested in etc...Otherwise, she was attentive and apologetic when the mussels were not available and the dinner was served a bit later than what we expected (we sat down at 7 and received our food at 830). Speaking of the food, oh my goodness, sooo delicious!! For appetizers, we ordered the pork belly and braised short ribs. They were beautifully presented and tasted great. For the main course I had the burger with a side salad  (extra topping of applewood cheddar and onions) and loved the seasoning and quality of vegetables in the salad. My family loved their meals too and definitely changed their tune about the wait after the first bite (from mildly annoyed to super happy!). For dessert (offered by the chef because it was my bday), we were presented with an saskatoon berry icecream and brandied pears. The icecream was divine and signalled the end of our 2 hour dinner that started off shaky but was saved by Maria's charisma and the chef's talent. I would definitely come back for drinks and appies but big parties may not be patient enough!"}
{"text":"The downstairs bar doubles as an art gallery for private and public events - it is simply stunning and features work by local and national artists.   I've been here 3 times and the service is always exceptional. Good wine list and a great place to bring a date or impress a client."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to our office. I have been here quite a few times. Guru, the chef creates fantastic meals. I'm always impressed. The wait staff is excellent as well. On a warm day the patio is fantastic - southern exposure."}
