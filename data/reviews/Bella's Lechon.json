{"text":"my friend ordered Bella's lechon for his daughter's bday. it was a big disappointment, hit and miss kind of thing. i wasnt around the time my friend ordered one so i havent mention him about my(-) experience with Bella's lechon. i could have sent him to one of the chinese bbq specialty restaurant. they ordered it and have it cut with extra charge....its better to order the whole lechon and not have it cut bec. you can see by the looks of the lechon if it is cook or not. the taste of the lechon is so \"piggy\"(me amoy)....in short, not recommended."}
{"text":"Owners were friendly! Lechon was definitely pinoy style which is awesome! Food was great as well comparable to homemade cooking! If you are lazy to cook dinner, this is definitely your first destination :)"}
{"text":"We ordered an 80lb Lechon not cut but the day we picked it up the lechon felt like it was 30lbs. When we arrived at our party we cut the Lechon and realized that  there was barely any meat in the belly section of the Lechon which caused it to cave in. We were told at check out that even though it felt lighter it was because of the organs they took out. That was definitely not the only thing that was missing because all the meat was gone! I would definitely not recommend Bella's Lechon to anyone. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. Sometimes their lechon is amazing, especially if they gave you a part of the pig that has less fat and less gristly. Sometimes it's way too 'malansa'... and still taste a bit underdone..... would love to give a better review but like I said, it is kind of hit and miss for you to get good quality from this place.  One thing I love about this place is that they make their own LECHON SAUCE. As in, you can taste the liver in it... you know that they make it themselves."}
{"text":"I alwaus do take out or order ahead of time. One of the best sisigs around. It's not chewy and a perfect puritan with drinks and perhaps sisig fries ."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this place on the basis of food quality, location, and service. FOOD QUALITY- nothing special about their food.We tried a couple of dishes - adobo, lechon paksiw and sisig and were underwhelmed. Granted that all of these dishes are pork-based, I still found the food to be very greasy and not very fresh. LOCATION - the plaza itself is located along Morningside Avenue, just north of the 401. Several bus routes originating from Kennedy Stn, Scarborough Town Centre and points further west serve this location so it is fairly easy to get to. However, drivers might find parking a bit of a challenge because the plaza is occupied by numerous small businesses which tend to be busy. SERVICE - the person we dealt with wasn't particularly pleasant nor welcoming. We were planning to order a lechon and had a few questions for her. She seemed really put out and unwilling to answer our questions even though we were the only customers at the time. We decided to take our business elsewhere, since they didn't seem to want it. If you are looking for good lechon, you would be better off going to HoHo Chinese BBQ located at the southeast corner of Midland and McNicoll. The owners are super nice, the lechon is excellent quality and is actually less expensive than Bella's."}
{"text":"Avoid this Filipino restaurant. I ordered sizzling sisig that was served cold and not freshly cooked. The food ruined my stomach. The menu must have been on the tray for hours and the heating system was below the right sustaining temperature. Thus, if you don't want to ruin your stomach...avoid this fastfood store...they serve crappy food!!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little take out joint when we were out aimlessly looking for something \"interesting\" to have for a weekend dinner.  I admit, we've never had Filipino food before so I'll start my review with that preface.  The store was crammed with bakery equipment and 4 small tables and an older lady stood behind a hot table full of wonderfully aromatic prepared dishes.  We had no idea what we were looking at and the lady behind the hot table offered us samples of some of the foods we were eyeing.  We decided on a 2 item combo and a 3 item combo so we could try out a variety of things.  I couldn't tell you what half the dishes we tried are called (refer to photos) but one thing that really stuck out was a dish called \"Sisiq.\"  It was wonderfully crunchy and savoury mix of roasted pork skin mixed with small amount of chopped vegetables in a well balanced savoury sauce.  There was also a seafood dish of baby squid steamed and stir fried in savoury (almost squid ink like in flavour) sauce which was excellent.  It seemed like the baby squid were steamed whole before being stir-fried which almost made the squids taste like they were stuffed.  I could go on trying to describe everything we tried but it would simply take too long.  I suggest you try this little take-out joint for yourself and I hope you won't be disappointed.  We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other yelper:  Lechon is a hit and miss.  I had it today for lunch (Lechon platter) and it had the \"malansa\" taste.  Also ordered the tocilog.  It looked and tasted not fresh.  It did not have the tocino taste at all.   The garlic fried rice needs more garlic oil.  It is too bad that the food I had today sucked.  The service was attentive though."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the last few years -- the lechon is what to go for, and it always helps to chat with the folks at the counter.  Amazing roast pig -- succulent and moist with perfect crackling crisp skin.  It comes with a great garlic sauce as well.  I have found the other items hit and miss, but here's why it helps to talk with the staff and ask about the items that are unfamiliar.  Blood stew, dinuguan, is worth trying at least once, and the lightly pickled fish, kinilaw, is great, though not always on the menu.  There is only a small simple eating area, so I've always taken the food out."}
{"text":"I came around 1130 A.M for some early lunch on a weekday. For someone who is sensitive to salt, sugar, and oil in Filipino foods, I thought the boodle platter B was passable without feeling bloated or heavy from the get go. I've heard that the lechon was hit or miss, but the chicken, lechon, fish, pinakbet, mango salad, and salted egg combo was not too salty or too oily. The lechon was crispy and cooked well enough to not have the fishy or raw taste. It's a platter where each person can get 3 or more servings of rice. There were four of us that came and we still had so much leftover rice to bring home. The sago gulaman was too sweet for my taste but that can be easily fixed by diluting it with water. The soup that comes with an order reminded me of soup stock with extra scallions. If ever take-out is all you need, they're siopao was good, it comes with egg inside and the texture of the pulled pork mended ok with the bread. Price wise for the boodle B, which came around 60$, is good even with 4-6 people sharing the price and the food. You'll definitely be full."}
{"text":"We ordered sisig and they told us it would be ready at 12:30. It was let ready till almost 2 pm and we needed it for a birthday party. The lady at cash didn't even care or apologize and was rude. I'll never go back there"}
