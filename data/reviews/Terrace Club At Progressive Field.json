{"text":"Came up here in a whim during the game,  pretty windy out there tonight so we thought what the heck.  They took walk-ins and we got a good view of the field. We got some beers had the pretzels with mustard, very good. Then we got the Grilled chicken wings with tequila lime marinated. They were the best chicken wings I've ever had! The staff was attentive but not over bearing. Very friendly and management came around and checked on us. Love the place will be back!"}
{"text":"I gave the Terrace Club a second chance and this time made reservations right up next to the glass.  I thought it'd be the ideal view, but what's a view without the excitement?  Like other reviewers have mention, there is a big disconnect and you don't feel like you are even at the game.  We spent most of our time scoping out which seats were untaken below us. As for the food, thumbs down.  Extremely overpriced.  $37 for the buffet hardly seems worth it.  The menu only features a handful of entrees.  One of my diners did not even order because of the lack of variety.  I ordered a burger that was so thick, I couldn't even eat it properly and therefore did not enjoy.  Another diner ordered pasta and meatballs which turned out to be two huge meatballs with just a few spoonfuls of pasta.  the bread was less than to be desired as well.  I was tempted to ask the waitress to get a hot dog for me from one of the venders."}
{"text":"Julie  Went to the ballgame while in Clev.. and just looking for a place to sit down and dine.  The only spot at the Indians game in Progressive Field was the Terrace Club which is a restaurant that overlooks the stadium from left field.  Reservations were easy to get as the stadium was quite empty.  The thing to do is get the cheapest stub hub tickets which go as low as $2 bucks since the stadium does not sell out.  Get into the ball park and head to the restaurant.  When you're done just go sit at any available seat in the house...    We got $15 seats that was on the first base side and nearly in the front row...  Seats that would usually cost at least 10x that at Citifield or Yankee stadium.    The meal was a buffet for $27...   What a bargain compared to what I would pay in NYC...     The food was: Teriyaki beef skewers...  excellent Duck in spring rolls...  good I skipped the roasted turkey.. Short Ribs was very good... Sides of sweet potato and asparagus were top notch. and Cesar's salad and other misc starters were nice accompaniments to the meal.  Excellent value with a gorgeous view of a beautiful stadium.  Go Indians....."}
{"text":"Eating at the Terrace Club was a shame because the venue is so awesome.  The food is pretty below average though.  The menu is extremely small and I ended up ordering the chicken sandwich.  Turns out the food is identical to the fare in the ballpark at any food stand.  I wanted to take my boyfriend for his birthday because he's always wanted to go and I still think the restaurant is a neat experience, but the food shouldn't be the same as what you get at the food stands."}
{"text":"Avoid this place unless there is bad weather!  This place went from decent to horrible... Nacho chips had the exact same sauce and toppings as the pulled pork Taco Trio. No salsa just some bizarre white queso. The Indians made a huge mistake switching whichever company prepare their food from last year. What happened to the awesome cheese platter? Is it too late to get a refund? I should have said yes oh, when the waitress offered. But the drinks were okay."}
{"text":"I've grown up in and lived in Cleveland my entire life and ALWAYS being an avid Tribe fan, but I can count on one hand the amount of times I've eaten at the Terrace Club.    Not that I didn't want to go, but if you're going to watch the baseball game, why not truly immerse yourself in the entire experience? Sit down in the bleachers, order a hot dog, some beers and scream your head off like every true Clevelander should! I mean, aren't we the best fans in the world? I THINK SO!  With that said, the only times I've ever eaten at the Terrace Club at Progressive Field have been for events when there was no game going on.  To be honest, I recommend doing it this way if you can. Here's why:  It's a beautiful venue with huge, sprawling windows facing the baseball field. Now, this may seem perfect for game-watching, but it's not really. You're very disconnected for the game and it's mostly a view of the outfield. They have plenty of TV's to watch, but then why not just watch it at home?   The space can also get a little tricky with where you're seated too. They seem to have plenty of tables facing the windows, but there is also an upper section that you could get stuck in, with no view of the field at all.  I've never had a bad experience with the food. That says a lot since I mentioned before I've only been there for special events, which included a preselected menu.  Although, I've seen the menu before and I would say the best deal is the buffet, which is about $25-$30/ person (I believe). If you order separately from the menu, you're looking at double digit prices for almost all food items.  Honestly, the food is good, but for that price...I'd rather go to a nicer restaurant. That's just my opinion.   My latest experience at the Terrace Club was just this afternoon for a local charity's awareness event, called City Mission. They had a preselected lunch menu, several speakers and a video.   I think the venue was beautiful for the event, but I wouldn't recommend it for a speaking engagement. It was hard to see the podium and at times, the speakers had their backs to some of the audience.  The shape of the venue just doesn't lend itself for this kind of event.   The food was good. They served turkey sandwiches on croissants and pasta salad in a bed of lettuce.  It all seemed fresh and was tasty, although it was nothing to write home about.   All in all, I'd say the event was a success, but more because of the cause and the content.  The venue is great for events but not for a speaking engagement and, in my opinion, not for a game either."}
{"text":"So what it's over priced?  The staff is always helpful and attentive. The view is great plus it's a great place to stay warm and dry earlier in the season when Cleveland weather is punching you in the face. Over the 2013 season...I went to the Indians clam bake. $65 all you can eat and it was well worth it. Bags of clams, fresh cracked entire lobsters, Old Bay peel and eat shrimp....anything u can think of at a clam bake and more.  Drinks are expensive but what isn't expensive at any MLB park?"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time in over ten years.  Gone are the days when you needed to make reservations far in advance and had to leave before the game started if you came for batting practice.  The restaurant was not full.  You have a choice of entrees or buffet.  The buffet changes daily.  The base buffet is a salad bar and a gourmet hot dog wagon.  The salads were good and the anitpasto selections were excellent.  The hot dogs were excellent as well.  For extra, you can get hot entrees.  They were hit and miss.  Some were excellent, some, not so much.  They sounded better than they looked, but tasted good.  Desserts are ordered a la carte.  The pretzel dessert is unique and amazing.  Think a cinnamon pretzel with caramel ice cream.  They also have a baseball sundae, which is a white chocolate baseball surrounding vanilla and chocolate ice cream.  Service was a bit slow.  You obviously get a great view of the ballpark.  Overall, a nice occasional option to eat before or during a game, especially if the weather is not so good."}
{"text":"This was a great option to standard baseball Park food. I was happy that I could get a table without a reservation during a weekday day game. I was seated immediately with a great view of the field and tv. You can't hear the park announcer but you can follow activities from TV commentary.  I ordered the Thai Cobb Salad for $11.50 and a Pepsi for $3. Very reasonably priced for the venue. My salad was great!  I was offered refills and the opportunity to continue to watch the game after finishing my salad.  I hope that I can eat here again!  I enjoyed the experience and my lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent patron at the Terrace Club.  It's a great venue to watch games.  But it has been so inconsistent, you never know what you'll experience from one visit to the next.  Most recently, the wait time was worse than I've ever seen.  And the food quality and quantity were highly questionable.   Basically, ever since Shelby was promoted to another area at Progressive Field about a year ago, the experience at Terrace Club has not been the same.  She cared about the patrons' experience.  The new guy doesn't appear to.  There's a leadership problem at Terrace Club.  Until that gets fixed, patrons' experiences will be all over the place."}
