{"text":"Excellent and cozy place to chill on some sushi and wash it down with a Sapporo. I'll go back soon. Staff is nice too. No rush no fuss."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in Markham...hands down.  My wife and I have travelled to Japan, but you cannot compare Japan sushi to \"York Region\" sushi as described in another review.  The husband and wife owners are very sweet and welcoming people.  The tempura for the sushi is always made to order and you can taste the warmth of the shrimp tempura in the rolls.  The nori in the rolls is always fresh, never chewy and the rolls are consistently of the same quality, excellent.  If you want AYCE sushi, then go elsewhere, but if you are looking for quality and a nice quiet environment, then eat here."}
{"text":"Markham sushi has me on the fence. To start off this place is hidden in a plaza (right beside the TD Bank) so you really need to look for it, even the sign at the front is very small.   However once you find it and go inside the place is small and the decor is very nice, they even have private booths which I found pleasant.  My friend and I both ordered a maki lunch set, and we also got a spicy salmon roll. The food tasted delicious!! However, it was not filling and we agreed that their sushi is smaller than other Sushi joints we have been at, and you don't even get a lot for the price. (Compare to Matsuda's lunch specials for example).  On their site they claim that their food is \"filling and fresh\". The fresh part is correct, their food tastes delicious but it is not filling. The other thing that we didn't like about Markham Sushi was that they charge you if you want green tea (which is something that is usually offered by most sushi establishments for free). The place was very clean, the waitress was nice but she didn't check up on us as much.  VERDICT: I would recommend this place if you do not want a lot of food, but you want to eat GREAT tasting sushi. However if you want a lot of food for the price then this is not the place for you!!!! My friend and I left feeling satisfied with the taste but our hunger was not satisfied."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat sushi! You can order in or take out which is nice. The wife and husband who own the place have always been very welcoming and I always find the wait times for food are appropriate!  I very rarely want to go else where! They have 3 booths that you can section yourself off to have more privacy which I find very nice! You must check it!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is decent. We've been here about 4 times. Today however we were left waiting by the door and nobody greeted us or sat us down in the 3 minutes we were there. There was another young family with two kids waiting ahead of us. What was irritating was the middle aged worker there clearly saw us but was casually cleaning up a table left by customers who were already gone, rather than attending to customers who were there waiting. The place was not that busy."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is slow but it's a small family place and everyone loves it, so you will probably wait. Food is great and it is cozy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to grab some take out before an appointment in the area.  It's a hidden away restaurant in a strip plaza and if I hadn't seen the sign in front i wouldn't have realized it was there.  A fish and chips place is right out front and we were considering going there but decided sushi was a healthier option.  It was 5:30 on a Monday and the restaurant was completely empty.  We ordered 6 rolls and our bill came to just over $30.  There is a 10% discount if you pay cash :). We were told 20 minutes before our rolls would be ready which was a problem as we had to go.  They managed to get everything done in 10 minutes.   The rolls were good, but small.  It felt like we ordered the mini version of the regular rolls.  There wasn't anything special about these rolls, and I don't know if I would recommend or go back.  Staff were pleasant and food was quick."}
{"text":"Always fresh and the sushi is so good - the diablo roll is my favourite. The service can be a little slow at times but the sushi makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This place is about two minutes by foot from my house, so naturally I've had dinner here on many a night. The atmosphere is really nice for a little strip mall, and the owners are a very nice Korean couple by the names of Paul and Grace.  What you need to know is basically this: their salad dressing is very very good and probably made in-house, service is average, the place is always impeccably clean and ingredients are insanely fresh. The sushi rolls are nice and thick, the rice is cooked perfectly, and the fish doesn't have a hint of unpleasant taste. Tempura is more vegetable than batter, noodles are generous, teriyaki sauce is delicious. Their bulgogi is also great.  You can have pop, beer or sake to drink and ice cream for dessert.  I recommend their vegetable rice if you like something sweet, katsu udon if you would like something a bit heavier, and their sushi for any reason whatsoever."}
{"text":"This is our local sushi place and although we have tried many others in the Markham area we always end up coming back here and are recognized and welcomed. Family owned and operated, Markham Sushi offers fresh, tasty sushi and sashimi in addition to chicken, beef or shrimp teriyaki and other dishes. Dinners come with miso soup and salad with delicious ginger dressing, or you can change it up with seaweed salad instead. Takeout is usually ready with 15-20 minutes.  Prices are reasonable and competitive with similar places in the area.  One caveat: their takeout business is as busy as the eat-in side and sometimes service is slower to accommodate large orders, a usual 15 minute order could sometimes end up taking 45 minutes."}
{"text":"First time, went in for lunch today and found that there was quite a selection on the menu. I had one of the Maki specials (12 rolls) which included spicy salmon and yam rolls and a miso soup. I also tried the unagi maki (6 rolls). Taste was really authentic (I'm no expert) and decently priced. The servings seemed a bit small and that's why I ended up with 18 rolls. I may try the Bento box specials on another day as that looks to be the best value."}
{"text":"Waitress rushed my order and they ran out of noodles that come with the bento lunch.  Server never checked up on us and the galbi was all fat 20% meat.   Salad was good. Disappointed"}
{"text":"A relatively simple menu of fresh Japanese staples and also some Korean favourites too.  I came here around 7pm on a Wednesday.  The space is small but bustling.  Many tables were either taken or in need of cleaning (they seem to not clean tables unless someone is in need of a seat).  The sushi and sashimi are incredibly fresh.  The rolls are wrapped so delicately with the thinnest layer of rice.    I had the sashimi platter for 2 which had a variety of fish including ika, octopus, salmon, scallop, talapia, surf clam and butter fish.  The soy sauce is lightly salty which compliments the fish perfectly.  Would go again if in the area.  The staff is quite friendly and the food is good, not expensive or cheap but appropriately priced for the quality and variety of fish they offer."}
{"text":"Another average sushi place but the food is fresh. Appears to be family run. Decent sushi with relatively cheap prices. Hard to find as its in a little strip mall near the TD bank.  Been here twice - once for take-out and another time for dine-in. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here once, I wanted sushi last night and thought I'll make another visit, their sushi is fresh and it was close to home so my friends and I (4) decided to drive there. Once we got there, the waitress came out and told us the food would take an hour to arrive and asked if that was OK. She mentioned they just received a large order of sushi order and won't be able to make more sushi until an hour later. It was roughly 8pm at this point and yes we are hungry and no that's not OK.... So we left and headed to another sushi place.   My advice? Maybe hire another sushi chef......."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out and ate in once. service is fast and everything tastes awesome! wish the portions were bigger but its yum!"}
{"text":"Loved the sushi, fish was very fresh! Ordered sushi and sashimi dinner combo for $14.99 which came with soup and salad, only problem was that it was a bit pricey for not enough food...but maybe I just eat a lot haha"}
{"text":"Gonna try to be as fair & as level-headed as possible while writing this review (considering I'm pretty annoyed).  Friends and I made a reservation for ~14 people.  We were told to get there on time because they won't hold our table.  Cool!  We get there at 6pm - the time of our reservation.  My husband and I were the first to place our orders at around 6:20.  We ordered the nigiri bento, black dragon rolls and spicy salmon avocado roll.  One by one our friends sporadically started getting their food.  First gyozas came, then a bowl of udon soup, then a large platter of sushi and rolls, tempura, another order of rolls, then we waited for the 3 last meals... and waited.  We asked about our order and was assured that it was coming.  Continued to wait.  At this point, we've seen people arrive at the restaurant after us, finish eating and leave.  At 7:15, our baby was fussing, so we decided to ask them to change our order to take out.  The server was nice overall, but offered her explanation as to why the food was coming out slowly: \"we're a mom and pop shop.  We're not used to having a full house\".  Well congratulations on the full house, but if you can't handle it, then maybe don't have so many tables??  And why tell us you can't hold our table if you're not expecting a lot of people?  At 7:32, we finally got our order.  We get home starving. We tear the boxes open... and there's no soy sauce!   Food: Pricey for what you get, presentation of rolls and nigiri sushi was nice, but nigiri portion was modest.  Spicy salmon was pretty tasteless. Ginger and wasabi get a thumbs up.  Soy sauce: missing.  In conclusion, I was left hungry and annoyed.  Definitely drive a little west on Hwy 7 and eat at Osaka Sushi instead, a mom & pop shop that won't leave you waiting over an hour for your food."}
{"text":"Under new management and it made a huge difference. The location is very convenient so as a sushi enthusiast I tried it immediately upon moving to the area. Service was good but not fresh and poorly prepared so I hadn't returned until I saw the \"New management\" sign.  Just back after my second visit to the new spot and I am extremely pleased. The sushi is fresh, the chef obviously has skill and I see an attention to quality.  If you think you've been to Markham sushi you really haven't unless you've been there in the last few weeks. I will be there at least once a week now. I may still make the occasional trip to Tomo in Richmond Hill but I am ecstatic to have a spot to get decent sushi without hopping on the highway."}
{"text":"SUPER HIDDEN SUSHI PLACE IN ALL OF MARKHAM!!! Having lived in this area for a few years now, and not knowing that there is actually a decent sushi place around here is quite embarrassing. Markham Sushi is hidden because it's in a little hole of the plaza, right beside Fish and Chips and TD Canada Trust.  I decided to stop here for lunch with my friend to realize that they had very tasty lunch specials. I would say that their lunch menu is much more worth it than their dinner menu as they consist of a similar number of items if not more for lunch for a much better price.  This is truly a local sushi spot and it is not opened by Westerners. Many local people in the neighbourhood stop by for sushi. It has a great privacy with private booths for everyone. The lunch specials are $13.99 for a bento box. The bento box comes with miso soup, salad, rice and japchae. In addition, you could pick two items for your bento box. One of my favourites includes choosing a six piece roll and some sashimi.   They have a dinner bento box, for $17.99. It's essentially the same thing, except if comes with an additional 2pcs spring rolls & 6pcs california roll instead of the rice and japchae.  For dinner when I come as a group, we get the dinner combos. For a sashimi, sushi and roll combo for three people, they offer 52pcs for $51.99. This includes: 20 sashimi, 20 sushi,6 california roll, 6 salmon roll. It's fairly pricey if you think about it - essentially it's $1 per item, but it's also a lot of food if you think about it. The quality of Markham sushi is decent - I'd say in one of my top 5 in Markham, and it's close to me, which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times over the last five years.  The first time we went a table behind us found a worm in their edamame and were offered a $5 discount.  This deterred us from wanting to go back but eventually we did and had been enjoying it until our last experience.  I ordered on the phone take out, and in the middle of the conversation was interrupted by the mother of the person on the phone who accused me of having placed an order the night before.    Not having listened to my gut I still ordered and picked up.  It was clear that they didn't believe me because when I went 30 mins later to pick up my order (they said 25) they hadn't started it.  I waited another 15 mins and there was no apology.  They clearly do not know how to deal with customers and have no appreciation for their customers."}
{"text":"My first time going to Markham Sushi. It's hiden in a little plaza. It's a nice cozy local restaurant. Food is reasonably priced. Food quality is what you pay for. It was good,  but could be better, but again, the price is not expensive so I'm happy with the quality. I had the bento lunch combo, salmon teriyaki and spicy dynamite roll $14.99. My hubby had sushi lunch $11.99."}
{"text":"I needed to an update to my review based on my most recent experience at Markham Sushi for dinner. Earlier this year, they renovated their location a bit. They remained open and food was still good ie: portions for the $$. Last night we ordered take out. There were a few problems with our order.  #1 Our bill was $15 more than what we paid 2 months ago for the exact same items. #2 They changed the recipes on a couple of items - None of which was communicated or added to their menus. Had i known, it would've left me with the choice of whether to order those specific items or not. #3 The chicken terriyaki portion looked bigger. Only because they had decided to slice the pieces even thinner and heap them in. It was so thin, i couldn't even tell that i was eating chicken. #4 They changed the dipping sauce for their Gyoza dumplings. Again not written anywhere on the menu or even communicated to me when i was ordering.  Their food still tastes good, but i'm not impressed with the huge price hike because they decided to renovate a few things in their restaurant. Also it would've been nice to hear that a couple of items on the menu had changed in portion, price & taste. That's a simple courtesy that could be given when someone is placing an order. I get that restaurants renovate and need to recoup costs somehow, but that kind of price hike leaves me questioning if i will continue to be a regular or not anymore. If i'm paying $65-$70 for dinner for 2, i can just as easily go to the Westin Prince Or Delta Rooftop restaurant and get a 5 star meal."}
{"text":"Only ordered take-out here. When picking up, the restaurant seems very small. The folks working there are Korean and seem very pleasant. However, the food is no Osaka (further west on Highway7). We tried this place because Osaka was closed on a Monday."}
{"text":"This placed is tucked inside a plaza that I wouldn't even visit if my friend didn't even tell me there was a sushi place.  Went to try this place tonight...sighs..why is Japanese food in york region so disappointing...I mean it's not the cheapest fast eats like a food court....Japanese food is not suppose to be like this...considering the fact this place looks like it was owned by either Koreans or Japanese...more to Korean side I believe. I would have expected more versus a Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese peepz.  Anyways, we ordered the Sashimi platter and once again, I am disappointed...why do they cut the fish so thick? why? I don't mind places giving me less and charging me more if the quality is there...the sashimi was so thick it looked like beef tenderloin thickness...I miss Japan badly!  service...close to none..the place wasn't packed...but I guess due to the limited staff (seems like only the family works there) we got close to no service. But I was gracious enough to even give them 12% for no service....  disappointed..should I just stop eating Japanese food in Toronto? Save my $ and go back to Japan for another visit...  Please God, give me a decent Japanese place..."}
{"text":"Go if you want fresh sushi I'd recommend this place for couples. Polite servers and great service Most of all, proper food."}
{"text":"This is our close to home \"go-to\" sushi restaurant after we had to disengage from our previous neighbourhood \"go-to\" of Daisuki which nosedived and that's another review.  Service is always good for us.  We're seated quickly and food comes with little wait.  Agreed with previous reviewers that the food does not have a big WOW factor but it's perfectly good, tasty and consistent,"}
{"text":"A very small place hidden inside a little plaza I believe this is a husband and wife run operation and no other workers so if it were to get busy then service could be slow. I found service to be very efficient though.   Ordered a sushi combo for $15.99 Fish was fresh and tasty salmon was sliced in very long lengths but very thin as well  Meal comes with miso soup  Nothing will blow you out of the water here but its a good place for a quick Japanese food fix."}
{"text":"Not a bad sushi place by any means (I mean, the fish was fresh), but with several sushi restaurants nearby I wouldn't mind shelling off a few more bucks to get better variety.  I ordered take-out from here last night and had the sushi dinner, which came with a miso soup and salad. The miso soup was quite salty, with quite a heavy punch of MSG compared to other restaurants. The salad is quite good though, and the sauce was put separate (at least for take out), so you can add as much (or as little) as you want.  The sushi itself I found to be quite fresh and I overall enjoyed it, however it definitely lost marks for fish variety. Out of the 12 pieces of sushi, 5 of them were salmon. I understand salmon is the staple of sushi and sashimi, but 5 pieces are quite overkill. There was only one piece of tuna, butterfish, albacore tuna, surf clam, to name a few. I would've definitely liked it more if more variety was possible, however they charge extras if you want to switch up the fish choices.  For $14.99, it's a good restaurant if you're into the \"lay it down, basic a la carte\" style of sushi. If you want more exotic and variety of sashimi grade fish, however, I suggest Toro Sushi over this.  PS: They need to turn down the heat of this restaurant. Sure it was quite cool yesterday, but it felt like I entered to a sauna when ordering."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a craving for non-all-u-can-eat sushi, so we decided to give this place a chance as the reviews on here seemed ok.  Back in the 80s and 90s, this place was a mom and pop burger place (Polly's Kitchen).  Love the fact they kept the original wood siding!  Never judge a book by its cover....sure the interior isn't the greatest, but hey...isn't it about the food?  We ordered some dragon rolls, red dragon rolls and a stir fry.  Very fresh ingredients used and probably had the best dragon rolls I have ever eaten.  Will definitely go back!  The avocado tasted like butter!  Cannot wait to go back!  They have been in business since 2000....a lot of people from the immediate neighbourhood mostly.  Take out is popular too.  Do yourself a favour and stop going to the ayce places and spend some $ on good quality a la carte sushi from Markham Sushi :)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Markham. I've been visiting it for approximately four or five years now. The couple who owns it are very nice and sweet. The food is always delicious and the atmosphere is nice and calming. I usually order the beef udon and a few rolls, usually the green dragon roll and a spider roll.  The beef udon is wonderful in the winter. The broth is rich and beefy and each sip just fills you up with a sense if well-being. The noodles and nice and chewy, I love the texture. Theres a nice amount of beef and the vegtables are nive abd fresh.  The rolls, you really can't go wrong with them. Chef Paul always does a wonderful job with them. They take pride in making sure they present the customer with the freshest and moat delicious food possible.   The service here is always lovely. They greet you nicely and always make sure you have tea."}
{"text":"When we want sushi for dinner this is our go to place.  It's always fresh and they have a great variety. I wouldn't say I am a sushi expert, mostly we stick with the veggie options. The wife loves the yam rolls. I like it all! This place looks family run and you usually get great quality when it's family run. It's a tad pricey compared to others but for us it's worth it due to the freshness."}
{"text":"The service here is always good. Small place run by a family. It is quite hidden inside the plaza with not much signage. The inside is decorated quite nicely with a very Japanese feel.   They have good lunch specials here. Prices are also worth it. The food is always really good. I only order vegetarian stuff so I'm not sure how the other food is here. I did try the teriyaki chicken once and thought it tasted really good. I love their salad dressing as well.   I come here often as it's the only decent food around."}
{"text":"Yelp is right again, a solid 3.5 stars, but lets round up because customer service was superb! We ordered the takoyaki and edamame special for $8.50 and also a sushi rolls platter. Overall, the sushi was pretty good, they even add a bit of mayo into the tempura shrimp roll giving it more taste than other Japanese restaurants. This restaurant offers bento boxes and a build your own bento for $20. So you are definitely looking at OSAKA prices (the restaurant down the street). For the pieces of fish we ordered, they were generally fresh, BUT they serve the sushi with soya sauce that is NOT Japanese. The saltiness of their soya sauce made their sushi less tasteful and VERY salty. I could see myself coming back, but bringing my own soya sauce. I hope they see this review and consider swapping their sauces out to Japanese sushi soya sauce. It really does make a difference, especially if I am going to pay over $20 per person. I expect the real stuff!"}
{"text":"I found myself in Markham for the first time late one scorching afternoon and consulted my GPS to satiate my hunger pangs. Markham Sushi is what resulted when I typed in \"Markham\" and \"sushi\". Fair enough, I thought and ventured to try it.  Late afternoon is something of a limbo for restaurants, so I wasn't too worried that the restaurant was empty when I arrived. The friendly man behind the sushi bar and the woman who greeted me with a warm welcome appeared to be a Korean couple. The decor in the small strip mall restaurant was more authentic and pleasantly ornate than I had expected.   I quickly decided on the sushi and sashimi dinner special from the thick menu complete with colour photos. The appetizer salad and miso soup that quickly arrived were nicer and more delicious than average. I especially appreciated the abundance of extra rich and creamy dressing on the salad. My dinner was good and the peace and quiet of the place really enjoyable."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been frequenting Markham Sushi (also known as Mei Mon Markham Sushi) now for a little over a year and it never disappoints. That said, here's our take on this lovely little establishment:   Location: Tucked back in a plaza off Highway 7, its a place that can be easy to miss if you're not looking for the main plaza sign listing. Once you find it, it almost takes on a feel of being your own hidden hideaway, and reminiscent of that 'izakaya' feel I experienced while living in Osaka myself. Though it can be tricky to spot without a keen eye, you'll feel like you've stumbled across a secret place.   Atmosphere: Dim lighting, private seating and cultural decor set in an intimate space all contribute to a very comfortable, relaxed, atmospheric experience that feels like a great 'date' place or an after work dinner and drinks spot. Positive vibe all around.  Service: Friendly, courteous service, whether dining in or taking out. It's a family run place, who you can see make it their business to ensure their customers are taken care of. One such experience comes to mind once when we picked up an incorrect takeout order. Upon arriving home and finding out, the staff were very apologetic and were very willing to drive out the correct order to us (even though we were out of the delivery range), or heavily discount our meal. Its service like this that ensures customers know the staff are concerned with maintaining repeat visits.   Food: Fantastic Japanese fare, the best we've had in the Markham area bar none. From their chicken teriyaki and tempura dishes, to their sushi rolls and bulgogi, their bento sets are fantastic. Portion sizes are more than generous, and the menu expansive, so be prepared to allow yourself some time to go through it. Can't say enough about how much we enjoy the food there, we actually drive 15+ minutes to this place despite having two Japanese restaurants within 5 minutes from us (far superior to both of these).  Value: Markham Sushi is a mid-range Japanese restaurant price wise, but the value you receive in return by far surpasses the price. Most definitely a win here.  The Bottom line: If Japanese is your cuisine of choice, Markham Sushi will surely not disappoint. Everything about our experiences frequenting this place has been nothing but positive every time. We'll continue to hit up Markham Sushi as our 'go-to' for Japanese in Markham. Five stars for us without hesitation.  Tip: Be aware the restaurant is closed Sundays."}
{"text":"A local sushi gem. Markham sushi has the absolute freshest fish. As mentioned many times, this is an a la carte restaurant which means more money but tonnes more quality. I have been here many times and its just always so good! My favourites are the assorted sashimi platter and the spider rolls. TRY THE SPIDER ROLLS- you will not regret it.   Always great food and definitely always great service.   I would also like to mention that on a couple occassions, Mr song, the owner came by the table and felt as though we were still hungry so he have us more rolls for free! He is a very nice man and that was much appreciated."}
{"text":"A nice, quiet mom and pop sort of sushi spot. It has a small but intimate feel to it. Definitely a good place to eat if you're on a date.   Food comes a little slow at times, but the server is so nice you can't really be mad about it. Only negative is that the place is so small, so everyone can hear you if you speak a little louder.  Not my favourite place, but definitely not a bad place to satisfy your sushi cravings."}
{"text":"This is me and my boyfriends absolute favourite sushi restaurant to go to in Markham ! A hidden gem. We first fell in love because of their black dragon roll. Comes out fresh and warm. You can always tell their sashimi is always fresh as well. We've become regular customers that the family that works there always recognizes and welcomes us. They are extremely sweet and always knows what we look for in our orders. I recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good sushi !!  PS. 10% off if you pay cash ! (Take out only)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff...family run business...fresh and delicious sushi and rolls. I like that the menu is constantly adding new items so there is always something new to try. We usually order take out, but the restaurant is quite nice and has been recently updated."}
{"text":"Markham Sushi has been around for years. Since it is hidden inside the plaza, you would not even know it exist when you drive by.... I meant to try them out for a long time but not until now..............  Lunch Specials till 3 pm has a good selections of Teriyaki, Bulgoki, Sushi set starting from $6.99.   The waitress wife was not there when I walked into the empty restaurant, so the sushi chef husband has to serve me and take my order. Quite a few people came in while I waiting for my lunch.  Sushi Lunch Special ($8.99) has a decent selection of fish though 4 of them were salmon. The fish were all fresh and I was a little surprise with their quality.  Private booth does provides a lot of privacy, but it was harder to get any attention when I need any services.  Dinner Bento boxes are all priced reasonable I might come by and try their dinner offerings as it is always good to support local business.  Closed Sundays!!"}
{"text":"Had bento box lunch special. Decent pricy. Little family run restaurant, service can be quite slow during lunch hours. Beef bulgogi was too salty for my liking. Sushi was decent"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow...esp on a Friday   I use to serve, and watching under staffed restaurants is giving me a sore eye.  Food quality very good and service is very friendly.  They only need to work on keeping their customers occupied since the food is slow in delivery.  Then again, this goes back to the under staffed statement."}
{"text":"Friendly service, family sushi restaurant. Fish is sweet and fresh. Nice and quiet environment. I love it!"}
