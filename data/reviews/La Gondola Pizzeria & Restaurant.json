{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy a casual dinner at this great little restaurant.  I am personally addicted to the fabulous pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms.  Just had it tonight, yum!  Everything we've had is fresh and made to order.  We've been going to La Gondola for years.   It's a friendly environment that I would recommend to to everyone."}
{"text":"Wow.  I can't believe I'm writing the first review for this place.  I went to La Gondola not really expecting much, but I walked out having had the best pizza experience since I've been in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere was that of a small, clean, and charming Italian joint, the staff was very nice, and the pizza was DELICIOUS.  Big slices, flavorful sauce and cheese.  The crust was chewy, yet firm.  This family-owned restaurant has been here for a long, long time and they really know what they're doing.  All around wonderful.  Do not pass it up!"}
{"text":"We were passing through Pittsburgh and looking for some pizza. Found this place highly rated on yelp so we kept it simple and ordered an antipasto salad and a pepperoni pizza. It was the best antipasto salad we've ever had and the pizza was definitely some of the best we've ever had. Everything tasted very fresh and had great flavor. Also heard a lot of other customers ordering the meat lovers pizza, so we will pro ably try that next time was pass through. Its in a great location amd has 4 tables of outdoor seating. Service was great and the gentleman working was very friendly. Highly recommend this place, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"So after 4 years of working in downtown Pittsburgh I think I have stumbled upon the worst pizza in the area!   I had a plain slice that didn't seem to be cooked all the way.  Nothing special about the sauce or cheese - just a bland soft slice.  I see a lot of good reviews, but really don't understand that."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago, staying nearby La Gondola. How impressed I was in general. The city was a delight. The little square in which La Gondola Pizzeria is located was so nice to relax in the afternoon sun. 

I had noticed La Gondola while getting my Starbucks coffee. It was very unassuming in decor. Just a small, very retro little place. No one was there, but I saw two older Italian men working in the lit kitchen. I had a hunch this would be an authentic Italian Restaurant, versus the chains.

The first evening I stopped in and ordered the lasagna to go. Wow. I could not stop myself from eating it all. And it was a large portion. It reminded me of the cooking of an Italian family I stayed with when very young. Every day for the rest of the week, I stopped in for pizza, which was equally good. 

Don't let the minimal decorum, or that no one is there, dissuade you from trying it. Get a to-go order. It is fantastic."}
{"text":"All the years I have to market square I never knew this place existed. It's pretty much in the cut. A friend of mine and myself were on a 30 minute break and wanted to grab something to munch on and we wanted to try out a new place and found this place. The people here were VERY friendly and nice but to me they were pretty slow. I ordered stuffed shells and my friend ordered a slice of pizza. Perhaps we should have preordered first but we didn't. I was told my food would take about 13 minutes to make but instead it took about 15-20 minutes - the place wasn't even busy. Most places take 13-15 minutes for stuff shell orders. I had to leave and come back. When I finally got my food there was NO CHEESE on it. Well no mozzarella or anything like expected. Instead it was sprinkled with a thin layer of parmesan cheese. The tomato sauce was some sort of thick tomato paste and the dish itself had no LIFE to it, no CHEESE to it, nothing. It was so disgusting to eat I threw half of it away. For roughly $13, it was a waste of money and my lunch break. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, I dunno but I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and admirable service during what was a very busy Friday evening at Market Place in Pittsburgh during the Christmas holiday season.  We had the 4 cheese and white pizzas (the real names are more Italian but memory does not serve).  The mozzarella covered baked fries are out of this world!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great, simple food and reasonable prices.  The staff is super friendly, too.  Outdoor seating is great and you have a good view of the square.  One of the best slices you'll find downtown."}
{"text":"The Sicilian Pizza is huge, tasty, crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.

My only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.  I want my pizza piping hot, almost burning the roof of my mouth!

The overall taste made up for the temperature difference, and I was happy with the overall experience.  Both the cooks and the waitress were friendly."}
{"text":"Not the best ever, but pretty decent stuff.  A slice for $2.50 in downtown? I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really, really, want to rate this place higher.   Maybe after another visit I will be able to, but the food simply wasn't great.

I ordered the rigatoni al dente, and got it chewy.   The garlic bread was slightly burned and had way too much butter.   The sauce was uninspiring.

For all that, it was that plus a salad for $11, which isn't a bad price.   I suppose I should try the pizza, but the pasta wasn't up to par.  Edible, approaching acceptable, but not quite getting there."}
{"text":"I've been to Chicago and New York.  That being said this is probably the best thin pizza I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG... The most understated Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The owner of the restaurant, Sergio is also the chef.  He makes everything from scratch except the pasta.  But he buys only  imported Italian pasta.  He makes his own mozzarella cheese and grates it fresh for each order   He has a secret menu of low carb, carb free and gluten free items. The eggplant parmesan was amazing! this guy needs to market his culinary quality and creativity better!  He doesn't even post reviews about his restaurant on his window or inside anywhere."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some old coworkers and the experience was rather average and kind of what I expected. The space is out-dated with ripped leather booths, dominated by shades of brown and orange. Totally screamed old pizza place. 

We ordered a large (8 slices) to split between four people. While the pizza was large, the taste was quite average. I didn't find anything special in the flavors and the dough definitely wasn't my favorite. The dough didn't seem to be very yeasty or chewy, which is usually how I like it. 

La Gondola might be a better stop for their sandwiches, but the pizza is average. There are other places in town that I would choose over this one."}
{"text":"If you stop here you MUST get the Sicilian pizza. It is AMAZING and HUGE. Super filling. I'm a huge fan of bread and this did not disappoint. If I were just getting take out I would give this place 5 stars. 
I give La Gondola 4 stars because they did not have a public bathroom. That is extremely odd to me when you have seating to eat in the restaurant. They also do not have high chairs. I had my daughter with me and she sat on my lap. It worked out but could have gotten ugly. The staff were extremely friendly. 
I will be returning knowing that I need to stop somewhere else for a restroom!"}
{"text":"Hooray for gluten-free! I was looking for a gluten-free restaurant in market square, and luckily we saw the hand-written gluten-free sign in the window at La Gondola. I ordered a cheese pizza, and while the crust was pretty standard gluten-free crust (ie, not too tasty), they did a really good job loading it with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce so that the gluten-free quality wasn't a distraction. The service was great and the place wasn't busy at all in an otherwise packed Market Square. I loved it!"}
{"text":"I wanted pizza but there was nowhere particular I wanted to go. I have eaten at every pizza place in downtown and none of them has really wowed me. I happened to stumble across them walking through Market Square when I saw a customer looking excited to go in we nearly bumped into each other. The staff were super friendly & personable. We chatted about other restaurants in the area. The owner actually takes pride in his food.  When he said this will be the best seafood pizza I've ever had I laughed, turns out he was right!! The prices are on par with the other pizzeria's but their dough is homemade, the ingredients are fresh & you can taste the difference. I got my order to go & actually had to call him back to let him know how delicious my pizza was. They now have a lifetime customer. After more than 30 years in business it shows. They seriously are the hidden treasure of Market Square."}
{"text":"A modest little pizza shop that makes darn good pizza and offers a cornucopia of toppings (think smoked turkey, pineapple, crab meat, etc.) Nestled in Market Square amidst the trendy and traditional establishments, it manages to succeed at maintaining the charm of a small-town pizzeria... Since I'm originally from a small town, it gives me a strong dose of nostalgia.
The staff is very friendly and committed to making the food well; it's not the fanciest place, but if you want a large and reasonably priced slice, regular or Sicilian,  this place is just terrific."}
{"text":"The coveted fifth star!

This place probably has the greatest Sicilian pizza I've ever had anywhere...including Sicily!  

A true \"pizza shop\" type place - this is a great stop for those times when you want an easy-to-eat slice and either get going or just hang out and enjoy the square. 

Nothing fancy...just terrific pizza!"}
{"text":"Looks shady, tastes great. Lunch for under $5 a person and you walk out stuffed. What a deal!

Service is fast and friendly. Prices are fair for pizza anywhere, let alone downtown.

When we walked in the door, we were the only customers. Combined with the dated decor, we weren't sure that we had made the right decision. We sat down, ordered a pizza and it was served within 15 minutes. By the time we left, the place was packed with only a few open seats left so it would appear that the secret is out."}
{"text":"Came here two days before Christmas. Looking for a place the family could get a quick slice. Wow! We were surprised. Not only was the pizza phenomenal, it was cheap!  I had the Sicilian and my kids had thin crust. Four pieces total, 3 drinks, came to $17.10. Can't beat that. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was dinkiest restaurant in Market Square, I went to there of the restaurants.  This was the best food I had sence my four days here."}
{"text":"Almost missed this place. Cruising in circles looking for something affordable to eat yet with outdoor seating, but alas closing time is 8 pm and we were there at 7:55 pm... Prize would have been OK, menu too, so we went in and asked if they could give us slices to go. But instead they asked us where we would like to sit and so it turned out they didn't realize they had the mini time on their sign, sending people to the next door place, allegedly closed. 
We were so glad!
I checked some other reviews of this place, and as of the food, here is the thing: if you know North Italian home cooking, this is it. Like that. It is not like in hipster three Michelin star restaurants, and, by the way, if it was and then the same location, the every-day-Joe-Yelp-crowd would not be sitting there, way too expensive. But what do I know who is really sitting where?
What I am saying is: if you want food that was cooked by a human being with an Italian taste this is an excellent place to go to.
And the staff is wonderful, yes, VERY personable, and I am someone I rather sit some nice place eat some good food and talk to a real human being than get served some elegant painting of a dish by a robot or a person who learned a chique greeting phrase by heart.
But that is me and you need to think if that is what you're after.
By the way, besides the delicious and well-sized pizza, the homemade Tiramisu is to die for.
And: apparently you can bring your own booze, please confirm if that is a constant offer.
(Another tip: if you love soccer, talk to Sergio! You will make a friend. Cool, lovely people!)"}
{"text":"I stopped by La Gondola for a quick dinner about two weeks ago before seeing a show in the Cultural District.  I was curious as to how it would compare to the other nearby slice shop, Cafe Milano, which left me underwhelmed.  Ultimately, my assessment of La Gondola ended up being similar, but at least the owner was friendly and didn't aggressively upsell me.

To get an idea of what their pizza is like, I ordered two slices--one of the thick crust Sicilian, and one of the thin crust regular ($2.50 each, I believe).  Additionally, I ordered a small side salad ($3.50).  The salad, while not anything too special, was enjoyable, esp. given the price--I especially enjoyed the generous topping of pizza cheese.  As for the slices, I could tell they were made fresh, based on the amount of time that they took to come out and seeing the owner ladling sauce on them before they went into the oven.  I have to agree with Chip's assessment here--they struck me as fairly average in quality.  While there was nothing wrong with them, per se, they just weren't very memorable.  I can't speak for the toppings, since both of my slices were plain (the thought of ordering a topping occurred to me too late), but a good pizza stands on its own.  While I guess $2.50 is relatively inexpensive downtown (esp. in Market Square, where the rent must be sky high), it's more than I'm used to paying for slices.

On a positive note, the owner was very friendly, as I mentioned--there's always something to be said for service with a smile.  On the flip side, however, the furniture is looking pretty run down, with large visible tears in the upholstery, and could definitely use an overhaul.  Overall, not bad, but also probably not good enough to make me seek it out again, given the competitive downtown dining scene.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Very unassuming, yet authentic local delicious little restaurant in Market Square. Garlic bread was crusty on the outside, warm and soft on the inside. Eggplant Parmigiana dinner was outstanding. Baked after lightly pan fried, with a flavorful marinara and mozzarella layered top. 
BUT - no restroom. Use Starbucks next door. So basically, \"Go, before you come.\""}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME...!  THE BEST PIZZA IN PGH....  You have to try the sicilian...  Great prices... Great Family  Buisness... Same Brothers. in the Same Place for Over 36 years!  Their Obviously Doing Things Right.... Check this place out when you go Downtown...  Very Family Friendly. ..  EVERYONE Loves This Pizza.....  5 Stars !"}
{"text":"I love it- some of the best slices in Pgh!  Large New York size slices- killer wedding soup!"}
{"text":"I eat in Market Square a lot and this is my favorite place to get slices of traditional red sauce pizza out of any pizza place in the area.  I am still partial to Fat Tommy's for white pizza although I haven't ordered white pizza from La Gondola yet.  I have never found La Gondola's pizza slices to be greasy and the crust is perfectly crisped on the bottom and just the right amount of chewy otherwise.  Good quality food and yummy!!  I personally love the crumbled sausage topping.  They also have incredibly awesome homemade Wedding Soup (seasonal I think) - a definite must have when I see that they are serving it.  The staff is always friendly and prompt.  Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"After visiting Pittsburgh for the first time with my husband, we decided to walk around randomly to find something to eat.  It was around happy hour, and it was the only restaurant that wasn't jammed packed.  We decided to try it, and I am so glad we did. Best pizza we've ever had! The server was so sweet, and the chef was exceptionally focused on his craft.  The ONLY problem with the restaurant is that it didn't have a public bathroom, but it's in Market Square, so I could easily go somewhere else.   HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian pizza in Pgh. I've been searching for proper sicilan crust in Pittsburgh for 15 years. This is spot on. One slice will fill you up , but splurge and enjoy 2!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has some excellent pizza. Okay, not the best in Pittsburgh but it is CLEARLY the best in downtown. The boy and I were talking about the number of pizza places downtown that have made us sick and how we thought it was a shame that we consider a place good by the fact it doesn't make us sick. That's the sad reality of it. However, La Gondola has none of those \"sick feelings\" later. We will most likely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for lunch and it was an alright place.   Having heard it was some of the best pizza downtown I was excited going in.    When I came in I snagged a seat quickly, the waitress was extremely friendly and pleasant, having gotten me a drink and a smile in short order.     I had ordered 2 slices of pizza, a choice in retrospect might have been a bit much for lunch as they have a generous slice size.    My pizza came quickly and was good....notice good, not the greatest.   Still I give this place high praise for the service that I received and pretty decent pizza.    I'll be back again in the future to dig deeper into their menu."}
{"text":"The waitress is RACIST. Four of my friends (3 lighter complexion Latin Americans and 1 Namibian) came for lunch. We found a table outside and since we didn't know how the serving worked, one of us (white, Latin American) stayed at the table while the rest went inside and order. As we walked in, I stayed away from the other two because I was on my cellphone. The waitress asked me politely to let her through, I apologized for being in her way and stepped aside - we smiled at each other. When I was in line, my Namibian (the only black one in the group) friend asked the cashier if the food was brought to our table outside or if we should wait, he told her that she (the client) was supposed to wait inside to take her order herself. I ordered and joined them while we waited. As we (along with my Namibian friend) sat down inside the restaurant, we realized the waitress was in fact serving everyone else. I tried to ask her if she could bring our food to our table like everyone else, that's when she started ignoring me. It took three attempts of calling her attention and other clients to notice she was walking past us, for her to address me. I asked her if she could serve our food in our table outside, she started being impolite and told me we had to wait for it ourselves. I noticed another African American woman was waiting for takeout and the cashier brought her food instead of the waitress. Ironically, the waiter went outside and actually asked our other friend for her order. I had enough, went up to the cashier to ask them to bring our food outside like everybody else's. The cashier and cook did step up after this and brought it themselves and served us. As we sat outside she continued to serve (bring drinks, utensils, food, and napkins) to the other 3 (all white) tables around us, walking past us as if we just weren't there. The pizza after this tasted bitter in my mouth. 

In the pictures you can see her serving others around, she didn't even notice we took pictures of her. Her attitude towards others was polite and even sweet, I really can't believe that the reason she was impolite to us and wouldn't serve another African American client is just a coincidence."}
{"text":"I love mushroom pizza. I called to ask if they use canned or fresh mushrooms and the guy on the phone responded, \"nothing in our restaurant is canned.\"  I LOVED his response. I truly enjoyed my pizza and I'll be back for more.  My only disappointment was that they were out of their tiramisu but I am excited to try it soon."}
{"text":"\"La gond\", as my friends and I affectionately call this spot, is in market square, but is a total dive.  I've been going here for almost 8 years and it's the perfect place to eat my feelings and makes a any bad day better.  

I've only gotten their Sicilian because it's so good I haven't had a reason to try their thin crust.  The Sicilian has a crispy bottom/crush and a gooey/thick inside covered with the perfect amount of cheese and your selected toppings.  The mushrooms here are good, not canned.  This is by no means gourmet pizza, but it is beautiful low key goodness! 

They also make a solid chef salad that is big enough to split.  The ranch is not amazing, but it goes well with the pizza for whatever reason."}
{"text":"My friend turned me on to this jewel of Market Square. I'm so happy she did because it is great to satiate that pizza need.

It looks a bit like a hole in the wall but the looks are decieving as it is amazing. You pick your own table and the waitress will wait on you - pretty quickly as well even during lunch hour. I have gotten the small spinach white pizza twice now. It is my regular order now and delicious twice in a row. I also got the small chef salad this time. Mainly cheese and I probably won't be getting that again, but the homemade dressing is very tasty. 

They have a very large menu including desserts. Not sure if I want to stray away from my spinach and white pizza but those mozzarella covered fries are looking pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Cozy little pizza restaurant. We sat outside and were greeted promptly by a very nice women, she was wonderful! Sergio the owner came out and brought our pizza, which was delicious! We ended with tiramisu and espresso, also delicious!"}
{"text":"It's hard to be drawn to this place when its in the recently updated market square but don't let the looks fool you, this place is delicious.

I tried Primanti the day before and I wish I went to La Gondola first. This place had good pizza and service was decent. This place has been family-owned for over 30 years and its apparent why.

I wasn't please with the sausage because it was essentially like in small bits and amounts, but the thin crust was baked just right and the cheese was good as well.

There were no napkins and too much grease on the pizza. No bathroom in site either. I wanted to wash my hands. 

Best food I had in Pittsburgh besides the William Penn Omni Terrace Room.

Next year when I am on a business trip to Pittsburgh I will most likely return."}
{"text":"This is the place to get a great slice of sicilian pizza. 

My co-workers and I agree that this is one of the best sicilian slices in the city. Crispy and airy crust make the enormous slices not too heavy and they hold a lot of toppings really well. Plus their sauce and topping choices really round out this pizza. Their regular NY style slices are decent, but I would definitely go for the sicilian. 

The hoagies are all pretty good too, as a good Italian place should do. Not the most veg-friendly place. Other than the toppings on the pizza, they serve a side salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce, and they put deli ham on the salad, which in my opinion is completely unnecessary. Seems like they are just serving to the over meaty and under-vegged Pittsburgh eaters (who whould be confronted with more good veggie dishes more often). But their homemade Italian dressing is great. 

Service is great here. It's family run and the Grandmother and Mother waitress, always with a smile and friendly banter. Seems like Papa and son are in the kitchen serving up the food. Plus there is outside seating which is often available even on crowded days in the square. 

Looks can be deceiving, because I don't think I would have ever checked this place out by just looking at it from the outside, or inside for that matter. A good recommendation from a friend got me here, so hopefully it works for you too."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at La Gondola's before and I can attest that the baked sandwiches are da bomb.  I wasn't all too hungry for lunch today but felt that I needed to get out and have something so I decided on a slice of pizza. 

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a Pittsburgh Italian family owned pizzeria. Clean yet a little cramped; friendly but not overly so; service not exactly slow but for a simple slice of pizza it wasn't \"freakishly fast\" either. The two waitresses and the two behind the counter doing the cooking seem to be having a good time.

My slice of pizza came and it looked so yummy. The crust was perfectly done and it had cheese artfully oozing over the pepperoni. Esthetically beautiful. Unfortunately when I bit into it, the taste was just average. It wasn't bad, the crust held up just fine but the sauce was lacking \"oomph\"... that zest that you look for when eating pizza (at least it's what I look for). 

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad slice of pizza, just average. Average in taste, average in size, even average in temperature. I wouldn't go out of my way for a slice of pizza here. But I wouldn't put up a fuss if I was with a group and they wanted to go. But I'd probably opt for one of their tasty sandwiches or maybe try one of the pasta dishes over the pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  They have the best house dressing for the salad.   Tried several pasta dishes and pizza.  Their pizza crust was perfect.  So happy to see a real pizza oven.  Yum yum yum!!!!!!!   Oh and I forgot to mention their garlic bread and sauce for the pasta..   Nice to find a non chain place.  Soooooo great.   We will be back next time in downtown Pitt."}
{"text":"For 35 years, La Gondola has sat in an obscure corner of Market Square, unaffected by the upheaval and renewal this area of Downtown Pittsburgh has experienced, looking on quietly as trendy restaurants and fast food franchises have sprouted and withered away. The other night, prior to the Alice In Chains concert at The Benedum, I made it a point to visit, to become acquainted with what I had been missing for far too many sunsets. 

What I was missing was an amply filled half-hoagie that stung with a piquant Italian dressing, refreshed with crisp, juicy vegetables, and comforted with toasty bread and molten cheese. 

What I was missing was a pizza that possesses a paradox of a crust that is luxuriously soft yet sturdy and somewhat crunchy. Rounding it out is a scrumptious, unctuous cheese that partially coats the toppings (mine was pepperoni) like white lace, and a savory, carefully prepared sauce crafted by a master.

That master is La Gondola's soft-spoken, middle-aged owner Sergio who happened to have a Fleetwood Mac concert on the television when I arrived. With him I had a wonderful conversation that touched on the subjects of pizza, food in general, classic rock, Pittsburgh, and life itself. I'd been missing that also. 

\"You know,\" he told me, pointing his finger at the lights above, \"People get leery of comin' in. We have people peek in, the same people, day in day out, but they won't come in. But when they finally do, they end up lovin' our food. All of it's homemade, from scratch. When you make stuff from scratch or anything from the bottom up, you're givin' your heart and soul as well.\" 

\"Like that guy, he's pretty damn good, I'll tell you what,\" Sergio proclaimed while halfway air-guitaring as Lindsey Buckingham performed a solo.

La Gondola is miles and miles more than pretty good, its staying power fueled by a sense of tradition and economy. Ignore the hype of their next door neighbor Winghart's and give the old-school a chance to charm your jaded palate."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and delicious pizza.  What more do you need?  I opted for a make-your-own pizza and ordered a pepperoni and pineapple 14\" medium pie.  Despite a steady flow of customers, the service was fast, and my pizza was delicious.  Plus, my pizza and 20 oz bottled soda rang up for $18--pretty cheap for a quality pizza.  Forget the negative reviews and try the pizza for yourself."}
{"text":"What a great find in market square the inside reminds me of Italy. The guy making the pizza was amazing spinning the dough. They have lots of seating and the place is clean. I was surprised how big the menu is and they had lots of Italian dish's. The best part is you can watch the guy twirl and make the pizzas."}
{"text":"Really not a fan of this place or reheated pizza. If I walk to the register and 3 of you look me dead in my face for a few mins before someone says oh do you need to order? No I'm just standing here for fun. That was my first red flag 15 mins later I get an uncooked small (4 cut) pizza for $10. I just get a weird vibe in this place maybe it's just me. I also hate the fact that the pizza is made, sprinkled with more cheese and put back into the oven. I guess that's efficient to them gross to me. My co worker said is that as bad as it looked my reply was \"yes\" Today's stop was me giving this place a second chance, doubt I ever go back"}
{"text":"Delicious home made authentic italian classics.  Low prices.  Extremely generous portions.  For the same price as a Jimmy John's sandwich or Moe's Burrito, you can have a expertly prepared Italian feast with all fresh ingredients.

Why not a 5?  The service can be slow during the lunch rush, and the interior is a bit run down.  If you aren't in a crazy rush, your money won't go farther for better food anywhere in Market Square."}
{"text":"Just got a medium pizza with all our favorite toppings - it was delicious!!!!  Sergio is the owner and chef, his homemade dough is awesome!!!  I was delighted to meet him and his waitress, Chris - both are very friendly and kind!!!  Definitely going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Chef salad, garlic bread and pizza was amazing. Dinner for two for less than $15 in downtown Pittsburgh. House Italian dressing (homemade) was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
