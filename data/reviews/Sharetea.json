{"text":"Food/drink 4/5
Service 5/5
Atmosphere 4/5

Drink: oolong crema. I had no clue what this was, and I've had plenty of bbt in my life. The crema is the milk, cheese, salt solution at the top of the bbt. The saltiness of the crema definitely contrasts the mellowness of the tea. They give you a lil knife to cut a slit at the top edge, so you can sip on the crema first. I did that and I have to say I think I prefer letting the crema mix into my tea. The flavor was too strong for me. I still liked it because it was different. It didn't taste bad at all, but just not my preference. Definitely something new to try!

Service: staff was very nice and explained what crema was to me and taught me how to drink it. Very patient and very polite. I got bbt take out, so can't judge anything else here since it was only a short encounter. Took maybe 3-5 minutes to make the drinks, which is pretty efficient to me.

Atmosphere: small clean place. Has four tables maybe? Usually people just get bubble tea take out anyways, so not that many tables are needed.

Extra: each day has a special drink for cheaper. Monday was the oolong crema. So if you are uncertain about this crema business but you want to try, go on Monday."}
{"text":"This location got my order wrong and the staff didn't want to refund it. They insisted that it was what I ordered and did not apologize."}
{"text":"My favourite go to Sharetea location. Too bad their location is hidden all the way at the back of the plaza. I usually order Oreo ice blended and it never fails to disappoint me. I also love how their tapioca is soft and chewy. Customer service is OK, the staffs aren't very welcoming as my bf and I are always the first one to greet them hi or bye. There's never a time when I had to wait in line or have any complaints about my order. Very fast and convenient!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered matcha red bean milk tea but it doesn't taste like matcha at all plus they charge a premium for their drinks. They also skimp out on their toppings. Cha time is a lot better and cheaper :((( service was good tho"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. The girls working behind the counter were very nice! My fresh taro slush was made in under 5 minutes. I'm happy that they offer fresh taro here and not the powder, but my slush wasn't blended as well as I would have hoped. There were big and small ice chunks in it.

Also, my total came out to over $6 with tax for a regular size. Pretty expensive for take out bubble tea, but I must say that their tapioca tasted very good. It was nice and chewy and sweet.

I wasn't aware that they had daily specials, but looking at other pictures, they give you 20% off of certain drinks Monday - Thursday. I will have to ask about that the next time I go in. 

They have cute bar tables along the walls with a bigger table in the middle of the store. However, for studying, I would not recommend this place. They play Mandarin music at above average volumes (I could hardly hear what the girl at the counter was saying to me, the music was so loud!), but for hanging out with friends or just editing pictures on your laptop, it's pretty nice.

Will definitely have to come back to try some more flavours, and then maybe I'll be able to increase my rating."}
{"text":"I am 99.9% sure this Sharetea does not source their ingredients from the proper Sharetea supplier, or can even be a fake Sharetea. 

I drink Sharetea's tropical fruit tea once a week from the other two locations (those in North York) and ordered one from this location today. 

The drink tasted completely different than the other two locations' and is absolutely disgusting. I actually had to throw away the $7 tea cus it tasted like cough medicine. This place is a shame and I wonder if it's a fake Sharetea. 

Sharetea should definitely investigate into this store.."}
{"text":"They're always fairly quiet when I go and the service was efficient and courteous. I love Share Tea's fruit tea options but not so much their milk tea varieties (but that's not specific to this store; it's Share Tea in general). Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good drinks. Ordered a mango slush with ice cream and tapioca. Tasted fine but not as good as their North York location. Will be back in in the area and wanting a drink."}
{"text":"My favorite place for BBT... Will never go to other BBT place anymore!! Great service and very helpful stuff!!!"}
{"text":"I had the classic pearl milk tea, and it was really good. I got 30% sugar, and less ice, as I like my BBT concentrated. The tapioca is made well, so it's not too chewy or too soft. My friend got the ruby slush, and the mango green tea, which were pretty good. They recently had a buy-on-get-one promotion. They also has daily specials for 20% off regular price, or something like that. 

NOTE: They accept credit card only if the amount is $5 or more, so have your debit or cash ready.

This newly opened location hasn't worked out their demand VS supply situation, as they are often out of tapioca when I visit mid or late afternoon. Service is a bit slow, as it is obvious the employees are new, and is in the process of learning. However, I'm sure it's just a matter of time they will figure everything out. Definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"MMM, I love me some Sharetea! They have a great points card called Vicinity... buy 10 drinks, get one free! My fave tea is the Taro with Ice cream. What a treat! I always have a positive experience here :)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer that I did not end up purchasing a beverage here because they did not have decaffeinated options for the milk tea (and my last experience w BBT had me up until 5am).  The reason I felt the need to give a low rating is because of the environment.  The servers were perfectly friendly and kind but the space had one lonely table with study books and cigarette packages all over it (due to the two patrons outside squatting while smoking) and the interior had a funky smell to it.  All these things combined did not induce nor entice me to purchase a drink that I originally had walked in really wanting."}
{"text":"Tried their milk tea with Tapioca. It was very watered down. I'm really disappointed after hearing all the hype about this place. The Tapioca was rock hard. It was definitely very hard to chew and not fresh. I really don't recommend this place to anyone. It's also very small and dirty inside."}
{"text":"They've got a great selection of options to choose from. I tried pretty much all of the flavours including their limited edition ones. The quality of the drinks are great. My go-to flavours are the Earl Grey Series. The Handmade Taro is also a favourite of me and my family.

Whenever I feel like a change from my go-to there are always some great limited edition flavours to try. My recent favourite limited edition flavours included their Thai Milk Tea. Delish!!"}
{"text":"Sharetea's bubble tea is one my favourite bubble tea chains in the entire GTA. I love my Chatime, but there's just something about the flavour here that's really exceptional. That's probably why it's on the pricier side but I would pay that value.

Their crema is something that's really unique and oh so yummy. I usually get the coffee crema or wintermelon crema drink. My go to is usually the Hokkaido milk tea with tapioca. I don't know what Hokkaido is, but it tastes hella good. 

The service is quick, but I wish there was a more welcoming vibe. The staff could smile more or feel more approachable. Other than that, it's great here and I'd definitely like to try more drinks!"}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats......was glorious!! 
Here from Atlanta and delivered right to our hotel!"}
{"text":"Used a coupon that was 3 for $10, something close to $3 for a cup. The servers were a little rude, they looked and it and said \"Thats too great of a deal.\" As if it was fake. They don't know what promotions their company is advertising. They then asked if they should make the drink first or scan the barcode. They said tapioca was included in the drink then rescinded their comment. I paid extra for the tapioca which wasn't an issue except for the fact that they forgot to add the tapioca. I didn't look at the drink until I had left. The drink itself wasn't bad. I got the earl gray w/ grass jelly drink. The jelly was a good texture. The service kinda sucked though. Their staff was either new or weren't trained properly or maybe a bit of both. It really wasn't too big of a deal, I just wished the transaction was smoother."}
{"text":"??????sharetea?????????sharetea??????chatime?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????):"}
{"text":"Collect 10 points and get a free drink....BUT you can't get the free drink with the same purchase of the last point.

Are you kidding me???!! Why not? It's FREE! Other bbt places don't have that stipulation. Maybe she just really doesn't like her job.

Plus, the wait is crazy here!! Slow service. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What a great place! I first tried their salty-foam milk tea in the North York location, but that one is out of my way so I went to this one. It's just as good, recommend!"}
{"text":"Best quality milk teas in Scarborough! If you're looking for something more than the average, typical bubble tea, this is the place. Plus, great customer service!

I literally gave up all my other bubble tea spots after I discovered this place.   

Especially love the Mango Milk Earl Grey Tea w/ Tapioca!"}
{"text":"New location in the Plaza at midland and Finch.  At first we had difficulty locating the stores, since we were used to all the bubble tea places at the front of the Plaza.

Its in the far back of the Plaza.  The unit is fairly small with no seating, so it's mainly just a take out.  The drinks took a little while to prepare since the employers were new.  

The downside is each sharetea location has a different points system, so unlike chatime where you can go to any franchise and accumulate points to redeem, sharetea locations have separate points, so if I need to get 10 points for a free drink, I would have to buy 10 cups from the same sharetea location.  

Service and drinks were okay."}
{"text":"I like ShowerTea as well because you end up all sticky from the tea as it explodes all over you. OK that sounded bad.

SureTea is also good because you can be sure you'll like it.

What to get: Okinawa Milk Tea, Whole Lemon Tea.

I've been to 4 Shareteas in Toronto now (there are more, probably like 10 all opened within 6 months), and some of them I've been to multiple times. Of all those 4, every single location had wonderful service, which is a credit to the hiring policies, and to the friendliness of Toronto. This lovely, sweet, ridiculously friendly and gracious girl might be the nicest of the bunch of them. This location made me a wonderful cold Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea (with Brown Sugar) and it was heavenly as expected. Couldn't have loved it much more.

Get this from any location you go to. Their Whole Lemon Tea is also pretty special. And the hot versions of their milk teas are heaven. And make sure you say hi to that sweet girl!"}
{"text":"Drinks: The classic pearl milk tea from here is just so much better than what you find elsewhere - smoother, creamier, and the tea isn't too too strong - a personal preference. Normally I would order something more customized but we came across this during one of their buy one get one (of three choices) free promotions. Now it's my default drink! We've also tried a mango smoothie(?) with ice cream which was quite good. The wintermelon crema is definitely one of their top drinks and for a good reason too! It's kinda cute how they tape a little plastic knife to your drink in case you want to cut open the top and scoop out the cream.
I also like how you can customize sweetness (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%) and ice (none, less, or more).

Customer service/other: not bad, a little on the slow side but I don't mind because they seem to really take care of each drink they make and I'm never in a hurry there anyway. They're pretty nice imo, usually three working at a time with one tending cash and the other two making the drink. It's true that they run out of regular sized tapioca sometimes and may replace with the small ones which I dislike. It's because of the CS factor that I rate 4 instead of 5 stars.

Promotions: either there's a lot of them or maybe I just seem to stumble on them when I go... make sure to get a points card if you go often! You can redeem a free drink for every 10 purchased.

The store/location: it's quite small which isn't a problem unless you were planning on bringing a huge group to chill. They have very limited seats but whenever I went there's never really anyone sitting there. The store is located across from Santouka ramen, near Dundas Square/Eaton Centre, and Ryerson which is perf!

Thanks for reading my review! Hope it helps :)"}
{"text":"I go to this place a few times a month. It's located in a crowded plaza filled with lots of other places that serve bubble tea but this place will treat you right. Nothing beats quality bubble tea + quality customer service."}
{"text":"Got two bubble tea delivered using Ubereats. I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their drinks! We ordered taro ice blend with tapioca and pudding and kiwi fruit tea with aiyu jelly (+aloe vera). Oh boy that kiwi fruit tea was so refreshing! It was my first time trying aiyu jelly, and I enjoyed it a lot. It has a similar texture to grass jelly but without the herbal taste. No wonder this drink is one of the most popular ones on the menu. 
It took me so long to try this place out, and it was my fault for not paying attention to this joint. There is a new location coming up this summer at the waterfront where Beaver tail is. Can't wait to try other drinks from here!"}
{"text":"We recently stopped here on a tour of the city, for their green tea with boba. I prefer the waterfront location, but seeing how this chain of shops may intentionally not have been built for hanging out, that's not saying much.

++
Tea was slightly on the sweet side at 30% but otherwise spot on

Love free WiFi

- -
Uninviting shop space...I'm not sure what else to say here

We asked if we could take a sip of a couple teas, but were sternly told no"}
{"text":"Excellent service. I got the taro bubble tea with the large tapioca balls mixed with red beans. I come back here next time I'm in town. Love it and the service!"}
{"text":"Sunday I was gonna go to Chatime across from the parking lot like I usually go but it was fully packed and I didn't want to wait so I decided to try something new and came here, boy I glad I did. Their employee recommended me their kiwi fruit tea with aiyu, I was so good, so much so that I'm coming back here instead of chatime from now onward."}
{"text":"Got the classic milk tea black with less ice and half sugar, sugar level is probably less than 50%, ice is just right but too much milk.  The whole drink is pretty much all milk and no tea taste.  Pretty bad for Taiwan #1.  Will never come to this place again."}
{"text":"I don't usually get wintermelon flavour but it is advertised as their 2nd best selling. Got it with lychee jelly for $0.50 more. I really enjoyed it. There are a few seats inside to enjoy your drink but I think its mainly a take out place."}
{"text":"My favourite Sharetea location! 

MUST TRY: wintermelon tea creamma and mango milk green tea (something along those lines). Everything is good but these drinks are special to Sharetea and 90% of the reason why I go to Sharetea over Chatime or Coco.

I've been to a lot of different bubble tea joints around Markham, Scarborough, Richmond Hill and Toronto but this is my favourite one! The owners and staff are awesome. They always give really good recommendations and are super nice. A major bonus is that there's never a long wait at this location, I can usually grab and go within 8 minutes. Plus, the last time I went they had a buy one get one free deal!!!"}
{"text":"It is rare to find a good grapefruit tea on a bubble tea menu, especially a fresh fruit bubble tea. This place nails it right in the head. The prices are good and the service speed great."}
{"text":"Sharetea has decent bubble tea but you can find tons of better bubble tea stores in GTA and Toronto. I prefer their bubble tea over many bubble tea franchises in Toronto due to their consistency. 

They have a great selection of beverages, fruity ones, chocolate ones, and caffeinated ones. This location is very close to downtown core, probably 10 minute walk away from Dundas station. The times that I have been here, the store has been empty. They make their drinks quite quickly, and the quality is probably around the same as any other sharetea you go to."}
{"text":"What a shit experience from the moment we arrived.  Putting the indifference of the staff aside, this was the WORST bubble tea we have ever had.

We threw it out after tasting it when we got home.  We ordered the milk bubble tea and a mango bubble tea with no milk.  Very synthetic tasting flavours.  A few of the tapioca balls were stuck together like glue, overcooked or not prepared well.

NASTY place, NASTY bubble tea and NASTY vibe.  It just goes to show:  when people hate their job, their mood is resulted in the end result (i.e. flavor).  The only place in the plaza, we were desperate."}
{"text":"First time to try a crema. In chinese milk foam covered(??), I liked it a lot. It is like a latte tea but the foam of cream is more firm and with a savory and sweet taste. You would be given a small cutter to cut open the seal and sip the foam. It's a must try, the Chat time doesn't have it. The one I tried is oolong / wintermelon crema.
This place is small with two tables and seats facing wall. There was wash room. Good place to rest after shopping in Eaton."}
{"text":"I am from southern California but currently live in Chicago and one thing that Chicago lack is good boba. So whenever I venture to Toronto, I always visit Sharetea as much as I can because it is one of my favorite boba shop in the whole wide world. A few of my favorite drinks are the passion slushy with aiyu jelly or the hokkaido milk tea with boba. If you are driving, there is almost always parking around the corner near Ryerson University.

The staff here are nice and courteous but I can see the wait being long if there are a lot of customers. With no other customers around, my friends and I waited about 5-10 minutes for our drinks to come out but we were in no rush since we were just sitting at the store enjoying their WiFi and AC."}
{"text":"for a location that's empty and just starting off, the customer service is surprisingly horrible. servers are confused and unaccommodating. in case you might be thinking that during my visit something was lost in translation, no, they are rude even in their native tongue.

the decor is sterile and screams grab-and-go.

the tea is mediocre. the lone bright spot in this otherwise forgettable place is that the tapioca is some of the best in the city. 

2 stars. 1 if it weren't for the tapioca.

i hate lining up, but i'd line up for chatime to avoid this place."}
{"text":"The drinks taste great, however the flavours are readily available at any other bubble tea location. There is nothing unique about this shop and there are no promotions available. The prices are a bit steep coming in at $5-6 for a small/regular. I'm sure the high prices are used to cover the branded plastic bags, branded straws, and branded cups."}
{"text":"6/26/15:  Wish we had one of these here in California!  Looks like they got a few stores in Toronto, and this one in particular looks brand new and especially clean inside.  The service is extraordinary with extremely polite and attentive people who will completely customize your boba drink however you want.

Looks like they have a list of questions they ask you, to which my gf asked for:

Classic Milk Black Tea
Large C$0.50 extra
50% Sugar
Normal Ice
No Topping

Flavor-wise we would say it's above average, with good tea flavor and richness.  Maybe not the very bestest there is, but quite good.  7/10

Note that they do have a special signature tea drink which is featured in posters, but we did not try.  Maybe that would be their 10 drink.  Maybe next time.

Anyway, love the concept and how inviting and cool the environment is.

5/5

{"text":"This place is my go to for bbt whenever I'm on campus, I've been going here ever since they first opened and I can say that their drinks are pretty consistent. I always get their classic black pearl milk tea, my favorite!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the drink Earl Grey Milk Tea I ordered today. It's not the best I had but it tasted okay. Something is missing in my usual milk tea. For some reasons, my drink today came out less sugar than it should be because it was not as sweet as it is usually be. It is actually good thing, but I am just wondering if it is because of this location or Sharetea  in general that tend to have less sugar in the milk tea than other bubble tea place. 

Overall, I would come back but not as regular as I would."}
{"text":"Sharetea newest branch in Scarborough. Located inside Skycity sharing the same plaza at Chatime.

Staff here is really friendly and put care in preparing the drinks.

The store itself is really small with no seating area so it is more a takeout place.

{"text":"My friends and I were in Toronto for our Spring Break. While we were driving, one of my friends randomly yelled out \"OMG, they have Sharetea in Toronto, we have to get it.\" Apparently, this chick is obsessed with Sharetea. Secretly, I am a Sharetea lover myself. I am in love with the Lemon Green Tea (they also have black tea too, depending on your mood I guess). The only downside is that the Lemon Green Tea has an actual Lemon in the drink which takes up 1/3 of the cup. Another favorite of mine has to be the Passion Fruit Slush with Aiyu Jelly (50 percent sweet) since 100% is overkilled for me. 

The staffs are friendly, not to mention the high speed Wi-Fi. Since they only have two workers, service can be slow. However, the store has AC which makes waiting more pleasant. This Sharetea does not have a parking lot, so street parking. However, this can be a problem sometimes. I would highly recommend Sharetea over other boba places around Toronto. Sorry Kung Fu Tea, Chatime and Gongcha."}
{"text":"I was told by a friend that this was like the hottest new thing in bubble tea, so we came to try it out after dinner one day. When we came, this location was fairly new, so the decor was a little sparse - this place is not very large, so I wouldn't come and just sit or chill here with friends - definitely more of a grab and go kind of place. My friend had hot milk tea, which I tried and thought was alright, while I got the kiwi with ice jelly fruit tea because it looked interesting and different and is one of their bestsellers. It was refreshing and had real kiwi chunks which I enjoyed. I didn't think it was amazing and haven't been back since that first visit, but I am thinking I should return to try their classic milk tea. As is the norm now, you can customize your ice and sweetness level among other things. They do have some menu offerings that look unique and interesting, so I'd say this place is probably worth checking out if you've never been before."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite bubble tea CHAINS, in Toronto. I've had Sharetea in Melbourne already and the assam milk tea was amazing (hopefully they bring it to Toronto). The shop offers most of the flavours any other bubble tea store would offer these days, it's the taste that brings me back to this one over Chatime or Gongcha. I felt that Sharetea's drinks had more hints of tea in their flavouring and less artificial flavours. 

I recommend trying to oolong / wintermelon crema and the yakult green tea, if you're looking to try something outside of regular milk teas."}
