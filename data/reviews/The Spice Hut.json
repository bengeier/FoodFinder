{"text":"We ordered takeout Friday night and it arrived in 45 minutes, nice and hot and we were happy with all of the dishes.  We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Chili Chicken and the Kale Pakoras.  We like spice and everything was well seasoned.  The chicken dishes came with basmati rice that was cooked perfectly (not mushy) and had cardamom pods and cloves throughout that gave it a nice flavor.  Great quality -- and the delivery was much faster than I thought."}
{"text":"One of the places when I do the all you can eat. Non - veg buffet is only $8.99! The butter chicken is tasty...dang you butter!"}
{"text":"We went her for Mother's Day, and we are glad we did. There was not a rush, considering it is a very small place. The buffet is at the back of the restaurant.  The person who was at the counter, seemed so unsure of everything. It seemed she was in training and she kept having to ask the owner for information.  Food: loved pretty much everything! They had Pani puri, goat curry, chicken curries, malai kofta(my fav, it was delectable), paneer dishes, dal, Gulab jamun(another huge hit), salad bar, various desserts to name a couple. There are not a lot of menu items, but everything was done well.  For a buffet it looks small, but overall, it was delicious. And for $9.99 I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ordered this from an online delivery service. I was a bit skeptical about this place since I could only find a few reviews that sounded like owner reviews. Food came just as ordered. I had the tikka masala, fish pakora and chilli chicken dishes. They were nice and spicy. It's not the best of it's kind but i'd order from here again.  I didn't go to the physical location, so I have no idea how it looks."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet last night. Quite tasty and a good selection for 10.00 dollars. The service could have been a little better for sure. But again, 10 bucks!"}
