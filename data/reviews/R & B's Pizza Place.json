{"text":"I order from here every week. I've tried all the places near here for delivery, but this is easily my favorite. Fast delivery and good food."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings and salads. Haven't tried much else. We love their R&Bs Special pizza. They have specials on combos (two pizzas, pizza and wings, etc). They're pretty quick and have always gotten our order correct."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the R&B's Special Pie (no bacon) last night and the greek salad (added artichokes).  So good!  The pizza was one of the best I have had in a long time, and I eat a lot of pizza! The salad was huge and fed us both easily.  It certainly wasn't as cheap as Dominos, but the quality was great and so delicious.  I would give R&Bs at least $$ when it comes to price, but if you are willing to pay the extra money for good quality, then I highly recommend this pizza joint."}
{"text":"After trying all the pizza places around Brighton Heights , I always know that these guys are consistent and the best.. Food is always hot and delivered earlier than 45 min. People are friendly. Prices are great. Many other great places around here but this is a personal favorite."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite for years. Quality ingredients and decent prices. Portion sizes are above average as well. I love the Greek pizza, but haven't ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered."}
{"text":"R&Bs is very consistent with their food.  Quality pizza and hoagies, Buffalo Chicken pizza and hoagie are both really good.  I recommend."}
{"text":"They don't deliver to me anymore, moved to Lawrenceville.  However, their pizza is good, not too greasy, not too dry.  Nice balance with the sauce cheese and toppings.  They have awesome house rolls, I'm partial to the spinache and feta house rolls.  They are SO delicious.  Pretty cheap.  The delivery time is kind of long, but they are open late, and I love that."}
{"text":"These guys make excellent hoagies. We especially like the supreme Italian and the turkey. Try their pizza, excellent. Don't add too many toppings, you will disguise the great taste of the sauce and the dough. I suggest either plain or pepperoni."}
{"text":"This place is great for traditional pizza, apps, subs and wings. We always get a classic cheese which is always piping hot and cheesy. To feed our cheese fix even more we order the garlic cheesy bread. Just make sure to ask for extra cheese on it if you want the whole thing covered. Love our local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I have made R&B's our Friday night dinner tradition for over a year. the food is consistently amazing, and portions are HUGE. Whether you choose to pick up or have it delivered, it's always less then 30 minutes - and can we take a second to acknowledge the staff? Always exceedingly friendly, and happy to accommodate any special requests. Sadly, we're moving out of the area in two weeks, so we won't be able to continue our tradition. But if you haven't given them a try, do it! (might I suggest the Buffalo Chicken sub and the cheese and bacon fries? epic!)"}
{"text":"The food was ok nothing to rave about but nothing to be to dissapointed about either. I ordered a sandwich with extra meat and was highly dissapointed. I called in to try and get it corrected the guy pretty much brushed me off telling me that's how the do it. I'll let you be the judge by the pic. Well after telling him that i was going to give negative review, he said i was threating him and for me to write my review and hung on me. I waited a few minutes let things simmer down called back and he did send over a free sandwich which was nice, just wish he could have done that from the start. Overall it's decent late night food at a reasonable price, but honestly there's better options during normal operating hours."}
{"text":"Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!  Their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.  The seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \"I taste like iodine\" flavor.  The advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive)."}
{"text":"I stopped by here two nights ago as part of a night where I would try three different pizzas in the Bellevue/Avalon area.  I called my order in for an XL pizza ahead of time and was told that I would have a 15 minute wait until it was ready.  Since I only had a general idea of where it was located I ended up parking near it trying to locate it and then driving past it before finally locating it in a small strip mall right next to Lincoln Ave.  There isn't too much to say about the inside of this pizza place except that they have a counter up front with a little bit of room to wait and no customer seating, not that this is a bad thing.  Pizzas in general can be broken down into three separate components: cheese, crust and sauce.  This pizza actually had the least amount of cheese on it of all of the pizzas that we tried but ended up being my favorite which would be surprsing if you know me.  The cheese was not that strong in flavor but the amount of it let it pair perfectly with the sauce which had a nice spice profile (strong on the garlic and maybe some oregano?) coming through it.  The crust on this pizza was the thinnest of the bunch that we tried and was cooked nicely which also had a little crisp which I loved.    The bottom line for me is that I would head back to R & B's again in the future for pizza.  It was easily the most expensive of the bunch that I bought last night at $12.79 after tax for an XL but as the old adage goes \"You get what you pay for\" and if you like garlic then you should like this pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery when staying at the Sheraton Station Square.   It wasn't super fast but wasn't unreasonable (45mins) and the pizza was so good that I ended up eating way more than I intended.  Not too greesey with a nice balance of cheese, sauce, dough, and toppings."}
{"text":"This is my kind of pizza. I enjoy their roasted red pepper topping on their classic thin pizza.  Try it with the ranch that is garlicky and wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good which is disappointing because the service is terrible. About 50% of the times we have ordered from here they somehow managed to screw up the food.. tonight they screwed up 2 of the 4 items we ordered! I dont know if the person taking the orders has hearing problems or is just being very careless but either way its very irritating getting food I didnt order.. even if its still good food..."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery here last week. I ordered a large pie with pepperoni and well done. The delivery was quick and pizza was hot the delivery guy was very nice and friendly as well. The pizza itself was ok better than some that are around but just ok. I thought they skimped on the pepperoni a little I would probably order from here again as it is close and it is definetly one of the better places in the area"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, awesome wings and okay prices. This is one of the better pizza places around here. I will be ordering again from this place. Must try around the northside area."}
