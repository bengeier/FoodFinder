{"text":"I'm not a fan of the big chain donut shops so I was super excited when they finally opened Alesha's. I didn't want to get my hopes up too high because I didn't want to be disappointed if the donuts were mediocre, but believe me THEY ARE NOT! I'm kind of a Plain Jane so I get the simple glaze donut, maybe a coffee or tea. They are amazing! The dough is so light and fluffy and the glaze is just right. My husband is a big Starbucks black iced coffee guy so he did mention the the coffee might be a little on the lighter side but he LOVES the donuts none the less. We frequent Alesha's often now. I even fill the cake stand on my island with their donuts. (I know that's terrible for me but oh so delicious). The family is very nice and we even got to meet \"Alesha\". A sweet little girl for whom the shop is named. Overall good pricing. Great donuts and nice staff"}
{"text":"We stopped in at 2 pm because my uncle was craving their Boston Creme donuts. I was worried that the donuts wouldn't be fresh in the afternoon, like most donut shops. I WAS SO WRONG! We bought a dozen and they were so light a fluffy. The service here is always friendly, the store extremely clean and always a great selection. This place is worth a drive. We are lucky and live in the area but I would drive miles for these. At 5 am the donuts are still warm and amazing. What we love is that they are never greasy. The simple glazed donuts are very fluffy and light. My husband loves the double chocolate devils food cake donuts. We have never had a less than perfect donut. They have sandwiches and smoothies and more but if you're a donut lover, skip the chains and come to the one and only Alesha's Donuts. They take pride in everything they make, and it shows!"}
{"text":"Donuts to die for! The glazed are absolutely amazing! The service was quick and very friendly, and it was open past 9pm! Very cool find. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing fresh donuts and the owners are fantastic to deal with. Love love love the sweet treats here. Way better thT an Krispy Kreme by far."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty donuts and bagels, nice and fluffy.  Also just as important as having great donuts, they have great customer service."}
{"text":"I love this donut shop. Great customer service and friendly staff. Clean and always smells great. It's a must to sto by."}
{"text":"So I've been here three times already in the last two weeks and it has been a great experience each time. The donuts are great the breakfast sandwiches are awesome and the service is phenomenal.  I don't understand why anybody would go to the McDonald's next door knowing how great this place is.  And one more thing; their prices are unbelievable.  I got a delicious breakfast sandwich made with a soft bagel and gooey cheese, two donuts and a cup of coffee for under $10 INCLUDING a tip that they certainly earned.

Needless to say, we don't have many family owned businesses like this one in our neighborhood.  And we should support them not only because they are local but because they provide GREAT! food and service.

I hope we get more places like this in our neighborhood.  Family owned restaurants, ( more often than not) are the best."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite donut place, the donuts are absolutely amazing. Better than any other places that I've been to and I am so excited to have one around my area finally! I think that every donut lover needs to get this place out!"}
{"text":"love this place!! the doughnuts are to die for, the coffee was great, i haven't tried any of their teas but they seem like they won't disappoint. 10/10"}
{"text":"Donut holes and Maple bar are delicious. Very clean neat place. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a donut shop open in Glendale that was NOT a FRANCHISE !
   My first visit shortly after they opened was a welcome suprise. The other reveiwers said it quite good. Every thing is great especially the service !
   They even have these huge BIRTHDAY DONUTS ! you just gotta get one."}
{"text":"We go to Alesha pretty regularly as part of our pre-church Sunday routine. Every donut we've tried has been delicious and very fresh, and the flavored iced coffee is well-mixed and less expensive than most chain coffee shops. The owners are also very friendly, and always greet us with a smile. 
We definitely prefer Alesha to most of the other donut options in the area, and will continue to go there for our donuts!"}
{"text":"I've been in a couple times and have been happy with the donuts and the great service.  They have the best apple fritters around!"}
{"text":"This donut shop is by far the best i been too, small and local business owner, i am very impress with the place. Service is fast and its funny to watch McDonald's next door with so many cars and people inside and this place barely has 3 people on a Friday. I love it and would recommend to anybody..."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are always fresh and have tons of different styles and toppings to choose from! We have been driving past it for quite sometime and finally stopped in. This is my 2nd time going in and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love coming here everyone is always so friendly and happy to see you. Their donuts are amazing and so are their sandwiches."}
{"text":"My office is nearby and we get these donuts almost once a week, light and airy with plenty flavor."}
{"text":"One of our corner neighborhood food options. It is a beautiful bakery, with a gorgeous case of huge cinnamon rolls, glazed, unglazed, buttermilk, frosted, sprinkled confections. I said, \"No,\" to my sweet-tooth, and proceeded to order two breakfast croissants. The pleasant lady behind the counter excused herself, \"I will be a few minutes,\" proceeding to assemble my bacon, egg and cheese and the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich. The croissant was light and fluffy. The bacon cooked well. Sausage left a synthetic aftertaste. Verdict, might be back for the bacon sandwich, but nay to the sausage sandwich. I would love to try a giant cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"We were also waiting for this place to open, and visited shortly after they opened and bought an assorted dozen. 

These doughnuts were just ok. The dough was light and airy but the fillings were petty generic and scarce.

I love lemmon curd, and make it from scratch,  but the one in these doughnuts was a yellow gel with artificial flavoring.
The maple bar was ok,  not bad,  but nothing special.

Maybe I expected more from this place.  If they work on the fillings, it will be a great doughnut place. It was clean and the attendant was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Arizona. The apple fritter, so fresh, fresh apples. Amazing flavor. Bear claw fresh apples, great flavor.
If you want perfect pastries , you found the place.

The service is perfect too. Nice people ."}
{"text":"Too close to my House. I gained 5 pounds since they moved in. Great donuts great people convenient always open."}
{"text":"The staff here manage to make your brief visit one of the most pleasant things you'll do this day. The store itself is always clean and inviting. The donuts are always warm, light, fluffy and delicious. I wouldn't just recommend this store to anyone, I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"The donuts and pastries are just too good! How am I supposed to make my diet work when faced with temptations like these so close to home!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection and always fresh! I get a dozen or 2 every other Friday for work - they love them too... and what I love is the huge cake donut selection (not just raised) and their croissant breakfast sandwiches (my treat for myself). Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious

The donuts from Alesha are one of those tasty treats everyone should experience at least once in a lifetime. 

Hot, light, and fluffy. I could eat a dozen by myself and for a mere $10 a dozen, what a delicious treat for a reasonable price.   

If you have never visited Alesha to experience a  delicious glazed donuts then you must take advantage of the opportunity if you ever find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"Great donuts my family had them, now they are hooked. I wish there was more variety but beside that GREAT. Owners are very friendly!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I tried the blended Thai tea with passion fruit boba the other day and it was amazing! They have the BEST strawberry banana smoothie.  Donuts taste fresh and always look amazing! You must try this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Just walking in the door, I found my heaven.  The aroma of fresh donuts will certainly turn you into a great mood.  The place is clean, offers a nice variety of donuts, sandwiches, coffees, and shakes.  

The donuts themselves, pretty amazing.  They just melted in my mouth, and unlike some local shops, did not have a taste of grease... Winner! Winner!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite mom & pop donut shops in the area! They have a friendly staff and great tasting, great-priced donuts!"}
{"text":"It's a love and hate thing with donuts; however, this place serves some best donuts I've had but aside from that their breakfast sandwhiches are amazzzzing ! I been there prob 4 or 5 days straight now breakfast sandwhich it up .. recommend this place to any one who loves donuts and sandwhiches"}
{"text":"This has to be the best place for donuts in town! Plus the owners are very nice and seem to always be there."}
{"text":"The softest, fluffiest donuts I've ate. They melt in your mouth without being too sweet. We tried the vanilla sprinkle, chocolate, cinnamon roll, and the croissant. The croissant did seem a little too sweet but it still was good. The owners were really sweet too."}
{"text":"Yummy donuts! Clean and bright shop, minutes from Glendale stadium. I enjoyed a maple glazed sour cream donut and a glazed buttermilk donut. Standard donut options. Wish there were a few creative choices."}
{"text":"We had waited for this place to open, ever since the sign popped up that it was coming soon.  

The donuts are really good, the sandwiches (especially the tuna) are delicious and the smoothies are cold, refreshing and bursting with flavor.

I've picked up the donuts for some family get-togethers in the last few weeks, and everyone raves about them.  Hubby and I have picked up sammies  (on fresh croissants) and had some smoothies, as well.  He likes the coconut, I like the strawberry/banana.

They're very friendly and always have a good selection available."}
{"text":"I always get the coconut ice blended drink with whipped cream. Omg it tastes soooo goood! And the woman that greets me every time is super nice! This place is great and the donuts are nothing special but still yummy too ! Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I've been waiting for a donut shop to open up near my house. The family that owns this shop is super friendly! I went with a friend and we ordered a donut, smoothie, milk tea, and a bagel with cream cheese. Just to try a bit of everything. Was not disappointed anything I ordered. The donuts were light and fluffy, the smoothies super cold, and the bagel (which I'm pretty sure is made there) was amazing! I have never had a home made bagel, and if it was made there t was amazing! Will be going back to try their breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best places for donuts, or breakfast in general in Glendale, very kind owner, amazing donuts, the selection they have is ok, but overall, this place is a great place. Prices aren't bad. I would recommend it to anyone willing to try it!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and absolutely LOVE this place!! Had the blueberry crumb- new favorite!! We also had the cinnamon roll, cinnamon twist, chocolate covered and raspberry filled- all were super fresh and delicious! We also had a couple iced coffees and those were great too!! Love supporting this small, local business!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out a few times to get bette tasting donuts and this place did not disappoint. They shop is clean and the employees are there to greet you and help you. The donuts were soft and fluffy and tasted so good. I like supporting smaller business and was glad this one provided that and tasty food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts clean environment will come back and I will refer my friends and family."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girls & got a half dozen. We each picked out 2 we wanted to try. Aaah-maaazing! We ended up going back juat a couple days later for another half dozen. I'm not usually a huge donut fan but these were fabulous! 

The owner was super friendly & the store is very clean. Glad they've opened!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good! I came to Glendale for a conference and placed an order for 6 dozen donuts for the next day early in the morning. They had them ready even earlier than the time I told them and they were seriously some of the best donuts I've ever had. They are big, fluffy and delicious. Everyone loved them! The workers are so sweet as well. If you're in the Glendale area and want some donuts, come to Alesha's!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! The donuts are great, the selection is huge even for 11 on a Sunday, and the customer service was great! There are even different types of donut holes which my daughter was so excited for."}
