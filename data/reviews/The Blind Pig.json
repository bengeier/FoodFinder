{"text":"This is NOT the Blind PIG of last time I visited !  New menu and only thing on menu that is PIG is pork chop.  No ribs !!!!!   And almost nothing without carbs!   Still a great staff and atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and in general it's fairly good but all the food pretty much end up having the same taste. Everything is OK (really I haven't had anything bad there) but I haven't had any kind of food that stands out either.   It's a good place for lunch with colleagues but there's definitely much better Mexican food around."}
{"text":"The menu as changed!  Sadly, I can here based on yelps pictures of lobster Mac & cheese and the fried pork bites, but the menu has changed and these dishes are no longer offered.... So sad... Nothing on their new menu looked appetizing nor uniquely appealing.  7:42 pm on a Friday evening and the place is empty."}
{"text":"Normally, I love this place but after calling 8 times over the span of a half hour for delivery ( I live in one of the towers) with no answer I'm annoyed. It's 9pm on a Saturday and they choose not to answer. It's ridiculous and is there no manager on duty? This has happened before too. They seem to make up their own hours and close when they want to work. I don't think it's crazy to expect someone to answer at 9pm when they are open until 10/11pm. The towers generate a lot of business. Imagine how much they would get if they actually answered the phone."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and good food in general.  Has some great happy hour specials as well.  Reminds me of a good hotel bar in Manhattan, no strip feel but not shabby like many off strip places that are reasonable on the wallet."}
{"text":"Nice small place. Great tacos and had a comfortable seat outdoors. Friendly server. Will go back."}
{"text":"After reading a few of the reviews my husband and I HAD to try this place...and we are so happy we did!  The pig wings were unbelievable!!! The tacos were scrumptious and chips and guacamole to start were totally addictive!  As this was our fist visit our server was very helpful with the menu and an absolute delight.  The Blind Pig is a little gem tucked in a plaza...you must try this place!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here.... the first time was delicious, great service. Tonight was horrible! The server forgot  my beer, the guac tasted weird, took forever for the food, I asked for another napkin and instead of bringing it the lady started stocking glasses at the bar. I got tired of waiting and got up and asked for one myself.... and to top it all off the only time they checked on us was at the very end of the meal! At that point I just asked for the check because I wanted to leave. The only reason why I am giving three stars is because the girl and the food was so good the first time we went. The two guys serving was too worried about the large party next to us and didn't give any thought to my son and I. Would not recommend with service like that. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Good pasta! Always great service. & convenient for the residents at panorama towers and the Martin tower."}
{"text":"Love this place! I order the antipasto at least once a week. Feeds two, great toppings, weird eggplant- but the mushrooms rock! My GrubHub driver got to me in under forty minutes ;)"}
{"text":"Nice patio next to a fountain with plenty of shade. Ceviche is so salty it stings and is served traditional shrimp cocktail style-floating in a bowl of tomato juice. The chicken tacos were like street meat with gristle n all thrown in. Red sauce flavorful and spicy. Tomatillo sauce reminiscent of pesto. The fabulously creamy coconut sorbet almost rescued the whole meal but not quite. Service was friendly and mostly attentive but I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great experience. Love Uncle Sals so thought we would give The Blind Pig a try. We ordered take out - If you have trouble navigating the website, google \"blind pig menu\" to find all the entrees. We ordered the al pastor tacos, short rib tacos, shrimp tamale, mushroom quesadilla, and ceviche. The standout items were the shrimp tamale and the short rib tacos. We will be back!"}
{"text":"You know those delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurants you just can't keep a secret? Well you've found it. This is the best Mexican food I have ever had, nothing on the menu disappoints. I wish I could keep this spot a locals only place, but it's too good not to share. As others have said, the short rib tacos are great!"}
{"text":"I just want to say Elissa was my server and she made 5 star experience something I will never forget. Not only her personality but the way she is in her work environment you can tell she is genuine. It's hard to come across. Absolutely amazing. She made sure my food tasted good and I had slight hesitation and she made sure again. Very satisfied every time I go. This time topped it with Elissa as my server. Beautiful."}
{"text":"It was impossible to find a breakfast place inside the Bel. So yelp and uber transported me here. Great food, atmosphere and drinks. Plus the prices are far more reasonable than the casino's."}
{"text":"Great food selection, great service! Doesn't feel like your in Vegas, which is great!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great atmosphere!!! Great Servers!!! You will not be disappointed, so many different options, breakfast, lunch, dinner AND store front!! Good was Soooooo good!!! Will let our friends know to stop by when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great mix of authentic Mexican cuisine and modern culinary techniques. Entr√©es have been consistently satisfying every time if been there. Try their house torta it is excellent!!  Staff is always friendly and personable. It has already attracted loyal patrons in the short time it has been open which is always a good sign.   A perfect spot for a an indigenous lunch. Check it out."}
{"text":"THey need to start delivering to Panorama Towers. The food is great, the menu is a bit small, and the prices are a bit high. But for the proximity, I wouldn't mind paying extra for a good meal, especially if it was delivered to my condo."}
{"text":"Meh.   I expected that I would want to give this place 4 stars based on other yelp reviews and some friend recommendations, but no.   Our experience wasn't the greatest.  It began around 630 PM trying to find parking.  There's a red curb out front where cars freely park.  Where are the firefighters going to park? It was happy hour and the place was packed (awesome for business). The staff was very friendly and accommodating but we were confused by who was actually our server.  The food was the least impressive.  We tried the meatballs, pork nuggets and the Poutine.  I expected homemade but I'm pretty sure the pork belly was smothered in some jar sauce and the meatballs were previously frozen.  Also, the gravy in the Poutine seemed like it was from a mix.  This place has so much potential! The interior is cute with exposed brick.  The little store attached is probably great for the residents nearby.  Fix the food, get the staff on the same page and resolve some parking issues and it would be golden."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner today and had an ok experience.   On the positive side, all of the staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was well-prepared and tasty - though a little pricey for the amount you get. I would recommend the wood fired pizza (called \"South of the Border\") which was decent size and flavorful and the Blind Pig salad.  The lounge feel was nice and it wasn't too crowded so you could have a good conversation and enjoy your drink/dinner.  In terms of areas for improvement, there were a few. They need to tweak the menu to give better value (portion to price) on some items and to right-size other items.  (I can't believe they don't have a small side salad that you can order with a main dish.) The serving staff needs to gain a little more experience as they seemed shaky and unfamiliar with some of the menu items. Lastly, beware of the drink sizes! I ordered a glass of wine and received a 3oz pour - about half what you'd expect from a lounge/bar but at full bar prices.  I asked the server about it and she said it was just an illusion because of the glass size - I don't think so!  As they're still pretty new, I'll cut them some slack but they need to work out some of the kinks. I'd give them a few weeks to make some tweaks and then try them again.  There is potential to make this a nice little off-strip lounge/eatery."}
{"text":"Went on a whim and tried this place out with my family during lunch.  It was not busy but I'm glad that didn't deter us. Everything was yummy! We had a variety of pastas and each one had unique and rich flavors and the portions were generous. I had the Eggplant Rollatini which was recommended by our very nice waitress and I'm glad I took her advice. I also had the chance to try the Baked Chicken Breast Dore and would highly recommend it.  Hope this place gets more business in the evening. I'd like to see it succeed. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Quite a good meal but, I HATE THESE OLD MEN. I was having a good time eating but these old men kept being noisy and telling the same jokes over and over, talking about the way things were in their day. Almost made me spit up my food! Like a baby! But I didn't I prayed that their false teeth would fall out and shatter like glass upon which I could dance and stomp my little footsies all around until I was satisfied."}
{"text":"So, I've been here once with definite plans to come back again. The outside area is darling, although will probably be too hot in the coming months. The staff was all courteous and very attentive. But the food...oh the food.  I wanted to go here a long time ago but was shy about it because I saw it was a butcher shop as well and I had a totally different picture in mind. So one day I was like well screw it I need Mexican now, so made my boyfriend meet me there. Ahh, we got the chips and salsa. It is so hard to find good chips and salsa here. I enjoyed each flavor, tomatillo is my favorite but I wasn't so sure at this locations as the flavors in their red was on point. I got the torta, him the short rib. My dish was great! The bread was soft, I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the bread (I mean it's white bread, I guess there isn't a whole lot of that anyways) otherwise it was good! Except there were pickled something I don't remember now because my phone was stolen with the photo on it - pickled anything except pickles go off my list. So I took them off. The short rib was tasty. So tender and flavorful. It was put on top of white rice...which I thought was weird, and that was all. So rice and meat? A mans dish (sorry stereotyping) but all the same good. I've had a patient tell me they have the best house rice in town. I will go back to try.  If I remember correctly...the menu was good, but not a huge selection like some might be used to if you tend to frequent places like Garcia's, Chevy's or whatever the heck places there are here.  Anyways...go. And get the chips and salsa.  I might mention that the same owners own Sal's next door, I should write a review for them too, so good. And around the corner is a smaller bar/wine bar of sorts that I want to say is the side door but I don't remember...haven't been there but if they have same quality it is def a go try."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to eat lunch this past week in Scottsdale, and The Blind Pig kept popping up on our Yelp searches, so we decided to give it a try - and we are glad we did!  It was a slow time of the day (mid-afternoon), and the atmosphere was friendly with nice people and staff.  We ordered guacamole and salsa for an appetizer, and it was excellent.  We really enjoyed the flavor of the two salsas and the guacamole was a perfect blend of ingredients.  We ordered three fish tacos (mahi mahi) and three short rib tacos.  The fish tacos were average, but we all really loved the short rib tacos.  I wish we had ordered all short rib tacos.  The waiter recommended the short rib tacos, and we were a bit hesitant to order them.  They were excellent and I would highly recommend them.  We will be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"The food and the service met and far exceeded Expectations!!!  **The short ribs were fabulous!"}
{"text":"Rude employees!  Hade heard they were playing the UFC fights.  Called first to confirm and was told \"yes\" but you can't reserve a table so to come early.   Arrived early the day of the fight and the place was empty.  Asked an employee if they were still showing the fight.  The employee very rudely responded that they never show the fights. In mid sentence trying to respond, the employee turned around and walked away! RUDE. Absolutely the worst customer service! Never again will we set foot in this place!"}
{"text":"This little place might not look much at the first glance. But, it's def not your usual butcher shop/ restaurant. My friend and I shared the recommended \"Pork Wing\" and the \"Wild Mushroom Quesadia\". The dishes were presented nicely with side of radish/ onion/ carrots salad. A nuevo-fusion style of Mexican side, i would add. The pork wing idea was neat and the wild mushroom flavor was rather flavorful and not greasy.  The two of us just wished we had bigger stomach to try more items on the menu.  Can't wait to go back and try their pizza and tamale soon."}
{"text":"Shrimp and corn tamale is everything you can dream of. Yum. Service was great. Ceviche was really good. A really nice little place to get some great food and a couple drinks."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp because we were looking for a place to eat in the area.  We were hungry and ordered too much food.  We stared off with the queso fundido and guacamole and chips.  Yes, the menu said the queso fundido had beans but it wasn't what we were expecting.  Too much beans and not enough cheese!  The guacamole was delicious.  Our meals were the Pambazo \"house special\" sandwich and the torta.  The house special sandwich was very good and the better of the two.  The torta had too much bread.  Overall, not authentic Mexican food and I guess not what we were wanting, hence the three stars."}
{"text":"First time here this weekend and it was awesome! I had the chicken nachos which were fantastic! Nice patio area and great service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So after having taking about a year off from going to fun new places due to my new fabulous baby , I had been wanting to check this place out for MONTHS. Finally I made it in with a few of my girlfriends (the hubs was a little annoyed to miss out, sorry guy!)  First - this place isn't huge. The staff is super accommodating and tries to make it work, but just know that if you have a large group or if you are heading over during a busy time, you may have to wait.   I had heard that during the day there is a butcher shop inside, and while we sat & talked I took a peek at that menu. I am planning on heading over this weekend to pick up some steaks to grill at home - it all looked delicious.  We all split a bottle of Pinot Noir, and ordered a bunch of items to share. The guac appetizer is delish, and we shared the mushroom quesadilla which surprised me with how good it was. I'm normally not a fan of quesadillas, so I'm always happy to be proven wrong.  We ordered the pork sandwich (I don't remember the name) and HOLY CRAP it was incredible! I had a hard time sharing and felt guilty that the hubs wasn't there to try it.   We'll definitely be back. Loved all the food and the friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh The Blind Pig...what can I say about you?  How about that you serve some of THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD!!!  Seriously.  Dining in Scottsdale was an absolute joy seeing as to how many high quality dining establishments there are there.  So when a special one comes about, I can't stop gloating about it.   Unfortunately I moved away only a couple of weeks after discovering you so I won't be back for a while (unless you're thinking of opening up a Blind Pig in Dallas, TX).  But I will recommend you whole-heartedly to absolutely anyone interested in a different spin on Mexican food.    PS: Your steak and grilled veggie quesadilla had me in tears.  It was pure perfection.  It's unfair how high you set the bar with that one because now no quesadilla is remotely as good or memorable."}
{"text":"Great food and spirits - management lacking  We ordered a 1/2 pep 1/2 jalapeno pizza  What we got was 1/2 pep 1/2 onions.  Instead of having them remake the whole pizza we asked to not be charged for the topping we didn't order and just give us a side of (raw) jalapenos.  They still charged us and refused to take it off the bill saying the side cost 1$ (they charged us $1.25).   I could care less about $1, just honor what you tell your patrons.  The manager Kyle was not rude, but he was also not apologetic and still tried to insist we be charged.    Lesson Blind Pig:  Local residents are your bread and butter, when in doubt make them happy.  Hopefully just an isolated incident."}
{"text":"The food was extraordinary! They didn't have an item so they gave us free salsa and chips, plus the chips were extremely awesome! We will definitely come back again nice!"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place via other Yelp reviews while in the area and decided to give it a shot.  We've been back 2x now and this little place is now a permanent on our 'must eat at' places.  This is not a 'typical' Mexican food restaurant; there are some unique - and very tasty - twists to the standard fare on the menu.  Burritos are amazing!"}
{"text":"Maybe just an off day, but we stopped in for lunch based off reviews and are kinda bummed we did. We were the first ones there right when they opened. The table was sticky and it didn't feel very clean. The fish tacos smelled a bit funky when they came out and tasted very fishy. My husband got the steak tacos and the meat was crumbly and dry. There wasn't much else to the tacos except cabbage. The salsas were good, but very little comes with the meal. The side of rice was delicious but left a bad taste in my mouth when we left. The soda was flat and even worse when I asked for a new one. The patio looked cute for a strip mall. The place filled up fast with regulars so something must be good!"}
{"text":"Great owner operated spot with easy access via cab from the Strip for a meal with drinks that puts \"shame\" on the resort machines that are capitalizing on your buck.  Porter Pork Chop was the best I've had in years.  Thanks Thomas!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The La Florida Coconut specialty drink tastes amazing and I got it for free through the special deal on yelp. So don't forget to use it.  I tried the Reuben on gluten free bread.... Yummm is all I have to say about it. They even let me change the side to a house salad. Hey I have to balance out my meal with some sort of greens. Overall a great experience especially since I went on my own."}
{"text":"I ate here for a business lunch yesterday.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!  I had the sweet corn tamale with grilled shrimp.  The cilantro cream sauce was so yummy that after I finished the tamale and shrimp, I began slopping it up with the tortilla chips they graciously left at the table.  The service was EXCELLENT and I will be returning here again this week to try their short rib entree.  Again, I highly recommend it and can't wait to bring my family here.  I swear, this is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale.  Great food and great value!"}
{"text":"The butchers are great here - we visit almost weekly. Haven't tried the restaurant yet, but hope to, soon!"}
{"text":"I don't understand these ratings. Yelp has never let me down. However, I told my husband this is where I wanted to go when We visited AZ recently and I ordered tacos. They were the worst tacos I've ever had. There were 2 flour tortillas  with carne asada and shredded cabbage on top. My husband did not like his carne asada burrito either.  Meat was like little bullets of spicy meat. The margaritas were OK but nothing special. The one good thing was the key lime pie which was outstanding. That's why I'm giving this restaurant one star but not worth going back."}
{"text":"I came to The Blind Pig twice, since I live at Panorama Towers and it's a very short walk downstairs.   First time: I came here to watch the NBA playoffs, so I sat at the bar. Ordered the BP Burger which was great - grass fed beef really helped with the flavor. It came with a small side of coleslaw. For $12, it was a B+ in my book.  For $3, I also got a square of the coffee cake. It was really good! Grade: A  Second time: I decided to order a pizza - the BP Classic. For $15, I'd give it a grade of B. That price is kind of meh.. (Domino's anyone??) haha. However, if you are desperate for pizza, it isn't bad."}
{"text":"Quality eats at a good price. Lobster mac and cheese $17, loaded lobster roll $15, juicy grass fed beef burger for $12.   Forward thinking American food fused with worldly flavors. We ordered many dishes and sampled from one another. The lobster mac and cheese was light yet rich; the pasta shells were large (not macaroni) and prepared slightly past al dente - perfect. The seared tuna was so buttery and served on a bed of Mediterranean orzo. The roasted pork sandwich was so flavorful and tasty. The lobster roll was simple but so good; it was filled with a generous amount of meat, the mayo dressing wasn't too much, and the bun was perfectly toasted. The burger was a grass fed beef patty topped with Gruyere and garlic aioli btwn a sesame bun.   We came in for an early lunch and were a little hesitant bc the place was nearly empty. The decor is best described as an upscale cafe with a romantic steakhouse vibe. The staff is super friendly and the service is very attentive.   Definitely will come eat here again.   Pros: awesome food that is light yet filling, great operating hours Cons: none"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. We will definitely be back. Poutin delish, Ruben awesome so flavorful. Lobster Mac n cheese the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had dinner there. The service was very friendly and fast.  The food was very good. I had short rib tacos and house rice. The food prices are very reasonable and the quality is top notch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret in Scottsdale! With Carlsbad Tavern just across the street, I would easily say this is better. Better than any Mexican food restaurant in town! Order the chipotle glazed braised short rib over their house rice and your mind will be blown! Their al pastor meat is also delectable. You won't be disappointed if you're in the mood for a lot of flavor!"}
{"text":"The reason this gets two stars is because their avocado bruschetta was interestingly good. And i like the idea of mexi/italian food! However, they need a new bar tender. My guests beer was poured all frothy and not only did it make the glass all sticky but when it settled there was half a beer left. They also forgot my drink but didn't forget to charge for it! I don't recommend going for drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the short rib and carne asada tacos a la carte...you know...so I could sample more on my own. :) added on guac and cheese of course. I would totally come back for the short rib tacos!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot, atmosphere and decor are on point. Service was good. We got the queso fundido as an appetizer and it was delicious. I got the steak salad, my girlfriend got the nachos with al pastor pork. My steak was ordered med rare, came out med well + Nachos were pretty good though. Pretty inexpensive as well.  Food - 3 Service - 4   Probably rate a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"The short rib is to die for. Everything else ive tried has always been good. The mushroom quesadillas are massive. Great place to try"}
{"text":"Can't believe the nachos aren't mentioned more in the reviews here. I love this place and frequently go for lunch.   Nachos are fantastic, especially with the al pastor pork. The care Asada is very good as well. Both varieties come with the amazing white cheese that this place has, I can't get enough. For further cheesiness get the wild mushroom quesadilla. Tacos and sandwiches are good too, I prefer the chicken milanesa. Not feeling nachos? Try the smokehouse baked potato.  I've never had a problem with the service. They are always friendly and quick. Try this place out; very affordable good food. Oh and GET THE NACHOS!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible. Ordered an appetizer to start off. We got our meals first. When the manager walked by and asked how we were doing we said we didn't get our appetizer.  He checked and said the server forgot to put it in. We said to just skip it, no big deal. It should have ended there and all's good. The server then walked over and lied and blamed the kitchen. We said no big deal, accepting the lie and said just forget it.  As they were taking our plates away the appetizer shows up. We don't eat it because it's time has passed. Now the good part. We ask for the bill and there it is. The appetizer is charged, even when we said don't bring it twice, two different people... Not good!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot just right below the Panorama towers. Nice decor. Awesome service. I just love this place! Some of my favorites are the lobster mac n cheese(it is to die for!) the Urth burger (they make their own mayo in house!) and the Kale green salad. Honestly, everything is so good here!"}
{"text":"I read about this place in the Phoenix Magazine as \"best new restaurants\".  I am sorry but there was nothing best about this place.  I had the torta that was featured in the magazine and it was not good at all.  It had zero flavor, the sauce they put on the side has no flavor either.  I don't know what they use for chicken but it is lame.  It was like dried leftover pieces of dark meat that people would just toss (I am talking not real chucks of meat here).  I had chunks of cartilage, and other gross things, and it was dry, dry, dry and again no flavor.  I guess the meat just turned me off.  My husband got the pork sandwich with the coleslaw and said it was OK. He ended up only eating the pork because the slaw was overly salty and there was a lot of that piled on there.  Overall, I would not be giving this place a second chance, just not worth it with all the other places to eat.  If your in the area go down to the next corner and eat at the pig and pickle, that actually deserves a \"best\" nod."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the area.  Al pastor tacos, short rib tacos, queso fundido, and the shrimp tamale are all amazing.  Prices are very reasonable and the drinks are good.  Butcher shop being there to pick up some grass fed beef on the way out is an awesome bonus!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, unique food and the service bent over backwards to make sure this was the perfect gathering. A great place to have a gathering for a large group."}
{"text":"The place was a little difficult to find, but once I got here it was definitely worth the drive! I got the green revolution smoothie and it was pretty good. I would for sure come back here again next time I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Very good food. Reasonable prices. Great service. The short rib on house rice is a must try."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! This is a quaint restaurant tucked in the back of a shopping center, with a perfect sized outdoor patio. The food was ridiculously amazing! Started with the avocado bruschetta, huge chunks of fresh avocado with tomatoes and a kick of hot sauce on lightly toasted buttered bread. Flavor explosion! For my meal I had the al pastor tacos and a side of their house rice. The meat was tender and the veggies and salsa were fresh and crisp. The house rice was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spices as well as chopped chopped chorizo embedded in between the tasty grains. Topped off the evening with a piece of their key lime pie, and I was in foodie heaven! Our waitress Erica was attentive, personable and very sweet. It made our dining experience at The Blind Pig exceptional. Highly recommend this restaurant and can not wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is still a little undiscovered which makes it nice for me because I like a quality spot that isn't already invaded.  I've come down here a few times to get dinner and have not yet been disappointed by the chef.  BP Porchetta is my go to...highly recommended.  That's not the reason why I'm 5 starring on yelp though... I was sitting at the bar and Brittany, the brunette bartender, was mixing up a drink that was very involved....lots of ingredients in it.  I was amused by the effort so I asked if I could try it.  I'm not a cocktail person and I was mainly just asking so that I could taste what a prepared Blind Pig cocktail tastes like.  Brittany is a kind bartender, so she gave me a bit of what she made.  It was not what I expected.  It was probably one of the best prepared drinks that I've ever had.  It's called a \"bad hair day\", and it's something that she created herself for the menu.  It's a very feminine drink, but I have to say that I appreciate the craft of the drink and the effort that went into it.  It was very smooth and something that I feel is deserving of recognition.    I'm a guy and would not order something like this on a normal occasion...but for any girls who read this post...or any guys who are ordering drinks for their date...I highly recommend Brittany's \"Bad Hair Day\".  Brittany-if you read yelp posts then here's your props.  Stop being so modest...you should be in the mixology competitions."}
{"text":"My wife and I try to come here at least twice a month. Liz and the others make every dining experience wonderful. Our favorites are the oyster rockefeller, crab mango stack, mushroom quesadilla, and the incredible grilled shrimp tamale. The tamale will change your life if you let it. But seriously, everything is great. (I'd like to mention a couple other key/delicious players: mac & cheese, tacos al pastor, tequitos, guacamole etc) if I keep going I would have to list the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. This is more the classier style of Mexican food, but since it is in a strip mall it is still very casual. The restaurant is nice and they have a nice patio area too. The bar isn't huge, but it'd be a good place to get a drink and a meal. The tacos and beans are tasty, but I'm not a fan of the beans though. I'd pick the rice when ordering a combo plate. Other than that I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Get the nachos. Please. Unless you're allergic to nachos, get the nachos. They are to die for. When my sister and I went there, we ate the nachos for our dinner, basically. And I am not even a fan of cheese. Amazing.  The service is great, and the food is delicious. The prices are pretty low as well. The location is sort of hidden, but it's not a problem."}
{"text":"I liked it. They can almost fool you until they serve you the Poutine...   Our server, a girl who had an uncanny resemblance to Dolly Parton gone Vegas, served me a completely flat sparkling Rose. Womp Womp!  Okay, she comped it... but still.   The food isnt panty-dropping quality, but hey, if I, who can look past the worst poutine Ive ever seen, sit back and enjoy the people watching and cool decor with exposed bricks while I sip on my flat sparkling Rose, so can you. -AND- it's reasonably priced. I liked the pork belly \"nuggets\" (fritters) and I heard the burger was good.  Im just happy to support someone who is trying -and succeeding- at doing their own thing away from the sysco-ridden, overcrowded, over-priced, downright shameful strip restaurants. Props to you, Blind Pig...   Worth a try. (Maybe pick a more original name)"}
{"text":"Went here for after work drinks and some food with a group of about 10, and had a pretty crappy experience overall. Waitress was inattentive and ignorant of the menu items, and just generally did a bad job of things. At one point she was trying to open a bottle of wine and completely gave up after mauling the cork and causing bits of it to get in the wine, and went back to the bartender to open it. When we were ready to go, we asked to split up the checks or pay with different cards; we were then told by the waitress they only split it two ways. Sorry, no one really wants to foot a $300 bill! The manager came over and explained to us that it was too much of a hassle to split checks, and you have to manually split it in the billing app. Fucking seriously?! Coming over to customers paying $300 for service and saying providing said service is too much of a hassle?! None of us will be going there again."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit the Blind Pig. It is right outside the Panorama condos and I see it often on my way to work. Today I finally decided to stop by and see what it was all about. And I must say I am very underwhelmed by my experience. First off the food. From reading previous reviews I had decided to get the lobster  roll. Sadly when I looked at the menu today, there was no lobster roll. So I settled for the lobster ravioli which had a rich, creamy sauce, but a rather dry filling. It was good enough to finish. After my meal I ordered the Cafe Mocha for dessert. Please don't waste your money. First off there was no steamed milk in my mocha which was the first sign that something was off. Actually I take that back. The first sign that something was off was the very obvious chunks of hot chocolate powder used in lieu of real hot chocolate or chocolate syrup. This was by far the worst mocha I have ever had. I was so disappointed. Based on previous reviews, it appears that things have gone down at the Blind Pig. Now in regards to service. I walk in at about 2:30 pm and I'm not acknowledged and sat down until 2:50 pm. After that my waitress, who never introduced herself, was as scarce as possible. I had to actually go seek her in order to get my check. It was incredibly slow so there was no reason for the lack of service. That is never good. One last thing that stood out was the lack of professionalism. I could actually see one of the bartenders bright pink bra and instead of tending to the customers and moving food quickly waitresses were hanging out at the bar talking. Overall it was not bad enough to be featured on Kitchen Nightmares,  but I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are addicted to the BP Burger! It is one of the best burger's we've had (we live bi-costal) and the sweet potato fries are phenomenal as well.   However, we feel that an extra $3 for the sweet potato fries is overpriced as well as the menu, but the food is so delicious that it's worth the cost."}
{"text":"Forgot to Yelp about this. Went for Lunch last Sunday because my freakin' friends wouldn't shut up about it. Let me tell you - they are very smart eaters. The Blind Pig sets a new standard for contemporary Mexican cuisine in this town, and I do not say that lightly. The shrimp tamale is pure poetry and the ceviche is among the best I've ever had here in the U.S. RUN, don't walk, to The Blind Pig. Chef Jimmy is a genius!"}
{"text":"Much like everyone else has said great ambiance,  but that's petty much where it ends.  Sat at the bar ordered the crispy pork nuggets, inside out spicy tuna and a pizza.  Pork nuggets were terrible, not crispy and extremely dry.  The spicy tuna was good basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll should have a soy marinade or sauce with it though.  Pizza was ok nothing special,  at least the toppings seemed of high quality.  Out the door with tip for two people about 120 a little bit pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"WOW such an amazing place!!! Everything is made with love you can both see and taste. Chef John is a master of his craft. Crispy pork nuggets...... Heaven on a plate! Gotta come here. Breakfast , lunch , dinner.... It's all tasty."}
{"text":"very chill, great staff that pays attention but not too much attention (if that makes sense haha). Sweet corn tamale is the shiz and so are the pig wangz. Go there, supper tasty =)."}
{"text":"Great drinks, really good food, service good, But food is slow, slow ,slow, didn't use to be that way. Last three visits waiting over an hour for food.  If you have 3-4 hours to kill for dinner, great place. Sitting here again at 1 hour and 20 minutes, still no food. After regulars quit coming, maybe then they can serve the handful of customers who will remain. Too bad"}
{"text":"We were very fortunate to have The Blind Pig very near our hotel and that we were too tired on arrival to go over to the Strip to eat.   This place is excellent, so much so that we went twice during our stay.  The variety of food selections allows for everything from quick sandwiches up to perfectly prepared Italian fare.  The first night, we had ordered to-go, but opted instead to stay and eat.  The antipasto salad was delicious and the burgers are top-notch as well, as I've noted before, I'm a sucker for an egg on top of a burger, especially if pairs with thick-sliced bacon!  The second night, we decided to go with nice, slower paced sit-down.  Wow, what a good choice this was!  Full disclosure...there was a problem with one of our dishes and they went above and beyond to make it right and make absolutely certain we were happy with our meal in the end.  Do not visit here and neglect an opportunity to enjoy the Garlic Knots...you will regret that.  The pasta dishes were perfectly prepared and the portion size allowed for some leftovers (even for me).  Finally, the cannolis night-capped the meal and did not disappoint!  In short, take a chance, get a block off the strip behind Aria/Vdara and eat at The Blind Pig!!"}
{"text":"We were four diners here from LA to attend a wedding on Sunday. Our friends had eaten at  Cesar's Palace expensive steak dinner house and were a tad disappointed:-(. Wanting to go off the strip we selected the BP and were amazingly surprised. The double pork chop entry with saut√©ed spinach was cooked to perfection; the grilled chicken with a side of pasta on Alfredo sauce and a healthy serving of saut√©ed spinach did not disappoint; and the panini salmon with mixed greens was a huge serving so much so that I shared the entry with my girlfriend. It was chock full with \"fresh\" salmon accompanied by a great aioli pesto. And fresh warm french bread for the table. The only thing that did not work was the cosmopolitan which was way toooo sweet but I should have brought it to the attention of our server who by the way was very attentive. If you are going to a show give yourself time because it took a while to get our meals on the table. The quality of the food was what you would expect to find at your favorite bistro with a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Too bad it took 45 minutes to get served lunch and, Bob, the owner refused to adjust the bill. We have been regulars, enjoy the food and will not return."}
{"text":"I think I need to give this place another try. From all the fantastic Yelp reviews I expected to LOVE it...but service and some mix ups with our order kinda put a damper on things.   Our waitress was admittedly brand new and had only tried 1-2 things on the menu, so she couldn't really anwser any of our questions about the dishes.   A few minutes after putting in our order we were told the kitchen ran out of bolillo rolls for the Torta Ahogada. We ended up substituting it with a Portuguese roll (tasted very similar to a bolillo). When our food did come out the tacos were on flour tortillas (yuk) and not corn like we asked for and the torta was NOT ahogada (drowned) like we specifically asked for.   However everything tasted great! Drinks were strong and delicious. Guacamole was fresh and a great price. The Mahi had a great flavor and I really liked the pickled veggies that came with the torta.   Like I said I will def give this place another try! I think we just had some bad luck with a new server and the kitchen not being prepared for busy weekend."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and just had to try this place, although I was a little skeptical about a restaurant in a butcher shop.  It was fabulous.  So many reviewers recommended the shrimp and corn tamale that I ordered it.  It was delicious.  The drinks are generous and it was comfortable sitting inside - plenty of room."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig opened a few months ago and is close to our neighborhood but I would drive a good distance for this food!!  The food is so fresh tasting. My husband had the Ceviche and loved it!  I had the Crispy Corn Taquitos ...soooo good!!!  The portions are very generous and prices very reasonable. I can't wait to try everything on the menu. Oh...and the outdoor patio is very nice and relaxing. Servers are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I have been eating at The Bling Pig for years! I LOVE their Wild Mushroom Quesadilla and Fresh Avocado Bruschetta! My boyfriend LOVES the Pig's Mexican Pizza. I also love the al Pastor tacos and Torta Ahogada sandwich! The staff is always very friendly and keeps the drinks filled. I love that it is so small and cozy. We miss Hobe Meats in there though. Too bad that was taken out. One of our very favorite spots to eat and relax!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are here today after our hike in the heat. We were starving and craving Mexican food. I had read about this place on yelp and had it bookmarked so we decided to try it! I love how different their options are. Definitely not your typical Mexican restaurant but the flavors are authentic to me. We had the pig wings and those were so so good. It comes with a little pickled salad as well and I was obsessed with it. And that jalape√±o ranch? Get outta town. My friend got the taquitos and beans. Both super tasty. And I got the famous shrimp and corn tamale. Tons of flavor. Amazing sauce. Shrimp were cooked perfectly. My only issue with it was that the corn was too sweet for my taste. But that's just because I don't like sweet stuff. It was really an awesome dish. Shit, even their lemonade was good. And on top of that we had great service from the sweetest man. Didn't catch his name though. I'm coming back to try the mushroom quesadilla and the al pastor. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Must place in Las Vegas... food is above standard.. great menu. Was introduced to resturant by Hog Car Tours of las Vegas.  The french fries were out of this world."}
{"text":"very good food. quaint and upscale but you can be casual there.  A classy bar where you can have good food and watch a game, but also appropriate for a first date, or date night with your long-time spouse.  It has a deli-type take out section and a small dining room/bar but the decor is very classy. Modern and comfortable. Been there once and will definitely go back!  You can go in casual attire, or have a business meeting over lunch at one of the tables or booths."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! Higher end Mexican food for a pretty good price."}
{"text":"Horrible, rude service, and lack-luster food!  We had called them the day before to make reservations, and asked if we would be able to watch a a particular sporting event on one of their many TVs (all showing different sports). We got their, ordered some appetizers; I then asked the bartender if we could put this event on one of their TVs.  I kid you not, all he said was \"No,\" turned around, and walked away! No explanation or anything!  I then went to go outside to text all of our friends who were on their way down that we couldn't watch the event, when another employee walked up to me and asked if I needed any help. When I started to answer that I would like to watch this event, he interrupted me with a \"Meh\" and walked away! At which point, it was obvious they didn't need our business, so we left."}
{"text":"So delicious.  I think if you choose anything off of the menu you would be so satisfied and excited with what you got.  Service was great.   Krystale was probably one of the best waitress I ever had.  The decor is lovely  and intimate."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING! I was in LOVE with the spicy pork burrito. However, we watched our waiter serve himself many drinks. He dumped water on us twice and spilled our chips before they were brought to the table. He kept disappearing into the bathroom instead of grabbing our bill too, so it made for an unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the short rib tacos and guacamole. The seasoning is amazing and meat is perfectly tender. The salsa is a bit on the spicy side but it was yummy. This is a casual laid back place with great food. Service is friendly and place is unassuming. Also tried the carne asada and it was just as perfect. Their rice is an unexpected twist with pineapple and chorizo."}
{"text":"Drove 15 min from Scottsdale, but suuuper worth it---even better than some of the more expensive ribs/meat places! Lunch on the patio: $7 pig wings + $10 adobo short ribs on house rice....not disappointed! Fast service, nice ambience, and good food. You get your money's worth ;)"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for lunch on her last afternoon of her Vegas trip. We both ended up getting the lobster shrimp Mac and cheese. Great portion sizes, very attentive wait staff ( ice tea refill at 1/4 left every time) and very nice atmosphere.  We didn't get to check out the store but it looked great from a quick glance. Over all great lunch. Clean, a very pleasant staff, good food but lack of parking is the only draw back and why I can't go 5 stars. Nothing to do with the dinning experience but parking is the first thing you do when get anywhere.  A must try for locals!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, with just enough of a gourmet twist to keep it authentic. Beer selection is good but limited to Mexican beers (the IPA is great). Prices  are very reasonable and the atmosphere is just what you would expect for old town Scottsdale. Try it, I really think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great selection of alcohol and food! Great service. They have a good pizzas"}
{"text":"Great food! Good scene.. Intimate environment and amazing drinks! The staff was friendly and accommodating.. I will definitely be back with my next conquest!"}
{"text":"We literally just left this place and it is amazing, a must try! We ordered the salsas and guacamole with chips trio, pig wings, torta ahogada, and shrimp tamale. Everything was delicious and I recommend trying all of these. We will definitely be back again! The staff and drinks are wonderful too."}
{"text":"My business partner Derek and I came here for the first time today and each had the tacos.... The best grilled meat tacos we've ever had and they were generous portions!!!  The staff is incredibly friendly and just a very cool and authentic neighborhood restaurant and bar.  The Blind Pig is legit!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend and was looking for a place to watch UFC 198.  Let me tell this place was awesome. Good food, prices, and service. Will come back next time I'm in Vegas. The calzones are really tasty!!! All the food was good and fresh."}
{"text":"Try the shrimp corn tamales.  They are amazing!  It has a good cilantro sauce :-).  The guacamole was good too."}
{"text":"There are two ways I rate Mexican restaurants, first by their guacamole and second by their margaritas.  Both were excellent.  The guac was creamy, chunky and seasoned just right and the margarita was simple and they used real ingredients - no mix.    I had the mushroom quesadilla, which was what attracted me to the restaurant after reading another person's review below.  It was delicious!  My boyfriend and friend visiting from out of state had the fish tacos, which were also good according to them.  We all had happy, full bellies and I would definitely go back.  Their food was clean, well-seasoned and prepared well."}
{"text":"Small joint with yummy vegan eats and drinks. Good happy hour and friendly service. The decor is pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"Tried them out last evening and the food was really marginal.  Very very dry tacos, and my wife's sandwich was mostly bread; the filling was also quite dry.  And I have never eaten refried beans that are pureed?  Tasty but odd."}
{"text":"Food was great! Presentation was great. We had the Mexican Pizza (wonderful), Shrimp Tamale (out of this world) and Pig Wings (delicious). The meat market had beautiful meat to purchase.  A great find, we will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Very few local spots have impressed us like the Blind Pig. Excellent quality of food and outstanding service for a hard to beat price. Where else can you go and have dinner for 2 and a few cocktails for under $20 each. Like Cheers, \"they always know your name\". We have tried almost everything on the menu and it never disappoints. Our favorites are the stuffed burger charred to order stuffed with bacon and cheese. BEST burger in town.....hands down! Try the chicken taquitos or pork mole. Holy moly, to die for. Don't leave without trying the homemade keylime pie."}
{"text":"Fun place, great atmosphere.  Get the Green Monster drink, try the Monkey bread, and don't miss out on the Poutine (fries & gravy)!!!!  A regular for breakfast,  lunch,  and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Lobster Mac and cheese was fantastic. Large serving also. Free drink for checking in. Comfy booth with pillows."}
{"text":"Visiting from Colorado for spring training, and stopped by here two times. The food was delicious and we most likely will be stopping by again. I've had the shrimp tamale twice and loved it both times! Service was also great. Loved the outside seating area!"}
{"text":"Staying in the condos within walking distance I decided to have dinner here instead of having to brave The Strip. I might have had better luck there unfortunately. It was pretty quite on a Tuesday late night but there was one group of trust fund kids at the bar that made it their goal to own the room. Yelling like this was the coolest frat party they've ever been to. I don't want to blame the staff but I kinda do. Decide if you want your place to be a wild club or a restaurant. I could tell the other customers were not too amused with the dinner theater.     The food was okay but for the price range I expected a little more. $18 lamb chops were a little dry but the seasoning was good. Potatoes were a little over cooked but not terrible. It's not a meal I would send a postcard home about. Beer choice was okay.   The waitress was super sweet but I just don't think I would ever come back here hoping things are better the next time around. It's not the Vegas gamble I want to take."}
{"text":"Adding to my favorite mexi type restaurants!  Food was outstanding in that they use fresh and top quality ingredients, very tasty, a bit different from the norm and absolutely tasty! We shared a baked potato with chorizo and cheese for an appetizer. Admittedly, not my pick, but so glad we did! What a nice surprise. Salad was huge and tasty as well! And not drowned in heavy dressing. Had the street tacos and those were very good with a generous portion of the meat filling. Not the usual one tablespoon of meat you get in a typical street taco.  Very above average.  Planning my next visit for this Friday as there are so many items on the menu that I want to try.  Great outdoor seating as well.  Atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch.  I stop in frequently and generally get the chipotle chicken sandwich, tuna sandwich, or Caesar salad.  It's not over the top or anything, but they offer really good food for a good price, and it's fast and quick enough to get in and out and on my way.  The staff is wonderful and are always willing to substitute or make changes to dishes without a problem!   Parking is VERY limited and the dining room is on the smaller side, so be sure to get their before dining rush hours.  I would recommend it for friends, but not to plan a dinner date or anything beyond a good lunch."}
{"text":"If you haven't been then ya just gotta! This is THE most incredibly delicious food ever!!! Not your typical Mexican fare which we love, mind you. It's a small place packing a BIG wallop. Your taste buds will thank you. I'm literally moaning & groaning with every bite! We've been a number of times & truly have not had anything that wasn't memorable! If we lived closer I would be a frequent flyer for sure. The service is prompt & friendly & beer is cold! Brrrrr!! The presentation is photo worthy. Portions plentiful & while I expected to take some home, forget that! My hubby, daughter & I split 2 entrees which was more than ample. We had  the mushroom quesadillas and avocado bruschetta. The sauces are AHmazing! And they put the hotter stuff on the side for my family as I am a wimp! Charming patio to soak up the cooler temps & a mini splash pad adds just the right atmosphere considering you are in a parking lot but next to Uncle Sal's another prize winning favorite!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. Everything we ordered tasted great and the prices was all reasonable. The $$ is deceiving because its not that pricy. I got the Adobo Braised Short Ribs with house rice (+$1.00). The short ribs dish was only $10. It was so flavorful, both with a slight sweetness and spiciness. It was the perfect balance. Additionally, the short rib was tender but not overly tender that it falls apart.   My husband got the carnitas house sandwich. The cold slaw in the sandwich didn't drown out the carnitas. It complimented it perfectly. The carnitas was the center of attention.   As a starter, we got the cerviche. It's hard to get it wrong. The shrimp was fresh and the larger type. There was just a hint of spiciness.   Love this place. Too bad I'm from out of state, otherwise I'll be coming here all the time."}
{"text":"what's sad about this is that based on my standards for what this place is, i would have given it a 3. i was briefed by a friend about the downstairs and i could not wait to check it out for myself. after many experiences in plenty of crowded, sweaty club-like environments, this one just did not do for me what i wanted, and there is one reason.  the dj sucked. i know, going into a place like this, that the drinks are going to be expensive for the actual liquor to mixer ratio, that there are going to be people cruising each other all over the place, and that 21 year olds will probably be throwing up in the bathroom pretty early, but COME ON, at least let me hear my jams in full.  what kept happening is that something would play that i love to dance to in a club - jay-z, 50 cent, snoop, what have you - and suddenly 30 seconds to a minute and a half later, it would switch to something else entirely, usually in a totally different genre, usually with a bad transition. while i love eric prydz' \"call on me\", i don't want to hear it jammed in between a techno remix of \"don't stop believin\" that only the kids from the jersey shore could love, and \"gin and juice.\"   if i had a bit less blood in my alcohol system and possibly my bff partner in crime who loves to go to places like this, it probably would have been much more hilarious to me. i may try this again, hopefully i won't still feel the need to body check the dj out of the way to make sure a song plays in its entirety."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Would have given a 5 but our server who was very friendly needed a good bit more training. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!!  Service is great and don't miss out on the pork nuggets!!!  Prices are also fair.  Nice place to go for a quick delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"One of the latest restaurants to open is The Blind Pig inside Panorama Towers. You can spot the restaurant from the I-15 it is accessed on Dean Martin Drive ample parking is available out front. Inside, you're met with a deli to your right and lounge to the left. My brother and I came in to dine for lunch. You order at the counter, you're given a number and your food is brought to you over in the lounge. The Deli seemed promising, it reminded me of a petite version of those I love in San Diego and San Francisco. You feel like you're transported into a speakeasy when you step over to the lounge. There is a large bar, oversized booths and table seating.   The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entrees that include pasta, poultry or seafood. They also serve breakfast, though, I'm not sure when its available. My brother chose the Pastrami Rueben ($9.50) with coleslaw and I had the BP Porchetta sandwich with potato salad ($13.50). After a short wait, our lunch was served.  The Rueben was decent. The pastrami is sliced thin and possibly tossed on the griddle since there were crisp edges. The bread was dry, but the Russian dressing was quite good. Better than most Thousand Island dressings. The coleslaw went uneaten, it was too sweet for both of our tastes.   The Porchetta sandwich sounded great in theory, but the execution was poor. The greens were limp and slimey. The nuggets of pork belly and pork loin tumbled out from the bread with every bite. The pork loin was tender and had great flavor. I wish it were thinly sliced instead and piled high; it would make for a tasty sandwich. I enjoy pork belly when the fat is properly rendered. It was unfortunate that more than half of the nuggets were tough and filled with flubber. I found those pieces inedible. As a general rule, I do not like potato salad. Majority contain mayo and mustard; my least favorite condiments, this was no exception. I'd prefer alternate options to potato salad and cole slaw since both contain mayonnaise. My sandwich and iced tea was $18. I left hungry. Needless to say, I won't be rushing back to The Blind Pig, but I may return to try other menu items because the location makes it a very convenient lunch option."}
{"text":"OK Mexican food served on a pleasant patio. Average margarita. Great guacamole. Very good, rich and creamy mushroom quesadilla. OK Oysters Rockefeller - the sauce was a little overpowering."}
{"text":"So far the best kept secret in Las Vegas the service, food, and the feeling that they can't do enough to make you feel at home !! The smoothies are just amazing and meals of our party of 5 were excellent!!! Ask for Jos√© our waiter he adds a to a great experience!!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just down the street from our condo, but we had never tried it until tonight.  We were greeted warmly when we came in, and told to sit where we liked.  The service was very good, as were the recommendations from our server.  We had the chips and guacamole/salsa for $6 to start, and then I had the wild mushroom quesadilla ($10), while my husband had a combination of 3 soft shell tacos (short rib and another kind, $8).  Both meals were delicious, and the quesadilla was so huge, I'll be having the rest for lunch tomorrow! The Arizona Cardinals game was on, which made for a lively atmosphere.   Beer was very reasonably priced, and we'd be drinking if we hadn't come from jogging!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to this place wish I could turn back time our female server was a snob food not so Mexican"}
{"text":"Come here often after sporting events. Good casual place, quality burgers, pizza, and beer. The wedge salad is a favorite (get the dressing on the side if you want to control how much)."}
{"text":"Wow, biggest, most flavorful, beef burrito I've ever had. Small hole in the wall place with great service. Worth finding it though. I highly recommend it. I'll be back next time I'm here."}
{"text":"The shrimp tamales were amazing! Nice outside patio with water fountain. Chips, guacamole, and salsa were awesome too! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review...Not sure why there have been recent bad reviews. My service and food have been on point every time I eat here. Which is about once a week! Pricing is great, 3 tacos $8. Short rib tacos are a must. Stop in and make your own judgement.. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, big portions, super reasonable prices, and the friendliest service you could hope for.  I would absolutely suggest this spot for anyone in the Phoenix area looking for a casual, low-key, friendly night out.  Located in an unprepossessing shopping complex, this spot is just the kind of hidden gem that is perfect for a bite and a quiet evening just when you need it most.  Plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This is my first one star review. If I could leave no stars, I would. I have eaten here before and thought the food was great. Today, I went with four coworkers for lunch. We waited over 45 minutes for our food with not a word from our server. There were only a few other tables so it's not like they were swamped. When the food arrived, one of the dishes was made wrong. We were already late back to work so we had them take it off the bill as it was untouched. The rest of us proceeded to eat our food. It was delicious, although untimely, until my boss CHOMPED ON A PIECE OF GLASS in his sandwich. The rest of us stopped eating, and when we told the employees, we barely got an apology and had to ask twice for them to waive our bill. This was literally the worst restaurant experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"I live at Panorama and the arrival of Blind Pig has been a godsend. Only wish they were open for late night dining. Fortunately, Tommy Rockers can satisfy on a pinch.  Blind Pig is excellent. They have an incredible beer selection and a few cocktails that aren't half bad. I personally recommend the Bad Hair Day.  The food is certainly the shining star though. This is the first place I've found in Vegas that is serving up a solid Poutine and if you don't know what that is, then I suggest you get down here and find out.  Anything with the Italian sausage is a home run as well. Get down here!"}
{"text":"Best meal we've had on our trip to Vegas. Everything that our table ordered was super good. I halved the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese and BP burger and the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese is the best mac and cheese I've ever had and the burger was soo juicy and didn't need anything extra added to it. This is definitely a place we'll continue to go to when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"First time trying you out this morning and I was impressed. Service was prompt, friendly, and on top of it, facility was cleaner than I could imagine, my fresh pressed veggie juice was delicious, full of flavor, and our meals arrived quickly, just the right temperature, and delicious.. i'm sorry I am just now discovering this place.. Really enjoyed it.. the ambiance, environment, its just a great place for any meal, any time of day, and the food caters to my healthy needs.. thank you for having a variety of juices, coffees, and smoothies to select from.. often times it's just coffee & water but I was so thankful to see other alternatives on your menu.. thank you! will return"}
{"text":"Came back again and drink weree fucking terrible, server wasnt happy dont know if she purposely made it shitty but yeah pissed. Mango madness taste like orange peels"}
{"text":"Stopped-in with two co-workers based upon yelp review.  When we walked in we thought we had made a mistake.  We tried the food and discovered this place is simply awesome.  Staff was extremely friendly, excellent food, great prices.  I hope they open one in So. California."}
{"text":"We ordered $50 worth of take out. 12 year locals and will never go back. Stood at reception for 17 minutes and not a sole checked on us. Thanks for the waste of gas driving to you. We are no longer patronizing your establishment or referring the hundreds of people to your restaurant. Disgusting."}
{"text":"McDonald's with a valet.  This used to be one of my favorite food places with some of my favorite food. Recently it seems to have been sold and converted to an italian joint with ordinary, bland and forgettable food. I can't find anything here worth coming for, while even their Caesar salad tastes bland with ordinary dressing like you can get at a McDonald's. Then they put a valet outside to make it more difficult to easily get in and out, I guess pretending to be some type of luxury restaurant. The only decent dish they have is a so-so copy of the original BP burger, now with a cheap tasting pickle. The staff is trying their best, but I almost feel sorry they have to work in this cheapened fake place. I'm missing all the food the real Blind Pig offered."}
{"text":"Great place for stiff drinks and yummy food! I love their pastas... I could have their clam linguine everyday! Plus, you can't beat the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Now this place is awesome.  The manager is such a great and happy man who is eager to make sure you get whatever you would like.  I asked him a question about his special and he instantly offered to make it spicy for me and add anything else that I would like to the dish.  He speaks with passion about food and the menu and you can genuinely tell that he loves his job.    Every time we have gone the food has been consistently awesome and it's fresh.   I think it's quality food at a very reasonable price.   I don't think that I've ever finished my meal there and always take the rest home for later.   This is a great little place to check out."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is attentive and kind - especially when dealing with the constant requests of drink refills for two young children.    The menu is limited yet everything is fresh and presented well. The outdoor patio seating by the fountain was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Burger is, hands down, one of the top in LV! And I'm somewhat of a burger connoisseur.   Style and design were great! I love the brick walls, art, pigs, color palette, etc.  Light too bright over booths, felt very cafeteria-ish. I would dim those down some. Tables at the booths were a little small also. My back started hurting because I couldn't sit all the way back and eat over the table. I was hunched over most of the time.  Service is so-so. A little more education on the menu items and customer service would do some wonders.   All in all, it's worth the trip to try the burger :)"}
{"text":"The Blind Pig is incredible and easily one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. It is very difficult to find GOOD, authentic Al Pastor tacos outside of some special places in California, but The Blind Pig makes an Al Pastor taco that is second to none. Highly recommended. Great to pair with one of their delicious Paloma drinks!"}
{"text":"The ambience is Old Vegas. Lots of TVs to watch sports. Sports book machine on the premises. Incredible food. The Calamari is to die for. Great for lunch or dinner or happy hoodie or late night. The staff is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you.  This is not a barbecue joint from Texas.  They have a great variety of specials that are very unique.  I had the shrimp tamale and a Paloma Fresca\"tequila with fresh grapefruit\" great flavor and just the right kick! We had the chips and salsa, fresh guacamole and salsa would be enough to make a grown man cry with joy!"}
{"text":"Service was great , food was great. I loved the shrimp and corn tamale dish!  Patio is fine, but sits on walkway next to parking lot of a mini mall."}
{"text":"My work partners and I stumbled on this place for breakfast. Staff was great, friendly, food decent, price wasn't bad at all. We enjoyed this place so much we returned the same day for dinner and a drink. Again, a different shift was working but we were met with friendly staff and the food was just as good as expected. I will definitely make this a stop when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is a cute little hole in the wall with a funny name that doesn't fit it Mexican cuisine. Staff was very friendly & service was quick. The food was pretty tasty but we had to buy chips & salsa as it didn't come complimentary like with other Mexican restaurants. The chips were stale & tasted like they came from a bag vs fresh or homemade. For our main meal I had the special, chicken enchiladas with red sauce on the side (which I'm glad I did cause it was kinda grainy; definitely bean based which I didn't care for). It was served with their house rice which had an interesting blend of pineapple, cilantro & other spices. It was AMAZING; best rice I've ever tasted! However their guacamole was awful; very acidic tasting, to the point lemon / lime juice overpowered the avocado ruining the entire dish. Our server quickly took it away when we complained however. My boyfriend had the carne asada tacos which were flavorful but extremely tiny. He also had the rice & enjoyed it immensely. Overall this restaurant was good with a few minor flaws. I'd come here again & try DQ offer items on the menu. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Pleasantly surprised!!  First time here.   We were uncertain what to order.  Owner suggested he could make us each      a special enchilada of our choice.     Very good!!  I especially loved the bean dip appetizer and their green mild salsa!!  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"OMG - if you are from Scottsdale or visiting, find this place!  I had spare ribs and my wife had shrimp tamale. Both great!!!  Appetizer of chips and guacamole. Also great. I'm a believer. Gotta try this place."}
{"text":"New owners, so sad. I have been a faithful customer of the Blind pig for many years. The food has always been superb and the service impeccable. Over the past several visits I have noticed a marked decline in the quality of food, the serving sizes, and most importantly the service. Tonight I tried to order food for takeout at 8:30 and they told me they decided to close early because it was a slow night and would only accept cash. I know the owners and give them a call just to make sure they were OK with this type of customer service only to be informed that it is no longer owned by Sally. I met the new owner when I came to pick up my order and remarked on my concerns with the change in the quality of food and service and she was absolutely Uconcerned with my dissatisfaction. It's sad but hopefully they will figure out that the reason this restaurant was so successful is because of their attention to detail and the new owners will revert back to proven tradition. For now. Stay away."}
{"text":"Haven't been to The Blind Pig in a while, but glad to see the high rating. Well deserved! Gotta get back there SOON."}
{"text":"I had tried coming here last Wednesday night but there weren't any parking spaces. My husband was playing in a WSOP tournament at the RIO and was on a dinner break. I saw that they had poutine and I had tried it once before at the Pig and the Pickle in Concord,CA and loved it and now whenever I see it on a menu, I have to try it. I'm so glad we had time to come back today and try this place. There was plenty of parking this time around, early Sunday morning. Walked in and immediately noticed the deep booths available and loved the nice touch of the added comfy pillows.  Loved the lighting, dark walls, pig heads and pig paintings. It all worked quite well together.  I didn't know what to expect when yelp said free drink just for checking in. Free drink ended up including any cocktail, coffee or smoothie. It being still early I went for the very berry smoothie. What a deal!  Previous reviews suggested trying the pork bites. I was conflicted. But, tasty pork won out over fries with cheese and gravy.   It didn't disappoint. Nice, fatty, fried pork pieces in a slightly spicy sweet sauce paired nicely with the creamy dipping sauce. The flavors and textures melded well together - it truly was a taste of heaven in my mouth. Service was spot on.  I will definitely come back and try the poutine next time."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy myself here. The bartenders are fun and the crowd is typically pretty fun as well. Good for both dancing and sitting at the bar.  We were here recently for our Senior week and there were pretty awesome drink specials--and the drinks weren't lacking anything due to the price! I was definitely impressed.  I would recommend you give The Blind Pig a try, and if you don't like it, this area is perfect for bar hopping."}
{"text":"Drink service here, one late Friday evening was good enough. I'll need to come back and try more food as I really only tried the french fries (we had eaten before). When we were there, we were the largest group, taking up a long table right when you walk in, with other patrons in a couple other booths and at the bar.   The large group size (10) might have contributed to a small mix-up on drink orders, but it wasn't something that couldn't easily be fixed. Also, I don't know if it's the late-night ambiance but it was suuuuuper dark in there. Like hard to read the menu dark. Like I said, I'll have to come back for a proper meal, but it was a good enough place to grab a drink with friends."}
{"text":"My first time coming was very pleasant I enjoy this restaurant. It was New Year's Day 1/1/2018. The ambiance is a warmth home feeling. Food was delicious. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about what dishes she recommends."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Had pig wings (awesome), short ribs and short rib tacos (both excellent). Good service on a beautiful day sitting outside."}
{"text":"Great experience! We wanted authentic Mexican food and there is quite a lot to choose from in Arizona. The Blind Pig happened to be only a couple miles from where we were staying so we decided to try it out. They have a nice sized patio in front. There were quite a few people waiting to sit outside so we decided to just sit inside so we could get faster service.   The server was excellent. He did tell us that they were short one person that night and kept apologizing but the service was still excellent! He thought we waited too long for our food so he bought us a round of drinks. Can't get better than that!  We also loved how you could do tacos ala carte...Most places you have to get the same kind because the dish comes with 2 or 3 but here you can order as many different kinds as you want!   If we had stayed longer we would've gone back one last time."}
{"text":"Came in with no expectations other than a great name. Met by a smile and hello.  Great choice of seats. Comfy. We were greeted by a wonderful server. Shay  who guided us through the menu. And the bar menu, which is extensive.  The Steak Pizzaola is the best un- ordinary dish. Try it if you like gravy and steak! Red sauce.  Shay was friendly. Informative and a true delight wait person. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We found this place at random. My wife and I loved it. The Avacado bruschetta, mahi tacos and the corn and shrimp tamale all fabulous. We will be returning frequently."}
{"text":"Do not leave Phoenix area (Scottsdale) without eating here. Get the pork wing (rib), guacamole appetizer, shrimp tamale (melt in mouth) and al pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more unique finds in the Vegas area. Conveniently located off the Strip, but still within an Uber/Lyft ride, this small upbeat restaurant feature a large bar area with comfortable seating.   Came in during the dinner rush for a couple drinks and appetizers and meals to go. Bartender was super nice and gave enough to talk/chat with company and still look through the menu. Wasn't too thrilled that the draft selection didn't go past 3, but the beers were good.   Minus 2 stars for the lack of good parking and that it always seems crowded even when there isn't that many people there. It seems to get real loud even when there isn't much chatter going on or the TV volume isn't even that high.  The food is good, I ordered the chicken marsala with french fries (hormonal cravings) and my boyfriend got a calzone. The chicken marsala was good, the sauce was rich and it went really well with the fries (I was probably craving poutine which is why I enjoyed this pair). My boyfriend did enjoy his calzone, he didn't have much to say about it other than it did its job to quell hunger."}
{"text":"This little piggy loved dinner at that Little Piggy. Started with Pork Nugget,  I don't love Watermelon which was in sauce but cut it off and found it to be delightful.   Had lobster mac and cheese which was tasty yet shy on the lobster and my husband really enjoyed his Reuben. Both our special drinks were very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Scottsdale!  I get nothing but great quality food and service every time.  A somewhat hidden gem...get the al pastor burrito 5 stars"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. Great place with really good food. Al pastor tacos are the bomb. Both times we started with the nachos and they are my favorite of any restaurant nachos. The crab stack is perfect for a hot day.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Absolute ripoff.  It's called blind pig because the waitresses and cooks are probably blind on the prices they quote on the menu and what ends up on the receipt.  They quote you a pizza for $14.99, then the bill comes to $27, they charge $1.50 for green peppers and each other topics. Then for deep dish style they charge extra $7.50 without telling you upfront.    My waitress forgot the ranch dressing, then another waitress who brought me the pizza, completely disappeared after I asked her for ranch also.  I waited 25 min for a low grade pizza which didn't even have thoroughly cooked tomatoes and green peppers, just a ton of melted mozzarella and an average dough.   It doesn't end there, they kept changing the games on Tv with a loud  treble sound that no seemed to care about.   Let me give all restaurant owners a little tip about customer service and finance, because there are a lot of trust fund babies that have no idea how businesses are ran.  If you provide a terrible service, then a loyal customer such as myself will never step foot here Again , which costs you $300-400 of lost sales a year, including any additional lost business from people who will change their mind after reading this Yelp review.   If you have unhappy workers or workers who smoke too much pot and forget to bring ranch or whatever else is asked, then you might want to ask yourself how long you will stay in business.  The food is mediocre at best, but for Vegas standards there are way better places for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Went bicycling with a friend and stopped at this restaurant.  The atmosphere on the patio was relaxing.  The food was incredible and probably the best I have had in a while!  The carne asada tacos were amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been there for lunch twice in two Weeks. We are never disappointed . Shrimp & corn tamale is a specialty. My friend loves it so much he has to force himself to try other menu items for variety. Adobo short ribs are tender and yummy over the house rice. They didn't skimp on the 'shrooms in their Mushroom quesadilla. It was a portion which satisfied my husband. I knew the torta would have more bread than I wanted but the presentation and taste were worthy of ordering again on another visit. Salsas served with chips were tasty; the red had just the right heat. They are located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. we go at off peak times to be sure to get a patio seat."}
{"text":"A very weird place indeed. Sports bar upstairs with live music and your average sports bar look and feel. Then you walk downstairs into their dungeon, which is basically a techno club, and an entirely different bar altogether. I would have rather been upstairs, but the crowd that I was with preferred the dungeon. The drinks were cheap, which was necessary to drown out the shitty music. Definitely not my thing, but my friends were having a good time with it."}
{"text":"Salad with a burger was unexpected. Thought would come with fries. No condiments such as ketchup or mustard. Love the food but slightly disappointed..."}
{"text":"Wasn't good service, my girlfriends and I were the only ones in there. Disappointed with the food. Way too expensive for the amount or quality"}
{"text":"Everything was so good! We trusted our yelp users and they didn't prove us wrong. The shrimp and corn tamale was to die for!"}
{"text":"It is definitely the warehouse crowd, which either goes 6-7 years younger than me, or 10-12  years older than me.   The warehouse district seems to be perfect for college kids looking to \"hook-up\" and cougars/single men in their 40's just divorced who are heading into the city  for their biannual mandates.   Upstairs is for middle aged yuppies rocking out to 80's cover bands. Downstairs is for 21 year olds who are still excited to be able to drink and dance outside of their friend's apartments."}
{"text":"Happened upon this establishment while out and about in Scottsdale. The food and drinks were excellent.  Try the chicken taquitos...you won't be dissappointed.  Sat at the bar, our bartender Izzy was attentive and personable without being overbearing. If you are in the area stop on in, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I called in an order and they told me it would be 40 minutes for 3 short rib tacos which was fine, I showed up to pick it up 40 minutes later and they weren't ready. OVER 30 minutes AFTER THAT I am still waiting. For 3 effing tacos. 3 TACOS! Does that take more than 30 seconds to put together? ZERO STARS!!!!!!! So bad, just so so so bad to make people stand around awkwardly in your restaurant waiting for food."}
{"text":"A lot of ballers go to eat here. Lots of nice cars outside. Sat outside on a nice day for lunch. I'd say the service could've been a lot better. I had no water refills. I feel like since I was the only one eating outside that the server forgot about me.  The fries are really good. The lobster and shrimp mac were the business."}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates. Paid for a coke, didnt get one. Asked for a side of mayo, didnt get one. The pretzels were tough and the cheese sauce was watery. I expected more for the price."}
{"text":"The appetizers were the best part. Queso, guac, salsa, and nachos. The entrees were just ok. A couple in our group were disappointed, especially with the Mexican pizza. We made a reservation for 6 and sat on the patio, which was nice. It did take a while to get our food, but the waitress updated us regularly.  I'd go back just because the prices are great for a Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Pig wings are amazing, huge oysters on the half shell, and the avocado bruschetta is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is still a five star establishment for me. Great service and really good food. You can enjoy your time here without breaking the bank too! We typically sit at the bar with Liz, Raul and Brenda. They also make some great daily specials and have a large patio for our amazing wether!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Super friendly both the bar manager and bartender. We are staying at Veer Towers and found it while out exploring the area. The meatballs are excellent big serving for a great price!"}
{"text":"New managment sent the place from a nice gastropub to a PT's/Denny's style cheap eatery.  Laminated menus, plastic cups, cheap food. So sad, this place was a nice place for locals."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Don't pay twice as much for inferior food at the theme restaurants on the strip. This is a quality place. The nuggets were awesome!"}
{"text":"When my friend invited me to The Blind Pig, I was obsessed with the name right away. That's so different, let's go! When we walked in, I immediately liked the feel. This restaurant is located in the bottom level of Panorama Towers and has a view of the strip. The small room is dimly lit and there are pig decorations everywhere. Not tacky pigs but cool pigs, if that can be possible.   Since there were three of us, we ordered a couple things to share. We started with Poutine and it was very good. I only had it one other time, in Canada and surprisingly this was way better! My friends liked the Pork Belly Nuggets but they weren't my favorite. I think pork belly is hit or miss because sometimes it is too fatty.  I shared the Speakeasy Steak Sandwich with my friend and it was delicious!! Their bread is super thick and amazing. I asked for extra mayo of course because that's how I like my cheesesteaks.   Overall, I think this is a cute place to hang out with friends. They had drink specials but I didn't pay attention since I don't drink but my friends seemed excited about them. There was only a couple people there for most of the time we were eating but a group came in as we were leaving. On the way out we checked out the store next door. Super cute. I think I want to live in Panorama Towers now!"}
{"text":"Food is much improved over the last year, service still very poor.  In my last two visits, it took three times to get water (com on, were in a desert!!), second time; tonight....no bread after asking three yes 3 servers!.  Reason they told me?  Must be baking it?  Holy spin mister!  No smiles behind the bar just snarls, owner never greets folks, just smokes cigarettes outside and looks grumpy too....Overall very sad, because when you live in the towers next to it, you would like to WANT to go there not HAVE to because your hungry...sad."}
{"text":"We came her for a late night bite.  I came here previously when it was under different ownership. And prices were a little better   We got a chipped salad sub articles in place of salami. We had wanted Acavedo but the restaurant was out.  The salad was delicious. My wife thought it had too much cheese and not enough veggies which I did of agree with but it was still really good. The server asked us if we wanted extra dressing but the salad was already drenched in dressing.    We got a large cheese pizza which was $17.99 which I think is a bit pricey for a cheese pizza.   Our server recommended extra sauce which we asked for. The sauce was still not enough and the little sauce we got had zero flavor. Maybe there wasn't enough sauce to actually taste it. The cheese was sparse and the entire pizza was over cooked.  I prefer a pizza with a crispy crust. I didn't ask for this pizza to be well done but it was well done. To the point that the crust had a chat and the cheese was dried out and didn't have its cheesy pull anymore.  I asked the server for a extra side of sauce and maybe some garlic powder.  I got marinara and garlic salt. The server tried. But the marinara sauce was not a good sub for pizza sauce.  I didn't like its flavor and the garlic salt which I blindly put on my slice ruined it. Why would you give me garlic salt?    The service was great overall. Very fast and attentive. The sale is get again. We went because we were craving pizza but the pizza really was not very good at all.   They have outside seating and unfortunately the sound of the freeway really ruins it."}
{"text":"I have wrote a review recently on the Blind Pig with such promise to its new ownership and renovations, but I must say its awful. This place used to be wonderful, and it's gone straight to the gutter. I miss the market terribly and so do other residents for the Panorama. The food has tasted \"cheaper\" and the service has fallen greatly. Not to mention their new management is rude and doesn't look out for their workers. I have seen their staff eating on the floors or under the stairwell of the garage, that's ridiculous! One employee told me that \"it's either here or the floor in the kitchen.\" Being a bar owner myself I'm appalled at this new ownership. It's always a shame when something good goes sour. As the saying goes, it it's not broke don't fix it.  As a result, I will never be returning to The Blind Pig and will take the short trip down the street to Johnny Rockers for now on. This place might as well just name to the Pig because that's what they are. You have lost your loyal customer for over 2 years."}
{"text":"Skip the mediocre buffet breakfasts at the hotels, and check this place out.  Best breakfast potatoes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great local place with really good food.  I would definitely recommend trying the nachos and Mac n cheese, they are both phenomenal."}
{"text":"On my last visit to Vegas I stopped in for a drink and then came back again for the food and again with a co-worker. This place is great! The ambiance is modern and relaxed, the staff is great, the drinks are amazing, and the food is delicious. Coming from the strip, the value for the price is excellent. I mean, if you want ridiculous value then go to Taco y Taco, but if you want value for high quality food then this place has that. My favorite dish is the shrimp and lobster mac 'n cheese, which is a full meal. On my third visit I had the pizza with the sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms (I don't recall the name) and it was very good. I see other reviews about the margarita pizza and I've heard the same, so I'm sure they'll fix it. They are new, so when you stop in ask, since they're in improvement mode. I don't even think they've had their grand opening yet. The mixed drinks are high quality and the bottled beer selection is a great mix of craft and specialty beers along with a few go-to beers if you're not a beer person. My advice, go there now; it's only a matter of time before you'll need to make a reservation or wait in line. I'll definitely go back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Food was really good and service staff was fun and attentive. I had the cheese wedges and the Stromboli."}
{"text":"After biting into my pork sandwich I was greeted by a gnarly hunk of BONE; I let the my waitress know. her response was not sympathetic and she shrugged it off by letting me know that it happens frequently and in a variety of their meats. Their guacamole was great, but the rest of the food was lackluster and missed the target."}
{"text":"Friend brought us to this place to try out. We walked in and was not acknowledged, we sat down at our own volition after ten minutes of waiting. Five or so minutes later, what seemed to be the busser, came and took our drink order, a few beers, water, and a tea. Waitress came by, seven minutes later, asked if we needed drinks, we said we orderd some, the tea and water already being out, the beers being completely forgotten about. Had to retell what the beers were, they came out eight minutes later. The place was NOT busy, three other tables, one being a table of eight. Waitress came back after another six minutes asked if we were ready, we responded with \"yes\" she walked away, I got her attention again before she got too far, we placed orders. Food came out promptly, eight minutes, two of our four ordered burgers, no condements were offered we had to flag down the bartender to get some as our waitress was no where to be found. Food was good, props to the kitchen. Drinks were dry and no one came by, we didnt know what the waitress was doing. Twenty three minutes later the busser came by and refilled the water and tea, no mention of the beers to be had. Seventeen minutes later, the busser came and cleared the table, we had just finished eating. Thirty seven minutes later the waitress came by to see if we needed anything, we asked for a check, four minutes later we got it. One of our group felt bad that she didnt put the two beers we had on the check so when she came back six minutes later told her, she said, \"What beers did you have?\" Responded with one of their ambers and a Firestone, she goes \"Oh\". Leaves comes back two minutes later with, \"So you didn't get the beers?\", we said, \"No we got them, they just were not charged to the bill.\" Responding, \"Okay let me add them.\" My thought when she didnt add them was maybe it was a nice comp for the realization of poor service, but this statement proves not. Comes back four minutes later again with the final bill charged and walks away, full meal finally finished. No thank you or come again, mind you we were not rude by any means, and actually were curious if we had done something to get the service we got. One hundred and thirty three minutes for a meal. Mind you the time with friends was nice, food was good, service was atrocious. I was let down by all the reviews. I will not be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Seriously? I'm not even sure where to begin. The menu has a weird mix of twists on Mexican favorites, Italian food and macaroni and cheese. Their prized dish, the shrimp tamale, is really 3 small, week-old shrimp, served over an overly sweet polenta mixture. We finished about 3 bites.   Who serves guacamole in a coconut shell?  The drinks were another low point. Served in soft drink style glassware my martini became some mix that was more like a margarita, and the \"Mexican mule\" was an over-sold limeade.   The service was terrible, and slow. One of our party requested hot water to calm her stomach and they literally said that they had NO HOT WATER in the whole restaurant. I question, then, how they wash their hands or make their coffee. The waitress was super snotty and not at all fun or friendly.   They charged a 19% gratuity on our $100 bill for 6. I'm a big tipper but that would be a bit presumptuous even at a fine dining establishment. Clearly they get you because they know you wouldn't tip otherwise.   Pass, pass, pass...drive a bit further west and go to barrio urbano or another joint near camelback. This place is no good, at all..."}
{"text":"The evening bartender should not be in the service industry, not personable at all. The food is okay for lunch, just don't sit at the bar, and it is a shame, because it is a nice bar, and could probably be busier with a better bartender, I gave it another try after the first time was unfriendly, and the friends I brought the second time mentioned the bartender was not friendly when I asked how they liked it."}
{"text":"Great food for lunch. Pig wings meaty and decent sized. Jalape√±o ranch dressing reminded me of Texas. The pickled vegetables included as part of pig wings should be added to the menu as a side salad. Day at the bar and I'll definitely be back for dinner. Decent wine selection including a bottle of wild hog that I've had before and never seen at a smaller restaurant."}
{"text":"What a gem! It was a little hidden but definitely worth the find! I loved the food and the look of the place! Try their chicken Parm sandwich!"}
{"text":"They had great, fresh Mexican food and good prices. Service was pretty slow the time i was there for dinner, though."}
{"text":"Been here several times as its down the street from my house and really wanted to give 4 stars BUT the Salsa is not good at all--wayyy too salty and no distinct flavor other than salt. The red and green are both not good. This should be an easy fix. If they fix this alone I'd give them 4 stars.  Guacamole is great. Service is decent.  Fish tacos are outstanding! The drunk/drowned torta sandwich is really good but the dipping sauce could use some more flavor. It's oddly quite a bit like the way too salty salsa.  My girlfriend recently was here and they screwed up her order, did not make the burrito as ordered then they offered beans that were cold. Strange as we've had good experiences before."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Thanks once again to Yelp. Another good hole in the wall restaurant. The service was a little lacking but it could have been an off day for the server."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp while looking for places to try on our mini-vacation up in Scottsdale this past weekend and this came up rated really well so we went. The place looks nice and has a great patio area (which was full so we had to sit inside). We ordered the Queso Fundido to start and it was good, I really like the flavor their beans have, but i would've liked more cheese because there was only a tiny blob in the middle. I ordered the chicken taco plate with a side of their House Rice. The chicken was dry and flavorless and the salsas weren't the best either. The guacamole was average, I've had better, I've had worse. The rice it was great but then as I started eating it, the cumin flavor overpowered everything else! My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken torta which was \"really good\" I don't know because he wouldn't let me try it, but it looked very appealing. It came with a slaw salad and I did try that and wasn't impressed it was basically cut cucumber, radishes, and carrots in oil and pepper.Another thing is that they do have a lot of regulars (our server knew almost everyone's name) but in turn kind of ignored us Overall this place was OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Adobo short rib tacos are da bomb and the drinks are strong ;)"}
{"text":"Posh, yet convenient place to grab, eat, or drink. Priced for clientele who live in the luxury condos nearby, but quality is not bad.  They should replace the oval white plates. It's hard to rest forks and knives, easy to slip and fall off."}
{"text":"Great place and amazing service. I've tried several items on the menu and all delicious. I always come back to the Kale & Greens salad and add blackened salmon."}
{"text":"We are locals have heard of blind pig for a bit finally decided to order two burgers the meatlovers pizza and chicken fingers from uber eats. Unreal. Food was unbelievable! Will order again soon!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once was for the tail end of a band on their first floor, and once for their Thursday comedy night. I haven't had their food, so no comments on that.  The band was fun - admittedly, it was the end of the night so I was feeling great, but they were just on a 3 or 4 foot high stage at the front of the bar, right when you walk in. They had a decent crowd, and it was an alright time - although honestly I don't even think I bought a drink.  Coming in sober on comedy night was then a bit eye opening - this bar is a dive bar, and not in the appealing hole-in-the-wall-where-you-still-have-a-great-time way, but in the wow-is-that-sanitary? way. Comedy night is held downstairs, in this dark, old basement area. Yes, drinks are cheap, but the place is pretty gross looking, and the comedy (spoiler alert) is NOT very funny. The crowd is also really small (say 10 or fewer people).   Eh. Not going back."}
{"text":"I have no complaints here.  One of the best chicken caesar salads I have ever had. Chocolate Hazelnut Verene desert is chocolate mousse goodness, I might even see if I can order it without hazelnut.  Randi-lynne the waitress is amazingly awesome and funny along with Bartender Brittany super cool."}
{"text":"NOTE: If you are planning to visit, be aware that this establishment is under new management with a new menu that has done away with many of the dishes other reviews praise (lobster mac and cheese, poutine, pork nuggets). I also didn't see the pastry case or \"pantry\" shop area earlier reviews mention. I suggest focusing on the most recent reviews.  Came in for a weekday lunch with Bethany E. I dig the masculine lounge feel of the place and like that we were able to snag a cozy booth for our visit. Staff were attentive and the food was okay. Menu is still several pages but what we ordered didn't wow- spinach artichoke dip was thin but tasty, and better with the bread basket than the tortilla chips, but neither of us finished our sandwiches. My eggplant parm was okay, but a little boring. Side salad was just mixed greens and Italian dressing, but it was a good dressing with fresh oregano.   I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back, but I do hope this spot finds it's niche.  Nothing was actually bad, but it was very average. They either need to bring back the items that previous customers loved, or redo the menu to focus on better execution.  PET PEEVE: The parking lot is small, and they have the majority of spaces blocked off for valet. If I wasn't meeting someone here that would have turned me off enough to dine elsewhere. It's completely unnecessary, especially for weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I've been really looking forward to trying out The Blind Pig, and I'm glad I did.  I came in here with a friend one afternoon for lunch, and there was barely anyone there.    The inside feels more like a bar than anything else, with TVs, bar stools, and a friendly staff.  They have a beautiful patio for when the weather is nice.  Both my friend and I got tacos and really enjoyed them.  I got the Short Rib Tacos, and for the price, I was amazed.    I think this is a great choice for a cheap lunch, especially when you can sit outside. Nothing is more than around $12 or $13, and for the area, that's rare.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went with a large party and I know our server probably thought we were difficult but she handled it like a champ. The food was amazing, I had the grilled ciabatta and my friend had the Reuben which we shared and let me tell you they did not disappoint, I had to request that the food be taken away lest I end up in a food coma! Definitely worth the trip and the time, I am so happy I went."}
{"text":"The blind pig, well I went in blind despite the yelp reviews. Yelp reviews looked amazing, pics looked good, but atmosphere and food missed the mark. Service was good which is why the 1 star otherwise it would be one! Order the nachos, salsa was good but meat and cheese were cold. We were hungry so at it anyway. I was excited about the tamale but it was not good, small and expensive. 12.00 for one tamale that was VERY small!!! Then there was my brother who is in town with us. He loves tacos and order 3 different kinds. Chicken was dry and cold according to him, and the beef was cold and not good. Again being hungry and not one to complain he ate them and said something to us in the car.  The mahi taco was good he stated. So you might try that if you dare to go here!! My fianc√© got a pambazo! She said it was good I wouldn't try it and even though she loved that she agreed she would probably not go out of her way to come here. Also seating was very poor we were packed in tighter than sardines at a high top. This is a very bar styled atmosphere and cramped seating was uncomfortable and disruptive to the meal.  Update: we are all in the bathroom the next morning!! DO NOT GO!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Joseph I don't agree! Try the mushroom quesadilla. It is outstanding and more than an ample portion. Hands down a favorite spot! The guacamole is excellent too as is the shrimp tamale."}
{"text":"Although I do not write a lot of Yelp reviews I would consider myself a giant foodie.  I love trying new and different places and once I am hooked I am a customer for life.   My 3 star review for The Blind Pig has nothing to do with their quality of food but rather one specific thing regarding their service.   Let me be clear that the food is amazing and delicious and savory and very different from other Mexican places.  You can't go wrong with almost anything on their menu.  My issue is that the only time I go here is with a few co-workers or clients as it is close to my office. And the last few times I have gone the restaurant refuses to split checks and says that they are not able to do so.  What restaurant does that? Why aren't you able to split checks? Why are you refusing to do so? If you have a crowd of 5-6 co-workers eating lunch there you are putting one of them in a very uncomfortable position in paying for everyone and than attempting to collect reimbursements later.  Very inconvenient and disappointing. Until this process is changed I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Somebody get that pig some glasses!   I met a friend here for lunch at a new place for both of us. You can't miss it off of Dean Martin Drive.  There doesn't seem to be much parking as most of the spaces directly in front were roped off for valet.  There is plenty of seating on both sides of the restaurant.  The booths are very comfy accented with pillows.   We decided to start with the Spinach & Artichoke dip.  For me it was too watery.  It was almost as if the artichokes were from a can and they didn't drain the excess.  I really enjoy my dips to be more creamy.  The have a great bread basket so I would suggest using that bread instead of the tortilla chips that come with it.  I ordered the Philly with fries.  The sandwich had a good flavor.  Wonderful amount of meat and veggies packed in.  The bread used was really good as well.  A little crisp on the outside with a soft center.  The fries were just ok but could have been cooked a little longer.  If you're in the area it's an ok lunch stop but I wouldn't drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem  in Las Vegas. Good food, great staff and not crowded with smoke.  Brandi are waitress could not have done more to make us feel welcome and appreciated."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Ordered the chips and salsa ($4) and was not disappointed. Chips were light and crisp; both salsas were delicious. Mahi tacos ($8) were phenomenal and the portion size was impressive, especially for the low price. Small grilled cubes of fish were juicy but not greasy and so flavorful I didn't even add any of the sauce that came on the side.  The mahi was balanced with crunchy cabbage, but I nixed the red onion, which I think would have overpowered the other flavors.   The food came out in record time and service was impeccable. My only disappointment was that they have 20oz bottles of soda rather than fountain soda."}
{"text":"Thank goodness that delicious places are popping up nearby! We LOVE this place. The beef burrito is delicious, and my husband loves the braised pork taco. They are friendly, delicious, and worth trying again and again. I am confused about the reviewers who gave less than four or five stars. The service is outstanding and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Walking its a bit dark and quiet, didn't see a host welcoming customers and so I wasn't sure where to sit, was a bit strange. After a few mins i noticed  that the music it was playing wasn't latin music as most of Mexican restaurants, not very traditional mexican place, It was small (but cozy) lounge with gourmet Mexican food.   I ordered  just an appetizer avocado bruschetta and a glass of pinot griot , the avocado bruschetta was good but the lemon was overwhelming left me with that bitterness taste in my mouth, my advice - adding a bit of mango and going easy on the lemon.   What i liked the most was the smell of other customers dishes and their reaction while tasting the food..  Heard a lot of  \" oh wow this is delicious\"  Overall it was very pleasant, servers where nice and attentive. My favorite spot was the patio.. Just sitting by the fountain. I am looking forward to coming back and ordering other dishes off their menu. I will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Showed up at about 9:30pm on a Friday night. The inside room was 100% full and the outside was about 30% full. Stood outside. Nobody came and acknowledged me. Stood inside the doorway. Nobody acknowledged me. Stood at the bar. Nobody acknowledged me. Meanwhile, my date had just grabbed menus from somewhere an sat herself on the patio. By the time i finally got someone i basically said \"oh hey, nevermind there she is\" so it isnt like we sat somewhere that the staff didnt know about.\" This ordeal lasted maybe 8 minutes...  Sat down and after about 3 minutes, someone dropped off water. Then another 3-5 minutes passed by and someone came and got drink orders. We got our drinks, finished our drinks, and... you guessed it, nobody. So we hollered at someone that worked there to close our \"drink tab.\" They did and we left.  I'm not sure how long we were there but I'd say an honest 30 minutes between waiting outside like a dork and waiting outside at the table before we called it quits.  To make matters worse, none of the heaters outside were on. Half the time we were there someone was fiddling with it. As it turns out, the last thing you want is a cold date. And before you say it I'm not one who wants a bunch of attention. I don't. But I do want someone to -heaven forbid- seat me and take my order! They looked like they literally had twice the business they were staffed for.  Apparently we weren't the only ones with this experience because a table near us (also outside, family of four) got up, tossed cash on the table, and left. They had it too. The other 4 tables outside with us that were occupied also had no food - and they were all there before we waited around on the sidewalk/lobby/bar waiting for someone to seat us.  I can't stress enough how laid back of a person I am when it comes to dining. No joke, I've had food come to my table with hair in it and I didn't complain. The wrong food was brought to me and I didn't complain. I've had drinks spilled on me and I didn't complain. So to warrant me to rate the place low like this hurts me. But I'm pretty sure most people would have walked away long before I did, some without paying (if you have to get up and track someone down to close your bill...). But the fact is that Blind Pig was attempting to race the figure -8 with a unicycle against legitimate race cars.  The food must be out of this world for it to hold 4 stars with this kind of service."}
{"text":"Had the Henhouse Special, basically the burger with an egg on it. Top 10 burgers I've ever had. If you're in Vegas and looking for an alternative to a casino meal try The Blind Pig!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Great food. Big portions. Friendly servers.   The only cons I can think of:   is the parking is a little difficult. I have only been there early part of the day. I can imagine it could get tricky if it got busy.  I prefer to drink white Zinfandel. But their reisling is pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after finding the Instagram account randomly.  As locals to Vegas we hesitate going down to the strip and overpaying for food and drink.  We were pleasantly surprised to find very yummy happy hour specials for apps!  The quesadillas were yummy!  We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Walked in. Wasn't greeted. Took 5+ min to get a menu and a water... Looked over the menu sat there for 10+ minutes not being offered chips salsa or if I was ready to order.... I feel like this establishment is for regulars only the whole bar was full of people (assuming regulars) and they were talking with the bartenders and ignoring me. (I sat myself) I Don't think I will be back. Kind of a bummer because I like Mexican food and live in the area."}
{"text":"The server was very nice and the venue is nice as well.. but....   The food, a breakfast sandwich, took extremely long to come out. A table for one should not be here for over an hour when the place is not busy.   The breakfast sandwich was suppose to have cheese, it didn't. I had to send it back. The menu says it comes with hasbrowns but it didn't. Apparently they dont have hash browns and gave a different potato instead.   The bloody mary was good but nothing special. I appreciate that they have bleu cheese olives in it.  Took forever for me to get my check even after they took my plate. Overall, don't come here if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Used to be good. The new management and menu have destroyed it. No more poutine, I mean come on!"}
{"text":"Based on recent reviews, I convinced the Dr. we should give this place one more try tonight.  I..was wrong.  We sat outside.  The place was busy but not overly so.  Found something interesting things on the menu. The Dr. ordered a glass of wine while we look for something interest to eat.  She waited and waited.  Ordered wine with our food order 7-9 minutes later and when I didn't get my wine in a reasonable amount of time, I ask the server for it. She brought mine and still had not brought the Dr. hers.  Really? That wouldn't be the servers last mishap of the evening. She went and retrieve the wine but no sign of an apology, I'm so sorry.. nothing. We ordered.  I had the shrimp tamales which were decent enough and the Dr. had tacos which she ordered with flour tortillas and got them with corn tortillas.  I had also ordered a side of beans which I never received.  The guac and salsa where ok to better than average.  Nothing super special (We are two real deal guac heads. We know guac).  The pour of the wines of was very generous. Think 10-12 ounces but when the Dr. tasted my Rioja, she immediately wrinkled her nose and said that is old and sour. We looked at each other with that look that says \"ok we gave them a shot but we ain't never coming back here\" and ask it was time to ask for the check.   I let our server know I never received my side of beans so I don't want to pay for it.  She said 'oh, you don't have to pay for them.  You want them now?' She had just cleared our table of all the empty dishes from what did arrive and our silverware.  I said no, just the check and looked at the Dr. with that 'did we teleport to bizarro world or something'.. We left a small tip and left....won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice little bar and grill off the strip!  Italian food that surprises you,,,eggplant park was terrific, as was the Italian Beef.  We didn't feel like going all the way across highway to the strip, and were very glad we didn't.  Reasonable prices, nice beers an wines, and great food in a friendly place."}
{"text":"Lunch here was fine.. I would recommend it to someone looking for American Mexican food, nothing close to traditional Mexican cuisine. I liked the pork shank \"Wings\" the most.. They were in a sweet sauce and  The jalepeno ranch and salad it came with was very good. I would pass on the ceviche next time, it was more of a cocktail. My short rib tacos were very good, I liked each salsa, red and green, and used one for each. I did not like how garlicky the house rice was, wasn't balanced."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice looking place and fast service. A fan for sure."}
{"text":"Being from the Midwest I'm not use to going nice restaurants in strip malls but this one changed my mind. They have a very nice patio with the inside being a little small. The service was not the greatest (did find out our server was bartending too). I ordered the burrito al Pastor with rice. It was amazing! The burrito was spicy but the meat was very flavorful & the burrito wasn't over loaded with extras. The rice was unique with cilantro & pineapple. My wife ordered mushroom quesadilla & that too was very flavorful! The cheese used was very rich! The price was just right too! Can't wait to stop back!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend of mine, an out of towner. Checked out their menu, and everything looked great! Kudos to Kim for the recommendation of the Salmon Panini! Prices are fair and I can't wait to check out happy hour! This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Nicole and Brandi were awesome. Had the clam in white sauce and pastrami sandwich, both good."}
{"text":"First Time Coming Here. I've Always Seen It Passing On The Freeway. So Far I'm Impressed. Customer Service Was On Point - Food Is A Hit Or Miss For Apps But I'm Willing To Try Entrees. Interior Is Comfy And Cozy. Great Ambiance!! I'll Come Here Again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Blind Pig a few times now and each time I got the filet mignon. Now, I'm a steak person; I love a good cut of meat. I have to say, this is one of the best I've ever had. I'd say even better than Morton's or STK. The steak was so flavorful and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. They just redid their menu, so there are a bunch of new dishes. The service is great and the staff is really friendly. I highly recommend and say this is a must try!"}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointing. I called this place twice to confirm our reservation and specifically stated that we were coming to watch the UFC fight and was assured that we could sit in the bar area or have a table with a good view of the tv. When we arrived we were led to a small table squished in way too close (I mean you could eat off the plate of the table next to you) right by the front door. Mind you, the entire dining area was available and there were plenty of tables in the bar Aaron, the host explained that those were all reserved, strange because I called to reserve specifically stating we'd like to be in the bar and was told they don't reserve tables in the bar... When I began to explain that we had called ahead and explained that we were interested in watching the game and had been told we could get a table in the bar he interrupted me and said, So do you want the table? Needless to say we are standing outside waiting for a Lyft driver to take us somewhere else."}
{"text":"So disappointing :( had this place in my bookmarks for a while. So I had friends in town we checked it out and nothing was good. Had the pasta which was too chewy I know al dente is the way to eat it but not undercooked noodles. There were 5 of us so we tried almost everything on the menu. Only thing that stood out were the fries but cmon how hard is it to make fried potato :/"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's like a more upscale Mexican place that gives you better quality food in more of a Scottsdale, contemporary casual setting, at a very good price.  I came here for lunch a few weeks ago. There's a really nice shaded outdoor seating area, an awesome lunch menu with delicious drinks (they have a full bar), and approachable, friendly service.   I had the Linguica (portuguese sausage) with house rice, and also tried the braised short ribs with house rice. Both dishes were amazing! I also had the Mexican Martini, which is basically just a delicious margarita."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. The decor inside and the menu would imply a higher end bistro, but the quality of food and service would beg to differ. The calamari was pretty much a giant plate of breading, there wasn't much squid to be found. At first glance we were excited about the huge portion, come to find out it was all breading and very tiny pieces of squid that were over salted. We also ordered a steak salad, just some baby greens with cranberries, walnuts, and bleu cheese dressing. She asked how we would like our 'filet' cooked and we said medium. What was brought out was well done minced beef. And lastly our service wasn't that great either! The place wasn't busy at all, only one other table who seemed to just be drinking. The extra plate brought out was dirty with old food stuck to it. My water was never refilled till I asked at the end of the meal only because she was walking by. After our food was dropped off she never checked back till everything was finished and didn't pick up any of the plates. Sorry but this place was a bust!"}
{"text":"So amazing !!!   I'm adding The Blind Pig to my list of favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to the Blind Pig again last night and everything was great. Food drinks and our server Ryan. Ryan, Ryan's helper and the bar tender all promote a very friendly welcoming atmosphere at the pig. Specialty meatball sandwich and chicken wings were great."}
{"text":"Favorite place for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner! The Market (cafe) is awesome, they have great coffee. Service is always fast and friendly. Food is fresh and they cater to vegetarians. Often make adjustments for picky eaters and staff is always on top of it! Love, love, love it!!!!! Thanks guys for a great little place."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the BEST neighborhood joints in all of Scottsdale. Make sure you put this on your \"must visit\" lists! Call ahead & make sure Alyssa is working during the day! She treats all of her customers like they're regulars, and most of them are. Happy hour prices are great for drinks. The food is some of the best in the Valley. If you can't get in during the day, see Daisy or Tenille @ night! While you're in the neighborhood, make sure to try out their 2 restaurants next door,Uncle Sal's & The Side Door. It's really comforting to go into a place where the staff \"gets it!!\" Liz, Johnny, & Maryanne run the bar @ Sal's, & Meredith is @ Side Door. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chose to come here to watch some football before we head back home .. The name hooked us. Got the Philly cheesesteak and turkey club. Both were super tasty along with the Bloody Mary. Service couldn't have been better. Will def come here again next trip"}
{"text":"The Blind Pig puts a unique twist on Mexican food. They also have a great patio. Make sure to check out the short rib over house rice.... Oh my! They also sell Hobe meat to go, so you can pick up some steaks to grill at home.   Yum!"}
{"text":"So I'm an all around huge fan of this somewhat hidden gem off the strip; from the awesome food, to the amazing friendly service, to the ambiance and decor of the establishment. This is def a great Las Vegas Foodie experience in my opinion.   Where do I start? Okay so when you get to The Blind Pig, they have two sections: a cafe or bakery (can't remember the exact name) and the other said as the Lounge. The bakery or cafe side is where you can come in and grab made and packaged sandwiches and salads for on the go, along with breads and drinks. Then the lounge side is the dining area with a full bar and bar seating available.   I'm totally in love with the ambiance and decor of the place! Very chic and romantic dark, like a dapper feel. And the pig decor is not overwhelming. It works. But the place has a dark mysterious touch like one that totally works as a great place to bring someone for a date!! Even the booth seating are tots romantic!!   Ooo and most definitely don't forget to check in on yelp to receive your one free drink!! And what I love most about this yelp promo is that it's not just house drinks, but includes speciality cocktails, speciality smoothies/juices, and speciality lattes or coffee drinks!! So they have a huge variety of drinks to choose from!! And they also have happy hour for drink from 10-close, so that's always a plus! Great drinks to pre-game your night with dinner and drinks before hitting the strip. And those speciality cocktails are sorta strong surprisingly.   Okay so onto food... You cannot leave this place without at least trying the Poutine! I love it! Definitely my favorite starter. They always have daily specials and they are worth hearing what they are to try. My go to is the Steakeasy Sandwich. The prime rib sandwich is also phenomenal. And the lobster and shrimp Mac and Cheese is probably one of the best I've had. They most def are not stingy with lobster/shrimp serving.   Another plus is if you order a salad as your side (you can pick salad, fries, or coleslaw when you order a sandwich) that depending on the dressing the salad is different. Like I get arugula when I order balsamic dressing. And the greens topping are different if you get thousand island. I love that!! Makes the meal different each time!    I've only had dessert here once and I honestly can't remember what I had but I know it musta been good lol but definitely an overall all around great dining experience every time! Love coming here whether it be lunch or dinner. Oh and they have free wifi! Haha so yeh a 5star spot for me!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza and the spinach dip.  The spinach dip was really good.  The chips were \"eh\".   The pizza, on the other hand, wasn't good at all.  It was WAY too salty. I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"I've been here over 20 times because I love this place and the food. However, the service is very low grade. They make mistakes with my orders 75% of the time. While waitresses chat with bartender(s) most of the time and are not caring for their customers. You almost want to raise your hand to get attention. Are they here to work or to gossip?"}
{"text":"Hmmm, let's hire only one server for an entire busy lunchtime crowd and see how it goes. Meanwhile tattoo boy is staring at the waitress from behind the counter doing nothing. What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order?  I received water, but nothing else as I then decided to grab a take-out order. NO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of a cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat - you would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with the white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - cause if your smoking your own meats then the chicken comes with white meat. They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the blind pig! It was so cute inside. We got seated and the booths were so spacious (I love booths). We got menus and then realized we are probably waiting close to 10 minutes with out anyone helping us. We were on a time crunch and hungry so it became alittle frustrating. The weird thing is once we realized we had been waiting quite a while we looked for servers or bussers and there was no one to be found. Finally a girl came over too our drink and app orders.   We got the gravy fries and the pork nuggets to start. Fries were sooo good!!! The pork nuggets I could have gone with out. The rest of the food was pretty good I got the BP burger and my sister got the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster Mac was good not nothing super special. I wish I had gotten a pizza it looked so good when I saw another table order it.    Lastly, we waited for someone to come clear our plates, package up leftovers and get the check. This took  a long time just like before.   So all is all...   Service was okay  Food was good  Environment was great  Prices were very good."}
{"text":"Well is was dead for a Friday night at 6 oclock but happy hour was until 7 so we were pretty stoked. We brought our 1 year old which it does not feel like a place to bring your kids but there had high chairs and our waitress was supper sweet. And our kid is very well behaved and no one even noticed her until maybe before we were leaving and she was yelling hi to everyone at the bar that was finally starting to fill up at 7. The bar is beautiful and masculine. Dark woods and different textiles fill this space up but still feels open and minimal. They keep it cold so bring a jacket if you are easily chilled. The drinks on happy hour are 5 bucks. I got the sunny sunday. Its basically a Cadillac margarita. The blind pig is very very good. More like a vodka martini. We got the meatball app they were dry but they marinara was pretty good. The grass fed Burger was very very good. Well be back for lunch and smoothies and sandwiches will be our next adventure. I have to say the location is super fun and leaving to stare at the back of the cosmo and the aria is a great end to a terrific dinner.  Id recommend for dinner before a night out or pregaming before the club. I lovveee the Blind Pig. Id wanted to come for so long it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Excellent steak salad and taquitos were superior.  Collaboration of Hobe Meats in partnership with Uncle Sals. Still finding their personality, but excellent chow and cocktails.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive excellent filling. Pork in tacos a touch dry. We were stuffed at the end. Best Mexican chow thus far while visiting. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I just can't do it. The Blind Pig has been on my list for a long time and I have just never made it over until today. I was in the mood for a chopped salad and read several reviews about how terrific it was.  I placed my order for the chopped salad and pretzel bites with beer cheese and brought it back to my office. The beer cheese and pretzel bites were still piping hot which was a plus! But the cheese was way too runny, like water. It tasted like onions soaked in water and was extremely disappointing.  The chopped salad was okay, but I felt like it was lacking something. I got the dressing on the side but I had the same soggy issue that others mentioned before even putting the dressing on there. I pushed the salad to the side and saw the bottom had a pool of water.  The staff was nice and I love that they have a patio so it may be worth coming back, but today was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Not easy to find. Easy to forget because it's out of the way. But wow, what a good find. They should simplify the menu but they have good pasta and burger dishes. The pot stickers are a good way to start."}
{"text":"Out of towner looking for a spot for lunch, these guys came up in my search with good ratings. Excellent food, service, and a relaxed atmosphere. Carne Asada Burrito was packed with great tasting meat...you will be full. Also make sure to try the rice, really unique and tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably wouldn't return. Menu, although limited, looked good. Location Separate from the hustle and bustle, which is nice. Would give 2.5 stars if an option-- the place is just not quite a 3. Service was very slow, not super helpful and food was dry- all three entrees and also our appetizer. Over-cooked and under-sauced. Place was quiet and service still sub-par -- too bad because menu looks yummy and ratings on yelp are pretty good"}
{"text":"In town for Spring Training and we like to avoid chain restaurants when traveling.  Found this place.  Great atmosphere, quick service. The food was great, in particular the shrimp tamales were incredible, with amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"The Blind pig is a new spot in the panorama towers... It fills a def need for the residents of this tower.  I came here the first time with some friends how have a unit in the tower and I had a SUPER HIGH EXPECTATION... A fellow yelper had reviewed it as having the \"best burger in Vegas\"... Strong words.  I have had many burger in town and when somebody say that I always question it,  but I also have to try it...   So with that in my mind I came here to see if it was true.  Walking in the door  first impression his is a cool place... Dark tones stone wood and brick..classy.   I sit down and the bartenders were attentive informed and they were not to bad to look at either... I had a few cocktails all were delicious... Then the moment came and the burger arrived It looked fantastic and at first bite I was shocked that this might actually be the best burger in town... It is cooked p e r f e c t l y and seasoned and the bread it toasted and soft and fresh and the toppings are fresh and plentiful but not overwhelming... I started fast but as I got to the end I didn't want it I stop and noticed I was taking smaller and smaller bites... But eventually it was all gone... :-(  As I write this I find my self in that same position not wanting this to end...best burger in Vegas is not far off... It def makes my top 3 I have had and it had some distinguished company!!  Bottom line JUST ORDER THE BURGER... Ten next time actually look at the menu... There is alit of other tasty stuff on it too... Like crispy pork nuggets. That you will just have to experience yourself... Enjoy."}
{"text":"So after a long time coming I finally made it to The Blind Pig and I was glad I did.  Tucked under the Panorama towers on Dean Martin it is a nice spot for the residence. But everyone and their mom can enjoy it as well. They have a deli grab and go side and a sit down dinning area with a pretty awesome bar.   I went all because of their Pork Belly Nuggets a Delicouse crispy fatty nugget appetizer soaked in a Thai sweet chili sauce with peanuts and just the right amount of cilantro. I think the cilantro makes the whole thing so I hope you all like it but if not that's ok because this would be yummy with or without it. The Meaty Wrap breakfast burrito ok not amazing but really good. It have eggs, cheese, ham, bacon and house made sausage I think or of not it was gourmet sausage not no store bought Jimmy Dean (although I love me some Jimmy Dean) I thought that the gourmet one was a nice touch. The side of fried potatoes was amazing crispy, nicely season and cooked to perfection, not to mention they topped them with a little bit of saut√©ed onions which I loved! The salsa that came with the wrap was spicy to the right level and was just chunky enough.  I got a free Green Revolution smoothie with my Check in and my daughter loves it. It was the right blend of Kale, spinach, banana, pineapple, green apple and yogurt. Retail for $7 that was an awesome checkin!   I love the styling and decor of the Resturant Chic, comfy and casual upscale (if that makes sense) I am dying to try their other menu item so I will definitely be back! The only thing is I wish they would promote their brand more like putting their logo on the cups, bags or even togo boxes. It's advertisement and I would love to carry that around and show it off."}
{"text":"It is a Butcher shop and a Cafe combined. Heard about this place on the Jan D'Altry radio show and could not remember where it was until it popped up on a review by Lindsey D. Thank Goodness.  Great place to get some really good Hobe Meats in Scottsdale. I like it better than the 16th Street location. Nice fresh selection of prime cuts. Service was extremely friendly and helpful. Being a sausage maker myself we talked about making sausage at home and recipes for quite a while. Very cool. They also have exotic game in the freezer for those that are feeling adventurous. I brought home a little of everything to try and it was delicious.  The Cafe has a sit down menu with Mexican selections that you can choose from for a great tasting meal or snack. I saw some colorful items coming out of the kitchen. One being the Tacos al Pastor. It both looked and smelt awesome. Can't wait to go back and eat something off the menu as well. Five thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This was some good food. The wait staff was really on top of it. I got the chicken nachos and mahi mahi tacos. Defiantly going back to try more."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try poutine, so that sold me on giving this place a try. We ordered that to start, along with the meatballs. The poutine lived up to my expectations and more. In fact, it makes me hungry for it as I write this review, a couple days later. Other items we tried:  Meatballs: good, nothing special   Lobster and shrimp roll: not listed on the menu, but available; also good, not too mayonnaisy (which I liked) but could've used some old bay seasoning to give it a little extra flavor.  Steak frites: seasoned well and came with some yummy saut√©ed spinach  Our only complaint was the server. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks quickly (with someone else). But the server was nowhere in sight and finally appeared 10 minutes later. Mind you, it's a small restaurant with only about 10 other customers there that night. The server was very nice, but seemed confused when she came over (seemed like she thought we already ordered). At the end of the meal, she asked if we wanted dessert, but there's no dessert menu and she could only remember the tiramisu and one other item we couldn't make out. Don't ask us if we want dessert if you don't know what desserts are available, lol.  All in all, we'd go back for the poutine, but they probably won't be part of our regular rotation."}
{"text":"The shrimp tamale was by far the best dish at our table. If you are super hungry, you better order an appetizer and salad to go with it as it seams a bit smaller than a traditional tamale and comes with three grilled shrimp that sit on top. The sauce they smother it in is so tasty that if I were at home, I might have licked the plate clean. The tamale itself was sweet and full of flavor and the combo of the shrimp, tamale, and sauce was out of this world.   This place has a TV in every corner with different games playing inside and an outside area which is out front."}
{"text":"I went to the Blind Pig on New Year's Eve because it was too difficult to get to any restaurants on the strip. When I was waiting for a table I sat at the bar and ordered a kettle one Martini and all I can say is.. Best martini I've ever had! Very cute ambience as well. Cheers two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! After waiting 15 min for waitstaff to approach, I still had high hopes for this quaint eatery. Although the experience was the worst I've had in Las Vegas period! We have too many food choices for horrible Customer service and poor wait staff. My family spent 1 hour waiting on our food ( hamburger, salad, 2 pizza's) + we never received drink refills. Waitstaff is definitely not working as a team, not sure what's going on in kitchen and where's  the manager? Won't return!!"}
{"text":"Another awesome find thanks to Yelp! We were in town for the Ironman and the husband was hankering for GOOD Mexican food. We trolled Yelp before settling on The Blind Pig and it was awesome. We started off with some drinks and decided that we were just going to order a variety of appetizers instead of separate meals. We ordered the Chips with Salsa and Guac, the ceviche and the chorizo nachos.... and a side of chorizo. Everything we got was homemade and SO flavorful. My favorite was definitely the ceviche, however. A huge portion and the flavor was so good that even the liquid was worth trying to scoop onto my chips after the rest was gone :) The guacamole was very good and the salsas were both rather spicy. The nachos were the only thing that kind of disappointed. The flavors were great and the meat was good, but they were under the broiler for a few minutes too long.. we had to break apart the chips as the cheese melted hard and they were very dry.... oh well, more reason for another margarita ;) A great experience and if we are ever back in Tempe, I will be dying to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and vibe of this place. It seems like the type of place you'd find downtown, not on Dean Martin in what is a sorta strange location. It's worth seeking out, though. James O. felt a little rushed by the bartender, but I thought the service was just fine. Be sure to check-in on Yelp for a free speciality cocktail (or smoothie). It was a little frustrating that they were out of so many things. Straight away, the bartender informed us of at least 6 beers and 3 cocktails he couldn't do. And when I ordered by cocktail, he let me know he couldn't do that one either (so over half the cocktails were out). I settled on The Blind Pig cocktail, which was like a fancier cosmo - a good choice. The menu has several tasty items. But the reason we came was the poutine fries. I was a little afraid of being told they couldn't make it because they were out of something. But thankfully, we were able to order it. It was a sizable portion - definitely more than enough to share. And at $6.50, it seemed like a bargain. While tasty, it wasn't the best I've had. But I would certainly return and order it again. All in all, the menu and ambiance will have me coming back."}
{"text":"Great little spot with fantastic food. The service was wonderful as well. Friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates and anything would have been better then what I received.. salmon with a side of alfredo .. first off I wasn't sure why it didn't come with vegetables it was just a super fishy tasting piece and the afredo was made with spaghetti noodles.. this food was just weird..I would have returned it had I been at the restaurant."}
{"text":"The combination butcher/restaurant is a little odd but overall, it's a cute place.  Seating is limited so if you go during prime chow hours, be prepared to wait awkwardly at the front door until someone feels guilty for lingering and leaves.    I had the fish tacos which were wonderful seasoned bits of mahi mahi atop a flour tortilla.  Husband had the nacho trough which he quite enjoyed during the meal but he wondered later whether it had given him a headache.    Service was a bit slow but they only had one waitress working the entire restaurant.   The menu is a bit all over the place so between that, the hunks of dead cow in the butcher case that judge you while you eat, there's a bit of culinary schizophrenia happening.    We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would return."}
{"text":"Gave the place a try after years of driving by.  Patio with is very nice with the adjacent fountain slash pad.  Now for the food.  Wonderful.  The taco varieties was very nice, just the right amount of specialness including fish tacos.  The Carna Asada burro was full of nicely grilled and flavorful beef.  The mushroom Quesadilla was the hit of the table juicy and delicious.  Not you normal sauce covered Sonoran food for sure."}
{"text":"We heard about this place for awhile now and finally made it happen, on Valentines Day, no less. Had a few reservations around but the wifey woke up that morning craving Carbonara so The Blind Pig got the nod...and it did not disappoint!! We happened to arrive during happy hour so we indulged in a few 1/2 price apps (which were delicious!), a house salad, and shared the entree (chicken Carbonara), which we devoured. Looking forward to returning during a game of some sort. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"We come here when we stay at the towers. It's a really great place for when we want to catch a some  games on the big screen. The food and staff is awesome. There was a miscommunication with a server at one time and Tom went above and out of his way to make our experience fantastic as always. We were very grateful the way the situation was handled. Very classy. My family will be back for sure. The menu is large and there's lots to choose from.   Ps they deliver too... so convenient for breakfast with kids!.      Ty Tom!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Have eaten here twice in the last week. Everything has been very tasty. We've tried the nachos, shrimp and corn tamale, flautas, and quesadilla. And the Key Lime pie is amazing!  Eat on Tues/ Thurs/ Sat and 20% off at the associated butcher shop! Probably the best pork chops I've ever cooked.  Check it out !"}
{"text":"Great food! The pig wigs are the best! Patio is great too! Kinda confused on their deli section( fine meats)  of the restaurant. They should knock it down & make more room for guests!"}
{"text":"First thing, this place is awesome, everything looks brand new , excellent location etc. Etc. But the service was really bad. I don't know if because we went this past Saturday and I personally had to wait like 20 minutes or more to get a drink. Tequila always comes with lime ( they didn't add it ) I had to ask for. My food had to be on spicy sauce  it came plain when I ask the server what happened with my order he went to get a bowl and put hot sauce and told me that I could add it to my food or to use it as a dip sauce. The owner looks mad all the time yelling at his employees in front of everyone. Not a good ambiance or experience for a first time.  My own experience and just sharing it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... very dark and laid back, this place has great small bites to eat. Never really have to wait to grab a seat.. The service is always great. Mostly a local spot for people who live in Panorama Towers. I will be back for more great food and drinks.."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Recently there was an ownership change and it will never be the same. The service was terrible. They got ride of all their servers -who were fantastic.  The food was descent however we were so frustrated with the poor service that it made the food less enjoyable. We got the bill and it was higher than we expected. When we asked about a few items, we were told that the house rice cost $2 more than white rice. That information was never offered when we placed our orders. Sadly, a tradition has just died and we will find a new place to gather."}
{"text":"This was always our go to every trip to Las Vegas. Great lunch and dinner spot but more importantly they had reasonably priced delicious breakfast and the best baked goods including something they called the protein cookie which was one of the best chocolate chip cookies we had ever had . Went in today to get my fix of a cookie. Found out they've completely redone the restaurant and the menu, no longer serve breakfast, and no more baked good. So so so sad"}
{"text":"This place somewhat reminds me of Artisan House... lounge and market all in one roof!!  Aesthetically, similar to dope speakeasies in NYC/DTLA-dimmed lighting, leather booths, and taxidermies.  Came in for a quick drink and I have to say, we were quite impressed.  Had the Bitter Sling which tasted like a toned down Manhattan; make sure to opt for ice cubes for fuller flavor.  Decided to give the poutine and crunchy pork chunks a try.  Surprisingly, both were delicious.  Will come back for their shrimp & lobster Mac n' cheese at a later time though.  Overall, The Blind Pig is a great addition for quick lunch and special occasions.  Too bad this place can be pricey so I can't be here as much as I'd like to.  Also, their market needs a little more work.  Nonetheless, good start for Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"We have been here 3x's.. it's been delish each time! Guacamole is fantastic!  Tacos are great, beans are great! Margaritas are nothing to write home about.. Our service mid day two of the times was with the owner and he was great! Last time was not him and it was less friendly.. food was great every time tho"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the rave is all about? All in all our family of 4 finished 5% of our meal. The pig wings were much too sweet but that's a personal preference. Tacos came with a \"slaw\" of uncooked cabbage which is something we're not accustomed to. Rice had pineapple in it...weird. Both red and green salsa were watered down and tacos left something to be desired. It's definitely a different spin on Mexican food but didn't work for us.Disappointed that we spent an evening here on our 4 day vacation. We're all still hungry!"}
{"text":"I'm tired of people hating on the Blind Pig. I'm a Browns Backer and this is my Brown's Backers Bar. We come here all the time to watch the game. They have tons of TVs and a lot of seating space. The service has always been attentive and the drinks are strong. Its a BAR. And one of the cleaner bars I've ever been to. Its not only a bar, but one of the better and more reasonably priced bars in the area. Also, I've never seen anyone stand on either the tables or the bar. I asked, and even the bartender said that there is no standing on the tables allowed. The people that go to that bar are actually really great people too."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall unassuming strip mall jewel in the rough.  In town for business and found this place based on online reviews.  I'm  always on the lookout for good honest delicious unpretentious food (and I am a card carrying member of foodie nation) and the food was delicious!  Waitress was friendly beyond belief and made you feel like a regular which judging by the number of regs made this place homey.  Raul the bartender makes a mean undiluted margarita. Recommended to have shrimp tamales and did not disappoint.  Can't say enough about this place,"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the short rib tacos as well as the carne asada tacos--both of which had an enormous amount of meat. Next time I would skip the guacamole, which had the pit of the avocado left in and too much lime juice. The salsa verde was great!"}
{"text":"We love this place and go about every week! My husband and I love everything we have tried on the menu. Raul the bartender is awesome, we love sitting at the bar and chatting with him. Great place and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I can't lie...this was amongst one of the best meals I have ever had and my waistline will indicate I have dined plenty to come to this conclusion.  The margaritas are made with Patron and made with fresh lime juice and agave and served up as I like.  We started with the guac and chips.   Fresh and yummy!  And the homemade salsas served on the side really were superb. We then split the pork wings.  I have never had anything like this and am sad I live too far away to get these on a regular basis.  They were so tender and the flavors were wonderful.   It was truly a gift from a blind pig. We then split the braised short rib and mac and cheese.  This set us over the edge but were happy to be pushed to the edge. The short rib was so tender and flavorful.  Very well done sauce as well.  The mac and cheese was better than most upscale steakhouses that offer this dish as a side.  We were completely blown away by the quality of food and the yummy drinks.  Being from OC that meal would have cost us well over $150 BUT with 8 drinks (we are lushes) and all that food it came to around $86.  I AM NOT SAYING raise your prices Blind Pig, I'm saying I am thankful for your food, drinks, service and prices.  Don't change a thing...Oh and PS: come to OC...........NOW!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My order was for pick up but the service was still great very polite over the phone and when picking up! I got a 24/7 burger and it was great the bacon was nice and crisp! Also the atmosphere for the restaurant was really nice they had indoor and outdoor seating which was cool."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind the strip next to Panorama towers is this lovely little joint.  Designed as a prohibition era bar, it has specialty cocktails, an all day breakfast, freshly in-house baked pizzas and tasty grass fed burgers.  I got the BP Burger and Poutine fries. The curd cheese on the fries tasted really really fresh and really really good. The burger quality holds up to any restaurant burger out there.   I hear the lobster & shrimp mac and cheese is amazing, so I shall return for that!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Off the beaten path for sure. Our server Natalie was awesome! She knew exactly what we needed. The food was AMAZING! Will definitely come back for more. A cool little spot for locals."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was an awesome meal.  I went with two friends, and we each ordered different tacos, so I feel like we got a nice sample of what they offered.  We also got chips,salsa, and guac.  Everything was delicious, and I would definitely go back.  I'm also interested in checking out their butcher shop."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I am giving it 4 stars and not 3 because occasionally the chef misses. I am taking it as a slight miss. We ordered using the Yelp app. I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, but I left early. Due to a road closure I got there just before it was supposed to be ready. The hostess went and checked and it was not ready. I waited for another 22 minutes. During which I was told the chops weren't ready.  I was annoyed and there were no real apologies.   Pork Chop - this was the miss. The flavor of the crust was good, but it was tough and dry. Overcooked. Damn.  The cook may have needed to stop when I asked about my meal the first time.   The broccoli and potatoes that came with the chops were great. So that helped.   My wife got he Grilled Shrimp and stated that they were great. She was happy and the spinach it came with was perfect.   Now the biggest highlight and the saving grace were the garlic knots. They were awesome. Simple and wonder flavor.   I hope that the chef was having a bad night with the chops because other than that everything else was good."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place on a whim on a Saturday afternoon. I absolutely love the ambience of this establishment. We sat in the low benches up against the front window. The restaurant has a really cool style.  I asked the server what he recommended and he said that he gets the chicken fingers and fries pretty much every single day so I knew that's what I was going with!  Chicken fingers with hot buffalo sauce were absolutely delicious. The fries were perfect and the sauce was applied liberally.   I don't make it to that area often but if I ever am there again I will definitely go back!   I say definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Grea Beers Great Cocktails Bartenders are attentive and the Food is awesome  Great expierence"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Pizza was good-average. If you go you MUST get the lobster Mac&Cheese-AMAZING!! Very nice, chill atmosphere. Service was great."}
{"text":"A very average bar with average prices.  If you're bar hopping, stop on by... If not... there's probably no pressing reason to go.  Why I was there?  Well...?  It was, believe it or not, a Multiple Sclerosis benefit.  My friend (Who is a physician) was volunteer bartending and served up some serious mixed drinks.  That was definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to reach them by phone for nearly two weeks. They NEVER answer the phone. I've called different days, during \"rush\" periods and non-rush times. Nothing. The phone just rings and rings. Since I can't call and make a reservation for my group, we will select another venue for our celebration."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food! The restaurant is cozy and intimate at night and is great atmosphere for a date or casual hangout."}
{"text":"Date Attended: 10/28/14 (Carryout)  Item Ordered: Santa Fe Salad, Side Salad with Chicken, Steak Salad, House Guacamole Salad, Nachos (3 orders), Pork Wings, Short Ribs (2 orders)  Price : $102 (ridiculously low prices)  Service: The staff was very helpful staggering the time when items came out so they could be loaded in the car. Everything was labeled correctly and all no items were missing in any of the orders.    Atmosphere: Pretty basic inside. All tables and no booths. The bar had a small amount of tequila options.  Food Quality: This is where they SHINED. The food was fricking amazing, the price was even better, and the portions were insane. When ordering the nachos, make sure that 2-3 people are sharing them. Nobody that ordered nachos were able to finish the entire dish. I've never seen an entree with two actual short ribs for this price. We are still trying to figure out why the food is so good, so cheap, and portions are so large.  Overall Experience: Of the 8 people that ordered all reviews were 4.5-5 star with 5 star the majority."}
{"text":"We went to the Blind Pig when It first opened  it was great! Food was great service was great wine selection was great. So tonight was a very very disappointing evening apparently it is been bought by another owner the food is bland they didn't have Chardonnay except for only one bottle nothing by the glass and It was Robert Mondavi.  It's just not the same the feel is different menu is different it's basically just any other old sports bar just like rack it  right up there with PT's.  If I could post a negative star rating I would."}
{"text":"Loved  this place! Every seat in the house was a great seat. No rowdy crowds and sincerely beautiful staff.  We came to watch the GSP fight and we had our own big screen and table on the patio! Best Chicago pizza I have had outside of LA and Chicago!! The owner and his son were very accommodating despite the rush of people bombardment. Our server Shay was a dream and would love to have her again for the next fight!! Thank you Shay for your personality! !"}
{"text":"Holy yum.  Great from start to finish.  Raul it's a great bartender. Sangria is amazing. Tacos are super filling.   Crowd is full of regulars and everyone is nice.  Hidden location in a strip mall. It is worth the search."}
{"text":"Eat here... I am a fussy-butt however my only compliant is that the tables are a bit low and I have to hunch over so I don't drop burger juice on my girls.lol"}
{"text":"Options   I've driven by this place more times than I can remember, but I finally crossed at the right time and so I stopped in for a bite.  Grabbed a seat at the bar with Jared, nice guy, very warm and friendly. The set up was odd. There was an enormous brick column separating one half the bar from the other. Felt like awkward and detached.   Menu was nice and clean, one page.  I went with the BP chopped salad after first ordering the chicken Caesar..my neighbor had already ordered one and when I looked over and saw what appeared to be bland old ice berg lettuce as the foundation, I made the switch. In addition to the salad I added two lobster tacos..one flour and one corn tortilla, why? Cause I felt certain the corn would be over powering and clash with the lobster but like any good scientist, I ran both experiments. I was right, the corn totally over took what was a very good lobster taco.  The BP salad was also good but it was drowning in red vinaigrette dressing and by the time I got to the bottom, I had to force myself to eat the chopped bits of cheese and salami that had inevitably fallen off the fork.  All washed down with a single glass of 'a brother from another mother' whiskey which was treated with lime juice over a large block of ice and garnished with a lime twist. Absolutely delicious cocktail. Best part of the meal. In retrospect, I should have had two cocktails and three lobster tacos on flour tortillas."}
{"text":"i ordered take out from here last night. It was ehhh. i ordered the salmon in wine sauce. it came with potatoes and asparagus. and i ordered a small caesar salad.... the food was blah. the salmon had no seasoning, and we didn't get any togo utensils. the salad was good. the dressing was tasty. but i could've kept my 50 something dollars"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Sunday evening for dinner. The ambience is nice. They have some very comfortable booths. The service we experienced was average. It was good, but not exceptional.  We ordered the steak sandwich and the lobster roll. Both were very delicious, but you definitely pay for that deliciousness.  If you decide to give Blind Pig a try you probably won't regret it."}
{"text":"Next to the Panorama Towers, this place was super out of the way on the strip, to the point where we realized we wouldn't even be able to catch a taxi back, oh my.  We decided to family style a bunch of dishes. Lobster mac and cheese, pork belly nuggets, seared ahi tuna, seared salmon, bootlegger steak and poutine. Everything was crazy good. Dishes were cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and executed well. The meats tasted fresh, tender and nicely done. And a large drink menu that boasted more than I knew what to do with!  Now, what's my gripe?  Service.  If it was any more terrible, we would've needed to call the police because we were not going to pay our bill.  Our server didn't check on us and HELD OUR FOOD IN THE KITCHEN until everything was lukewarm. We were starving so unfortunately, we didn't do anything about it. She never cared if we had water or drinks or had food. We were 1 of 4 current tables. She was watching a sports game.  If it wasn't for the food, I probably would've thrown a fit right then and there.  So come for the drinks, stay for the food but make sure you have adequate time and patience because I was about to get the dishes from the kitchen myself!"}
{"text":"I was totally prepared to love this place after hearing all the hype from Jan D'Atri on her radio show, but was totally underwhelmed!  Husband said \"so\" \"so\", and I agree.  The food was ordinary and over spiced.  The service was  excellent, and the place has real possibilites.  Need to expand the menu from the mexican flavor."}
{"text":"***Alert!!***. They are under new ownership and the entire menu has changed.  The now serve a variety of underwhelming Italian food offerings.  They have not retained any of the usuals that made this place great and the service was horrible.  Oh well...."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars a few weeks ago. We were going in weekly for the corn tamale with grilled shrimp. They were amazing. Then one day in August we ordered the tamales and the flavor of the tamale was way off so we asked about the difference and they explained to us that their vendor didn't have the corn maize and apologized. It was only an apology we also left our phone number for the manager to call us back but they never did. We decided to wait a couple of months to go back. We even called to ask  about the maize. They confirmed it was the old vendor but once again it didn't hold up to the once amazing tamale we went in WEEKLY for. We are disappointed and no longer go back to our once favorite place"}
{"text":"I may have written a 1 star if the wait staff wasn't friendly.   The food was solidly mediocre. My pepper steak tasted like nothing but pepper - very bland. I asked for more bacon on our fries able cause there was almost no bacon on them, and he told me it'd be extra. That's just cheesy. The burger was just OK.   The layout is funky and the owner or manager came by to ask me why I moved from the high top to the low top tables, and I told him the chair I was sitting on wobbled and was unsafe. He went over to it and wiggled the chair, and then just left it. Good luck to the next person..."}
{"text":"Ordered the poutine and pork nuggets as appetizers, then the BP burger, Speakeasy steak, and the roast beef sandwich - The pork nuggets with the sauce, Gravy on the poutine, and the melted cheese on the speakeasy with a pinch of salt! It goes well with the strawberry banana smoothie. 11/10. Ryan, our waiter, offered the best service money could buy."}
{"text":"Been in Arizona 17 months so far , and have eaten here 18 times already , everything on the menu is perfectly prepared , original and makes you want to eat the same thing every time . Be adventurous and order something different sometimes , quesadilla , enchiladas , crab mango stack and prawn tamales are worth a trip"}
{"text":"Service was great! But they took off the best thing on the menu! Pork belly. That.. Is the only thing we want to eat there.. Everything else (food menu) is just average..."}
{"text":"I had read about this restaurant in a magazine and decided to try it. The location is pretty out of the way and people who are unfamiliar with the area would miss it. Thankfully i live here and know where to go.  I will just say the food was phenomenal. Perfect portions, and real quality behind the preparations here.   I thought the atmosphere was really inviting, and made me want to try more off of the menu......STAY TUNED for that update, but in the mean time please know that this place is most certainly worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place.  Really cool spot!  Nice ambience. Not too many parking spots here.  All of the appetizers were pretty great. The service was good.  They remembered special requests.  The server did forget to clear the menus and there wasn't space when the appetizers arrived.   Ahi salad - would not order this again. Giant heap of cole slaw with tasteless ahi tuna   Lobster mac and cheese- there was something in this I didn't care for the taste of.  It was something with a strong and distinct aftertaste.  I'm not sure if it is a seasoning but it was overpowering.  Pork belly- very yummy!  Cut in small enough pieces. Crunchy and tasty!  Guacamole - tasted fresh and satisfying  Pizza - this was better than my entree and I was happier eating this. Thin and simple  The appetizers here are really great.  I feel there were options on the menu id like to try. This place has a lot of potential. It seems like it would be a great place to grab some drinks before a night out."}
{"text":"I used to come here with co-workers for lunch. We hadn't been in a while and what a disappointment. The menu has completely changed. Gone is the mouthwatering poutine, mind blowing brioche French toast, and blind pig pizza. The salad we opted for was overdressed and loaded with onions. The entrees were decent but not worth the difficult location or disappointment of my favorites from the history book."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, you could walk into Uncle Sal's on a Friday night with no reservations and be seated immediately. (Holy crap - has it really been 20 years since I lived in the area?!?!) Those days are long gone. Dinner was on me for coordinating - and I dropped the ball.  Luckily, the Blind Pig was right next door, and we 4 hungry patrons could be seated and served right away.  We shared a couple plated for the table, and nibbled each other's entrees. The steak salad was a winner. The short rib was well cooked and flavorful. And everything else was perfectly OK. I had a trio of tacos  - none of which really stood out. Nothing wrong with them. Fresh, flavorful, well executed. I am just spoiled by other places in my current 'hood.  If I am in the area, and someone suggests the Blind Pig, I won't object.  I also don't think I'd plan another meal there. Nothing in the world wrong with the place - just no \"wow\" factor for me."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! I loooove the decor in the lounge. The booths are awesome and the wall art is pretty neat.   My friends and I came here for lunch and drinks. I heard their cocktails were good so I was super excited to try them out. Kinda pricey but I think it's worth it. I got Growing Apples and Sunny Day. They were both amazing and probably would be super dangerous if you keep drinking them. They taste like candy!   The food was great. We got the pork belly appetizer to start with. The glaze on the meat was amazing. Perfect mix of fat and meat. So yummy that we ordered a second plate! For my meal, I got the ahi tuna Asian crunch salad. It was sooo refreshing. I loved it.  The service was good. They were super attentive and everyone was nice. I'm definitely coming back again! I also wanna try the stuff they have in the market area too!"}
{"text":"Oink Oink~!   In search for a place to go for lunch, I jumped on my handy dandy Yelp app and began my search! Staying in Vegas, there are just so many places to choose from. It really is hard picking a place to eat sometimes! Scrolling around through all the different Vegas eats, I found The Blind Pig.   For those who know me, it would be no surprise to you why I chose this place. It's simple really, I just love pigs :D They are cute, adorable and tasty ;)  Once we drove into the parking lot, there it was! A huge sign that says The Blind Pig. Oh the excitement I was feeling to try this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#tXPFoQrrELdARTlyB03xgA  The inside d√©cor is cute. Reminds me of a more old school, darker, feeling. I loved the booths, and of course I just had to sit in the booth right next to this awesome pig painting! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fgb   So of course after looking over the cocktail menu I just had to order THE BLIND PIG! And to top off my dorky pig obsession, I just had to take a picture of the cocktail with my travel buddy! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=50GFtOwsgv_s3-zyDAEK-Q#11_KCd5ioYZdzFvjboAY6Q This cocktail is $10 and is a mixture of raspberry vodka, grand marnier, lime juice angostura and angostura orange. I thought this cocktail was great!  I definitely would recommend this to guys and girls.   The Grub. [[ ONION RINGS $6 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#5ssr8IflPG8vFbNrEfcJ-g Nomz. This appetizer is great for sharing!   [[ 'BP' BURGER $12 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#Efq3MOqBGAId_Ml3Gh627Q This beef burger is filled with gruyere cheese, smoked bacon, arugula and garlic aioli. Simply delish!  [[ 'BP' PORCHETTA $13.50 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#AI1G03S8-qawZDkRh_IRlA This sandwhich has marinated roasted pork loin & belly with salsa rossa and garlic aioli. Also an amazingly deslish choice!   Overall: I highly recommend this place to others. They have great drinks and food! Next time I come to Vegas I am definitely plan to come back and try more items on the menu! :D"}
{"text":"Back again & we've never had a bad time. Great food, great drinks & great quiet atmosphere. Loving our bartender Aaron. We'll be back to Las Vegas in August & back here too!"}
{"text":"With only one visit under my belt, I can't rave about this place, but I will say it's definitely better than average. Which is why it barely gets 4 stars....    The vegetarian options were pretty slim, but they did have a very tasty mushroom quesadilla, and I really enjoyed the chips, salsa and guacamole. I just wish the chips and salsa was complementary.  Unfortunately, with only one vegetarian option, it doesn't entice me to keep coming back. This really is too bad, because we live right around the corner.  Hottie said his spare rib taco was delicious but the carne asada was just so-so.    We are huge fans of all the Uncle Sals concepts, their food and service is always good. This is no exception. The Blind Pig has great potential, despite the fact that it didn't blow our minds on the first try!  The only thing I don't understand is how the butcher shop ties in with the Mexican menu.   What to expect?  Well like Side Door, it's more of a neighborhood bar feel, nothing fancy.  It will be packed on a weekend night, so prepare to sit at the bar, outside or wait. It's a very small place."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had.. I came here with a group of friends for a birthday dinner and the service was disappointed. Waited over 10 minutes for water when the place had probably a total of 3 guests other than us in the restaurant, the waitress snatched the bread from one of the people I was with. I will not be coming back to this restaurant. They acted like it was a huge problem to get us bread when everytime I've come to this restaurant they serve bread?? I will not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  I don't know why I haven't come here before. The food is amazing, and the Margaritas were delicious.  I had the shrimp and corn tamale, so fantastic.  The tamale portion was so creamy and moist, scrumptious.  My friend had the nachos and my husband had the Torta.  The portions are very generous and so tasty.  I can't wait to come back for more.  By the way, there is not butcher are anymore, so the restaurant is a bit larger than what it was."}
{"text":"Finally, an establishment that names itself after its target customers...  THE UP-SIDE: They serve beer and liquor.  Not bad for people watching.  THE DOWN-SIDE: This place is pretty crummy.  It feels \"dirty\" and \"gross.\"    THE SUM-IT-UP: Go here if you're looking to get drunk and find an easy piece to take home; pretty much the best and worst thing I have to say about this place."}
{"text":"Love this place!  First time checking in and reviewing (because I'm trying to give back to the Yelp community more), but I've been here a bunch of times.  Start out with the Pig Wings - best BBQ ribs you'll ever have (well, pork ribs - my beef ribs are pretty hard to beat).  Never was much of a 'dipper', but the dipping sauce for the Pig Wings has got me dipping wings in blue cheese now.    Then, go for the Shrimp Tamales.  Grilled shrimp on sweet corn tamales, smothered in a creamy sauce that's got a citrus-tart kick that contrasts perfectly with the tamale.  Amazing.  Then, finish off with the Key Lime Pie - best Key Lime Pie I've had anywhere!!"}
{"text":"It's opening night and I happened to stumble upon this restaurant. If I were a Scottsdale native, I'd be here regularly. I ordered some very fresh oysters on a half shell and the New York strip that was cooked to order did not disappoint! It was grilled to perfection. This was all topped only by the exceptional service from the wait staff. Izzy was very attentive and so were the two guys behind the meat counter. Wow!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp. Good little hidden gem right off the strip. Ambiance and music playing was very nice. I had the pizza (homemade pizza crust) and wasn't disappointed. My husband had a sandwich and he said it was good too.  Service and staff were great."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Stopped by here after looking at a unit in The Martin. Extremely friendly staff and delicious food. I had the French Dip. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great spot to enjoy elevated Mexican fare with a convenient location tucked in the corner of  shopping center, with indoor and outdoor and bar seating options.   Taking advantage of the cooling weather I secured a table on the patio near a fountain, scanned the menu but as usual was tempted by the current special which was crab tostadas featuring a generous portion of crab meat, fresh Pico De Gallo style salsa including avocados, corn, jalapenos, and red onions.  Served with a unique spin on tarter sauce (I believe it was cream based) along with a red sauce.  I  only used a few drops of each as the fresh ingredients worked well on their own.   If your dish comes with rice I highly recommend going with the house rice, the pickled veggies  included with some of the menu items are also great, both would be worth ordering as a side if your dish doesn't include them."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig in Vegas was just as advertised, half take out cafe and half lounge.  The lounge had a pulse and vibe, very Manhattan like.  Just like everyone said, check in on Yelp and get a free cocktail! The reason you go there though is the quality service and the delicious gourmet pub food.  I had the BP medium rare Burger with melted Gouda and crispy smoked bacon with arugula on the perfect hamburger bun.  Homemade cole slaw was excellent as were the beer battered onion rings.  Located just West of the strip near In/Out Burger, it is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Have seen this place many times while showing properties at panorama Towers, and have always wanted to eat there today I got my chance and was extremely pleased I ordered the French doors sandwich and it was very tasty the au jus was perfect my daughter ordered the burger and we tool turns switching bites and we couldn't decide which one was better they were both amazing they have crinkle fries and we ordered the extra crisp and they brought to out just like we ordered them, a couple people next to us ordered salads and they looked amazing can't wait to order them next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have ordered take out several times with co-workers and each time we all rave about how much we love the place and think that the portions are a great value. I typically order the chicken nachos - they are amazing - huge portion...so huge, they are served in a pizza box. I can't ever eat more than half of the order and it was only $8 - seriously, great deal. I have had samplings of others food and have been equally as impressed with other dishes from the menu. I have picked up the order a couple of times and have found that the service is always friends and efficient. Even more impressive - the order has always been right. They are willing to split the bill among multiple payment sources (credit cards, cash etc.) I have nothing but positive things to say about this place and will continue to return regularly."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Everything from the salsa and guac to the coconut sorbet is fantastic. And just about everything is under $10."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! I took my friend here for her birthday. We had salsa, guacamole, the tamale, ceviche, and some tacos. The tamales WAS AMAZING GET THAT!!! The drinks were ok. We had the Sangria. In my opinion it was a little weak.   The service was pretty good, hence the ONLY reason I gave 4 stars. They did a pretty good job, but there were a few times where we could have really used someone stopping by. And although we were sharing everything, we really didn't need it all brought out at once (appetizers and main dishes), Although that could have been a miscommunication."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambiance, the staff is not the best but their fresh pressed juices makes it worth a visit."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great for lunch or an after hour drink with friends. We came by after the Rebel Game and took on the great view of Vegas while indulging in the off the charts poutine (fries with gravy and cheese) and meatballs which were the real deal. Highly recommend this off the beaten path gastropub; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I wasn't such a slacker, I'd be the first one to review this place.  Never too late though.  I've been here a bunch of times and love it.  I get the freshly made smoothies and juices to go on the regular.  The interior is fabulous, rich, and inviting.  The booths are insanely comfortable.  These guys mix up the great drinks you would expect from a Speakeasy type place.  Lots of beers and a nice wine list too.  The servers are always on it.  I tip my hat to the Chef.  Brilliant menu creation.  I am currently at the Panorama welcome happy hour with the samples coming around and can tell you this Chef is straight killing it.   There is even a pantry with beers to go, delicious deli items, and what have you.  Outdoor seating with cool strip views.  This place has it all.  If you come to The Blind Pig, chances are you will find me."}
{"text":"Our experience was disappointing. The menu is upscale Mexican, aka gourmet. Chips are available for charge. My burrito (beef) was awful, charred and burnt tasting. Wife's combo tacos very good. \"Rita\" was nothing special and under poured. Would not return and based upon limited covers on. Friday night.... think restaurant has challenge of knowing what they are in marketplace ."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place more and will give it a second try but it was super busy and unfortunately a 30 minute wait for food is just too long for me. Tried 3 tacos (chicken, carne asada and pork) and felt like the meat was overcooked, which it probably was due to the long wait. I'll give it another try but won't be rushing to do so."}
{"text":"This is such a great place, wonderful service, plenty of TV, good slection of menu. Enjoy watching and fun!"}
{"text":"Really great alternative to eating someplace on the strip. We had the pork nuggets, which were deliciously crisp, and the lobster & shrimp roll, which was a decent portion for the price (though mostly shrimp rather than lobster). Friend had the lobster mac and cheese, which I ended up eating a lot of because it was THAT good. Loved the oversized shell pasta and creaminess, definitely not good for pre-clubbing because of bloating, but yolo. Several of us checked in on Yelp and got free smoothies!! We could choose from either cocktail or smoothie, and the green smoothie I had was great!"}
{"text":"Go see Amy at the Blind Pig! She is great! Service top notch, food, and atmosphere as well. If your a Veal fan the Grilled Veal Chop is AMAZING. Nice little gem off but on the Las Vegas strip at Panorama Towers. The menu has lots of great selection to fulfill any pallet. This is also an awesome place to take someone to for a business meeting. On a nice night sit on the patio to get a nice view of the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I have actually been here twice in 3 days and everything we have had has been absolutely delicious. My husband's favorite thing is the poutine. While I'm not a fan of gravy, the crinkle cut fries reel me in. The first time we went, my husband had the burger and I had meatballs and yesterday he had the Ruben and I had the steak frites. Still can't complain. On Friday night when we were there, someone was having a party and they were moving tables around. We offered to move so they could set up. Not a big deal at all but the server gave us a free order of pork nuggets. What?! awesome! Overall, you just try this place. I cannot wait until we can go back!"}
{"text":"Really good food. This place has unique items on the menu. Full of flavor and an intimate atmosphere. Try the grapefruit marg and the chips and quac. I had the pork tacos, but I would really look at trying their sandwich. They were supper busy, but our server flew around the room. We never felt like we were waiting to long for her. You won't be disappointed, check it out!"}
{"text":"Such a great place!  First off the meat counter is impressive...nice looking meats and not overly priced.  The patio is beautiful...next to a nice fountain and heat lamps for when it gets cool.  We heard the patio was pet friendly, but really it isn't...we had to keep our pup outside of the fence of the patio...luckily, it was right next to where we were sitting, so it was as if she was on the patio with us.    The food was amazingly reasonable and super tasty!  We tried the carne asada burrito with house rice, the carne asada and al pastor tacos with house rice and we shared a side of the ridiculously tasty butcher beans...you must try these - trust me, you will understand once you taste how delicious they are!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and found a nice table on the patio with our dog.  The servers were both very friendly, the inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated, the views from the patio were great of the Strip, and the food was good.  I enjoyed a chicken parmesan sandwich with fries and a cider...solid meal at reasonable prices - clearly a locals hangout!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I came across this place! After my first experience it made me want to come back! Let me start with the food. BEST BURGER IN TOWN!!! Hands down! It's like an explosion of flavors once you take a bite! It's so good you don't even want to eat your fries! It's so good it doesn't need any other items to compliment the burger! The blind pig burger was cooked just the way I wanted it and every bite I took just melted in my mouth! The beef was so juicy! The bacon was nice and thick. The best part was it was not messy burger! Pick it up and go at it! This burger has a distinct taste that I cant put my finger on it but you will remember the taste. You may even dream about it lol.  The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it. I came during lunch so it wasn't busy. They have a full bar and a few TV's to watch sports etc. The atmosphere feels positive and elegant. It's a nice place to sit and enjoy lunch.   The price is a bit on the pricer side but after the service you receive and the food you eat it more that makes up for the cost. Sometimes I feel weary about spending so much for a burger but I'll tell you this at the end of the day price wasn't even on my mind. All I kept thinking about was how tasteful the burger was and how nice the staff was.   I returned 1 week later and the same girl was working the counter. She remembered me! That made my day. Whenever someone acknowledges that they remember you it also shows to me that they pay attention and don't treat customers as just a number. I had a great conversation with her when I arrived.   I will definitely make my way back here so I can try out their other items on the menu!   Don't miss out! Go get yourself a BP Burger now!!!'"}
{"text":"I just got back from lunch here and this is now my favorite Mexican place in Scottsdale! The food was incredible and at a very decent price! The food was fresh and the staff were nice. The service was slower than I would have expected but nothing that was too annoying. They have a very large outside section so when its not summer time it would be nice to sit on the patio.   We ordered the house guacamole, which was chunky and fresh. The two dips that came with it were very nice, I think my favorite would be the tomatillo green sauce which was surprisingly spicy (in the best way!). I ordered the Shrimp and sweet corn tamale which was truly amazing, so fresh and the flavors were perfectly balanced. The house rice with chorizo and pineapple is equally flavorsome. My father got a torta which he was very impressed with, and my mother wouldn't stop talking about how her al pastor pork burrito was the best one she'd had since moving here from California. The burrito isn't full of rice and other starchy fillers, its just a proper meat burrito packed with fresh flavors. The portions are large and the prices aren't bad at all, much better than across the street at Carlsbad Tavern (which in my opinion isn't much better than taco bell).  The butcher also had alot of interesting and hard to come by meats, which all looked relatively fresh. I got a center cut bone with marrow for my dog (my dog is 130lbs and eats equally massive bones) and it only cost me $3.47! So much cheaper than at PetSmart and its actually fresh.  All in all, couldn't love this place more. One thing would be the timing of the service but apart from that 100% wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is mouthwatering delicious and staff is beyond uhmazing...stupendous doesn't capture it. With all the piglets in the area from Pig & Pickle, Pig's Meow to the Whining Pig, this spot can get overlooked. Small, cozy and intimate without sacrificing personal space, you'll enjoy all the patrons that frequent here. But if you have wander lust when it comes to food and service, you'll think you walked through the looking glass of heavenly spot that's got to be a mirage in the desert. Raul is the perfect bartender, host, and entertainer along with the entourage of wonderful wait staff. He'll mesmerize you with his skillful acrobatics of making a \"mexican margarita.\" And who can refuse $3 Tecates on HH?   If you have read my reviews, it is no shocker I went for the stuffed burger. Why? I love COW. What better place to trust the meat than a butcher shop eh?! And it was stuffed with serrano chilies. Happiness eruptions from that combo! I love that the bun was actually smaller than the beef pattie. Since they don't serve fries, add the white cheddar mac'n'cheese. Believe me, there is no disappointment. My boyfriend had the dinner special which was the Mahi Mahi accompanied by chorizo pineapple rice. Let's say, Harry met Sally at this juncture of our date. As for appetizers, you will be pleasantly surprised by the half order of oysters and nachos. For most, that's an entire meal but I have a 3000 caloric intake that demands A LOT of food. The tacos are good, perfectly seasoned. OOHHAAHH, in two weeks they will be serving breakfast burritos at 9am on Sunday. I don't think I will leave. Honestly, this quality service and food deserves major accolades. I'm just happy they are humbly priced. What are you waiting for? Stop reading and pull up a chair next to us!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I came in with two fiends of mine. A old man said nasty things to me when I came in..The bartender \"Aaron\"told us to take it because we would be kicked out before he would!! Are you kidding me?! Because this terrible man is there more than I am he has the right to talk to me anyway he wants to?? I have never been more offended in a restaurant.. I can't believe that someone would allow this disgusting behavior to happen.. How is a man able to threaten women,, and the bartender thinks that's okay? I can't Believe behavior like this still exists!! This was such a terrible experience and I will never be back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is going on my top 5 best little restaurants in az . I over ordered but finished off every plate . 5 star little gem here ."}
{"text":"I came here at 3pm to meet with a client on a Friday - NOBODY was here!  I had to ask if they were open (they were).  Food was decent, had a salad with grilled chicken on it (can't remember the name, but they didn't scrimp on the protein like some places do).  It was okay, I'd have to come back during a busier time to test their wait staff.  My client loved the carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"Spent a month in Vegas recently for work and I was very pleased to find this place right next to my hotel. I ended up going there every night either for dinner or just to get some beers (or often to get trashed muahahah). Literally fell in love with Sierra, Kelly and Eliesha (sp?). It instantly felt like a hometown bar. I'm really upset that I forget the redheaded bartenders name but he was a super cool guy! Great wings!!!"}
{"text":"At first, I was a little hesitant because upon entering this establishment I felt as though It wouldn't meet the idea of of my expectations. However, after receiving my meal I was astounded at the quality of food and excellent craftsmanship of my old fashion drink.  First my burger, I ordered the signature burger as I often do as a bench mark for a first visit. The burger was prepared perfectly and the marriage of flavors was astounding, possibly the best in Vegas.  After being dazzled by the myriad of fine whiskies on their bar shelves, I resolved to test the bar maids abilities. I use the old fashion as a benchmark for drinks as it is somewhat simple but often made poorly by morons posing as mixologists. Once again I was sent reeling at the unfathomable excellence of the cocktail I had just sampled. The vast knowledge and competence of the bar maid \" Melissa\" certainly exceeds that of the finest in the area. A true connoisseur and a master in the art of fine beverage mixology. Overall, I must recommend this restaurant to any person who appreciates good food and fine drinks."}
{"text":"The food and service is wonderful. The pork belly nuggets are our favorite and Our waiter was the best.  We also ordered sandwiches and they were delicious too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food is good but like a great chef using mediocre product. Tasty but flawed. Delivery is a plus and the Pantry comes in handy. The Crispy Pork Nuggets are awesome."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place! Back in 2008-2009, I worked at Panorama Towers, and use to always say how a restaurant would be the perfect addition to the empty retail buildings outside. About time someone made it happen.  The Blind Pig has two areas. A cafe/pastry to go style side, and a restaurant/bar side. The booths are big and flashy looking, and it reminds me of a modern day, well lit, speakeasy, that isn't a secret.  I tried the chicken wings and meatballs as appetizers. A Bloody Mary cocktail for a drink. And for main entrees I tried the lobster/shrimp mac and cheese and the lobster roll.  The seafood dishes were both on point. Down the the roll used, the bread was fresh, not to soft, and perfectly toasted. I was also happy with both apps. Veal in a meatball is an instant winner in my opinion. And the blue cheese seemed as it was made in house. Nice and chunky! Service was decent. Not amazing, but not bad by any means. Prices are totally reasonable especially considering the location. I hope to return soon, and try some of the desserts."}
{"text":"So, I recently discovered this place and it suddenly became my favorite Mexican place in town. It has a weird name, so I always thought it was BBQ or something. I've been back a few times and bring friends. Amy, is usually our server, and is hilarious and takes good care of us. I liked that she knew my name after only coming there twice. Most places in Old Town, people couldn't give two shits...this was a nice change.  You can sit outside on the patio,which is relaxing. My favorite things are the $7 Patron margaritas. I always get two, because, well, I'm a lush. The bean dip is amazing, but my favorite's the short rib tacos with House Rice. I tried some of my friends' shrimp tamales and macaroni and they were amazing and rich. This is the one of the best kept secrets in the area. So go! Like tonight!"}
{"text":"We came here after a search of restaurants to go to.  This was a rare date night with my husband and I was desperate for mexican.  This place missed the target by a lot.  We ordered tacos and the meat was so cooked it was more jerky than anything else. The tamale, was good, but not what I wanted.  I wanted a traditional tamale and this tried to be a more high end deconstructed fish tamale. Next time, we will just make our own."}
{"text":"A very unique place to say the least. I ordered the fried egg and bacon burger. The burger tasted great but the bacon humorously had one slice over cooked (black) and another slice undercooked. Both of which I just removed and enjoyed the burger without it. Fries were perfect as well. Ordered a couple margaritas and they were me decent but smaller than what I expected and what they costed.  All in all I would come back but would probably come back only invited."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was so friendly and attentive.  Great adult drink selection too ;)"}
{"text":"For an appetizer we had the pork belly nuggets and they were delicious with a great sauce!! I had the roast turkey sandwich and it was pretty dry, therefor didn't have much flavor. A different type of bread and the addition of cheese would have helped. My husband had the lobster mac and cheese and said it was good. The atmosphere was very dark and 'cold' to me, but the service was good. They had a high chair available, but other than that it was not a kid friendly place (which is totally fine) but we just didn't know that before we went so would not go back with kids"}
{"text":"Worst customer service.. so many waiters and not a single waiters checks up on you.. they are all on their phones or chit chatting with each other.. None of the girls were looking around to help any tables."}
{"text":"Impressed with everything! Good prices great service, and fresh cuisines we will definitely eat her again.. Order the pig wings as an appetizer you will not be disappointed..they let me modify my order to add a taco with my short rib taco.. both were excellent.. I would recommend the short rib plate..looked fantastic. Might have to stay another day just to eat here again"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place and expected to get great pork dishes but alas, it's really a Mexican restaurant.  Only one pork dish on the menu.    Food was fine.  Nothing special.  I also took home $50 worth of meat from the meat counter in the restaurant and it was fine, but again, nothing special.  I thought the sausages were pretty bland and tasteless.  I don't plan to go back, not because it was bad but because there are lots of better places."}
{"text":"I seem to have a thing for pigs... in this case , she claims to be blind! So what. This swine has amazing taste , ambience and service ! Just like her Uncle Sal, next door . On a recent visit with a group of friends I have to admit that the name threw me off: Blind Pig , you say? Well! It doesn't sound Mexican! Do not judge a cantina by its namesake. Or a pig by her ummm ethnicity ?? After all, Uncle Sal is Italian! Upon entering, we were seated in the corner of this rather small, but cute and quaint place and promptly greeted by our waitress who gave us ideas on drinks and the once over on the specials. She was super patient with our loud group, ( seriously .. we were noisy.) My drink was the Paloma Fresca  : a light , citrusy margarita type cocktail  , with the buzz of a grapefruit spritz. It was good, light and refreshing. I ordered the Crab/Mango/Avocado  Stack. Okay. Mind. Blown. For $9.. this very robust stack of just what it describes! It was more than enough to share amongst us and still have not eaten it all!! LOADS of crab !! Being from California , I can appreciate how pricey crab recently has been . I was in shock at how good it was ; fresh and how much was on this appetizer for such a low price! My entree : I had a tough time deciding because the menu is full of really , good snd inexpensive fresh items ! I went with the Shrimp Tamale as my entree because it was different. It comes as one tamale with a few shrimp on top and a creamy sauce. It's rich! Don't think because it's only one you won't get enough ,  as you will! My husband ordered the Guacamole and Salsa combo to start and again: Soooo good and enough to share ! Cheap beers; a great wine list; great margs and amazing food. The waitress was so friendly throughout our night here with our loud table and our groups indecisiveness and all of us asking so many questions of her ! She never lost it! Kudos to her! Our dinner group is a bit much , at times!! Can't wait for another reason to visit this cute blind swine ...and her nice patio before the hot summer hits!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch with group of 7... Everyone raved on their selection.  Burrito, tacos, mushroom quesadilla, adovado sandwich and great pour on wine. Service was great...only down fall is no separate checks...we will return."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch because we were tired of eating on the strip while in Vegas for the weekend. The food was amazing. There were 6 of us and each of us had a different type of dish - from a sandwich to pasta to wings. Each of us raved about the flavors in each meal. The beer selection is great as well and must try just the plain black coffee!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was so impressed. The food was fantastic. I had the lobster Roll and it was so fresh and tasty just the right amount of mayo and spice. My wife had the tuna with mashed potatoes and it was made so unique the potatoes had wasabi in it so it had an amazing taste!  The prices were fair. The service was great I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Holy tacos. The tacos, salsa, and guac are superb!  The portions are large and well worth the price. On my last visit I tried the corn tamale with shimp.... Excellent! Thanks for the tip fellow yelpers.   Oh an the wine pours are very generous which of course I love.   Minus one star because the inside could use a facelift it's rather dark and not very inviting. However, the outside is beautiful so sit outside if the weather permits."}
{"text":"What a pearl! The name doesn't convey the nice atmosphere and staff here. It is good Mexican food. We had Guacamole n chips, then a tasty Ceviche. The topper was the Adobo Short Ribs and House rice- delicious. Superior friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So this place is in an unassuming little spot but it has a great vibe. We enjoyed the live music for awhile and the food was fabulous! Only downside was our server- he pretty much bungled everything from start to finish. Hope he was just having an off night. I recommend the crab stack! Yuuuuummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my word. So good! The house rice is the perfect side. It's sweet, salty, and spicy! When I first had it I ordered two more sides to take home. Instantly addicted. Their Al Pastor tacos are perfection! Just the right amount of heat. While I'm not a fan of their ceiveche (too much fish, not enough shrimp), my husband loves it. I am, however, a fan of their sangria. White or red, they're both delicious."}
{"text":"1st Visit.   Prime Roast Beef Sandwich with french fries.  Solid sandwich.  The french roll was light buttery and fluffy.  This is The Blind Pig's version of a French Dip.  Roast beef was well sliced and very flavorful 5oz portion.  At first I thought it was not going to fulfill my lunch hunger pains but I was wrong.  The au jus that accompanied the sandwich was very tasty with the perfect hint of salty flavor.    The french fries were a hit.  Seasoned style fried crispy with light a fluffy potatoes on the interior.  Very nicely done and a huge portion as well.  The meal is served with a dill pickle that was tasty but looked like it had been in the barrel for some time.    IF, you check in on Yelp you can have a complimentary beverage with a choice of juice, smoothie, or cocktail.  Being mid afternoon with a full day ahead I opted for the smoothie.  The Berry Smoothie was excellent with raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries all blended with yogurt. Another success!    I will visit The Blind Pig again and I think next time I will try the Steak Sandwich because of the employee recommendation."}
{"text":"Great for casual quick meal or for extended date. The lighting is fabulous, the food is interesting and varied, the bar has wonderful cocktails and the environment is extremely inviting"}
{"text":"We happened into this place on a Friday night because of the Yelp reviews. Other than the fact that it's tough to figure out where the hostess stand is and if we are supposed to seat ourselves, it's very friendly. It wasn't very busy but was super clean and smelled great. We sat and ordered the queso dip and green chili mac n cheese. So so so so good!  I ordered the chorizo pizza and my husband had the cane aside burrito. Delicious! My only recommendation would be that the pizza dough is a bit doughy. I would have used a gordita (thick tortilla). We will be back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Low key and great service.  Different voices from the strip.  I got the stuffed shells and it was amazing.  You can add meat to it too!!"}
{"text":"While staying in Scottsdale, we were staying close by, and went in to check it out.  What a cool little place!!!  It was the strange but cool combo of butcher shop, bar and Mexican Restaurant.  This place is evidently affiliated with Uncle Sal's Italian Restaurant which is right across the courtyard.  We have eaten at Uncle Sal's and it was delish, so I determined I wanted to eat here.  It was a beautiful day, 80 degrees in January while the rest of the country is in the deep freeze, and I wanted lunch.  It was so beautiful I decided to sit on the patio.  Started with a Cosmo which was strong and yummy.  Then ordered the  short rib taco minus the red onion, which included 2 taco's and I chose the house rice as a side.  Food came out quickly and was simply scrumptious!!!!   The rice especially was tasty as it had chorizo, garlic, cilantro and pineapple.  The taco's too were very yummy!  I had a very attentive (but unobtrusive) server.  This is a great place, and hope to return someday when visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food here is so yummy and different! The atmosphere is what you should go for, it has a great vibe. The only downside is it can be a little busy and therefore take some time for your food/drink order. It's a little hole in the wall, definitely a must see place!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm always a great time here ... food always fresh and big quantities!! Most waiters are attentive and nice. But food is good so I'll always be back :)"}
{"text":"Great drinks and amazing food , open late for industry people.."}
{"text":"Off the strip good find!  Had breakfast here, the meat wrap and sombrero wrap were delicious!  Watch out for the Bloody Mary, it is VERY spicy!  Good coffee, and breakfast potatoes were the best my husband ever had!  Cute decor, American prohibition style!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant and we have found ourselves here the past several Sundays. The staff is so friendly and the food! OMG the food! Everything tastes so fresh and flavorful. The chips salsa and guacamole is outstanding. The queso app is wonderful. And the shrimp tamale is out of this world definitely try it. Also there's always creative specials and every one I've tried was outstanding. This week they had a brisket they had smoked over night it was melt in your mouth. One thing to note there is live music on Sunday afternoon and it can get loud."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here based on the Yelp reviews and it was a great choice. Oh waitress, Mahalia, was really friend and knowledgable about the food. We ordered based on the reviews and her recommendations and were thoroughly please. Delicious food, great atmosphere and good pricing. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas numerous times and am sick of eating at the Casinos. I saw these place and decided it was worth a shot. We had very good service and the Lobster Mac and Cheese was so good and I was so stuffed afterwards. We went back for breakfast our last day and the breakfast sandwich with sausage was delicious. It will probably be a spot I hit every year. I can not stress how great the service was."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great patio, some baller nachos or just an exotic cut of meat, the Blind Pig is the way to go!! I've been here several times, twice to eat and probably 6-8 times to get fresh cuts of meat for home preparation. The guys (and girls!) behind the counter are incredibly helpful, and will go beyond just helping you pick great meats. Last time I picked up some awesome scallops, the gentleman that helped me also suggested some preparations and the correct amount of time required to cook them. (I'm an admitted novice...) They also do some great specials and have a loyalty program, if you check the business cards on the counter. (Bonus: Use the belly app to accrue even more rewards!)  As for dining in, I suggest sitting on the patio. During our last visit, the waitress was very attentive, and the ambiance was casual and fun. We split some fantastic nachos (seriously, my favorite in Scottsdale) and I had a great salad to help assuage my cheese-y guilt! The food was great, as always, and the only complaint we had was that we never saw the oysters we ordered. We were full enough from the nachos, and since we weren't charged for them, we let it go... but we were looking forward to giving them a shot!  All in all, it's a great place. Perfect for a casual dinner, catching up with friends! (Pick up some great meats to take home while you're there!)"}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Worth the wait and I'm entirely IMPRESSED!! The food is tasty and hits the spot and they deliver and their customer service is SUPERB! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. We used two check ins for free drinks and chose smoothies, which were pretty good. Great atmosphere, nice staff, extensive menu. The woman who took our orders seemed a little agitated since we didn't buy anything else, but, it was their cupon deal, so... Oh, and they came out to check on us and our dog twice, which was awesome considering the 111¬∞f heat and that we didn't even buy anything. Can't give five stars just bwcause we didn't try any food."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there...the service was great and the food was good...a mix of apps, sandwiches and pizza.  It was busy, around 12p, and it seemed to be doing a great lunch business right at the entrance to the Panorama Towers.  They even have a small market and deli for people to buy things and take them home.  Had their house \"BP Burger\" and it was delicious...a well cooked burger with bacon, arugula, and gruyere cheese.  It was great.  My only comment is that it came with a small side of housemade potato salad and it was ok...I was not impressed.  If I wanted fries, it is an upgrade and a small extra charge.  My friend had their meatball sub and it was a daily special not on the menu that our friendly server told us about.  He enjoyed the sub...it came with housemade marinara for dipping and he cleaned his plate.  I would definitely go here again...thanks Blind Pig!"}
{"text":"I liked it! I really liked it! I'm a sucker for decor, and I loved the inside of this place. It was like a Speakeasy meets Old Time Saloon. Brick walls adorned with a train set on one end of the place and a stuffed Boar hanging on the other. Edison lights hang over the bar area, and two gold old fashioned cash registers are on display behind the bar. Above are two hanging pieces of tin lined ceilings. The booths are comfy while there are some tables set up in the middle of the lounge as well. Onto the food.   It is set up like a service counter, you order your food, then go sit down. Available at the counter are some pre made items, like salads and sandwiches. Also a refrigerator that has some pre made items prepared by the chefs and frozen so you can take to go and prepare later, as well as some McConnell's Ice Cream pints. They have a small provision area that kind of reminds me of Resnick's Grocery downtown, I guess if you lived in the Panorama and had a hankering for a hostess treat, this would be convenient. They also have outside seating, but might get a little loud, it faces Dean Martin and I-15.   We wanted to grab a couple items and share, there were so many that stuck out, but we decided on Poutine, which is a favorite of mine. Fries were crinkle cut, that reminded me of my childhood and the Ore-Ida fries that was a household staple. Gravy had good flavor, I just wish there was a little more cheese curds. Crispy Pork Nuggets were really good, small portion, as it is an appetizer and if you ate any more, you might as well drive yourself to the nearest hospital and have your arteries unclogged. Then we shared the Shrimp and Lobster Roll, as crazy as it sounds, the old bay mayo and the fancy hot dog bun it came on really made this sandwich.   I was too full to try dessert, but the monkey bread and the PB&J bar looked delicious. They serve Illy coffee as well as fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.  Definitely will be coming back to check out the vibe of this place at night."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places.  Located in the strip center in front of the Panorama Towers, this is a great place to watch games or just have great food!  They have a great happy hour from 4pm to 6pm each day with half price appetizers!  The menu has a good variety of foods from great appetizers to sandwiches, to Italian food!  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We love this place! we are so happy to call ourselves regulars there :) everything is exceptionally reasonable. the service is fast and friendly. truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Well, 2 tables have walked.  1 1/2 hour wait with no food.  The other tables on both sides of us are upset and have been waiting even longer.  We have been comped drinks.  I would not recommend this.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend from CA, he also agreed great food. Also football game was playing so we got a few good deals on good specials and drinks. Nice staff, on point with service!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, and I'm being nice by saying that. The food is on the very low end of the scale for the price paid. The clams with white sauce I had ordered for an appetizer had fresh clams with canned clams added to it. I do not understand the point behind this. The sauce was over salted by a lot. My guess is the sauce was batch done and left on a warmer to reduce. The Penne Puttanesca was nothing more than tomato sauce with ,I'm sure, every single olive they had in the joint. Not impressed by any means. GF had the Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich. It was pre-breaded frozen eggplant put on par-cooked bread that the kitchen didn't bother to finish off the baking process. I work in a kitchen and can spot shit food when I see/taste it. They are way overpriced for the quality of food they serve. I'm guessing the bar is what keeps the restaurant afloat. If you are looking for a place to watch a UFC fight and have a couple beers, this is a good spot. To order food with those beers is your call but I'd hit In&Out right down the street."}
{"text":"5/7 perfect score.   Party of 20? Not a problem. Bringing a cake from somewhere else? Not a problem ($3 \"outside food\" fee applies, however).   Some members of the party were uncomfortably warm early on, and the staff were kind enough to move our entire party to the other section, which was farther away from the kitchen - even dragging in outside patio furniture to seat us all.  The servers were attentive and there wasn't a single incorrect order across our entire party. Everyone was happy with the selection and the price - where you can spend $10, or you can spend $50 on a single person.   Drinks are a little pricey at $12 for cocktails, but I've never actually been to a restaurant where the Whisky Sour is actually made with egg whites - except this one. All the cocktails were excellent.   They only added in a 15% gratuity to the check. If you enjoyed their service, throw a little more in."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Las Vegas. This is a challenge to walk to from the strip, but not impossible, so I recommended getting a cab. It is definitely worth the trip, though. It was cool enough for us to eat outside, which was very pleasant. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations. I has the Mac and cheese and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Blind Pig several times, and I have never had such bad food. I have attached a picture of my $16 breakfast that is so greasy, over cooked grease soaked potatoes I swear they look like they have been fried several times and my veggie omelet with 2 tomatoes and it's missing the avocado I asked for and the toast is chewy . I had to go back to work so I'm unable to bring it back. Such a disappointment I will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty neat place, with a lot of unique dishes.  The tacos al pastor were excellent, very flavorful, very fresh all around.  All of the flavors were somehow both powerful and not overwhelming, a great balance.  Service was very good and friendly.  When you tell them you haven't visited before, they give you good useful information about the menu, options, sides, and the like.  The only down-side was that my wife specifically asked about one dish being spicy or not, and she was told it wasn't.  But she's very sensitive to spicy foods and found that it was too much for her.  However they offered to take it off the tab as soon as she mentioned it.  I'm a salsa fiend, and found them to be far better than average.  Prices were reasonable.  Not super cheap, not expensive."}
{"text":"Taste bud paradise! It is really hard to name my favorites, I've been there 4 times since they opened and it's true love. I've never had Spanish rice like this - an inventive concoction that includes chorizo and pineapple chunks. You must also have the short rib tacos. You're welcome. The carne asada and al pastor are also wonderful. The guac is acado-riffic and the fresh, limey, just-the-right-amount-of-everything, ceviche is going to be the absolute perfect meal come summer. Go on Sangria Saturday for the perfect experience. The best part are the prices - completely reasonable. My husband and I had an app, an adult beverage and a whole lot of tacos and rice for about $30. There's not a lot of seating inside so get there early in the 100+ degree days. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm dumbfounded... How they have 4-stars is beyond me. The short ribs are ridiculous. New management since July 2017, priced reasonably... give'em a try, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"cool late night spot. the bartender was super chill and had an engaging personality. we had the mussels which were delish as well as the potstickers. the chicken entree was just ok in my book. im glad I ran into this spot."}
{"text":"Had the lobster shrimp asparagus Eggs Benedict...so good. Outstanding food and service ftom Johana. Atmosphere a nice break from noisy crowded Strip."}
{"text":"We love trying small restaurants in our neighborhood.   We like that there are plenty to choose from however, this place, The Blind Pig, is a terrific find and we will make it one of our regular places.   We started off with delicious drinks, had an avocado bruschetta, my husband had the short rib tacos and I had a shrimp and corn tamale.  Every thing was served hot, fast, fresh and absolutely delicious!  We were too full to try the desert so I cannot comment about that.  In addition to the wonderful food and friendly service, the prices were so inexpensive I thought we had the lunch menu!  Great find!"}
{"text":"Should be called the Blind Bartenders. Really cool spot, great decor, horrible service. Bartenders were more concerned with how to get out of jury duty that tending to guests. Sat waiting for my 2nd drink for over 10 mins. Red head bartender was obnoxious and talked over us during rare interactions. Young dark hair bartender with glasses was more concerned with asking the waitress how much she weighed than interact with guests that were waiting for drinks. He sure knew how to clean those glasses tho! I'd never come back here bc the service is horrible, which usually means the management is to. Cancelled our food order just as it came out and left. The bartender could care less why we cancelled our food, why we were leaving, what the issue was, nothing. Forgot to mention how the red haired bartender made my Makers and Coke and added ice last, which then spilled some of my drink into the ice bin. Amateur hour. Oh well. That's ones off our bucket list. DONT COME HERE"}
{"text":"So if I was given one last meal it would be from the place. The food was unexplainable. Fresh full of tons of flavor and super cheap. I would have paid twice the money for the same food. Had the wings that are crazy full of flavor. Orders the shrimp on a tamale all I have to say is stop what you doing and get here now.  The bartender was super cool and threw this frozen pineapple my way again can't wait for tomorrow I will be back.  Thinking about putting my house up for sale to be closer to this place   So I tired this place two days late the wings were still awesome. I had the short rib tacos and it was the best taco I have ever eaten. Also tried the chicken  flauta that was full of flavor. Usually you just taste the outside but the chicken was moist and juicy. Stop reading this and go there now that's the only advice I have for you."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch to catch up with a good friend of mine, and this was a perfect place! Sports bar? Yes, BUT there is different areas to sit and still enjoy a conversation. Food is great; the design of the restaurant is sleek; price is not cheap, but is appropriate for the atmosphere.   I'd love to make this a regular lunch and drinks place!"}
{"text":"This is consistently the best food I can ever remember in my lifetime. I don't usually even choose this type of fare but I am hooked. I have ordered delivery from a separate company like 10 times in the last couple of months. The food is consistently delicious. The gnocchi in vodka sauce is rich and smooth but never too salty. The meatball and sausage roll perfect. The calamari fried just right. The food is seasoned to perfection. I am no food connoisseur but I can recommend this restaurant without reservation!"}
{"text":"Cute place! But they are currently not serving alcohol since they messed up their paperwork with the liquor board and the food was honestly not that impressive but wasn't the worst thing; this is why I'm giving it one less star. However the service here was great! Every employee we encountered was very kind and had a smile on their face! Cary was our server and so down to earth!"}
{"text":"(This really happened .  . .) Boyfriend: \"Honey, I want to tell you something, but I'm worried you'll judge me.\" Me (nervous): \"I, uhh, promise to try and not judge you. Go ahead and tell me.\" Boyfriend: \"I know we were just there a few nights ago, but I'm really craving the short ribs at The Blind Pig.\" Me: \"Are you pregnant?\" Boyfriend: \"NO! Do you mind if we go there again for dinner tonight?\" And here we are, back again, after being here five nights ago; I couldn't be happier! I absolutely love the short ribs (tacos and entree!), the house rice (kind of a variation of dirty rice but with pineapple and chorizo), and the mango, avocado, and crab tower (sooo good that I threatened to stab my boyfriend when he tried to eat more than his fair share). The Cuban sandwich is pretty fantastic, too. If you want great Mexican/Latin food, with attentive service and a nice ambience, you need to visit this place. You'll wonder where it's been all your life!"}
{"text":"Whooooaaa baby I love The Blind Pig. How this local gem is not busier than I normally see it totally blows my mind. A butcher shop (Hobe Meats) and cafe (concept from the owners of Uncle Sal's and Side Door Corner Store) that serves up some tasty food, has pretty darn good service, and very good prices. Can't hate on that.  They've got a nice little assortment of tables inside and a great patio outside. Granted they could probably do more with it from a decor and lighting standpoint, but maybe that's what they're going for, who knows.  What I do know is that the tacos here are fantastic - al Pastor are my favorite and they kick you in the mouth with a good amount of spice that keeps the drink refills coming. The must have for me and the girl every time we come is the Avocado Bruschetta - don't second guess it on simplicity, just eat it and be happy.  The butcher shop here is great and I've picked up quite a few things like their bacon, NY Strip Steaks, and beer brats. They basically have every kind of meat you would need to put on a high quality barbecue for you and your friends.  Come support a great local restaurant and meat purveyor, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was working a job right near this little hidden gem, and we ordered lunch from them almost every day. OMG - SO GOOD!  Each time I tried something different. The clear winners for me were the Pastrami Sandwich and the Chicken Cibatta. YUM!  I grabbed a menu so that I was reminded to go back for dinner. Can't wait.  My insider tip...it is right on the North side of the 15, across from the Aria walking bridge. Great place to grab an affordable, slightly off strip bite to eat before a show, on nights activities!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and took care of us like family (as if we were hanging out in their living room). Probably the best omelette I've had: any 5 items of your choice and no upcharge. Everything came out hot and fresh. The coffee was French press style and they had Firestone' s Luponic on tap. And, I could see 5 TVs from my seat for football-ing. Such a great option for getting away from the Strip. It was less than 5 mins from the Aria/Vdara and no loud drunks or long waits. Worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way through LV. Outdoor seating allowed us to dine with our pets, but this isn't the only reason we'd return. The food is excellent! Fresh and flavorful. Portions are generous and you won't leave hungry. We ordered: App- sweet potato fries and crispy pork nuggets... Do not go here without ordering the pork nuggets, these bite sized sins melt in your mouth. We are huge fans of pork belly and to date, these have taken the award. Entrees-  BBQ pulled pork sandwich (special) and the steak sandwich, both were super satisfying.   Wish there was one near home."}
{"text":"My friend lives in The Martin apartments so it's a quick walk through the parking lot. I immediately noticed the decorations and easy going atmosphere. Our server was friendly. The food was served pretty quickly. Our group of friends had a long night of partying so we were all a bit starving and ordered smoothies while waiting for our food. I can't remember the exact names of our wraps but everyone enjoyed their meals and we all had tons of potatoes left over. This pub is a little hidden gem for locals, especially the tenants in the apartments next door. I also found out they deliver  to the apartments which is another huge plus for those lazy nights you don't feel like cooking. This was my first experience here, I'd like to come back and try dinner and maybe happy hour. Until next time Blind Pig.."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey, portions are to small prices are high, food was ok, although I wanted to order a pasta dish to find out they stopped making it that was a disappointment, staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Met friends here when visiting Vegas. I thought it was right behind city center and planned on just walking there (i totally forgot how not walking friendly Vegas was). It is actually across the freeway and it would have been an awkward walk there so we decided to just take a cab (which of course we got raped on the cab fare.)   The place was roomy and decor was great. I assume most of the people there were residents of Panorama Towers. They also had outdoor seating for those many beautiful Vegas days. Their menu had great choices and I had a hard time deciding. I was a fool to get their pizza! Though the pizza was huge and pretty tasty. My favorite were the pork nuggets! I don't eat pork often but man these were tasty!!! They're like bacon but a bit sweeter and in cube form. You can just eat these with beer after beer after beer and it would be the best meal! Perfect little bites.   My fiancee got the pulled pork sandwich special which he inhaled in about 30 seconds. We didn't even get to see what the dish looked like. lol. Our friends got sandwiches too but was not able to try them. They seemed to like it though.  Service is fantastic, very attentive and helpful and totally sincere. It's a very cozy place, not loud and rowdy. It is pretty relaxing in there and they have a decent selection of beers. I recommend  Blind Pig if you live in Vegas or just visiting."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this small Mexican restaurant. Not at all what I was expecting, good service, nice ambience, great food, and an overall enjoyable time.  This is a small restaurant that I expected to be a sandwich shop. Fortunately I was wrong. It's a Mexican food restaurant that hits the mark.  The service was great.  Even though I was by myself and the restaurant was fairly full they had my order taken and food served quickly and effectively.  Quickly, my drink order was taken and I was served almost immediately. And effectively in that I ordered chips and salsa and a sandwich at the same time, but the chips and salsa came out way before the sandwich did which let me enjoy as opposed to having a bunch of food thrown in the table all at once.  This is a darkly lit small restaurant with nice touches and very clean. It's on the southside of Scottsdale and you would feel comfortable taking clients there as well as your family. They got a wonderful outdoor seating area and indoor seating area and about seven seats around the bar. Nothing feels cluttered, it just feels great.  The food was really good. Chips salsa and guacamole for six dollars served on the attractive tray but not too big for just one person. OK maybe a little too big for just one person but that was OK with me. I ended up having a pork Carnitas and slaw sandwich.  It had lots of flavor and was very tasty. I didn't eat anything that wasn't really good.  Overall highly recommend it. Why does it only have four stars? Because I reserve five stars for restaurants I visit multiple times. I would expect to be editing this one to five stars in the very near future."}
{"text":"Wonderful  atmosphere and delicious, healthy options. I tried the Pig Wing this evening and they were nothing less than Fantastic! I highly recommend this local neighborhood hot spot. Delicious food, relaxing atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and LOVE it. Off the Strip location but super cool Vintage Vegas vibe. Has nip/tuck nailhead booths and a large beer and craft cocktail menu. Had the best dirty martini I have ever ordered. I had a delectable eggplant parm sandwich and my niece had calamari. Quality food and good size portions. I will definitely be back. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Excellent food - had the shrimp tamale , family also had chicken tacos, el pastor tacos & short rib tacos. Very reasonably priced , beautiful patio seating . Could of had music ."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. I haven't been this impressed by a restaurant in a long time. The menu is small, but quality makes up for quantity. We started with the ceviche, which was excellent. Fresh, tangy and on point. I had the short rib tacos & I'm still dreaming about them two weeks later. My date had the pork chop mol√© with house rice. Don't let the house rice scare you... chorizo & pineapple are a surprisingly tasty combination. OH - and they have a full bar! Appetizer, entr√©es & 3 beers was under $40. Mind = blown. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is friggin amazing. Found it when I moved to downtown Scottsdale 2 years ago. I order the same items on a rotating basis. Shrimp tamale (seriously yummy, grilled shrimp on top of a moist flavorful tamale), smoked baked potato--sounds strange for a Mexican food restaurant but it is epic! And, my all-time favorite?  The PIG WINGS!!!!  I can't describe what an amazing meal this is for only $8!!!!  It comes with a jalape√±o slaw salad. You are going to miss out if you don't try this crazy, small strip center restaurant!  Btw, staff hasn't changed since I've been coming here. They remember me every time and I swear I don't eat here that often. Support this biz. It's one of a kind!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the Hobe pedigree so focus on dishes that don't obscure their meaty excellence.  As soon as the accompanying ingredients match the excellence of the meat then this place will have a home run."}
{"text":"So I came here with my friends after work. What an awesome idea! We came in and sat ourselves around 12:00 am. A waitress walked up and greeted us right away. We were indecisive and she was more than patient with us even giving us ideas about what to get. We ordered drinks and skipped the appetizers. The strawberry caiphinira which was amazing! The bartenders drinks are magic here! The food menu looked great they had just about everything you could want. Will be returning for the drinks alone!"}
{"text":"A different spin on what I'm used to in Mexican food.  It's located in a strip mall but don't let that be a deciding factor because it's git a nice patio and really good service.  I rolled in with some people I just met at my hotel.  I was hungry and didn't know where to go.  I heard the front desk clerk talking up the Blind Pig to some people and they invited me to join.    The menu had some interesting items.  Not a lot of things I recognized from a traditional Mexican restaurant experiences.  But I love me some short rib so I ordered the tacos.  They were amazing.  Some of the men at my table ordered the short rib entr√©e which I wish I would have ordered because there was more short rib.  They raved about it.  They also make a fabulous margarita.  No mixer or soda in this margarita.  The real thing!!!  Next time I'm in Scottsdale I'm definitely coming back to the Blind Pig."}
{"text":"It's under new management and it's terrible. Nothing is left of their unique and yummy menu. Over priced mediocre Italian fair. So sad since this was our favorite go to date night restaurant."}
{"text":"I think yelp really let me down this time. In my opinion, I think the bar is just trying to be a restaurant. The service was somewhat slow. Arizona has way better Mexican food places than this joint. The chips were stale, and the guacamole was bland with a chunky twist."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig was a great spot to stop off for a visit before making the trek back to Cali. What caught my attention was the Pork Nuggets. Haven't had Pork nuggets before... What's the harm right?  After blasting over to Sample the piggies - well above the speed limit, I was pleasantly impressed with the look feel and ambiance. I guess I was expecting a dive but it was upscale and perfect for a quick bite.  Service was great, unfortunately it took too much time get our order delivered. 30 mins...    I ordered the nuggets and they were awesome. Crispy crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth buttery on the inside. The fat was rich and a tad too much fat for my liking. Sweet n sour sauce complimented the nuggets. Great combo. Not a big fan of the Russian sauce that came along with the nuggets.  I ordered the Blue Cheeseburger and it was a little better than OK. I've had better. Is it worth a revisit, yes. So minus 1 for service and another minus 1 for the burger. They get a 3 Star."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm... This is definitely a great place to go and a hidden gem. With it being so tucked away in a dark corner of a strip mall and kind of in the shadow of Uncle Sal's, I suppose it can easily go overlooked but do yourself a favor and check this place out!  I've been here multiple times and almost every single time I've tried something different and enjoyed it all.   Lunch for two - Around $30 and WELL worth it. I will continue to back again and again..."}
{"text":"I came in for the pulled pork sandwich but they were no longer serving it. It seems the menu has changed and does not match its name anymore. However the atmosphere was great, servers were professional and the food was good."}
{"text":"A bite of their  bp burger will take you to another world and then to the universe, and I'm not sure if you will ever come back. It's out of this world amazing. My husband and I are huge burger fans. Lets just say our standards are way high for burgers. This burger might have just set a new standard;-).  I don't know where to begin, the bread is soft, the meat is juicy, the cheese is smoldering, the beacon is crispy! no non sense additives are necessary to this burger.  It's a work of art and you can't f* with art period Can't wait to return again btw try the kale crunch salad also(no soybeans)"}
{"text":"I did not even end up eating tonight because of the interaction I had with the manager Christina.  After I looked over the menu I asked for a sample of the tuna salad. Our waitress comes back with an excuse and says she is unable to provide a sample for me because the kitchen was backed up and she's not allowed to get it herself. 10 minutes later the manager comes over and presents the tuna with a nasty and disrespectful attitude. After speaking with her for a few minutes, I let her know that there were multiple misspelled words on the menu. She told me that she knows but it is not her responsibility because this is not her restaurant. Her response made me feel uncomfortable because as a manager you should take responsibility for the mistakes within your restaurant. It's unfortunate that the manager does not care about the restaurant she runs because I enjoy the food and the ambiance.   I did reach out to Block 16 Hospitality to give them the opportunity to make things right but I never heard anything back from them."}
{"text":"Food was tasty.  Atmosphere was a definite plus,  real laid back and super chill also a great place to watch sports and drink. Seafood Diablo pasta was good,  I liked the Lobster and Shrimp roll it tasted better when I squeezed lemon on it and lastly the margarita pizza was ok.  It wasn't the best but definitely not the worst.  And the smoothies were ok which is why they got only 4 stars from me.  Taste all the same to me whether I get it at Tropical Smoothie or DQ"}
{"text":"decided to go back everything back to normal good food and service.parking is still a problem other than that lunch went well"}
{"text":"If you didn't know already, The Blind Pig is a slightly unusual blend of bar/lounge, restaurant and market all rolled up into a space just beneath the Panorama towers. The parking outside is pretty limited and although the space itself is pretty large, there isn't much seating if you do plan to dine in. Even with the limited space, this slightly hipster-esque joint has a very cool vibe and unique styling. The big booths are comfy and having pillows to lay back on after stuffing your face is always a plus. Oh, and quick tip...kids are more than welcome, but it's probably best to bring them along during breakfast-lunch hours.  The menu itself is a lot larger than I expected and has quite a bit to offer, including several options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Adding to the regular menu is Chef specials which seem to be available on any given day. They've also got a full coffee and juice bar that pumps out fresh squeezed mixes and smoothies. To start off, I had an iced chai latte which could hold it's own next to just about any coffee shop in town. It was smooth, creamy and wasn't overly spiced. We also had orange juice and a strawberry-banana smoothie that were equally delicious.  I had a hard time deciding what to order since one of the Chef specials of the day was a meatball sandwich and I love those. Ultimately, I ended up going with the shrimp & lobster roll that I've had my eye on since I bookmarked this place though. The flavor was surprisingly great! There was enough Old Bay seasoning on there to taste without ruining the flavor of the shrimp or lobster, which were both nice and tender. I also appreciated that they don't drench the seafood in mayo. The roll was a nice texture and had enough butter to compliment the ingredients, but at just under $15, I thought the meat to bread ratio was a little off. There was a few bites where I was just eating all bread. Even so, it was a solid sandwich and the potato salad served by it's side was very tasty. Thick chunks of potato with a nice hint of mustard and again, just the right amount of mayo.   As far as the pricing goes, the structure is a bit weird. We also ordered one of the other Chef's specials which was a pulled pork sandwich, and it was priced at $15. The pork was juicy and their slightly sweet but tangy BBQ sauce was great, but I questioned the price. Why? Well, because apart from the $14.5 shrimp and lobster roll, we also ordered a breakfast sandwich that was only $6. Obviously, it wasn't as big but with thick slices of bacon, 2 eggs and cheese on a English muffin, the value was much better. It was easily the best $6 breakfast sandwich I've eaten and was served with a delicious side of lyonnaise potatoes.  Honestly, I came into The Blind Pig with pretty low expectations and I don't know why. I can happily say that both the food and serviced surprised me a lot. Extremely friendly and attentive staff, great food and a great ambience. We ordered a lot more food then we usually do for the 3 of us and walked out for $60. I am a fan and will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out since were looking for decent Mexican food. We were seated promptly with a choice of outdoors on their patio or indoors. We chose to eat outdoors. The owner/waiter promptly took our drink order and gave us some recommendations. Prior to getting dinner, we got some chips with green and red salsa, and Guacamole. The Guacamole here was phenomenal. Certainly in my top 2 that I've ever had.  For the main course, I had the Burrito al Pastor, which was pork with a little bit of heat, but not overly so. I also gotta side of their House Rice which looked like Mexican rice and also had Pineapple in it. The food here is prepared fresh daily and was AMAZING!  Our waiter was very personable and talked to us for some time. He even let us sample their short ribs to see what we missed.  I can't say enough good about this place. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday.  Not busy at all and the food was both excellent and well priced!    Smoothies were great (used the yelp coupon) coffee was good and the food was fresh and tastey!    Really have nothing but good things to say about the restaurant and the service (Mahlea) and the rest of the staff were attentive and helpful.  Put it on your list to hit if you are looking for a great off strip speakeasy!"}
{"text":"Uncle Sal's seems to have a golden touch when it comes to creating affordable and delicious food!  In fact on the way in, my wife and I were temped by the garlicky aroma of the Flagship restaurant next door, but we fought the temptation to try their latest venture.  Food is obviously Mexican/southwestern, but with a definite Italian fusion thing going on.  Interesting take, and for our first visit, we wanted more.  I had the shrimp tamale which was astounding.  The cream sauce was unreal, and the shrimp had a seasoning similar to an oregatana.  I left a pic of it here on yelp for others to drool at.  Words cannot do this dish justice.  I wish there was one more piece of shrimp, though, it was so bloody tasty.  Next time I will ask and pay extra, I tells ya!  Both the bartender and server were great, friendly, and knowledgeable about the food.  Should have gotten their names, but they were blond and brunette, respectively.    Wife had a chicken taco which was yummy, as well as the mac and cheese, which was cooked perfectly al dente.  We will be back to try it again, that is for sure."}
{"text":"Walked out today after my salad took 45 min to be delivered to me.  My husbands order was sitting under the heat lamp the whole time.  Usually love this place but how hard is it to serve a salad when there's just a handful of people in the whole place?"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Nice atmosphere. 24/7 burger is fantastic. But if you have a menu change on your delivery order, make sure to CALL TO CONFIRM. Otherwise you might not get your request."}
{"text":"Glad you all had a great experience.  I wish mine was.  How do you screw up a filet steak sandwich.  Ask the Blind Pig!  Wonder if the bar is named after the owner who was at the table next to me hitting on young women instead of paying attention.  There is no way he could not hear my discussion with the server.  Open your eyes Blind Pig and run your restaurant and keep flip flop wearers out of the kitchen.  Gross!"}
{"text":"Bad night for The Blind Pig.  We came in around 6:30 pm with a party of four and we're promptly seated.   Nobody came around for more than 10 minutes to ask if we wanted anything to drink.  Finally we flagged a server down and said that we wanted to order.  We ordered a couple of beers, a Diet Coke, and a couple of waters.  The waters arrived but no drinks and nobody came to take a food order.  After 15 minutes more, we left.  This place is highly rated on Yelp but because of tonight, we'll never know if it's any good.  However, it is an excellent candidate for Restaurant Rescue."}
{"text":"SWEET & SAVORY   Honey pig I think of sweet & savory.... that's exactly what it was. Came here for happy hour one day w/ a couple of friends & we were allowed to sit anywhere.   The place was smaller than I expected... they had a long bar & about 3 booths w/ maybe 4 tables inbetween the bar & booths. There is also a deli side as well. The place had a very secretive vibe... it was kool though & interesting.   Someone came over & gave us some menus but they said they were  changing up the happy hour menu so they verbalized what items were on the list. We weren't too sure on who our server was... the bartender came over to get our drinks & order for us but some other guy did the rest of the work such as refills & plate clearing.   SHRIMP & LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE $18.50 - OMAN... this thing was rich & creamy goodness... but I would definitely not be able to finish it all as just an entree... it is a bit too heavy for my taste buds to finish all in one sitting. It was a great dish to share so that we all got a little taste.  BLIND PIG CHOPPED $9 - I thought this was a HUGE salad for $9 but it was good. Definitely have to say that it was a bit over dressed to the point the greens were pretty soggy.... will have to ask for dressing on the side next time, but it was REFRESHING overall to compliment w/ the Mac & cheese.  EVA'S GIN $10 - this was the most REFRESHING cocktail that I have tasted in a long time... & I was able to actually finish it & feel fine... so there may have been little alcohol but that's aOK for me. PLUS it was free w/ my check-in!!  Another great thing about this place is that they have HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY from 4-7 pm!!"}
{"text":"I loved the clams in white wine sauce, make sure you ask for extra bread to soak up all of the broth. Over all this place had great ambiance and service, they have seating outside too for those great fall nights. I will def be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a unique find.  Some of the best Mexican food prep that I have tasted in a long time.   The shrimp tamale is to die for. But oysters Rockefeller are prepared perfectly!   Mac and Cheese is incredible!!!!  Awesome place"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service not so good.  Unless you're a regular, expect to be ignored.  We got there around 4:30pm and place was empty with the exception of a few regulars having drinks at the bar.  One of the regulars at the bar (an older woman) had an annoying voice and was excessively loud.  I ordered a margarita and they did not have gold premium tequila ... I settled for the silver patron with no salt.  When drink came it was horrible ... no salt on the rim but excessively salty.  I took a small sip and my stomach was already turning in a bad way.  I got the waitresses attention and let her know that the drink was upsetting my stomach and it was best for me to not drink it and that I did not want to be charged for it.  She said no problem and took the drink away and did not even ask if she could get me something else instead.   I wouldn't be surprised if she gave the drink to the regulars that were at the bar because I overheard one say ... oh premium tequila.  When the bill came the $12 margarita was in the bill.  I brought this to the waitresses attention and she said no refunds on drinks.  Gee, why didn't she say no refunds when I returned it and requested her to take it off my bill (and she answered no problem).  If I would have known this, I would have asked for a Corona (something I know I could have drank without problems).  On our way out, my friend noticed a sign on their patio stating patio seating is for 4 or more only (all the tables are one size with 4 chairs).  Talk about discriminating.  I guess if you're wanting a place to take your date or significant other, wanting to catch up with a friend or are a party of 3, you are limited to inside seating only.   Avoid this place."}
{"text":"First time here, great food and Drinks. The bar tender was very nice.... Suggested some Beer I have never had ...good choice  Melissa (RED) ..will definitely come back:)"}
{"text":"I have issues. Why else would I be this excited about the arrival of The Blind Pig to Scottsdale? It's a butcher for goodness sake! Yet, I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop planning my next visit. It's just that cool and the meat is just that good!   First off, Scottsdale has desperately needed a local butcher shop for quite some time. In the past, I easily put 20+ miles on my car to drive to other butchers around the Valley and every time I did, I wondered when Scottsdale would get one. Now they have one! The Blind Pig is owned by the family who owns Uncle Sal's and the Side Door. The Blind Pig is their newest addition and it's a great one! The meat is fresh, preservative-free and delicious. They have everything from sausages and deli meat, to prime meat cuts and boneless pork chops. It's a meat-lover's paradise. If you're not sold yet, read this: it's also a full-service restaurant and a full-service bar which means that you can stop in for lunch or dinner, grab a cocktail and take some meat home on your way out. They also offer to-go beer and wine so you can grab a beverage or two for home!   The environment is very homey and Fido's are welcome! They have a spacious patio and welcome any dogs. I also learned that they sell fresh meat for dogs! This is a one-stop-shop for all products pertaining to meat and I also enjoyed their marinades. I purchase a boneless pork chop, burger meat and a sausage... all for under $11. The prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of meat. I also purchase the bacon infused marinade which was incredible! I marinaded the boneless pork chop in it and died and went to bacon-heaven with every bite.   In summary, this place is a must-visit for meat-lovers."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Eat24. Food arrived hot and on time. Absolutely no complaints. Good food (Mussels, Caesar Salad, Pretzel bites, and Rib Eye Steak....steak cooked as ordered) The only reason I can't do 5 stars is that it is just a bit overpriced. A bit higher quality for the price or just a bit lower price for the (decent quality) food would make this a 5 Star. Overall....I do recommend and will order again."}
{"text":"The pig wings are to die for.  Portion sizes are just perfect on everything. I had the shrimp tamale and it was simply amazing.  A little upscale price wise, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"So great. We ordered it for take out. I ordered what seems to be a crowd favorite - shrimp tamales. Also ordered the house sandwich. By the reviews, the tamales was everything I hoped it would be, creamy and savory. Soooo good! The shrimp was good too. I was so full when I finished.  The sandwich was huge!!! Couldn't even finish the whole thing. No shortage of pork and quite tasty. I can't wait to go back and dine in."}
{"text":"Service took forever and food was ehhhhh.... We had a party of 7 and the waiter acted like we were an inconvenience for her. Won't be back there again."}
{"text":"Super pretty inside, very chill place to have a drink and dinner. Not loud or overcrowded, and awesome service. Food is hands down the best I've had in a while."}
{"text":"The service. Being in the industry I can't look past how bad the service was when the place was nearly empty at 1AM. The lounge server forgot our third round of drinks and we had to go up to the bartender to order through him.   The food was pretty basic bar food with a lot of different menu choices that were \"Italian.\" Not sure I would make it a point to come back again unless it was just for their yummy gin elderflower cocktail."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner around 630 on a Saturday night and quickly got seated with no wait. Sat outside in the patio which was a good size and spaced out well so that we didn't feel cramped. The menu had a variety of choices all based around an upscale Mexican theme with some unique food combinations.   The food: started with oysters on the half shell and guacamole. The oysters were fresh with sides of horseradish and a red chili sauce which I mistakenly took for cocktail sauce. The guacamole was very good and fresh. For entrees we ordered the Mexican pizza and pork nachos. The pizza was topped with a very tasty chorizo, which was made in house in the butcher shop, along with pickled onions and cabbage. The pizza was very good and we were pleasantly surprised at how the favors combined. The pork nachos were also very good although very basic which is in no way a negative but we wished we had ordered one of the more imaginative items on the menu.   The staff: only two servers covering the patio and the inside seating area but did not feel neglected at all. There were several busboys that stopped to refill drinks and generally helped the servers in a complimentary way.   I enjoyed this experience and can't wait to go back. If you live in the area or are visiting you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday night around 7pm for dinner.  Food -Starter: Bruchetta. Great flavor, huge chunks off tomato and avocado. -Entree: tacos; pollo, carne, short rib. Very disappointing.. dry, lacking flavor, barely any meat. -Entree: short ribs over (house) rice. House rice worth the upcharge, meat was tender and yummy.  Service Slooooow. And just generally not good. Two servers to cover both the bar and dining area. Granted the place is small, but every table was filled, so they were busy.. but that meant we never saw our server... except for when we left and saw her texting up a storm outside.  I'd give it one more try because some of the food was good, but overall, I am completely unimpressed."}
{"text":"Menu can be a little limited; not your average mexican style cuisine. It provides a unique twist on the genre. For avocado lovers, the avocado bruschetta is too die for with fresh avocado mixed with Pico de Gallo and Sriracha for a little spice on toasted bread. For my entree I seem to always gravitate towards the shrimp ceviche. My husband either gets the nachos with chicken (massive portion) or the drunken sandwich. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"OK... this is so easy. You must come here and dine. If Brenda is working just put yourself in her hands and let her help you order...4 items (2 drinks and 2 food items) and she nailed each and every one one. It's called the Blind Pig so Pork is the order of the day. Great place, great food and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Very solid sports bar right off the strip.  Parking is tough but if you find a place you'll find a warm welcome of plenty of tables and TVs.  Beer list could use some mending but there's enough there to please anyone with a good IPA or Belgian for $8 or less.  Menu is large with your typical pub burgers and sandwiches and pizza, but also some nice entrees and pastas as well for a better meal.  Service was good and my burger was cooked perfectly and quite large with the inclusion of a side salad over fires at no extra charge.  $12 burger and $7 IPA made for an affordable meal and great place to watch a game nearby the strip. Blind Pig is well worth it for game day."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is partly owned by the same folks who run Uncle Sal's, which is right next door.  I've actually never eaten here, although it is a restaurant, but have purchased meats here.  Beats the crap out of any grocery store meat.  The cuts are perfect, and while a tad on the expensive side, are well worth it.  They have some unique cuts, as well as the usual suspects.  Never disappoints.  They also have a special (I think it's Tu and Th), where you get 20% off if you are a patron of Uncle Sal's."}
{"text":"Unfortunately never got to try it. Placed a huge catering order and they completely spaced it. Accepted the order and never delivered. Had a bunch of angry people with no lunch is not good."}
{"text":"Just not the same as it was six months ago. Used get the Prime Rib Sandwich all the time but it's  just not as good as it was. Very Bland , the Bread's not the same either. Same with the Kale Salad. Service was just ok, used be really great. This seems to be the norm in Las Vegas after a new place opens they get complacent. Too Bad."}
{"text":"The food was just OK, with very little meat given, and not very filling. This is just another overpriced place to avoid in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place to dance like an idiot to live music!    I would heavily recommend not going downstairs (can be a bit sketchy), but if you enjoy hearing your favorite songs sung by some local ohio band - go to Blind Pig BUT stay on the first floor.  The main floor is the place to grab your beer bottle and use it as your microphone, because you'll be singing along to Bon Jovi!    The important stuff now: Fair drink prices, strong drinks, and short lines in the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"What a great find! This little restaurant has an ethnically confused menu but absolutely delicious meals. The \"Pig Wings\", the guacamole, the short-rib tacos, the key-lime pie were all outstanding. My friend and I just looked at each other and smiled knowingly; we will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a hidden place in the corner of a strip mall. There is a great little patio by a fountain, and the inside is also nice, but small. I would highly recommend the avocado bruschetta and the shrimp and corn tamales. Very reasonable prices for the high quality and thoughtfully prepared food."}
{"text":"Very casual neighborhood restaurant.  It has a great diverse menu and is very affordable.    Great service as well."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the Pig Wings. Seriously, do it. Now."}
{"text":"Love the venue which is the only reason I have 3 stars instead of 2! However when we sat down 3 different waitresses kept asking if we were ready to order as we're looking at the menu! It's like dang calm down. The golden rule is when I set my menu down I'm ready. Then finally we order and as I'm pointing at the menu I say \" the eggplant parmigiana sandwhich\" I ask if there is sweet potato fries as an option she said they are out. So I decided I'll take a side salad. Here's the kicker when the food comes out I get a plate of something that I didn't know what it was. I tell the same waitress I ordered with that it's not what I ordered. She reminds me that it is. Haha I said I got a sandwhich with a side salad. What was in front of me was a plate of spaghetti and eggplant parmigiana covered in cheese and red sauce. She proceeded to tell me that if I wanted the sandwhich it would take awhile. Starving I said forget it. We never saw her again and the guy I was with had to go to the bar to get a refill on his Diet Coke! The only saving grace was she comped my meal. But other than that holy moly this place has horrible service and it wasn't even busy!! I can't really judge the food because I got something I didn't even order. I was overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Outdoor seating! Tried the Mexican Martini... Hornitos Silver Tequila, O3 Orange Liqueur, fresh lime juice, Simple syrup, simply perfect. I salted the rim and served on the rocks. Couldn't tell much difference from a margarita but it was potent.  Ordered the guacamole bruschetta $8, blended with tomato, red onion, cilantro, olive oil and fresh lime juice, finished with a hint of spicy chili sauce. Very good and recommended! Ordered the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla $10. Shiitake & Portobello mushrooms, caramelized onion, jalape√±o, Roma tomato, fresh sharp white cheddar cheese and cilantro. Excellent meal and I had to take half home. Big portions!"}
{"text":"Its 1:15 PM and you swerve, park, stumble and carry your friend into ... wait wait wait this isn't the type of restaurant for that - sorry! The place is rather posh.  We came in for brunch, but they stop serving breakfast food at 1 PM. We sat outside by request, which was accommodated. After a night of drinking I like to get myself hydrated.  Don't expect for the waiter to offer you an ice water.  After ordering drinks, which were quickly down the pie hole [It's the desert, I was thirsty]  we received our appetizer - we rated it a 3 ( once again it's the desert - put it together ) A napkin would have been nice - so I can clean off my whiskers.   I patiently waited 5, 10, almost 15 minuets for my empty glass to be refilled with the delicious drink they first brought me. I promise,  I'll pay for the drinks. Note to self: order two next time.  The food has arrived and man does it look amazing.  The Lemon chicken on point!  Perfect 5 out of 5!!   My partners dish - of which I took only a few bites (so maybe the rating is not as fair)  5 our of 5!  Fresh, refreshing and lite.  Perfect for this desert setting!  We have finished the meal and ready to get the party moving.  \"Where the hell is the waiter at with my bill!\" No just kidding,  let's just walk to the register and ask for a \"to-go-box\" and pay for this 5 star meal with a 2 star service.   :)"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I had the shrimp tamale, which I was glad it wasn't so dry  as they usually are with the nice sauce over top, almost too saucy though. The shrimp was very good though. My boyfriend had the burrito which he thought was pretty good also. I would say I have had better Mexican elsewhere, but this place was fairly similar to any other Mexican restaurant you might eat at. Maybe we weren't there at the right time since we ate here late on a week night."}
{"text":"I've been to the other two sister restaurants in the same plaza, but had not yet checked this one out.  It was a weeknight, and they were not all that busy, so it was a good chance to try out some of their popular dishes.    The oysters Rockefeller / chips + salsa were really great appetizers.  It was my first time having oysters that way and will definitely not be my last.  The salsa was fresh and chips were perfectly warm and salted.  For the entr√©e I got the chorizo pizza - mostly because I like house made chorizo and wanted to give this unique twist on a pizza a shot.  When it arrived on the table, I saw all the fresh cabbage on top and remembered the last time I had lettuce / cabbage on a pizza was the time I tried a taco pie in Idaho - which was an epic fail.  This didn't fail as bad, because it gave the pie a nice crunch / texture alternative.  But the next day, as you might imagine, it didn't quite hold up.  The flavor combination just wasn't ideal and not something I'd order again.  That said, the service was solid and the appetizers were really good so when I come back I'll just try something else."}
{"text":"Food was good. Not outstanding, but good! I got the tamale with the shrimp and cheese sauce and I was impressed but it was pretty rich! The rice had some pineapple in it which was interesting but good. Added to the richness of the meal. The beans were just, beans.  They don't split checks, first off. I have worked in the industry for years and it just grinds my gears when restaurants don't split checks. I've done my fair share of splitting checks and it's just not that hard. I come to pay good money and relax and not have to stress out about my bill and making sure we all pay evenly. It shouldn't be that hard to split checks to keep your customers from getting frustrated. They do not sell their rice and beans as a \"half and half\" option either. So if you'd like to add rice and beans to your meal, you are paying $5 for the rice and $4 for the beans. $9 for rice and beans?! That seems a little outrageous when my actual meal was only $12.   Our server was hardly attentive and wasn't the friendliest lady on the planet. Our food came out about 20-25 minutes after we ordered which isn't too bad but it took a lot to get her to check on us.   I was so pumped for The Blind Pig and I can't say that I won't be back. I just would say that it isn't at the top of my list for Mexican grub in the area.  Another interesting note is that a lady at the bar was yelling how she was leaving and the bartender asked her if she was okay to drive and she said no but she was going to drive anyway. She was LOUD and obviously intoxicated. That's concerning that she could just leave and nobody do anything about her driving in that condition. Shameeee."}
{"text":"Great dinner and margaritas. Had dinner on Busy Saturday night and they sat 8 of us with no problem.  Asked for a \"family style\" service and were accommodated perfectly.  Everything was excellent...   amateurs go out on a Saturday night to an excellent restaurant and expect immediate service...take your time, have a drink, enjoy the dining experience and FEAST on some good food.  Thanks Greg!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy, whether it's for breakfast, juices, smoothies, happy hour, wine, dinner, wine, smoothies, wine, it's perfect! The manager Ryan is super hospitable, the gals behind the bar are always friendly and Amber at the breakfast bar is probably my new favorite person in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Facing Dean Martin Drive in the ground floor of Panorama Towers, The Blind Pig stands unique in its upscale yet unpretentious interior design, its split operation (restaurant/bar on one side, quick packaged deli on the other), and its level of service in its immediate neighborhood.    Friends and I often meet here due to its proximity to Liberace Garage, just down Dean Martin Drive.  You would have to cross over the freeway to City Center and the Strip or travel a several miles west before coming across a competitor.  It sits defiantly in the industrial sector, but overlooking the gleaming towers of City Center just across I-15.  This makes its ambiance, design and level of service almost defiant when juxtaposed with the location, and very refreshing.  High ceilings and retro-industrial feel cross with diamond-tuck booths.  Floor-to-ceiling windows on the east wall make it bright by day, scenic by night, conditions magnified if you sit on the patio.  The bartenders are serious mixologists with great inventory.  The Blind Pig just underwent a renovation of its patio and re-vamp of its menu, so I was eager to try it out.  I was happy to see they didn't seem to change what was already working, with a minor exception or two below.  The patio saw the addition of heavier barriers to the parking lot and heaters.  The menu has always been a bit of Italian fusion, with decent gluten free pizza options, great French Dip and pulled pork.  It was quite unique in its variety.  The new incarnation appears to be an attempt to be more Italian, with other options falling off.  Paper-in-portfolio menus have unfortunately given way to laminated one pagers, with heavy lettering of the I-wish-this-looked-like-a-little-italy-joint.  It's an odd Denny's sort of intro to a place that otherwise seems more sophisticated - not to mention that laminate collects finger germs and is seldom sterilized.  Nobody wants to have to do a hand wash between ordering and eating.  The coffee is a problem.  They don't brew, they use those ridiculous capsules, as if this were a free breakfast at a Holiday Inn.  The cappuccino, while not horrible, is likewise from a machine (you won't need sugar), not a barista.  That's forgivable to me, but not at the ~$6 they charge.  If you are trying for an Italian authenticity, you can't do it without teaching staff to make espresso and cappuccino at a minimum, and don't insult me by pricing like its the real thing when it isn't.  Even a regular black coffee refill will cost you full price ~$3.  It will also refill the landfill, given the amount of garbage created from one cup of this pre-measured capsule stuff.  I suggest dumping the Marriott Courtyard lobby machine and sticking to the real thing.  I hope they change this, I'd love to update and say this is fixed.  The music is usually the perfect level or conversation and is themed to standards of the Sinatra era, at least as of this writing.  It fits well.  The service is consistently good without being in your face all the time.  In short, great design, good menu with these minor quirks to work out.  The blind pig is great asset to its neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cocktails were balanced, food was good and service was friendly, accommodating and quick."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with girlfriends for a weekend lunch and loved it.  Brought a headhunter and his team here for a work-related (aka:  Please hire me!!) dinner and they raved and raved about the food.  Excellent vibe, service, and the bartender was extremely patient with our creative ideas regarding cocktails."}
{"text":"My brother and I walked in . Stood around for a minute . No one greet us so we decided to seat ourselves . One of the gentlemen ( looks like he owned the place ) just stared  at us and looked away . No one came to our table for awhile . The place is beautiful and trendy ! Too bad service is bad n food was not all that ."}
{"text":"They have good breakfast sandwiches as well as a very well mixed menu.  I have not had a bad meal yet and they are convenient with substitutions and sides are delicious.  The lunch sandwiches have a lot of meat and tasty combination of ad ons with healthy vegetable alternatives."}
{"text":"Really sucks. Can't get to go right to save their life. Hopefully the dine in experience doesn't suck as bad. I've ordered the chicken francese to go twice. First time was okay. Second time the pasta I requested as a side was served with pomodoro (maybe the chef hasn't clue what the dish is? Oh bless line cooks.) however first time Salad was wrong. Forgivable. But an entree with simple directions??? Poor kitchen. Poor expo. Poor management."}
{"text":"We were passing by Vegas and looking for a good place for lunch.  Classy looking interior and attentive waiter.  It would fit perfectly in a hipster, brick building downtown neighborhood.  Instead of being a bit \"middle of nowhere\" next to a highway. (as far as a non-local sees)  We had meatballs for appies.  Have to say I can't tell the ingredients (beef, pork and veal) but they were not terrible either.  We ordered two sandwiches:  Chicken Ciabatta and BP Porchetta.  They were decent and flavorful, though the Porchetta was on the salty side.  Their other half of the establishment is a deli / bakery section, which offers a decent selection of desserts or other grab-and-go items.  We liked the PB&J Bar and the Pecan Pie Bar we got!"}
{"text":"A good neighborhood spot, but in the context of Scottsdale, not a great one. This place used to have a butcher shop, too. I guess this gave it an air of farm to table; but the butcher shop closed because the restaurant needed the space.   The pig wings and avocado bruschetta are great. The tacos are average, and come with an overly generous supply of shredded cabbage. The meat in the tacos was overcooked and, while flavorful, dry. Could have been the (Monday) night."}
{"text":"I have to give this 4 stars because the burger is amazing. Easily one of the best burgers in Vegas. Beyond that, the beer is pricey and there is no draught selection.  No happy hour. The service is okay. It's not a place I want to chill at for drinks, just a place to get an amazing grass fed beef burger. I do love the atmosphere though. Very cool location off the strip."}
{"text":"The food was good. I think I preferred some of their more specialty dishes like the tamale with shrimp or the braised pork stuff. The regular Mexican food like... the tacos and burrito just taste like a normal taco and burrito.  Overall, service was good. The dessert was a nice way to end the evening. We had the cheesecake, the lemon pie and the chocolate cake too! Yeah, that was a lot. I enjoyed the lemon one the best while the chocolate cake tasted like a brownie... or had the texture of a brownie. The cheesecake was a standard cheesecake."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The staff is absolutely amazing and the food is yummy. We love the new management and the changes they did from what it used to be. We even had this restaurant cater our wedding reception dinner and it was exactly as we wanted and delicious. It is nice to see them make so many great changes and we love that they have cool holiday specials. This place even shows UFC which is a nice addition. We will absolutely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have been to this spot more times than I can count. The bartender/manager Aaron is top notch on service! The drinks here are great and the atmosphere is perfect!  My most recommended dish is the Chicken Parmesan with Alfredo pasta, I love it! The pizzas here are also great!   If your looking for a place to grab a bite anytime I recommend giving this place a try! The kitchen is open until 2 am and this comes in very handy, especially for the nights I have class late.   If you're looking for a spot to hangout with friends and have a drink, this is the place to go! Very nice relaxing atmosphere with an amazing staff that makes your time here enjoyable and memorable!   For calm warm evenings there is outdoor seating which is perfect. Also, the proximity to the Strip make it ideal for anyone looking to check it out during their visit to Vegas! All in all give this a place a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I try to stop in here for lunch whenever I'm in the area.  I like to sit at the bar and the service is always very friendly.  My favorite is the taco combo with the short rib tacos and the rice.  They put a little chorizo and pineapple in the rice to make it extra yummy."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and they definitely have an affordable lunch menu. Food quality is great."}
{"text":"I came to Blind Pig on a Friday night. As far as night life is concerned, it is a pretty decent place with decently priced drinks.  I'm from Los Angeles so they might be expensive but I don't know.  It bothers me that the place is sort of segregated as far as people go but I had a good time."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot several times and out of those times, maybe, once I had an attentive server. I know, I know, why do I keep playing myself by returning ?   HAPPY HOUR prices are sooooo good especially half off on certain foods. The chicken fingers with their honey mustard are banging! You pay like 5 dollars for 4/5 fingers and fries! You can't beat that.  But sadly the service is what gives this place 3 stars, I started to order two drinks at a time since I know they are only going to come around once during happy hour.  If you go, maybe try sitting at the bar ? Hopefully it might help!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The best tacos ever. Just had the butcher grind me a half  and half of bacon and ground beef. Forget Jack in the Box, this is the true Bacon Insider. Mandy is amazing, she treated me with great kindness the instant I walked in the door. Quinn was so kind to grind that bacon and beef for me."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for our first time and was very impressed! Our waitress was very kind and on top of our tables needs. Another employee was super quick with water refills and replenishing our chips for the salsa and cheese dip!   Some other pros- shrimp tamales were AMAZING!!! Perfect blend of sweet and tangy. My 7 year old daughter ordered a chicken quesadilla which tasted great as well. You could taste the grilled chicken In every bite.   Cons- chips tasted a tad bit stale. The salsa was pretty watered down as well which is always a bummer at a Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Okay food, atrocious service.  Stopped in here on a whim on a Sunday afternoon.  One party at the bar, and we were the only other indoor party.  At least 10 minutes to be waited on.  Ticket time for some oysters, salad and a burger was close to 20 minutes.  Waiter was more interested in skirt scavenger hunt rather than actually waiting on tables.  Food not much to write home about.  Grilled chicken salad was hot chicken placed directly over cold greens.  Pineapple and beans were straight from can.  Croutons soaked in oil to the point of sogginess.  Oysters were mediocre with a red hot sauce that was better left in its jar.  Stuffed burger advertised bacon, but finding bacon embedded in patty was an impossible task.  For premier pricing, one would expect something better than canned ingredients.  Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"No genuine customer hospitality from management,  I ordered from this place everyday, and even ordered more than their normal rate as a reliable customer & I got no love.  If your looking for a warm welcoming, this is not the place unfortunately.   Very sad as I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  But in reality, no true love to their loyal customers which I was once was."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Great southwestern dishes with fantastic flavor. The pork tacos are amazing and make it hard to explore other dishes on the menu but I'm sure I'll get to it all sooner or later as this is going to be a weekly lunch stop for our gang."}
{"text":"Eh, I wouldn't bother coming back here. Maybe I had too high expectations....or maybe the poutine just sucked. (I think it's the latter). I mean, it's french fries and cheese. How come there were only 2 cheese curds? I shouldn't have to send back poutine for crying out loud! The drinks and service were OK, but the food was eh. And that just sucks."}
{"text":"I'm a fan boy of Block 16 (the parent company of Blind Pig) so maybe I'm a little biased, but so far I've loved just about every concept they've developed. Located in the Panorama Tower condo complex, Blind Pig is part convenience store, part bar and bistro. In the dining area you'll find plenty of comfortable seating, especially the booths, set amid a retro-chic prohibition era decor with views of City Centre across the highway.  The menu, as Block 16 is apt to do (see the Barrymore and Public House at the Venetian), features their modern take on approachable comfort food crafted with excellent ingredients. Always a sucker for pork, the crispy pork nuggets ($10) were a great way to start my meal. Unctuous, savory, deep fried cubes of pork covered in crispy skin were complimented with a sweet chili glaze and sriracha aioli that provided a bit of heat. That was followed by a porchetta ($13.50) sandwich with rich, but too oily, pork loin and belly in a crispy ciabatta roll.  Desserts are available, but they come straight from the cases and displays of the 'Provisions' side of Blind Pig. I should have let the coconut cake warm up a bit, but my sweet tooth couldn't be denied. The cake was stiff, as was the icing, but the flavors were very good. Next time, I'll have to resist the urge and wait to eat desserts at home. With their cases stocked with ready made and ready to cook products, there's plenty here for those wanting meals to-go."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig has been taken over by new management.  New menu. New staff. New appearance.  I'm sad about the parking situation. I went here around 1pm on a Thursday and they had blocked out half of the parking spots for customers. This is a tiny lot to begin with....Why would you do this? Oh wait.... They now have valet. Completely unnecessary for day time.   I ordered their turkey club with fries and coffee with baileys. My server was nice, however my club sandwich was missing the Swiss cheese and bacon. I hate sending food back so I just ate half and had the rest to go. I probably won't be back here."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Definitely a diamond in the rough. Just off the strip and easy to get to this is a must stop. I loved the decor and the food was great. We found this place looking for a location to watch the super bowl and its a place that we will be returning too every time we come to Vegas. We oreded the wings and pretzel bites. The wings had just enough kick and the sauce for the pretzels was so creamy cheesy delicious.  Next time I'll be getting the pizza as the table across us ordered and if I wasn't already stuffed I would have got as well!!  The Blind Pig is one of Vegas's best kept secrets.  Highly recommend this bar and pub!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that sucks about The Blind Pig is that it's so far away from my house now!  I used to live right across the street from and would come here at least twice a month.  Thank goodness they are now on DoorDash!  MUST GET: 1. Their taco combos.  My favorite meats are the al pastor and short rib. 2. Their house rice with pineapple and chorizo - best. rice. ever. and this is coming from a professional rice eater (Asian). 3. Recently tried this, don't know why I didn't do it sooner - their short rib entree.  YUM.  Mix the rice with the sauce and you've got one of the best combos out there.  Best part about this place is the price.  I ordered tacos for five people and spent $50.  They used to be a butcher, so the meat is top notch.    If you want some great Mexican food that's not heavy and full of beans, COME HERE!  You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing very tasty food.  Flavor is fresh I'm full and satisfied nom Nom Nom. O and we ordered quite a bit but was cheap and my belly is full blind pig I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love that I found the blind pig!  Their food has always been tasty and affordable. The guacamole, salsas and chips are a must, they are so good! I've had the torta ahogada but I substituted the carnitas pork in place of the chicken and it was delicious. Also their mac and cheese is one of the best that I've had. Its not your typical mac, using white cheddar and throwing some spice in it.   Its never been too busy when I go but service isn't the quickest. Also the place is a bit lacking on creating an atmosphere."}
{"text":"I just stopped here for a to go order, I got the Italian  sub.  The hostess was nice, no complaints about the service.  So when I bit into that sandwich.....Ok, I wasn't expecting crusty bread,  I don't care for crusty bread, it hurts the roof of my mouth.  But for the most part the sandwich was good, I just would prefer it on a nice soft loaf of bread.  I couldn't even eat the whole thing, because of the bread, so I took the other half to my husband.  He said the same thing.  You have to turn the sandwich upside down in order to not hurt your mouth.  Thank god the fries were amazing!  Wow, I son't know what is is with me and fries all of a sudden, but these fries were great."}
{"text":"The food there is very good.  Disappointed that the takeout food section is gone. We own a unit in the adjoining building and went  to the market to take out fruit, bagels and more to take back to our condo.  All gone.  Now, have to order a full meal from the sit down menu and can take that out.  No longer carries bagels and other items for a quick take out meal.  Very sorry to see it gone.  Now have to leave the property and purchase somewhere else like I did this morning."}
{"text":"Had a large group in 30+. Very friendly but just average food and drinks."}
{"text":"This hidden little gem is worth leaving the Vegas strip for. Great food, great cocktails and AMAZING staff. Definitely one of my go to restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good food! I had the al pastor tacos, my mom had the carne asada ones. Both had great flavor! The guacamole was okay- basic, nothing super special, but it was very fresh. The house rice and the white sangria were both fantastic. I would definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Great antipasto salad, really more as a meal for 2. At least! Reserve, gets busy on weekends. More of a fun place, gets noisy."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for breakfast for a yummy meal out. Good atmosphere, good fresh food and always receive great service. Or when we are lazy and don't feel like going out, they have delivery options too. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little chill spot near my friends place at Panorama. They have really good food and excellent drinks! The Tortilla soup is amazing! Mahalia is a gorgeous bartender who is so nice and makes the best drinks, so if I go tell her Kyra sent ya!"}
{"text":"Not super friendly. We live above so we have tried coming multiple times but it's never good. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't great. Right when we got her food she told us we had to pay because she needed to leave. She then proceeds to sit at the other side of the bar to talk to other people. She goes behind the bar to make her own drinks. Somebody sat at outside and after probably 10-15 minutes came in and asked her to have someone help him out there. She said okay. It's been 10 minutes and she hasn't left her seat and nobody has gone out to greet him. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I tried this place and ordered a pastrami sandwhich for takeout.  It was really really bad.  The meat was very dry and not chewable at all.  Every aspect of the meal, even the fries, was below any standard at a food establishment. The fries were drowned in salt.  The bread was not fresh and tasted dated."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!!! I really liked this place. Quick service and delicious food. I had the lobster and crab sandwich with french fries. I really liked their fries, they were crisp and seasoned well. The lobster and crab sandwich was the perfect size, not too big and just enough to not feel overly full. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Those who know me will tell you I am one difficult person to impress, a fact that still has my mother wondering where she could have gone wrong. But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine.   If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.  But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right.   And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.  Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures.   Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.  Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 \"BP Burger\" up against any burger in this town and say simply - \"beat that!\"  Can't wait to try what's next."}
{"text":"I decided to finally check out The Blind  Pig with co-workers on our lunch break since we wanted to take a breather from our EDR. I ordered the BP Burger medium rare, and this first visit was perfect-medium rare like I ordered, everything served hot and fresh, totally excited to come back with the Wifey, so that's what I planned.  We came back the following weekend, and its literally night and day here, no joke. Dinner service here is a bit unorganized. First, there is no hostess stand, so we waited...and waited...until one of the workers came from behind the counter and told us to wait (yet again) until a spot opens up.  We were lucky enough to get a comfy booth, and we took advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free cocktail. I got the Blind Pig and don't remember the name of Wifey's drink, but it had Proseco in it. both were okay. We decide on the Poutine as a starter and split the Blind Pig Burger. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed at the amount of tables she had for her station, and actually the floor manager ended up taking and delivering our drink orders.  Poutine was kinda skimpy on the cheese curds, and the blind Pig Burger which I had raved about wasn't as good as when I had it during my lunch visit, a little more medium than medium rare. I guess when the kitchen gets slammed at dinner time, food doesn't really come out as it should? I probably would just return for lunch where there's no crowds and you can probably enjoy your order much better. Oh, and our waitress never got out of her funk...she was either frazzled throughout the night, or just didn't feel like being there...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3"}
{"text":"Positives - Server was very friendly and outgoing, appetizers were great (pretzel bites and buffalo mozzarella), cool d√©cor, friendly greeting at the door.  Negatives - Server while friendly was a little slow on our drink orders, Italian Beef sandwich was just ok (kinda dry and sauce on the side), Cheese sauce on the pretzel bites while tasty was a little watery.  Overall - I'll definitely return and look forward to trying additional items off the menu."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times with the co-workers, with just a few hiccup here and there when ordering out but overall pretty consistent."}
{"text":"In the land of pricey casino restaurants wanted to take a break, somewhere friendly and cozy, this was the place. Ordered the BP burger, one of the best I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, great bun and the combination of all ingredients made this burger awesome!  I couldn't believe the burger, fries  (which were also great and super hot/crispy ) and a drink came to under $15 in a town where my breakfast at Aria (omelet ) came to $40.  So glad I came."}
{"text":"I just swiped 5 stars, and want to add about 10 more.  Get here.  Get here now.  Hurry.  Don't delay.  This is the 3rd Molinari restaurant in the area that I have been to (see The Side Door and Uncle Sal's) and holy crap do these folks have it down.  This is a non-traditional Mexican place AND BUTCHER, and the food is absolutely indescribable, and you know from my other reviews, I am a food snob - particularly with this type of cuisine.  So reasonably priced it is silly.  We started with the Pig Wings (mini pork shanks) and guacamole with chips, and the freshness screams off the plate.  Three tacos and the shrimp and corn tamale later, and I was weeping with joy.  Super fresh ingredients, combined like a well tuned orchestra; and the sweet and spice in the tamale was literally the best tamale I have ever eaten.  I do not know how they get away with such reasonable prices.  The place is small, but not crowded or loud.  It is so clean, you feel like you could eat off the table or floor - but not too sterile!  It's dimly lit, but not too dark; and the staff seem to really enjoy their job!  They are attentive, friendly, thoughtful, and greet and visit with diners like family!  The butcher was closed, but I have heard good things!  Seriously, this place is an absolute don't miss.  Next time, I want to eat outside, on the super-inviting patio with the fountain.  While the view might only be a parking lot, it is truly charming."}
{"text":"We went tonight at 5pm as a party of 7. We had fantastic service!The food came quickly and was phenomenal! This was such a hidden gem! The pig wings, the short rib tacos, and the mahi mahi BBQ tacos were all amazing!!! I was truly impressed. Honestly it seemed underpriced for the quality and flavor of the food. We will definitely come back next time we're back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Have been to the blind pig a few times from its opening and I will say in the beginning the food was fresher and seemed more homemade and had better ingredients . Lately the food is just bland and seems prepackaged or frozen . I will not be returning . Also 50% of the time my food comes out different than ordered. Oh well many more places to get regular bar fare from in this town ."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day brunch they took reservations so we knew we had a table. The server was completely awesome and very tentative. Each of us got to order our breakfast foods or lunch. Everything was pretty tasty. And the server was nice enough to help us take some pictures of our day."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times because I really want to love it! I work 2 minutes away so it's convenient. Ok... If you go here, I don't recommend you order any of their prepared food.. It tastes very cheap and stale. I ordered the bean salad and it was rotten, they replaced it free of charge but never offered an apology. If you order of the menu, the food is decent, average at best. Burgers are good, lobster roll is a joke, salads use cheap lunch meat. I will say the cheesecake is amazing and it should be for the $7 price tag for a small piece. Most likely won't be going back unless I'm desperate. I'll stick to Nordstrom cafe!"}
{"text":"EH. I drive past the Panorama almost every day on the way to work and I saw the sign to TBP. So, I Yelped it and saw all the hype.   Roomie and I had a day off together and decided to brunch here with another friend. Weather was sunny and breezy so, it was perfect for patio dining.   Walked into their caf√©/grocery/market side and thought that was a super cute idea. How perfs for those living in Panorama to walk downstairs for their good Good of beer, wine, Moet, McConnell's ice cream, toiletries, even Tylenol (for the hangover and errthang). The vibe and d√©cor was very nice and hip and reminds me of LA. I hate saying that but, I feel like Vegas is becoming \" SO LA.\"  We ordered crispy pork nuggets, lobster mac and cheese, ahi crunch salad, and fries. There was nothing crispy about that pork, nor was it anything nugget-like. If you've had chicharron; it's nothing like that! Also, it tasted better w/o the aioli dipping sauce.  Crunch salad was ok; I felt it was a bit too mayonaissey with not enough crunch. Seared ahi on the salad looked bigger on Yelp pics lol And it had NO taste, unless tasting \"mushy\" was a flavor. Lobster mac and cheese was a best thing about brunch for me because I liked the  al dente pasta and light sauce. There was quite a bit of lobster and skrimp in there, too.  Actually, scratch my last comment about the lobster mac/cheese being the best thing about brunch --- THE VIEW of Aria, the freeway, and Vdara was the best thing about brunch --- and I'm not being sarcastic about it.   Service was great tho. The bar was closed but, the manager still managed to make me a Jamie ginger."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night and we're able to be seated right away. The restaurant is cute and quaint. We ordered the lobster ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs. Both meals were delicious and would definitely order both dishes again. The only down side to the restaurant was that is was extremely hot so we were a tad miserable as the heat was set too high. Otherwise cute place."}
{"text":"Great food,  great beverages,  great service and a beautiful setting for a Sunday afternoon.  Thank you,  Tenille! You took great care of us! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The waiter, Jose is really nice and the good is fantastic! the smoothies you got to get one yum Don't miss going here the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here by looking at 4 stars.  We walked in around noon. There was only 2 other customers in the restaurant. I like the ambiance. Nice place but food is below mediocre.  They don't  serve pouccin anymore(kinda came here for pouccin).  The bar girl said they changed the menu a year ago.  I am very disappointed with this place.  The price is very high and service was bad.  It seems there is no team work at this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, very Chicago-esque.  The Poutine was the best part of the meal.  It was put of this world!  The Cobb salad and the Kale Salad were good but not a ton of flavor in either.  My friend got the turkey quesadilla and sent it back because she didn't like it.  Very friendly staff and great service.  There were highlights and lowlights,  so overall a mid-level experience."}
{"text":"I went to the Blind Pig for lunch two years ago and I wasn't impressed and with the new menu for dinner two years later, still not impressed!"}
{"text":"Just not my scene.  It's cool I'm sure if you're you're like 21 and love to do coke. Now the people were certainly having fun with each other and playing drinking games on tables but it kinda felt like I was at a college frat party.  The music jumped from rap to metal to pop. It's mainly a lot of standing space and a few tables. The bartenders looked like they had a day job at a tanning salon. That or they import them from someplace super sunny.  If you're into the college frat scene this is YOUR PLACE, and don't we all need a place?"}
{"text":"NOT THAT IMPRESSED.  Food was good, not great.  The pig wings were ok. Don't understand the hype.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole were just ok again. The shrimp and corn tamale was just good.  You want amazing Mexican food? GO TO THE BARRIO CAFE and taste the difference.  Yes, it's way more expensive, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the food is delicious. My props to the kitchen staff! But front of the house is failed us in this one. I went in w my girlfriend, walked in, waited for 2 minutes & nobody greeted us but the bartender dis see us and he looked away, another minute went by We're still waiting to be seated. It wasn't busy at all. Only 2 tables at the time (slow time around 3pm) FINALLY hosted decided to come seat us. Than our server Eliza came and  took out order. Somome needs to tell her NOT to wear the entire perfume bottle before work, her perfume was so strong I got a headache from it. I couldn't even enjoy the smell of my food cuz the air was a filled with her perfume. She was not friendly at all, she didn't smile once, almost like she hated her job, which made us feel like we were an inconvenience to her."}
{"text":"Update: Much happier with this place now with new management in place. I had previously give it 1-star for reasons I can't seem to remember. The staff here is now full of friendly people and the updated menu has some amazing potential. Will definitely become a regular here."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all... We signed up through their app during our first visit, and earned a free appetizer. Pan fried potstickers, which were pretty good.. the mustard sauce has wasabi in it, so BEWARE... My son ordered the pizza, which was okay, I ordered the Philly cheese steak which had zero flavor, served on a crusty baguette and lacked the right amount of cheese. Just really disappointed overall. Very pricey considering, but a cool place to eat late at night or watch a game/grab drinks..."}
{"text":"Great place and reasonably priced. Had the mole' pork chop and it was delicious. Only negative was the oysters. They were very small."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to order at Uber eats. The portion is big, decent prices, and most of all the quality of the food is superb. I usually order their linguine pasta with clams and/or fettuccini carbonara - both are which the pasta even if it's delivered, are perfect - not soggy. My husband's favorite is their burgers. I do plan to eat at the restaurant because of how extremely good their food is."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner recommended by the hotel staff. Had wine and cocktails (his martini was served in a champagne glass). The waitress was nice and helpful. My dinner was about a 2. I had the gnocchi was as hard as a rock. Very dense and heavy.  My husband had an artichoke chicken dish.  He said it was just ok but had the most unappetizing green color sauce. The salad was all frizee greens. Like eating weeds. Even the bread was dry and soso. Sorry Blind Pig, not so edible."}
{"text":"We planned to go to The Mission but they were closed for renovations. THANK GOODNESS!!! Oh the GOODNESS!!! Friendly and prompt service. My water glass was never empty. We started with the Gauc, salsa and chips. There was lime in the guacamole which was fine and tomato but they leave chunks of avocado so it doesn't seem to runny. I had the Shrimp/Tamale. Fantastic!! The sauce is light not thick and heavy. Delicious! My husband really enjoyed the Torta Ahogada. He talked about that sandwich all night. If we are in the area again this will be our first choice!!"}
{"text":"We ate there the other day. We both thought the food was just right. My wife had the nachos and I had a burrito. Both were carne asada, which was just a little crispy and very tasty. They could have put a bit more sauce on the nachos and also given me a bit more for my burrito. I had a side of refried beans with my burrito. They could have been better. The other choice for a side was rice with chorizo, and next time I will opt for that instead. Judging by what we ate it's apparent that someone knows what they're doing and we are planning to try some of the other offerings. The service was just right too."}
{"text":"Great spot for Spark Plug shots (espresso, vodka & kahlua) and to watch a game.  Great food, something on the menu for everyone. TVs to watch the game. It's the perfect local spot!"}
{"text":"The short rib tacos are really good. The three taco plate is just the right amount of food. The service was good. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Was really hyped from the Yelp pics and reviews . Was not too impressed in the end. They no longer serve the pork belly which I saw on Yelp several times . There is no viable parking just a free valet . The prices weren't anything to write home about (a modelo negro bottle was $7) . Food and selection was decent hence the 3 stars . Would not go out of my way to come again"}
{"text":"Came here for a post medical exam celebration with 3 other people at 6pm. So glad there was no wait! You seat yourself upon entering and we decided to sit in one of the fancy upholstered booths.   4-7pm is happy hour so my girlfriend and I decided to get a cocktail. $5 for the discounted price and it was a  pretty strong drink! I ended up getting something off their regular drink menu, the no sleep 'til Brooklyn. It tasted like a sweet cough medicine. I don't recommend it but at least it was strong!   We got 2 orders of poutine, one with pork belly nuggets (+$3) and one without. If you like fried, crunchy, fatty pork I say pay the extra charge but I enjoyed it without just the same! This was the whole table's favorite part of the meal! It's so simple but they do it just right. For my main course I got the BP burger- gruyere cheese, bacon, arugula and garlic aioli. It's basically a fancier spin on the classic bacon cheeseburger. Not bad but a little greasy.   I will be coming back here solely for the poutine! *drools"}
{"text":"Had the pretzel bites. Hey we're okay. $4 jamo shots. Good value, nice employees! Bar stays open late.. perfect for a drink after work on the strip!"}
{"text":"The fries were amazing, and so was the pork appetizer. The shrimp and lobster mac and cheese was passable. My gripe was the bellini I asked for was more peach puree than anything else. Couldn't really taste the champagne/prosecco that usually goes in it, and I had to add ice to it because it wasn't cold enough. Moral of the story? Go for the food. Not for the drinks."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and food was pretty tasty. Didn't care too much for the service. She wasn't rude but she wasn't friendly either. The prices were pretty high end but it's probably due to the location of the restaurant from the strip. It might be a cool place to visit at night."}
{"text":"The food was much better the second time I went! I got the carne asada burrito and it was deliciously cooked to perfection. Guac was terrific as were the chips & salsa, as they should be at any Mexican restaurant. The service was slow which is why I'm not giving a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Excellent and reasonably priced!!! Great experience. Try the pork wrap and guacamole! Marks aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service but lately the wait time is outrageously long.  Over an hour for food the last two visits.  Time to hire help of else it might be time to find a new place for Mexican martinis"}
{"text":"Blind Pig has been on my list for awhile and finally tried them twice now. The first time I ordered the BP burger and the second time I had the pastrami or Ruben.  I can't remember from the 2 because honestly was not that memorable. However, my first time I had the BP burger and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best burgers I've ever had. The patty itself was pretty thick and they used a good quality beef which I think makes or breaks a burger. The bacon they used was so thick and crisp, to the point if I dropped it on the floor it would have shattered. I can't remember what the sauce was but I think it was some type of mayo/ayoli. They used arugula for the greens, which I thought was a clever touch. But overall this burger was amazing. If you are a burger fan definitely order this. Both times I was there we ordered the poutine primarily because it's Canadian thing and hard to find anywhere in the U.S. I am not a fan at all, but I guess I could say it was good. The interior of this place can be best described as \"dapper\" with random pig pictures, but they are done tastefully. Service has been great on both visits. If you have ever wondered about this place I definitely do recommend them."}
{"text":"Just got home from eating here. I really wanted to like this place. Menu seemed decent, prices were nice, atmosphere was okay. The avocado bruschetta is little more than guacamole on toast. I had the short rib tacos, the meat was very bland and overcooked. My girlfriend had the shrimp tamales, which she said were too sweet and the sauce was too creamy. To top it all off, I find it in poor taste that the check would be brought out in a book with the Uncle Sal's logo on it. This is yet another one of Scottsdale's finest tourist trap restaurants that is not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We had our items delivered by Postmates and the food was still piping hot.  If you try anything here it MUST be the Pig Wings.  It's like a giant 1/4lb \"chicken\" wing - mostly meat on one bone.  It came glazed in a chipotle sauce that was nicely charred on a grill with a cilantro ranch dipping sauce.  Lip smackin' good!!  Then we had White Cheddar Mac & Cheese, Adobo Braised Short Rib, Al Pastor Tacos and Key Lime Pie.  It was all amazing except then taco I would give it a 3.  Everything else was so tasty once I had the taco, it was just not up to par with everything else.  I'm excited to come back to try some other items on the menu, and have more Pig Wings of course!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!!!  The food is fresh and delicious.  The omelettes are light and fluffy.  The hash browns are real potatoes cooked to perfection.  You need to come here!  Get off the strip and come for breakfast.  Our waiter Cameron was awesome!!"}
{"text":"We had Nadia as our server and she was so welcoming and wonderful. The food was delicious, served quickly, and large portions. Bring your appetite. And the cocktails are out of this world delicious. I highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Taking a roadtrip and of course Yelped this place. The Blind Pig is the place to dine if in Scottsdale, Arizona. We ordered two shrimp tamales, pulled pork sandwich and their guacamole chips it was all delicious. The server and atmosphere were great. Will be returning."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch yesterday, and I didn't even know Panorama had a little strip mall in front of it. Shows you how often I come by here these days.  Food was OK, service was painfully slow. I came in and told the girl behind the bar how hungry I was, yet we had trouble flagging her down to order. After ordering (two sandwiches), it took forevvvvver for the food to arrive. And they were NOT busy.  Prices are pretty decent, as we paid $10 each for a sandwich with a side salad (as a substitute for french fries). Menu is pretty expansive, too. Might have to come back and try something else and see if the service is better."}
{"text":"Thr food is descent, but i feel like it is over priced for the small portions. The entree was $14, but I am leaving hungry. My wife's entree was $12, but small enough that our 11 month old daughter at most of the meal."}
{"text":"We went for the first time over the weekend and will definitely go back.  The service was great! They suggested an item from each menu category. We loved loved loved the food!!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for a quick lunch - had mixed opinions.  I like the ambiance/vibe of the place and that they have a grab-and-go area full of pre-made food, including deli items like potato salad. Everything seems quite pricy though, so value proposition is definitely suspect.  As for our dine-in lunch, food was hit or miss. My kale salad was excellent. Friend's BP burger (ordered medium well) was severely undercooked. French dip sandwich was just meh, especially as the dip was pretty bland. Seared ahi tuna on the corresponding salad was not good - not sure if the tuna wasn't fresh or just poor quality. I didn't try the BBQ pulled pork sandwich but my friend said it was good. Orzo salad had really good texture but was painfully salty.  I get that cocktails are done in speakeasy style (hence the name of the establishment, I guess) but even for speakeasy style they seemed too sweet and overdone.  Service was OK, but definitely indifferent.  This seems like a spot that might be good for quick eats if you're in the area and don't want to head to the Strip, but you probably have to know what's good on the menu to make it worthwhile. I'm not sure I'd come again - if I do, I'll try more stuff and update this review, but this place is def closer to a 2* than a 4*."}
{"text":"Visiting old Scottsdale and found this place on Yelp. Decided to try based on menu and reviews. Took my son while he was visiting. We loved it, food absolutely delicious. Shrimp tamales, oyster Rockefellers and avocado bruschetta was ordered. What made our taste buds so happy was our starting dish the avocado bruschetta.  It was piled high with avocado, tomatoes, seasonings wow it was so good if you like avocados. Everything reasonably priced too. We noticed that the staff have a great rapport with their regular customers. Great find, will definitely go back to this little place tucked away."}
{"text":"Just had the BBQ chicken pizza and was really good! Tried the chicken wings as well. All was excellent! Want to try the burgers next. It was cool to see some of the things we can only find at Whole Foods on the shelves like the Raincoast Crisps. Love those crackers! Got a black and white cookie to try the bakery side of the restaurant. Most places don't make the desserts in house much anymore. But with all the great bakeries in town, I don't blame them!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's all about the people.  The mural was pretty impeccable, too.  Not a Speak Easy, more like a loud roar.  Hopefully they realize how important the staff on the front lines is."}
{"text":"I'm a Texan that's used to Tex-Mex, AMAZING SERVICE and delicious dishes! Very big portion of nachos and fresh Mahi mahi tacos are to die for. Mexican martini was great to relax a little. Definitely looking to become a regular here."}
{"text":"The lemon chicken is fantastic! Their calzone is amazing The ambience is cozy. It is located near The Strip so it's less crazy. The people are friendly and accommodating, as well. Definitely try to eat here when you come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you look at my reviews, you will see I'm kinda stingy with my 5 stars but, this neighborhood spot deserves it. Our server, Amy told us to take any seat on the patio. As soon as we did, the sprinklers went on soaking the table (no food yet) but, enough for Amy to offer a free round of drinks.   The food was wonderful. We got short ribs, shrimp tamale, and a quesadilla dish. All were excellent.   Comfortable place, good service, great food, reasonable prices. Can't beat that combo"}
{"text":"Great food all around.  Beautiful lounge. Perfect energy level.  Wonderful staff.  The Reuben was phenomenal and they have beer of the week for $5.   Excellent happy hour too.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from Texas and we were looking for a good true Mexican restaurant. The spare rib tacos and fish tacos were incredible. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! So happy to have it in the area...menu looks odd but haven't had a bad item, they know what they're doing. Mahi tacos are the best I've had in Phoenix area. Huge selection of meat (including frog legs) you can pick up for purchase also."}
{"text":"We ventured in on Friday night around 7:30 and had no problem getting a sweet booth. Hope the secret doesn't get out!   Apparently they just started a happy hour...ends at 7, so we missed out.   We tried some fancy cocktails. Around $10 each. Tasty. I had a ginger something. It was, indeed, gingery.   We shared pork belly nuggets, meatballs and shrimp and lobster Mac and cheese. Nuggets were A-OK. They tasted too much like a bottle of sweet chili sauce for my liking. Meatballs were tender and very flavorful. Mac and cheese was spot on - deeeelish! Creamy, dreamy and generous on the shrimp and lobster. We finished with the ultra decadent layered chocolate hazelnut dessert with salty crunchy bits and a anchor steam. Pure bliss.   For being so hip and swanky, I thought the portions and prices were quite reasonable. We felt cool just being there for sure. Definitely a fun spot to take visitors for some off the beaten path swank. We also had our 2 year old in tow which was no problem at all.   Service was very attentive and nice. We will def go back. I'd like to try their brunch for sure!"}
{"text":"This gastropub is located off the freeway in Las Vegas in a business district. Stopped in after a quick check of restaurants in the area.  Greeted promptly by staff, directed to a table, menus provided and beverage order offered to be taken. The waitress was cordial, personable, and attentive. We had several questions and requests to which she was able to accommodate.   We ordered the pork nuggets, poutine, and I ordered a BP burger. The food came out at a good pace from appetizer to meal.   The poutine was a nice balance of gravy, cheese and beer battered French fries. Not salty and not soggy was the poutine.   Pork nuggets seasoned and topped with peanuts in a sweet thai style sauce along with a nice dipping aioli. The pork belly used for the nuggets were tender and not fatty. The combination of dip, seasoning, and likes sound like they wouldn't mesh well.  Surprisingly it was worth.   The BP Burger I requested in medium was topped with arugula, cheese, tomato on nice soft roll. Choice of fries, salad, or upgrade to sweet potato. I elected the regular fries.   Burger was cooked as requested. Appropriately seasoned to the accompaniments. Cooked correctly. Juicy and flavorful. Fries were beer battered. Good on their own and or with some ketchup.  Others in my group ordered the au jus. From what I gathered it was good. Not the best. Needed more horseradish. Made daily. Wasn't the spiciest. The au jus was a good sweetness and juiciness for the meat. Not overly salty. The crunch roll was just right for the hearty amount of tender beef.   Bill settlement was quick and to the point.   Good: execution on the point of food. Most things are made as ordered. Inexpensive and great value compared to the area.  Bad: Just wish it was closer to the action of Vegas.  Other notes: weird bathroom napkin dispenser.   Would visit again."}
{"text":"Ooh this place is so un-Vegas and I love that about it. First of all, it's in the bottom of the Panorama towers. Location is ok because it's by the strip, but not subject to the parking and walking issues of LV Blvd. Walking up, it almost feels like you're in a regular city! Would be a bonus if it were on a high floor, to get a view. There are two sides: the restaurant/bar side, and a fast/takeout side. It was pretty late when we arrived so the takeout side was already closed.  We sat at the bar where the 'tender was friendly enough, but realized that we were in conversation and pretty much left us alone. The specialty cocktail list is pretty good, with vodka, gin, rum, whiskey and tequila drinks. Each is $10, so I think that's a pretty good 'specialty' price. The beer list has some interesting gems on it, with costs from $5-15. Plus points for having a 'draft brew of the week' for $5 each. I confess that I didn't try the food yet, but I just loved the atmosphere and concept so much that I really want to return. And I want it to survive, which seems like it might be difficult in this location. I hope it does! Oh yeah and I almost forgot to mention that kids are totally welcome here!"}
{"text":"Just okay for now...  Restaurant, Ambiance, and Location:  4 Stars Service:  More like 2.5 Stars, but I will round up to 3. Food Selection / Taste:  3 Stars  Price:  3 Stars ($50 for a two salads and two meals)  We arrived for a quick dinner before a show.  My only knowledge of the Blind Pig was from other Yelpers check-in's.  My experience wasn't tainted because I haven't read any of the reviews.  In other words, I came here \"blind\".  Service was a little less than average, but it's all about the food and drinks, right?  I got the BP Burger and requested it to be prepared medium-well.  I took a bite and realized it was more medium than medium-well.  I didn't complain because the burger was actually pretty good.  Complimenting my burger was a ton of sweet potato fries that were just okay.  I also got to taste my gf's Shrimp & Lobster Mac.  I could tell just by looking at the Mac that it was lacking a little taste.  In my opinion, their Shrimp & Lobster Mac can use a little more shrimp, lobster, cheese, and mac.    Overall, I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of the Blind Pig.  Ambiance is cool, their burger is pretty good, the service can be better, and the shrimp & lobster mac can use some work.  For now, they are just okay."}
{"text":"Antipasto salad was delicious... no dressing needed as the vegetables are well marinated and bursting with flavor.    Wine by the glass is limited and they changed their wine by the bottle list..  not over impressed, but the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Love the menu here.  It's comfort food central.  They have solid drinks and a good staff.  Some of the drinks are a little wonky, so choose carefully."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I've been in the valley for over 30 years and they are at the top of my favorites. Overall, great food, excellent service with food made from fresh ingredients.  During my first visit a few weeks ago, we ordered the crab dip appetizer with avocado that exceed our expectations. The portion of crab was very generous.   I had the short ribs with the house rice. The house rice has some secret in ingredients to include small chunks of pineapple and surprisingly was crazy good with the short ribs. I craved the shorts ribs all week and went back the next week.   The margs are classic and good at a very reasonable price.  This place is a must try, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"This a cute little bar/gourmet to-go lunch spot that is in the bottom of Panorama Towers.  Kind of has a 1920's speakeasy vibe.  As much as my group enjoyed the d√©cor, we were not sold on the food and drinks we ordered.  The Swedish Ginger I ordered was a tasty take on a Moscow Mule, but the drinks my friends ordered were basically the size of a shot and way too sweet.  For $12 a pop, the drink better be good.   Our server was very friendly.  Service was attentive, too attentive, in fact.  I always feel like such a jerk when I get annoyed at being checked on every 5 minutes, but you know what I mean.  If you ask someone 3 times if they are okay after finishing dinner and they always say YES!, you really do not need to ask a 4th time.  All told, nothing I had would make me venture this close to the strip, but if you're in the neighborhood, it might be worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!! The guacamole was chunky and the perfect balance of ingredients. Both the red and green salsa was equally amazing! The pork wings were one of a kind and a signature appetizer! The short ribs over house rice was delicious and delectable! The shrimp tamale was delightful and heavenly! This place is traditional Mexican food with a twist. The service was is very personal and informative. Taneal was a great server, sweet and irreplaceable!!! If your in Scottsdale you must eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited: On a Friday at 12 PM for a lunch meeting  Service: 5.0 out of 5.0 Our server Nicole was very friendly and sat us outside as we requested.  She would stop by frequently to check on us, even after the food was served.  A work colleague of mine split an enormous Salmon Panini and they served it to us as two separate entrees.  We really appreciated them doing that for us.  See pics   Value: 3.0 out of 5.0 Our crew's breakdown: $9.99 = Grilled Ham/Cheese or Turkey Club Sandwich.  Both came with a side salad.  The monster sized salmon panini was $11.99 and easily fed two. Bruschetta was at $7.99 and bottomless drinks at $3.00  Food: 4.0 out of 5.0.  I can speak only on behalf of the Salmon Panini which was tasty and a large portion.  The Honey Mustard dressing was amazing.  I should have asked if that was made in-house or purchased.  Very tasty  Ambiance: We sat outside this visit as the weather was nice but we've eaten inside and the booths are spacious and comfortable.  The tables are spaced appropriately and there are flat screens to watch sporting events.  The bar looks well stocked with high end booze and craft beers.  Looks like a great place to stop by for happy hour.    Summary:  We've stopped by there for lunch 3 times and all visits resulted in a good lunch that got us out quickly.  Food and staff have always been solid and I'll have to visit for dinner and happy hour one day."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly.  Great happy hour I love the bresecetta  I've eaten here several times and I love it"}
{"text":"My friends ordered two pizzas as appetizers for our large group. Meh, 'bar' level pizza at best. Not horrible, but even with the meat toppings it was bland and the dough was more closely related to bread dough than actual pizza dough.  I ordered the 'secret menu' pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. There was nothing great about the sandwich, however, the BBQ sauce had a lot of sugar in it or maybe not enough vinegar. Hard to say. The highlight was the perfectly done sweet potato fries. $18.50 total.  My wife ordered the fried chicken plate with fries substituted for the mash. The chicken looked good, wasn't sitting a puddle of grease. However, it was just three pieces for $18. I asked my wife what she thought and she said it was good, but not $18's good.  Drinks were priced slightly hire than other places, but not terrible so. i.e. $7 for a pint of Bass ale.  Overall, it was just an OK meal. Two things that would bring me back was the atmosphere and the service, definite thumbs up there, however that really doesn't warrant me making a trip there. I'm sure this place is a life saver for those who reside in the towers and probably the main vein of their revenue."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and I really like all the pasta dishes and salads.  You pretty much can't go wrong with those.  I wasn't a fan of the Italian Beef sandwich but that's the only thing I've tried and didn't care for.  Has an upscale sports bar atmosphere.  Staff is always fast and friendly at lunch when I am there."}
{"text":"Great service.  Everyone here is friendly. The food is delicious! I had the lobster mac & cheese and my friend had the shrimp and lobster roll which both were amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic waitress. Nice lightning and color scheme in this place. Worth trying and worth returning."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a good margarita and great service check out this little gem tucked away on n Hayden next to its sister restaurant Uncle Sals . The Cadillac margarita Is served in a pint glass and will make you forget it's Monday . The bartender Raul is a rockstar . Every time we pull up to the bar he greets us with a warm welcome and remembers what we drink. He's funny and attentive and half the reason we go . Great man . As for the food the Shrimp tamale is a revolution . It is so good when I had family in town from my I brought them right here to try them . All they could talk about the rest of the trip and still is how incredible the shrimp tamales were . You have to check this place out !"}
{"text":"Great service. Place was almost full but we got food and drinks quickly. Braised beef and Mahi Tacos were delicious. Prices were very reasonable. We would come back again."}
{"text":"The pig wings were fantastic.  This is really more of a lunch spot.  They have more salads and sandwiches ( tortas).  Good tacos.  Everything is a la carte.  Didn't do it for me.  The short ribs were not that great."}
{"text":"Pros: shrimp tamales  Cons:  wait time over an hour, food was overcooked, service was SLOW.............. And not friendly staff   Read the other reviews.  Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"On any given night, the brain cells at this bar are less than your average Sandra Lee groupie.   Jager or Patron shots. (Don't you dare ask for anything too fancy). Shitty beer served in plastic cups. Signs warning the meatheads and hooknasties that it's ok to stand on the tables, just not the couches. A dank basement that smells of urine and semen.    Now that I've painted a picture of the mess that is The Blind Pig, I'm still at a loss in understanding how a place like this stays shoulder to Ed Hardy shoulder packed each and every weekend? Is there really a market for this? As evidenced on a recent birthday party, apparently there is an appeal for a gathering place such as this. The basic premise of The Blind Pig is to pack in as many people as humanly possible with Tourette's inducing strobe lights for ambiance and crappy music at ear bleeding decibels for entertainment. Not my idea of fun, but to each his/her own."}
{"text":"There was an old guy offending my girlfriend and I told him to stop and the bar tender sits there and let's him degrade my girlfriend in front of mt girl. His name is Erin and he sits there and kicks me out as I'm eating dinner. Honestly I will never eat here ever. If you are a female or with a female I would suggest to stay away from this business as they are okay with threatening females and do not protect any one in favor of the old disgusting men that haunt this business. The old man at the bar stated the females would suck his \"blank\" and the bartenders laughed. At this point I called 911 at the situation was getting out of my hands and I did not feel safe in the business. I will be filing a complaint with the FCC and also The bbb that the business allows the customers to be threatened.  Managers name that kicked me out was Tom and also the bartender that defended the old disgusting man that called the girls a cock sucking whole Erin. I will be also keeping up to get this business corrected as I personally own multiple businesses in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Got the mushroom quesadilla and Chicken taquitos. Both were amazing and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Bug serving and good food..it was too salty for me but my husband like it salty so it was all good!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I'm not a fan of Southwestern food. For those who are, I highly recommend. Whoever is in the kitchen, enjoys flavors. The guacamole is really fresh with a perfect kick, and a must try is the avocado and tomato bruschetta. #1 choice on the menu. Pictured are the double bacon BLT, and the crispy taquitos. More importantly, they have great music on Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"The five star rating I gave here solely based on one  of my favorite food, calamari linguine marinara!! That was absolutely out of this world!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Staff is friendly. The bartender Raul is amazing. Every server is awesome! The shrimp tamale rocked. The chips, guacamole and salsa are fresh and homemade. When rolling through Scottsdale to look at Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesen, one must stop here for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken ciabatta sandwich and it's absolutely excellent. The bread is soft but firm around the edges and the chicken was juicy but charred well. Great To-go order."}
{"text":"Extremely annoying to arrive at the restaurant only to find them closed. Inconsiderate to have the wrong hours listed on their website - and their front door!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Tamales are so good. The Chicken Poblano special was also great! Salsa tasted like made in house, both kinds! Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was ready to rave about this joint until my food came out-- Rueben on GF pressed, only my Rueben wasn't pressed, and when I reminded homegirl that I asked that it be pressed and that cross-contamination weren't no thang to me, she just came back with, \"Yeah, he said he won't press it.\"  I mean, she wasn't just deadpan about it; she was pleading with her eyes for me not to make a big deal, and it made me wonder about the workplace culture. Later, checkin' in on me, she asks how things are and I tell her straight I'm still trying to figure out why her man decides how I eat my sandwich. She can tell I'm pissed, and homegirl was super apologetic, but again-- to what end? She comps me a drink and apologizes all over the place, but that's not what I asked for. And what I did ask for was apparently wholly outside the realm of possibility?  I steamed on this one for months (my visit was in November), and I don't care to speculate about homie's motives. This joint has all the right elements, but somebody's throwin' weight in that kitchen, and it ain't in the interest of customers."}
{"text":"Again this was recommended from the bartender at the Barrymore.   We were excited to visit once we saw the menu. It was during ConExpo and we had clients with us from NYC. Luckily we cabbed it over *never ever drink and drive in Vegas!* because there was zero parking in front.   You enter though the \"deli\" section of the restaurant - more on that later and then off to the side is the bar/restaurant portion.   Total Fail: the seating is awful. The choices are tables with tiny armed seating OR squished booths. 2 people of our party were well over 6'5\" and the booths just didn't work. The only waitress in the place was either clueless or had never seen tall or chubby folks before because when asked if they had armless chair she just shrugged and walked away to continue the chat we interrupted upon entering. The bar would have been an option but there weren't 4 seats together. We solved our issue by - wait for it. Removing the extremely large table from the booth and replacing it with the smaller but more accessible table from the center.   Not one person stopped us.   So NOT fatubulous!   The ambiance:  trying to ignore the above issues, it's a very pleasant looking space. I mean when you over look the interstate running right outside, you get a nice view of the backside of Harmon tower before it falls down.   The Drinks: Short. and expensive. *see attached photos of the bloody mary* - we had 3 rounds x 4 - $138.00   The Food: We just ordered appetizers since our waitress was basically non-existent so busy flipping her hair that one of our group actually had to go to the bar to order another round of drinks & get food menus.   Pork Nuggets: genius! Perfection. (3 orders)   Meatballs:  all were good but it would have been nice to know which ones were which.. pork/chicken/veal - all slathered in a tasty sauce but couldn't tell the difference in the meats. It could have been 80% beef and I wouldn't know because the sauce made them delicious. (3 orders)   Chicken Wings:   The only thing I'm going to say about this is that it was an ample serving. After the 1st one we packed them up to go. They tasted much better cold.   Service: There were 2 bright spots in the service: 1 was the 'busboy' who brought out our meatballs & was willing to at least ask the chef which was which. (and turns out, couldn't determine that either)  & the counter girl in the provisions section. She was extremely nice & helpful when we were leaving.   Otherwise it was a total fail. The one waitress working was attached by an invisible bungee cord to the end of the bar where she was animated & giggling at every word the 2 guys seated there & the bartender said. On the few occasions when she bothered to come over - she was surly and downright rude. I mean how dare we interrupt her social swish.   Total bill:  3 rounds of drinks & appetizers 219.00. *and yes we left standard tip just to show we are better than her service*   It's really too bad as we have a friend to lives next door in the Martin and it would be a great spot to meet up for lunch or cocktail hour.  He too is 6'6\" and quite frankly wouldn't be bothered trying to fold himself into the booths/chairs currently available.   Of the Block 16 places we've tried (and you can read our reviews of LBS, Holsteins, Barrymore, and Pinks etc) this is a huge disappointment for us. As a local, I'd never go there again. Can it be sustained on just the tenants of the Panorama & Martin? Maybe. Time will tell."}
{"text":"This was definitely a gem in Las Vegas. It is locally very close, yet a little ways away from the hustle and bustle off the Las Vegas Strip.  I feel like this location is ideal for patrons who live in the Panorama Towers or the locals who know all the amazingly delicious secret spots. Lol. The food here is fantastic! We got the Pastrami Reuben and the Shrimp and Lobster Roll sandwich. Superb! The atmosphere is great--cosmopolitan and swanky. The servers here are quick and the service is great.  This is definitely a great spot to grab a quick bite for lunch, and even a great spot to start the evening with Happy Hour! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and nice staff.  Its a little pricey but you get what you pay for.  Well worth the trip and I recommend one of the pizza's."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig is a hidden gem just off the strip in Vegas.  I was in Vegas for work staying nearby for a little over a month and ate here 4 times.  The food is excellent!!!  The mozzarella wedges and the calamari are musts as far as appetizers go.  Both are hand breaded and not overly fried.  Also, the homemade marinara sauce they serve with both of those apps is really good, probably some of the best I've had.  For entrees, the stuffed shells, the eggplant rigatoni, and the shrimp fricase are all excellent choices!!!  Their menu has many other options besides pasta, I'm just a pasta lover!  I think they also have pizza, sandwiches, burgers, and even steaks!  The best part about The Blind Pig is one of the waitresses, Amy!!!  She's so sweet and attentive and she offers great recommendations!!!  If you want a good meal and drinks away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, give The Blind Pig a try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner tonight, loved the decor and atmosphere. Had the crispy pork nuggets and shrimp and lobster sandwich and they were delicious!!!! Great happy hour menu too!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch.   It was quiet & quaint! We ordered the (very large) queso fundido with chips. It was delicious. Then we ordered 1 each of all 5 tacos. The braised short rib is amazing. The carne asada, chicken & pastor were great. The fish wasn't my favorite, but the hubs devoured it. The drinks are very good (Paloma fresca & the Ultimat orange crush). Raul (who has worked for the company for 18 yrs) is awesome. He made us a sample of his pineapple margarita that isn't on the menu. Delish. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, ate here for lunch and can't say enough. Flavors explode off your palate. Recommend; pork wings, smothered baked potato and the to die for shrimp tamale."}
{"text":"Returned to introduce my family to pork belly heaven. Unfortunately they've decided to redo the menu and restaurant. Pork belly and the secret menu were nicked.   Food selections and quality are still really good.   Sitting here waiting for our food overhearing the wait staff talking about a dream they had about being a sex slave....  It IS Vegas tho...."}
{"text":"Flesh ingredients used to prepare delicious good eats. Off the beaten path of the strip. Well stocked bar with crafty, friendly staff mixing up well balanced cocktails. A must for visitors and locals alike."}
{"text":"Would recommend taking a taxi or driving to this location. Walking is not easy and is a little sketchy.  The drinks were ok, we had one really good one and two not so great. But they definitely get points for trying to be creative. The Tom Collins with the basil simple syrup was the best.  We went for the prime rib special they offer on Saturdays. We didn't have a reservation and since it was fight night we had to sit outside since nearly every table inside was reserved. The waitress didn't really seem to know the menu very well. The special said it came with a salad, potato, and saut√©ed spinach.   The prime rib was flavorful, but almost too flavorful - I was instantly skeptical. I think they saut√©ed it in a pan with some seasonings because it was still cold.   All in all we thought the experience was fine...until I woke up the next morning. Severe gastrointestinal distress - I'll just leave it at that.   Won't be going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"don't know why I still come here. I think because they're open late and that's pretty much about it. The bf ordered a steak and because of the previous experience he orders with light salt and it was still salty!!  He ordered t medium and I was completely well done. The service is getting worse and the Alfredo now taste like it's from a bottle. Very inconsistent and I have to say it's getting worse. After complaining about the medium steak there was no effort to correct the problem. Just a meer \" oh um you want another one then?\"  Really??"}
{"text":"Wow resteraunt used to be good till they Renovated now the service sucks we went for lunch we asked for service and the waitress said Rudley can you wait I am busy as she sat at the booth flirting with a customer . Then she came and got our drink order ice tea and water and took our order after an hour we never got any service she said sorry we were slammed . You will get your food when the kitchen has it ready it was a salad we ordered can you believe the lousy service . We left never going back ever again that's how you put your business out of business no customer service !! We spoke to the manager he said come back I will buy you lunch next time  , really who would go back with lousy service !!!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving a bad based on one bad experience, so I will try to be as positive as I can.  Blind Pig is a cute lounge/bar/cafe in a weird part of town (too far from the strip for tourists, too out of the way for locals). It seems like a good chunk of their customers come from the high rise next door.  Parking was not a problem when we went (Sunday 7PM), however I can see it being a problem if they were busier. The Blind Pig is NOT in the high rise next door, don't accidentally drive into their lot!  You get a free cocktail/coffee/smoothie with Yelp check in (Sorry, no beer). However, we were told that they were in the process of \"changing their cocktail menu,\" thus didn't have the ingredients to make any of the cocktails on the menu. We asked if we could substitute it for a beer- told no, asked if they could make us a cocktail with whatever ingredients they had- told no. Hope that issues been resolved! We ordered the white sauce pizza- really, really good! The poutine portion was HUGE for the price. It was perfect big group food!  I would come back, but it's just so out of the way......"}
{"text":"Easy to find ! It's right in front of the panorama towers ! When you go inside, the decor is very nice and simple ! We sat in a booth and the server was awesome ! Great service and attentive ! Would definitely come back if I need a place for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Just wanted to add this:  we are staying at Vdara and had a hard time figuring out if we could walk here.  Yes!  Take Harmon over the freeway and you will see the two towers on your left.  Cross the street and walk on the side of the building to the front entrance.  You may be able to see the Blind Pig sign from you room or the overpass.  Not sure if anyone else has problems with Google Maps, but ours was wrong so I wasn't even looking for the sign.  Hope this is helpful!"}
{"text":"Found this via yelp reviews and what a great find. Sat right down on a Saturday afternoon. It is located right off the freeway and very convenient. Atmosphere is family friendly, fully stocked bar and a number of beers in bottle.   We shared the urtha-za pizza and it was spectacular.   This is a great restaurant all the way around. If you are passing through or a local try this place out."}
{"text":"Our second meal was a wonderful as the first. I heartily recommend the crab tower (with guacamole and mango. Key Lime Pie is made in the restaurant and well-worth the calories."}
{"text":"3rd time coming (from out of town), twice for work, and each time is better than the next. Excellent food and service and fantastic happy hour prices. Our entire party was very pleased. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great Place! I was visiting a friend who lives at the nearby Panorama tower. If I lived at Panorama I would probably cater a party at my place from Blind Pig. Blind Pig even delivers to Panorama! Happy hour 4-6 PM and 11PM-2AM for half price appetizers (dine-in only).  We started off with the complimentary bread and melted butter. Yum! Taco Tuesday offers steak, chicken or shrimp tacos. We had one of each. We also ordered Calamari which comes with a very thick Marinara like sauce that is nothing like I ever had. Delicious! Barbecue wings and pretzel bites are also great. Our server Amy was super nice and helpful. When I am nearby I will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Ehhh. this place was Ehhh the staff was very unknowledgeable, service was poor, brew selection subpar. If you're visiting Vegas go somewhere else but if you've eaten everything else I guess try this place"}
{"text":"If you need a luncheon catered and done right.....CALL THE BLING PIG NOW!!!!  You guys rock!!  I used your services for the 1st time to cater my company's lunch.  Great food, great service, and excellent quality!!!  The staff is very friendly, portions are great and you can't be the price!  Thank you for making me look good and my Company's lunch a success!!!  We will call again soon ;)"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, felt like a fancier Pub. Bar staff was nice and attentive. Food was good but a bit overpriced for what it was. Don't get me to be cheap, cause I will spend a pretty penny on all things FOOD!!   -Tuna fish with cucumbers, avocado, puffed rice was amazing! Two sauces complemented the dish, fresh tuna, fresh taste all around!  -onion rings.... They're onion rings. Good but nothing special -meatballs were good, a slight bit room temp but good non the less.  -chopped salad (although it wasn't my order, I still took bites!) was yummy.... Different than most chopped salads but very good!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it was OK. Not amazing, but not bad either. Food was solid. We had the poutine, grilled cheese, and the pulled pork sandwich. My pulled pork sandwich was luke warm but had a good flavor. Cocktails were a little too sweet. Atmosphere is ok, music was almost too quiet, the restaurant was basically empty at 6:30pm (a red flag?) and it felt a little uncomfortable to talk for fear of disturbing the one other table of people there. Probably won't go back just because Vegas has so many other tastier options to choose from."}
{"text":"A beautiful little bar/lounge just off the Strip. The food is fantastic! And service is friendly and prompt. Try the crispy pork belly nuggets or any of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you don't even want to post a review about because you don't want to share the wonderfulness with everyone else. Amazing service, even more amazing food every time. I love you Blind Pig."}
{"text":"My go to spot for when I want to have a great meal and not spend a ton of money. The pig wings, el pastor tacos, and pretty much every ingredient used at this small casual restaurant are incredible."}
{"text":"This place was highly overrated. We came here as a stop on our way out of town- the food was average at best. It took forever to get our food and it was very bland. It wasn't inedible but it was definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"Not much too add I said before this place is amazing, but they did expand and it was at the expense of removing the butcher out of the building. I was a little bummed but understand business. The good and service still rocks."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Phenomenally friendly staff (but not overly so) Awesome decor Delicious food (I waited to draft this review until after trying a few of their dishes)  Convenient for me (live in the building behind it)  Smoothie bar with healthy smoothies Grocery store with essentials  Seems a bit on the pricy side but still very worth it. Easily going to be here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"Best hidden gem in Old Town.  Great patio, wonderful staff and delicious food.  They pour a nice size glass of wine and the small water feature creates a pleasant atmosphere.  Wide variety on the menu and always have great specials.  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"There was zero parking out front in a very small lot, but there was only a few tables dining in the restaurant.  That means the staff is taking all the parking out front.  You have to park at the UFC gym about 200 feet South of the restaurant .  They say the UFC gym allows the Blind Pig to use their lot, but that's just the restaurant saying it.   The food is good for the price, but  I know why the name is Blind Pig. It's because all the pork items on the menu were not available.  What Up with that?  I won't go back because they have no parking and I wouldn't want my car towed or ticketed at the UFC Gym.   i don't think this new place will survive without solving a parking issue."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I will be back here next week. Maybe even tomorrow. My family of four came to eat dinner here. First impression is it is quaint and contains Kobe beef meat shop inside (yummm). We chose to sit outside because it was nice out. There is a water fixture that adds to the ambiance. Our waiter was super nice and the food came so fast. We ordered some chips with salsa and guac. Great chunks of avocado and the salsa was addicting (the green was had a nice kick to it). I ordered the combo of two tacos and a side of beans or rice. I chose the al pastor and the el pollo and a side of beans. I don't even know where to begin! The chicken taco had great flavor but the al pastor was to die for. It was perfectly cooked with complimentary toppings like pineapple that just burst with flavor. The beans were probably the best flavored refried beans I have ever had and it was a large portion! With the four of us having full meals and an appetizer we only spent 42 dollars. What a great place! I will be back very soon :)"}
{"text":"Badass tacos and fundido. They have it all - drinks, foods, cute waitresses. The food is good quality, tasty & fresh. Good service, quick, good drinks. Go there and do stuff."}
{"text":"Met some friends for breakfast on Sunday morning on 09/17/17 around 9am. Our waitress was a middle aged dark haired woman with a bad attitude and was rude to us. The restaurant was not busy and she only had 3 tables and had a helper so not sure if our waitress was new and in training . Her helper was the one that was nice to us though.  My friend has a severe seafood allergy and was asking the waitress if there was any cross contamination with the grill, spatulas etc. The rude waitress commented in her smart aleck attitude \" our breakfast is not cooked in seafood!\" and just laughed about it. Well severe food allergies that send you to the hospital are a serious matter! That's nothing to laugh about!  My friend ordered a mimosa and the rude waitress said \" I can't make that because our bartender is not here\" then she decided to bring it after all. Seriously it's not rocket science to pour some champagne in some OJ. I had asked for my Oj again that she forgot to bring and she rudely said \"When I catch up with everything then I'll bring it!\" I ordered eggs with hash browns because that's what it says in the menu. She rudely said \"We don't have hash browns, we have potatoes!\" ... well then it should not say hash browns in the menu! She could have said nicely \" I'm sorry we don't have hash browns today but would you like potatoes instead?\" Seriously this waitress needs to go back in training and learn how to give good customer service and leave the sour attitude at home! Not impressed with the food. The potatoes tasted old and microwaved and so did the burnt bacon. She never even brought us butter and jam for our dry toast. She did not even ask how everything was. The only reason why I left a tip was because I felt bad for the nice young lady that was helping her. Not impressed at all! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Lots of good stuff on the menu. The turkey club is amazing. A little bit pricey for your average lunch spot so you might only want to go on payday"}
{"text":"Nice room. Patio is in the shade most of the afternoon. Service is excellent. A bit pricey though. Pork belly is not as good as advertised. But the calamari and quesadilla during HH are very good."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to try the Shrimp Tamale! Best sweet and salty combination. 5 stars to Raul our waiter! We'll be back for sure next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Service was good. I went with a friend out of town. We had the spinach & artichoke dip that lacked flavor. We ended up adding salt and pepper to taste. I ordered the steak sandwich and only thing I would change about that is that the bread was entirely too hard. My friend had a burger and it was over cooked. All in our experience was fair. However I Wouldn't go back or suggest to friends who come to visit."}
{"text":"Wow, Everything tasty and Fresh. Wings, baked clams, mussels, Steak sandwiches, pretty damn good w/Fresh bread. Great service. All of us happy, pleased and satisfied. IF YOUR NICE, You'll  ATTRACT the same friendly engaging staff, as we did!  Will be back with my crew, good wholesome food. Parking is another story, very small lot. Don't be lazy, park elsewhere and walk, everyone could use more exercise, A challenge for potheads.lol"}
{"text":"I just really love what this place is all about , good food, drinks and atmosphere and just genius with the market set up on the other side. We will frequent this place a lot and it has a nice view of the strip without being on the strip. Love it !!"}
{"text":"Holy Shnikeys! Idk wtf happened but this place went from top of the line to bottom of the barrel  What a disappointment - ordered 2 items I've ordered in the past - steak sandwich & a burger & both were horrendous! The burger literally had a generic store bought bun that I wouldn't even use if I was BBQ'ing burgers - top bun didn't fit & bottom bun was non- existent. The steak sandwich that I couldn't quit raving about before is now a greasy mess loaded with green peppers - not even reminiscent of the one I had here before. This was more like a bad Philly not to mention both the burger & steak Sammy came wrapped in low budget foil so the cheese on the Sammy was stuck to the foil & the burger was completely smashed. Prior orders came in plastic boxes with see-thru covers & the fries didn't used to come in brown paper bags. SO low budget. We were very excited to order from here since past deliveries were amazing but I won't order here again after this experience. If it was only a little off that'd be forgivable but this was like a diff place entirely!  & here we thought we had a new go to place but much like everything else in Vegas - it's a facade! They trick you by being so great just to pull out the rug from your feet & suck like everywhere else   Good riddance Blind Pig idk if you changed management it just your cooks but you went from a solid A+ to a -F in my book - & it's really too bad cuz you were really great"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the pig wings and the ceviche. I could eat their food everyday. My wife has had their mac and cheese and she really enjoys it. Service is up and down. We have had good service and bad. I think it's just the luck of the draw but their food makes up for any bad service. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for a late night beer and bite. Feels like a nice neighborhood bar in the thick of Las Vegas madness."}
{"text":"My server was Nichol...she was great to be around and very helpful with the menu as this is my first time here. The house chopped salad was top of the line, and the lasagna was delicious....just a bit to cheesy....id recommend a lil less cheese and a lil more marinara. I would also recommend bigger wine glasses so that the wine can breath, because the other ones are to small and the waitresses fill them to the top and even hit the bottle on the glass  (constructive criticism). Other then that....I really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and I'll be back again. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Food is outstanding and the ambiance is hip but comfy. Pork nuggets and gravy fries are a must. Wash it down with a cold beer or one of their custom cocktails. **UPDATE from 3/15/17....New owners and the place has completely fallen apart. Took like an hour to get out order and it was the WRONG thing. They have some heavier set red haired lady behind the bat who has no idea how to make drinks OR do any work. Place really had potential but it is a train wreck nowadays."}
{"text":"Alright, so whenever I eat at various restaurants I don't take much into consideration from friends...since everything is based on perspective. With that being said I was recommended to check out the Bling Pig by several friends, so we did.  Upon arriving we find, no parking. Where do you park? Under the overpass, in front...is there any other parking? A few cars were parked in red...we went into Bravo Tickets (business next door) and asked if we could park in one of their spaces, they were nice enough to allow this...but what if they hadn't...where were we to park?  Open seating in a small-ish location, but were comfortable with our choice. Server or manager (blonde lady in white button up) asked if we wanted to combine tables, since there was 5 of us...we declined but thanked her for the offer. We placed our drink order then shortly after we placed our appetizer order:  Pork belly nuggets - amazing Poutine - you can't go wrong with gravy cheese and crinkle cut fries Quesadilla - meh, wasn't impressed...I think I just didn't like the cheese Chicken wings - usual hot sauced wings  We then order our entrees:   Shrimp and lobster macaroni and cheese - incredible Steak frites - great prep, and tasted great  So far so good...right? No, I haven't mentioned the waitress...server...busser...manager...?  Ok, so we have 3 people assisting us...cocktail waitress, whom never asked if we wanted another round. The server...she was hit or mainly miss...we asked 3 times for refills on sodas...my girlfriend ended up going to the bar herself for the refills. Our busser, Michael, was on point. I think maybe he needs a promotion as he helped us more than either of the other 2. Come time for our bill...the server as well as the cocktail waitress are talking in the back by the bar. I raised my had and waved like I was in grade school...nope that didn't get their attention. Luckily Michael had walked by and I asked him for the check, which he was able to break the 2 up from their conversation and the cocktail waitress brought over our check....she collected shortly after. We wait...we wait...we wait....server drops what looked like a check to another table then walked outside...the cocktail waitress was who knows where...10 minutes later i go to the bar and ask the bartender for our checks...he looked confused but wanted to help, looks back then says oh it's right here....seriously? Not his fault by any means, but why didn't the server or the cocktail waitress bring this out?  I would love to go back, but it'll be a last choice if I do. Although one of my friends, whom dined with us, mentioned the bar staff was on point and their service was much better and they were very attentive. So maybe we'll go back and sit at the bar or just ask for Michael to assist us."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and definitely not our last! The chicken nachos were the best we've ever had, My wife loved the fish tacos and I had the stuffed burger; everything was delicious! The service and atmosphere were great and casual!"}
{"text":"(Visited April 26, 2017)  First time here, for both Karen W. and me, and patio seating was enjoyable until our food arrived, and then all of the flies came to investigate.  Mid-dining, I was ready to ask for a table indoors, but it was such a lovely day out, I thought I'd try to ignore the pesky buggers.  The tables were arranged in a circle patio with umbrellas for shade, and there's a quaint water fountain next to it.  The Blind Pig is surrounded by other restaurants owned by the same owner/s: Uncle Sal's and The Side Door.  I seem to recall visiting Uncle Sal's for dinner after work a few years ago.  I'd seen a glimpse of TBP's bar when I went to use the restroom after lunch, and the bar reminds me of Uncle Sal's bar.  I also noticed that TBP's small indoor space is very noisy, and it wasn't even full of people.  I can just imagine how thunderous it must sound on a busy night!  Since I hadn't had a bite to eat (I got up at 10:20 am after five hours' of sleep so that I may get ready in time to meet Karen for lunch at 11 am-- I was a few minutes late), a few things looked interesting to me, so I decided I'd try the Queso Fundido app and the Torta Ahogada, minus the avocado.  The queso fundido came with tortilla chips.  I asked if the server would find out if the kitchen could cook up a batch of flour tortilla chips- I've had a few restaurants succeed in making some for me!- but she said no.  Didn't even try, or feign an attempt to ask.  However, she did offer to bring flour tortillas, which arrived barely warmed.  I thought the app was good, but then again, I was very hungry.  I also had more of the chorizo than Karen did, apparently.  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=OpS_5k7LNcMxwa4-_HN9uQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  The torta ahogada was just OK-- refried beans, queso fresco, pickled jalape√±os, and red chili sauce atop shredded chicken encased in a bolillo roll. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=edkOfO7TSiYC7sNQZNmn7w&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  This torta did not look appetizing to me, but, as I've written, I was hungry...  I found the roll to be too soft- it could've been grilled or toasted longer, and the refried bean sauce spilling over the top of the bread did not look good at all. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=FNyn9yVqfsjp_Afy0WhJ7g&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Karen W. ordered the \"Pig Wings\" app, which were two small grilled bone-in pork shanks with chipotle glaze. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=nXR9Got3gYlgYQCm3R5bdw&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I tried one and it was OK.  See a pattern here?  I could've eaten more of the piece I had, but I wanted to save room for my app and torta.  She ordered a shrimp entree for her mains, and I did not taste it, as I have seafood/shellfish allergies. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-scottsdale?select=1qM_CI14Py7xO6ncnp0lTQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  She didn't like the fact that the shrimp were swimming in sauce, but she seemed to enjoy the shrimp!  We didn't order dessert, because Karen was full from the apps and her entree and I try to select only desserts made in-house, and The Blind Pig does not offer any (made in-house).  TBP was a many years' old bookmark, and I gave it a try, and that's enough.  I'd say sipping cocktails and other beverages may be a safe bet out on the patio...  Just don't order food, or you'll have flies flocking over you while you eat-- eeks!  p.s.  My glass of water arrived with black particles in it, so I asked for another.  I hoped those flakes were just carbon that managed to escape the filter encasement.  Tasted the water that arrived, and it was bad- Scottsdale water doesn't taste great unless filtered through a \"state-of-the-art\" filtration system, like many of the \"newer\" and higher-end establishments like to boast they use.  I ordered coffee, hoping that the water's bad flavor wouldn't overwhelm the coffee flavor-- the coffee tasted weak.  Save yourself the time and money and get your coffee fix elsewhere.  Also, bring your own bottled water if you're dining in."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family for brunch and was very pleased by the friendly staff and cleanliness of the place. We ordered the meatballs(excellent) pork nuggets (Very tasty) tuna inside out (refreshing)  and that was our appetizer round. The pizzas are packed with flavor no matter which one you choose. The Lobster&Shrimp Mac ? Cheese was creamy and delicious. This is my 5th visit, so I found it fitting for a 5 star review based on every visit. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Got a special at KSHP.  Glad I did because the food was nothing to brag about.  I got a pepperoni calzone.  Now the calzone is my go to menu selection when I'm in the mood for Italian.  Something about this calzone put me off.  There was a chemical taste.  I couldn't tell if it was from the dough or the filling but it was there.  It tasted like something was very processed rather than fresh.  Also, the wait staff, a young lady, was spending more time socializing at the bar than waiting on my table.  I sat for 15min waiting for my check and when I got it I had to wait again for someone to pick it up.  Again, the staff was having fun socializing at the bar, I had to go up to the bar to tell them I was ready to leave. I thought of leaving no review but this experience seemed to linger.  Glad I got this off my chest."}
{"text":"A great bar, butcher, and Mexican restaurant all in one with great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I live right upstairs and come in almost every day, but this weekend seemed to stand out. What a great staff, they always remember you. And food is phenomenal There's a market attached too that delivers to tenants, could use better advertising."}
{"text":"I ordered through EZcater for Happy Hour at work.  Thomas DAntonio delivered it personally.   I placed an order for 60 but he felt I didn't order enough so threw in some extra food.  I ordered all appetizers:  egg rolls, meat balls, veggie tray and mini quiche.  With the exception of the eggrolls, everything was perfect.  I think the eggrolls would have been better if eaten fresh, so that is no fault of theirs.  I will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some old colleagues today. The entrees were Excellent!! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the chips they served with the guacamole were kinda stale. The guacamole itself though was delicious. I will be returning here again."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports. I came here a few times for some UFC fights that were pay per view, and they did not charge any cover, which was awesome!   Happy hour deals here are pretty sweet. Half off appetizers, and beers that cost lower than $5.   I ordered the chicken strips which came with fries. The quality of my food was great! Tasty and lots of flavor for the chicken tenders. The fries were also good. Of course; I like to sprinkle a little more salt on mine. I also ordered shrimp in my pasta (shout-out 21 Savage) and that was a really good dish as well.  Food came out quickly, service was awesome, and the atmosphere is great. A little more on the posh side, but still great!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Stopped in for our first night in town.  The avocado bruschetta as really fresh. We had the pork tacos and  the shrimp tamales. Very tasty.  Drinks were good and the service excellent."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place several times near Panorama towers and was finally able to try it.  Boy what a little gem of a place.  The ambiance is darling, the service is great and the food is superb.  I've been twice now and both times had the prime rib dip.  Best sandwich ever. Moist, flavorful, filling and delicious!    My companions have had the Urth burger (veggie),  lobster mac n cheese, and lobster sandwich.  All looked good!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop here and our entire experience here was truly awesome. The breakfast menu was to the point and the food was amazing. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Hidden away from the strip in a dark kinda industrial area next to the freeway is where you will find The Blind Pig of awesomeness!  Oh wow was this good and just a super chill speakeasy type atmosphere with delicious food and bomb drinks!  One thing I've noticed about Yelp is that you really can find some awesome places when you pull up the local feed in areas that your unfamiliar with this was no exception and a great find!  When we first walked in it looked kinda like a deli that had some grocery type goods with a few chairs and a counter but as soon as we looked to the left we could see that there was a whole other room behind the curtain giving it a kinda hidden feel from the front.  We sat down and started browsing the drink menu even though at this moment I wasn't really feeling a cocktail they sounded delicious and unique as well as free with check-in! You could also order a few other drinks for free with your check-in of those a smoothie sounded delicious and it so was packed with berry goodness all around!  It's kinda dark inside too so it provides a bit of a ambiance that's perfect for a mellow night and why my pictures are dark I didn't feel like it would be right to use a flash here and disturb other patrons.  For dinner I decided to order a Steak Sandwich it was super good the steak was cooked perfectly full of flavor and went well with the garlic aioli sauce that was on the delicious bun!  My lady ordered a pesto type pizza with white sauce it had broccoli, olives, onions and other delicious toppings not knowing how big it was the pizza was definitely enough for two of us which ment we got to bring some back to the hotel and oh was it good later in the night after a few drinks!  This is an awesome establishment with delicious food and a great vibe to keep it mellow I would highly recommend coming here if your looking to get away from the strip for a bit and enjoy yourself!  We could definitely see ourselves coming back here on one of our next Vegas trips as everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"First visit to the Blind Pig. A little hard to find it's tucked back besides Uncle Sals Restaurant. Very good, the food reminded me of another great restaurant in Scottsdale Barrio Queen.  I had the chicken tacos and they were delicious. Next time I'm going to order their house special Shrimp with  corn tamale. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious and reasonably priced.  I loved the seasoning and recommend the Queso Fundido.  The service was a little awkward, but very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am just now writing a review for this place as it has been a staple in our diet for the last two years. We love The Blind Pig as the food is always delicious and really affordable.   It's not your typical Mexican restaurant as everything is really fresh and never greasy. The staff is great as well and always remember us. I highly recommend the short rib tacos with green salsa, ceviche, shrimp tamale and mushroom quesadilla. They have enchiladas on special sometimes and are always amazing. Not to mention they have top shelf margaritas and Paloma's for $7 all the time.   It is a must try."}
{"text":"The grass fed beef (BP BURGER) is outstanding- huge, juicy,  cooked to perfection (med-rare). This is not your average \"fast food\" type of burger. The taste &quality of this burger could command a much higher price tag but is a steal at $12!!!IIt came with perfectly done sweet potatoe fries that you will not want to stop eating. They are thin,crispy & a portion big enough for 2t3 people. If you are a dessert lover & you are a red velvet connoisseur, the red velvet cake is to die for. The frosting is a cross between vanilla frosting &icecream..unlike anything I've ever tasted..It is heavenly!! The cook at Blind Pig used to be a chef at Mandaley Bay's \"Mix\" restaurant. He takes pride in his craft & the food reflects it. They are now starting to switch up dishes frim time to time, which is great so if you frequently dine here, you will have new dining surprises waiting for you. Blain was our server, total sweetheart. My water glass was neVer under half full & I average 5or 6glasses of water per meal. Excellent &attentive. I have no doubt the rest of the menu is as deliscious. Ill definately be back. Relaxed atmosphere with a take out/deli as well."}
{"text":"Some of the best chips and salsa in the Valley! Throw in the full bar and three TVs and it's a great place to spend an evening. Great outdoor seating with fountain, palm tree, and Edison lights. I recommend the shrimp and corn tamales. My husband got the taco trio and was very pleased. Salsa and chips platter comes with verde and rojo. Neither overly spicy. If you haven't checked it out, definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Good find. Small but quaint. Good atmosphere.  Seems like they really care about their food and it shows. Big portions with an authentic taste. Live music on a Sunday afternoon was a plus. Outdoor patio seating also available. Very reasonable prices. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, not anymore.   Ordered a salad yesterday for delivery. When she arrived she gave me the total and I was taken off guard. $22? There was a $3 service fee, ok. Well the prices that are listed online are not the same as what they charge. I was not happy, but paid the girl and she left. I opened the salad and saw there was no dressing provided and no dressing on the salad. Normally I wouldn;t care, but I'm in the process of moving and had no salad dressing and the salad was also $17. I called back and was told they'd send the delivery girl back over with the dressing (I'm next door) as soon as she got back. I wait 25 mins and call back and the delivery girl answers saying there was dressing on it and if I wanted more I should have asked. She brought the dressing and snarkily handed it to me. I get it, it's an inconvenience to bring the dressing, but it's your job. You're not a volunteer, it's your job ... that you are paid to do. As a reasonably intelligent adult, I feel confident in my ability to assess whether or not a salad has dressing on it and don't need to argue with someone about it, it's silly.   This is my last bad experience with this place, we won't be ordering ever again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today, and was not very impressed by the restaurant.   Environment: it may have been bad timing, but it seemed like this place was better during the evening. The set up was nice with some hipster decoration. It seemed like a nice place to grab a drink with a friend after work.  Service: it did take a while for the waitress to come. I don't blame her though. It wasn't very busy, about 10 customers I total, but the waitress pretty much had to take care of everything and seemed overwhelmed. I also asked her about a food option, in which she responded with \"if it's not in the menu, then we don't have it\". I feel like she could have been nicer about it.  Food: I ordered the steak sandwich, which was good but the bread was very hard. I also ordered the fettuccine carbonara which was pretty overall. It was creamy and the shrimps taste good with it.  Overall, I feel like it may have been bad timing. I wanted to grab lunch with my friend who was visiting, and it seems to be better for cocktails than food and better in the evening than during the day."}
{"text":"Go here for anything with pork in it. Everything else will probably be average. We came here for lunch right when it opened and seeing that the interior looked a bit too dark for a lively lunch, decided to sit on the scenic patio overlooking the fountain. We had the pig wings, queso dip, and I had the shrimp tamale as my main entree.  We were first served glasses of water that had strange bits of particulate in it. I'm hoping it was bits of carbon maybe from whatever filtered water was used and not something more insidious. The queso dip was a gigantic size, and served with corn tortilla chips. While I enjoyed the hearty portion I could mainly taste bean and not much chorizo as was advertised in the menu. The pig wings were delicious, covered in a slightly spicy, sticky sweet sauce with tender meat that fell off the bone. I would definitely get the pig wings again.  I wasn't very impressed with the shrimp tamale. It was a beautiful presentation but I didn't like the moat of sauce covering everything. The shrimp were plentiful and had a good grilled flavor but were slightly overcooked. I didn't really like the corn tamale either, which had a texture that was too grainy for me, and too sweet.   Service was OK. The server didn't really seem that enthused to be here but she did provide an adequate amount of service.   I'd probably come here to try some more pork items and to enjoy the patio if it's a nice day, but I'll stay clear of the other items."}
{"text":"The crispy pork is divine,just like the other reviewers said. The steak sandwich was good but undercooked comapared to what my husband requested. Those that like it rare should be fine. I got the kale and greens salad with an added grilled chicken breaast - it was great., The vinagrette was so good I was licking it off my fork! The design and atmosphere was great, we loved the free smoothie for checking in on Yelp, and the friendly service could not be more welcoming."}
{"text":"My little girl and I went for a swim at the condo. She was hungry so we decided to go to The Blind Pig since it was easier to get to. We didn't want to dine in, so I asked for to go. It took them 45 mins and the place wasn't busy at all. People before us sat, ordered, and got their food in 10mins while my daughter and I waited for our food. The manager kept apologizing for the for the wait. It was ridiculous! Making a little kid wait that long?! Nobody seems to care. My daughter asked if we can just go to In N Out since it was taking so long. I was considering it, but the waitresses and manager said it will only be a few more minutes. Didn't know a few more minutes was 45 mins?! It's not a kid friendly place. They purposely make you wait longer if you have kids."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the chicken ciabatta but everything else I've had here was on point. The staff is very friendly and helpful with suggestions. If you're in the area give it a shot, if you're not in the area, get in the area."}
{"text":"The tacos are insane! Best short rib taco I have ever had. Service is friendly. Beans and rice are also great. Beans were smooth and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Feels like a local secret. Seat yourself. I got the classic pizza and it wasn't my personal favorite... But my husband got the lobster & shrimp mac and cheese and we give it two huge thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Nice small spot. Problem was it's too small and the parking lot is small too. Parking was very hard to find. We made reservations, but because it was fight night is was really crowded and they couldn't get a us a table. We sat at the bar instead....The bartenders and food servers were quick and the food and drinks tasted good. Great customer service overall."}
{"text":"Ordered my lunch through Grubhub.  My meatball sub was awesome!  Delivery was within 20 minutes so it was still really hot.  So glad I can get this while sitting at my desk through Grubhub."}
{"text":"this place is re-donk,  nom talm bout? 1st things first walked into this bih feelin like a gah damn check udigg? greeted ya manz wit a warm, \"whats haaaannin? xd\" second of all, errtyme i sit muh fine ass down i get str8 blessed by da baddest gyals on treez fam. all da servers remind me of my beamer, but just a quick shoutout to kellz and alicia for holdin it down for da bois. on another note . . . they keep the bathrumz here dumb cozy. manz feelin str8 sanitized when he pull up to these toilets n' sinkz. overall manz would come again and again, s/o to the joint        p.s. dey tiramisu is a must copp, that shit dummie thicc  #nocap #fullsend #udigg   with love, da wingz boyz"}
{"text":"It exceed our expectations. Great food, great drinks and I LOVE the little shop that's attached"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Prices weren't too bad especially compared to most other places here in Las Vegas. My waiter was rarely seen but I'm not going to count that against them though bc their staff all pitched in to help when needed. The atmosphere was fantastic and the booths were very comfortable! I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty dead. We thought the restaurant was closed since the parking lot was empty. This is a good option if you want something off the strip that is quiet. This on the opposite spectrum of Lavo's champagne brunch. No need to dress up or put makeup on. There were only two other patrons occupying the bar. I ordered the lobster mac and cheese and it was okay. It was definitely cheesy but lacked the lobster bits. Restaurant is under new management so the yelp check in 1 free beverage is no longer being honored. The decor is really nice and dark. The booths are like VIP club booths. This the perfect place place to come while hung over since it's nice and dark."}
{"text":"I really liked it and the server was lovely. I got the torta though and I would try something different next time. Everything in the sandwich had a soft texture and it needed something to sink your teeth into. Husband had the sausage and peppers, it was good. Would like to go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Nothing too special here, but there's usually decent live music on the weekends. Lots of TVs if you want to watch a game or something though I think you could find a much better place to watch a game downtown."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Right off the strip so pricing reasonable.  Great lunch.  Dinner menu looked good too."}
{"text":"TBG is worth a stop for lunch. We had the Mahi Fish Tacos and the Short Rib Tacos today, both were excellent. Each had 3 tacos for $8.00. You can also get 2 tacos and a side of beans or rice for $5.00 and a la carte tacos for $3-4 each. Although I stuck to diet coke which they serve in a 20 oz bottle I did see several customers having a very health pour of wine.  The butcher shop sells quality US Prime beef, but you have to pay for quality. If you are comfortable with US Choice beef sold by the chain stores than the price of US Prime beef will be a shock. T-bone and ribeye Prime beef steaks are $19.99/lb. They also have a selection of chicken, lamb and fish.  TBG is definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Located inside the Panorama Towers on Dean Martin, this is a very upscale trendy bar! There is ample parking in the front of the bar, but also valet service. They had a wall of liquor that was massive! I couldn't even get it all on one photo. The menu is very interesting. It was mostly Italian, but there was some Asian flair mixed in. I tried the \"50 Shades of Bleu\" cocktail which was a fun take on a Moscow Mule. I also tried the cheese garlic bread. It was soft ciabatta bread that was crunchy on the outside with melted cheese. It came with a tasty Italian marinara sauce. They had nice private booths that would be great for a date night dinner. Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place only has 4 stars. I love it. I love the atmosphere and the food! The burgers are amazing!! I like the pork belly nuggets too, may sound a little strange if you haven't had them but they're really good. The lobster Mac and chopped salad are both great too. This place is a little far from my house but so what it's an easy drive so the taste of the food. They added a bunch of tvs since the last time I was here too and play all the sports events which I like too. Especially for my friends that are into sports bar. This is a sports bar ish kind of place bc of tvs but the food takes it to another level!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The location is absolutely gorgeous with amazing interior design.Their menu is really well put together and they have a ton of great recipes. However the size of the caprese salad that they charge $7.50 for was laughable. They serve you 4 tiny balls of fresh mozz (bococini) no bigger than the size of a quarter.. And 4 small slices of heirloom tomato.. The real reason I'm only giving them 3 stars is because of the horrible service. The only time the server was at my table before dropping the check 20 mins after we were finished was to to take our order.. With only having maybe 3 other tables and having the manager clear our plates there was no excuse to leave us waiting so long for our check.. Specially when we were on our lunch break. I was sad the service sucked so bad because everything else was so on point!"}
{"text":"Yelped this location for lunch and glad we did.  Really good food here.  We had the chips and salsa with guacamole.  There is an up charge for this, versus most places which just drop off bottomless chips and salsa, but the guacamole was handmade and so are the salsas.  Good stuff and for $6, not complaining too loud, as guacamole is always extra no matter where you go - chips were refilled at no charge.  I prefer them fresh and hot...these were maybe out of bag, but they were decent.  I did the pick any two taco combo.  I am a real fan of the crispy taco...these were okay, but not the best I've had.  The real find was the Short Rib Tacos - man oh man...I wish I had two of these - they were that good.  They have a few other specialities, but you won't be disappointed if you order one of these.  The choice was rice or beans.  I picked the rice and it was also tasty, with a hint of pineapple and some other goodies mixed in.  We used the rest of the $6 salsa on top of the rice.  Service was promote and efficient.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a favorite neighborhood restaurant for us, and a place we can go to weekly without getting bored of the menu. We've tried almost everything on the menu and for the most part have been impressed. Some standouts are the guacamole salad, ceviche, pig wings, and short rib tacos. The shrimp tamale is sweet and decadent - not a typical tamale but good in its own right. I've seen a couple reviews complaining that the food lacks flavor, but that has never been our experience. The food definitely tends to have a good spicy kick to it, but if that is not your preference there are plenty of mild options to choose from. We've always had great service, and as frequent guests it is a treat that the servers remember us and our favorite food and beverages. The menu is priced so reasonably that it's easy to pass on a happy and just eat here. It's definitely our preference to shop local whenever possible, and the Blind Pig continues to be one of our favorites."}
{"text":"FREE PARKING hassle free.... we were so excited that it was so easy to find parking. The food was amazing. My Hubby had the spaghetti and meatballs which had a robust garlic flavor, My son had the pepperoni calezone, it was super delish. My Turkey sandwich had the perfect blend of flavor piled high on perfectly toasted bread. Waitress wasvery nice. Thanks for an awesome dinner for our last nightin Vegas. We will be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Another one of Vegas hidden gems. Located on the first floor of the Panorama Towers right across the 15 freeway from the strip, and they offer their own private parking spaces. I can see men liking this place the most, due to their big portions, beer, and their brick decorated walls and lounge setting. It is a self seating restaurant, so just pick a table because there is no hostess.  The menu offers your typical bar/American food, including appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, large entrees, coffee, smoothies, and cocktails. The Blind Pig is not only a restaurant, but they offer other prepared meals to go, or you can call in for your food and pick it up.  I ordered a BP Burger which includes Gruyere cheese, thick bacon, arugula, served with french fries. My friend ordered a chicken chopped salad, my favorite part about it is the vinaigrette they use."}
{"text":"Too bad the employees are not running the show anymore.  They actually cared about the patrons."}
{"text":"We had the avocado bruschetta as our starter, short ribs and short rib tacos for our entree. The reason this place didn't get 5 stars was they were out of al Pastor, the main reason I came to try it.   Service was fast and friendly. The dining room is a little dark and quiet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place recently and dubbed it as a douche bag pub since it was filled with over aged jocks and frat boys.  Other than that it was good.  I loved their cocktail list amd the food was great!  We ordered the pork nuggets which came out perfectly crisp and was accompanied by a sauce im assuming is made with sriracha..it was good!  We also shared the shrimp and lobster mac which he loved and I liked. Im not a mac n cheese fan and I still enjoyed it. It was good.  I like this place overall. The service was polite and on top on things."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a disappointment. I was excited to come here for a friend's birthday but it was a complete let down. Our server Nicole was nice & we did have a party of 9 but I only got my water refilled once, after having to ask for it. When I ordered my prime rib I hadn't realized she never asked me how I wanted it cooked, until I got my steak which was cooked well. Far overcooked from the medium rare that I like.   When it comes to the food the calamari was just okay. The prime rib was over cooked & just not very good. Tasted like a cheap cut of meat & not worth the $30. The pasta side was good but when I asked for what the side options were I chose pasta because she offered it & did not tell me it's an extra $3 for it. I don't mind the price but let people know ahead of time. The cheesecake was good & the chocolate cake was a little rich for my taste. Honestly the best thing here was the pretzel bites. If you're looking for pretzel bites then give it a shot."}
{"text":"For a butcher shop/Mexican restaurant, this is as good as it gets! Went here for lunch thanks to Yelp reviews. Had the stuffed poblano chili which was HUGE and creamy and delicious. The bf had a torta which he really liked. Our waitress was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about which items were gluten free and which weren't, what more could anyone ask for? If you like Mexican, stop here!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and craving Mexican food. After a long Yelp search, we happened upon this place. It's a great atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. We started with ice cold beers and the halibut and shrimp ceviche. I highly recommend it, very yummy! I ordered the braised short rib with house rice and my husband got the chicken taquitos. Both meals were delicious. The menu wasn't large and had some unique items. All sounded great! The staff was friendly and attentive. We will go definitely visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The place was clean, nice and quite. The staff did not know the menu or what was in each dish. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Walking and found this place. What a great find! Very nice bar and great staff. Not to mention the rum selection!"}
{"text":"Great ambience with a low key calm feeling. Out door seating near some fountains is very peaceful. Ordered the ceviche and a side salad , both very good. Service was excellent, I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"When this place was a BBQ joint, the food was great and the service was awesome! Now, I have no idea what happen.  I had a group of 15. I made a reservation on Open Table. When we got there, they did not have our reservation. It took a while to get tables set up for all of us. Once seated, our server had a terrible attitude, the food was horrible, and when we told our server that our appetizer of chicken fingers wasn't cooked, she looked at me like it was my fault.  I was so disappointed. We will not be back. Taking that place off of my list of places to recommend."}
{"text":"This is about The Blind Pig only and not Hobe Meats with whom I was much displeased today, but that's another story.  Had lunch at The Blind Pig today and I was very happy with my experience. They have some wonderful taco choices. I tried the pork, short rib, and mahi mahi. The short rib was my favorite, the pork my least favorite. They probably ended up with four instead of five stars because of that pork - way too dry. The mahi mahi was good, though. You can get a really nice taco plate with two tacos and rice or beans for only $6. I got the beans, hubby got the rice. Both were tasty, but the beans were awesome. The taco plate left me pleasantly full and was bigger than I expected for the price.  Service was very good. We paid a total with tip of only $45 for four people for a really nice lunch with beverages. Seriously, though, you could get away with spending even less. And the food is very good."}
{"text":"Just finished two of the BEST TACOS I have had in a long time. You can mix the meats of your choice.  You have to try the beans - WOW !  The portions are good sized and filling.  Red and green salsas are a little spicy  for some people. They offered jalape√±o ranch. Try the Pigs Wings, you won't be disappointed. Thank You Tonille, for great service and recommendations."}
{"text":"Compared to other Mexican/Southwest restaurants we've been to in Scottsdale, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and even Tucumcari, this one rates 2 stars at best. The guacamole was not very flavorful, the rice was cooked nicely but lacked taste, and the \"refried\" beans were not. They were, rather, more akin to a moderately thick bean soup - put them on a plate and they ran over the whole plate. My burrito was OK - the meat was tasty, but it was assembled more like a wrap with all ingredients starkly separate so it was difficult to get all ingredients in a single bite. My wife's al Pastor tacos weren't particularly flavorful and the pineapple was actually sour. Even the chips served with the guacamole were thick, tough, and saltless (if that's a word). I would not go back, and, if you've read any of my other reviews, if incredibly uncommon."}
{"text":"Had high expectations as I came back with my boyfriend. We met here at night for drinks only on our first date. This place is nice. decor is gorgeous. service is nice. The food though is nothing to write home about the turkey club was dry, and the chopped salad was a disappointment with undressed ice berg grilled lunch meat on top(same meat as our sandwich). It was underwhelming to say the least."}
{"text":"Ever since the new owner took over I could not be happier! The staff is attentive but not to the point you wish they would leave you alone. The food is delicious and fresh.  What a great change of review/ opinion of The Blind Pig. I love having a good place to run for a bite to eat or drink!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night and needless to say the best Italian I've had in a very long time. Perfect service and the food was flawless. Had the opportunity to meet the owner who was an extremely nice guy who cares about the quality of his food. I live in SF and I would choose his food over a lot of well-known restaurants in the SF area. Try the chicken marsala and enjoy."}
{"text":"Although I did have a great time at the Pig, its really just average to me, not a 4 star dance / clubbing experience.  The basement is a little shady but it is what you make it.  The band upstairs was good, I did dance, but probably only stayed for an hour or so.  Free cover is always good and the bar itself is spacious, clean, and seems to cater to the working professionals in Cleveland.    I did spend one new years eve at the Blind Pig and Dive Bar.  All 4 of us got drunk and had a lot of fun.  The two bars interconnect through the basement, so I would consider it again on new years if my old ass ever gets approval.    I have never eaten here, or if I did, I don't remember."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here was simply amazing. The wait staff are friendly and the ambiance is great. Pricing is right on."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very comfortable and attractive atmosphere! The ingredients are fresh and the recipes are authentic and original. Plus there is something on the menu for everyone. Options to dine indoors or out on the patio where there are space heaters. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  The food wasn't on par to the other Mexican places I've eaten. Would rather have Chicago's in Houston more authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"Food is great and the buildout was done correct.  They spent a lot of money on this place and it's worth trying it out!  They have breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Love the nachos at the blind pig! I've only had a few things from here but everything I've had has been delicious! Oh also the mushroom quesadilla!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It has a pleasant, swanky atmosphere with good food and an outstanding staff of servers and bartenders.  The management always makes a very sincere effort to make sure you are happy every single time.  If you visit you'll quickly become a regular."}
{"text":"The Pig Wings were pretty amazing as was the rice that came with the taco combo which is why they got 5 stars. The service was very good so don't be mislead by the \"bar-type\" atmosphere you will see when you walk in. We had the shrimp tamales (a little too salty but still good) and the taco combo with the excellent rice. I would recommend you put it on your list of places to check out."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local for an off the strip place to try. Food was excellent, and the price was right. Half price apps before 6pm was great too. Had a artichoke spinach dip, pasta dish and a chopped salad, all excellent."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Decided to try the Short Rib tacos based on the other reviews. Did not disappoint! It was very good. The brownie dessert was amazing too. Excited to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Very cool spot between the Panorama Towers and The Martin behind City Center.  I had a late breakfast/early lunch with a buddy at the Bling Pig on a Friday.  The place was empty, but a few customers came in the market side of the business.  We sat down and were immediately approached by a server.  She was very friendly, and was throughout the meal.  Refills were prompt, as was the check.  Great service throughout.  The restaurant side is very comfortable, but non-descript.  It's like what a TV set of \"location:  pub\" would look like.  That said, I didn't have any problems with it.  It has a nice bar, TVs, and plenty of additional seating.    I went with the meaty wrap, which is scrambled eggs, cheese, sausage, bacon, and ham in a tortilla with a side of breakfast potatoes.  It was a great deal for $8.  The wrap was fresh, it was still steaming when it was brought to the table.  And, it is certainly packed full of meat and cheesy goodness.  The cheddar was in every bite, which was nice.  The eggs were scrambled well and weren't overcooked.  The tortilla could have used some crisping on the exterior.  A minute or so on the flat top with a little butter would have added a ton of flavor and made it look nicer.  The breakfast potatoes were fine, they needed additional seasoning.  But, average.  Overall, it was a strong breakfast, and like I said, a good value for $8 given the amount of food.  I also tried the shrimp and lobster mac n cheese.  There is plenty of seafood in it, you should get some in every bite.  It was topped with breadcrumbs, which is always a good idea, but they weren't toasted enough under the broiler.  They needed a little longer to really crisp up to give some texture.  I liked the sauce, but it was a little lacking in flavor.  The menu states it's a \"mascarpone cream sauce with fontina.\"  I would agree with this, those are good cheeses but not the most flavorful.  I would invite some of that cheddar from the wrap to the party, or at least some parmesan.  I'd order it again, but it needed a good helping of pepper and hot sauce.  Overall, cool joint, I would return."}
{"text":"I almost never say I love restaurant food, but this was truly exceptional. The wild mushroom quesadilla was delicious with a side of jalapeno ranch dipping sauce, and .the guacamole starter was plain and pure, as it should be. My dad had the burrito combo with beans and my husband tha al pastor quesadilla. All were delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos; the shrimp, chicken and fish tacos were faves, the rib one was a little dry. Flavorful salsa but it could be a bit hotter. Flavorful rice and beans, good chips and a nice little patio. Perfect for lunch tacos!"}
{"text":"Traditional?  Not so much. Tasty?  You bet! Fresh?  Abso-fricking-lutely.  Don't go looking for free chips and salsa to go with your Mexifood here--that's a separate item on the menu, and you'll be paying for it.  It's worth it.  At The Blind Pig, they have only the very freshest ingredients, and the food has the flavors to show it!  My tacos salida were remarkable, and the mac & cheese needs to be tasted to be believed.  I could go on, but I'm going to cop out and suggest that you go here to really find out how good this place is for yourself.  There are a lot of great Mexican joints out there, but this one is pretty unique in its own way.  Somewhere between the spice balance and the freshness, this place really stands out.  Really--you'll want some for lunch the next day.  Prices ain't bad either."}
{"text":"The best food ever! Cubano sandwhich is amazing the Shrimp tamales were fantastic as well..."}
{"text":"I believe this place is by the same owner of the two restaurants next door. It has a nice patio and a relaxed atmosphere.   The food ranged from good to excellent. The cocktails were not, but the bartender was so obnoxiously cute I would've probably choked down whatever she could wring out of the bar towel. I'm lucky my gf doesn't mind if I'm a creepy ogler once in awhile - she thought she was hot as well.   The drinks we tried had either too much alcohol or were too sweet. They were really accommodating and sweet to us, so we felt bad saying we didn't like them.   Anyway, regardless - the mac and cheese stood out, and we liked the salsas and guacamole. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice setting, excellent service, delicious food!  Had the special stuffed poblano pepper (? I believe?).  It was exceptional!! Will definitely be visiting again!!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect this place to be so good. Get the Chicken Taquitos and thank me when you do.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu.  Cocktail list could use some love though."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  The food wasn't great.  I was mostly surprised at the lack of water on tap.  3$ for a small Fiji bottle.  We ended up getting forced to buy a coke product cause that was on tap and had refills.  They forgot to bring out the au jus sauce with my sandwich.  And didn't bring us utensils and napkins until we asked."}
{"text":"Oh yea this place is the truth. I got the pork belly nuggets. The sauce that comes with it takes it to the next level. I also got 3 tacos, beef chicken lobster. All had great favor. Would def come back and try these and other options."}
{"text":"I've never met a restaurant with Pig in the name that I didn't like and I'm so glad I finally tried this place. It's a little hidden gem. The food was delicious. I had the torta (the red sauce is the best I've had) and my date had the burrito combo. Their take on rice was yummy! The Paloma fresca was fresh to death! The ambience makes the place that much better. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A nice eclectic mix of Mexican and American food.  Hard to find in the strip mall due to its tucked away location.  They also have a nice patio area. Service was outstanding, guacamole was good.  Burger was good but some more attention to the side dishes would help."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful!  Ambiance and decor is terrific and perfectly done.  The bar has a sense of new age with old world elegance that is not too stuffy.  Its nice to see this is Las Vegas.    My only issue is the cost.  The price point is a touch too high for their food.  I understand that it is necessary to have higher fees because of their location and hours but Its about $1 too high on almost all products.  I had a turkey sandwich that was amazing but priced at over $12... its not worth it.  I don't mind spending on good food and everything seemed fresh.  Plus, I would love to make it a regular place that I frequent but I don't know if this price is worth it.  However, I will definitely be back (maybe not as often as I was hoping) and I would still highly recommend it.  Note:  I didn't try the pizza... hopefully that will change my mind.  My other small issue (and this may be because it just opened or because I completely missed it) is that the products on the shelves didn't have the price.  Awesome that they even sell some of these items, but it seems odd that its not tagged or easy to find.  I'm sure this will be fixed soon.  Servers and staff were great!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   Very cute and trendy spot. Menu is simple which made it even harder to make a choice. EVERYTHING sounded delicious! I ended up getting the French dip style roast beef sandwich. It was very good, I loved fried onions on it they made a welcome addition to the sandwich. It could have used a tad bit more of horseradish on it but overall it was good. My friend had ordered the burger and I was able to snag a bite... It was to die for. So good. The bacon added just the right amount of smoke to the burger without over powering the burger itself. We also ordered a couple of the signature drinks which were good as well.   The only drawback I can say was the price it's a little on the pricey side for a burger or sandwich which side choices are coleslaw or potato salad. But regardless of the price I will definitely be back! I'm already craving a burger.   It's easy to get to and the parking is convenient."}
{"text":"A late arrival in Vegas led us to this spot. Had been here before with a large group and wanted to try this time with a smaller party. Drinks are great, well priced for premium liquors and the signature drink list was really interesting. I would come back just to try some of those but I had already ordered a Jameson Ginger and an 805. Chicken Parm sandwich was solid and a big portion. Pizza was a nice, thin crust, a little salty overall but good while enjoying drinks. My daughter had the fettuccine Alfredo which was fine, her second time ordering. Our server, Rebecca, was attentive and sweet, and offered explanation when food took a little longer than expected with a small crowd. Appreciated that. Would visit again, more for drinks and atmosphere. Very hip and engaging hang out!"}
{"text":"First time eating here last night. Food was just \"ok\" and our service was soooo terrible. We waited over an hour to get our food. They were also out of sour cream. How can you be out of sour cream at a Mexican restaurant?! We were also asked if we saved room for dessert--we hadn't even gotten our dinner yet. Big bummer because we were looking forward to eating here after reading other reviews."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent in excellent taste, flavor and presentation. This is a hidden gem of a place! Tacos come on flour or corn and you can even get grilled shrimp tacos which aren't on the menu but just ask they will make it for you! This review is long overdue. I eat here at least 3 times a month when I'm not traveling.   Some of my favorite items are:  Great Guacamole  House Rice Short Rib Tacos (one of their signature items) Grilled Shrimp Tacos They also have a Shrimp dish entree that is delicious  Green Salsa is excellent  Short Rib nachos (the absolute best nachos in town!!!) I often get these to go so no one can watch me pig out on them.they are so freaking good!!  I also enjoy the professional staff. They have had the same people working there for years. They treat everyone like a regular and are super sweet and kind. I often get to go orders as mentioned above and they have never messed my order up. They are one of the few constantly consistent restaurants in town.  This is absolutely casual Mexican dining at its best. They also have live entertainment on Sunday afternoons in the summer and the band has grown to perform some nice epic country songs that are indicative of the southwest. Last time I was there one dude even had a fiddle. It was so freaking cool.   This is a super laid back place with excellent street Tacos and more. Service is always great. If you're looking for an authentic Arizona dining experience this is the place. No fluff no frill just great food in a neighborhood restaurant with full bar!"}
{"text":"Love how fresh all the ingredients are. The tacos are my favorite as well as the guac! I always get great service here which is something that cannot be said for a lot of places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Nice dinner. Very friendly and nice atmosphere.  Staff is a bit confused and unorganized but still very much worth eating here!!"}
{"text":"The Blind Pig has to have one of the best services I have ever encountered for a restaurant. Our waiter was very nice, prompt, and informative with any questions we had about the menu. He repeated the specials of the day like a champ and told us which ones were the favorites among the menu items. The Blind Pig also sports a great free check in item in which you can get a free juice, smoothie, or coffee, not sure about cocktails, but the free smoothie is definitely worth it.   I went with a banana strawberry yogurt smoothie, the smoothie tasted creamy, fresh and delicious, it was a nice balance between the tart and sweetness of all 3 things. I shared the crinkle fries with cheese curds & gravy and some crispy pork belly nuggets. The fries with cheese curds & gravy were good, although they were not crinkle fries as was indicated on the menu, the waiter did inform us that they had changed it to regular fries months ago, but never changed it on the menu. The crispy pork belly nuggets were seasoned in some dark sauce that tasted sweet, the pork belly wasn't super crispy, there were bits that were and some that weren't.   For my entree, I wanted to eat something with a fork, so I skipped the sandwiches and ordered the lobster & shrimp mac n cheese. There was a decent amount of lobster and shrimp in here, cheese wasn't overwhelming. They use macaroni shells if you were wondering."}
{"text":"Thought that I was just ordering from the nearest place possible and let me tell you. I ordered from the best place ever. For the price the food is totally worth it!!!!! I got Pretzel bites, pot stickers, and chicken tenders thinking they would not be enough for me but I was wrong this feeds two people!!!! And it is all Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect. Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Do not be deterred by the fact that it is located in a strip meal. The shrimp and tamale was fabulous. The green enchiladas we're delicious. Chorizo flat bread huge and tasty. Mac and cheese not so much... Overall great meal and it didn't break the bank"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great place to get dinner and relax. I found it when staying at the nearby Hilton. The food is great and reasonably priced. I sat in main dining area they also have lounge like areas with couches."}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible! You would think a spot like this would be amazing, let alone it was pretty hidden/dark spot of Las Vegas. The outside looked like the place was closed. We continued to go inside and it was empty on a late Friday night. Ambiance was cute though. This is a WARNING! You get a free cocktail/drink when you check in on Yelp. They had their holiday special cocktail drink and lets just say luckily it was free because it tasted terrible! it was either too sweet or tasted like medicine. Obviously the bartender did not know how to mix drinks at all. They messed up my friends \"red headed slut\" drink the bartender had added Redbull and my friend had to coach the waiter to tell the bartender to never ever have Redbull in a red headed slut. The only thing i enjoy was the Seared Salmon.. to me it was great. To my group of friends they ordered the Bootlegger Strip Steak (dry even ordered it on Medium),  'Speakeasy' Steak Sandwich (dry),  Shrimp and Lobster Roll (nothing special), Blind Pig Chopped (plain) and Stozzapretti Pasta (was okay)."}
{"text":"Reasons to Avoid: -GLASS IN FOOD -POOR SERVICE -NEARLY NO ONE IN THE RESTAURANT ON A TUESDAY WAITED 49 MINUTES  -COLD FOOD    I came here with a group of five. We showed up for lunch at noon. There were four other customers total besides us at the restaurant.   We didn't get our food till 12:49pm. The waiter didn't say sorry or even try to offer an excuse for the delay.   One of the people I was with found a piece of glass the size of his thumb in his food. The majority of the food was cold or skip the simple request given of \"no onions\".   I strongly suggest skipping this place. Between the waiter not really caring about the customer experience and the glass. It's not worth the gamble."}
{"text":"The food was delish but it took the kitchen an hour to get it to us...My guess is they lost our order which does happen from time to time. Due to that fact though I have to give three stars. The patio area is very pleasant especially for Arizona winters."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Perfect prices! The food is to die for. Huge proportions! The best place we ate at during the whole trip."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food!! Can't ask for anything more. Try the short rib tacos... They are a must!!!"}
{"text":"Sophisticated and chill ambiance.  The booths and loungy feel remind me of vintage Vegas.  The lobster mac and cheese and deconstructed tuna appetizer is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  It is great to have a new restaurant/market so convenient to Panorama Towers!!  The decor is very warm with brick walls.  It seems like just a deli/market when you first walk in, but they also have a full menu and a lounge on the other side.  I think you always order at the counter for food, but I am not sure.  I saw where someone else mentioned that you can order at the tables in the lounge.  So it was a little confusing because I left a tip at the counter and then had great service at my table and wasn't sure if I was supposed to tip again.  They didn't have prices on the market items yet.  The food was excellent.  I had the chopped salad which had great ingredients, but could have been chopped more for a chopped salad.  My son had the burger which was fantastic!  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I really liked the atmosphere in the lounge area and could really see it becoming a great hangout for locals.  They also have a parking lot in the front.  The is a great spot and I hope they do well!!!!"}
{"text":"great food.  great service.  great prices.  go there weekly and always have a great time as well as food.  I almost always get weekly specials and love them.  get the pig wings....theyre amazeballs!"}
{"text":"My BP burger was decent, but it's not worth the trip to the restaurant for it. The best part of my meal was the BP lemontini and the 3 scoops of ice cream. I didn't think the food was worth the cost!"}
{"text":"Found this place on an app while looking up bars that show UFC ppv, called & found out there don't have a cover charge & that happy hour was doing on during the prelims before the actual ppv starts.  They have great happy hour prices, appetizers were half off, beers prices were as low as $3-$6. The chicken strips were probably some of the best I've had, & the seared tuna was pretty good too.   They located right off the strip behind the Caesars palace area of the strip, and catching an Uber/lyft here is a breeze."}
{"text":"Tenille(sp?) was the most awesome server! The avocado bruschetta is great & their short rib taco's are good too. With such great prices... We went to this place when it was quieting down (around 9) and it was great for a larger group (9)."}
{"text":"1st time here and everyone ordered something different. Pics attached. $8 meatballs appetizer (the best in town), Pork Nuggets (Pork belly), chicken Ciabatta sandwhich,  Hot dog, burger Ahi Tuna Salad. All for $78.37. Pricey. But worth to try. I would only come back for the meatballs and the burger. The food was good and you can buy a slice of cake or pie to take home!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & food. There's a little bakery/deli up front for take-out, or if you're eating in the restaurant you can have your waiter bring any of that to your table. I have 2 words: BILLIONAIRE BARS!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  We were a goup of 5. We ordered apps and entrees, too full for dessert.   Everything was great!!!  Pizza, pasta, sandwiches.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes good food."}
{"text":"We ordered a few different things from here and had it delivered via Postmates. The two standout and most memorable dishes were the short rib tacos and the shrimp tamale. By far the most phenomenally tasting items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas, fabulous food!!! I have tried the ceviche, the short rib entree, the carne asada tacos, the queso fundido app, avacado bruschetta, and the pambazo (over several visits). Every single one has been tasty and there are still more things I want to try!  The staff have been friendly and accomadating. Only wish is that they would do separate checks!"}
{"text":"Really nice and cute place. It's barely noticeable, especially being situated in the same block as the Panorama Towers, so it's easy to drive right past it at first. However, it's a nice and quiet place to eat at if you want to avoid big restaurant crowds.   Their menu consists of appetizers, some entries, and mainly sandwiches. The food is reasonably priced, too - most of the items are below $20. I had the onion rings and the shrimp & lobster mac n' cheese. The onion rings were really good - fresh out of the kitchen! The mac n' cheese looked more like typical pasta, but it's still pretty good nonetheless.  Overall, I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio. Ambiance nice enough, considering it is a strip mall and you are sitting next to the parking lot (AZ is all strip malls). Some of the food was amazing, some mediocre.  The shrimp tamale was amazing. Soft and flavorful and moist. The side of beans and our guacamole was so good.  We also got the carne asana tacos and they were dry, with only very dry meat and cabbage in them. They tasted good, but I expected more. The chocolate mousse cake we had after dinner was not very good, I wouldn't do dessert here again.   Overall I enjoyed eating here, I think your experience probably depends on what you order."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!   I finally  convinced my boyfriend to go here, and now he goes to lunches and dinners with work people instead of with me.  I don't have a single complaint or criticism.  The food is great, up-scale pub food and the service is friendly and great.   Bookmark this place if you don't decide to go immediately!!!"}
{"text":"So the food was pretty good! I had the fish tacos and enjoyed them. My friend liked her meal, too. Which is a bummer because...  The service, was weird! Our waitress was super pushy and asked me if I was ready to order a drink like 4 times in a matter of 10/15 minutes. I told her sorry, that I've been talking (catching up with a friend) and haven't had a chance to look yet and she pointed out that I basically might want to stop talking and look because they were closing in an hour. Rude!  At the end when our check came I asked her if we could get separate checks and she said they can't do that, but that we could split it. So I wrote down the dollar amount (to the penny) that each of us were going to pay. Both amounts ended in something like .16 cents and .18 cents. I explained who was paying what and she tells us that she can't do cents either and instead has to round it to the nearest five or something...?!? WTF? So she said it would be rounded up to .20 cents instead. So you can't charge me .18, but you can charge me .20??? I've never in my life heard of such a thing!!! I don't even care about the extra cents, its the principal of the matter. And as a business if you're having technical difficulties (or whatever) you shouldn't charge the customer the extra cents, no matter how little, it's not my problem! The proper thing to do would be to take a hit and round it down (if anything) and get your crap together! Ugh, the whole thing was frustrating. Plus, she was so rude about it!  Listen up: If they charged 200 people a day for a month an extra .05 cents because of this \"issue\" or \"incapability\" they would take home an extra $300 a month!! Something seems super fishy here. Just sayin.  Anyways, I'd say give them a go because the food was good, but if service is shotty or weird things happen don't say I didn't warn you :/"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. I would come back for sure and highly recommend.  Pros: - Short wait time. - Servers are extremely nice and ask if you need anything multiple times. - The tacos and short rib are delicious. This used to be part of a butcher shop.  Cons: - None."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until the new manager took almost everything I love off the menu and they don't deliver anymore. I'm suffering from an injury and they always delivered until recently you shouldn't change things like that especially since your residents pay your bills."}
{"text":"I had to try this place based on the name (I am a Teacher of Visually Impaired). The short rib tacos were amazing! Way more than I should've eaten at lunch but I couldn't stop"}
{"text":"This is my third and probably the last time I'll come here. Appetite got so ruined by this time's tall waitress. I think her co-worker called her \"Vanessa\"? Yelp says \"Ambience: romantic\"?yeah, ONLY when a server does a DECENT or higher job and this chick ruined every ounce of it. There's something wrong with her one way or another. I usually let ill-mannerism and mistakes slide up to three times, because I understand that everyone forgets to do an attitude check or get overwhelmed by their day. It started from the moment we walked in. She was all the way at the far end of the restaurant just staring at us for a while AND THEN nodding her head sideways (to imply we should walk over there and save her any efforts). She didn't even ask if we wanted the perfectly available booth or any other table; out of the confusion from her silence and unmoved figure, we just sat down at the table closest to her since she was too lazy to walk towards us and with us. She did not act anywhere near similar to how the other servers (from my previous visits) had acted; heck, it's not even the way any DECENT waiter or waitress would act at any restaurant regardless of the type of dining place. She was not at all informative; partially because she chose to not be informed, herself. She made no efforts into explaining anything. My friend and I kept trying to ask her questions and she would ALWAYS disappear immediately without a care to let us FINISH saying what we were trying to say. Every time she was obligated to talk to us (probably to fool her co-workers into thinking she's even a decent waitress since she's so two-faced and LOUDLY asking how we were doing as if her volume was on purpose), she always acknowledged my friend and treated me like I was invisible. I had to keep trying to get her to look at me since I knew more about this place than my friend did and I knew how to word things more clearly and briefly than my friend did. Lady, I was trying to make your visits to our table easier FOR YOU. My friend didn't know what the heck he was trying to say to you and you constantly gave him your ear with an eager smile and bullshited response. Every time I tried to help him get to the point, you'd just give me a your constipated expression. If your selective hearing can't hear me, than just tell me to speak louder. If you don't know what we are trying to ask you, then ask us for more details and actually LOOK at what we were trying to show you on our tablet/smartphone (yelp app check-in offer) instead of constantly walking away prematurely. To add, she always talked to us from far away: from the counter, from the other tables, or while walking around..instead of taking just a LITTLE bit of more time to walk to our table and stand there like she should be. Whatever her reasons for being so rude and improper were, she had no right to keep it up for the WHOLE time I was there. It may be my imagination, but my observations find that she was biased towards people who obviously have money. For example: a nicely, but casually-dressed elderly white couple and, my 100% asian friend who looks 100% white and was dressed all spiffy in his button-up, vest, and fedora. Then, there's me, a 20-something Asian wearing no brand names and looks like a middle-schooler. I may be a student/Asian, but either way I'm not stereotypically stingy on tips in case you thought there was no point in treating me as an equal to my friend. By the way, I called this place a few hours prior and asked if they're usually busy Saturday evenings. They said no. So, it's not a solid excuse to say \"Vanessa\" was busy. There were plenty of other employees here. These two of five stars belong to: the chef and the awesome guy (shorter than vanessa) with the apron that always comes out of the kitchen. On my first visit, he was the amazing server for my table. He and the majority of servers from anywhere UNDERSTAND how SIMPLE it is to kindly tell a table that he will be back in a few minutes if he were ever too busy to spare us even a measly SINGLE minute ON-THE-SPOT. Guy-in-the-apron, I admire you for being professional on-the-job regardless of what bad things may be going on in your life or refraining from any favoritism towards patrons. That tip WE left was meant for the guy-in-the-apron. We kept it really small in case the sucky waitress wasn't required to split it amongst the group and got to keep it; she deserved zero tip after the 6+ moments of shitty service she gave. Speaking of which, she didn't give us time to finish asking for the check. We wanted it split. No matter how much I love the Poutine and the Crispy Pork Nuggets here, it's not worth coming back if the appetite is just going to get ruined to the point where WE can't taste anything. FYI, it was freaking delicious when we ate the leftovers HOURS LATER."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place I've found since moving near the strip! Foods amazing and always delicious! Even when I get it delivered!"}
{"text":"Yummy food cool atmosphere. It's nice and dark, perfect place to escape the Vegas light and heat. Menu is pretty delicious and not over priced. If you check in, you get a free drink!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple times. You can get a cheaper happy hour elsewhere but the mac'n cheese and the crispy pork nuggets will change your life. The Poutine is the original...most places put an American flare to it but this kept it real. The steaks are moist and flavorful. The mix of flavors are put together well. Drinks are strong and atmosphere is awesome.  We like the location as well....you get the strip feel without the hassle of the strip. Definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig is an amazing little gem. The food is incredible and the people that work there are wonderful. Their specialties are the shrimp and corn tamale and the pig wings. Every day they have a special and it's always delicious. Last night we went and had two specials - roasted pork tostadas and chicken mole enchiladas. I can't say enough about this place, just try it. It's very casual and fun. We have been going once a week since we found it a few years ago. By far my favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a south Scottsdale gem of a restaurant. I've been to the Blind Pig several times in the last 3 years.  My boyfriend and I started going regularly for lunch, dinner and take out orders.  I've waited to write this review because I've had mixed experiences while dining at the restaurant. Not all servers are created equal, some are just not as efficient as others.  My recent trip back was excellent!!  Raoul was our server on the patio who was great.  I ordered the Nachos and the shrimp corn tamale.  Both dishes are packed with flavor and deliciously seasoned meats.  My biggest decision is which entree to order because they all are great.  I want one of everything!!!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place so we decided to try it out.  Amy, our server, was great and awesome with the kids.  They are bringing back the lobster Mac and Cheese, it was their special that day, it was delicious!  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things, so my expectations were high. I popped by for lunch yesterday and tried the special - Steak Tostadas, I also tried their guacamole both of which were very well done. I really like the layout its modern, simple and clean with a fully functioning butcher shop to boot. They have a patio area with a fountain which will be nice post summer. Waitress/bartender was really sweet too."}
{"text":"Poor blind pig, ended up in a butcher case! Now I didn't get the chance to order up some of that pig, but I did have a great order of Carne Asada Tacos! Now there isn't much to a carne asada taco, but mess up one or two of these ingredients and I'm out. Number 1 and my most important ingredient is the meat. The Blind Pig seasoned the meat perfectly and grilled to perfection. Meat wasn't dry and trimmed of all fat. Number 2 is the tortilla, has to be homemade or from a local tortillaria. The tortilla was from one of those. Soft corn tortillas that didn't break and had some flavor to them. The rest of the ingredients just need to be fresh. Make sure you get the chips and salsa. Once again made there or somewhere in town. Looking forward to going back to The Blind Pig and trying some of the other refrigerated animals in the butcher case!!"}
{"text":"Although this was our first experience and cannot be measured to others, we had a great time @ the blind pig!! We definitely appreciate good food that is close to the fun of the strip without being right on the strip. This restaurant is like the hidden gem we have been looking for in terms of good food and a cool, nice yet casual atmosphere. The ambiance was awesome with the dim lights, nice music, and funny pig artwork, and the booths were both stylish and comfortable in the bar setting. It's not so much a restaurant as it is a lounge area that serves food... When we walked in we didn't see any host stand... and there was a bar top with tvs that were playing basketball on one side of the room so we assumed we just sat ourselves. But we were able to choose our own seats immediately after entering at dinner hour on a Saturday night and had great service. Everyone was very helpful and nice to make suggestions. We ordered the pork bites for an appetizer and both got the steak sandwich for dinner. The app was amazing! It was a rather small portion but for two people sharing it before dinner it was good to taste. :) it was a little spicy and very flavorful and it was half off during happy hour which lasted the length that we were there (from 5 to almost 6:15).  The entree was also great! It was very flavorful and not skimpy on the steak at all. And the fries were also up to par. :) we also ordered wine that was on the happy hour price list.. A good glass for $4. We liked that a lot too because we usually don't see happy hour wine specials when we go out. The lounge/dining area was clean and comfortable and all of our food met (if not exceeded) our expectations. We will be back for sure and we will bring friends next time!"}
{"text":"We came in to order some lunch and they told us they just opened today and that we are the first patrons. I guess we get to be the guinea pigs for The Blind Pig.  Because we're two tiny women, we both shared a margherita pizza. My co-worker also got a side of onion rings. I think they might need to re-think the margherita recipe. There wasn't any fresh mozzarella or tomatoes on this margherita pizza. It was a regular cheese pizza with basil leaves; and although it was good, it wasn't a margherita pizza! The onion rings were really great also.   This place is a bar, a lounge and a deli. You can also order salads and deli items for to go for a fast lunch.  Since the first visit, we've ordered several items from their menu. Most notably we love the chicken Ceasar salad and the lobster Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We came to try out this spot and immediately the experience was just bad. One bartender wouldn't let us get a word in edgewise. He was pretty obnoxious.   The other bartender was super nice but totally ignored our empty cups sitting for over ten minutes.  My fianc√©e was waiting a long time to even be acknowledged. This is really disappointing because the decor is awesome and the vibe is nice. We cancelled our food order after being ignored (mind you, there was only two other ppl at the bar)....we were visibly annoyed and when we told them to just cancel the food, they basically shrugged and gave us the check. It was just sad. I hope they get better."}
{"text":"food is good. placed to go order. was told 20 mins waited 55 mins for a 20 minute order and then was told they were busy. I told them to maybe tell their guests an actual correct time....smh"}
{"text":"Great food and great server!!! Jessica was so friendly and attentive. It was our first time there and she made some great suggestions on what to order. We ended up ordering a caesar salad and the chicken fettucini. It was all very good."}
{"text":"Excellent outdoor place with really flavorful food. Drinks were perfect compliment to the cool outdoor setting. The indoor space was ok, great little bar, tv would have been annoying to me if I was sitting inside. Servers were very helpful and put up with our fun-loving group."}
{"text":"Great service, good tasting food at a reasonable price. A new favorite of mine that is located close.  Food is good, price is reasonable.  The tacos are good, the salsas taste authentic.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here last Sunday, ending our Vegas weekend and was greeted by smiles by Alicia. She was our server for the day and full of spunk. We all ordered a round of drinks, bloody Mary's, micheladas and beers. All were great and refreshing. We also ordered their clams in sauce and calamari. Both were AHHHMAZING! The clams and the sauce and bread, delicious and fresh. The calamari was nice and crispy and the battered was perfect. I got the BnJ (I think that's the name) burger and added a fried egg. It definitely hit the spot and was huge!! I saved the other half for road. Our friends went with linguine and shrimp, Alfredo and shrimp and burgers. The pricing isn't that bad either, we all had two rounds each and we were a party of 6 and the bill came out to $280 with gratuity. The Blind Pig was definitely a good place to get our last meal in Fabulous VEGAS! Alicia is also a great server and has great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Meh... My boyfriend took me here for a random date night because he used to eat here when they still had Poutine and Lobster Mac on the menu (which apparently were very popular).   The decor of the restaurant has a big jazz feel to it. It'd be a great place to take a date; very dim lit, velvet booths with accent pillows, so it's very intimate for dinner time.   Pretty much every entree on the menu ranged from $15-$20, aside from their fish of the day options which were $25. By their prices I expected that their food was going to pretty good, or at least nothing to complain about, but boy was I wrong... I ordered the Lobster Raviolli ($18.99) and my boyfriend ordered the catch of the day-Salmon $24.99. There were exactly 5 pieces of raviolli on my plate, which were all swimming in sauce. The lobster taste was pretty much undectable, and for $18.99 for some damn raviolli, I'd like to taste some lobster. My boyfriend's salmon had a side, which I can't remember what it was so apparently it wasn't anything speciail lol, the salmon seemed to be only seasoned with salt and pepper and was extremely bland. My boyfriend's a big fan of salmon and he didn't even bother to finish his meal, it was that unimpressive.  The funny thing is, a LOT of people say the same thing about The Blind Pig; it's not the same since they've been under new management, the quality of the food isn't great, and the popular menu items are no longer there.   The reason why I gave this place 2 stars rather than 1 is because the service was great. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, even though she was obviously the only one working the floor.   If I were to come back, I'd come back just for the bar area. Their bartenders seemed entertaining and their signature cocktails looked good."}
{"text":"I like the lounge-feel interior of this place. Bricks, plush seats, curtains and interesting ceiling. They have a pantry where they have beer, wine and other libations as well as items you'd find in some pantries (fig almond cake, Nutella, pasta, real mustard, red pepper tapenade, etc.). They have Veuve and Moet! They have a deli section which has orzo pasta, couscous, salads, sandwiches, cheesecake, monkey bread, brownies, cookies (chocolate protein cookies even!), Nutella pound cake, and other desserts. Then, there's the bar and dining area. On the menu they have: appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pasta, steak frites, shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, salmon, ahi tuna, roasted chicken, smoothies and coffee.  Chocolate Hazelnut Verrine: This has got to be my Blind Pig favorite. Layers of delicious light chocolate mousse and sweet, nutty and crunchy brittle. 5/5  Orzo Pasta: It has a tiny bit of a tang and minty-ness - just enough to make it taste interesting. The texture is just right. It has olives, red onions and tiny bits of feta. 4/5  Nutella Pound Cake: I love pound cake and to add Nutella to to the batter is pure enjoyable madness! It's filling and delicious. Buttery cake with sweet chocolate hazelnut swirls. 5/5  Shrimp and Lobster Roll: I got this with a side of French fries. They use Oreida frozen fries - booooo! This had no flavor. The roll was toasted but it has no butter - maybe, they're health conscious? I really don't know but if I wanted something healthy, I'll eat a salad. 2/5  Porchetta: POR-KE-TA...not porch-eta...not porsche-eta. C'mon! I enjoy a good porchetta sandwich. That fat and oil with herbs, spices and salsa. My favorite version though has crispy skin and this one did not and tasted a bit much of fennel seeds. They are generous with pork portions though. 3.5/5  Skip the fries and the kombucha drink! Try the blackberry hibiscus drink though."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Patio seating is really nice when the weather permits. Always a spot we go back to."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from the Blind Pig while on a conference trip in Vegas. I wanted to stay in so I found it on Yelp. The menu was fairly large with lots of options. I ordered mozzarella wedges, chopped salad and chicken parmesan. I also ordered what I thought was chocolate mousse. Delivery was well within the time frame provided and the delivery guy was polite and quick. All the food was packaged well (with Italian, this is always a factor to me). Only problem, no utensils and no salad dressing. Bummer. The mozzarella was still hot and marinara clearly homemade. I tried the salad with no dressing and it had so many toppings, it wasn't bad. I bet the dressing would really have made it. The chicken parmesan was good and the linguine was served on the side - also good. It wasn't as warm as I would have hoped, but I had to go search for utensils. I'm saving the cake since it surprised me. I thought it was mousse but it was chocolate layer cake. Will try tomorrow."}
{"text":"I was looking for place to have a bite that wasnt the overprivced casino places or fast food.  I found this on yelp . It was very pleasant. The service is good and the atmosphere is relaxed and quiet. I had the daily special dtrak sandwich which was good, the salad was meh,, but edible.  I would give this place 3.5 but we cant split ratings.  Its not gancy (which is whaat i like) but its tasty and pleasant"}
{"text":"We used yelp to find a new place to go and we were so satisfied with our meal and the service. We started out with Chips, Guacamole, Red and Green Salsa. We ate two bowls of the chips, guacamole had large pieces (just the way my husband likes it), and the salsa was tasty.  The Shrimp Burrito was delicious, Mac n Cheese was so very good. Will definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Guacamole and salsa Verde were unbelievable. Short rib taco - perfect. Carne asada taco didn't dissapoint. They ran out of pastor so I can only imagine what I missed. This is a must if you're in the area. Btw the staff was super friendly and made it a great visit."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 paws.  I know the humans think the food is great, but they told me the service is kind of ruff. Plus they have to leave me at home when they eat there.    For a place with an animal in their name, () you'd think they would allow me on the patio at least.   Non-Toby Friendly"}
{"text":"OK those were the best shrimp tamales I've ever had in my life.  Perhaps the only shrimp tamales I've ever had -- but they were OFF THE CHAIN.   We had the pig wings and taco toes (spell check refuses the real spelling) they were very good but my Mexican husband claimed the filling was too spiced -- not hot spicy but too much of the flavor   $32 for everything.  Whut?!?"}
{"text":"Steak and eggs was average. Urth burger was good, but I've had it elsewhere. Brownie Sunday was excellent."}
{"text":"Fun, flavorful and friendly.  Small Mexican restaurant next door to Uncle Sal's.  You will enjoy yourself here.  Food is very fresh and plentiful.  The drinks are very well made and they do not cut corners here.    Check out the patio as well.  Very relaxing and you never feel rushed here."}
{"text":"You ever go to one of those places that the food in the pics always looks great so you go there and order it and it's really bland and nothing special?  This is one of those places.  The part that bugs me most is we decided to try something new when we were heading to the BOMB New Mexican places in town which is right across the street. We talked ourselves into something new. Oops   The prices are reasonable. That's the only reason it's not getting a 1 star"}
{"text":"This place is unique and hidden away. I saw the blind pig while driving south on the 15 and noticed it was on dean Martin dr. We decided to give this place a shot and it was fantastic. They offer fresh juices and quality dishes that are fresh. We ordered the poutine fries, the chicken Caesar salad, and a club sandwich. Everything was good except the salad was very light on the dressing and a bit on the small side. I would recommend the fresh juices as they are fresh and healthy. They have desserts and I have to recommend the chocolate croissant."}
{"text":"Thanks for the great food we had today for lunch brought in by o e of our medical reps. We had chicken Marsala,stuffed manicotti and salad. Will definitely e visiting with my Husband because we both love to eat great food."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say I was really, really worried about the parking situation and even came up with a Plan B in case parking didn't work out here.  Well, when we came in on a Sunday for lunch, there were plenty of open spots designated for The Blind Pig, and there was even an overflow area on the other side of the lot which still had some spaces available as well.    Also, another thing I must mention, make sure to check in on Yelp and show your free drink offer to your server!  You can select from their juices, smoothies, and signature cocktails if I recall correctly.    The restaurant was about half full when we arrived and we were given our choice of seating.  We selected a nice comfy booth.  I was worried that it would be tight after reading one of the reviews but it did not feel squished at all.  We were greeted promptly by our server and our food and drinks came out right away also.  We split their shrimp and lobster roll and shrimp and lobster mac and cheese.  Both dishes were good - we finished just about everything!  We maybe had some fries left over, which were maybe the best part of the meal - nice and crisp!    Service was just okay, but overall, a nice solid meal at The Blind Pig.  They posted a picture on Instagram of a po boy sandwich they were serving after we had dined there.  Would've tried that if it were available!  But still a great lunch, and the free drink was a nice plus to our meal :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after the magic trade show. I have been here once previously but I just got takeout. (Lobster mac and cheese. HIGHLY recommend it.) This time I actually got a table with my brother.  We walked in and were seated right away. It was crowded but not packed. Service from beginning to end was very courteous and attentive. Our iced teas were refilled several times and the food came out fairly quickly.   Now the reason I came here was to try the poutine. I've always heard of it but being as its a Canadian dish I had to try it. It did not disappoint. Fries with gravy and cheese curds just sounds so indulgent and rich. It was really good. The only problem I had with the dish was that it was pretty salty. The added gravy only made it saltier, and I like salty food. I couldn't finish it but I did enjoy it. I had the bacon and eggs too, which was good but you can't really mess up bacon and eggs, but if you do I will find you. And I will kill you. My brother had the prime rib dip and that was super good. I wished I had gotten that.  Everything is great about this place, the decor, the service, the food. The only thing stopping me from five stars is its a little over salted, and that's coming from a guy that usually adds salt."}
{"text":"Every torta was amazing. Enchiladas were amazing. This place is spectacular for a local hub. Get the nachos with any protein for an appetizer. Kyle was our server. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Another sample of bad customer service.  What happen to this places they are beautiful but the people working here probe & scan you, it feel like you need to pay first to have some one ask you and take care of you."}
{"text":"Greatest chicken nachos, mahi mahi fish tacos ever! My husband loved the burger too, it was big enough for 2 meals! The service and atmosphere is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Blind Pig since we moved here 3 yrs ago. We were going to a show at Tropicana so I looked up restaurants near by and The Blind Pig popped up!  We were able to make reservations which was great and when we arrived we were seated in a comfy booth on the bar side. The decor was great. A lot of TV'S I am assuming it is a big game day hot spot. Which we aren't huge sports fans so it was a little disappointing that the sound for the basketball game was on and not just playing and silent with music playing instead. Had we sat more on the restaurant side or even outside on the patio it would have been the same since there were TV'S everywhere you looked.  That is the only reason I gave a 4 and not a 5. As far as everything else...service, food, drinks...perfect! We ordered the hot artichoke and spinach dip with chips to start and 2 rum and pineapples. The dip was hot and packed full of more artichoke hearts than spinach which is rare...normally other way around. So off to a good start :) my man ordered the Italian beef sandwich with fries and a side salad. I ordered the fish of the day which was halibut with a lemon caper sauce and veggies on the side...broccoli and potatoes...or I could have had saut√©ed spinach...and I also ordered a side salad...I wish I hadnt...the side salads were so big we could have shared one. So most of mine went to waste.  My man said that his sandwich was good but he hoped for more seasoning...but the meat was really tender. They serve the best meat here Boar's head...anything you order sandwich wise is going to be delicious. I truly feel that is the best meats around.  My halibut was cooked to perfection...it was a really nice piece of fish. The sauce was yummy, nice and citrusy. There was mushrooms in the sauce which I don't care for but they were big enough I could easily pick them off.  I am glad I got the broccoli and potatoes...the potatoes were perfectly grilled, crispy on the outside and soft on the outside and they were seasoned well.  Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we were good to go and very friendly!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great for a low key night out.  Pig wings were phenomenal. Also had al pastor burritos. Just the right amount of spicy goodness! Great local place on our last night of vacation. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just go here! Jose the bartender...awesome. Food...awesome. Market...awesome. Bathrooms...awesome. And they serve Breakfast wraps all day at their lounge!"}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of the Blind Pig. It's on Dean Martin Rd., and a little off by itself in that loft area, but once inside, it reminds me a little bit of a New York cafe.  One side is this little bakery area, and the other is the bar/lounge/restaurant. The seats are big and comfortable, and the Bloody Marys are tasty. I tried the lobster & shrimp sandwich, and it was really good. A lot of places that offer lobster anything usually skimp on the lobster meat, but this place doesn't. The sandwich was meaty and done very well.  Staff was great. Our waitress was friendly, funny, and attentive, making sure every drink was filled and we were happy.  Like I said, the atmosphere was great. It's a little off the beaten path, and it wasn't crowded (which was a good thing), but I would absolutely go back.  A really enjoyable dining experience, and a great \"hidden find\"."}
{"text":"I work walking distance to this place and finally stopped in. Have to say I understand what my co workers were saying. Great food at a great price. Iam going to come for more lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a group of friends.  EXCELLENT!!!!!  We ate outside because the weather was nice and the atmosphere was so relaxing with the water feature going.  Everyone in the group was very pleased with the food.  The prices are very reasonable, service was great and the portions are substantial.  You can't go wrong with lunch here."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant off the strip. The bar is one of the best in Las Vegas off the strip. If you want to dine with the locals this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow especially for a Sunday night.  I would give 3 stars. Short ribs had a good kick to them but not as tender as I wished they had been. The crab stack was great. Tacos were average"}
{"text":"We had been waiting to try this and we were not disappointed.   Interesting location and food was great.   Recommend the Crispy Pork Belly, French Dip and Lobster Mac and Cheese.    Service was a little off but I think she was new.  She couldn't help much with menu suggestions as she was a vegetarian and also doesn't eat bread?  The market is a plus for heading home after work.    I'd try it again and hope the service was worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the place was pretty deserted for a Tuesday night.   Service was prompt, and the Mexican food was OK, but not over the top good like I had the next night.   So, it is located in the corner of a strip mall next to a very popular (by the traffic) Italian place.    I don't remember what I had, so that tells you a little about how I felt about the menu. Probably will not go back again."}
{"text":"A fellow teacher recommended I try this place and he really hit the nail on the head, it's mouthwatering delicious. I highly suggest their pig wings on their starters menu, that chipotle glaze is to die for. I'm a HUGE fan of tacos so it only made sense for me to try a few of them and they exceeded my expectations. If you want a nice little date night that won't break the bank, then dine here!"}
{"text":"Went because the menu they have online looked great, lots of sandwich options. Got there at 10:15 and we're told only breakfast was being served. There's no breakfast menu even on their site. At the top of that menu it said lunch starts at 10:30. Ok, only 15 mins away, so we ask to see lunch menus and our waitress says lunch begins at 11:00. So we broke down and got breakfast, it was ok, tough to screw up eggs and bacon. The real kicker was at 10:35 when some other customers came in and were seated next to us with lunch menus! We asked a different waitress when lunch began and she said 10:30.... we told her what we were told by our waitress and no apology or anything. We really wanted lunch and if it wasn't for the incompetent waitress we had, we would've come back later, but not anymore. Might want to train your staff a little better."}
{"text":"Food is solid if you know what to order and the restaurant has a nice casual vibe. The carne asada nachos are killer, and the house rice with chorizo and pineapple is super tasty. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla, which was too rich for me, but I tried a short rib taco off my friend's plate and it was yummy."}
{"text":"I was hoping to rave about this place but unfortunately that is not the case. This place was probably one of my top 5 worse customer service experience ever! Let me try and paint the picture for you... It was the spot we selected for a surprise birthday. Venue was very cute and quaint, with brick walls making me feel like there was a lot of history behind the building. Something you would see in New York. It was a Saturday and not busy at all. The restaurant had a different type of set-up, almost in a shape of an L. Our party of 10 sat in the smaller section. We had one server & later found out it was her first day. In the beginning majority of the party was going up to the bar to get our drink orders. The bartender informed us that if we are with the big party, our server will come to us. Fine, no big deal. It took the server about 15 minutes to make her way to us where she would only start with 3 drink orders at a time. Drinks slowly (key word) trickled out. Before making sure the whole table was good with drinks and even water for the entire party she started taking food orders. It wasn't to our knowledge that food orders weren't all taken nor placed until only ours came out. We are here for dinner, we all eat together! The server was very sweet but definitely needs more experience prior to working a big party let alone be on the floor by herself. She immediately informed the staff. Next thing we know the bartender is coming to take our order. He says 'everyone needs to sit down so I can get food orders taken and in at the same time'. I chuckled about this. He made it seem like it was our fault the server couldn't do her job. Again, some orders were placed now for the second time. Throughout this whole waiting period, our sever was not attentive at all. Multiple times I asked to make sure the whole table had waters, never came to check up on beverages. It's one thing that she is new but the restaurant had about 3 other tables to service. Where was the rest of the staff? Food finally came out and to be quite honest, I'm 99.9% sure that the food we sent back the first time was now in front of us for the second time. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza and lobster Mac n' cheese. Both dishes were cold! The sauce of the lobster mac n cheese was thick and all saucy at the bottom; as it was just sitting out. Neither of them looked freshly made. And the comical part of it all not once did a manager come out and apologize. I was baffled at this establishment and their lack of customer service recovering. With all the constant back and forth and searching for our server and informing her of what we need, no one said or did anything.  Bills were spilt and came back with the first couple and charged them $11k. Aside from that amount actually authorizing the servers response was 'oh yea, I thought it looked funny'!! As bills were being settled lights were turned off. I understand we were there past 10PM, but that was not our fault. Have a little courtesy, Blind Pig and appreciate your customers a bit more!  Service is the only part of this experience that sticks in my mind in which I nor the rest of the party will never return!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Gourmet food on beer budget ? And in Scottsdale? I must be dreaming.. This is one of those places you almost want to keep secret for fear that it will become too busy. Love the outdoor patio too. Recommend Shrimp Tamale, Short ribs, and Guac. Good pours on wine, too!"}
{"text":"You would think something with the word \"pig' would be good, but.... I would never order this bruschetta ever again. It's so bland, it's the opposite of the ocean! Ask for salt!  garlic! balsamic vinegar! olive oil! Also the oil hasn't been changed.   These all things that this complaint can fix, maybe in a year things will be different. Positive"}
{"text":"Not the usual run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant.  Shrimp on tamale on rice awesome, wild mushroom quesadilla super!  Fair prices. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is extremely good. The iced coffee is delicious. Big flat screen televisions to watch games with sofas. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when visiting Scottsdale, AZ.  It is a fairly small place and the bar appeared to be filled with the regulars when we stopped in late on a Tuesday afternoon.  That made it a bit noisy, but the crowd wasn't really a problem; they were obviously just having fun (they appeared to be retirees; probably snowbirds from back home in Minnesota!).   I had the Pambazo \"House Special\" Sandwich, which was carnitas pork, with red sauce and creamy slaw on a roll.  Nothing super special, but it was good."}
{"text":"We have ordered from the Blind Pig many times, but the new menu selections are unappealing. My partner's favorite item on the former menu was the \"Blind Pig\" salad, but since it is no longer available, he ordered an Antipasto salad for pick-up. He said the new salad was loaded with high quality and delicious ingredients (the mozzarella and the meat), but it lacked an adequate amount of lettuce. I noticed this seems to be partly due to the fact that they are now using much smaller takeout containers (in plastic rather than the biodegradable choice they used to use). The process of picking up food was also confusing- it was unclear where to pick up the food, and there was no host at the podium. We hope our feedback is noted so that we can bring our business here in the future."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We had a great time for superbowl and will be back next year forsure!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my dad for lunch out on the patio. The things that were good were insanely delicious, but the rest were fairly mediocre. We split the guac, the pig wings, and two tacos - short rib and carne asada with the house rice. This was plenty of food. The guac was one of the mediocre items. It had a weird artificial lime flavor... like a cleanser almost. Also, they used pepper in it, which is just plain weird. It was not wonderful. The pig wings were one of the insanely delicious items. They were sooo good! Like the most tender barbeque pork rib with a wonderful glaze.... it, in itself, is worth a return visit. The carne asada taco was one of the mediocre items. It was dry, kind of bland, and nothing I would order again. The short rib tacos were incredible! The short rib was moist, tender, full of flavor. I would get this item again. The house rice was also very good, it is rice with chorizo and pineapple in it.... that is fabulous! I would love to come back here for these few memorable items and to try some new items as well.    PS the prices are very reasonable, we were stuffed for under 20$"}
{"text":"Shrimp & Corn Tamale, Shrimp & Corn Tamale, Shrimp & Corn Tamale. I've been here 3 times and ordered the same dish each time. It's that good. The Paloma Fresca is the perfect accompaniment. Tasted my dining partners' Ceviche, not doing that again, and their Adobo Braised Short Rib, ho hum, it's the tamale that I'll return for."}
{"text":"Call the butcher shop this morning to see if they any thick 2 inch steaks.  They didn't but after checking with the boss, the guy said he could cut me one.   When I husband went to pick up they cut to 2 1/4 inches just to make sure.   It was absolute perfection.  Perfectly marbled and was so tender it was like cutting butter. Thanks so much guys at Blind Pig!"}
{"text":"Fun bar and grill downtown Cleveland. It draws a pretty big crowd and has been around for a while. You can usually count on having a fun time here and not spending too much money in the process."}
{"text":"Everything was stupendous. The outdoor patio seating is cozy and comfortable - it's nice to see there is a place in Scottsdale that doesn't offer a \"dog friendly\" patio. I don't always want to be subjected to someones well dressed, stroller pushed, dander shedding, drooley \"fur baby\" while I'm enjoying a nice meal.  Service  from Erica was perfect - she is one of the best servers I've ever had. Friendly, helpful, perfect timing without lurking. She even took our late night coffee order with a smile on her face even though she had to get it from the restaurant next door. THEN there is the food. Oh my. Everything was delicious - first time in a while I didn't leave someplace with a box. The house rice, shrimp and corn tamale and chicken taquitos deserve special mention, but everything ordered was fantastic. The pineapple sorbet is actually served in a hollowed out pineapple. Tee hee!  It probably says something when you're looking forward to your next visit within 24 hours of your first. Check this little spot out for sure. No happy hour and pretty pricey wine options."}
{"text":"It was 1130 and I was looking for something to eat online before everything closes. I looked here and they had a delivery they had pretty good rating so I decided to order. I ordered the lobster filled and it was really amazing like it was really good first of all delivery only came in 30 minutes and the food is very fresh"}
{"text":"Blind Pig is convenient, has tasty, substantial food, and has a fun atmosphere. This is one of my go-to places for a quick meal with a variety of choices. My favorites include the Chopped Salad and some of their pizza dishes are great. They have lattes and other morning beverages which is nice and the service is always pretty good. I hear they have a good Taco Tuesday as well. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"First off the food was completely cold, secondly we were never asked how our food was. On top of being crammed into a tiny corner table and having horrible service the cold food was not tasty and overpriced. If that weren't bad enough, we were all sick the next morning. Avoid like the plague or well let me just leave this emoji here"}
{"text":"Talk about a best kept secret! This place is \"tucked away\" in the office max plaza on the corner of Hayden and Osborn. Sundays from 3 to 6 PM they have live music!! Indoor and outdoor seating is available. Both the waitstaff and bartenders are incredibly friendly. The owner even stopped by the table to check in on us. Are usually have the Al Pastor tacos, but tonight I tried the pig wings. Just enough kick in the sauce to give your taste buds a treat. The pig wings are slow cooked the day before then glazed and placed on the grill prior to serving. Listed as an appetizer these two wings are healthy portion for a small dinner. Served with Rob vegetables such as carrots, cucumbers, radishes, and red onion. The jalape√±o dipping sauce is the icing on the cake! I started with chips salsa and guacamole and had to stop myself before I filled up and didn't have room for my main course. The music wasn't too loud the crowd wasn't rowdy and the prices were reasonable. If you haven't tried this place you're missing out! If you haven't tried recently I highly recommend you come in again."}
{"text":"Location - check  Wait staff - check  Ambiance - check  Value - check  Food - The food was mediocre. Everything was salty and was reminiscent of the mass produced Sysco food products."}
{"text":"Great food! A must stop just off the strip. We will be back!  The Onion Rings are the best we've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I used to kind of like the Blind Pig. It was the cool place in the Warehouse District with the party atmosphere, but it wasn't quite as packed as the Velvet Dog or the Barley House. But after going there a few times, seeing the same lame band covering Top 40 songs, waiting forever for drinks at the main bar, I just got tired of it. The last time I went was when I really decided I didn't care if I ever went back. Because the main bar is usually backed way u with service, I went to one downstairs which was much less busy. I went to the bar, got myself something cheap, a Bud light or miller or something, handed the dude a 20, which I just *just* withdrew from the ATM minutes ago and was all I had, while he handed me back $2 and walked away. I tactfully called him back over and just told him that I gave him a 20. Upon hearing this, he began screaming at me and not for one second considering he might have been wrong. I mean, it was a Friday night, there are people around so the dude was kind of busy, but not THAT busy. After yelling a few minutes about what a loser I am, he took out his cash tray and showed me the 5 dollar bill I supposedly gave him. Right next to all the 1s, 10s, and 20s. I didn't really see what his point was. To the Blind Pigs credit though, when I asked for management, they took me to another room, told him what happened, and they gave me $15 back. overall, not a horrible place to go on W. 6 on the weekend, but you might wish you were elsewhere after about an hour."}
{"text":"If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I LOVE Poutine. Generally when I am looking for some where to eat and my boyfriend is at the same time, my searches start with Poutine while his start with wings. The Blind Pig has BOTH.  The Blind Pig is so freaking cute!! I noticed it driving up the 15 headed for work once. It's kind of hidden on Dean Martin on the ground floor of the Panorama. I have since moved and this place isn't any where close to home, but I still make the trip. Worth it!  They have a fun little menu and awesome beer choices. The prices are pretty solid too. Nothing is worse than finding a place you like but it's too expensive for regular visits.  Parking can get crappy if it's crowded. The lot is pretty small. Also, remember it closes at midnight! So if you are looking for late night eats, you will have to stick with good ol' Peppermill.  Another interesting thing about the Blind Pig is the market and deli they have attached. I actually haven't stopped in because I usually head here late (and I don't believe the market is open), but it looks really neat!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and very helpful. We had the BP burger and lobster roll with fried. The crinkle fries are crispy and tasteful. The bread on the lobster roll was also good, but the BP burger was the best dish by far. They have happy hour at 4 and a reverse happy hour for late nighters."}
{"text":"I love the quality of food and price. Great breakfast place! Their power wrap is really healthy and tasty;  freshly squeezed juices... Yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was an extremely popular venue for dancing and live music. Unfortunately, it is closed as of Sunday, January 5, 2014."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Service was great, and the food was even better! Loved the salsa and guac. Chips were perfectly crispy. The shrimp corn tamale was absolutely delicious: large blackened shrimp, sweet corn tamale with just the right texture, and a creamy, slightly spicy, full-flavored sauce. So good! Had the chocolate cake for dessert, and it was totally worth it. Just rich enough to be good without being overpowering. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Considering how empty the Blind Pig was during the Brunch hour, it left me feeling skeptical about the food. Located right next to the 15 Freeway are some new developing stores in Las Vegas.   Ambiance (4.5 Stars): I love the decor and ambiance in the Blind Pig. It is a mixture of old style furniture with gold and black color scheme that gives off an elegance that you don't often get at many brunch places. There is a bar area, individual tables, and sofa seating areas that are very comfortable. The World Cup soccer match was on near the bar are and we were able to watch the games from our table.  Food (4 Stars): I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Asparagus and Crab/Shrimp; the dish was beautiful and tasty too! The hollandaise sauce was super buttery and complemented the seafood. There was also a side of potatoes that gave you a nice break from the richness of the eggs. The english muffin was crispy and not too soggy either. I would order this dish again.  We had meatballs as an appetizer and it was basically some large croutons with meatballs in tomato sauce. It was okay and the meatballs were pretty dry, but the sauce was yummy and wasn't overly sweet.  Service (4 Stars): The service here was interesting. There is always a waiter coming by the refill your water cup, that I could appreciate. Our waiter gave us the wrong menus to order from and we had to switch up some of our orders. It was an honest mistake and I could see that they were trying their best fix the situation. It was just kind of awkward.   Bottom line: Compared to other places off the strip for brunch, this place is high up there. Good service and decent food."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try this place. I'd never seen nor heard of it so it was a new adventure in the foodie quest.   Located at the entrance to Panorama Towers, just down the block from Las Vegas Golf and Tennis and In and Out near Trop and Dean Martin. Not the easiest place to find, and seemingly out of place considering what we walked into. One side is a deli/mini grocery store. The other a really nice bar and about 14 tables for dinner. This place is non-smoking for those of you who indulge. They have a few tables outside giving you a beautiful view of City Center from the west side of I-15.  Impressive menu, high class furnishings, and friendly service. They've been there about a year and according to the bartender, busy nights vary constantly. When we walked in at 5:30 on a Monday, it was 3/4 full but no one sitting at the bar, so we sat.  A nice selection of beers, arranged on the menu by category. I had a Pissing Boy Belgian White Ale. My friend a Hoegaarten. We started with an appetizer of Crispy Pork Nuggets, which is pork belly in a sweet chili glaze, with a sriracha aioli, and peanuts. Delightfully crisp and light and loaded with flavor. 10/10.  I went with the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, which the bartender told me was rich. I found it delightful, not overly sauced or cheesed, and delicious. Not nearly as rich as the mac and cheese at MadeLV. My friend went with the Prime roast beef sandwich and he said it was one of the best he'd ever had, the roll being soft and good. Overall these dishes get 9.5/10.  Prices are moderate. Upon check-in with Yelp you get a free drink, either coffee, soda, or signature cocktail. I went with the Blind Pig cocktail, which while tasty, was a bit sweet for me.   Come and enjoy this nice quiet little place with great food. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas hidden gem !! 2 sec from Cosmo and Aria!! Come here if your visiting. It's right over the bridge. I had a burger at the bar! Food was fast and cooked to perfection. Staff was very nice and accommodating. Bartenders are great here! I've been here a few times I'm never disappointed !"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, they were cleaning/organizng the bar at the time, but seems to be a good sports spot. Big menu, they use fresh boars head meat. I had the antipasta salad. The large is very big! The greens were actually GREEN."}
{"text":"I cant believe I haven't reviewed this place! I've been here numerous times and service is always stellar and tonight was no exception. I usually have Raul but occasionally I'll get Liz or Tenielle and tonight we had a new girl, Andria, and she was absolutely up to the standard. She recommended the wild mushroom quesadilla with a jalepeno ranch, which should be substituted for every sauce in your life and my friend loved it! I had the Santa Fe chicken salad and other than the cilantro IN the mixed greens, I really enjoyed it! I'm not opposed to cilantro but if I had any complaint, this would be it. I know it's mexican food but its just in everything! We had the homemade guacamole to start and both homemade salsas were great as well. There are so many things I want to try on the menu so stay tuned!!"}
{"text":"Only had take-out but the food is quite good. Some traditional Mexican menu options with a twist. Large portions, great taco's, you can choose between flour or corn tortilla. I had flour and I tried a variety and the best was the short rib, the carne asada and the chicken were good though too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, delivers to the local condos & a great spot to meet friends for food or drinks off strip. Fresh squeezed juices and most of the things we have had on the menu we're absolutely wonderful. Check out their small store for all your quick needs like medicine, ice cream, milk and their salad bar.   Bbq chicken pizza & Caesar salad are some of our favs!"}
{"text":"The Blind Pig is close to my work that isn't too pricey like the strip or fast food crap that surrounds the area. I'm in love with the speakeasy steak sandwich! I've also had the BP Burger which was great but a burger is a burger to me. I have yet to order anything else but when I see other people's food come out it all looks great. But like I said I'm hooked on the steak sandwich. Every time I've ordered it I get medium rare and it's cooked perfectly never underdone or over. The steak is seasoned well, my fries are crispy. I enjoy their Bloody Mary too, nothing fancy there it's just made well and not with that mixed bottle tomato juice either.  Now I must explain the 4 stars last time I went my waitress seemed preoccupied or something. She wasn't listening very well we had to repeat our order a few times to her. She didn't check on us very much so you had to grab her when you could. She would walk away and take forever to come back. Not good for people like me eating on my lunch break and only have so much time."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave reviews but my experience wasn't good.  I was in town visiting friends for 2 days.  On my last day we decided to try the blind pig based on reviews and recommendations.  I don't know what it was specifically but I know I did get food poisoning from here.  My friend ate with me and we shared the salsa and guacamole and she didn't get sick.  So I'm guessing it was my main meal.  Needless to say traveling on a plane the following morning was difficult."}
{"text":"C+/B-  Service:  Our server said that they had run out of a few things, AFTER we had ordered them. (Staff should be aware of what's still available before taking down orders). Additionally, she put in our starter and entrees at the same time so everything came out at once. I really don't like when that happens. Anyhow, maybe it was someone else's fault but it still was an unpleasant start to the evening.  Food:  What I had was Delicious. Something as simple as Avocado Bruschetta was elevated by the simple addition of Lime Juice, Tapatillo, and Red Onion. Think of this as Guacamole without it being all liquidy and mashed up. Wonderful giant chunks of avocado and tomato. The portion was fantastic; I would go back just for this.  Additionally, I had the Shrimp Tamale. While the shrimp was VERY overcooked the portion size was perfect and it had an amazingly creamy, flavorful, rich sauce I wanted to lick off the plate.  My dining companion had the Mushroom Quesadilla. We agreed that while, again, the flavors were incredible...the execution was a tad off. When you bite into it water from the mushrooms drips onto the plate. It happens, they're mushrooms. But you need to cook them down first. Then you can place them into the tortilla and grill. This preparation would help them out greatly.   Overall: Food: B- Server: C - She WAS super friendly though, and apologetic Ambiance: B+ The Restaurant, while on the smaller size, has a nifty little bar in the middle, and an outside patio which can be taken advantage of during great weather.  I'd give my experience a solid B-  Once they work out some of the kinks with food prep, running out of items and making sure that the servers are aware of it, they'll do very well."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada tacos are awesome ! I plan to be back to check out more menu items. I love the fact the Hobe meats counter is located inside the restaurant . I will need to pick up some to go items the next time I have time to cook ."}
{"text":"LoVe this hidden gem!  So worth the trip off the strip.  Great food and awesome bartenders.     Absolutely the spot to have food and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Ok so a year ago I went Pescatarian but knew if I was ever gonna slip up and eat red meat it would be because the food was worth so here I am visiting a spot that I couldn't leave vegas without having my usual steak sandwich. Stepped in the joint and noticed things had changed around, I commented to the cashier and said well I hope the food is the same she didnt say anything and I should have taken that as warning. Food was sooo average and not worth it. The steak is more like a philly and bread was hard previously it was delightful fluffy ciabatta roll. When¬† I went back in to ask did I order the wrong thing?! She stated no things changed and then she should have offered to give me money back. So now I feel a certain way about the customer service. They were polite but if they would have said it changed prior I probably would have checked reviews and then said cancel my order.  I edited my previous review from 2 years ago and gave it 4 stars thought for a minute and wondered how were the rating still so high and thats when i went back and noticed I wasn't the only one so now Ive came back and it gets a 1. Like how do you change something sooo good. Yelp should require new ownerships to start fresh. I was going to contact them through their website but there is no contact form sooo ¬Ø\_(?)_/¬Ø food is nasty we want the old owners back or at least the old food."}
{"text":"The food is always to die here. I had the corn tamale with cilantro cream sauce and shrimp. Tacos pastore was very good and the fish tacos were so enjoyed at our table. We also had a avacado mango and crab stack. Service was also great and Liz did a great job with us."}
{"text":"An urban hot spot. The menu has hot & cold sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, burgers & salads. Favorite is the lobster macaroni & cheese... also a perfect place to grab a beer & watch a sports game"}
{"text":"So this was not the best first experience... My fianc√© and I were sat right away at a half booth inside. Within a couple of minutes we were greeted and received our waters and a Paloma Fresca a few after.  I'm in the industry so I tend to be observant when out to dinner. They are quite unorganized and inefficient  (they are still using paper tickets rather than a POS system for one).  When we received our drinks we ordered chips, salsa and guacamole, which came almost 15 minutes later (they ran out of ramekins for the salsa ).  Before we received our appetizer we ordered our entr√©es.  Needless to say we waited almost 1.5 hours for them to never arrive. I was really looking forward to the shrimp tamales and ceviche based on rave reviews. Tables around us were waiting ten plus minutes to get greeted, standing up and getting their own menus. And another couple that came in a half an hour after us received their food. Not to mention the table next to us who left waiting when they came after us as well.  As I said, I'm in the industry. My previous employer was a popular Mexican restaurant so I know Cinco de Mayo can be hectic.  My patience ran too thin and we asked for our check before our food came when apparently,  \"our food was out next\" 15 minutes ago.  I'm giving an extra star because they comped our drinks and app. If I do ever come back it will be a Monday afternoon."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for comedy night on Thursdays, which is also $2 drink night. I have no complaints about a bar that I can get drunk and laugh for less than $20."}
{"text":"What else do they have to do to accommodate their customers? Nothing. Far exceeding my expectations with excellent service from Jose. EVERYTHING was fresh and delicious. I can see myself frequenting this spot!"}
{"text":"The Blind Pig gets 4 stars instead of 3 just because of all my memories here!!  I don't really go down to the dance club anymore but I still come in for the live bands upstairs.  They have a good selection of bands that come through and as long as you come in on a night with a crowd it is still a fun place to hang out - although their heyday was probably 5 or so years ago.    Also - you can rent out the downstairs for private parties until the dance club opens on Friday and Saturdays.  It's a fun spot for a good sized group and their party food is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"The Blind Pig is certainly an interesting establishment.  A butcher shop, restaurant and a bar all rolled into one business.  I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the concept.  But no matter... no matter that my big scientific brain can't get itself wrapped around the idea.  The food that I tasted and the drinks that I had were yummy.  I stopped in here one evening to have a quick dinner.  The restaurant is small and it was almost full, so I sat at the bar.  Discovered that this restaurant/butcher shop is a member of the Uncle Sal's/Side Door family of businesses.  I also like it when I go to a restaurant and the regulars are chatty.  (this place is new and it already had some folks who say they'd been there every week since it opened)  I'm sitting alone, so it was great.  Just about everyone in the restaurant engaged in the conversation.    The ladies waiting at the bar were extremely helpful with my selection.  I wanted to taste something prepared with the bacon infused marinade that they sell at the butcher counter.  Unfortunately, nothing on the menu is prepared with that.  However, the bartender was nice enough to suggest the closest item on the menu to that kind of taste.  That item would be the pig wings.  Yummy, what an amazing dish.  I think pig wings are starting to take flight!  The wings were flavorful, juicy and succulent.  They had a nice BBQ flavor to them, yet were not too saucy for my liking.  I also ordered their version the Mosow mule.  That was a 3 star drink.    I did not take home anything from th butcher shop.  The meat from the butcher shop is from the acclaimed Hobe Meats of Phoenix, also owned by the same owners.  Perhaps when I want a standing rib roast, I will check here the next time.    There is a large area out front for seating as well.  this is a solid place to go to after work or a baseball game during the nice spring evenings."}
