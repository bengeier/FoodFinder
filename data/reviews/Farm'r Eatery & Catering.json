{"text":"So glad I had a chance to try out this new place on my long weekend trip up from Brooklyn. Really healthy, hearty, and delicious food. The concept was really great, walk up and pick a protein, side, and base that sounds good to you, and 5 mins later a big plate of awesomeness shows up. I went for the lentil protein, smashed potatoes, and slaw, and was glad I did!! Will definitely be stopping by any time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved it! Filling, delicious, healthy, reasonably priced--this place is like having Sunday dinner any day of the week. Slow-cooked mains, tasty sides and salads, lots of veg options--you get to choose your size and combination. Great place for an appetizing, balanced meal if you are on your own, would be ideal for a family or group. Light and airy, lamp-lit outdoor space--nice fresh addition to the St. Lawrence Market/Esplanade stretch. Beer/cider/wine too."}
{"text":"Very tasty, healthy, home style food at a very reasonable price. I like the concept of choosing a protein (My favourite is the turkey meatballs) a base such as salad or potatoes, and then a choice of two sides. I had a local beer and was told they'd soon have a selection of Beau's bottles. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A nice neighbourhood joint in the Esplanade/St. Lawrence Mkt area. Renovated industrial space with warm colour tones, farm house tables, relaxed atmosphere, and good homemade food. It is a lovely place to get together for brunch with some friends on a weekend in a casual, unrushed setting. And the food was delicious. Can't wait to try the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Farmr and visit regularly for my fix of healthy lunch options. I love the roast chicken sandwich and their salad green side comes with a deliciously flavourful dressing with a bit of a kick for good measure. 

Sure, the prices aren't cheap (between $10-15 for a main, $7.50-11 for a sandwich with no side) but neither is fast food these days so I'm fine with spending a few dollars more for food that is sourced locally, prepared in-house using seasonal ingredients and just happens to be delicious at the same time.

There's a huge outdoor patio for summer days with plenty of seating. Their menu changes regularly so check their website. They also cater and you can order through Ritual if you're in a rush.

Farmr also happens to have beer on tap along with cider and wine, and are open til 9pm weekdays so you can totally drop by for a delicious dinner on the patio with a cold beverage. 

A welcome addition to the area that I'm sure will do well!"}
{"text":"The food is good but they are pretty stingy when it comes to the meat. I was given two small pieces of chicken. $20 for mostly veggies? Meh..... It also arrived looking like a hot mess."}
{"text":"Order at the cash and sit down to enjoy casual communal dining. It really works here and goes nicely with the casual but comforting and flavourful food.

We came here for weekend brunch and had:

Tomato & Basil Baked Eggs: $9.99
Tomato, peppers, cumin, feta, olives, baked eggs. Add grilled sourdough bread for +1

Full Farm'r: $13.99
2 baked eggs, peameal OR strip bacon, grilled sourdough, beans, side salad OR potato salad

Everything was tasty. I love their sourdough bread which is char toasted for extra flavour. Reallt the Tomato $ Basil Baked Eggs NEEDS to come with the sourdough bread by default otherwise its literally bowl of tomatoes (though tasty), topped with eggs. The potato salad is also amazing!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night looking for a healthier option compared to our usual restaurant meals. For around $15 each you can get a main meat option and two sides. 

We got the chicken adobo, miso eggplant, roasted sweet potato and the turkey meatballs, eggplant, and potato salad. The chicken adobo was really, really good! It's a new item on their menu. We also loved all the sides we got (particularly the eggplant). The turkey meatballs weren't my favourite - they're spiced in a certain way that I didn't quite like and when the dish came out the meatballs themselves were no longer warm.

They have a really nice summer patio in the shade of a large arching alley way and they had cute lights set up which made it a great place to eat. And on Monday nights they offer a bottle of wine for $20!

I've heard that the portions when eating out are a bit smaller so it's better to eat in if you can. My friend also comes here regularly and suggests the beef brisket sandwich. I'll definitely come back to try it!"}
{"text":"I have been searching ages for something in Toronto similar to my favorite healthy homestyle chains in Southern California - Tender Greens and Lemonade. Something that is casual cafeteria style that is perfect for a weekday lunch or dinner that is healthy but doesn't require the time, expense and commitment of full-service dining. Farm'r is as close as I've found here in town!

The proliferation of bowl places in Toronto is ok but what I really want is a delicious protein with sides just like you'd make if you were a great cook at home. I had their hay chicken with kale/mushroom, salad, and root veggie slaw and had it with a ginger butternut squash soup that tasted like a warm hug on a chilly day! The yummy toasted bread on the side just oozed quality. To be honest the main didn't blow me away like the SoCal chains but I loved the fact that it was plated beautifully and the flavors shone through. Too often when you eat out even in healthy places they drown everything in sodium which I can't stand. 

Love the fact they have rotating specials just like Tender Greens. Will definitely pop by now that I've discovered this gem!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try FARMR and finally got the chance to tonight. I ordered the Little Farmr (1 protein, 1 base and 1 side) which was the perfect sized dinner meal for me. I had just come from a workout and was looking for something healthy and tasty and this really hit the mark!! I ordered via Ritual and my food was ready to go when I arrived. The inside is super cute and goes with the whole farm to table concept/theme. Living in the area I would love to come back and dine-in. I ordered the hay roasted chicken with chimichurri sauce (amazing!), the smashed new potatoes and the root slaw. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Update
They have a wifi password now: farmresplanade.

They change up the menu every month or so, I've been told. 

They also have a bar, so if you're craving some wine/beer/cider... or if you're in the mood for some kombucha, you have some options! 

Love the homey food options here!"}
{"text":"I order off here on Ritual often at work and they always accommodate to my \"veganized\" orders. Appreciate the insightfulness of the items they replaced to make the meal vegan!

Food is great, however, the chickpea fritters were a little on the salty side (maybe I had a bad batch) but service is always top notch! Be sure to get the mushroom, kale, cracked wheat and sweet potato."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot with excellent farm to fresh fare. Good for vegetarians too. Try the lentil and chickpea patties!"}
{"text":"This is a review for their catering. We ordered food from here for my sister-in-law's baby shower and we were all so impressed with the food! 

The delivery arrived exactly on time and all the items came in containers with sign cards which was nice for guests to know what was what. 

We ordered the hay roasted chicken, lentil & chickpea fritter, roasted sweet potato, cabbage and lentils, beet and feta salad and ontario mushrooms & kale. 

The chicken was so perfectly cooked. It was tender and flavourful. The chimichurri sauce that came with it was light and had just the right amount of herbs and garlic but didn't overpower the chicken. 

The chickpea fritters were incredibly delicious! It was moist and not the least bit oily.

The veggies dishes we had ordered all tasted very fresh and delicious. Everyone raved about how the food was healthy but was still really tasty. One girl even said she would want to order from here for her office. 

I would 100% recommend ordering food from Fam'r as the ingredients are fresh and you can taste the care and passion put into each and every dish. 

It's also walking distance from my workplace so I will be coming here for lunch when the weather is warmer :)"}
{"text":"This review is actually for their catering - though I hope to visit their store when I can, based on my pleasant experience of their food at the event I attended.

I can't speak to their value as I don't know what was paid; however it was at a fundraiser for a not-for-profit and we were informed that they provided a great deal as a result - so they earn points for that.

Before I was aware of their approach and values (local sourced, healthy, seasonal, etc...) I could taste it in the food. All the ingredients had a natural freshness and taste about them, and though the food was well prepared and seasoned, the quality of the food itself is what stood out.

I was very fortunate that a lot of food was available, so I was able to have 3 proteins (don't judge) of salmon, roast beef and lentil and chickpea fritters. Each were near perfect, and though I'm not a vegetarian, it's actually the fritters that I'm dying to try again. The salmon was wonderful and I was very impressed out how tender and properly cooked the roast beef was. It's not too common in my experience to have great roast beef at a catered event (when the food is transported).

And on the subject of vegetarian dishes, how is it that the root veggie slaw and beet and feta salad are also vividly in my mind? Everyone at my table and earshot were quite vocal with their satisfaction in the food.

If you're looking for catering, I would certainly recommend that you look more into FARMR. Though I can't speak to the food at their restaurant, I would feel very comfortable directing people to it based on such a positive experience I had."}
{"text":"We were very satisfied when we went to this place. The price is reasonable. The food is simple, yet diverse food combinations packed with complementary flavours, fresh and organic. The energy in the place was amazing. The staff and service are wonderful, they are warm, friendly and helpful and also serve the food fast which make the guest are so delighted. we would definitely go to this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch!  Really fresh and delicious!  The ordering process was quick and easy and there is a nice atmosphere.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! The team at Farmr focuses on simple, nutritious and tasty food that highlights in season items and it shows. Definitely recommend the brisket and the lentil and chickpea fritters are a nice alternative from meat.

I first had the food dining in, but have since ordered it for the office for lunch a few times and it's always a hit. Lunch boxes make it super simple and there's enough variety that everyone is happy. Cookies are great as well.

Nice to see businesses focusing on simple, nutritious and affordable food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and will definitely come back. It's a hidden gem (at least for now). 
We shared a family platter and a little farmr so that we could sample everything. I highly recommend the brisket and smoked trout. The taste was flavourful and unique. 
The beet and feta side was also great. Definitely won't be my only visit!"}
{"text":"This is a reasonably affordable good BBQ eatery located close to st.lawrence market that's a little hidden (gem), you can easily walk pass it so keep your eyes open!

I didn't give 5 stars because I wasn't impressed with the beef brisket, it wasn't juicy/fatty enough. It was smoked that the outside was dry and inside was a bit moist. it wasn't bad cuz there was a nice tomato salsa on top but it just wasn't to my standards.

I love the healthy variety that they have for the base and sides. 

and honestly the Patio with the lights on at night makes a cute date night spot! their drink selection will quench every picky person from tea to beer!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. They have picnic benches outside for seating as well if no indoor space available. Location is convenient right next to St Lawrence mkt. Went here for brunch. We got lucky and got a table for six quite easily. You have to order & pay up front and then they will serve your order to your seat. Food is pretty decent. It's a fairly new spot that opened up in 2017 and they do catering as well."}
{"text":"There's a \"NY resolution\" sale, i.e. healthy food, on Ritual right now (January 2018), so I decided that rather than wasting precious studying time buying groceries and cooking stuff that my partner and I don't enjoy eating anyway, why not just order takeout from Farmr, which is just down the street. Last time I tried their weekend brunch and found the prices and portions very reasonable, and the flavors and nutritional value to my satisfaction. Dinner tonight was again 5/5 - the portion sizes were much bigger than I expected for takeout and I was genuinely surprised because previous Yelp reviews reflected the opposite! I ordered the Classic (usually $12.99, but Ritual discount right now!) and the small Farmr platter ($10.99). 

My favorite side was the roasted cauliflower with pear and almonds (vegan)! It's actually served cold and the slightly crispy cauliflower plus vinaigrette and sweet notes from the pear work so well together! The seasonal veggie slaw btw probably contains dairy in the dressing I'm sure, since it's so creamy. The vegetarian lentil chickpea protein patties were hearty, but flavor-wise very bland and they were so dry... Disappointing. The beets/feta/pumpkin seed salad was faultless and has a wonderful slightly creamy, melt-y overall texture from the cheese. The smashed potatoes also looked pretty appetizing and well seasoned (I didn't try though - sometimes I judge a dish by the cover).

Farm'r, you may have become my new I'm-too-lazy/busy-to-cook solution!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem in the St Lawrence Market tucked into a quiet corner Farmr Eatery is a unique place.  With its rustic, contemporary and farm-to-table type of place it was something both Jen and I wanted to try out. 
Focusing on local, seasonal ingredients their menu and motto is to keep things fun, simple and seasonal.  
We both decided to sit in their lovely yet cozy patio area. 
As for food we, in keeping things light before our ACTUAL dinner we tried out their Roasted sweet potatoes, Brisket and beet feta salad.  
Their prices are quite reasonable and the shareable portion was more than enough.
Their service was very helpful as we were not sure what to order in addition they came back every so often to ask if we needed anything.
I'll definitely be back to Farmr as they've got other great dishes :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere. I tried the red potato salad and couldn't stop telling my husband how great it is. The staff are very friendly and inviting. I will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch and loved it. Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious. They are true to their farm to table concept which is awesome.

Liked the coffee - very smooth. 
Service was friendly and prompt considering it was brunch.

They did a nice job with the brisket. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm not writing this to be mean or to dump on a neighborhood business, and I know trying to run a restaurant is difficult but the food we received tonight via our Ritual order was terrible. We both ordered turkey meatballs and the taste of cumin was overpowering, so much so that I couldn't finish my order. I have some understanding of seasoning and spice but the flavor was so out of whack that all we could taste was cumin. It was honestly disgusting and after a few bites we had to abandon our meals.

I don't know how someone can ruin a salad but the dressing suffered the same lack of balance, it was vinegar upon vinegar and virtually inedible. The amount of food we have to throw away is a real shame. Not only for the money we wasted but because wasting this much food really isn't right.  We tried to eat as much as we could and just couldn't stomach any more. I don't understand how salad dressing can be this off putting but it was. My apartment now reeks of vinegar just from our attempt to eat our salads.

I understand a business can have an off day but I can't remember the last time I was unable to finish a meal, not because I was full, but because it tasted so bad. I don't feel good about writing this review but I think people should understand what they could be in store for if they eat here and if their experience is anywhere close to ours."}
{"text":"Had brunch: frittata and salad. The frittata was pre-made and lukewarm. The salad was a handful of greens without dressing.

EDIT: owner contacted me to apologize for my experience and offered a free meal to compensate me, hence the four stars. Good show!"}
{"text":"This is a new spot for healthy, hearty, farm-to-table kind of the food.  All the ingredients are sourced within 100km of Toronto.  You can create a classic FARMR plate for $12.99 (one protein base, one base, and two sides).  They also have seasonal dishes that is not on the menu.  Roasted cauliflower salad tastes so amazing especially with shaved pear in it.  The portion is BIG!

There are a lot of similar spots opening up in downtown recent years but this is by far the least pretentious place.  And their food actually tastes delicious and homey!

Love love this place!  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A quaint restaurant in the Esplanade.  Came here on a rainy saturday night for dinner with a couple of friends.  

I ordered the Classic plate consisting of the brisket, smashed potatoes, red cabbage slaw and the beet and feta salad.  The beef was tender and well-seasoned.  The tomato bbq sauce complimented the meat quite well.  The red cabbage slaw was mediocre, I was a bit disappointed by the apple's texture within the slaw though.  They were soft and mushy and I was expecting crisp and crunchy.  The smashed potatoes were fairly standard so no complaints there.  The beet salad was above my expectations,  the pumpkin seeds really helped elevate the salad.  Overall quite delicious and better yet, I don't feel the shame after eating the brisket due to the healthy sides they offer.  

Would definitely come back when I'm craving bbq yet something light."}
{"text":"Order the main plate i got the chicken ,beets ,salad and sweet potato . Really tasty well priced homestyle meals, a nice addition to the esplanade!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference and wanted a nice healthy spot to eat dinner. I ordered take out from FARMR about 15-20 mins in advance on their site before hopping in an Uber to pick it up. When I got there, the staff ignored me for a few minutes until I made eye contact with someone at the register. Whatever. So I grabbed my food and left the spot to go home and eat my food in peace. It smelled great in the bag, but as soon as I got home and looked inside the container, I knew immediately that it wouldn't taste as delicious as it smelled. 

The Lentil & Chickpea Fritters were SO salty and dry. The Brussel Sprout and Red Cabbage side had a couple of Brussel sprout leaves in it, but no whole brussel sprouts to be found. This item was also topped off with a soggy unidentifiable fruit (possibly canned).

Needless to say, I couldn't get through the entire meal, but I wouldn't go back to FARMR nor recommend."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Met 2 girlfriends here for dinner and was delighted to learn that Monday is $20 for a bottle of wine. On this hot summery night, we really appreciated the crisp and dry rosé, which like all their wines is from Ontario. 

Their motto is basically seasonal, local and scratch-made. The garlic cheese bread is to die for! Between us we sampled the Chef's Filipino special (afraid the name escapes me), ribs, beet & feta salad, asparagus & fennel salad, roasted sweet potato and eggplant dish. All were declared as delicious! 

We will definitely all return and have agreed to make this our new regular meeting spot!"}
{"text":"Overall, could be much BETTR. Maybe next time.

DELIVERY REVIEW: via UBEREATS

I got the Classic Farmr which is 1 protein, 1 base, and 2 sides. 

Protein: 
- The 12-hour smoked brisket was not tender and in fact, quite chewy. Definitely didn't meet my standards for a brisket and the portion size of the protein relative to the sides was on the smaller side. Don't come here looking for good BBQ - maybe their other proteins are bettr.

Base:
- I chose salad greens, which was a bed of baby greens - no complaints here.

Sides:
- The seasonal root vegetable coleslaw was mediocre and the pieces were so big, it felt like I was biting into a head of cabbage (this might be a slight exaggeration.)
- The mushroom, kale, and cracked wheat was the best thing in the combo (although that's not saying much) 

I also got the daily soup which was a miso ginger butternut squash - it was OK.

I'm not saying I'll nevr come back or order again, but maybe not until FARMR is more established."}
{"text":"Healthy, fresh, and affordable! You'll feel good after eating lunch here - great to takeaway or eat-in. Their interior has a farm-like feel (makes sense...!) and the patio is very quaint. Staff are also extremely friendly! I ordered the chicken, salad, coleslaw, and kale with mushrooms (Classic FARMR, good portion size). The chicken was cold, which was my only disappointment, but the tomato sauce on it was really tasty! Coleslaw has a strong mustard taste, and very fresh. The kale with mushrooms was probably the best part of the meal and something I hope to mimic at home. My friend ordered the meatballs which were also on the cold side, but lean and tasty too. They have seasonal specials online so check them out before heading over! Happy to see this local business thriving - will be back."}
{"text":"The kale and mushroom salad was amazing!  The staff was very nice and the service was so fast.  I'd highly recommend coming to this new spot.  Would be great after a trip to the St. Lawerence market."}
{"text":"Chimchurri chicken awesome... meatballs awesome..
The wait on Wednesday for the chicken was excruciatingly long. Was offered free baked goods, didn't accept.
,was a nice touch, rarely seen in today's mediocre restaurant industry.
Portion size, wish it was a bit bigger. 
Roasted cauliflower was cold(?) not sure if that's how the side is supposed to be or because of my wait on Wednesday. 
Thursday wasn't busy at all... 
drinks except for coffee and water, no other options for low calorie/low carb.
Would I go again, I did, even after my wait on Wednesday... I went back to try the meatballs.
Price $$$ vs st Lawrence market $$ right next door 
Staff ultra friendly big plus
Portions a could be a bit bigger"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! 

The menu is a bit lean but this place offers something for everyone from vegetarian, fish to meat lovers. The two of us ordered the beef brisket and turkey meatball to share. Each of us get to choose two sides and everything was absolutely delicious.

The place has both indoor and patio sitting. You would order up front and the servers would bring your food to your table after.

The price point is right for the quality of food they are offering. The two of us spent a total of 30 doles plus tips. 

I will definitely recommend this place to everyone if you are in the St. Lawerence market area! What a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. I feel so bad too because I was so overwhelmed I forgot to leave gratuity on the table, which was well deserved. I will surely return and make up for it."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new restaurant on the Esplanade. Really bright, airy interior, and a fairly large side patio. You can combine different bases, sides, and proteins to make your meal. Everything we ordered was delicious! Tasted healthy yet satisfying - wouldn't have changed a thing with our meal. The menu is simple but there are enough options for everyone. 

Service was great, and they also serve beer and wine. Can't wait to come back to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for affordable delicious healthy options - this should become your go-to! It's like getting your favorite home-made dishes every time you go! 
Food is incredible - I got the farmr plate with steak , chicken, grains and salad and have also tried various specials.

Easily 5 stars"}
