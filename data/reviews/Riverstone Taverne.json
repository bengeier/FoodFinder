{"text":"Came to the new location for dinner on a Saturday evening.  The decor is really comfortable and inviting.  We had a bottle of zinfandel, I had the prime rib and my wife had the filet mignon.  Both dinners arrived pretty quickly and both were delicious!   The garlic mashed potatoes were perfectly done.  We had apple pie and ice cream for dessert and that was excellent as well!   The service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Was there in late January.  Service was excellent.  The waitress was very attentive and helpful in my deciding between some menu offerings.  The shrimp dinner was great. My husband had a steak and said it, too, was very good.   I have been there several times, and plan on returning!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss the old atmosphere & charm the old location brought, now I feel like I'm at just your average American restaurant. (Anywhere in the country)   Even though the new location is lacking charm, I still do enjoy all my favorites on their menu. Such as their fried pickles, prime rib, sirloin steaks, the Ruben sandwich and the buffalo ranch salad really hits the spot.  The staff is always really attentive, involved and cheerful which greatly makes my dining experiences that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience last night! From the drinks and appetizer(we had fried pickles)! We order a bunch of the mini sandwiches, (montaditios) We really enjoyed the PIB fish ones and prime rib was excellent! We also had a terrific server..I dont remember her name:( We sat on heated covered patio, it was relalxing, comfortable and yummy!  So happy to have found this little gem not too from us! We just moved back to Ohio from Chicago, which is a culinary dream palace, So we are so happy to have found a place to go grab good drinks and even better food! We will be back. I have a feeling we'll be craving those mini sandwiches;)"}
{"text":"I was a regular, when riverstone was located in valley city.  I visited there new location for an early dinner.  The service was slow and the wait for our meal was long.  The food was not as good as it was in valley city but not bad. The ambiance although was nice the noise level was loud. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"No charm. Sits in a shopping plaza. Food is frozen, you can tell. No creativity in what they do."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our experience. We ordered the pierogies as an appetizer, the tavern pasta and prime rib sandwich for our entrees. Both meals were very good and prices were average. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with today's visit to the new location. The booths were disappointing for a new place being that they were just plywood bottoms and backs. Not a cozy feel like the previous location.   However, the decor and everything is alright.  We had a party of ten. Service was friendly but just average. Saturday night and they were out of calamari as well as filet. Ordered the (special) prime rib. It was below average. All the entr√©es ordered tasted like char from the grill.   The food runner kid wears gym shorts and a t-shirt.  Two people at our table we're satisfied but definitely not blown away by the overall experience.  Would I ever go back? Probably. Only because it's one minute from home plus it's new and I know first hand the restaurant biz is brutally tough to click on all cylinders at all times!  I hope they can improve! I will monitor their reviews and see if things get better. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Arrived about 7pm. They were not very crowded. It took longer than it should have for our food to arrive considering I got the meatloaf and Mac and Cheese and my wife ordered spaghetti. Salads are extra. The food was pretty good and portions were decent. Our waiter was nice and seemed to know the menu pretty well. I would not suggest going on Tuesday night at 7pm though if you don't like Karaoke. Back to back to back horrible singing took away from the experience."}
{"text":"If I could give you a 0, I would. I called and made a reservation for 6 people at 7pm. We show up a few minutes before 7 and they tell us our table isn't quite ready and that it'll be a few minutes. No biggie. We wait outside while grandma and mom stay inside.  It gets to be about 715 and still no table. I go inside and mom tells me that this party of 10 just came into the restaurant asking how long the wait would be. The manager asks if they have a reservation and they said no. The manager says ok.... You will be seated in about 20 min.....hmmm strange bc we made reservations and we still were not told when out table would be ready.  Then the manager sees me and tells me that he is so sorry but he is unable to accommodate us tonight bc the table he has for us is still occupied....yet he has a table to accommodate the large party of 10???YOU COULD SEE THE FLAMES COME OUT OF MY EARS.  That schmuck of a manager offered us a $20 gift card which I trashed as soon as I got home.   We are all for supporting local businesses but when managers do not treat customers with respect, it's hard to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Wonderful evening! My husband tried the BBQ ribs for the first time, even tho we were a little leery, because we have our favorite place for BBQ. We're a little picky! :-)He ordered the full slab, expecting to take home leftovers...well..Let me just say, there wasn't much left to take home.lol. They were outstanding! Service was excellent and you can't beat the Wednesday wine special. Can't wait to come back and try something else new."}
{"text":"Had the Filet Medallions, very tender, juicy and delicious. Try the garlic mashed potatoes. Not overly garlicky, just right. The Apple pie was very good also, Good value."}
{"text":"Great little place. We almost did not go due to the bad reviews here, but I'm glad we decided to give it a try. I've never been to any other location so I can't compare, but had no complaints--thought it was very nice ambiance actually. Our server Kelly was very attentive and prompt. The food and cocktail quality was very good and the prices seemed appropriate. Appetizers and drinks came very quickly but the entrees did take a little longer. Still not an issue. Looking forward to returning for happy hour sometime."}
{"text":"Poor service and low quality food. Have been 3 times and each time it has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner and was really impressed!  I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my husband had the mac and cheese. Both were delicious and the staff was very nice/attentive!"}
{"text":"Danielle and I had gone to the Riverstone Taverne when it was at it's old location in Valley City (where Galdolf's is now). at the time, i was not terribly impressed except for the outside dining patio.  since they've now moved to the little Drug Mart shopping center in Brunswick Hills that pretty patio is gone. however, the food was much more impressive tonight. while Danielle's \"fish fry\" dinner was obviously a frozen preformed fish patty but she claimed it was fried perfectly. I got the Chicken Marsala and it was delicious. the sauce was loaded with mushrooms. the potatoes, while a bit \"dry\", tasted really good. as a side i got the crispy brussell sprouts - my favorite part of the meal. the meal was served with a bread stick that i will admit wasn't very good. it was dry and it seemed obviously microwaved. additionally, neither of us was blown away by our sauerkraut balls we got as an appetizer. not bad, but we've had better.  at this time, i'm really looking forward to going back again for more of that chicken marsala."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and the food was really very good, for the most part. The ranch dressing is perfect with the homemade chips!  The sweet potato chips are THE best I've ever had!    The only reason my review is 4 rather than 5 is my burger. I got the Dublin. Corn beef on top with Swiss. I actually had to ask if it was just simple deli ham. It sure tasted like ham too. It actually took away from the burger. I'm sure if they used a higher grade of corned beef it would have been very good but what I had was more ham like.   I would have personally preferred a toasted bun. I could see they put my bun on the grill from the grill marks but it was a cold, not at all toasted bun that seemed to lack that special touch a good burger has!"}
{"text":"WE Have been a patrons shortley after its opening.Riverstone started out great went through a few changes as all establishments do but just haven't been happy with it lately. Pros: Has a nice porch which serves those of us who like to be outdoors but is covered enough for those who don't like sitting outdoors to eat. Wine Dinners affordable and deliscious. Cons: Menu has been revamped for the upteenth time! Just when I get used to one menu and look forward to new items with specials they revamp the entire menu. Looks like they are cutting back on food quality as well the last few times the food was mediocre at best. Food prices no longer match the quality or lack of it. Used to like the host at the door since he recognized us after a couple of visits and would be sure to seat us with our favorite waitress,not so the past three times Carlos is no longer greeting us at the door and his replacement not only hasn't recognized us or honored our requested wait person but will leave you hanging at the door while he flaps around until he is ready to look at the front door sometimes as long as 5+minutes.Not good. Constructive criticism to the owner is returned with blank looks and defensive remarks,no apologies or changes...we will be on the lookout for another spot to end our summer drives.Also why can't I get a decent Bloody Mary the martinis are usually too sweet before dinner and pack too much of a wallop to have before a drive home."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place before when it was at its old location.  I am disappoint with this place now.  I went for lunch and the menu selection was very limited.  The hamburger was the only thing interesting and that was $10.00 with a small amount of slaw.  it was not that great.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Nice local spot.  The food was quite good.  Service was prompt.  The space is very cramped."}
{"text":"First time stopping in but the menu looked great and they had stuffed Cabbage , It was a little bright at the bar and the menu had way to much going on in the back ground but I ordered Bartender was nice but....... Stuffed Cabbage wasn't  hot but I pressed on bartender never came back to check on me and couldn't flag her down with all 6 of us at the bar guess she was swamped... by the time i got to my second cabbage the center was cold so when bartender saw the plate she finally stopped I told her the issue she said she was sorry never had a manager come by didn't discount the bill nothing ...... I won't be back"}
{"text":"New location atcorner of rt303 & Marks Road is much better that old location  plenty of seating room and not as crowded  Service very attentive and friendly  plenty of choices on the menu  Pulled pork sandwiches, mile high meatloaf, perch dinner, & ruben all very tasty snd reasonably priced.  Willvisit this place more often."}
{"text":"Bad service,overcharged,bad food,bad atmosphere. We had the Salmon Wellington,which was very tasteless. It came with potatoes with truffle oil on it & some other things which looked like dirty rice or whatever else you would like to call it. Sat in a very dark corner at a table that was too small for two people to eat at & then on top of it they OVERCHARGED US,WHICH MADE US VERY ANGRY. We will not be going there anytime soon again. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you want bad service,tasteless food,& like being overcharged for something that you said was one price on the menu then they added extra monies probably for their pocket."}
{"text":"New look same average food.  I miss the old place where they could at least keep up with the customer's food and drink orders."}
{"text":"This was a lunch stop.   The place has a modest sized lunch.  The regular menu has offerings where sandwich comes with chips.   These are thin slices deep fried, not necessarily the best thing.   Go for the extra price for fries, they are shoestring and fresh made.   I tried montaditos. Theses are baguettes filled with a small amount of different meats.   They are good but not enough meat and when dressed with mayo or sauce you lose taste of meat.   Burger is a safe bet.   Fresh meat and decent size.  The food comes out a little slow but is good.   Maybe dinner offers more but it's trashy about two and a half stars.   Had really good server"}
{"text":"New location, bad chain like interior, really loud.  Same average food and poor service attitude.  Sad they lost all the character of the old place with only a new interior in exchange."}
{"text":"New location, no atmosphere, really loud, same average food and poor service attitude.  Tonight I felt like we were an in convince to our waitress."}
{"text":"Very long wait! Had to stand next to the men's room to wait for a table for at least 40 minutes because the bar was full and no other seating available. The food was great though. We had bacon wrapped sausage appetizer, a salad (delicious balsamic salad dressing) and the meatloaf dinner. Large portions...had to take the rest home! Would have given 5 stars if we didn't have to stand next to the men's room that long to wait!"}
{"text":"Walked in got a seat right away...  sat there for about 5-10 minutes before anyone showed up to take our drink order..  Waitress was very pleasant , funny.. ..   Once we were on her radar she took care of us great..    order spinach dip it was very good.. the problem was that they only give you enough pitas and chips to eat about half of dip.. so we asked the waitress for more pitas or chips or even just tortilla chips..  She said that she would have to charge us for it.. well right there my rating went straight down.. never been at a place that they charge for a few extra chips.. thought that was crazy.   On a side note.. the waitress looked embarrassed too.. she offered us some soup crackers... lol.. nice gesture.. actually felt bad for her....  Got the mac n cheese.. very thick..  kid didn't touch it other kid got a salad.. she enjoyed it wife a got some sort of chicken salad.. she had no complaint I got the buckeye burger.. it was very good.. the bread they put it on seemed a little stale though.. wish it was just a regular hamburger bun.. its was some sort of thinnish  (sp)chabbatta bread.  Also, fries were extra.. I think the burger was $11..  I'd think fries would come with that .. but maybe I'm just cheap..  Anyhow, not sure we will go back.. undecided"}
{"text":"Why is it that some people think that their three-year-old should be allowed to sit at the bar while they are waiting for their table?! We were finishing up our dinner when this small child with his toys starts climbing up on the bar stool. Parents thought it was cute. Bartender said nothing. Bye forever."}
{"text":"We love this place. The atmosphere is awesome. The bartender Lori is fantastic and super friendly. We love the happy hour specials. Our favorite things are the grilled chicken salads and the homemade boneless Wings."}
{"text":"Bruce, the owner, called me to apologize for his staff taking my table away even though I had reserved it one month in advance for a very special occasion.  He assured me that this is not common practice at Riverstone Tavern.  He also said he realized that his apology was late, but he was just made aware of the issue today(6 weeks later).  I appreciate his contacting me, and his apology.  He assured me he would make certain the staff understands how best to deal with these situations in the future.  I accepted his apology and wished him well."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about their new place. They moved from Valley City to this new location. The new place is clean, modern and open but feels a little sterile. I miss the character and ambiance of the old place.   It was a Saturday night and the new place was packed, so I guess they are getting more traffic flow then Valley City, but I am not sure the staff can handle the extra business. We waited just over 45 minutes for our food and the drinks were slow to be replenished while we were waiting, but we made the best of our very long wait. We actually had a great time (husband's birthday with six of us celebrating). But, if I was just with my husband and waited 45 minutes for my food I would not have been happy. I saw two other tables that were obviously annoyed at the slow service. Our waitress was very friendly and tried to be helpful, but she seemed to be a little overwhelmed. Don't know if it was the kitchen, or the bar staff or her, but I felt like I just wanted to get up and help her. Maybe they were just short staffed that night. One of the reasons we would try this restaurant again is because our waitress was so nice. Personality really does count when working with customers. Wait staff can make or break a restaurant and in this case it may have saved it.   The food quality was mixed. Among the six of us, some people like what they got and others did not. The jambalaya special was very tasty and they served a large portion size, but others dishes were so-so to not-so-good. The prime rib special was an over cooked, over salted thin slice of meat and expensive for a strip mall type restaurant. We will go back and give them another chance. Maybe it is just growing pains and they will get better. I hope so!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! I have always had an exceptional meal from the Riverstone Tavern. The burgers are great, pasta is amazing and appetizers are delicious. My favorite entree is the Mile High Meatloaf and if you are looking for a challenge, try the Meatloaf Challenge! They use quality ingredients and most of it is brought in locally. They always have a good selection of beer including most of the seasonal beers from Great Lakes Brewing Co. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. I would recommend the Riverstone to anyone and everybody."}
{"text":"Excellent!! The chicken paprikash soup was out of this world... bread was amazing, the Cajun shrimp pasta was spicy, creamy and not fishy although the andouille had a bit of a beef stick bite to it. Beer selection wasn't bad and the wine selection was excellent. The Cuban sandwich was delicious as was the wedge salad. Nobody was disappointed with their meals. I think our waitress may have been on another planet but the food made up for the weird service. It wasn't bad... Just .... She was a strange bird. And the flies were annoying the entire time and never seemed to go away...while we were inside. Highly recommend for some good food in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"First visit here and had the Margarita Chicken and Blue Devil chopped sirloin. Both were very, very good. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great service!  Dustin was fun and attentive.. Excellent food!  Turkey Panini - best ever!  Burger grilled to perfection!"}
{"text":"Nice place, stoped in this weekend. We had a bunch of the appetizers. Fried pickles, bruschetta, sauerkraut balls & loaded potato chips.   The chips were amazballs! By far our favorite, they come with bacon, cheddar cheese and a homemade ranch dipping sauce, definitely try these when you go there!   The bruschetta was good, it comes separated and you build it yourself, which is slightly annoying, but not a big problem. The bread was so light and tasty.   The fried pickles were equally good, but very salty.   Sauerkraut balls were ok, very heavy and filling.   Each item came with a homemade dipping sauce which were very good. We just had appetizers, this time but will be back for some entrees. The server was very helpful and funny as well. We got lucky that the appetizers were 1/2 price, normal prices are a little on the high side, but nothing too crazy."}
{"text":"Took a shot and was very happy with our choice!! Jason was a great server!! I had the french dip, Best I ever had!! My wife had the boneless wings with bourbon orange sauce and they were very good...I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch yesterday. It was my first visit since it moved last year.  It is now located in a plaza next to Drug Mart so lacks the charm it had at previous location. That being said, the warmth from the crew inside still remains the same.   I ordered the grilled Caesar and sauerkraut balls and both exceeded my expectations. My friend got the mild wings. We were both very happy with our choices. The food is still very good and server and service was great. Still continues to be a favorite when I am in the area."}
