{"text":"Nous avons essayé le Pollo a la parilla (poulet grillé) et le Ropa vieja (effiloché de boeuf). Très bons plats style maison avec un service très chaleureux et rapide. Allez l'essayer, les assiettes sont généreuses. Je recommande le riz \"noir\" aromatisé et avec des haricots noirs."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident while visiting the open market. I'm American but my family is originally from Cuba.   We tried the croquettes, Ropa Vieja, Cuban Sandwich.... all were excellent but what really took the cake was a dish called \"Bandeja Paisa.\" It's a mix of different foods... to die for.  I will definitely be visiting this place again when I'm back in Montreal.   Leave room for the Flan with Queso!"}
{"text":"We have been here many, many times! The food is excellent, but nothing tops their amazing service. The server is outstanding; thoughtful, efficient and passionate. We strongly recommend you try their tres leches cake at the end of your meal, or as a snack with one of their delicious coffees. We feel very welcome here, and will continue to come often!"}
