{"text":"Had our engagement luncheon today. Food was amazing,service exceptional. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to host a special occasion. Thank you Milena and Marco, we had a great time and will remember our day with fond memories of the delicious food and gracious hosts."}
{"text":"Avlyn Gardens has been open just 3 weeks. They have fixed up an old tea house on the main street of Kleinburg and created a charming, mildly upscale restaurant. From the front you will see only a cottage, but in the back is a smart little light-filled dining room and a large shady patio. We sat outside for lunch on a warm day but were comfortable in the shade overlooking a large greenery-filled backyard with huge maple trees.  The food is modern Italian: hand-made thin crust pizza (I would say Neapolitan style) with simple, high-quality ingredients, plus the other usual suspects: risotto, veal, and a few good appetizers and desserts. Our party of four tried the pineapple shrimp appetizer, two pizzas and the asparagus risotto. Everything was very tasty and prepared perfectly. The service was friendly and professional.  This is a welcome addition to the dining options in Kleinburg and I would recommend it for visitors who want a casually elegant lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went: Fri May 29 2015, 6:00 pm Ordered: lobster pasta and arugula salad Cost: incl. tax and tip $35-40  On tripadvisor.ca, this was the No. 1 restaurant in Kleinburg and No. 2 in Vaughan. Unfortunately, they spell it wrong. It has 37 reviews, yet in Yelp it only has 4 including mine. I wonder why.  We tried eating here a week before without a reservation but it was too busy. There weren't that many other restaurants in Kleinburg which is a contrast to Unionville which has so many.   Food: The food was delicious and slightly better than other 4 star restaurants I've been too. The pasta was al dente which my girlfriend and I were not used to. However, the salad was deliciious.  Environment:  The service was excellent and stood out. My girlfriend recommends that you don't ask the server for recommendation, otherwise, he'll go through each item on the menu. We also thought the waiting staff was very attentive. Being attentive and pampering is very important to her. ;)  Bottom line: I would definitely come back. This is 4.5 stars. I'm rounding down to 4 because it is only slightly better than my other 4 star meals."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my husband and I went to Avlyn Gardens to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This was our first visit to this restaurant but certainly not the last. The food was amazing, we had sea bream fillets and lamb chops, everything was cooked to perfection. The service was very good, though a bit on a slow side. We love Kleinberg and often go there for a walk in the Bindertwine park or/and dinner. We tried few restaurants in Kleinberg (incl. famous Doctors House - though, we were cheap and went there when they had a Groupon, so may be it affected their cooking quality), but I think Avlyn Gardens is the best in Kleinberg, or at least the best we tried so far."}
{"text":"In charming historic Kleinburg, a quaint, former tea house, is now the home of exquisite Italian cuisine. Linguine with shrimp, king crab, scallops, mussels and clams is served in a baked focaccia bowl. Portions are generous, pricing is gentle, and flavours are out of this world. A plate of grilled meats includes the most tender lamb, fennel sausage and beef striploin served with demi glace and fresh rosemary. Risotto is perfectly al dente, and comes with a half lobster tail, shrimp, clams and mussels in wine and tomato. We want to taste everything on the menu. Our servers are so warm and inviting, we linger over one more espresso, one more biscotti, one more chamomile infused grappa..."}
{"text":"This place is now only open for functions.  No review. I am just gonna give its average star, so I could write and doesn't affect the rating too much.    Over the years, I tried to try this place 3 times.  Twice, it was closed when we went. Third time, I called about 5 weeks ago, the answering machine said it is open for functions only.  Heard good things about their food.  Too bad I never get to taste it."}
{"text":"Cute place in the Vaughn/kleinberg area. Definitely a must check out.  We had a set course meal, I'm not sure how it compares to the menu. But I can tell you that it is amazing and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have lunch or dinner. The radicchio salad was well dressed and very satisfying. The fried calamari & shrimp were cooked to perfection......very soft, crispy and tasty! They also serve warm bread along with their signature artichoke dip. You will want to ask for seconds!! It's to die for!! The servers were lots of fun and well informed. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was honestly skeptical and expected overpriced spaghetti or an overly oily and salty Italian pizza with portions that would only fill a mouse, but what we got that lunch was surprisingly light, full of flavor, and okay portions. Price was fair. I think it helps that this restaurant's store front is very very small. But i think they're focusing on catering and big events, which they hold in the back. Call to confirm what they're doing that day"}
{"text":"I found Avlyn Gardens to be a good restaurant, but not great given the price.  I started off with the lentil soup, which was very good. For my main course I went with the beef fillets with a salad. Both were excellent.  I found that the service was not all that great - the waiter made it seem like we were a bit of an imposition. Granted,w e were a large group, but even still, you shouldn't end up feeling that way.  Overall, it was a good experience, but I don't think I'd go back."}
