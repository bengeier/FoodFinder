{"text":"Great food. Great service. But the cooking is very slow. Other than that, amazing. Once I ordered all salmon and it is the best salmon I have ever tried. I recommend all sushi lovers Ichiban Sushi House."}
{"text":"Ichiban's sushi is actually pretty good and their pricing is also great but my beef with this place lies with the wait staff. They have pretty terrible service, I had to get up a couple of time. They are also pretty stingy and cheap."}
{"text":"They do an all you can eat lunch.   The food was very clean and fresh.  However they kept shorting our order.   You order 2 rolls, they only brought one.  You order four pices of beef rib they bring 2.  It was a joke.   We waited 20 minutes for them to take our 2nd order.   And then never brought it out  They never came out to refill the tea.   We ended telling the server to cancel the order as we had to go.     Overall the service killed the lunch.  Was not the first time I have been disappointed by the service here.  Most likley the last time ."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. You definitely do not get what you pay for as there are much better places within walking distance such as sushi one or sushi moto. First and definitely last time."}
{"text":"i am a regular here...so i think i will write a review about this place...my husband office is close to this reataurant thats why he tried this place and took me there oftenly because he is a big fan of this place and after i tried it, im a fan too :)...i love sushi, i love japanese foods and i can tell when the taste is just not right..and this place have authentic japanase foods.I usually order sushi(red roll or green roll) or if i was hungry i ordered the bento box, u got miso soup, tempura, rice, dumpling, rib or salmon or teriyaki beef or chicken teriyaki..ur choice :)...the bento was around 16-17 dollars, the sushi was around 8-15 dollar... the place was nice, not too crowded so its really good for me since i have toddler..u know they are moving around every 5 seconds..i think its because the place is a lil bit hidden thats why not all people can see and know about this place and one more: the customers who like japanese foods are not as many as in toronto...thats the circumstances... i live in alliston and i always go down to newmarket to have jap food in ichiban :).... so u can try and prove it urself.how good is it..food was flawless...service was excellent, owner was really down to earth...he always came to our table just to say hi...and i think its really sweet of him i definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone...especially when u have toddler, kids, big family and u want to eat delicious foods without worrying about ur kid will be running here and there..they absolutely have space and washroom was clean too....nyummmm im going there tomorrowwww...:)...."}
{"text":"Great selection with very fresh ingredients. I go with friends and work colleagues somewhat regularly and on this particular occasion was with my husband. We were their first table in the new year and they gave us dragon rolls on the house! The waiter was very friendly and even performed magic tricks. Always clean, nice music and great food that comes pretty promptly."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  I used to enjoy dropping by the St. Clair location of Ichiban Sushi House at 1375 Yonge Street for lunch. I had not been there for 2 or 3 months, and I am shocked how the quality of food and service has declined.   * Sushi A lunch special $11: I've ordered this many times before. The restaurant was not busy, yet there was a long wait for the sushi to arrive. The 8 pieces of sushi were the smallest I've ever seen. They are about one-third the size they were in the past. The fish was cut as thinly as possible, in tiny pieces, over minuscule amounts of rice. The 6 pieces of California roll were also the smallest rolls I've ever seen. Pieces of the avocado were dark and discolored. Neither the fish nor the rice tasted fresh the way they did in the past. The fish was dry, and two of the pieces tasted off.   * Miso soup was hot, but was salty broth, not one piece of seaweed or tofu to be found.  * The soggy lettuce salad was neither cold nor crisp.  * The tea would not even qualify as lukewarm. The staff did not bother to check the temperature before serving it.  * Neither ice nor a lemon slice were offered for the small glass of lukewarm tap water.  * The staff were definitely not busy, yet they paid almost no attention to the few customers in the place, and were neither as efficient nor as friendly as the servers in the past  Total waste of money! The Ichiban restaurant chain has over 30 locations -- are they doing any quality control at all???"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service however is terrible (at lunch at least). Waitress is clueless how to coordinate and prioritize. I waited forever for my bill while she folded napkins. One hour for lunch is not nearly enough for how slow service is. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"These guys are rutheless there. The owner is pretty savage guy and servers, sushi bar chefs all very rude and pretty shitty overall. The have nice location thats why people are keep going. But other then location everything is pretty bad. Also price is very expensive too."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese restaurant run by Koreans.  Pro: - fresh sushi and sashimi. - I have tried almost everything on the menu. They are all pretty decent with the price you pay.   Cons: - The servers are sometimes absent minded."}
{"text":"This has been the worst sushi experience of my life. My friend is allergic to fish and they wouldn't let her switch her bento box sushi to a vegetarian roll. Isn't cucumber cheaper than fish? I don't understand what the issue is.  Also, Instead of politely telling her that she couldn't replace the fish. The server simply replied \"I can't do anything about it.\" Well I'll tell you what I'm gonna do about it. Give you a one star review.  Other flaws include overpriced average food, slow service, no wifi, and smooth jazz elevator music. Don't come here. You have been warned,"}
{"text":"I was forced to give this 1 star, when I really didn't want to rate them at all.  Keep in mind, I am NOT rating the food, but the HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service I received.  I have never had to write a review before, but I felt I had to after my last experience at this location. I have NEVER experienced such POOR, SLOW service at any restaurant I have been to, in comparison to this one. I had called 30 minutes in advance on a Friday for a bento box pickup, when arriving I was told I had to wait another 30 minutes for my \"pick up\" order. I get it, it was a busy Friday lunch hour, but what I didn't get, was the patrons who finished eating, were served before me, the walkins ordered and were also served before me. I think these new owners were picking and choosing who should be served (I was picking up 1 measly bento box!) I asked for refund, to which the server kept brushing me off. And when I finally caught her attention and said I was walking out, she said, \"oh, it's right here.\" I was pretty livid. I arrived back at work late from my lunch, only to discover -- no soya sauce. I have decided to boycott going to this location EVER AGAIN. I have since spread the word at my company for everyone to follow suit, removed them from my phone list, and have erased ever eating there from my memory."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this restaurant another chance.   I have to say not only does the udon taste like moth balls, the lady taking your reservation down sounds annoyed and exasperated when you request for a different seating area. When she gives you a different spot, it's like she is doing you a huge favour.   The young lady server wanted me to move my stroller, but we were given a tight spot. She also never gave me my wasabi so I had to go to sushi bar to ask for it. I also got looks of annoyance because of the stroller.   The young man server knew I ordered udon and even tho my husband got his food first, mine came out 10 mins after and the person who came after me got his food first. What gives?   If I could give Zero stars, I would. I gave them 3 extra chances because I went back thinking it was going to improve. But their attitude is terrible. No wonder there is nobody there on a Friday night. Be more pleasant. It's simple."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   This is a good sushi place with a get-down-to-business atmosphere. They do a great job of filling take out orders, and the hostess is usually extremely attendant and happy to serve you.  The sushi is very reasonably priced, and tastes fresh. Overall, you'll have a satisfying sushi experience and you won't pay too much if you order smartly.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Very cozy and quiet when we visited there during the weekday. Sashimi are fresh. Service is good. Price is reasonable. Will go back and try their bento box."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch. Friendly staff, were seated immediately. The spicy scallops roll is my favourite so had to try it here. It was delicious! All food was served fairly fast and was fresh and excellent in taste. Once food was served the service was very slow. We got ask if we wanted a refill of tea once - when we asked for the bill. Would have loved to have that tea much earlier than that. Price is higher end, some of the items seemed a bit overpriced. But the quality of food is excellent."}
{"text":"Food: The sashimi and sushi here are usually fresh, albeit on the pricy side. Non-sushi dishes (e.g. any sort of soup based item or udon) are hit-or-miss, but more of a miss. Green tea ice cream is a nice touch. If you get hot sake here, note that they microwave the sake, and it doesn't taste quite right.   Service: As others have said, service can be fairly slow and inattentive. If you order large-scale items in-house, such as the sushi-sashimi boat, they're much faster and nicer to you (this is what I usually do).  Ambiance: Great decor, but very typical \"Japanese\" style, with wood everywhere. Lighting is really good, and there are a few more private seating areas near the bar that are better for small gatherings.   Tip: You can get your mall parking garage ticket validated here so that you can park for free."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant in Toronto. Here's a few stories:  1) A group of us were having dinner before a movie when a friend of mine forgot to add a tip. When we were walking out, one of the waitresses stopped us and asked if anything was wrong. We said no. She said \"well why didn't you leave a tip?\". We all said we had... then she brought out the copy of my friend's receipt and told us off for lying. I looked at her and asked \"so do you want a tip?\". She replied that she did. So I gave her $4 on behalf of my friend. Then she took it and threw it into a tip jar without a Thank You or smile or anything - and just walked away.   2) My brother left his wallet on the table for literally 3mins, when he came back it was gone... and the waiter said he hadn't seen it.   3) I left my Ralph Lauren vest on a seat at the table. I realized I had left my vest when I had gotten into my car, so I rushed back to retrieve it. It had disappeared and the waiters acted like they hadn't seen it.   Overall= Thieves."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty decent size. However, the food is average/decent for the prices. I ordered a combo that included salmon sushi and California rolls. The California rolls were fresh but the salmon, unfortunately, was not. They failed to remove all the skin from the salmon as well. We were handed the bill by the waitress but she never came back so my party of 12 all had to walk up to the front to pay."}
{"text":"It is not a Japanese Restaurant!! Korean chef and staff with Korean Japanese restaurant!! Do not open Japanese Restaurant if you are Korean and you don't know how to cook Japanese food!!! Very dissapointed with food and service as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and very good portions.   I originally got here, because I was looking for sushi at 11pm for some reason, and the served well even though we were last call.   After that I came back with my girlfriend, and we had nice sushi date. The portions were great and delicious. Very clean and feels humble.   The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5, is because it's very pricey. But the quality of food is worth it!"}
{"text":"We came here without checking Yelp and was fortunate not to check before coming. Food was good and price is reasonable, they had table so we sat with no waiting time. Nice staff and pleasant vibe, will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good - convenient location, great sashimi, their dinner for 2 menu and sashimi/sushi boat are great.  Bad - slow service. Bad Kalbi. Huge line up during the lunch time. If you try to get a take out, it takes forever."}
{"text":"I came to know this restaurant at this location through Groupon.  The restaurant is large and spacious.  Once we sit down, the waitress comes to ask for our drinks.  We have not decided what to order, so the waitress comes and go a couple of times.  Finally we decided our orders and show our Groupon.    The miso soup is average.  We order a lobster maki roll which may not be found in other Japanese restaurants.  It tastes very good though a bit expensive.  The food is unlike these days with lots of buffet style Japanese restaurants, every dish is well prepared. The sushi and sashimi are thick slice and very fresh.  The tempura is well fried not with lots of dough.  This is definitely not a cheap Japanese restaurant.  I can say it is going for higher end and try to distinguish itself from other less expensive all you can get Japanese restaurants.  If you are in uptown nearby, give it a try."}
{"text":"Food is good overall. Overshadowed by maybe the most disrespectful hostess we've come across. She may be the owner... who knows.  Rolled her eyes several times when we told her we preferred to stand while waiting for takeout.  Rude and obnoxious!"}
{"text":"convenient location , inside the emptess walk plaza, downstair from the movie theatre. the food is average and service is okay but i find it expensive compared to the quality of the food. but i understand it is due to the location. but i'd go to other sushi place just a steeet away at sheppard where u have more choice: kiyomizu, ichiban springgarde , sakura, sushi moto, and sushi one. the price is cheaper w better quality bc of the competition"}
{"text":"I have visited Ichiban on 2 occasions, both times I got my sushi to go so I cannot comment on the servers. Both times that I have visited Ichiban I was greeted promptly and had my order taken care of right away. The first time I got food from here I got the Dynamite roll and the spicy salmon, both were very fresh and very delicious. Yesterday I picked up some sushi to go. At the front they have sushi already packed to go and since i was in a rush I decided to try it. I got the crab salad roll with spicy tempura bits, it was spicy and I loved it...finally sushi that has some kick to it! I also got the salmon roll and regular crab salad roll, all very fresh and delicious. The prices were very reasonable as well, $5.99 for the spicy crab and the other two rolls were $4.99 each. I will definitely be going back there for more sushi."}
{"text":"This is officially my new favorite sushi place in the area. The staff is the most friendly group of Koreans who are all adorable and sweet. While the dinner items on the list are pricey, their fancy rolls are quite large and have tons of meat and little rice - definitely worth it! If you come for lunch time, their bento boxes are a sweet deal. For $10 you get a ridiculous amount of food including sashimi and sushi. I also want to mention that their fish is very fresh, and they also brought me a free grilled salmon appetizer. I will definitely come back again and again whenever I have a sushi craving.  Also, if you purchase their items for take-out and pay in cash, you get 10% off :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner. There were two tables occupied. A little quiet for Friday night. This Ichiban is nicely decorated, clean and spacious. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. We ordered a combination best choice platter. It was nicely presented and fish selection was a bit better than standard.  Compared to other Ichiban, this one is much more comfortable. Prices are slightly higher by a buck or two.  We had an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"Last time I am coming here. Disappointed in the presentation of the chirashi, it came in a white cafeteria plate. The ingredients were loosely scattered on top of the sushi rice. The waitress initially said no soup or salad but brought it out after. How are u going to mix the items on a white plate? Not impressed, not coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible sushi and service. I happen to pick up sushi at this place on my go. I can squeeze out tones of oils from sushi!!!! The fish was bad already! I show them to the cashier! She denied! I guess i have to do something so decided to post!!!! Please stay away from this place if u dont wanna get sick! If the seller can't eat it themselves, why would they sell it to others! Dishonest business!!!! Please avoid this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place to go for sushi in the Yonge and St. Clair area. Love the decor. They have good lunch specials as well. Haven't ordered from their regular menu, but I'm sure it is always good."}
{"text":"Where can one go for jazzy sushi? What is jazzy sushi? Quite simply, it's sushi with swanky jazz played in the background and the place is Ichiban Sushi.   My friend and I ordered the sushi and sashimi plate, a sunshine roll, a spicy salmon roll and upped the amount of miso soup and salad so we both could enjoy. I came in anticipating ordering a bento box but they were quite expensive given offers I've seen elsewhere. The presentation was beautiful. Fish has never looked so pristine and rolls have never looked so magnificent. I was thoroughly impressed by the maki, very fresh and a good size. The sunshine roll was inventive with pink tempura bits and salmon on top but the sauce on top was too mayonnaise-y and it was virtually impossible getting the entire thing in my mouth at one. And I know you're not supposed to bite!   Don't shoot me for not knowing the specific white fish on the sushi and sashimi plate but whatever it was, it was still frozen. It was sad, I know we're in Toronto but just let me live under the guise that everything is fresh and caught from Lake Ontario down south.   Up in St. Clair area, the venue is very nice. I came here during really random hours (think: 3pm on a Sunday) and people were still eating and enjoying their meals. I like that it's the kind of place you don't have run out of. I actually spent a while just sitting and chatting after the bill had came and unless they are all very good actors they seemed happy with our presence. In short, a good, comfortable spot to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this restaurant regularly whenever we get a craving for sushi.  It has nice, clean interior, good service, and pretty decent sushi.  I would say the quality of the food is better than any average sushi restaurants in the area especially the all you can eat restaurants.  I usually get the sushi combo ($15 for 8 pieces of assorted sushi and 6 pieces of dynamite roll) or special maki combo ($16 for 9 pieces of dynamite, 6 pieces of spicy salmon, 6 pcs California roll).  My husband usually goes for the dinner special  bento box where you can choose two items of your choice.  My favorite dessert is red apple sorbet.  The sorbet is contained in a real apple (halved and carved out). So refreshing...."}
{"text":"Not a sushi guy - went there for the OYSTERS... $1 Oyster on fridays... I am sold.  Nice presentation and prompt service. Ate 30 Oysters with side order of Vegetarian rolls, some sake and plum wine for the gf. Oysters were fresh and really delicious - had a wonderful time.  Prices are reasonable - 30 Oysters with sake, a beer, plum wine and the vegetable rolls came to around $60. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Not THE best sushi I've had, but certainly one of the best ones in North York.  I've been there maybe a dozen times, and only once, has there been a problem, which was rectified by the wait staff pretty quickly.  Lunches are inexpensive and generous, tea is good too.  For dinner, it's still well-priced, and their boats offer an interesting selection.  Decor is also not bad.  Very convenient in the winter if you live in one of the condos that connect to North York Center underground or come by subway, and want to go for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"We came by here for dinner on a Saturday since we were waiting to catch the 10:00PM showing of the Dark Knight Rises, and Ichiban was right downstairs.   We were seated quickly, as the place wasn't packed, but busy. The table/seats were rather small and  uncomfortable, I had no where to put my bag. Service was fairly quick - this place is Korean-run so they had those service buttons that authentic Japanese restaurants may not have.   I ordered the Chirashi (around $15) and my friend ordered the chicken terriyaki and salmon bento box. His dish arrived way earlier than mine, and there was a piece of sushi missing from his Bento box. We advised the waitress and she apologized and said \"I didn't eat it!\" .. and brought back two more pieces of sushi for him. The amount of rice in the Bento box is less than a fistful - the portions were very small. My chirashi looked really nice when it finally arrived. The rice was a good portion, but the only sashimi that seemed fresh and not defrosted was the salmon. The tuna was very rough and I felt like I was chewing beef tendons. The rice is very vinegary and went well with the salmon. Overall, our meal was really meh.   I wouldn't return to Ichiban, as there's obviously better places to go where the price and quality are more reasonable."}
{"text":"Bad service.  They got our order wrong and when we asked to fix it, the sushi chief sounded annoyed and was saying something in his language. Another customer came up to US and translated that that the chief was saying that if we annoy him anymore he will kill us or spit in our food. Never never eat there."}
{"text":"I love this place,the sashimi is so fresh.me and my friends were really impressed.this Ichiban is even better then some other pricy ones in north York and richmondhill.so glad I find this place??"}
{"text":"The services sucks on so many levels. It wasn't even busy! Maybe 6 or 7 table seAted and there were 3 servers. We asked for beer, it didn't come. They didn't serve us tea at all to begin with. Did not service us share plates or soil sauce tray for our sushi boat. We had to ask for our beer 20 after ordering. We ordered sushi pizza and specifically asked for no spicy mayo. And after 30 min, pizza came with spicy mayo. Then we asked to change it, then it came with sushi pizza with no sauce! Not even uni sauce, but what was on it was two piece of HAIR!!!! The owner lady didn't even apologize! My moms soup came first, we ordered a sushi boat, which came 40 min after my moms udon soup. We had to ask for our bill 3 times. The owner lady was not even apologetic about our service, and made a stink that we didn't leave them tips. I do not believe I should leave any tips for services like this. I felt stressed for eating at this place !"}
{"text":"If I could, I would not give any stars. Worst service I have ever had. This is not the first time that I have had horrible service here. They never check up on your table, and it takes over 30 minutes to get your meal if they bother bringing it to you. We waited over an hour for our dish and in the end we ended up cancelling it. When we went to pay, they had not taken the dish off the bill, nor did they provide or offer any compensation. When we asked if anything was going to be done she looked at us like we were speaking another language and smirked. Then she had the nerve to ask us why we tipped so little. This is my third bad experience here in a row. I will never go back. I used to come here all the time."}
{"text":"Amazing services! Got a booth seats right away. Sushi was amazing. My boyfriend and I ordered the small boat and it was delicious. Coming back here again"}
{"text":"The no-seafood sushi eater strikes again! But first things first...  The atmosphere is lovely - very clean, very open, and just the right amount of quiet. Every time I've gone, it hasn't been too busy (I don't know why), but perfect for chatting with friends (check), first date (check...), or a 'work' dinner (check)!  The service was average, very friendly but not the most attentive. Our server disappeared towards the end of the meal, leaving us to flag for the check BUT the food & tea was brought quickly. Take the good with the bad...  The food - really delicious. For those who don't like seafood (I know, not many of you would frequent a sushi joint), the chicken teriyaki rolls are AMAZING. The avocado/cucumber maki roll are tasty (and a good price), and the golden chicken rolls (deep fried), also very good.  Lots of options for a picky eater like me! Four enthusiastic thumbs up  Oh, and fairly extensive menu & average prices!"}
{"text":"I've gone here so much, they know my family.  The food is always consistent which is all I ask.  The sashimi is fresh.  All the items are reasonably priced.  We usually get the small or medium boat and it's always good.  Sometimes we order short ribs and bagogi as well and always tasty if you want some hot food.  Of course we always down a bottle of sake when we are there."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade) I've visited this place twice, and both times I ordered their HaeDuBap (Sashimi Salad, trust, it tastes much better than it sounds). It was DIVINE. It left me full but light, the fish morsels were all the perfect consistency and taste. Everything was so harmonized in that dish!  Ambiance 3/5 (15% of final grade) The establishment itself was decorated nicely and felt clean. I'm not sure what it looks like at night, but when I went there during lunch time it was more or less like any other sushi joint, except cleaner feeling.  Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) The service was the norm. Nothing to comment about here!  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) The price range was also at par for the quality and the industry of the food offered.   Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade) Although the experience was nice, they didn't do much for me to say that it was nice. I found a piece of hair in my white rice (I'm not the type to mind too too much), and I informed them about it. I didn't request for a new bowl, since I was already finished when I found the rice, but the waitress kept offering, which was nice. When I declined, it would have been nice if they could have offered me a discount though.. They didn't, so no brownie points.  Final Grade = 56.5/100 = 3 Stars  TLDR: Food was nice, and I would look forward to visiting if I ever forget my lunch again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Japanese  restaurants in Toronto. I find that the sashimi is always fresh, and the prices are reasonable. The portions are pretty decent as well. I have never been disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on here for Groupon users,  I was a little worried so I showed my Groupon at the end of our meal. But for evening dining, my group of three had a great time.  The decor was lovely as my table was placed along a long seat shelf with pillows and liquor bottles.  The waitress immediately ordered our drinks as she handed our menus and was very polite and patient as we took the longest time discussing on what to order.  We ordered one: small sashimi boat (had a variety of fish, all fresh with excellent portion sizes), shrimp tempura entree (light, crispy, delicious, and the tempura sliced pepper was surprisingly good), miso soup and salad (came with tempura, both good), lobster fantasy roll & catepillar roll (both good), and beef yaki soba (deliciously savoury with convenient bite sized veg and meat).  I would definitely come back again if not for the great service, then for the great food."}
{"text":"First, we walked into this restaurant at around 11:20 on a weekday, the sign says they open at 11 am, but after waiting around for a a few minutes, a woman finally greeted us at the door and told us that they open at 11:30 and we would have to wait till then. We said it was fine, so we sat down at a table and waiting till 11:30 before she came around with tea and menus.   We ordered a sushi bento box and a sashimi bento box, we've been to this restaurant before and had ordered the same things so we were expecting portions around the same size.   When the bento boxes arrived, I noticed that the sashimi portions were significantly smaller than my previous visit, there were less pieces and less variety. But the fish was fresh. On the other hand, the rice was cold and hard from the california rolls and the sushi. It was no doubt old rice, probably leftover rice from last night, seeing as they opened half an hour late. After the meal, as we were paying, we informed the server about the rice, she had nothing to say. She did not even apologize for it.   Definitely not going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is really expensive for the quality and portions they give. I had the sushi and sashimi boat and it cost almost an arm and leg for it. You think with the expensive price they would give a lot...NOPE!   Service was alright, atmosphere was OK, but what will keep me from coming back here is the sub-par food, the lack of decent portions and the whack prices."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, reasonably priced, good portions & the food is always good, love the sashimi"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and waited more than 30 mins.  They cancelled my order saying I am too far but I was literally 5 mins away and they were okay with it initially.  I guess my order was too little (a little over $20) so they refused to fulfill it.  Even thou the min order was $15.  Terrible service and will never order from here again"}
{"text":"Quick service and is usually packed.   The sushi place offers GINORMOUS rolls. I usually order one plate and its good for me. My favourite are any sushi with crispy fried bits on it!   The noodle soup was okay and would not try it again. I'll stick to the amazing sushi and the free sides they give - which they did not hesitate to refill when I asked because the potatoes are to die for.   They service is great the staff is friendly and I just adore the ladies that work there as they are so polite and cute (for lack of better words).   Happy to pop in whenever I can for a quick lunch time run. The sushi tastes great but not something I rave about. I come back for the other reasons above."}
{"text":"I've come here on many occasions and was blessed to be attended to with ease and with smiles. Although the reason for my minus 1 star is because sometimes they don't always have the red bean ice cream that I solely desire from time to time - which is pretty good if you have yet to even grasp your hands onto a spoonful of red bean ice cream. But anyhow, I do wish they did have AYCE but the presentation and the food is always good. I always order the Las Vegas roll and love it every time! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  We ordered an 18 piece sashimi dinner and a dynamite roll for the two of us as we weren't super hungry. However, every single Japanese / sushi restaurant I've ever been to - ALWAYS - gives a salad and miso soup to start and they only brought out one set which I thought was strange. So I asked for an additional one so we didnt have to share a soup and salad that was smaller than the size of my fist.  When we got the bill, we saw they charged $1.99 for an extra miso soup and $2.99 for an extra salad!!! I bring that up with the server that if the USUAL complimentary soup and salad were extra charges then they should have mentioned that when we asked for it before bringing it out.   Then he continued to argue with me saying at first that ALL Japanese restaurants charge for extra miso soup and salad. Then two seconds later, he says \"well every restaurant has different policy\".  Which is it!??!  Either way, they could care less to appease an upset customer by taking off a charge that in reality wasn't much (but upset me because of the principle behind it and the way they chose to deal with the billing inquiry).   -- I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Much better sushi places in the area for MUCH cheaper and better customer service (ie. sushi bong)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. And the service was awesome. We have definitely found our new go-to sushi place. The sashimi is thick and fresh and the rolls were delicious.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Reasons for 4 star rating. Free parking. Lunch special. $2.00 oysters. $4.95 for 2 pc uni sashimi or sushi. The waitress let us take the massive (kinda private) booth even though it was just two of us. Roll was not put together well. Sashimi was fine, but not the best I've had for that price point.   Food:  Oysters - $2.00 a piece. First round came with a lime wedge and this \"sweet and spicy\" red sauce on the side. Second round came with lemon slices. She asked if we wanted more red sauce, we didn't and asked for a couple more lemon slices.   The sizes of the oysters were good. A little bigger than I'm used to, but it didn't bother me. I guess plump would be the word for them. The flavour was a little sweet, but mostly briny.   We asked what kind of oysters they were, through her accent I was able to catch ... something \"cove\". Not my favourite oysters, but for that price I would come back to try this again. I'll ask them for the name again when I do.  Uni sushi - Just under $5.00 for two pieces of uni sashimi or uni sushi. We went for the sushi. For this price, it did not disappoint! Comparable to Gal's sushi uni quality. For this price, I will order it again. The sushi was the right ratio for me.  Sashimi bento box (lunch) - $13? Ish? Came with 13 pc assorted sashimi, miso soup, salad, two piece deep fried tofu, two piece futomaki and white rice.   The deep fried pieces in the box didn't seem freshly deep fried, but they didn't seem old at all either. I liked the tofu more than the sweet potato fotomaki.  The miso soup was good. The salad was better. I always enjoy that carrot, orange, ginger dressing.   The rice was white. Don't think there were any substitutes available.   Sashimi tasted good, but I felt it could have been cut a little more uniform. For assorted they also gave more salmon than anything else. The other pieces were butterfish, snapper and red tuna.   Golden tiger roll - The roll was just okay. It fell apart easily. For that price point ($15), I've had much better. I felt like it was missing some kind of different texture... maybe... either cucumber, tempura bits or eggs could have saved this.  Complementary tea in western mugs. This was nice because this means I can drink my tea without burning my hands since it had a handle.   Complementary jap chae (sweet potato noodles). These were a nice added side to our meal. Much appreciated.  Service:  Waitress was really nice and she did her best to answer any of our questions. I wish I could have had one more tea refill though.   Final thoughts:  For a small sushi restaurant, I may be back for specific items. I would likely pass on any rolls. Will be back for the uni and oysters... I don't think I would come back for dinner, but would be willing to try something else for lunch."}
{"text":"after my last two trips to my former favourite sushi restaurant in the area, i've confirmed that i need a new spot. two replacement orders \"on the house\" just doesn't cut it when the fish is still slimy and greyish. decor is still nice though. maybe just stick to drinks or non-fish items?"}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant was so good! Our server Joe was very entertaining. He gave us a few magic tricks. The food was great especially the torched aburi tuna. $5 /5pieces of aburi was pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"I'm typically pretty understanding and patient at restaurants because I once was a server and I know how challenging it can be at times. However, I need to write this review because the customer service was just so bad. While their food is alright (although over-priced), the dining experience was mediocre at best from the moment we sat down. It first started with being given fewer menus at our table (only a table of 3), so my husband and I shared one. Not a big deal. Then after 10 to 15 minutes with no one so much as checking in on us, I went to the front desk to see if they forgot about us. I noticed the guests seated right before us had already been given water, so I knew we should have already been seen by now.  I mentioned to the hostess/server that we had been waiting awhile and were ready to order. She looked annoyed and said she'd be there. Usually, at that point, employees apologize (at least that was what I was trained to do as a server and how other establishments work) for the wait; not act like their customers are being an inconvenience. We also weren't given any side plates or anything that Japanese restaurants give customers. Not sure if tea is complimentary, but we weren't offered that either. When we were ordering, the hostess/server was getting impatient and left without even asking what we wanted to drink. The meals came out in 10 to 15 minute increments, so we couldn't start our meals together. My husband got his meal first and felt bad starting before my mother and I, so he patiently waited. But, even he was getting frustrated with the service. The hostess/server did not acknowledge at all how poor the service was; you felt as a customer like they simply didn't give a shit about giving decent service. While I'm usually a good tipper, I gave them a $1 tip, which was pretty generous in this situation. After paying, the hostess/server ran after me saying I am supposed to give at least %10. I told her I don't give decent tips for horrible service. She wanted to know my reasons why I thought that, so I told her.  Before I could say we would never return, she shooshed me with her hand, walked away, and said never mind. This place has a lot of nerve. Please don't spend your hard earned money on this place. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Just had the displeasure of eating at this restaurant. Living so close, I thought I'd give this place a try, unfortunately the food was a big miss and the price insulting.   I ordered the kalbi and tempura combo, it was truly disappointing. The meat was poorly cooked, and the portion size laughable, it was atop a mound of bean sprouts making this dish look larger than it was. If you know what LA kalbi is, you will know that 5 measly pieces of bone left at the end of the meal is hardly worth the whopping price tag of $18.99.  He ordered the chicken dolsot bibim bap. It is hardly possible to go wrong with such a staple dish, right? Wrong. The chicken in this dish was cubed white meat with no seasoning and utterly flavorless. Luckily, they offered the spicy Korean red pepper paste that usually comes with this dish and even then, it did not mask the sub par flavor. If you ordered a Wendy's chicken salad you'd get a hardier portion of protein and for half the cost.   To add insult to injury, there were no sides accompanying any of the Korean dishes ordered. And the service unsurprisingly poor.   I would stay clear of this place. If you care about quality there are much better alternatives in the area.  \"Ichiban\" I think not."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for a quick bite before a movie. He ordered the beef bimbimbap and I ordered the seafood soondubu. Shortly after ordering received side salad and miso soup no Korean side dishes. Secondly he received his order before mine. Waitress brought out my food but didn't acknowledged what I ordered. To shorten the story my soondubu was so awful had food poisoning the next day. It tasted bland and barely any seafood also skipping on Korean side dishes. This place is cheap in quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their food a lot, they had good quality sushi at a reasonable price. I got the vegetable udon that filled most of me up and we also ordered some veggie rolls. I enjoyed all of them except for shiitake mushroom... the only thing I would say they can improve on is their service. The food took a bit of time to arrive, and I personally don't like it when I have to ask the waitresses/waiters for water when our cups have been empty for a while (not because I'm spoiled but I'm shy lol). It just shows me how much they check up on their tables..."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice, and have had an enjoyable experience both times. I ordered a bento box, which comes with a miso soup and a wakame salad to begin with.  Usually I am not a fan of seaweed, but this was out of this world.  The bento box came with beef, which was done perfectly, three pieces of average sushi, three pieces of california rolls, tempura, and rice.  A bit expensive for $22.  For dessert I ordered a green tea ice cream which was nicely presented.  Overall this restaurant is great, but I find everything on the expensive side - I guess it's because of the area.  I remember on a previous occasion, the rolls were out of this world.  The bento box was good, but nothing exceptional.  They had a groupon of some sort a while back, and wish they would have another one.  I'd come back, but really can't afford to all that often."}
{"text":"Terrible service, unprofessional staff, below par sushi. There are better sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"I was searching for a go-to sushi place in north York so I thought...why not try this place? Menu was pretty exhaustive and lots to choose from and lots of space in the restaurant it seems. Sashimi was okay and Service was on the slower side. My experience was a bit disappointing compared to other ichiban restaurants. I Wouldn't come back here...so my search continues.   Atmosphere - 3/5 - It's inside the empress walk building so free parking included (yay!). After we parked we couldn't find the restaurant...and walked pass the front doors of this place a few times because they don't have an Ichiban sign on the front! There's lots of tables inside and it's a bit idly shaped as it's sort of like a L shaped restaurant with a wing closed off (think this used to be their grilled tapanyaki section) and looked like it was used for storage.   Taste - 3/5 - there was two of us so me and my friend ordered a mixed sushi/sashimi platter and the volcano roll. The sashimi is not that fresh and there was not much taste to the volcano roll.  Price - 4/5 - in comparison with the other sushi places in this area this place is fairly priced.   Service - 3/5 - this is a mom and pop run restaurant but they don't seem to have enough staff to tend to all of their customers needs and attention. Pretty typical Asian restaurant etiquette seems to be required here in order to get the waitress' attention to ask for water."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this sushi restaurant.  Its my go to place, I come here every week for their lunch special! Maki roll set is the way to go! Comes with salad and soup. The rolls are perfect, made with such care! The quality, quantity, and taste is perfection! Check out my photos as proof of their dedication! Love it!"}
{"text":"Great place, HUGE roll pieces and great cuts!  I've been to a lot of sushi places (AYCE and non AYCE) but this is one of the best places I've been to. We got the A7 combo which had a rainbow roll, a California roll, various great cuts of sashimi and various sushi. (45)  The sushi was had great proportion of rice to fish unlike many other places and the rolls I thought were already pretty big (it gets better) and the sashimi cuts were superb! We got cuts of salmon, red and white tuna (parts of which were at least 4cm thick) butterfish and some red snapper, all of which were fresh.  I'm a big man so I wasn't super full after the plater so I decided to get an extra black dragon roll (14).....which initially scared me because it was humongous. Not only did it have several tempura shrimp and probably an entire avocado inside, they also put it some stuffed crab.   BONUS: because they are Korean operated, they even gave us starter dishes which made the wait for our food seem not that bad."}
{"text":"Ohaiyo Gozaimas!  Irasshaimase! Again..  Sadly this is no longer the Ichiban Sushi House that I recommend to folks when they're in this part of town.  Sad, as this was one of my favourite mid-end range place for sushi.  The staff just didn't seem like they cared.    After a sip of our Miso that tasted like a salt lick, we told the server, and he said, \"oh\" then went away.  The seafood Udon my friend had barely had anything in it.. One mussel, one shrimp, one piece of what we think was squid.  My sushi/sashimi platter was nothing to write home about.. most of the pieces were still frozen in the middle.  *sigh*  That's really too bad.  Ichiban?  More like Make-inu."}
{"text":"Amazing service. They make you feel so welcome here!! I ordered take-out and they gave me tea while I was waiting.  Ordered the Toronto roll (crabmeat, spicy salmon, yam tempura, avocado I think) and Unagi Maki roll (bbq eel). Both rolls together were a little over $20. The rolls were yummy yummy. They definitely don't skimp on the filling! The layer of rice on the outside of the roll is thin, and the sesame seeds add a nice chew."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for this place and was not impressed.   It's a good looking place that in my opinion has overpriced sushi without an excuse. That being it's not any fresher than other places, the service is no where close to acceptable and sashimi pieces are fairly small.   Won't return"}
{"text":"Ichiban Sushi House is located inside the Empress Walk complex in North York.   It is your standard sushi restaurant. We ordered the Kalbi (not the short rib variety but the full-sized ribs) and the sashimi dinner.  Our meals came with complimentary miso soup (too salty IMHO) and salad. The sashimi was served on a bed of rice. It was very fresh. It came with ahi tuna, white tuna, salmon and some other variety of sashimi.   The Kalbi was a huge disappoinent as it was too chewy. The fat around the bones was inedible because it was too gelatinous.  To finish off complimentary green tea ice cream was served. The serving size is about 1 tablespoon... You'd think that green tea ice cream was becoming unsustainable or so something with their Scrooge-like offering. Bah humbug!  The service was rather slow.  There are better places to go for a good sushi experience. I would pass on Ichiban Fish House."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the average \"lunch special\" I ordered an eel and tempura lunch combo and came up to be 12.99. Which is fine. But then with that price I expect more than just 3 slice of eel on rice as a side dish in my take out box.  And really the price is definitely not lunch special price but rather dinner price. I really don't like this restaurant. Been there three times and I will never go back after this.  Definitely would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I came with a friend who recommended this place. I went even though it had 2 stars on yelp.  The place is wooden themed, clean and modern. Washrooms are just as clean and modern. Service was quick even though the place was packed. Free WiFi (password is their phone number).  I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki lunch box (lunch boxes are available from 11am-3pm) which came with meso soup, few maki rolls, rice, salad, and few pieces of fruits (check the photo below) teriyaki chicken tasted A-OK. My friend ordered Cali maki rolls and she let me try them, they were alright but I was expecting more of them considering the price. Tea is complimentary and they got free refills.  Overall you are probably better off going to an AYCE place. Nevertheless if you are in the area and thinking of giving this place a try then I don't see why you shouldn't. I recommend that you stick to lunch boxes though."}
{"text":"Great location with many other Japanese restaurants in the same area so you would think they would want to stand out. The staff here are not very friendly and unlike the last review, I found the place outdated and washrooms not very clean. I ordered a meal that came with soup and salad as take out and had to ask for my soup to be included and when I got home, realized salad wasn't included. Not recommended at all when there are nicer places nearby who appear to care about their business and patrons."}
{"text":"As far as Japanese culinary mimicry goes, this one isn't bad. Had a standard vege bento. Salad, tofu teriyaki, vegetable tempura, cucumber sushi... all for less than $8? Solely based on appearance, the sashimi didn't look that bad either.  Thankfully, they don't charge for the miso soup. Service was a bit slow that day but that was probably due to the mid-workday lunch rush."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times. 3 times fo Ayce. Worst Ayce ever the food comes in a bad quality, arrived late, etc. And its pretty pricy. Overall Terrible"}
{"text":"We came here with friends for a quick, late night sushi fix. I was kind of surprised by the inflated prices and was not impressed off the bat. Service was friendly and quick, considering we were one of 2 tables. We got our meals and for the price, they were definitely pretty. The meals were filling and looked great, and also tasted nice and fresh. I was quite impressed.  My only issue is that I've had the same experience and quality of food for about $5 cheaper!  Overall, it's nothing very special. It's definitely GOOD, BUT there are places within walking distance that'll do the same for much less! I think it's because it's in empress walk that they decided to inflate prices."}
{"text":"Figures the yentas in the area would love this place. Not really good at all and expensive. $13 for a spicy tuna roll!!?? Caters to the thornhill woods crowd, enjoy. I actually drove from Bathurst and Elgin mills to this place, big mistake considering I have Mi-ne 2 minutes from my house. The sashimi was super thin and tasted as if it was just defrosted. What else is there to say? If you can't cut me a nice piece of sashimi, please don't call yourself a sushi restaurant. Out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi joints! I am a huge sushi fanatic and I've recently been really inclined to stick with a la carte sushi restaurants as the quality is exponentially better than AYCE in my opinion. The sushi here is amazing.   I always get the maki dinner combos or their volcano roll platter. The place is Korean-run and I always notice that Korean-style sushi is different than Japanese. Specifically their sushi is creamier and it melts in your mouth.   Prices are reasonable in my opinion. Quantities are pretty big. I would usually share the combos I get with one other person.   The service is very nice! Servers have a slight accent but nothing majorly hard to comprehend. All staff are very friendly and always smiley. I love how I always get a warm greeting and from all the staff including all the chefs when I come in to pick up takeout.   Overall you won't get an AYCE level quantity but if you're like me and you enjoy quality over quantity and you love korean-style sushi, I would definitely recommend this place!   OH! You also get 10% off if you order takeout and pay in cash which is nice!"}
{"text":"They offer both sushi and some korean dishes here (korean owned restaurant). I think the food is okay, although higher priced and much smaller sized compared to the surrounding neighbourhood of japanese and korean restaurants. Taste is a bit bland.  We come here when we feel like eating in this plaza for the sake of watching a movie at Cineplex in the same complex.  The 2 stars are for the poor service (Update November 2016: upgraded to 3 star due to last time being quite good, the manager made sure we were making it for our movie!). I don't know how many times I had to ask for my water refill and when it did happen, the girl wasn't very nice, pouring it rudely while spilling a bit on the table.  I was left thirsty for a longgg time. Also even when they weren't full, they took a while to even look at us standing by the door. We were almost going to leave after a long few minutes until they finally brought us to empty seats.  Tip: remember to ask them to validate your parking ticket before leaving."}
{"text":"I was in the area and forgot my lunch so did take-out from Ichiban Sushi House or Kyu Sushi Bar (they seem to have two names). It's quite busy at lunch; the restaurant is quite big so there's a lot of seating. They have your usual rolls - California, Dynamite. The rolls are on average about $10 - they're full of rice so quite filling. Parking is hard to find around here (even within the Green P lot). You're better off TTCing it here.  Good for: lunch"}
{"text":"Nice quiet restaurant with good quality food and decent service. The specialty rolls are very good, nice variety of options, good value. Also we like the Yakatori Udon, nice accompaniment to our sushi meal. They also include, tea, soup & salad without charging extra  This is our go-to place for Sushi in Thornhill or you could just slop down a bunch of all-you-can-eat mystery slime for a slightly lower cost. We always see lots of people come in for take out orders. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Spicy salmon roll is actually a roll filled with a ton of Japanese bread crumbs and a tiny bit of salmon."}
{"text":"I've been visiting here a lot lately with a friend. Its always quiet, which I love. We're often given s small appetizer and sometimes a small dessert on the house. The bento box comes with shrimp/veggie tempura which is a huge plus for me unlike the sushi place in oak ridges(next to dominos) this is now my go to spot. I've been visiting here a lot and have been disappointed the last hand full of visits. They changed their Bento box and now its only a dinner special. I've placed orders with no onions and have gotten my dish with onions. Service is lacking at times. I had salmon sashimi and it was horrible in taste, fresh off the boat but not in a good way. Same with the salmon sushi. The last time I went in, the salmon tasted much better. I say this because I can taste a very faint ammonia like chemical and the salmon tastes much better. Will still go back, I really enjoy the food overall.  After visiting here last week, I won't be returning. Service has gone downhill. I had to ask for water and soy sauce with my bento box. The dinner bento is $22 and just isn't justifiable. It use to come with 4-5 pieces of assorted sushi. I always ask for just salmon sushi and they only provide me with 2 pieces yet charge me full price. Total rip off."}
{"text":"Great place and fresh sushi! The staff was super friendly and the price was fair for the quality."}
{"text":"After feeling that Ginza offered too much low scale ingredients I moved on  When i spend $15 for a Sashimi plate i expect Maguro, Yellowtail and quality items and Ichiban delivers  I had a business lunch as a guest and was pleasantly surprised at the quality offering of their plating  Too me its all about the Sushi and expect getting what i pay for  Quick service, excellent quality,and  value"}
{"text":"Overall - Quite like this place! Great for lunch takeout.  Haven't sat in yet though.  My continued sushi conquest took me to this location.  As it would happen, my new work location is littered with sushi joints.  And with several of them heavily under-performing to my expectations (maybe I've just become a sushi snob), I decided to test my luck out with this location.    From first perspective, I noticed that the restaurant had different names.  Kyu Sushi, Ichiban sushi, etc. Other reviewers have mentioned a change in management/names along with rather low rating, so I did what I could to lower my expectations accordingly.   The restaurant is very pleasing visually. Very large with several seats available.  Definitely a plus on my side.  They had a lady dedicated to take out orders (which makes sense during a busy lunch rush), and even provided a take out discount if cash was used.   I ordered myself a salmon lover lunch set which included a spicy salmon roll, 6 salmon sushi, and 6 salmon sashimi, for ~$14, and I must say it was the best sushi meal I've had among the sushi restaurants I've been to around these parts.  Their spicy salmon roll was (finally) not a slurry consisting mainly of tempura flakes (there was still a good a mount of tempura in it, but at the least it was tasty).  Their sashimi is something else, though.  Very fresh, their salmon was extremely delicious and flavourful.  I believe the fat content of the salmon they used for sashimi was higher than other places, providing a richer texture.  The quality of sashimi was so good, I came back another week to try out their sashimi dinner combo (yes dinner for lunch, I'm a baddie.) To my surprise, they included a rather expensive salmon roe to the platter! And while the menu states 18 piece plate, I counted at least 20 pieces of fish (picture attached)! Definitely the most delicious sashimi platter in these parts.   All in all, this will probably be my go to location for sushi in the Yonge/St.Clair area. the fish was really delicious and their portions were more than adequate.  For under 20 dollars for what I got, I'd say this place is a real treat.  Definitely give this place a try, regardless of what they've changed their name to!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, I guess, but service is awful. Went one day with my mom and my sister. When we told the waitress about our food allergies (gluten) instead of accommodating our allergies and, you know, doing her job, she said \"yeah, we advise that you go somewhere else\". We would have taken her up on that offer, but it was the Monday of the long weekend so all of the other sushi places we go to (sushi sushi and sushi itto, if you're looking for a great place to go to) were closed. Will not be returning. Ever. Even if it's the only sushi place open. Also didn't like how the menu was arranged. Not a lot of sets, had to order a la carte."}
{"text":"I found that their sushi did not taste as fresh as other Japanese restaurants, and fell apart far too easily. Additionally, they charged a few dollars more per item than other similar restaurants in the area. There are better choices nearby in a relatively crowded restaurant market. The restaurant also seemed understaffed and was slow to greet me at the entrance. Overall, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Walking into Ichiban I noticed right away this is not your basic cheap and cheerful sushi lunch spot. The room is big, bright and airy, and today it was not crowded at all.  The service was warm, attentive and professional too. I was already impressed. The food was well-priced, delicious and the portions were big. I ordered the Sashimi lunch special, which was $10 and said it was 12 pieces of sashimi served with house salad, soup and steamed rice.  Well, I got that and MORE! The sashimi was sliced generously, the soup was hot and flavourful and the salad was fresh. I also got 2 fried dumplings and a california roll. That was a lot of food for $10. I recommend Ichiban, for the neighborhood, and the price, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.  Located next to a Pizza Pizza, I was expecting a bit less.  But Ichiban is a nicely designed, comfortable, slightly elegant Japanese restaurant in a sea of lesser restaurants.  The lunch bento is $11.95.  I ordered the shrimp version, that was quickly delivered with perfectly cooked shrimp on a bed of vegetables with a very nice sauce.  The daily lunch specials are $10.  Today it was \"Salmon Lovers\", with a plate of different salmon rolls.  The salmon was tasty and fresh.  Ichiban is a standout.  I will be back to try other items on the menu, either by myself or with friends, or business acquaintances.  Ichiban is \"Number 1\"!"}
{"text":"If you need a sushi fix and don't feel inclined to go elsewhere, it will do in a pinch.  There are so many other places that are dramatically better, but this can just be located in the optimum spot for the moment.  Stopping in for a mid afternoon lunch, I had the sushi combo.  The fish was acceptable, but not impressive.  The presentation and assembly quality was only average.  The food is edible, but I would not be interested in bringing a business acquaintance here."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went there for dinner during the week and were really satisfied with the quality of the food. I had the spicy chicken, which was really nice (and very spicy) and the portion served was big enough for one person.  Service is quite nice but a bit slow. Would return here for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a late lunch after a doctor's appointment. I ordered the lunch combo: dynamic roll and spicy sushi roll. Because I was hungry, I ate it all and it tasted delicious, but the sushi was rolled sloppily. And too much fried stuff made for some unpleasantly tasting wasabi-soy sauce mix.  I would like to say the service was efficient and professional but unfortunately, the only server on staff was busy texting, so it took a while to settle my bill."}
{"text":"The portions and decent and taste is okay. But I feel for being in this location it's overpriced and be careful online menu prices are not updated, it's actually more expensive."}
{"text":"Fabulous spicy tuna salad and tuna tataki. Great service, too. The best part? Our waiter performed a magic trick at our table for my son. They also brought us complimentary soup and aga dash tofu.  A little pricey, but we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite so I decided to give this place a try. I did not look at any reviews beforehand, which is probably a good thing, as there were not many favourable ones on here.   I was seated right away but it did take a long time before my server came back to take my order. I started with a trio of sake and the assorted sashimi. I was really impressed with the quality and presentation of the fish. The sake was good but I'm not exactly a connoisseur so I can't say much else about it.   I followed up the sashimi with a black dragon roll and avocado salad. The roll was really good - better than I expected. And finally, the salad was light and refreshing with a side of really tasty dressing. Would likely order that again.   I found the price point of some items to be ridiculously high (some rolls were $17) and other items priced quite fair. Certainly not a spot for the budget conscious unless you eat very small amounts of food. Service was slow, especially after I was done eating. I waited almost ten minutes before flagging someone down for the bill."}
{"text":"Went here a few times with a group of four people and the service has been the exact same every time. It's very slow and you have to ask many times for your drinks (if you order).  Customer service is extremely poor, lady messed up on our order and argued with us that we were wrong.  I do not recommend going here."}
{"text":"My second visit in recent memory. Came here for early dinner, just before the somewhat busy dinner rush.   I am giving this place 3 stars considering this place does not provide freebies when you sit down and ordered.  The special rolls we order were excellent (las vegas and black dragon).  I would really appreciate if this place gave out some free apps since we did order Soju."}
{"text":"came for lunch.. Menu options were delicious. First time having buckwheat cold noodles.. soooo good. I would reccomend coming to try it out. Portions in bento box was really good. price is fair."}
{"text":"First time in the restaurant tonight and I was surprised how nice the atmosphere is.. Beautiful..!!  Service was quick and curious with tea while you wait.   I ordered a combo that came with a california roll, cucumber roll, and an avocado roll. It tasted slightly above average but priced at $12 + tax it wasn't bad.  I'm going to give it a 3 stars but I would like to try it again with some more elaborate rolls. It's tough competition in town with sushi these days."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this sushi restaurant.  The place is not usually busy, but the service is always slow.  The food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Service left a lot to be desired.  We ordered a Crunch and never got it.  We ordered Hot Water and Lemon and we needed to remind staff several times.  Food was lukewarm.  I hate giving a negative review but someone needs to realize this place needs a lot of improvement if it wants to survive : ("}
{"text":"Went here prior to watching Jersey Boys here for my friend's birthday dinner.  We were quickly seated, and ordered the sushi/sashimi boat and two miso soups.  The miso soup was surprisingly quite good.  No complaints.    The boat was quite good as well -- quite the selection of different fish.  It was just the two of us, so we were quite full in the end.  Sashimi was okay - but I felt like I could've gotten better sashimi somewhere else.  Not many maki rolls on the boat though.  *shrugs* Typical sashimi/sushi place found in the GTA."}
{"text":"Philadelphia roll was good  Maguro was delicious  Ordered oysters @ $2 a piece and they were huge.  Third sushi spot I visit in Toronto and so far better than the first two places I've been to."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food and reasonably priced. Open late and good service. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant after my afternoon appointment as it was located near the subway. After being seated in a nearly empty room (two other tables were occupied), I took a quick glance at the menu and waited patiently for the waitress to come by to take my order. Okay, I understand that she was the only one serving the room, but as I have mentioned there were only TWO other tables that were occupied at the time and the three sushi chefs looked bored out of their minds just standing behind the counter. I watched as the waitress looked busy at whatever she was doing at the front cash, she saw me looking pointedly at her and then looked away and moved out of sight.....um....hello? At this point, I was waiting 10 minutes for her to take my order. Then her coworker stopped by to chat with her for another 5 minutes. She glanced my way and then resumed her conversation with whom I assumed was another waitress who was off-duty. After waiting for 15 minutes, I was annoyed and very hungry with the other patrons munching away happily on their makis. Tried again to make eye contact, but no avail. I had then got up, gathered my belongings and left without a word. The two waitresses just stared idiotically after me as I walked out the door. Such sub par service. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Initially I thought this place was an authentic Japanese restaurant, but then after I saw the menu, I realized this place is another Korean-owned Japanese restaurant. It was Sunday noon so we've ordered from lunch menu. I ordered spicy chicken lunch box and my girl friend ordered a Udon & California roll combo.  When we were ordering, the menu said that all items for lunch comes with 4 pieces of vegetable roll, miso soup, salad, and dessert. But when my girl friend's Udon & California roll came, she did not get any vegetable roll, miso soup, and dessert. We then realized we have been scammed by them.  Also the service was horrible. The server never came to check if we wanted anything..  -2 points for scam and -1 more point for horrible service."}
{"text":"I have been here on a couple of occasions but I never found this place to anything out of the ordinary. The service and prices are average ranging from $10 to $50 depending on what you order. The most expensive item I saw was $100 for a sushi platter but I didn't pay much attention to it.  There is Korean and Japanese food available at Ichiban, which is comforting if I am not in the mood for sushi I can always get Korean. I usually get the bento box as it is usually what is most worth the price. I have tried the bulgogi before and it was just OK. Also with every meal you order comes with miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream for dessert (almost every meal).   The sushi is made fresh but I felt it wasn't as good as other places I have gone to, so I wasn't very impressed. Yesterday I went with a friend, we ordered Sushi Kame, Salmon Sushi Pizza and Pork Cutlet with Rice; the bill came up to 49$ including taxes. I would come here again once in a while but it would not be a place I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better. It is still a small little place - but it offers pretty good bang for your dollar.  The service is always pretty friendly and they are open pretty late; which is an extra bonus.  Their sushi is pretty decent and they have a pretty good variety. What I do enjoy and I find different is that they do offer an option of getting a few rolls torched; which not very many sushi places offer. My favorite is the white dragon roll, which is the butterfish on top of a dynamite roll.  For price point, I honestly find this place preferable and they offer better value in comparison to some of the other sushi places just to the north of Steeles.   The parking situation here is a cinch since there is plentiful parking here as they are attached to Centerpoint Mall."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to try this place but when I did, I really wasn't too impressed. Inside it looked nice and modern. They spent some time making the place inviting and tasteful which is nice. The place is huge but when I came in for weekday lunch, I was the only person in the restaurant.. Hmmm... I wonder why.   Lunch specials were just under $10 and you can choose either tempura, sushi, or sashimi. The Bento boxes has a lot to variety so if you like to sample many items, this would be a good choice. They have 2 shrimp and 7 vegetable tempura, and your choice of teriyaki or sashimi or sushi. It comes to be $16-21.   First off, taste the tea. Tea cup is really pretty, tea comes piping hot. And then I smell detergent on the cup and I no longer want to drink tea no more.    Miso soup came next. It was nice and hot. Perfect for a cold day. There was 2 pc of seaweed in it and no tofu. Hmm I  usually get tofu...  Then came the 9 pc tempura - came out fresh and hot. Wonderful. Tempura sauce was lighter than what I like.   Then came the fried spring roll side dish. For whatever reason, they serve a fried spring roll cold. It was pretty bland.   While eating, pop music was playing in the background. Some of the songs had inappropriate lyrics. I don't think they are catering to high school students nearby because the price point for lunch is too high.. The students are all next door at Pizza Pizza. And the music definitely doesn't suit nearby workers on lunch break.   Overall, didn't really enjoy my dining experience. If I was craving Japanese and they are the only restaurant around, then I'd be back. But since there are several other options around, I think I'll be checking out other places.   Side note: service was fast and friendly. I was in and out of the restaurant within 25 minutes."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I missed giving this place a review given how many times I have been there over the years.   This is a cozy and tidy little sushi joint. If you eat in then you will get Korean ban chan to snack on. Tonight we had takeout.  The quality here is good, not as high as nearby Aroowha, but everything is smaller than Aroowha and so more variety is possible. We still weren't able to finish everything ordered.  The Agedashi tofu and tempura were nice and crispy. The pieces on the small sushi platter were a nice smaller size and very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because I was in the area. The sushi was a little on the expensive side considering it's a chain restaurant. I ordered the Mexican Roll (chicken, green and red peppers) and the Dynamite Roll. Both were quite mediocre. Some people have mentioned the service; I found that the service was the best part of my experience here. Attentive and fast. Anyway, I'm not sure when I'll be back as there are other places to go.  Good for: lunch"}
{"text":"I came here on New Year's Eve for a last minute order of a large sushi combo platter. It came to $90. Sometime between 2pm and 10pm, we were able to eat it all between two of us.  We had sashimi, sushi and maki rolls. The fish was fresh and it was definitely a good way to spend NYE at home!"}
{"text":"Trying to find a good sushi place near my work wasn't an easy task, but I'm pleased to say Ichiban Sushi came through. The Vegetable Maki Sushi set is around $12 dollars, but that comes with 18 pieces of sushi! (6pc Avocado, 6pc Sweet Potato and 6pc Mushroom), plus miso soup and a salad. Now I realize that's a little expensive for lunch, but a ton of delicious sushi isn't anything to scoff at either.  I have had trouble ordering sometimes, so you have to be very precise and specific over the phone.  But they're really nice there and even if there is a mistake it's always corrected in no time flat.   They also had a deal where if you ordered out and paid in cash you got 10% off, which is pretty great, I'm not sure if they're still doing that though. Anyway, it's not the greatest Sushi in the city, but if you live in the area it's a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"I was around the North York Centre area and I was starving! There are limited restaurant within this mall so we decided to give this restaurant a try. There was a sign outside for $1 oyster and that was what drew me here. I ordered 6 oysters because that was the minimum order. The oysters were decent, there's no special sauce to go with it and it was on the smaller side. However, for a $1 each, I really couldn't complain. I also ordered sushi here. I can't say that I enjoyed the sushi here. It wasn't the best I've ever tasted but it's also not the worst. The pricing here was decent but because the food wasn't outstanding, I'm hesitant to come back. I rather walk a couple blocks north or south on Yonge in search for some better food."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner, and both times it was mediocre experience.  I have tried their seafood udon which was down right terrible with barely any seafood or taste. Second time around I ordered beef Don which was actually quite good, but it wasn't too authentic as beef itself bulgogy (Korean swt beef) not Japanese style.   Portions were quite small, service was quite poor as well. Both times we have been there, there were only couple tables occupied, yet it took a long to order and get our food.  It's too bad, because its only minutes away from our place.  With many other Japanese restaurants in the area, I recommend to look else where."}
{"text":"I was here after the new owners took over (April 14, 2011 I believe)  We came for the 50% off deal The food was very good  We had edamame to start and were also served complimentary miso soup  We also ordered shrimp tempura - it was ok; my piece was half hollow, which was disappointing We had a few sushi pieces (the tuna sushi and salmon rose, which was very beautiful) The majority of our order was maki My favourite was the Bay roll (with deal fried scallops) - SO tasty, they put a peanut sauce or something in there and they also use a spicy mayo VERY tasty we also had the ichi roll - it has eel and avocado on the outside and shrimp and crab and other tasty items on the inside; this was also a hit The spider roll with soft shell crab was good as well; a little too fishy tasting for my liking We also have the salmon sushi pizza and it was very good and nicely presented  The one disappointing thing is that they did not have the King Crab roll, which we were really looking forward to and also the roll with lobster in it; they said it is only seasonal Overally, great food it is a bit pricey so i suggest taking advantage of the 50% off offer (on until April 20th) - it works on everything but the lunch specials"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out because I'm tired of all you can eat places and this place seemed to offer a variety of rolls.  What we ordered:  Golden spider roll, Volcano roll, Lobster fantasy roll, Las Vegas roll  The volcano and lobster fantasy were probably my favorite ones.  The golden spider roll was alright but I found it kind of dry.  The Las Vegas roll wasn't anything too special, I think.  Please check website for roll descriptions - I'm too lazy to type them out right now.  The service was disappointing.  We had to flag down another waitress to get the waitress serving our table.  She took our order, gave us our food and that was about it.  Didn't come back to check on us, didn't refill our water, nothing.  We even had a different waitress bring our bill because the sorry-ass waitress that took our order didn't even bother to come back.  I'm not sure if I would go back here.  Perhaps if we get a different waitress.  I wish I remembered her name so that I could specifically ask not to be served by her.  The food was alright.  The lobster fantasy roll was too big to eat in one bite - that's sort of a turn off.  It got messy."}
{"text":"Silly Ichiban chain just needs to go on being more and more inconsistent.  I came to this Ichiban Sushi at Empress Walk for a snack during the down hours between lunch and dinner. Three wait staff were sitting snacking at a table near the entrance, in clear view of both the few diners present and the entrance. We were seated between the lone other occupied table and a loud private room where a large group was finishing what appeared to be a cross between a business meeting and late lunch. Not a great start.  Drink and food orders were taken and delivered, in true form, in the order they were ready. And then we were ignored until we pressed the call button- highly unnecessary for a restaurant where the wait staff has a clear view of all patrons, of which there were only three tables' worth. Staff standing in clear view of us, eating in the doorway to the kitchen could probably have been more professional and/or attentive (I guess that in this place, hoping for both might be a stretch).  The avocado salad was massive (definitely for two/entree-sized) and was brought with dressing on the side. It was rather creepy to see what the standard Japanese restaurant salad dressing looks like in that form, but hard to go wrong with lettuce leaves and sliced cucumber and ripe avocado. A specialty roll came exactly as described on the menu, no more and no less, and was fairly average. The fish was fresh, but by no means generous, and the rice could have been better. Chap chae, on the menu as an appetizer, but arriving last of the three items we ordered, was served piping hot and, while a little on the sweet side, was otherwise just right with lightly sauteed vegetables.  Food wasn't quite reasonable for the price; not sure if we left a tip or not for the quality of service. I won't be back any time soon. Free wi-fi available from the adjacent Second Cup."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. The service is warm and goes at the right pace.  Meals all seem to come with a chap chae and pancake appetizer that aren't announced on the menu. The fish, unlike at other sushi places, is served in a nice size and at the right temperature. A few staple Korean dishes on the menu are excellent.  As another reviewer mentioned, the lunch special (which has always been the same chicken teriyaki and california roll every time I've been), brings lunch in under $10 and definitely does the trick of filling you up. Food is reasonable/you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Just don't come here.... They are soooooooo slow. The food is mediocre but it took them 45 mins to make spicy salmon roll. The place wasn't even half full. Terrible."}
{"text":"I had lunch with some colleagues today.  They wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant.  I'm a fussy eater and this is one of the worst places for me to eat.  But I verified that yes, they have teriyaki chcken and rice so there was something I would eat.  Yay!  We went to Ichiban Sushi House, which is near our office.   We were served salads and miso soup as starters.  Three of my colleagues shared some plates.  They said it was delicious and were delighted with the amount of fish vs rice ratio (there was a lot of fish and not much rice).  Another colleague and I are less adventurous and ordered Chicken Teriyaki bento boxes.  All I ate from mine were the chicken and the rice, which were okay.  The service was very quick.  Our server was there to take our drink and food orders shortly after we arrived.  Mere minutes after the sushi pizzas were dropped off, our meals arrived.  If you are a lover of Japanese food, this is probably a good place for you to check out."}
{"text":"Have literally just finished my meal (lunch).  Had the sashimi and nigiri sushi combo for lunch.  Service:  If the staff smiled more and were a bit more welcoming when you arrived, it would earn them another star.  Did not look like the happiest bunch.  For that, I award them a 2.  Food:  I will admit that the fish was fresh.  No question.  HOWEVER:  this is where the budget-sushi thing is revealed.  Rice was way, way too sweet and not sticky enough, i.e. falling apart on the nigiri sushi.  Major faux-pas.  Portions reasonable, prices very reasonable, nice decor.  All around, a two and a half, three at best."}
{"text":"My sister and I were pretty hungry. I like Korean and she like sushi. We figured why not kill two birds with one stone.    We waited at the front for at least two minutes before a server sat as down. It was pretty quiet and there wasn't large groups. But we didn't mind.   We did mind by how inflated the prices were. The beef tofu stew was way over how much I would typically pay at a Korean restaurant. But I wasn't alone so I couldn't be greedy. My sister was also shocked by the prices she had to pay for sushi. Especially considering their packages didn't correspond with that she would typically have.  But we had already been seated and the server was nice. So we ordered out over priced dishes that came with a nice service. We ate, paid and left. It's safe to say the place is nice and accommodating but it's a little on the $$$ end. Not $$."}
{"text":"LOVE IT HERE! I used to come here almost twice a week for lunch when I was in high school. Best sushi I've had."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special today and had to throw it out. Only one way to describe it - gross! Salmon was not nearly sushi grade with pieces of fat and badly cut. The salad was covered in very unpleasant oil which made that not eatable.   I've given the place a few tries as its the only sushi place near work that's walkable.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Got their Spicy Salmon, Dynamite, and Rainbow rolls. They are presented nicely but they do not come with a bowl of miso soup or salad. They taste like ones you can probably get from a shopping mall sushi chain. I'm not sure if it's MSG, but something also doesn't taste very good in their rolls. I wouldn't recommend this place for their rolls."}
{"text":"I got their California Roll to go & it was decent. Better than some I've tried in other places. I haven't sat down to eat here in a while. I don't really have any incentive to eat here since there's so many other great Japanese restaurants around."}
{"text":"This place never disappoint me. You can also purchase movie tickets at a lower price when your bill is over thirty.   They provided both Japanese and Korean dishes. And we used to book their tepan dishes before."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is the name Ichiban (translation #1)  completely overused for sub-standard sushi joints?  I mean you could probably go to the far reaches of Uz-becki-becki-becki-stan-stan and there would be an Ichiban sushi there too I bet!   My mission at Ichiban is to meet up with a good friend  to catch-up on some good ole girl talk.  Getting here early may have been a mistake as I sit alone while observing/cringing at the decor fail that unfolds before my eyes. If I could assign a theme, it'd be the Arabian nights (drapey sheer curtains and dim lighting) meets the OK Corral (lotsa wood panelling).  Maybe a resto makeover is not in the cards, but if I can put a suggestion out there I'd say Ichiban needs to focus on one theme at a time.  My lovely friend arrives and we engage into a flurry of conversation as it's been a while since we've met.  At this point, we keep getting hasty service as the cute but curt Korean waitress keeps interjecting every minute between our conversation to ask in her best Engrish  \"you ready to odah\" delivered with an insincere perma-smile and if I could translate her inner conversation it would sound more like  \"can u fuckin' cut the chit chat and order already!\"  I wouldn't mind if it was busy, but the resto was pretty empty so it did become a little annoying.  My DC orders the sushi appetizer which she swears is fresh and very tasty and me being the \"banana\" I am order the Chicken Teriyaki Rolls which is grilled chicken, avocado, cucumber, red onion and lettuce wrapped, and topped with teriyaki sauce and red pepper sauce.  Wasn't to keen on it as the chicken tasted like it was day old or thawed out from the freezer, in fact the one good thing about the roll is the red peppery flavoured sauce drizzled atop it.  Save for the great time I had catching up with my friend, I'd say the food/ service at Ichiban was lacklustre.  Maybe instead of Ichiban they should change their name to Hyaku-ban (100th place) or maybe I just need to Japan-up and get the nerve to actually eat sashimi for once...hmmm...yeah, not gonna happen!"}
{"text":"Lunch combo is cheap comparing to downtown.  Sushi quality is under average, that's what we get from that price.   Service is slow because they are lack of staff.   Location is nice and convenience."}
{"text":"Haven't go there for years. Drop in today for lunch even better than before. Well money spent"}
{"text":"My go-to place for sushi uptown.  Fair prices and delicious maki.  It's a nice place for a date (very quiet and the servers will leave you alone unless you call for them), with a bunch of tables and about 4 or 5 booths.  You can also sit at the counter and watch them make the sushi, but i've noticed most people don't.  Service is always good and the waitresses are always smiling.  Definitely would recommend it.  Really the only downside is they seem to mess up the order for pickup about every other time.  Nothing major just things like getting the wrong dish, or forgetting to include something.  They always fix it but it's annoying having to drive back to get it corrected.  Really that's the only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Ordered the Love set and it looked great. The sashimi.. was flavourless. The staff were fine- waitress was quick and polite. If you come here, you're probably better off ordering a specialty roll that has sauce and the works..!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars I'm not a particularly big fan of the Ichiban chain in Toronto and can't say I've had more than a 'meh' experience on the average visit.  I lugged myself to St. Clair with some friends a little while ago and was happy to see this location stood out from the rest.   The Sashimi platter as has been mentioned before was simply excellent! I'm definitely not a big fan of Sashimi at any medium range restaurant, but I was surprised to find how fresh, and tasty the various cuts were. For once, the white tuna stood out (and as rare as it is in Toronto, it was real white tuna!), while the shrimp was not the best I have had.  Not too much stood out from the typical maki rolls and in fact the spicy rolls were definitely lacking 'the kick'. One roll I would definitely suggest though is the Green Volcano roll which comes with a dip that basically looks and tastes like guacamole! As odd as it sounds, it tastes fantastic and I would definitely order it the next time around.  Overall above average food, and very decent cuts of fresh fish for the price. Service could do a lot better but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Waiters and waitresses didn't really act in a friendly homely way felt like pulling teeth... not even suggested dishes from staff."}
{"text":"Two words: cold beer. Other than that, steer clear. Sushi and rolls were below average and really showcased that not raw fish and maki is created equal! Hamachi hand roll tasted like it was scraped up from the bottom of a dumpster. Fishy and reddish?! Hamachi is supposed to be white and melt-in-your mouth fresh. Chicago roll was dull and tasteless - like underripe avocado. Service poor."}
{"text":"The food was devoured within a few minutes. That's how good the quality was. Even though the sashimi pieces were smaller than other places, it tasted great. I got assorted sashimi, philadelphia rolls, fantastic roll (torched Salmon with asparagus) and dynamite rolls. All maki rolls were made to perfection. It was mad expensive, but definitely worth the splurge. You need to order over $45 for delivery if you order through Justeat.ca"}
{"text":"--- Food --- I didn't check Yelp before coming to dine here with a friend. If I did, I probably wouldn't have came here from its 2/5 star rating. Fortunately my friend picked this place for her birthday! :) We both ordered Chirashi sushi - an assortment of sushi on bed of rice. It was appetizing and savoury, the sushi was fresh, the rice were cooked well. Quite filling for one!  --- Atmosphere --- The interior of the restaurant is nice for dining. I would bring my date here. Service decent.   --- Summary --- I tried Chirashi at Japango as well, and I liked it at Ichiban more. Both good but I liked their assortment better. I would definitely come back for this dish again, reasonably priced around $20."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and wanted to add a review. Ichiban has a modern beautiful decor and fast, attentive service. The waiter was great, gave us a few \"on the house\" appetizers and did some impressive slight-of-hand magic tricks when presenting us the bill. The menu is full fledged Japanese with everything from tempura to teriyaki and of course, sushi. Prices are very reasonable. I've enjoyed the sushi; the hand rolls are super fresh and tasty. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Do not come here. Staff are rude and the food is subpar.  The spicy salmon roll was all tempura and literally a small hint of salmon with oil dripping in your mouth.  Disgusting. When I asked for a new roll (I never complain) they said no and too bad.  Horrible!"}
{"text":"3.5 star  Ichiban Sushi House though is like a Franchise, this location in Vaughan does stand out from others I been to....  Decoration is super chic and classy, not traditional Japanese!! Reminded me more of a Sake Bar than one of the Ichiban Sushi House I been to.  Sushi Bento Box ($10.50) - So nicely presented... I can tell the kitchen staffs really took the time to make sure even a lunch special is up to certain standard - Though it is a Sushi Bento Box, the Tempura is the star! Lightly battered, freshly deep fried, crispy on the outside, oh so moist inside.. and that goes for the veggie too!! - The fish was fresh... and I really enjoyed the sushi - They did mess up with my order for Spicy roll and I got California roll instead... which I usually don't mind, but the way they made their Cali roll here was with a touch of mayo... way too much mayo for my liking...  Services here is friendly and nice... The two Korean wait staffs make sure I have all I need and more..."}
{"text":"Just okay. All the waiters seem super busy and they even forget their smile. Comes with miso soup without any spoons but chopsticks. The waiter said nothing to me"}
{"text":"Came here on a late Thursday night and it was empty.  The waitress was very patient with us as we had a lot of questions including substitution requests and we took forever to order. The food came very quickly and it looked delicious. I ordered the sushi and sashimi dinner but asked for all salmon which was an extra $2 which is pretty standard.  My friends got the chirashi don and spicy seafood yaki udon.  We all loved our food!  The udon was very spicy (friend eats spicy food on the regular but still found it quite spicy although delicious).  The chirashi don had all the usual types of fish but it wasn't in a bowl like you'd normally get it.  It was displayed very nicely.  The quality of fish was nice and fresh.  We also got shrimp tempura which were HUGE!  The batter did not feel oily at all.  They also gave complimentary glass noodles and even chicken karage!  Would definitely come back. Bonus is it's connected to the parking lot of Centrepoint mall so there's convenient free parking!"}
{"text":"A good ol' run of the mill sushi place.  Their vegetarian maki was fine. Their tea was fine. Their edamame was fine.  One of the better places to grab lunch as far as bang for your buck is concerned if you are also avoiding your work lunchroom."}
{"text":"My friend order a party platter for his new years eve party. I went with him to pick it up and to our surprise they lady had no idea what he was talking about. My friend said I came in person and placed the order with you personally. She looked clueless. She then looked in the orders for Jan 1st and there it was!! Not done of course. She told use it would take 10 mins to make. He then decided on a smaller platter which was about half the cost. The platter took longer than 10 minutes to make and I was extremely surprised they had no veggie rolls in it. I wasn't expecting a lot but a least a few for the non fish eater. My friend was getting worried as this delay was cutting it close to the start time of his party. We managed to make it back in time to set up.   I am shocked at the fact they misplaced the order when my friend went in person earlier in the week to place it. Shows to me they are unorganized."}
{"text":"Our first time here was with a groupon and the groupon did what it's supposed to do--we've come back several times.  Best part of the menu are the huge, complex, diverse rolls, 2 will be plenty for a meal.  They aren't cheap (range in price from $8-$12) but they are full of wonderful ingredients like soft-shell crab, lobster, in addition to the usual suspects, each roll has about 10 monster bites.  They have 2 kinds of tataki (paper thin sliced rare beef or tuna) served with raw onion and a piquant sauce, a nice choice if you are counting calories.  Another delicious starter: the shitake mushrooms grilled in butter and served sizzling and earthy.  Miso soup above average in flavour,  edamame hot. A large saki came in a teapot with double the capacity of the large container one would usually get, for $20.  But we were four and went through it handily.  It would have been a bit much for two, though.  We found the service perfectly attentive, but it was a Tuesday evening with plenty of empty tables.  This place is a cut above the Bloor sushi corridor both in price and variety, and worth it.   Park behind in parking garage, or walk 2 minutes from St. Clair station."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner once and it was decent.  There wasn't anything that overally memorable.  The prices are fair and its a convienent  location right at the subway station.  There are a few places in this area that are better.  This restaurant is part of a chain, which I have been to and their other ones are better."}
{"text":"This place has always been a problem with me. Their hot meals are usually good however their sushi and sashimi is lackluster. They are usually not fresh and have very small servings. They recently opened up their all you can eat, and it was worse than the makis alone. The rice was too soft and the sushi not fresh. The hot dishes were of lesser quality and it was a disappointment. It was expensive as well. All in all, not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from them for delivery and it took over an hr after they said 45 min and the food is not that good"}
{"text":"I went to the other 2 ichiban south down the street. They both were kind of bad. That's why I have never thought about trying this one until I saw the review from yelp. This little sushi place is a bit smaller than the other 2 but it is very cozy. It has LOTS of parking spots outside, which is very convenient.   We ordered the ocean rolls(tuna, salmon, avocado, fish eggs and fried shrimp) and red dragon (the one with salmon, avocado, and fried shrimp). Yum yumm!! The fish tasted so fresh, the size was decent for the price. Around 11 bucks for the rolls.   Service was excellent and it has very comfortable seating. Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I used to come here sometime.  Today they gave me un cleaned plates (you can literally see  all grease and stuff).  Busy giving me food while I am eating.  Rice looks like at least 2 days old rice and so on...  Very disappointed, and won't be coming back again"}
