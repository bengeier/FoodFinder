{"text":"If you love oriental cuisine - this is a superstore for everything required to put your meal together. It is always busy."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Asian supermarkets I've been to. It's clean and there's take-out! T&T also includes a sushi section and a bakery section. I enjoy the free samples as well (they really work on me). They've recently renovated and the place looks great. Everything is organized and the store is nice and bright...and did I mention CLEAN?"}
{"text":"One of the first T&T's in Ontario and situated in unique location -- inside the Promenade Shopping Mall.  

When it first appeared I was sceptical. A few business had leased this location after Eatons but none of them ever survived for very long.. it had been unoccupied for some time until the mall leased T&T the lower. 

Many years later, the T&T franchise had only grown and established itself as the top Asian supermarket chain in the country. There are several T&T locations in Ontario now. Even Loblaws corporation recognized this ethnic grocery leader reach and acquired T&T July 2009 to expand into this market.

This store is well maintained and kept clean,  features: vegetable, meats, seafood, dairy, frozen food, snacks, hot foods, bakery departments.

It offers most all of the popular ingredients for a home cooked Asian cuisine. From Chinese, Filipino, Thai, Japanese, Korean cultures.

Ingredient freshness is the number 1 criteria of any supermarket I frequent. 

I have had no complaints of  anything I had bought from here over the years. 

The bakery does a pretty good job. The Portuguese tarts and fresh steam buns are some of my favorites.  All of their chinese buns and artisan breads are now made using Utane method (derived from Japan). Result is a super soft, moist bread that can kept fresh longer.  

The checkout is reasonably quick - if you're just grabbing a few things there is an express 1-5 item checkout by the customer service desk. 

Some of the things I most especially like here are:

-Crazy Specials (really some ridiculous deals to drive traffic to the store)
-Contests (who doesn't want to win an ipad  lol)
-Country Theme or Festival Celebration features throughout the year
-Organized and Clean"}
{"text":"Everybody here speaks English!
A lot of Russian, Polish, Jewish, and other non-Chinese patrons shop here, thus the high proficiency of the English language at this location.
I don't really care, but I'm sure that's a nice factor for other people. I don't like this location. It doesn't feel very comfortable to shop here. I hate the parking lot; it...doesn't feel comfortable parking here. I only found myself popping in here for a quick bottle of tea when I am in the area.
Something is off about this location; it lacks the feelings of a Chinese supermarket. It's never buzzing with people; it's too damn quiet, Hell..it's maybe even too damn clean!
The experience of shopping in a Chinese grocer is not there. 
Much of the items available for purchase is even altered to fit the needs of the ethnicity of the surrounding area. What's the point? Just open another No Frills or something. 

The cooked food area is underwhelming, which in my opinion has always been the main event of any T&T. I'm just not feeling the love.

It's like the staff here don't remember the good ol' days back on the boat."}
{"text":"Good selection, good quality and honestly, the neatest produce area I've ever seen.

The only drawback to this place is that it's quite pricier than other Asian grocery stores. 

But, I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Clean grocery store with Asian staples all around and decent prices.  Every time I come here, the Asian in me comes out and I go deal hunting.  That being said, I usually come here after 6:30pm because that's when they start to mark down their ready-made food/sushi and continue to mark down until the store closes.  My recent visit had me buying 2 sushi kits originally $8.99 down to $4.50.  My girl and I ate right then and there at the tables just outside the grocery store and it was delicious as far as fast food sushi goes.  I went in again to buy some more cheap stuff for meals for the next day and got a platter of rice with mystery meat in it which ended up being Chinese sausage slices and a few pieces of chicken for $2 and 2 more things of dim sum for $2 each as well (Tripe and dumplings).  Can't say it was that great of food but it wasn't bad and for that price, straight up awesome.  If you're cheap like me, hit up a T&T after 6:30pm and you'll score big.  Some of my friends get freaked at the amount of mystery meat there but I'll be honest, I've not had a thing there that I didn't like."}
{"text":"The five stars is for the seafood section, it's incredible.  Really clean area, no fishy smell.  Mainly because it's almost all live in these huge tanks.  Not only would I say this is the best place to buy fresh seafood in the GTA, but it's much cheaper than most seafood markets.

Once I got a six pound lobster, that was so lively, I could barely hold onto it.  Another time I got a pound of live prawns, cost me six bucks!"}
{"text":"I waited at the bubble tea line for 10 minutes while I watched the lady work, I assumed she hadn't seen me and said \"excuse me, can i get a bubble tea?\" 
she told me i could only get the ones up at the front, so i asked her if she could make me one, because usually i get something that isnt at the front.
She told me they were closed. It was 2:14pm. But apparently their open til 10pm on Tuesdays. So i asked her why they were closing at 2 and she called over another lady, who also said were closed. I politely asked her when they closed and she walked away from me. I don't think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"They have a self-serve hot bar now! And as such, their prepared foods are immeasurably better and cheaper. I wholeheartedly approve."}
{"text":"Really good prices. Surprisingly better than walmart when items are on sale. I bought a prepared sushi/roll platter and it was delicious! Will continue to shop here."}
{"text":"Decent market for Asian staples: veggies, sauces, meat. However, I wish they carried more Indonesian and Dutch-Indonesian foodstuffs (What? No muisjes? Nor spice mixes for rawon from Indofood? Boo!) On the other hand, the prices are pretty good for other basics like eggs. The bakery is also nice, too, and they carry the softest, spongiest fresh sandwich bread plus a goodly selection of moon cakes. Mmm, moon cakes."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on 03 February 2018 at around 1:55 p.m.  We have been there before as they have a Hot Food Deli that serves fresh hot food, salads, etc.  However now it is all self-serve, the prices have gone way up and the sweet sour pork ribs tasted awful.  The hot and sour soup was excellent, but  now costed $3.99, .50 cents more since the last time we were there.  They get rid of the servers, make everything self-service and increase the prices.  It was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"YAY'S!!: Mini Japanese Cheesecake $1.99, Coconut cream & almond bun $1.99. $2.99/lb boneless chicken special. Great deals on fresh
 & frozen tillapia & trout. The $6.49 2-item combo... get the lemon chicken & spicy chicken (low heat/spicyness). Updated: electronics sub-store is quite decent. I bought a great charger cable for my Android phone for $7.

 SUPER-YAYS!: The \"1-3 item express\" checkout lane -  love this! Wow - this location is lightyears ahead of the T&T I visited in Ottawa. I feel spoiled to be next to such a clean budget grocery store with such a great selection of products! The customer service has been really remarkable too... plus no language barriers whatsoever at any of the departments (unlike Ottawa). This is a great place to shop if you want some cooking inspiration! I was so tempted to buy some of the live crab, lobster & fish they had on display and go grill it up with some of the great quality herbs they offer in the produce section. Maybe get the lime leaves and pre-peeled garlic (both about $1.99 a pack) and steam some collard greens with Thai chili sauce on the side. Or grab one of those large ripe avocados and make a nice salad. The options are endless! 

NAY: $5.99 hot food express special - \"Elegant single combo meal\". Noodles with what I was told was beef. More like 'surprise me\" beef lol. Hoping I might catch better specials if I go earlier on the next weekday.

Goodbye No Frills!!"}
{"text":"CUTE! Chinese Girl describes the Promenade Mall as \"the white people mall\" despite there being a T&T. Situated on the northern end of Jewish Bathurst strip it's a little surprising to find a T&T here. Although ultimately it's welcome. There's huge amounts of parking given it's a mid-sized mall. Ever try to get near a T&T in Markham on the weekends? So not happening. 

T&T price wise is eclipsed by Foody Mart and Tone Tai. You can find Bahn Mi here but they seem to sell out Saturday and there aren't any left by Sunday. The lunch counter is actually a great deal. 4 items (plus rice and soup) for what you'd pay for a combo meal at McDiggles. Srsly. There's rarely seating in the T&T's small food court area but you're steps away from the mall's food court proper. No probs taking it out there and just mowing down.

Where to pay for the take out food is a little confusing, however. There's no cash at the take out counter. Eventually we figured out you had to just get in line at a regular cash and pay for it."}
{"text":"T&T was busy yesterday afternoon.  I was there to get a snack from my busy work schedule.  Arrived at their pastries area.  Wide selection of buns and cakes.  Looked for my favorite seaweed pork bun, and bought a couple.  The line up was a bit long.  I placed my buns on the conveyor.  The elder man in front of me was rude.  He kept pushing my buns back and back because he did not put his items on the conveyor until it's his turn.  I was in flames.  But being a classy me I kept my cool.  The man bought 220 worth of meat, compared to my 3 dollar buns.  Of course the cashier didn't say anything.  Not saying she was right but she should have told the man don't touch other people's items.  Once that man was gone I paid my products and went back to my car to devour the bun.  It was on par delicious."}
{"text":"It is a decent supermarket with below mediocre food served in the sushi area and dim sum.
The convenience is where this supermarket makes up for the adequate quality."}
{"text":"This is the first location of this chain which I had visited.  As others have noted, it is very clean, at least the part that is visible.  There is a huge variety of Chinese stuff, a smaller Philippine section in one corner, and miscellaneous Korean, Japanese and Southeast Asian goods scattered throughout.  Nice selection of live fish and seafood.

Some good buys on meat; I think one might be able to better on produce in smaller Asian markets if not buying items on special.

The store area includes a number of separate businesses (some reviewed in Yelp) which form a kind of Asian mall-within-a-mall. 

Checkers seem more considerate and polite than at some other markets."}
{"text":"Dear T & T,

you flipped my world upside-down.  You took my relatively quiet, calm, ample parking little mall of my youth and turned it into an all-out-Asia-mega-land.

Not that I'm complaining.  In fact, the day after I moved back from Tokyo I came directly here.  And oh, you saved me!  You had isles and isles of unknown foods.  I had to smell cellophane bags to try to figure out what was in them - and I felt at home.  Thank you, T & T, for bringing in a balanced amount of confusion into my grocery shopping experience.

Aside from that T&T has an incredible selection of all-foods-Asian.  My husband's Texas grannie is obsessed with bubble tea - so all I had to do was mosey on up here to stock up on a complete DIY bubble tea experience - everything down to the fat straws and drink mix!  

I also love the fact that I can pick up my favourite Japanese drinks here (calpis anyone?) as well as tofu-noodles.  They pretty much have it all here - and it's easier to navigate than China Town!"}
{"text":"This was the first T&T to open in Ontario. When it initially opened, there were hordes and hordes of people shopping here as it's the first upscale Asian supermarket (as in, without that smell normally associated with Asian supermarkets). Now that there's multiple T&Ts in the GTA, customer traffic has gone down to respectable levels.

I purchased a sushi set here for lunch, particularly the one discounted to $9.99 from $14.99, which was easily an awesome deal. The fish and rolls were quite good for supermarket quality, but there was definitely a lot of rice used in the sushi.

In addition, I'm not sure if this was a weekday only thing but there were a lot of empty cupboards in the frozen food when I went on a Monday. In particular, the fish ball counter was completely empty, and I couldn't find anywhere to purchase fish balls if I were to purchase them.

The produce section was one of the most organized of all the T&Ts in the GTA, and I find the quality to be higher than the T&T I normally go to (Unionville).

Overall this T&T is good for the community it serves, and is well connected to the Promenade Shopping Centre. For a larger variety of selections, however, Warden store would have better options."}
{"text":"I came here multiple times during a short vacation stay in the area. 4 stars for the convenience of having a large format Asian supermarket connected to a Western mall - awesome to have one stop shopping! 2.5-3 stars for the prepared food (I tried samples of the shanghai noodles and other noodle dishes - and they were tasteless. Bought a whole order of the free range chicken (would not let me buy a half order) - and it was also so-so. Better choices were the two versions of potsticker (pork and pork/vegetable), the glazed chicken wings, and bbq pork. Relatives also vouch for the dim sum choices being a better choice too (we had the chicken feet which were fine). Enjoyed their bakery as well, with the fresh bread choices (whole wheat and quinoa choices) and usual Cantonese savory style buns and tarts."}
{"text":"I really like this store.  I feel every time I am shopping here I am eating healthy.  A lot of healthy choices and selections.  I go there for the specials.  sometimes they have boxes of mangoes for really cheap.  I also go there for the fresh noodles which I use in my stir fry. I also like their mushroom selection and fresh vegetables.  Their bakery is also very nice.  I always come out of this store with a smile."}
{"text":"Organized chaos.  Prefer the other T&T locations.  Everything here seemed jumbled around all over the place.  Take out counter was busy - food looked good.  They have good BBQ for take-out - including my favorite -- suckling pig ...

But this particular store didn't do it for me - no wild salmon?  And lots of frozen fish ...

The parking lot for the Promenade is an absolute nightmare.

Not my first choice."}
{"text":"There was a sale of the BBQ pork (Char Siu/???) last week and I bought a box thinking it was the usual red/sweet BBQ pork Char Siu recipe that I have always bought at T&T supermarket. To my surprise upon buying a box and tasting it at home I realize I was tricked into buying this meat on sale. We opened the box of the BBQ pork (???) for dinner and we tasted it and noticed it tasted pretty weird. It tasted like it was marinaded in Lou Mei (??). There was a strong five spice aroma and we could not eat this for dinner because of how repulsive the taste was. This is not how Char Siu is supposed to taste and T&T supermarket knew this and decided to sell boxes of it at reduced price tricking people in thinking that this is BBQ pork Char Siu. This is totally an example of misleading sales tactics and fraudulent misrepresentation.

I was extremely disappointed that my local T&T supermarket knew about this issue, and decided to sell it reduced price instead of throwing it to the garbage even though this would be considered out of spec and should not be considered eligible for sale. 

This is the second time where I have bought BBQ pork from this location and was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. The other time I bought BBQ pork (??) from this location the box was 75% fat and was considered inedible but the chef still sold it to me when I specifically asked for a lean cut. I only discovered when it was time for dinner that I had been sold this poor quality food after noticing piece after piece was literally FAT. I literally had to drive back there in the middle of my dinner to exchange it for another box. 

And now, I am done with returning to the store to exchange my food and wasting my gas. It's not worth it. They don't have anything remotely close to quality control in their kitchen, especially when it comes to their company trying to minimize cost. I sent a complaint to their customer service department and got a BS response saying they were doing a promotion for their BBQ pork using natural ingredients/food colouring, and antibiotic free pork. Oh really, so this was not some mess up by the kitchen, but you guys intentionally were trying to sell off this crap food without being transparent and upfront to customers. Thanks for letting me know after you pocketted my money by tricking me into thinking this was char siu."}
{"text":"I saw a deal for live lobster for 11.99 per lb. Picked 2 big one. Was gonna weigh it but the guy behind the bar said to go to the cashier. I went to the cashier, and she said I should have weighed it at the live seafood bar. Then she called for help! A man came and took my lobsters to weigh. The bill came as 36.87 for 2 live lobsters. The problem was on the sticker, it said 30.84 per kg. My lobster weighed 1.18kg. So from the deal of 11.99 per lb, my bill should be maximum 27-28 dollars. It was obvious that they took advantage of me not watching them weigh and put the right price on my lobster. It was a big disappointment.

I emailed T&T customer service about the problem. Not because I wanted the $10 back, just because I think the head office should know about it. And I must say they have very good customer service. I got the refund of $11.36 back."}
{"text":"The cleaner and fresher experience compared to the Hong Tai supermarket chains and a much more elaborate selection of meat and seafood. 

Fresh white tilapia and the seafood tanks in general are kept very clean without the fishy presence of gills and fish guts lingering in your nose. Service of 'clean and cut' also available, I'm not too sure if they fillet at a cost or not though. They have fresh oysters in plastic containers and precut fish of the day(cheaper and about to get chucked out) and a long selection of imported frozen fish and the more exotic like sea turtle. 

I come here for the poultry selection as well. So many options with the cut selection of the chicken parts. Chicken breast is at better quality and expect it to be a bit more expensive than the average chinese supermarkets but inline with the quality offered at Costco.

It gets a bit pricier with the fresh produce as well, but weekly sales from cooking oil to exotic fruits is worth the visit. This location also houses quite an extensive filipino selection from chips, sweets,condiments, drinks and canned goods. 

Daily specials are available in their HOT FOOD selection like spicy shrimp, gazillion chicken dishes,fried veggies, the roasted pork and duck section, sushi and dessert section. Smartly placed towards the end of your errand before heading to the cashier as by this time, an appetite has been strategically created by the power of effective marketing."}
{"text":"Love this place.

Extremely diverse clientele.

Their pre-made food area is to die for. Lots of options, and they all taste good for the most part.

Great selection of Far East produce and goods. 

CLEAN!!!

I stop at this place every time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"The T&T Supermarket inside the Promenade Mall is the first T&T location in the GTA area. 

I also find it is not as nice as the newly opened one. The main problem is the aisle is so narrow. It is so hard to push your shopping carts around without bumming into everything!

Aside from that, it is still as good and busy as the other T&T locations! I love to shop here when I am in the area."}
{"text":"T&T is one of the cleanest and well-sort asian chinese supermarket in Toronto. To me, T&T is the best it can get!! althought things can be pricer compare to other asian chinese supermarkets but I would pay extra just because its cleaner and things are fresher. 

I love the fact that they have loads of chinese snacks, such as chips and candy from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.

I absoluetly LOVE this place!"}
