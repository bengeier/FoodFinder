{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and our families and a couple friends. The food was great. We are all huge fans of Chinese fare and frequent many places in Toronto. Our friend took us here because he said we had to try it. We were sceptical because of some of these reviews, however the food was amazing. Very authentic. The flavours were unbelievable and days after our dinner I already can't wait to go back. However, I would highly recommend going with someone who speaks Cantonese or Mandarin as the menus are not in English and if I had gone alone I fear I may have not been able to order all the really yummy stuff we got."}
{"text":"Borderline clich√© Chinese food restaurant, maybe I've gone to too many recently, but this one does NOT stand out. Worth trying at least once just to get it under your hat."}
{"text":"Coming here really redefined the meaning of \"rude\" for me. Coming from Indiana, I didn't realize how polite even the worst restaurants are in the Midwest. The waitress literally tossed everything onto our table. When we didn't understand her Cantonese, she yelled and pounded the table as if we were a bunch of idiots. They shouted the whole time. The dishes - they really are just OK. Average."}
{"text":"This place serves traditional canto cuisine. I ordered eggplant minced beef tofu pot, pork neck with green beans, and black bean clams. The first two dishes were very well cooked with lots of \"wok hey\", the last dish wasn't so good. The clams don't seem fresh and there isn't a lot of flavours.

The complimentary soup was good, not very salty. I enjoyed the complimentary red bean soups too, they weren't too sweet.

The decor here is just typical rusty canto restaurant look. The menu is pretty small and not much choice. I didn't see the combo dishes on menus either. 

The waitresses aren't too responsive. They are really busy I think they might be understaffed? 

The place is packed. If you don't have reservation then you'll have to line up if you come past 6:"}
{"text":"Worst service ever...we got together with four families near Chinese New Year and safe to say we're never coming back. The waitress was extremely rude, coughed on her hands and continued setting up tables, without washing her hands. So we politely brought this to the manager. Turns out he didnt even say sorry, although he was not rude. He just had nothing to say. What kind of management is that? The worst thing is that the entire staff up front started talking about us behind our backs. They were mocking us and shot stares at our table all night. They were cursing at us, saying how we had Alzheimer's because we had elderly people, and also said we had menopause to our ladies. Absolutely horrible and unacceptable. We didn't even get an apology all night. As they (the staff) were sitting around for dinner, they continued gossiping with other staff. They intentionally spoke up so we would hear, bullying us not thinking we would react to it since we're not an aggressive group.  14 of us walked out the door unhappy that evening. Three of the families came from overseas and it gave Canadians a bad image. Shame on them, it's unfortunate they had to go through this. They had never experienced such bad service elsewhere, and neither did my family. 
Perhaps they are still surviving because it's located in the busy Peach tree plaza, their food was ok, and the price is decent. If their service doesn't change, these factors won't make a difference. Good luck, and thanks for nothing on behalf of the 14 of us."}
{"text":"Treated my mom here for Mother's Day dinner yesterday. She ordered the golden salted egg yolk shrimp, chenpi (sun dried tangerine peel) garlic ribs, honey fried oysters, and then a bok choy with mushrooms.

Overall, I really did enjoy the meal. However, through our own fault, we found it to be very heavy and greasy as we simply ordered too much fried food. My mom was just too enthusiastic for us to try all her favourites and all the specialties of this restaurant! As such, we were KOed by the meal in less than half an hour. It felt like a Chinese McDonald's! 

The soup that we were given was very flavourful and sweet. The winter melon added the perfect balance to the tender salted pork (which literally fell off its bones and was marinated deliciously).

The oysters were very crispy and sweet. Each individual shrimp was massive, and came generously coated in salted duck yolk, fried to a perfect golden crisp. I wasn't as big a fan of the vegetable dish, as there was slightly too much cornstarch, rendering the glaze very heavy and overwhelming. The chenpi ribs also did not appeal to me... the tangerine flavour was just too strong.

We ended the meal with a slightly acidic version of a Chinese bean dessert (I have no clue why it was so acidic).

Overall, it was pretty good. Our server was quite rude, but we noticed that the other servers have a much better and more optimistic attitude. 

I would definitely recommend coming with a much larger group, so that you can try more variety and not feel as sluggish after all that fried goodness. Their portions are also massive, so keep that in mind too!"}
{"text":"The food here was not bad. For the price, the quality is pretty decent. We arrived around 530 PM on a Sunday night, the waitress asked us if we made reservations, we didn't. This restaurant gets really packed around 6:30 PM so I suggest making reservations if you're not going to go early (around 5:30 PM). Most of the tables are fairly large, for big groups or families, but there are a few 4 seaters. 

The service was okay. You could say that the waitresses give you time to choose your food, but could also be described as needing to be more attentive. They were mostly chatting away with the customers who always come to eat here while we were trying to get a hold of them to order. 

We ordered the 6 people course. The dishes were fairly large and tasted pretty decent. The soup that came before the dishes was very nicely done. It had a lot of melons such as canteloupe, pork, plums and honeydew. It wasn't too salty like most restaurants. I did also really enjoy the lobster cooked in Maggi sauce. The meat was very fresh and sweet. The coating of the lobster wasn't too floury or thick which was amazing. The sweet and sour pork was also cooked well. It was fried to a crisp and the sauce was nicely flavoured. The steamed fish was also very tasty and the meat was very fresh. 

The 6 people course also came with dessert. However, it was just grass jelly. It seemed like they didn't bother cooking up dessert (tong sui) and just cut up some grass jelly from the can. Although it still tasted okay, I wouldn't have guessed that they would just give grass jelly slices for dessert.

So food wise, this place is pretty decent, but service and the dessert could be improved a bit. Nonetheless, this place is worth going to."}
{"text":"Very satisfying meal! Delicious, efficient service, fresh seafood, there's heart and thoughtfulness that went into the cooking. 
Definitely a \"Top Choice\"!!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended.  The bathroom was dirty.  Menu was in Chinese.  The food was maginal. The prices were a little of the high side . They also charged for rice which I could not believe.  We spent about 200 for 8 . The food did come quickly."}
{"text":"My mom brought us to this restaurant and the food is excellent.  The sweet and sour pork is very crispy and a definitely must try if you like sweet and sour pork.  Stir fry beef and mushroom is very good, it has a good smoky firey taste that Chinese dishes should have!"}
{"text":"I've been here around 6/7 times and each time I wonder why I return.  It used to be a good place to get a nice, cheap satisfying meal but not anymore.  The place starting putting all their prices up and the size of the dishes decreased too.  But tonight the dishes have increased back in size.  The food here is around an average 3 * but the service is seriously lacking.  There are not enough wait staff, as the place is always full.  Tonight we had to ask for everything twice, as the first server never brought our rice, beer etc. 

I personally don't really recommend eating here.  The foods are expensive, most dishes are $12 + (but portions have significantly increased in size, from before), service is crappy, the place is a dive and there's always a massive line up."}
{"text":"There's not a lot of Chinese restaurants out there that serves authentic Asian dishes around anymore, but I'm glad Top Choice is still up and running.

The service here is your typical Chinese restaurant service: fast but not the friendliest yet efficient and more/less good service. 

Their stir fry dishes are what you expect from Chinese cuisine for the most part. Great sweet and sour pork and shredded chicken. Their glutinous rice is also a hit. Overall food is consistent with larger portions. 

If you're looking for authentic chinese cuisine I would definitely recommend Top Choice."}
{"text":"Will never come again. The food is getting salty and service is getting real sour. It feels like they don't care of business anymore. The owner told my friend to go to another restaurant. It was 15 min before closing and they turn part of the lights off ."}
{"text":"Expectations were high but not met on my first visit (we were a group of ten). Service was quick, but the staff had no charm or warmth whatsoever - a real turnoff and never a good sign when it's your immediate impression of a restaurant. The food was prepared with good 'wok heat' but the seasoning and taste factor of the dishes were spotty.  The complimentary soup that was served before the main courses was easily the best part of our meal. Sadly, it went south from there. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I've found that their service has been deteriorating in recent months/in the past year or so. Staff are quite pushy in getting you to order a large fish or lobster and although portions are on the larger end, dishes tend to be quite sloppily done and with excessive amounts of oil. A few times we've gone, our pork chops were still pink on the inside and definitely still raw! They're only open in the late afternoon onwards for dinner service and they get quite busy after 8:30pm so I'd suggest coming on the early end for a somewhat more peaceful dinner.

While they do have a menu with English on it, their seasonal specials are all in Chinese on the walls and most of their special menu is unfortunately exclusively in Chinese as well."}
{"text":"Came to Top Choice for an early dinner at around 5:45. The place was already 3/4 full. We were ushered to a table near the window. We decided to order the usuals: Sweet and sour pork (???), fish fillet with creamy corn sauce (????) and a tofu pot (?????). 

The food came quickly and the sweet and sour pork was no doubt the best dish. The pork was crispy yet not too greasy, and just fatty enough for our liking. It was so delicious! The fish fillets were drizzled in creamy corn sauce but was still crispy on the outside. The tofu pot lacked flavour but surprisingly had a lot of \"wok hey\" which was strange as it was supposed to be cooked in the claypot (not complaining here haha wok hey is hard to create and it shows how skillful a chef is).The portions were large compared to other chinese restaurants and they served complimentary soup at the beginning and ended the meal off with dessert (sweet red bean soup) . 

This place definitely live up to its name and is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. We will try out other dishes next time!"}
{"text":"I've almost forgotten about this one. Too many times have a drove past and neglected this place. This night, I was going to get it done regardless of the lineup.

It was a random weeknight and the place is packed. Fortunately for the snow storm it wasn't much of a wait. This place is ghetto and quite an aesthetic eye sore. With ugly metal chairs, kinda clean tables and weird dangling fish nets that's suppose to invoke feelings of being out in the sea perhaps? Not sure...

Aesthetics aside, this place just delivers plain old good Chinese food. The classics from steamed fish to sweet and sour pork and mui choy kau yuk (this one is not for the health conscious; delicious melt in your mouth fatty pork belly) are all here. In fact, this is traditional canto cuisine done right; oily, unapologetic with a lot of \"wok hey\". Everything is very well prepared from the complimentary soup to veggies, meat, fish..etc is flavourful and reminiscent of better times of the past. The days prior to this healthy eating movement; less oil, less heat, less salt...less flavours.

This isn't a place to bring your date and it sure isn't an anniversary spot either. However, if you are feeling like having great tradition Cantonese cuisine and don't really want to overpay for the fancy lighting, decor and service then this is for you."}
{"text":"My parents and I have heard of this place from a few friends, as it is quite popular amongst the Chinese community so we decided to come here for dinner on a chilly Sunday night. The restaurant itself is quite small and at 7PM there was already a long lineup by their entrance. Parking can be a nightmare here, as the lot is shared with Peachtree plaza and it's surrounding restaurants. 

We were told that we had to wait for 30 mins for a table for 5, as we did not make reservations, however we were quickly informed 10 mins later there was a table leaving. The menu itself is quite small, compared to other Chinese Restaurants and the prices for almost all dishes were above the $10 range. However the large portions made up for it. Out of the 5 dishes we ordered, the Sweet & Sour Pork was our favorite as it was crispy and were not small pieces of batter drenched in sauce. The service was pretty standard, they were quite understaffed on a busy Sunday night. I would definitely recommend this place for larger groups as they mainly only have large tables."}
{"text":"1. Terrible service
2. Overpriced menu
3. Dirty bathrooms 
4. Food is average

Not a returning customer for sure."}
{"text":"I came today to see why this restaurant is so busy all the time.  The reason revealed itself when we stepped into the restaurant: the menus were posted on wall on coloured paper showing that many of them costed $10 and under.

We ordered a fish hot pot ($10) and a deep fried pork rib with aged orange peels ($10).  The hot pot was very hot, and the food piled up high.  The base was mostly tofu, with pieces of fishes and mushrooms on top.  The hot pot was of good value, but the quality was just marginally better than food court food.  

The deep fried pork rib was a unique dish.  I originally thought the cook would use unflavoured aged orange peels.  But no, he used the orange peels from Chinese junk food packages.  People who have eaten the orange peel from Chinese junk food package know that it tastes rather sweet.  Consequently, the pork ribs were evenly coated with a batter that tasted a balance of savoury and sweet with bursts of orange flavour.  There was a lot of garlic bits to complement the aroma.  The batter was even and crunchy and the meat was thoroughly cooked and moist.  Let's say that I found this dish impressive.

The service was efficient; they seemed overworked though.

You will get good value for the money you spend.  The food quality fluctuates from dish to dish.  Though I didn't order it, I noticed that over one-third of all the tables during our stay ordered the sweet and sour pork; so I guess it is a safe choice.  I like their deep fried dishes.

The line up at door starts just before 7pm, so it is advisable to arrive early."}
{"text":"If you want good and decent price Chinese food, this is the place to go! Make sure you make reservations because this place is always packed unless you go after 8:30pm. They have a few combos which you can order, but I usually choose my own dishes. The ambiance is not the best but the food is good value! It's like those old school Cantonese restaurants."}
{"text":"This meal was to celebrate the return of electricity at my parents house after the winter ice storm which took out power for just over 4 nights. We wanted something nearby, quick, tasty and low price. So we drove over to New Kennedy Plaza and decided to go to one of the restaurants which we have never been to before. Even after living in the area for over 20 years and dozens upon dozens of visits to this plaza we have never been to Top Choice. We ordered the following:
1) oysters with broccoli
2) beef ribs
3) veggies (young snow pea's shoots)  
4) half a chicken
5) sweet and sour pork 

Everything was A Okay. Oysters were large and tasty, ribs were also good but a bit on the fatty side. Could have been more lean. Pork tasted good but wish it was more crispy instead of soggy. Meal came with the usual Chinese style soup for appetizers and red bean soup for dessert. All this fed 4 people and came to about $80 after tax and tips. No real big complaints. Overall a filling and good meal."}
{"text":"Top Choice Restaurant is the restaurant you go to in New Kennedy Square if nothing else is open. I mean, it's open to 1:30am for a reason!

I've been here a couple of times in the decade and bit I've been living in Markham, but never bothered keeping track of the dishes I ordered. I did this time! We ordered shredded chicken, clams with black bean sauce, satay beef fried noodles, and steamed water egg.

Nothing really stood out, but nothing was terrible in our books. The shredded chicken was shredded quite well (I hate it when there's large pieces not shredded), the steamed water egg had some duck egg pieces, which tasted a little different. The clams with black bean sauce was decent, but not \"out of this world\", and the satay beef fried noodles was mediocre.

We had the red bean paste for dessert, which also tasted decent but nothing spectacular.

Service was of expected quality for late night restaurants like this one, although it seemed only one of the four waitresses that night was even doing work, as the other three were just standing around chatting amongst themselves.

Meh."}

I swear each time we come here it gets 10x worse.

ATMOSPHERE
Pretty packed and busy on a weekday night, we were seated within 10 mins of arrival. BUT, the 10mins were because no server came to greet us and show us to our seats. Servers seemed to not give a rats ass and ignored us and other customers when we raised our hands to order. I had waited while 5 of the servers looked me dead in the eye and walked pass and not ask if they could help me. Deadass swear they were blind or I was wearing some next level camouflage / the invisible cloak from Harry Potter . We had to call the servers at least five times to order. We asked for white rice but the servers completely forgot and we had to ask again 3 times. When asked for the takeout boxes for our uneaten food, the servers ignored us so we had to go to the booth to get it ourselves. Funniest part is when we asked for the bill it seemed like the servers came to our way faster than Usain Bolt running the 100m.
Rating : 0.001/5.0 (Bill came hella fast gotta give them that)

FOOD
Pretty average styll. Food came out hot and had good seasoning. BUT HELLA OILY. After finishing one piece of pork/bok choi my bowl was covered in oil. I mean it's my own preference but I'd rather not have so much oil in my bowl that America would want to invade it .  We waited about 10mins for the food which was nice BUT when we ordered the bowls of white  rice we got them 10 mins after the food got here. The rice was a bit on the drier/ harder side.  I mean the rice came hot but our food became warm/ room temp which was a bummer.
Rating: 2.0/5.0

OVERALL
SERVICE IS HELLA BAD YO. If i wanted to wait that long to get my order taken I would've called Rogers customer service. McDonalds probably has better service. Food was pretty decent/ average compared to other restaurants in the area. Was close to home so we decided to stop by and try again. But did I talk about how bad the service was? Pretty bad. I'd come here if you want to get some good arm exercises in, probably kept my arm raised a good 25mins accumulatively.  Oh and no free wifi 

tl;dr Service was horrendous . Food was decent but quite oily. 

Overall Rating: 0.75/5.0"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants. I am not sure why there are only 3 stars here on yelp. But I order their sweet and sour pork every time I am here and it's unbeatable! It's really hard to make this dish well and this restaurant does justice to sweet and sour pork. They also have a $11.99 menu which is super good for those on a budget. This place is the neighbourhood Chinese diner for families."}
{"text":"First time dining in this place, food was very good, but waiting staffs are kind of rude, asked one of the server on a dish, she didn't explain what was inside of it, just sayin \"taste good\"(in Chinese) . This place was packed pretty quick after we've seated.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Okay.  Please read this because it'll probably save you a heart attack while eating.

The food here is very Chinese average with a range of menu that's decent to fulfill any dinner time cravings.

BUT...
They also have pets that live here - ughghaga#@#TT^8dsfjsdlfjdlsjdsgoiwejfioaefafsld cockroaches.  

They brought one of those portable gas burners for a dish that came in a pot... & then a cockroach fell out from the bottom of the burner. 

I almost died but apparently (according to my very Chinese) I wasn't allowed to do that.  

So my dad & one of the waitresses decided to wait until the cockroach wanted to venture out from the spinning glass tabletop to be squished.

Goodbye cockroach and goodbye appetite. 

Will I return here?
Hahaha..ahahahahahaha....
ahahahahahahah..."}
{"text":"Best sweet and sour pork I've ever had. It's good and only for $6.95.

My family of four eats here and orders 4 dishes for like $30-40. Delicious food.

Only downside is they speak limited English. Also the English menu is priced differently for some items than the Chinese menu. Thankfully my wife reads and speaks chinese, else we'd be paying an extra $1.50 for the sweet and sour pork dish. 

Each table also gets complimentary soup to start each meal."}
{"text":"Top Choice Restaurant is a great place if you dining in a small group. Their $6.95 special dishes are cheap on prices but not cheap on quality... and with that price, you can go ahead and order more dishes!!

Bittermelon with Beef ($6.95) and Mixed Veggie with Tofu ($6.95) were both served wokking hot, which is so important for Cantonese dishes. They both has a lot of flavours without being too salty. The bittermelon though was surprising has a hint of spiciness went well with the bitterness of the bittermelon.

Love the complimentary tofu pudding dessert!! It was served warm with real brown sugar syrup!!
 
Services was quick and efficient!! 

Top Choice Restaurant is open from 4 pm to 2 am... great for late night dinning!"}
