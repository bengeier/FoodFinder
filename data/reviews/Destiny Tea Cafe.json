{"text":"I find the customer service awful. I came with 7 friends, and we received styrofoam cups for water. I ordered the fries and onion rings and that order took way much longer than my friends who ordered bigger meals. Now, this is where it gets really bad; I saw my order coming and I see the guy holding my food almost drop an onion ring that touched his shirt and put it back in the bowl... Then, I see a waitress take a fry and eat it. I must say, awful awful service and I'm definitely NEVER going back again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and time after time it's been a disappointment.  The food is priced at a typical BBT place, but quality is not so great.  The drinks, I'm just lost for words at how terrible it is and the fact that there's no regulation or quality control.

The service... beyond words.  I was just there the other night and we did leave a typical tip of 10% because there was no service.  A waiter came around to just give us attitude for half the night, while one girl took all the boys' orders and left the girls out.  After we paid, a few of us went ouside to smoke while 2 of us were left at the table.  A waitress came back and pretended to be all cute with the bill and claimed that she would have to pay out of her own pocket should we not give her 10% tip.  I looked and calculated after taxes we were about $0.30 short of 10% but if we calculated before taxes we were definitely over that.

First of all, a place that doesn't have designated servers to tables cannot calculate a formula for the staff to pay out of their own pocket; unless it they calculate the totally revenue and the 10% off that and divide by the # of staff that night.  Secondly, I used to work at this location, so I know exactly how everything was calculated.  Mind you, I worked there when it had first opened, so maybe they have changed that, but for a waitress to come back to beg for $0.30 after terrible service?

I only go there because I get dragged by my other friends.  I used to come her when I worked here, because I knew who made the drinks and food, but now... this is something else."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in quite a long time (since that cockroach debacle which this place never truly recovered from, despite the huge renovation).   We didn't take off our coats as the temperature felt like 18C, far too cold in the winter time.  It's worth noting that temp might actually have been kept higher, but can't actually heat the place properly due to the truly cavernous space and two floors of seating.  

Service was not bad as far as attitudes goes, but they seemed pretty confused about orders in general. For the table behind us they kept getting the drinks wrong, and forgot the salad for their orders.  One guy kept walking around with a bowl of noodles trying to figure out which table it was for (to be fair, that's a fairly common sight).  

For ourselves, we ordered two set lunches, which included a drink,salad, and dessert. We also ordered octopus balls and fried calamari and an extra drink (there were 3 of us).

Food is ok, decent, although none of it was hot enough. The noodle soup that was part of one of the set lunches took much longer than the popcorn chicken meal and octopus balls. They completely forgot to order the calamari, which was fine bc the portions were larger than we thought, so we were full.  Food is definitely not freshly made, and clearly is the defrost, heat and serve kind of thing. 

Drinks were good, but since this place specializes in bubble tea, that is exactly what I would expect it to be.  Drink menu also has some interesting combinations that I would try at another time.  

All in all, it's an ok experience. Fixing the heating issue would probably go a long way.  My sister was not impressed with the service, but since I eat at Asian places a lot more than she does, I was ok with it.  In general, as long as they don't argue with me or are actually rude I'm fine.  Goes with the territory, right?"}
{"text":"Used to be my go to spot with friends, but just recently went there and hated my experience.

Entrance door is broken, there is no wifi, indoor lighting is limited, cash only, and I literally had to wave my hands frantically just to get the servers attention (had to wait 10 minutes until someone came). After we ordered they just let us know everyone in the group had to order something. No thanks, we just left."}
{"text":"A 'conditional' pass was posted outside the place; already a sign for the worst. We were seated and there was a cold draft continuously present, with only a candle to try to warm ourselves with little success. Waitress forgets the menus and ignores us until my behemoth of a friend interrupts her. Said waitress mentions a service charge after we order. Waitress hurries back saying the menu wasn't updated and one of the items we ordered was more expensive then what was written on the menu. Waiter messes up the drinks and takes 10 minutes to make a new one--how do you confuse a cold milk bubble tea with tapioca for a cappuccino?? Total time it takes for all of us to get what we ordered: approximately an hour. Waitress says we can only split the bill four ways--there were 8, 9 of us. Just 'shoos' us out as we leave.

One star for the d√©cor, lights were pretty if a little dim. Shame the service is so shitty. Food was also bland and tea was excessively sweet, like everything was premade. This place is good to break up with someone I guess, or to ruin someone's day in general."}
{"text":"If I could only rate this a zero I would. This place is horrendous. The service was awful and the card machine was not working. They also require everyone to order one item so you cannot even share their overly priced mediocre food. Upon entering, the door was broken and the place was too dark. We wondered if they missed their payment for hydro because of the lack of lighting and broken machine. No one came to our table to take our order and we waited a while for someone to notice our hand waving. While ordering food, the rude woman told us that they were not serving certain food on their menu. Why are they still open? We left and did not continue our order. We have decided to no longer visit this place and we are currently at Go For Tea where we are treated with respect and welcomed with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"yeah...took 30 mins to serve us after we yelled for the server...servers sucked...asked for cups...4 of us got glass cups 5 got Styrofoam...if you ask for napkinS they give you one..for whoever asked. when the food is served they don't tell you or ask who got what so you end up trying to figure out who got what yourself..."}
{"text":"I only come here because they will always have a table, green grotto is much better. I've tried their milk tea and it taste just like powdered milk. They updated their menu and has Hokkaido milk tea and I tried it... It tasted weird."}
{"text":"The space is huge and the decor is modern and sleek but those are the only positive things I can really say about the venue. The service is quite slow and the staff's use of English seems limited.

For the price, quality is definitely lacking. I ordered a matcha latte, expecting a frothy milky beverage but it was incredibly watery. Dining in, I was surprised that the beverages all came in plastic cups. Wasn't worth the $5.95, Starbucks has better green tea latte!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. Dined last night with a party of 8, when we arrived we were seated upstairs. My friend's ramen order never came and we asked them for an update 40 mins into the meal, they said they didn't punch the order in (at least they were honest) but we said it was already too late, and they unwillingly accepted us cancelling the order. When the bill came, we were charged a 15% service charge (on the total including tax which is illegal btw) because apparently we were seated upstairs (never told to us), because we have a party of 8 or more (never told to us), and because our total bill came to $80 or more (never told to us). Well we pushed back to the server (poor girl) and her manager about never being informed of these charges, about our missing dish (which apparently counts toward the 8 guest count), about our total not even reaching $80, and the manager's response was \"IT'S PRINTED IN THE MENU\". I finally convinced them to print a bill without the service charge after a lot of back and forth arguing, we paid and left zero tip. It was an awful experience and no elements of the service warranted any kind of tip let alone 15% on the gross total."}
{"text":"Went to Destiny after my meal with a friend to get some desserts. It was an unintentional visit to be honest but since we were nearby and craving desserts, we went there. 

First walked in and noticed some new decor, it was a lot brighter than it used to be .. (which I don't like) and they removed one section of booths and got new (low and small) one seater sofas. I have also noticed that they weren't busy. Not even half of the place was filled (which in my opinion is weird because Destiny has always been a hit spot...what happened?)

They got a whole new menu going on (same sort of food just menu layout and some items are really different) I have also noticed that the stuff there has gotten a lot more appealing and of course, more expensive. 

I ordered a Truffle Royale (pretty much like a double chocolate fudge mousse cake) and my friend ordered a Seasonal Fruit Crepe. The cake was approximately $8.95 and the crepe was $10.95 (that's ... pretty expensive)

The plates arrived and boy did they look amazing. The cake was REALLY sweet but I was craving chocolate so I didn't mind it so much.

Service was pretty slow considering how slow their business was. Seemed like everyone was just around to chat and not really serve. We honestly did not need to press the button at the table for service twice when the whole place is pretty open concept. (we were sitting right in front of the service bar separated by glass dividers.

Overall experience was decent, not something I really would be going to if needed. I haven't seen a Destiny so quiet in a long time so perhaps there's a good reason behind it."}
{"text":"First time here after renovations. The decor definitely received an upgrade. Menu is now more geared towards food items (both entrees and dessert options). Did not have a chance to try the food as I arrived after dinner. Drinks are not as good as dedicated shops (like The Alley) but you're mainly paying for a nice place to sit and chat.

There is no longer live music at night, as the stage has been removed.

A nice place to gather at with friends. Would recommend."}
{"text":"worst tea spot ever. Cannot support large groups, unhelpful and rude staff would not allow us to separate the bill as well as adding random fees for being such a large group (excluding gratuity)"}
{"text":"Scam!!  Check your bill. They charged us a 12% service fee on top of taxes. Came in with 4 adults and 4 children, ordered 7 drinks and it cost us $65. When it came time to pay, the server showed the bill but didn't give it to me. I paid with visa and added a 15% tip on the machine. She started to walk away and I asked her for my copy...she gave it to me and took off. Bad service, average quality drinks and total rip off prices and hidden fees. Will never be back."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was around 2pm on a Wednesday. There were very few people inside. It took a while for us to get the waitress' attention. When she did come though, I tried to order one of their desserts and she said they only serve that dessert at 7pm. And then I tried to order another dessert but they discontinued making it. So I ended up ordering shaved ice. And then I got bubble tea of which the waitress recommended. After 20 minutes or so the waitress comes back and tells us their ice machine isn't on so I need to pick something else from the menu....? So I tried to get cake and majority of the slices weren't available so I got a slice of chocolate cake. My order came 45 minutes later. The cake was good but the presentation was 2/10. It was literally a slice of cake and a bit of whip cream on the side? and my bubble tea was pretty good except the tapioca was really soft on the outside and hard on the inside like it has been sitting out for too long. I don't know if the menu is always like that or the waitress or chef really didn't want to make the desserts we wanted. Overall the whole experience was a joke."}
{"text":"Iced Matcha Latte:
Price: $5.95(S) + $.50 Tapioca

Was not sweet, but really strong matcha flavour. The only sweetness I was getting was from the tapioca.
Be sure to ask them to add sugar.

Iced Matcha Latte: 2/5


Honeydew Sugar Gourd Milk:
Price: $5.95(S) + $1.00 Lychee Jelly

Milky consistency, adding lychee really conplimented the honeydew. There are other jelly flavours if you are not a lychee kinda person. 

Honeydew: 4/5


Overally the decor of the resturant was fun, with funky chairs and 2 floors looking down. There is a game section, where you have a variety of boardgames or cards to choose from.

{"text":"Destiny Tea cafe is the only bubble tea cafe that I would ever go too. It's huge and its too stuffy like all the other bubble tea shops. The food was a hit and miss,mostly hits. 

Service was alright, waitresses could be a little more diligent."}
{"text":"BAD. I can not begin to explain how bad it has become. I have been coming for over 5 years and I went last night after a long time. The menu has changed and not for the good. The smoothies tasted like water mix with ice and a drop of flavoured syrup. This used to be my favorite tea place. The place is still very classy and the new renovation is definitely very nice but the food quality has gone down soooo badly which makes me very sad. I used to love going here with my family but will never go back again and now will have to look for a new place."}
{"text":"Professional. Loved having the ability to press buttons to get service, water and the bill. Unfortunately, the staff doesn't really speak a lot of English so it's a bit difficult to customize the order. 

I ordered cake slices and a mango smoothie with mango jelly and tapioca. It was literally mango pulp, but with a generous portion of the jelly and tapioca. 

The cakes were ok. I may return."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place almost 3-4 times a week every summer for years, the service was OK and the food was good. Since the renovations this past summer, they increased their prices again to obscene numbers. I went with a group of 7 where we were put onto a small table. I tried the rice bowl with Taiwanese sausage, which is almost always good no matter where you go and was a safe choice before their renovations... Or so I thought. Besides the bowl being very small, it was mainly rice with only 6 thin slices of the sausage. Let's just say it wasn't worth $11. My companions were less than impressed with their meals which cost $3 more but was the same size. 

The service from the staff was pretty good and they walked by fairly often to make sure we had everything we needed. 

Once we decided to leave, they said we could only have a max of 4 separate bills (should have known this was still their policy since it was before the renovations). We figured out who would pay for who, some needing to pay by card while others had cash. When we went up to go pay we were then told they do not accept any card and there was an ATM behind us. A little bit shocking considering they have meal dishes that cost $75.99.

Maybe I'm just more baffled because I knew how it was before where the meal sizes were decent, prices fair, and they accepted card.. But I don't think I will ever come back or recommend this location"}
{"text":"\"The one with the nice comfy sofas upstairs.\"

The Good:
Great interior (looks like a night club after the renovations); free wi-fi; drinks are decent; very large with many tables; no limit for upstairs now (minimum of 6 people however); 

The Bad:
\"Large\" drinks and \"Small\" drinks are the same size?; Might get packed sometimes; food is somewhat not worth it

Overview:
Ever since they renovated the place (coincided with the \"cockroach\" scandal where their business just tanked) it looks much more contemporary in styling (resembles a downtown lounge, but I don't believe they don't serve alcohol); however I don't think their menus/quality have changed much so if you're one of the many who've been here before their renovations, don't expect much. Drinks are reasonably priced but the food is somewhat expensive for the portions that you get. You don't really go there for the food though - it's more for just sitting around and hanging out with friends which I'm glad to say has improved a lot.  I really like the renovated upstairs: there's no longer a minimum charge to sit upstairs rather now you need a minimum party size of 6. The sofas they have upstairs are really comfy! There's also free wi-fi which may also be a bad thing since I saw many high schoolers studying there, occupying much of the available seating. I had the Green Apple Green Tea with Tapioca (my favorite) and it tasted alright, nothing exceptional. But like you probably know, Destiny's quality in the past has varied from day to day depending on who prepared the drink. Mine was OK, but I've had friends who have complained about watered down drinks, tapioca being too hard, etc. Hopefully they're more consistent now with their \"new look\". 

Service can be slow sometimes, especially when we went after the renovations and sat upstairs. They basically have one person servicing the entire top area and it was pretty hard to wave the person down. 

One beef that I had with this place was that I had to pay $1.00 extra for a \"large\" drink but when the drinks arrived, we noticed no difference at all between the small and the large drinks. Maybe there was actually more in the cup itself, or maybe they made a mistake but I doubt it since two of us ordered large and three of us ordered small, but we all had the same size. Just a heads-up to all readers to ask what the difference is, if any.

Overall, a nice place to sit and hang with friends but don't expect the best quality beverages."}
{"text":"Love coming back to Destiny for a nice drink, sometimes dinner. Place always gets a bad rep based on their service. It is a hugggge restaurant and people should understand we are only human. Will definitely come back, well known spot!"}
{"text":"Someone works in Destiny who told me the owner doesn't pay the salary to the employee ontime. Thats why their service is lacklustre. It's the time to close down the Destiny!!!!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from downtown toronto to this location only to be disappointed  that they closed 1 hour early... I can't believe it"}
{"text":"This place was often chosen by my peers due to Destiny's proximity to my neighbourhood (as in, a 10-minute walk), but that's all that's going for this place. 

Their seafood udon noodles are filled with sand, salty, and otherwise flavourless. Beef noodles in soup don't have the sand, but still taste just as terrible. 

Their bubble teas are okay. I had them before the cockroach incident erupted, and they seemed to taste fine. 

Servers will come to your table only if you walk up to the cashier's desk. And even then, it took about 20 minutes before dishes started arriving. The worst part: they include tips into your bill. Yes, you are forced to pay tips, regardless of how bad the service was."}
{"text":"Their bubble tea and food options are great. It's always packed when I come here on weekends. Service can be a bit slow at times. I really like their strawberry and taro slush bubble teas."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times already. Let me sum up the pros and cons of visiting this cafe.

Pros:
-Huge selection of bubble teas/slush/fruit teas
-Yummy bubble tea with ice cream
-Nice selection of snacks
-Lots of magazines for you to browse

Cons:
-COLD! we have been here a couple of times and it is cold all the time. We had to keep out coats on while eating and we still feel cold. As someone who is really afraid of cold, I would probably not visit this place due to the lack of heating.

-service is not really good. The servers are not really friendly and attentive. Not really efficient either.

-Quite pricey and mediocre food.

-only accept cash"}
{"text":"Went to get bubble tea at 4pm for its buy one get one free deal. DAMN, i ordered the mango ice cream with tapioca and did they full it to the brim. For bubble tea, its around $6. Its probably worth it with the deal."}
{"text":"Mired in unconfirmed scandals regarding cockroach problems and tapioca recycling, I decided to take a detour from my usual Highway 7 bubble tea destinations to check this location out. Its bubble tea tastes the same as the Highway 7 location, and its atmosphere is almost as inviting. However, if you're looking for quality bubble tea, this isn't necessarily the best place to go."}
{"text":"Awful minimum charge policy. Not clear how it would even work.

They ask for a minimum of $4.49/person plus a 15% fee per every two and a half hours. Seems fair until you later learn they want each of your party members to purchase a menu item whether or not you want or can consume items from their menu. Further, even though they request each member order a separate item, they refuse to split bills more than four way, resulting in you having to negotiate with your friends on who wants to cover the tab.

Last but not least, any additional members of your group coming late (had a friend pop in for roughly a half hour near the end of our visit) will also be charged their minimum despite not being served at all.

Lousy policy, especially considering they even charge you to play your own card games. I consider this visit a lesson and know better now to not return here unless I feel like performing mental acrobatics in attempting to understand their policies. It's clear they hope to squeeze as much money out of you and your friends as possible."}
{"text":"the food is great. but bad service. Asked for a basil chicken dish, but when the waiter brought our food, we had beef.
Refused to take back our order and insisted that \"the beef dish is really good\" \"it's really popular\" and forced us to take it."}
{"text":"You know with so many options around for desserts and Asian drinks nowadays, it's hard to satisfy a typical customer.  

I'd say this place maintains a pretty good standard of service but then the food quality at this location is sub-par.  It usually doesn't sit that well with me the next day lol...maybe it's the msg or super salty levels?  Drinks are not bad though, but they increases the price write a bit ever since the renovations. 

I actually rather go to the hwy7/east beaver creek location when I am able to.  But this spot is convenient to get some studying done until 2am (3am for Fri/sat).

The service bumps it up to three stars.  Otherwise I might have given this place 2 stars bc of the price to value ratio.

I'd say overall it's ok.  Just don't have super high expectations and you can still have a great time here =P"}
{"text":"Previous experience was decent but this time it was awful. The tapioca was CLEARLY overcooked, I can make better milk tea with my tea bag and milk! The crepe was good but no whip cream? Come on dudes. The waffle was SOUR and had no sauce, the ice cream saved the entire meal. Service was slow except they didn't even light the candle. Like why leave it on the table if you're not gonna light it? When we asked for water, they gave us lukewarm water...the worst kind. When we wanted to leave, we couldn't even cause no one came, we raised our arm for so long my friend could've finished a league game. Waiter didn't even know how to separate a bill...Would not recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to destiny for a long time. The bad reviews are probably rating Destiny on its food, but Destiny has never been about the food. There are many places to grab a snack around Destiny, and Pacific Mall is across the street. Destiny gets my five star review because of its bubble tea. Even though Go for Tea and Green Grotto have popped up around the city, I still think that Destiny has the best variety and quality of bubble tea.

They are working harder to make their snacks palatable, so there's something to look forward to."}
{"text":"Oh, Destiny, you're trying so hard to pick yourself up after the \"cockroach incident\"... and it just isn't working.  Having closed after the incident, it re-envisioned itself as a modern, cavernous lounge from its previous Asian dark wood interior.  The crowds haven't come back though, and I wouldn't have come back at all either if someone in the group didn't insist on visiting (having not heard of the incident as I later found out while sipping on my drink).

Here's a question: if so much money was spent on interior design to make it look a bit more upscale, why are we being served out of plastic cups?  For upwards of $5 a drink in a sit down place, I expect to be served in something a little more... ceramic or maybe glass?  Everyone in my group felt like we were drinking overpriced takeout bubble tea in an environment that is just trying much too hard to be hip and hitting all the wrong notes. 

We were sitting on the second floor which has some super slouchy couches.  After taking down our drink orders, the drinks in the aforementioned plastic cups came pretty quickly, which was nice.  When it came time to pay, however, the lone waitress for the entire upstairs floor was very difficult to flag down.  Also, we quickly noticed that the sound system doesn't really extend to this floor.  Whether this is a good or bad thing is a toss up - at least we could hear each other talk.

The drinks:
Mango slush. 2 people in the group had this.  One said it was super mango-y.  The other was unimpressed.  \"It tastes like something from 7/11.\" \"It tastes very artificial - like they put too much powder in it.\"

Fresh fruit yogurt - Kiwi.  They didn't skimp on the fruit for $5.99, which was good.  For a yogurt drink, it was more watery and milky rather than the 'yogurty' drink that you'd expect.

Taro ice cream drink.  My friend had expected taro ice cream.  What he got was vanilla ice cream with some purple taro syrup on top.  For $6.99, he was expecting something a bit more exotic and authentic.

Honeydew milk tea.  It was OK.  A bit too sweet, but OK.

Mango green tea with lychee jelly.  Lots of lychee deliciousness, which is great... but where's the mango taste?  Other than neon yellow colouring, I could have been having a lychee green tea.

Jasmine tea.  Lovely scent... coming out of a paper cup... for $3.99.

Destiny is trying really hard, down to the 20% off cakes for the holidays and the short short short briefs that the waitresses are wearing as uniforms *shakes head*.  It's good for large groups in a relaxed, roomy, uptown location.  Just not worth going back to for overpriced sugar water though."}
{"text":"Orders take a long time, food is decent, but the environment is very nice and relaxed. Good spot for a date or catching up with friends. It's kind of expensive for what you are paying for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! open super late, i came here on a sunday night looking for my midnight snack. 

the super thick texas toast with coconut and condensed milk (super fatty but it tastes heavenly.)

milk tea with boba

mango slush (they use real fruit here by the way) with tapioca and aloe. SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD, served in this enormous glass.

the menu is pretty extensive as far as teas are concerned. all the fruit stuff is made from fresh fruit and seem like theyre super good, they have some exotic flavors that i haven't tried before too. 

the place is furnished in all wood with an asian theme, very elaborate. nothing like what we have in San francisco. seats a lot of people, no wait, service was pretty quick, and they don't expect you to get up and leave after you're done eating. people stick around and hang out and chill, read magazines, play games, listen to chinese music. overall young crowd of chinese locals hang out here at night.

unlike san francisco, theres PLENTY of parking in the lot."}
{"text":"I ordered the tapioca and pudding milk tea. If not for the current B1G1 offer, I would be really upset with my drink. It was way too sweet and seemed artificially flavored with coconut syrup. The texture of the tapioca was a bit too soft and they weren't very generous with the amount of pudding given. 
This was my first experience with Destiny and it definitely did not convince me to want to come back."}
{"text":"Very nice interior and a second floor with lots of tables for larger parties and they allow for card games etc. I don't really like their bubble tead or other drinks find the one nearby like cha time and go for tea better. But on a night with friends definitely a good spot to hang out and have a good selection of hot and cold drinks as well as different desserts and cakes."}
{"text":"1 Star,  only for their decor
Service is horrible,  waitresses are always on their phone taking their time. 
They finally installed service buttons to call them.
Food is very mediocre here. 
Drinks come in nice cups but they're so meh

So come here for drinks or late night snaking is OK when no where else is open..

They normally closed late 2am on weekdays
But I came today at 1am and they're closed!!! 
Drove all the way in the snow and so far and only know them for being open late and they're closed
So disappointed... No notice or note apologizing or explains why they just decided to be closed...
GO FOR TEA IS OPEN go here instead"}
{"text":"I came to write how bad the service is at this place but I guess it's the norm from reading the other reviews. The whole story would be very long but to shorten it...this place scams you by making you pay 15% service charge for the following reasons: over table of 8, if you sit upstairs, if your bill is over $80, or if you get separate bills. (Mind you I've asked for separate bills before at this place and they literally separated the price 10 ways....) This is ridiculous since they manage to get the orders all mixed up or completely forget your order. Come here if you want mediocre food and horrible service. I would give this place no stars."}
{"text":"A lot of people come here because they think it's a 'cool' place to go. Its a place where young kids go to hang out. But with subpar food and drinks, it seems to me that destiny's success merely lives on these experiences. I went here because I was one of those kids. Now that I've grown up, it looks like destiny success is a mix of luck, social status, decor and location."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a group gathering, however sometimes it gets too noisy. I love their bubble tea but sometimes I find that their tapioca isn't fresh, probably because the demand for tapioca isn't high."}
{"text":"As usual, lousy service.  Actually wait... there has to BE service for me to actually deem it lousy... I ordered the Date & Longan Tea and my DC had the Avocado Milk Tea.  We also ordered Pad Thai and the Spicy Popcorn Chicken.  

The milk tea didn't taste anything like avocado. If anything, it tasted more like banana.  But you can't expect much from artificially flavoured powder.  (For the REAL stuff, go to Ten Ren).  The Date & Longan tea was good - not overly sweet.

On to our food.  First and foremost, they need to hire new dish washers, or just plainly open their eyes and look before giving dirty utensils to your customers.  It was gross!  The popcorn chicken sucks compared to Go For Tea.  The batter was not as good, and the chunks of chicken are huge.  Popcorn chicken tastes better in smaller chunks because its crispier.  The Pad Thai was kind of bland, and the lime wedge that accompanied it was so dry.  I went to squeeze it and I think 2 or 3 drops came out f it (and it wasn't like it was a small lime wedge either).  

We only came here because Go For Tea was too long a wait."}
{"text":"This place has been around for quite a long time. I remember going here over 10 years ago when it had a traditional teahouse look!

I stopped going to it for a few years cause it didn't really interest me. But for the last little bit I've gone to it a few times and usually had a pleasant experience.

When I went a couple days ago with my mom, it was a Tuesday night so it was basically empty. We went there for a semi-late dinner. I ordered the popcorn chicken with rice, my mom ordered fried pork cutlet ramen, and also a large strawberry milkshake to share.

The popcorn chicken rice has always been good, chicken is nice and crispy and fresh tasting. The ramen however, lacked flavour and the pork cutlet was dry and did not really taste like anything. Only negative to this experience. My mom and I only finished it because we were pretty hungry. The strawberry milkshake was good, not a traditional milkshake though. It was basically a strawberry slush with a milk base as it was pretty icy like a slush and lacked the consistency of a typical milkshake.

This is probably the only bubble tea place aside from chamecha that serves good savoury food. The bubbletea is pretty good in my opinion and the service is alright, not the best on busy nights."}
{"text":"Came here on two occasions with a group of friends. On both occasions, service was pretty bad. The staff there had given the wrong change to my friend 2 times in a row. In addition to this, it was very hard getting any waiter's attention and as such, service was slow. 
As for the drinks, they were pretty standard. On my first visit I had gotten a matcha drink and felt that the matcha taste could have been stronger. On my second visit, I had a taro milkshake and that was alright, although in my opinion it tasted a little watery. 
Although I have no big complaints about the drinks themselves, the price was really not worth it. After tax and tip, a large drink with tapioca can come close to $10, if not surpass $10. Th
The only thing that makes me like this place is that they have live music, and the performers are pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here many times for lunch but this was my first time coming here for dinner. Came with my family and we ordered 3 ramens and the crispy Taiwanese chicken, as well as a brown sugar latte. I found the ramen really nice but needed a bit more salt tbh. Everything else was great. I did not know that there were performances on Friday nights. So we arrived around 8:15pm with little people and around 8:30pm there was a performance from a young man who played guitar and sang both English and Chinese songs. I found it very entertaining because I am a singer myself, and more people started coming in. Overall, everything was wonderful and the atmosphere was calming."}
{"text":"We came with a group of like 20 people and they only allowed us to split 4 bills. How do we do that?? Food was medicore"}
{"text":"Nothing special that stood out to me. The food came out in parts - one dish at a time, so we had to wait until it ALL came out before we could start eating. Also, one was cold when it came out, which shouldn't have happened. Service was not good - they kept walking by but didn't acknowledge if we wanted a refill on water or anything. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good place to go to for late night dinners, yummy tea and bubble tea selections, big food selections from rice, stir-fry noodles, noodles soup, dessert and apps. Only thing that sucks here is service"}
{"text":"The bubble tea was alright. I was amazed at how big it was.

On the downside, the service was terrible. It took over 30 minutes for us to get our orders taken and another 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Really? How hard is it to make a strawberry milk tea? Of course, I can't make that stuff myself..."}
{"text":"I think I only come here for the convenience but not if I had a choice with other places. I don't find their drinks amazing...I find them alright. The service is lacklustre. If you find a drink that tastes good, stick to it. I tried to enjoy other drinks and they sometimes taste awful. They're quality is not consistent so sometimes you'll have a delicious drink and other times you won't. The waitstaff may ignore you unless you really flag them down, especially when you sit in an area that is a bit hidden."}
{"text":"Not cool. We were a group of 10, and they put us up on the 2nd floor. Given that there were two or three parties up there, I would think it would make sense to have at least one server up there at (almost) all times, but this wasn't the case. They also don't have buzzers, so if we wanted service when there was no one upstairs, we had to go downstairs and flag someone down. Considering that there was a minimum charge of $4.95/person, and they charge a mandatory tip of 15% if your group is over eight people and spend over $80, I expect service to be much better. Oh. They're also cash only even though they have Visa and Interac (I think) signs up on their door.

A number of us ordered drinks. Some of us ordered desserts. A few of us also ordered meals. I ordered their salt and spicy combo ($8.99). Beside the menu item, there were a number of assorted foods in a bracket. Generally, this means menu item description, no? When I ordered, the waitress said I could pick three of the assorted food items in the brackets. Nowhere on the menu (at least in English) did it say that I could only pick three. I thought I was getting them all. Not cool. I still ordered it. I got the Taiwanese sausage (which really didn't need the additional salt and pepper, the fried tofu, and the popcorn chicken). It was alright, but misleading. 

Drinks: I heard the lychee slush (?) was super sweet. It looked like it was 70% foam, and 30% liquid. Not sure what that was about. When the server put down the drinks we ordered, he just deposited six drinks on the table and just walked away. He didn't tell us which ones were which. We had to flag him down to tell us. It's a good thing we did, because there was a drink there we didn't order, and one of the girls was missing her drink (dragonfruit slush). When we had all received our food, she still hadn't received her drink, so I asked after it. The server went to check on it, then came up and told us they didn't have that drink that day. Okay. Why didn't they tell us that as soon as they tried to enter it into the machine? She opts for an avocado and banana juice. The waitress says she doesn't think they have avocado, but she'll check. She leaves and doesn't come back, so we assume they have avocado, or they've forgotten about her again. At this point, we're assuming the second but hoping for the first. After we're done all our food, desserts, and other drinks, they still haven't brought her drink. We ask again. They go downstairs and check, come up and tell us that once again, they don't have her drink. At this point, we tell them she's not ordering, and we pay and leave. We still pay the mandatory tip for this lack of hospitality. It's quite sad, really. For the number of patrons in the restaurant and the number of servers I saw, they should have had more than enough manpower to serve us properly. I don't know if this can be attributed to lack of training or lack of management. Either way, I haven't had service this poor in a long time.

That night really wasn't that girl's night. From her seat, she could see into the kitchen. She told us she saw one of the kitchen people pour something into a blender, stick his hand in, then lick his hand. I'm inclined to believe her. 

The food was alright, but given the atrocious service, I wouldn't recommend Destiny's to anyone. In fact, I might go out of my way to convince people not to come."}
{"text":"This place has gotten considerable worse from last time. Although they have renovated and changed their menu, their service was extremely slow. We were at the venue with a large group hoping to play some board games in the separate private room as we did last year. However, that room was closed off and supposedly sold as a separate unit. Although I understand that they didn't need the extra space, it was a great area for a large group.

Drinks were somewhat too sweet despite telling them half sugar. I order a cold mango drink which was good especially with real pieces of mango albeit small pieces. After an hour or two, I ordered another drink which was hot given that the first drink made me cold. The ginger milk tea was way too sweet as I had told them half sugar.  They also included a pack of sugar in case I needed more sugar to bounce off their walls.

The entire group ended up upstairs separate from the main area of the bubble tea place. Since we had almost 40 people, we had each table settle the bill once all the orders had arrived. However, with only 1 waitress serving us, it appeared that they were understaffed and I felt that she didn't want to be there despite the mandatory 15% tip."}
{"text":"This place is MONSTER huge and I just can't understand why! love the renovations, pretty chic compared to what it looked like before. Been here a few times and always satisfied with my Taro bubble tea with coconut jelly.

The service needs improvement mos def. Seriously, whats going on. I can't really comment on the menu as I only get my usual bubble tea from here... though once I got some kind of slushie and it was ok.

I just read Karen S's comments about the \"cockroach incident\" .... yes cockroaches! shut down? LOL that explains so much. Gotta give Destiny an A for effort though, they are definitely trying hard to embrace their new image.

I don't know if I'll be coming back here... not worth the wait times or the horrible service."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Nothing special really. Mediocre. I would recomment going to the Richmond Hill location."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 star and will very much return. It's definitely one of the nicer dessert places and similar to ten Ren tea time in Markham.

Food: 4/5, I got the taro mix and it's one of the best I've ever had.  The crepe and waffle desserts are very standard.  The mocha mix was lacklustre.

Service: 2.5/5, they come quick when you press the button but make little mistakes like not bringing enough dishes or not knowing about the menu items that they need to ask someone else.

Ambience: 4/5, very cool atmosphere with very comfortable seating, live music etc. Just don't sit near the windows as it can get very cold.

Price: 3/5, it's a little up there but worth it for the ambience. About $10 per person minimum"}
{"text":"Considering that the menu has changed and with a bit of renovation on the other side (changed to lounge area), destiny is trying to Make a come back. 

Food:
Pretty good, limited selection but you can tell there's effort put into making these dishes. 

Drinks:
Hokkaido milk tea is actually surprisingly yummy!
I haven't tried anything else because this is a really good drink! 


Service:
They have a service button now so instead of waiting to meet eyes with the server, you could click the button for: water, service, Bill, and cancel."}
{"text":"The waiter and hostess was nice and attentive. I was amazed at their lunch special. The price was affordable and the portion size was huge. I only wished they played music because it was dead silence."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place.  The drinks are terrible.  Watered down and terrible tea-quality. Tapioca is also overcooked.  It's night and day compared to Chatime and Ten Ren's.  The bubble tea at Pacific Mall and First Markham Place is better and cheaper.

As for food, I've only tried the popcorn chicken and it's decent.  However, it doesn't come with any sauce.  If you ask for sauce, they'll give you sriracha and ketchup.  Mayo would be nice.

As for the servers, they have no idea what's going on.  They constantly have to seek others for answers.

The other day, I ordered a \"QQ Milk Tea\" which is $5.95.  A \"QQ\" includes both tapioca and jelly.  That's how the other tea houses serve it.  However, at Destiny, they do not include jelly.  I spoke with 3 different servers and they all said the same thing.  I asked them \"If QQ Milk Tea does not include jelly, what's the difference between this and a regular Milk Tea with Tapioca at $4.95?  Why would I pay an extra $1.00 for the same thing?\"  They were shocked and realized that they fucked up.  Anyway, they ended up charging me for the regular milk tea with tapioca at $4.95 but it was a bit of a mission trying to explain everything to them.

One positive thing about this place is the live musician.  She was playing the piano and singing.  If the tea and service wasn't so poor, I'd return quite often just so I can listen to the musician."}
{"text":"Destiny has undergone many many changes over the years. I haven't been here for years but recently came by after the latest renovations were made. The renovations has made Destiny feel a more upscale sit-down bubble tea caf√© which also offers more variety of food and snacks. Prices are slightly higher than your average bubble tea. Personally, I enjoy their bubble tea as its good quality and an interesting array of bubble tea flavours and combinations. I ordered the fried chicken, popcorn and Strawberry gelato bubble tea. The hot snacks are a nice addition to destiny as most sit-down bubble tea have their snacks paired with their bubble tea. You can also come here and order light to moderate meals for dinner. The overall interior layout of Destiny looks nicer and fancier. Tables and chairs are comfy and clean. Customer service was alright. It seems the waitresses serving us didn't have a good comprehension of the English language as they struggled to understand what I was trying to order. I feel Destiny has become a better hangout spot, great place to sit-down and have bubble tea or simply come here to study. Overall, a decent place for your bubble tea fix. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice (both times, during the afternoon) - and both times, the drinks did not disappoint! Desserts were really good as well! The decor is very modern and sleek, washrooms were really clean and staff were accommodating. The lunch menu that they offer was really nice, especially price wise. Everything else on the regular menu is rather pricey though. Apart from that, it is definitely a place to go to, especially for a get together with friends."}
{"text":"Bad service and the bubble tea is sub-par to Chinatown one. The space and atmosphere was nice but what made the bubble tea taste awful was the customer service. Theres none i rather have no service then awful service. Mandatory tips too and you cant play card games or any games in the venue. Lost my business Would not return here again. Theres better places in the area!"}
{"text":"Decor is cool, though there is construction. 
Service was pretty inattentive. Hot pot chicken was seriously undercooked."}
{"text":"Anyone who was online may remember reading the famous cockroach debacle posted on Redflagdeals N Ages ago..  Since then, a lot of their drinks seemed to be served in disposable cups instead of real cups.. 

However, this incident hasn't deterred their business. Still popular and very conveniently located in a mall with many food establishment nearby, Destiny has really done well and is always busy.. no matter what time I go there.

Though this place isn't as big and luxurious comfortable as their counterpart, the one thing I like the most about this place is their game room with the big round tables on the left. side..  I think that is the only  BBT place that has decent medium to large size round tables.. I know tenren has round tables too but their ones are kind of small and can only sit 4 to 5 people..   

Too bad they updated their menu and remove their rice with minced pork and an egg for just $3.99 and instead replaced with pricier food items..

Service is ok..   Drinks are ok too but I would much prefer to go to Tenren, ChaTime or GO for tea for drinks..  Destiny is the last on my list for drinks.. but it is still passable.. 

Parking may be a little hard in the plaza during busy times.. if you don't mind walking, then park in the No Frills plaza..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and Destiny for you Markham-mites is a popular franchise known for their bubble tea, desserts and even food options.

This particularly location is close to home, so we decided to stop in for some bubble tea.  The venue from the outside looks big, but once inside it's even bigger, with a second floor and huge stage where I assume bands play on weekends.  Contemporary decor everywhere but most of all clean and presentable with plenty of cozy seating areas.

They got an extensive food menu and offer a lot of daily specials, but have never tried, perhaps will one day, but I've only tried their drinks.
Most notable I've had was their passion fruit tea with tapioca, green tea with red bean mix, mango slushy, Honey Wintermelon.  Overall a solid 3/5. 
Their prices are slightly higher, again going with the upscale ambiance."}

Drink quality 2
Cup quality 5
Environment 8 
We ordered 1 brown sugar latte and 1 hot coffee. 
When the server brought 2 drinks in 2 paper cups, the server had no idea which one is latte or coffee. I asked the server, how do we tell? He said no idea. So we were in a weird silent situation. Then he said just try it. I was speechless...

The quality and service is extremely low."}
{"text":"Many good things about this place maybe to make up for the service. 1) It's huge. 2) It has free, passwordless wireless. I'm really sick of finding small places in North York always packed to the gills with York and Seneca students and you can't get a table for a 45 minute sit down.

I had the sweet 'n' sour fried chicken strips and rice. Oh heaven. It was good. For about $8 you also got a salad and spring roll plus a bubble tea. The salad and spring roll seemed more filler. 

No weird stuffed animals in baby milk bottles for sale like Tea Shop 188. That just leaves me sad. And confused. http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Cy5VGp4Qhq6AI3Y9ukR2sA?select=3s0OsCuRC-QnlZYmLkb2Xw"}
{"text":"This is the worst place for desert. The drinks come in takeout cups and only comes in 1 size. Quality is substandard."}

Only come here if you don't have anything to do for a few hours and don't mind waiting half an hour to get a menu, and even then you'll have to wave down a server to get one.  

The place looks nice, food is not bad but the service.  Avoid this place if you are in a hurry, especially if you only have an hour or two to spare.

If I had alot of time on my hands and I was in this area I'd come here again"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location at least once a month when it first opened.  It had great bbt and a fantastic atmosphere.  I played many a games of Monopoly on its tables (how the heck do they make $$?).  I even took my parents there once, and they loved it!

That being said, I disappeared from the scene for a year and when I returned, I heard about the insect disaster.  I was crestfallen... and found the FB chatter that started it all hilarious in its spelling/grammer mistakes.  

Going back after the reno, I was terribly disappointed.  It had lots all of its previous charm and been changed into a faceless, nameless typical bbt lounge - much like their other location in highway 7.  While their selection was the same as before, you can see from the number of people around, how much difference atmosphere makes in choosing your bbt hangout.

Try again Destiny owners - this time don't change a winning formula!"}
{"text":"Meh. Came here twice with co-workers. It's a lot better than Go For Tea but some of the food is a bit overpriced. The bubble tea is really good and the desserts are really good too. I guess the main courses are a-okay. Not the greatest but service was WAY better than Go For Tea."}
{"text":"Horrible service is all i can say!

We came in for drinks and it took 15 minutes to get a server to take down our orders. 3 different servers passed by our table numerous times and just looked at us and smiled, so i finally had to ask someone to take our order and one of the server said sorry, i'l have to wait for my server! how am i suppose to know?! he/she hasn't even introduced themselves yet. I've also noticed 2 other tables beside me have been waiting for their bill and kept looking around to find a server

SO...finally! they took down our order and I was not shocked to find out that they don't have the yodully drink (yogurt drink) again. The last time i was here they didn't have it either. Take it off your menu then!

I ended up ordering the pineapple yogurt drink, the yodel drink is thinner in consistency than the yogurt drink. It was good but not great. My boyfriend ordered the Mango Mix drink and it was tasty with real mango slices but the drink itself was too sweet!!

This place needs to have better service and this place will be alright."}
{"text":"I haven't been for a few months but recently I just went back and I am sad to say I was super disappointed in this place.

First of all, I was on crutches and had to hobble to the second floor to sit at a table. Then our table is hidden behind the stage and basically the staff cannot see us unless we call them.

The food arrived pretty late. Drinks were okay nothing different in particular. The food is average, they changed the menu again and now I don't really have any foods that I do like to eat besides popcorn chicken.

To top it off there was a garbage can right behind our seat. That's pretty gross.

The bill finally came and they had charged us 15% service charge on top of tax even though we only had 6 ppl! This is ridiculous as the servers barely served us and yet we are forced to pay a service fee that is illegally enforced.

Honestly if it weren't for the vicintiy points I would not consider going back. But next time I'm gonna make sure that I have the freedom to pay the tip that I think they deserve."}
{"text":"The girl working tonight gave us the worst service possible. When we walked in asking for a table for two she misheard and thought I said 11 and gave us a rude face when she thought we were a large party. When we were making our order many of the things we wanted were sold out and we had to go through several options before the order was finalized. I ordered one of their 3 choice platters, choosing edamame, bean curd, and pig ear strips (which were clearly written on the menu as choices to choose from). When the food came I noticed that they brought me seaweed instead of the ear strips I wanted. And it wasn't like normal seaweed side dishes you would get at Japanese/Korean restaurants, it was boiled kelp. Thick ass rubbery kelp. So I told that she might've made a mistake with my order cause I didn't order \"seaweed\" and she reassures me that I did and says she'll go check the order. She comes back with the menu and the sheet of paper she wrote on and asks me to point at which one I wanted. So I point at the ear strips option and she flat out told me I was wrong. She said that those weren't offered anymore after they changed their menu and that she wrote down seaweed because she was sure I said that. So I asked if she could take the dish back and just substitute the seaweed for more edamame or bean curd but she refused to and said there's no way she can take that back because I'm the one who made the mistake. So fine, I simply just left the kelp and didn't touch it. When we asked for the bill she took 20 minutes just to get it to us even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. We turned around to look for her and saw her socializing with another table. Then she took another 10 minutes just to get us our change. I hope I don't run into her ever again."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a very rainy Wednesday evening. We came here because it had been renovated and it has been WAY too long since all of us has been together. 

This place wasn't very busy and we put in our orders for 10 people while we waited for a few more people to arrive. Drinks and food started coming in as well as the rest of our party (three of them to be exact). One drink is missing though. The late comers' orders came and one drink is still missing. We asked a server to check on the drink, 15 minutes later, still nothing. We asked another server to check on the drink, still nothing. Then another server came back to us to tell us that drink was never ordered. What?

All in all, we had about five servers helping us, none of whom knew what was going on. One of my friends also wanted to pay separately as he had to leave early, again asked someone, and they didn't understand what we wanted to do and brought us the entire bill when we weren't ready to leave yet.

Also, why don't they have coasters? Serving a cold wet drink on a piece of napkin just makes it soggy and not sure what the purpose is.

I must admit the decor is nicer, but I can't really come here again if I can help it."}
{"text":"The only good thing about Destiny is: they allow you to do work and live music on Friday nights.  Not impressed by their drinks. 

I ordered their limited time dragon fruit smoothie and it was very icy.  I can barely taste the fruit.  It definitely taste more of a slush than smoothie."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after having some noodles next door. 

Stawberry shortcake $5.99 - must have been weeks old cake. How could I tell you ask. The chocolate dipped strawberrys were shrivelled up and had moisture build up on the hardened chocolate. Tasted like weeks old cake aswell.

Cheese cake $5.99 - same as mentioned above

Large milk tea with tapioca pearls, egg pudding and grass jelly $5.99 - tasted okay but the whole experience was ruined with the cake already.

There was hardly anyone there on a Thursday night so service was fine. The whole place looks all upscale but the leather cushioned seats are all cracked and warn out. Dimly lit lighting is there to set the mood but I just found the whole place to be depressing. Destiny is just not what it use to be back in the days."}
{"text":"Love the new decor of this place! Service was attentive (it was a Tuesday night that we went so it was quiet). We ordered a honey green tea and a build-your-own-waffle. We ordered it with pineapple and strawberry with condensed milk and banana gelato. We were shocked that they used fresh pineapple. There was very little condensed milk tho. The dessert menu was very very little (waffle or crepe). They had some deserts on display at the corner of the restaurant but there was no price attached. Will prolly come back to try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Not really going to be a long review just because I'm a little biased towards this place because I've been coming here religiously for almost 7 years. The menu offers a wide range of specialty drinks, desserts and snacks/entrees. I love coming here when I have work to do or study during the day. This location now provides live music after 7pm (Chinese singers) which is a great vibe for large groups of people. The reason I gave it a 3.5 is because not all the food/ drinks are great. You really have to visit often and try a variety to see which ones that fit to your taste. The atmosphere is pretty romantic as well for those couples looking for a lazy drinks/dessert chill night out. 

Recommendations: 
House special fruit tea (cold)
Honey aloe Vera tea (cold)
New York cheesecake 
Fries 
Beef/fish balls"}
{"text":"I had a really terrible time eating here. As soon as we finished eating, they brought our bill. I understand if the restaurant is filled that you would need the seat for other customers but it's not even a quarter filled and they were rushing us out. We also were asked again to pay 10 minutes after our meal. I don't believe anybody would be comfortable eating here"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place it always seems to be an off-day where my friends and I are the only customers here.  ...which is not bad since we get our orders ridiculously fast, just a bit concerning for their business  

I definitely like their snacks/desserts/drinks a lot more than the mains.   Beware though, the waffles take 30min to make.  I recommend the gigantic tea drink that has a gazillion fruits deliciously soaked in it as well as the green tea/red bean waffles :)  It's a really good hangout place with free wifi and you can even get work done here if you don't mind the neighboring chats in Chinese lol"}

1Came here for a date. The experience started poorly when we walked in and no one was looking after seating.  I wave down a guy who reluctantly found us a seat close to the kitchen that was smelly but we moved ourselves to a better seat.

We used so much energy to flag down a server. The food came quick at least. We ordered 1) Lavender Fresh tea (picture) 2) popcorn chicken 3) pineapple ham fried rice.

The tea was the worst, it tasted like water after 10 minutes of steeping and the waitress basically said to just keep waiting but nothing happened. We talked to the manager and got it taken off our bill at least.

The popcorn chicken was mediocre and had a bone in it.

The fried rice was super bland.

But at least the food came quick.....which was the only good point.

Price - it was too expensive for the quality I received."}
{"text":"Not bad for bubble tea. Large selection of non-alcoholic drinks hot and cold, many small plates to share, snacks, and desserts. Very young crowd, and very crowded too. Somehow, I liked the old location better, but I can see the appeal of a bigger and trendier lounge. The quality of their food and drinks, and their service is just okay. What really does make me come back here is that they are open late."}
{"text":"I was a regular at this place back in high school, before the bubble tea rush. Now there are so many bubble tea joints sprouted throughout GTA, I'm glad to see Destiny had survived.
Although the interior has changed dramatically compared to its early days, the lousy customer service and abundance of teeny boppers are same as always. You'd think they will be more customer attentive now."}
{"text":"I come here as often as I can. I live only a few minutes away, and since my boyfriend and I are both restaurant workers this is one of the only places still open for us to eat together at around 12 AM when we finally get back into the city.

What I really enjoy is that they have a selection of both American and Asian dishes. So me, as a Canadian without a very refined palate, and my Chinese boyfriend, can both order something and feel satisfied.

I'm addicted to their club sandwich (which comes with a side of fries) and strawberry milkshake. It's my go to meal every time I come here. I haven't been disappointed yet. My boyfriend usually gets the red bean ice cream shake, which he finds a little too sweet *but he finds EVERYTHING too sweet* Everything tastes great, and I like their addition of an egg on my club. Actually, I think that's my favorite part! Whenever we're feeling really hungry we will order their popcorn chicken, which is just delish. I was surprised my first time trying when I realized they used cinnamon... but it was a much welcomed surprise. And when we're really feeling like overdoing it and rolling each other home, we get the strawberry short cake. I love it. It's my absolute favorite desert anywhere. I have read a review here stating their disappointment and observations that it was old, but I have not experienced that yet. It all tastes fresh to me.

The decor and atmosphere is great. The lighting and seating really sets the mood to relax and enjoy your company. And with their order/service machine we aren't being constantly interrupted. Sometimes when we aren't too tired we will order cards and gamble together to see who pays for dinner, which is always cute and fun.

The only thing I'm not a fan of is the service. You really feel like all they care about is getting your money, and getting you out. Though I have noticed this only with the floor managers. The runners/bus people always seem friendly enough and have made me feel comfortable.

There is one lady in particular who I don't look forward to encountering, usually on the weekends when it's busy. We call her 'the boob girl' because she is always wearing a low cut white blouse under a relaxed black blazer. She never really looks at you, is always walking fast so you don't feel like you want to interrupt her, and when she is giving you the bill and you pay she doesn't make eye contact, never smiles and just mumbles Xie Xie as she walks away. Seems a bit snobbish.

All in all, the quality of food is excellent in my opinion, and I will continue to come back frequently!"}
{"text":"This is one of my hangout place with my friends when we can't think of anywhere else to go and we don't want to go to far.

I come here mostly for drinks at night. The drinks here are slightly pricey but since we stay here for hours on end, it's worth the price. I would get food once and while such as crepes/cakes/popcorn chicken/snacks. I think the food here is decent. I wouldn't come here for a full meal but as far as snacks and desserts go, they do a fairly good job.

The service here is not the greatest. Sometimes the wait time for the drinks take forever and if you want water, you better ask for it the moment you're seated or else you'll never get it.

Although the venue is large, sometimes there is a crazy line to get a table on the weekends."}
{"text":"Ordered seafood platter, which is a new item to menu selection. Impressed with amount of food for $57 price point. There is another meat platter selection, which I'd love to come try again. 

No picture for the hot mixed fruit tea but we loved it! It's very sweet, which is exactly what I like (I eat timbits by multiples of 10 in one setting).

Waitress accidentally dumped a mug of hot water over the table, which was boiling hot and got onto my hand and phone. I ran to washroom to have my hand sit under cold running water, so there's no damage done. My phone also stayed safe! Phewww... she was very apologetic and came to clean up immediately. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight on a whim. My boyfriend and I were craving bubble tea. We were promptly greeted, with a smile, and sat in a lovely private booth, even though we were facing a wall. It kinda made it feel more private.

Let's talk decor for a second. The light fixtures are gorgeous. Although they still have Christmas decorations up, it really works. Very pretty. The wall we are facing is pretty bear up, but the beauty of the shadows from the light fixtures hides it. Wonderful job. The booth is very comfortable. I could sleep here!

I ordered the Sesame Ice Cream Slush. I've had Sesame Ice Cream before. This was fantastic. It tasted like peanut butter. Except more flavorful, and adding ice cream on top of a slush is genius. I got it with tapioca, which were so properly cooked it was mouth watering. I was practically drooling from over enjoyment as I enjoyed the drink.

My boyfriend got the Taro Ice Cream Slush. He really enjoyed it. He tends to be more subdued than I, so forgive me that I cannot tell you more about it. I tasted it. It was very good. Try it. Fall in love. Its OK.

All in all, I will be back. Like tomorrow. Maybe at midnight."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at this Destiny's location for about 4 years or so, way before when they had the old interior decor...and I've probably tried most of their drinks on their menu.

The drinks here are reasonably priced, you'll be surprised by the tall glasses and big cups. Highly recommend (any)ice cream slush, fruit slush, and herbal tea..especially the Logan Dried Date Tea. You cannot customize your drinks though.

Their Thai Style Seafood Fried Rice is AMAZING. Definitely a surprise since food is usually mediocre at bbt places. 

Service has improved significantly compared to when I first visited years ago. 

Live music (mainly mando songs) is now available at Destiny's at night when the place is more packed. It gets pretty loud so I dont recommend studying here. It can be  pro or con, depending on your taste in music. But all the singers have been pretty good and awesome. For me, it's definitely a nice add to this bbt place!"}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying I don't understand the big deal with bubble tea places at all. I'd rather pay $20 for a good meal than $10 for a sub-par non-alcoholic drink. Destiny's was the destination chosen by one of my friends for a Friday get-together. She had called ahead and asked to be seated upstairs which apparently had \"VIP rooms\". The person on the phone had told us that if we sat upstairs, we could play cards as well and upstairs seating meant a higher mandatory service charge. 
Fast forward to 9:00, the time of our reservation. Finding parking was nearly impossible but we caught a lucky break after circling the lot for 10 minutes. One friend was already seated upstairs, waiting for the rest of us but the hostess at the front desk repeatedly claimed no one was upstairs at all. It turns out the hostess made a mistake because our friend was indeed waiting upstairs. 
A few minutes after being seated, we ordered and our drinks arrived in plastic cups instead of the regular glass ones (probably due to the fact they didn't want to carry glasses up the stairs). A few friends ordered noodles off the menu that came in giant bowls. The verdict on the food was a positive one although I didn't order any food because the menu seemed unappetizing. I got the green tea ice cream drink which I've had before and quite liked. This time, the drink was so watered down, it became so bitter and quite honestly, too disgusting for me to finish. It was a $10 drink with tax and I ended up leaving half of it at the restaurant. The price for ice cream and water was too high. They also wouldn't let us play the deck of cards I had brought along despite telling us otherwise on the phone. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"The Nitty-Gritty:

Cash only joint, so bring those bills or you'll be left using that sketchy ATM located by the entrance.

Ten percent gratuity is automatically included in the bill. Hate the service? Too bad. 

The Experience:

Our small group arrived in the late afternoon and the lower level was about half-filled. The clientele varied between families, couples and young 20 somethings. We spent fifteen minutes perusing the huge menu before flagging down a server. Destiny's not only has all the typical and non-typical bubble tea/yogurt/ice cream/coffee drinks, but also asian snack foods and full on meals of rice and noodle dishes. For the adventurous, I even spied an offering of stinky tofu, but I personally was too wary of a *tea house* offering this to take the dive. 

Our server spoke at an absolutely lightning speed. I have the tendency to vomit out words when I'm excited, but even I was straining to hear his \"any tapioca or jelly with that?\". All in the name of efficiency I suppose. 

Not. During the 20 minute wait that followed, we spent part of it trying to guess where his accent was from. I was convinced it was Korean. I mean come on...that face, those glasses. Korean. However, a friend more well-versed in the realm of Kpop, TVB dramas, and asian things in general assured me it was a Hong Kong accent. Fascinating.

The decor of this place is nice, with dark paneling and sleek staircases leading to the upper level. I wasn't surprised to hear that once upon a time, this Destiny's location used to be a club. With the slow mix of pan-asian pop music playing in the background and low buzz of conversation around us, my companions said they felt a little sleepy as we were finishing up later on.

The Food and Drink:

The drink servings were rather large, but generous? I wouldn't say so. Destiny's varying states of liquids (fluid - slush), are all around the range of $4-$8, so on the cross comparison of size to price, the shock factor's a tinge misleading. 

I had the Red Bean Ice Cream Drink, which was nice. Icy, creamy, red bean-y. With all the variety on the drink menu, I doubt I'd try the same thing twice here. This might seem picky, but the little square napkins they used as coasters kind of bothered me. They were rather useless and would just stick to the bottom of your glass awkwardly as you lifted it up.

The Wasabi Mayo Squid Balls were actually surprisingly good. Chewy texture with a slight wasabi kick both from within and from the outer sauce, even non-spicy eaters would enjoy this. The little whole squid piece at the centre of each of these was a nice touch.

Spicy Popcorn Chicken. A nicely sized portion for sharing, you can't really go wrong with these. It's not the disappointing variety of popcorn \"chicken\" where it seems like it's more batter and mysterious bits and pieces of something that resembles meat. With every bite of the kind here, there's no doubt it's chicken - or least some closely related species. The \"spicy\" element comes into play courtesy of a dry seasoning over top. Since Destiny's also offers a non-spicy version of this, that magical reddish dust is most likely the only difference between the two. Again, on the flavor scale, I'd say only the most sensitive of tongues wouldn't be able to handle this.

The Star Killer: 

Destiny's should really come up with a lingo system for their staff, or maybe at least choose a language other than the one our party of four happened to all be fluent in. Otherwise, it just makes for an unpleasant experience to have a server run down to the front as we were leaving to ask the hostess who took our bill if the table had paid yet. The included tip in the bill had kind of already left a bad taste in our mouths considering the slow service, and this was really just the insult on the injury. We don't have supersonic hearing, but he wasn't whispering. 

The Verdict:

To sum it all up, the thought that really stayed in my mind was that Destiny's has the potential to make a reeeeeally bad first date. I can see it already. Trendy tea house, seems all well and safe...until the dark side of Destiny's comes rearing its ugly head. Awkward conversation becomes no conversation when the drinks haven't arrived for half an hour. Boy has no cash and the monster living in the ATM will swallow his credit card whole. As they leave, the server accuses them of being dine-and-dashers...if they're lucky, they won't understand what he's saying. 

Anyways, that would be the worse case scenario. 

I'm willing to give Destiny's the benefit of the doubt that this was a one time miscommunication that could have been handled more gracefully and make a return visit when the mood for squid balls strikes again. 

Besides, what other place in the city has stinky tofu *and* mango cr√™pes on the same menu?"}
{"text":"I love the kiwi slush here( made with fresh kiwi), better than go for tea( made by powder and sugar syrup)
I have been working in a place where offers bubble tea and slush, I can taste the quality of the drink within a second

However, the waffle is bad, the ice cream on the top is not creamy, I didn't get what I expected"}
{"text":"I come here often just for bbt and to chill with friends. It's a really good hangout spot at night just for a chat. 

Service is decent. They get your order and bring you your drinks. If you need assistance you can just press the help button on the table. 

Bbt and food here is averagely priced. Love and highly recommend their ice cream slush and herbal teas. 

The mango shaved ice is okay. Nothing too special... there was only mango and condensed milk on top of the shaved ice. 

I rarely order food here but last time I ordered a Thai seafood fried rice. It was surprisingly pretty good! Their seafood ramen is mediocre however pretty cheap imo ($10)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! They had the largest selection of bubble tea/specialty drinks I've ever seen on a menu - wanted to try them all! Ordered a waffle with ice cream and fresh fruit - delicious!"}
{"text":"Destiny is a cool, casual place to chill and hang with your friends after a long day thanks to their late closing times. Also, the interior has a nice feel to it. 

The servers were nice but I definitely feel that they need to improve their service. Unfortunately, we had to ask for hot water twice and ask for the bill twice and wait a bit long for them. Although, one server was able to recognize that she forgot and was sorry and quick to resolve it. I guess it all comes down to who your server is.

According to my friend, their menu and sizes has changed (this is my second time at Destiny). I ordered their limited time Dragon Fruit Smoothie with tapioca and I was kinda disappointed. The quality was lacking imo. So if you're reading this, save yourself the $8 and buy something else. Also, I tried my friend's Fried Rice and it was decent. There was no defining, savory taste like fried rice at Congee Queen or a Hakka restaurant. 

Tip: hot water is free so if you buy tea, you could basically pour the hot water in the tea to get more out of your money."}
{"text":"Whenever I go up north to visit I always make sure to stop by and visit Destiny.  First of all I love the comfy couches and the environment is chill.  It's open late which is great as well.  They serve the best condensed milk bread here.  Definitely should visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came to Destiny for the first time though did take-out on bubble tea. Just want to quickly comment that their Guava Slush is not good. It's watery and really, tastes more like water than anything else. Did enjoy the tapioca though. I tried the Mango Slush and say that it is definitely better.

Rating is purely for the Guava Drink, not the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food are too salty. They served us with a wrong drink. We will never coming back here again!"}
{"text":"UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UTNZ... I swear that's what I heard from outside 'cause inside it sure as hell looks like a well-refurbished club, but instead there were catchy korean pop songs playing. Yay... I hate catchy korean pop songs 'cause they're insanely catchy. *Frustrated* 

So yeah, this place is monstrously big in a good way. There is also free wi-fi so a lot of people had their laptops. There is also another floor, but that for people with a party of 6 or more (I'm pretty sure). Although, I'd love to grab a few of my friends JUST to sit up there, haha.

I never tried their bubble tea before... but I did have their BEEF BRISKET noodle and I tried my friend's spicy noodle? The beef brisket noodle was not pleasing to the eyes 'cause the soup base was evily dark, which didn't even taste good. Also, the beef was chewy and just dissapointing.

Had a try of my friends noodle, which smelled great and tasted better than mine with the spices.

My friend ordered a Rose Tea which comes in a pot and you get unlimited water refulls. It was only okay. I would have much preferred Jasmine tea or Green tea 'cause the rose tea tasted too perfume-like. 

Overall: I'd only come back for free wi-fi or just because it's so comfortable here. Other than that....y'no."}
{"text":"I used to always come here, and my most recent visit was disappointing..

The prices are much expensive than it already was before and the service is just bad now. 

I ordered a taro shake with tapioca and they brought it out as milk tea with tapioca but not slushed ... so they said they'd make a slush one. they bring it back but I see it sitting at the front desk for awhile until the waiter brings it to me and this time it's WITHOUT tapioca..

so she says \"do you want the tapioca on the side?\" lol like no? are you dumb? 

then I decide I don't want the drink anymore because it's been sitting around there so she takes it puts it back on the same front desk and 10 minutes later another dumb server comes by and says taro slush LOL like what ???? I cancelled it only about 10 years ago and it's been sitting in the air for awhile now lmao dumb 

go hire new workers and ones that actually speak or understand English .

btw the cups are smaller compared to the size they used to be so you pay more for what you get basically"}
{"text":"Would not recommended this place at all. It use to be good but has downgraded since. Bubble teas are overpriced and not good at all. Their matcha mix is one of the house specials/recommended items but it was disgusting. The tapiocas had an off taste and was clearly old. Workers/servers were also nonexistent- took us about 30 minutes to order and another 30 to track down a worker for the bill (it was not busy at all). My girlfriend had a weird experience in the bathroom where a worker was picking her teeth and spitting whatever she picked out on the floor (?????)."}
{"text":"This is a sentimental place to me as I've been coming here since they first opened. But I have to say, they are on the downhill right now. The quality of everything has been slowly dropping bit by bit.
The other day that i was here, I ordered a Mangoccino because it was too cold for a cold drink. I also added tapioca to my drink but when it was served, it came in a coffee cup with nothing for me to get to the tapioca. The opening in the lid was too small for tapioca to fit through at well and i ended up forgetting that there was even any tapioca in the drink until i got to the end.
What happened to the days when they actually served in mugs and glasses with spoons?"}
{"text":"I come to Destiny Tea Cafe after the cockroach incident... so I am going to review it based on how it is now..

The place is nicely decorated and it is huge. We came on a Monday early evening so the place is not busy. I do like those round booth seating, they are quite comfy and relaxing.

They did mixed up our hot tea orders.. and they never come until we ask someone to check on that.

Fellow yelper did manage to get 2 for 1 chocolate cake.. that is an extra 0.5 star for that. The cake is store bought and it is not too sweet and quite delicious.

I might come back if my friend wants to come..but Destiny Tea Cafe for sure not my usual hang out joint!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and environment. I have ordered one ice latte with tapioca, which was delicious. I will come back again"}
{"text":"There was nothing to complain about. The place was clean, big and almost empty lol. My and my friend went at a good time. Around 3pm. The food was good!! I got takoyaki... TWICE!! They are Japanese Fried Octopus Balls. Yummy. My friend got the seafood fried rice. I got this huge strawberry ice cream drink at the end and it felt like it froze my insides. But that's not their fault lol. Good experience! I wonder what it's like at night :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Destiny's a number of times, and never really had an issue with it. Had a disappointing experience last Saturday night though, where my friends and I tried to order bubble tea to go. Despite the fact they were supposed to be open until 3 AM, apparently their last call was at like 2:15 AM (seriously... 45 minutes before closing time?), since my friends and I got there at that time and were told that they weren't taking any more orders. Not impressed. We ended up going to Go For Tea instead, where they were more than happy to take our order."}
{"text":"This place is a shining example of how social media can irreparably damage the reputation of an establishment, even six years later. Pretty average all in all, but I'd say to go to the one up in Richmond Hill if you can, at least that one accepts cards."}
{"text":"I had some milkshake there. Tasted diluted, very sweet and devoid of any fruits. The atmosphere is VERY upscale though. The drinks are relatively pricey for that reason. The food is decently priced but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Okay so my friend & I decided to go here for bubble tea, however upon arrival we realized we were kind of hungry. We decided to get the Seafood Style Thai fried rice, and wow we were so happy we chose that! It tasted amazing!! 

For my drink, I got the mango ice cream drink (my favourite here), but that day it was made TOTALLY different. I wasn't satisfied. They added so much ice cubes and it was so hard to drink it. It literally felt like ice was crushed for more than half the drink (did not taste like this the past few times). 

Now for the service; hmm, let's just say it wasn't the greatest. They were super slow! However, the waiters who helped us were really kind."}
{"text":"Very consistent with the food quality and the drinks I ordered tasted great! I would definitely come again, loved the decor of the cafe. The food was not bad either."}
{"text":"This place has really deteriorated in 1) customer service 2) atmosphere 3) quality of the food. 

We went in a large group and they said every single person had to order to stay. Which is fine but the server took forever to come and take our orders. Got the order wrong twice and eventually the teas that we got were still not what we originally ordered (taro milk tea and brown milk tea - nothing crazy). They forgot tapiocas in one drink and instead of apologizing the server tried making up an excuse that there were no more, which was false because they ended up putting it in at the end. Every time the server made a mistake, they never apologized but quickly dashed away when the mistake is pointed out. 

Oh what's worse is they are cash only. 

This is a place to avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Kinda upset that when I came here with my friends, they didn't have the drink I wanted (some type of soda) nor the alternative I asked for. I ended up settling for some lychee drink, I think. 

I cannot say this enough, but I really despise places that are very poorly lit. I understand the dim lighting is to create an atmosphere and mood for this place, but how can someone enjoy themselves if they can't even see the person in front of them? The mini candles on the tables were a nice touch though, and did help illuminate the table. 

The drinks themselves are good. Pricey, but good. However, I can't say that I wouldn't be able to get them anywhere else (since there are tons of Asian tea places nowadays). 

Service was awful. They took forever to come around, forever to give us our bills, and gave the wrong change to my friend. Even with multiple people helping us, it was very messy. It wasn't very busy this time of night either, so I don't understand why they took so long to help us. 

The only highlight to this place was the fact that they had a live singer performing when I was there. She was great!"}
{"text":"Here for lunch. Very horrible service. First off we ordered the chicken tender with honey sauce. Hoping it will look like how it looks like in the full bbt menu.  But no Absolutely not. Came out completely different. Even though it's exactly the same as in the menu.  Please see my pictures. It's pretty deceiving and false advertising it also taste worse than Manchu wok.

We ordered our food at the same time as all my other friends but even when we were done eating completely the 2 other dishes have still not come out.  Btw over an hour later. We mentioned to the staff several times he keeps saying we cook in order of when you placed an order whih clearly don't make sense as we ordered at same time.  He keeps becoming very defensive saying we are not the only people in this place. 

We told the staff we ordered at the same time. Actually the missing dish was the first to place the order. He just stomped off. 25 mins go buy and only one dish came out.  This is live right now.  Really ridiculous.  We have a full table right now full and finished and 1 person eating and other Person still waiting for her food.  1 and half hours after we ordered.   

Food is not worth the price as it is. Let alone the horrible service."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick snack or dinner... or just bubble tea! 

Came here with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night - it was not busy at all. 

I was craving popcorn chicken. I got the popcorn chicken combo, which came with a soup and cold dish - 12.95. 
The soup was loaded with fish balls, fish cakes and a beef ball. It was a miso soup base with bonito flakes. The cold dish was edamame beans. And the main dish came with stirred veggies, a base of rice and half chicken. It was very well portioned as you can see on my photo. 

Will come back again for their snacks/bubble tea options. 

PS. The washrooms could use a good cleaning..."}
{"text":"Destiny has been my favourite dessert place, since a friend brought me here back in 2011. 

They have a wide array of desserts, drinks and even food on their menu. You could come here for all three, or just one after a night out with friends. Possibility is endless really. 

I really like this location over the East beaver creek location. It is much more modern and aesthetically appealing. The service here also seems a lot quicker (probably because it's smaller). 

My favourite menu item is bubble tea (duh) and the strawberry blueberry waffle! An absolute must try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about Destiny besides it being a huge place.

Not sure if they're trying to save on their hydro bill or the place is just huge. It was pretty cold inside that me and my boyfriend had to keep our jackets on. Now how can you enjoy a cold bubble tea when it's already cold inside?

I've heard a lot of people hyping up Destiny's yummy bubble tea. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary and I could order the same thing else where. It was quite pricey for a small bubble tea. 

Service was lacking that we had to go up to the counter and ask for our bill.

Overall, a mediocre bubble tea experience at Destiny. I'll just stick to the bubble tea that is conveniently close to my house."}
