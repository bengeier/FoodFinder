{"text":"Service is great but the noodles is not what I've expected. From my personal opinion, dry noodle actually tasted better than soup noodle. 

I showed the noodle pictures to my friend living in Mainland China and he said they are not authentic Wuhan noodles. Feeling a bit disappointing!"}
{"text":"Seven of us ordered this through A food delivery app as we had a meeting nearby and didn't want to lose time going out for lunch. The heat level was higher than most of them expected. People who ordered medium spicy were dying. If you don't normally like suicide wings, stick to mild. I ordered the very spicy dry rice noodle which was delicious. I've never had better dry noodles. I will order medium spicy when I go back because the noodles are worth driving from midtown to Markham for. I have not been able to stop thinking of these noodles. They were tasty and the pickled radish and long green beans cut up on them were tasty."}
{"text":"Random searched on Yelp and found this restaurant. The pictures of the restaurant attracted me to pay a visit. This is not a big restaurant. Only a few tables. The restaurant mainly serves Wuhan noodles. When I looked at the menu, most of the noodles were spicy and I was afraid to pick anything. When I ordered the noodles, the chef was kind enough to put the chilli sauce on the side. So I ordered a bowl of beef noodles with think noodles. The sauce is at the bottom, half of it is sesame sauce and the other half is the house sauce. The chef advised me to mix the noodles and the sauce together first before I started to eat. As I had my first bite, wonders happened. The noodles were so smooth, with the sauce together, I felt like eating rice noodles, one of my favourite snacks on the street. The beef was nicely marinated. Its taste blended perfectly with the noodles and the sauce. It's so delicious !!"}
{"text":"It's a small place and have a few tables with 2 workers.  Menu is small which is good. The price is average but I found the bowl is smaller. It also come with a pop with my noodle. Overall, I think this place is average but if you live in those condo around then it's good to just come down the floor without driving."}
{"text":"Being a wuhanese I would rate them 8/10 for the the noodle, always go there. Can't compare to the one from hometown but better than the instant noodle from T&T lol... Recommend their doupi too. 
Didn't really like the soup but other than that thank you for remind me of my hometown fav breakfast~"}
{"text":"This place is a small little restaurant in the HSBC plaza. It is right across from the green grotto. The restaurant is very cozy and the service is friendly. Overall, it was a good experience.

The lotus root was fresh and tasty, but be careful of the spice. My partner didn't like the spice as it was too strong

The spareribs and lotus soup was fantastic"}
{"text":"I went with a friend after another place nearby was busy. There was one other table when we got there about 130 pm but it started to become busier as we sat. They served noodles with a choice of dry or with soup plus a variety of meat. The prices were average but the place is not fancy at all. 

The staff were friendly and explained some of the menu. We ordered a soup noodle with beef and a dry noodle with chicken. They were better than I expected. The side order of cucumbers were really good and it was a decent size. The noodle orders also included a pop with them. 

Overall, it feels more like a family run business and it is for quick bites although we stayed to chat for a while without being rushed. We also got some hot tea from the owner."}
{"text":"Wuhan Noodle 1950 opened up a relatively new location in Markham in the same plaza as Gal Sushi. The restaurant is quite small, clean, and seats up to 18 people in the whole place. 

Wuhan specializes in hot dry egg noodles, some exotic sounding meats (like chicken gristle, duck feet, duck heart, duck head), and as well as some other noodle soups. Rice noodles are also available. The sizeable portion of noodles is served with a small amount of sauce at the bottom of the bowl. The sauce is a blend of sesame paste, hot chili oil, green onions, cilantro and small amounts of vegetables that you mix your dry noodles into to coat them. 

I ordered the beef dry noodles and hubby ordered the chicken dry noodles. I found my beef slices to be somewhat dry in consistency. The chicken looked less dry as it consisted of pieces of dark meat. The noodles were flavourful but the sesame paste was a bit thick and it helped to have hot water to wash the noodles down. I would have appreciated something like pickled vegetables to have on the side, but perhaps that is not in keeping with the regional cuisine.

The level of spice can be customized. Be warned that if you have a low tolerance to spice like me, you may be best to go with no spice! My mouth was burning as I ate most of my bowl of \"mild\" dry noodles! One of the staff told me that these types of dry hot noodles are traditionally served with vinegar as a condiment, which actually helped to balance out the heat in the dish. Service staff were friendly and attentive.

All in all, for the two noodle dishes, our bill came out to about $23. A little pricey for noodles in my opinion. They have even more expensive dishes, such as noodles with crab ($15), which might be interesting to try. I would likely return to try their beef noodle soup and \"spiced flammulina velutipes\" (which is a fancy way of saying spiced enoki mushrooms)."}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm just really hungry but this place really hits the spot. Came here on my lunch break after my coworker suggested it. Parking here is kind of a nightmare and I was a little skeptical at first since the English menu isn't very detailed and a little hard to understand. I ordered the beef dry noodle as per the cashiers recommendation - she was very patient with me asking her lots of questions so I could get an idea of what to expect. 
The sauce at the bottom compliments the beef and the green onions and picked beans go so well with the noodles and sauce. My meal came with a canned pop which made $9.99 really worth it. Definitely gonna come back more often on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Their dry noodles contain special sesame paste, cilantro, green onion, sour green bean and dried radish. You have to mix the noodles and the sauce. Very tasty! I like cilantro. You could ask server to omit if you are not into cilantro. 

 dry noodles comes with pop, for $9.99. 

Three delicacies wrapped in tofu skin is sticky rice with minced mushroom, dried radish wrapped in tofu skin. Something different. 

Small place--could only seat 18 people."}
{"text":"a pretty small and cozy place with nice workers and delicious noodles. the food also came pretty fast which was good and it comes with a can of free pop which is even more amazing and free wifi! ordered the traditional wuhan dried noodle and u can adjust the spiciness, i asked for super little spicy but it was still pretty spicy. mayb next time i'll ask for the spicy sauce on the side. 

def a good lunch spot or a little afternoon snack but i don't think this will fill me up for a dinner meal. overall amazing food and amazing experience and i will for sure come back. :)"}
{"text":"A taste of Wuhan's hot dry noodle instantly bought me back to my childhood.  I remember eating these hot dry noodle growing up in Wuhan.  Years have gone by and I completely forgotten about this dish until a friend told me about Wuhan Noodle 1950.  For those that aren't as familiar with hot dry noodles, think of it lo mein but 10x tastier! The unique blend of sauces with pickled veggies on egg noodles makes this dish one of the best I've had this year.  I ordered the chicken hot dry noodles but could probably done with it the chicken.  Just plains noodles already hit the spot.  The hubby ordered the beef noodle soup which I didn't like.  I found the broth to be a bit on the sour side. 

The only one complaint I have is how thirsty I was after the meal but that won't deter me from coming back."}
