{"text":"Great place to hang out - great food and drinks. Shout out to Mary who is the best waitress there!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to grab a few drinks and some food.  The location is ideal.  I really love their self service beer wall, since they always have new beers on tap, I like to pour 1/2 glasses so I can try them all!"}
{"text":"Save yourself from the foam of the beer garden self pour stations. Beer comes out way to quick. Good concept, bad execution."}
{"text":"The good part : nice place to sit on the patio when it is not over 90 degrees and drink beer. The bad part : Food is lame, service minimal, and every thing overpriced. 
Several better options a short walk from here."}
{"text":"Mary the server was absolutely incredible!!!  I have never met a serve so incredibly optimistic! She helped us pick our food our beer, everything! The manager was awful . Mathew was soooo rude :(  he wasn't supportive of his staff,customers, or really the company as a whole. It was sad:(  he even questioned his own employees which was so sad bc Mary was soooo awesome"}
{"text":"Just don't even bother.

Arrived at 5:30pm with a friend, and decided to sit in the patio because the weather was nice and the patio was empty. We wait for 15-20 mins and the waiter asks us if we wanted to order. We order our beer and an appetizer, and 10 mins later my friend gets hers and I get my taster. I ordered my actual beer, and then another 15 mins my beer comes and the waiter says, \"on the house because we took so long.\" Cool, right?! 

Finally 6:20 rolls around and we should have food by now, right? Wrong! We ask the waiter about it. He says, \"Oh, I'll go check on it!\" But I mention that he didn't ask what flavor of wings we wanted, then he says, \"I'm not gonna lie, I didn't enter it in.\" WOW! So he lied to my face. He says sorry, but you know it's the fake sorry. Waiter of 19 years old doesn't care. Then I mention I want to talk to a manager, and he says ok. 

A lady at the bar then proceeds to tell me that the manager acted completely rude to her, but also didn't really care what she or other patrons had to say about the service. We saw several customers leaving who were waiting on just drinks. 

Talk about horrible customer service.  

I experienced this the first time I was here but figured it was because they had just opened up (this was 2 weeks after their opening). This is now MONTHS after they opened and the service is still horrendous. They were completely dead when we arrived so there wasn't a reason for the slow or inattentive service. 

If I could give them a negative review I would. I've never experienced service this bad."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my experience here. Service was awful and food was extremely poor. It was Final Four weekend so you are probably thinking cut them some slack. It was dead. Apparently it was the Oregon bar but very lightly attended so service should have been great. Lazy servers that were not focused - distracted with conversations with friends vs taking care of customers. Took 45 minutes to get food.  Had pulled pork. Ridiculously dry, old bun, no sauce.  Overpriced as well but understand they are trying to take advantage of Final Four weekend.  Like the concept of food truck for menu but poorly executed. I will not be back.  Gave 2 stars only since server recognized poor service and comped food."}
{"text":"Most unapologetically bad  service from waitress (Dee) and manager ever. Would take pages to describe how many things went wrong. What food we actually got after waiting an hour and everything getting messed up was ok but cold amd missing sauces, napkins and utensils among other things."}
{"text":"While this place has a great concept it is an absolute shit show. Terrible wait staff, clueless management. I ordered what I thought was a warm lobster roll and what came out was cold and had coleslaw (not detailed on the menu). When I pushed back the waitress tried to get the chef to explain the recipe to me I told her that I wanted something else. She then came back and asked if I wanted it warmed up. I said no and told her what I wanted to eat. 

When it came to pay the bill we asked for split checks and she said she would just take our cards and be back with our receipts. I was not shocked when she ran my card on someone else's bill. When I told the manager about it he seemed very disinterested. Hell, the waitstaff didn't even know about their Cinco De Mayo specials. 

Might be a good place for a drink but it was horrible for lunch."}
{"text":"Cool hang out, 4 stars because I haven't tried the food yet but the beers and atmosphere are awesome. Great concept I initially thought oh we are about to spend some serious change here. Me and my girlfriend went with some friends I'm a 2 and done beer drinking maybe 3 if I'm feeling frisky, but my girlfriend can throw them back. So to my joy I was completely shocked at the bill we had about 5 or 6 glasses of beer, and it didn't put a dent in our wallets. We will definitely be back with more friends."}
{"text":"The drinks were okay, the beer was good. What made this place five star worthy were Zach and Bethany. I have never had someone so excited about helping me find the right beer or helping me out in general. They were both incredible. I would definitely recommend The Park... Especially if you get one of them!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and idea are great. Our food was awful. We ordered chicken strips, fish tacos and calamari. The calamari had a horrible odor and was  like rubber. The chicken was also a disaster. I don't know how you mess up chicken fingers but they were dry and chewy. The beer and milkshakes were great."}
{"text":"The Park was not prepared to handle the large crowds of people for the D'Backs wildcard playoff game. One bartender trying to wait on at least 30 customers sitting or standing at the bar, really c'mon man. Several taps were not available and every other customer continued to ask and be told more kegs were coming. Needless to say my girlfriend practically stood on her chair to get the bartenders attention. The bartender had patience for the anxious crowd and that's respectable. Sure glad we decided not to go back after the game. I'm sure it was 10x busier than before the game. In summary, waiting 15 minutes to get two beers felt like a lifetime. The management is the blame for the insufficient staffing and empty beer taps."}
{"text":"First off when you walk in it's not clear if you wait to be seated or if you seat yourself. After being told to find our own seat we waited to be greeted by a server. After a while we decided to go up to the bar to order our food and drinks. We were then told to go back to our table and someone would come by, after quite some time our server finally came. The place wasn't very busy but all the staff seemed overwhelmed. We ordered 2 IPA's, calamari and the spinach artichoke dip. The calamari portion was a joke and when we complained our server said she normally discourages those interested in ordering it. There were 6 small pieces for $11. Our bill including tip was $48.00, which is obsurd for what we ordered. We asked prior to ordering if they have a happy hour and one waitress didn't know and the other reluctantly told us they hadn't had it recently because of all the events going on. Your telling me you cut off your happy hour because it's busy!? That makes no sense. This place lives up to its bad reviews."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work and happened to ask a couple of locals where to have a good beer, burger, and watch the games. They pointed me to The Park. It was not a let down in the least. The wait staff, especially Alissa was amazing! Alissa made each visit great (we went there each night of our 3 night trip). The burger (The Park burger) was juicy and full of flavor! At night the local college crowd came out, which made it fun as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and I love the self serve beer idea. Waiters and bartenders are always so nice."}
{"text":"Was almost dissuaded from making the trip downtown to try out the park. Had heard good things from friends but the online reviews are really unsavory. 
Decided to wait until we had a weekday to visit. Try to avoid the crowds said to be present during the weekend. Monday we walked in around 4pm to find one other person sitting in the restaurant. We decided the bar would be our best chance at better service since we'd be stationed right in front of the only employee there.
She was very kind and attentive. There weren't any other patrons there in need of service so we lucked out with the attention. Ordered fries and spinach dip, both were delivered to us within 10 mins. Very tasty and a good serving of each. Enough for two to share. With the happy hour pricing they were affordable. At off hours I'd feel it was a bit high. 
Also, notable that the menu charges extra for vegetarian changes, which perturbed me. If I'm subbing a veggie patty for my beef patty you should be charging less, not more, in my opinion.
All in all a very nice visit. Although I expect being the only patrons had something to do with it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Rude staff. Brought us the wrong food. Some of it never made it. Took the waitress 30 minutes to get us one drink. We asked for our bill and it never came. Tried to pay and she told us to hang on and disappeared for the rest of the night so we walked out. Way understaffed and poor management. You would think they just opened. I'll never go back there again."}
{"text":"Weird vibe at this place. It's been pretty much empty every time we come here. The self-serve beer pours always come out with a ton of head. Unless this place ups its game with either more trendy food or a better beer list (it only has about 16 beers, and all are light beers), I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"Great place if you don't want to get served.  We've been waiting at the bar for half an hour and can't get a bartender to pay attention.  I'll go to a bar with better service!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer*******SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND DONT GO HERE!!! 

This place seemed like a great fit but we were doomed from the start! After waiting hours to get my drink I decided to walk up to one of the bars where multiple employees were making drinks and asked for a beer which they replied you can't get one here ( taps were all flowing with beer and bottles in the fridge) strike 1. After placing and waiting more than 30 minutes for my beer I asked our waiter how our drinks were coming...... Waiter tells me oh hey we are out of the beer you wanted... Unbelievable, waited 30 minutes for him to tell me this...STRIKE 2. Just when I though this place could not get any worse they surprised me and guess what still bad. After waiting a total of 1 hour for my chicken strips I then asked the waiter how my food was coming along.... He gave me a surprised look and the dude completely forgot to input all of our food... Is this for real STRIKE 3 YOUR OUT. This place need to be put on bar rescue ASAP and have the British dude come in and start making things right. A 1 Star rating is a curtesy, if there was an option for negative I would have out -5 Stars."}
{"text":"Fabulous burger and fries. Service fantastic. Wish I'd found it sooner. In town for Origami Owl convention from Florida."}
{"text":"Bummer, such a great atmosphere and menu is good but the service is terrible. Who wants to spend time where they don't acknowledge you especially when there's hardly anyone there. Took 10 minutes to get seated when I count only 5 customers and tables galore. I don't tell anyone about this restaurant , because I would look like the idiot for referring them to a place they don't get served."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited forever for our food and our waitress was non existent. Then while we were playing games our waitress threw away a full beer of ours. This used to be a cool place but it's gone way downhill. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here after First Friday with my mom who just moved to the valley. I loved this place the first time I came, now I hate it. We sat down and granted it was busy because it was he first post season game for the DBacks which was cool because I was going to watch the end of the game. Open seating like always, but who the hell was our server?! NO ONE KNEW!!!! After sitting for a while I was told by a lady that they were looking for a server for us. I looked over at the bar to see one see pointing at us and talking with 2 other servers and he kept pointing. At this moment stop pointing and just freaking take our order!!! Another server started to clean a table next to us picks up 3 glasses walks past us and say we will be right with you...is it really that hard to take a freaking drink order, COME ON!!!!! Finally some one out of the group of servers comes and apologizes saying that they have no idea who our server is and that she will help us. THANK GOD!! She says we have an amazing beer wall, sells us on that and finishes with I will be right back with waters. She comes back with the waters and I ask for 3 passes to the beer wall, her response...\"I'm off, you're server will be right with you.\" WTF?!?!?! You just told us you don't know who our server is, so instead of taking our order starting the tab and handing it off, this awesome server leaves and makes us wait for \"our server\". There was a manager lady that had permanent bitch smile standing behind us and another dude playing with himself over by the back of he restaurant not helping serve the busy floor or finding our ghosted server. Who the hell is running this place?? Needless to say without spending a dime we got up and left thanks for ruining an awesome night out.

This place is cool a little unorthodox but has AWESOME potential, get someone in there who knows what the hell they're doing or you're going to be gone in a quick second. It's easy to make first time money but if you don't have returning money you'll be f***ed in the off season of the surrounding sports facilities. It's just like most of your reviews saying they came here a second time and won't be back for a third."}
{"text":"Great service and a good time. Rico was on point! The street tacos were delicious and so was the beer."}
{"text":"This place is an over priced hole! Bathroom overflowing and smells like a sewer! Almost a lake to use it. Asked manager about it and he stated he's not a plumber has no clue. Asked how do employees wash hands if they can't even get to sinks in restrooms because of flooding and had no clue. Lol. Will complain to health inspectors!"}
{"text":"Great new place downtown!  Tons of beer choices.  Great variety of food.  The fries (frites) are amazing!  Perfect weather tonight to sit on the patio next to the outdoor bar."}
{"text":"I tried this place out last night and took a seat at the bar. The place looked cool.  Service was fine but it felt like everyone was just going through the motions. I ordered a draft beer that came in a plastic solo cup.  I wasn't hungry but checked out the menu. Nothing jumped out at me, just the normal, standard fare that you see everywhere else. When I got my bill, I was stunned that it was for $9, not including a tip! For one plastic cup of barely cold beer.  I work in the downtown area, in the hospitality business and want the new places to be successful. However, $9 for one cup of beer is not for me.  I walked next door to The Whining Pig, ordered the same beer. It was cold, in a frosty pint glass and I paid $6.50 that included a 20% tip.  You do the math."}
{"text":"This place looked nice with the beer wall and the decor however that's all that was nice. Worse service I've ever received.  We spent almost an hour waiting for our appetizers only to find out they forgot to put the order in. (The waiter lied and said the kitchen was backed up, but when was asked a few more questions he fessed up to forgetting to put the order in)  Tables around us waited forever for service only to leave disappointed because nobody ever came over to acknowledge them.  When we asked to speak to a manager, they never came.  I guess it's a good business practice to just ignore customers.. because if you don't talk to them you don't have to deal with the issue.  If I could give negative stars I would"}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to a place for the first time, and within 60 seconds you knew you made a mistake?  Yesterday, we went to try out The Park.  We walk in and the place is empty, we go up to the hostess and joke \"I hope you can find us a seat\"  The hostess just stood there, slack jawed and bored, then said \"Follow me\", and shuffled us to our seats.  Within 5 seconds of sitting down, the waitress came and asked us what we wanted to drink, I told her, that we literally just sat down, and haven't even opened the drink menu.  So, she came back with water, my girlfriend asked if they had any chardonnay, and the waitress just blankly said, \"maybe\" and left it at that.  I asked what kind of beer they had on tap, since it wasn't in the drink menu, the waitress said \"look at the taps, that is what we have\", now mind you, the taps were a good 30 feet away and there was a lot of sun coming through the windows.  I told her that, as the taps were far away, I couldn't make out what was written on them, did she want me to get up and go look at them closer?   After many seconds of silence from the waitress (at no time did she disclose what they had on tap), I made a guess, ordered a beer.  That pretty much ended our desire to eat anything.  We finished our drinks and left, never to return. Terrible service from incompetent and uncaring staff.  There is a happy ending, we went somewhere else, where we told our story to the fantastic staff who were amazed at how terrible The Park was.

If you want to be treated by unprofessional, lackadaisical staff who really don't give a damn, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Yes the review can be very picky but my experience was amazing. I went in with a friend around 2pm and our server was amazing (Erin) I hope. The self pour taps where awesome. People who walk in please don't hesitate to ask your server for help there all great people when it comes to pouring your own beer. Food was great the ping pong table and other games where a good add on. Anyone who decides to make it out her before a game. Or any time give it a try you won't be Disappointed"}
{"text":"This place needs to figure what it is. Everything is just ok. Nothing is great about it. Please fix the self pour beer and at least print out some menus. Service staff seems to be used to apologizing all day. Food takes forever and it's usually cold."}
{"text":"Bartenders are very attentive. Food is good. Had the mozzarella planks they were yummy. Beautiful day to sit outside. Great location."}
{"text":"We will return to The Park for dinner because of the efficiency of the wait staff and delicious food.  The four of us gals decided to eat at The Park before going to a concert at 7:30 at The Talking Stick Arena.  Our reservation was at 5:30 which gave us plenty of time to dine before the show. I had the Satay Steak Skewers on Asian Slaw.  The steak was tender and spiced just right with cool, refreshing slaw.  I had a glowing drink called Heart Of The Ocean.  I loved the radiant blue tone of my martini's ice cube.
The Park offers a large variety of food such as Asian, Mexican,and American.  There's meat, low carb, vegetarian and seafood.  The Park had shown its popularity because the place was packed by the time we left to go to the concert."}
{"text":"This place is fun. Good music and family friendly in the day time. Food was delicious and portions are huge. The kids portions were huge too! Everything tasted good. Reminds me of something that would be in San Diego. Definitely coming back and checking this place out for a night out as well."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open and was not impressed when I finally went. When we walked in there was nobody around, we had to find someone to help us and the place was empty. Self pour beers came out with a lot of head and you are charged no matter what by the ounce. The beer selection needs to be improved. May as well call it downtown pedal haus."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Walked in on a Saturday night at 5pm. There wasn't a single person sitting at a table and about 5/6 people at the bar. It was clean and seemed like a good spot for drinks and dinner. Our waiter, Carlos, was clearly new but was very nice. Our waiter was with the manager, I think because we had a party of 9, I think his name was Charles/ Charlie. I asked the manager for a drink menu and he proceed to tell me to turn around and look behind me at the bar to see what was on tap. I told him I already did that but couldn't see that far. He said we could go look at the self pour beer wall and started to name the beers on tap that he could see from the back wall. It was very rude and unprofessional. After we all ordered or drinks, the manager forgot about my drink. A different waitress came over and took my drink order after everyone finished their drinks. They wait staff was EXTREMELY slow. We then put out order in with the waiter, Carlos. I ordered the cowboy burger with a side salad split with my boyfriend and he wanted a side salad as well and the burger with no BBQ sauce. We were never asked how we wanted our burger cooked. We waiting 50 minutes in an empty restaurant for or food.  After getting our food, they forgot someone in our group. They also forgot our side salad and put BBQ on our burger. We sent it back stating we asked for no BBQ sauce. Carlos was very nice and apologized. He came back with our food only to find they took the onion straws off and put new ones on and yet there was still BBQ all over the burger and the plate. They couldn't even take the time to fix the mistake, they were lazy. This was finally enough from the terrible, lazy, inconsiderate service we already received. We sent the food back and said take it off the bill because that was ridiculous. Carlos apologized and took if off. At this time a large group came in from a bar crawl and started jumping all over the stage, throwing inflatable beach balls, and turned the music up so loud we couldn't hear each other at all. They acted like they ran the place. This didn't come to a surprise from how terrible our service was. By the time everyone finished eating we were still waiting for someone in our group to get their food. Once we did we all asked for check. We waited 20 minutes to just get our check. We waiting another 15 for them to return at that time the manager came bye to ask how everything was.... we told him how terrible everything was and he didn't seem to care. He said sorry and left. We finally were able to leave and we told the manager how awful our experience was and we would NEVER come back. He said sorry and said he had no idea we didn't even eat cause we sent our food back. This guy is not management material. This place is a waste of time. Do not come here and expect good service, good food, or a good atmosphere. This is probably the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Just left The Park for their Dueling Pianos night. When I heard about the event a few weeks ago, I RSVP-ed right away via an online form that was available. The form stated that I'd be contacted right away to confirm. After a week went by and I still did not get a confirmation, I tried RSVPing again via text (another option that was available to which I did not hear back. After countless phone calls and voicemails left, I finally did hear back when I tried my final attempt of emailing the establishment. The email said the Dueling Pianos started at 7 p.m. (as did the advertisement on their Facebook page) and my dinner reservation was confirmed for 6:30 p.m. that evening (October 14th). My date and I arrived at 6:30 to which we found a table right away. The waitress seemed slightly annoyed when we ordered drinks to start and said we would wait for the show to start for our food. Our waitress came by about 15 minutes later and yet again was seemingly annoyed that we didn't place a (food) order yet. A little after 7 p.m., we found out the show wasn't starting until 8 which was a bit discouraging. We ordered our appetizer and dinner to which they came out at the same time (usually one would think the appetizer would come first with some time in between until the main course). After we received our dinner by someone who wasn't our waitress, we rarely saw our waitress the entire night. She wasn't attentive whatsoever and also took our appetizer away before we were finished. In addition, while waiting for the show to start, we noticed that there are typos on multiple ads on The Park's Facebook page which just shows poor professionalism. 

When the Dueling Pianos finally started at about 8 p.m., we were relieved yet apprehensive. The show ended up being great and the two musicians were fantastic. Their personalities and ability to improv was so great! 

All in all...

-Food: Great 
-Drinks: Great
-Atmosphere: Great
-Service: Poor
-Communication: Poor
-Advertisement: Poor"}
{"text":"I should have trusted my fellow Yelpers more...
We dropped in for some food & drinks after a match at the Chase Field. Beautiful restaurant. Really great layout. Different floor levels create very nice (almost intimate) seating. Nice concept for self service beers on tap.
Very very bad service by unprofessional people. List is too long, however my last image is five of us seated around a table of four, completely covered with finished dishes and us not succeeding in finding a place to sign our checks between the dirty dishes...
Be careful to finish whatever $ you have on their card, because the card goes to a $0 balance after a number of hours."}
{"text":"Have to give a shout out to Matthew Kincaid and The Park Craft Beer Garden.  As a business owner myself I love to give praise to another business that does a fantastic job. From start to finish Matthew took care of our group and made our business team building event spectacular. Highly recommend The Park Craft Beer Garden for any business event, or just to kick back and enjoy a pint."}
{"text":"Ordered a lobster roll that came on a stale hot dog bun with some sort of seafood salad and 4 taro chips. $19 for that. Terrible service, $8 beer, the only cool thing is the concept for having a beer. Otherwise, bad food, bad service, overpriced beer."}
{"text":"Went opening week & the team was still figuring out the drinks which is to be expected when first opening. We didn't try the food but the tacos & nachos will be had on my next trip. They looked really good & the gentlemen next to me woofed them down happily & said they were great. The place has a fun open vibe & different ways to get your beers, drinks & nosh. You can get service if you get a seat at the bar. You can do a more self serve speedy deal if you order from the counter. You can grab your own beer from the taps along the wall. Which is fun too. I'm looking forward to returning after the kinks are worked out & the public figures out how it works. Should be fun for groups going to sporting functions downtown."}
{"text":"Came here during the WWE event. My whole experience felt like maybe I'm on some sick hidden camera show. Don't let the flashy TV menus fool you. The food was way overpriced for the quality and size. The tacos are barely big enough to feed a small child. I literally witness a tiny 5 year old look pissed off because he couldn't bite the taco he was given. It was a epic battle of child versus taco, the taco won the battle. When I got mine I had no success against the taco as well. The tortilla was like someone started to heat it up, then changed their mind. Tossed it to the side, Dusted it off then placed a pinch of questionable meat on it. The texture was like a hybrid of rubber and stale tortilla.  The wings and poutine fries were no better. They were extremely salty. It's like they had salt that was about to expire and the head chef told everyone to toss it all in the food.  The head chef made it a point to express that all his ingredients and recipes are from famous cooks.  That may be true. But one time I bought a cook book by Gordon Ramsay. Even though I stuck to the book and ingredients, my wife banned me to cook anything but eggs.  Honestly if you're there for the food. Save your money. The only good thing is that it's a nice photo op for Instagram. These elite reviewers giving 5 stars, raving how great the place is, look to be people they personal know, work there or were comped to eat there for their great reviews."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch with friends from work and had a horrible experience. I ordered the grand nachos and the bbq burger....It took 30 minutes for the nachos to come out and when they finally arrived they were very bland. I think someone might have run to frys to get can cheese and threw it all over the chips. My burger was overcooked, bun was cold, and had no flavor. 

This place has soooo much potential. The atmosphere is actually cool but the service and food is trash. I wish I could get my 28 dollars back....."}
{"text":"I look forward to visiting again after kinks worked out. Ordered Hatch Green Chili pork Burrito...no green chili, weird. It reminded me of a Tina's Burrito -  Served with semi fried chewy chips, eh...no salsa??? Weird. Have to stand in two separate lines, one for food, one for drinks....then they give you a little buzzer you seat yourself & when your food comes out, the server runs around all over searching for your numbered flashing buzzer. Super weird. So my food is below warm by the time it gets to me. That is a TERRIBLE system. I order green chili cuz that's MY specialty & I haven't come across any restaurant that can compare, and I'm not just saying that. (I know). Anyway, of course parking is a pain & getting worse, not restaurant fault but when you choose a location , that's all you.  The idea is cool, execution missing on many levels. Hope on next visit things are better. Altho I know u can't control the parking."}
{"text":"We came before a Suns game. The place had a good enough vibe and we were seated fairly quickly. We were told about their self-serve beer, another cool feature. We ordered an appetizer and went up to get our beers. From there, things turned. After leaving the table to get the card set up and get our beers, which took about 3 minutes, we returned to our table to realize that it had already been given away to somebody else. We were given another table in a less desirable location but I was willing to overlook that. 
I asked to make sure that the appetizer we ordered at 
 and I assumed that would be the end of that. It was not. After waiting about 20 minutes without a visit from our server, she returned to ask if we had gotten our food yet. There was no plate at the table, full, empty, or in between, so I don't know what kind of a question that was but again, not a big deal so it was fine. 
Another 20 minutes pass, and our server comes back and says she's notified her supervisor and that it should be up next and that she's sorry. Another 10 minutes pass and the food comes out. It's almost an hour later now and  20 minutes before the basketball game but whatever. I start to eat, and wouldn't you know it, the food was cold and the juices had settled as if it'd been sitting a long time. 
I'm normally not one to send food back, but I had to in this instance. This was a ridiculous experience and it's doubtful I'll make a return trip. Can't say I place the blame on any one person as the people we interacted with seemed like they were trying, but it seemed like more of an organizational failure. Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"We will not return. On our way to a DBacks game our group thought this would be an easy, fun spot to grab lunch. They were not appropriately staffed. The hostess stepped in as a server, and bussed the tables. 30mins after seating us, the hostess returned to ask if we ordered. After another 30mins we got our food. No one once offered waters(which we had to ask for). The food was terrible, it seemed like the cook put it together last minute, fries were over salted and cold. Burgers were over cooked. Really disappointed. I created a yelp account just to review this experience so others know what to expect when dining here. 

I don't ever tip bad, but this one was special."}
{"text":"Tried to grab a bite before the Suns game.  It was crowded but we didn't have too wait to get seated.   However the service was terrible.   No one come for 15 minutes.  We went to the bar to get our drinks, kept getting ignored.  We left my husband was very mad.  The kid out front handing out coupons had the nerve to yell back at us.  Never Again.  Went to Hard Rock. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly fast service. Nice atmosphere. A favorite for us now. Huge salad portion. Price reflects quality"}
{"text":"We really really really wanted to love this place. We were following it on Facebook and were so excited. We went about 3 weeks after opening. In that time, is seems the original concept didn't quite work with the guest food truck chefs. So they created a more permanent menu which is fine but not quite as fun. They have set up 2 bars and a self serve \"beer garden\" as well as tables and some games in the back like air hockey and Jenga. The atmosphere we love, the huge trees and open feel to the place is great. Service has also been good. The food is what is meh. We have had nachos, sandwiches, tacos, etc. The grilled cheese is the only thing we liked and would get again. Drinks were decently prices. With several options for pre game bar food and drinks, this isn't our top pick for food but is for atmosphere. I hope they keep reworking the food and get it amazing because the concept  is awesome."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for this place.   The place was dead.  We were there an hour and no other customers came in.  We had really mediocre spinach artichoke dip.  The beers on tap come out as mostly foam.  Expensive...we won't be back...but I think it will close down soon anyway."}
{"text":"This place is confused by all essence of the word. They are not sure if they are a bar, club or restaurant. We walk in to no one seating us, found our own seats and asked if we could use the self serve beer dispenser and the employee didn't even know how to work it. After she was very expressive about not knowing how to use it she asked someone who did, almost wish she wouldn't have found someone who did. The beer was over pressurized and almost $7 a glass. We also ordered food which was lackluster as well. Employees had no clue what they were doing the whole time. If you could, please find somewhere else to go, definitely not worth it in any aspect."}
{"text":"The Good: The Spinach Artichoke Dip. This was delicious! It was skimpy on the crustini (only enough for about half the dip ... with each crustini being well loaded)

The bad: friend got the Argentine steak medium rare. It came out well done. They asked him if he would like them to redo it. He replied yes (since there is a big difference between medium rare and well done). He was told (by who we think was the manager) that it would take another 10 minutes. His steak came out rare. The inside was still cold and there were grill marks only on one side. He chose to give up and not eat dinner.

We also got the Panko crusted chicken basket - which was overdone (and tough to cut), the fresh pretzel bites - resembled more like over cooked rolls, and the \"cowboy in a park burger\" - which had good onion straws but was very dry.

Finally: we ordered edamame for the 5-year old (asked for traditional since she doesn't do spicy). The cook made them spicy at first (the server caught it and had them redo it). My daughter waited and waited and waited. They finally brought it out to a different table. Once they finally brought it to the table my daughter was able to finally eat (the rest of us were already done with our food).

The service was slow (our server appeared to be the only one working the area). I had to steal my daughter's water to get more water. 

We won't be back"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon we ate at the Park in downtown Phoenix.  We were one of only three tables occupied in mid afternoon so the service should have been good and served within a reasonable amount of time.  It was extremely slow.  There were at least 3 waiters but maybe not more than one cook.
The waitress took our order and didn't write down a thing.  She said it is her job and would get it correct.....wrong.  We ordered 5 items from the kid's menu....2  were brought to the table wrong.  We had children with us who have food allergies so it was important the food order was correct.  One of the kids' plates had carrots and celery rather than french fries.  The waitress insisted on taking the plate back to the kitchen rather than just bringing the fries.  This added another 10 minutes to getting more of the order.  We ordered an appetizer but it was served with the main dishes.  The kid's hamburger was very small but the french fries were generous.  The macaroni and cheese had an odd taste and was not very cheesy.   The waiters would bring some of the food and then come back 10 minutes later with more so it took a long time for everyone to have their food.  It was impossible to eat together as the food arrived over 20 to 30 minutes.
Two adults ordered the street tacos.  They were 2 very tiny tacos served with lots of chips and a tiny amount of ice cold salsa for $8.  The chicken sandwiches were good and the hamburger was so-so.
For 5 adults and 4 children the bill was $102 with no alcohol.  We definitely will not be back.  There was no excuse the service was so slow.  Glad it wasn't busy or we would still be waiting for our food."}
{"text":"Came to the park and kyle was the best. He made us laugh with his awesome personality and knew a lot about the menu. Definitely coming back here soon. Only had drinks but the drinks were really good."}
{"text":"(Red) Nachos: BOMB. Fries: BOMB. Aioli sauce for the fries: BOMB. Tacos: BOMB. I come here often and I'm not quite sure why yelpers are rating this place so poorly to me it seems those that come in during busy hours during concerts or events have a hard time. But it's like that everywhere during events ? So I'm not sure. It's super clean place, the ambiance is awesome and the people are always friendly. Plus the food has always been really good."}
{"text":"Be warned: the self-pour taps are iffy. In the picture attached, the beer on the left cost 2cents per oz more than the beer on the right, but the total costs were dramatically different.

Left beer: 47c per oz, $4.40 total cost
Right beer: 45c per oz, $9.71 total cost

My verdict would be that happy hour cocktails are a better deal than the taps. Not knowing what the end cost is going to be is a bit of a nightmare... definitely not a certified measure of weight."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Lots of room and huge TVs to watch sports! I'll definitely be back! The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"I've followed the building and opening of those place on social media and as really excited to try it out! We went last night before seeing Harry Potter at the Phoenix Symphony and it didn't disappoint! The atmosphere is laid back, but still classy enough for a date. It's a great event space, I would totally have a wedding here was my first thought. They do holiday parties as well. Now for the BEER...they have a cool wall full of great beer choices. You get a card and pour directly from the tap and when you're all tapped out you pay. The FOOD...many choices. We had the nachos, Asian chicken salad and the special burger. The burger was amazing and fresh. The chicken salad was awesome and it's hard to screw up nachos. Excellent food and atmosphere for this place. 
We will be back! Thanks Chyna for your excellent service and thanks to The Park for another great place in Phoenix to hang out!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try The Park as it is walking distance from my residence.  We went on a Sunday evening so the establishment was not very busy.  The décor is well done and fun and it included a couple of fake trees as well as a multicolored ping pong table that is free to use.  

The procedure to order is a bit confusing if you have not been there before.  You wait in a line to order but it is not clear where the line starts.  There are several different menu items to review so the process was slow as there were a few people ahead of us that could not decide what to order.  We ended up getting the lobster Mac and Cheese as well as a Park salad.  The Lobster mac & Cheese was very bland and contained less than 4 pieces of small lobster bits.  Not what we were expecting for $16.  The Park Salad was good but was over dressed.  One issue is that we wanted to split the orders.  The food is served in large bowls and when we asked for side plates, we were told they did not have any.  They ended up giving us plastic trays with wax liners to use as plates.  

We also tried the beer wall.  This is a great concept but fails on execution.  You have to purchase a card for a set amount (I believe $10 is minimum) and then put the card on a reader and start to pour your beer.  The problem is foam.  Mostly foams comes out of the taps and you end up paying a lot of money for a glass of mostly foam (you can see the dollars roll off the card on the readout when you are pouring).  The benefit of the pour wall is that you can try a lot of different beers (mostly microbrews) without having to order a full beer.  Still, the cost is heavy and we ended up with extra dollars on the card we did not use.  You can use the card on a return visit but it is unlikely we will go back."}
{"text":"Thank you Kyle! Great service, food, and Drink! We had a great time. Beautiful night out with the garage door open!"}
{"text":"Negative 5 stars

My girlfriend waited for over an hour and finally got a salad after everyone at the table had eaten. They only brought 3 dishes at a time. 

Bad news. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Spacious, airy, and self serve beer.  Burgers look amazing, too bad I'm not hungry.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"5 stars to our bar tender,  Blanca! However, the atmosphere was terrible. Saturday night at 10pm and no one came help her out.... we sat and stared at servers bringing dirty dishes and stacking them in front of us, trashes filled to the brim... then went into the bathroom, so gross! My advice walk on by...."}
{"text":"Really bad experience. Actually this was my second bad experience in my only two visits here. Overall, I like the concept and location and size. It's easy for a big party to meet here. The food truck concept and beer and wine wall are also great ideas. The execution and service, however are AWFUL. 1) We were in for a Sunday night dinner and drinks before an event. The place wasn't too busy but everything took FOREVER. There was a line for seemingly no reason at the main bar. 2) The beer wall concept NEEDS to be fixed. Why do I have to pre-purchase a certain amount? You are limiting your sales. Make it so that I can take what I want and just charge me at the end. Z Pizza does this about 4 blocks away and it is MUCH better. We were told we had to put money on a card in advance. So we had to guess how much we wanted to drink. Then, we were told we can get any money back we didn't use. When we went to do this at the end, the server complained and says that \"no one ever does this,\" and it took FOREVER. 3) The food on both my trips into the Park took FOREVER AND came out cold. Last night we had a Lobster Mac and Cheese that came out literally chilled. Our other food was also lukewarm. 4) Back to the beer wall- fix the foam issue. I know how to pour beer and your CO2 must be off because the head on each glass is way too much. 5) Back to the food: The line to order food was about 10 people long and it took about 20 minutes just to order. That is WAY too long. I eat out in the central phoenix area 4-5 nights a week, and this has been my worst experience. They really need to figure it out."}
{"text":"The food was decent.  Service was TERRIBLE! Almost walked out, luckily bartender came over and at least gave us menus and said if server isn't here soon he would serve us.  Food came out in a timely manner but we literally waited 24 minutes after they took our empty plates to get the check and we got it from asking a food runner walking by.  Server was talking to friends at bar and NEVER came back!  Horrible!  Table next to us walked out after waiting 5-6 mins.  SMH

Place is all over the place looking for its identity.  If you ask me the self serve taps could be lit better so someone would want to go get beer rather than worry someone might not come back!  If you ask me the identity is ..... won't be here in a year unless they get a clue on how to greet and treat customers!"}
{"text":"Big day. Home opener for the DBacks. Final Four activities.

Cool atmosphere. Good food. Decent beer.

Lousy service. The bartender was overburdened AND clueless.

We arrived at about 11:15am. The bartender already did not have the necessary glasses. She was serving the barstools, the surrounding tables, and the server orders. Impossible.

The calamari & fries came quickly, once we could place an order, and the food was hot and tasty.
 Pedal Haus brews, on tap. No complaints, there.

Manager showed up to start helping.

We'll give The Park another chance, when it is a little slower paced."}
{"text":"Booooooo. 

The idea is great, but you really shouldn't make a place that has a food truck menu and looks like a sports bar seem like a fancy pants night club. After paying $25 for a tiny burrito and a beer, we literally had nowhere to sit other than a tiny countertop surrounded by people in line and phone chargers. 

I saw a number of empty tables but all of them were blocked off and \"reserved\". I was told they were VIP when I asked if we could sit somewhere to eat our food. The server was nice and confirmed with his manager that my group could sit there since they didn't have anyone coming in. Once we sat down a girl came up and told us that the tables were reserved and we couldn't sit there. She grabbed her manager Joe, who acted like we were lying when we told him we were told by staff that we could sit there. 

My burrito was mas-o-menos and the tortilla smelled like play-dough. Ceviche tasted fishy as funk. My beer even had a huge chip in the glass. 

The reviews say enough and are 100% valid. Take my advice when I say you aren't missing anything by skipping over this place. I'd say go to Arrogant Butcher if you're wanting to spend that kind of money. At least your food will be fantastic, the service will be fabulous and you'll feel like a valued customer. 

I almost would have rather gone next door to Fired Pie. At least I'd be able to sit at an actual table and the food would be worth the price. 

Anyway... those tables were open from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. Smart business model Joe Joe. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Love this bar, I come here all the time and we had Kyle this time. He was so funny and was so easy to talk with. Best server we have had and we will be back. Thank you Kyle for the great experience for me and my family."}
{"text":"Horribly understaffed. Game day for Dbacks and a concert at talking Stick arena. Talked to manager who made excuses and didn't make anything right. What a joke. Place was empty...."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Place was not busy at all 1pm. Bartender she was rude only asked for menus and she said (little busy). Because asking for a menu was to much work, think maybe little under staffed bartender, 1 server work the best. Server didn't go to table much at all."}
{"text":"Great space, open and inviting.  Moderately good beer selection.  Food was better than expected (try the ribs).  Plenty of screens for sports viewing.  Friendly service"}
{"text":"This place is great for hanging out before or after a baseball game, or another event downtown.  Not the best food but good, drinks are cold and they have a fun drink menu. It's worth a stop in but not the best in town."}
{"text":"Great lobster roll, service was acceptable, menu is based on truck food. Try it out, you will be surprised"}
{"text":"Excellent location! Across the street from the Talking Stick Resort Arena and a couple blocks up from Chase Field. Excellent atmosphere inside. That is about where it ends. Went in before the D'backs game yesterday and service was OK. Wait staff delivering our food to another table, confusion about a strawberry daiquiri and Campfire Stick Egg Rolls came at room temperature not to mention a fish & chips order that was just poorly executed. The spinach and artichoke dip was the best item to touch the table by far. Maybe it was just a bad day at the Park on this day but I feel like there is potential here."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this after visiting a similar establishment in Denver. We were let down in so many ways...

-The menu boards kept slowly fading on and off, so they would randomly disappear for 15 seconds while trying to figure out what we wanted

-Two of our three entrees were not even close to what we ordered. One was specifically ordered \"no meat\" (which the cashier did confirm); basically recieved a beef burrito. The other was an order of 3 carne asada tacos; got one carne asada, one pork, and one shrimp. We had to go up to the counter to find someone to correct our order (which it eventually was), but it took several minutes for the cashier to hunt down someone to fix our order

-DO NOT GET THE SELF SERVE BEER! They charge by the ounce and you get charged whether you get beer or foam, so forget about topping off to get rid of any foam. Don't know if it matters too much because about 1/3rd of the taps were out of service. They do also have a regular bar, so just get your drinks there.

-Also related to the self serve beer, I bought a $20 card which turned out to be loaded with $19 and some change, so I had to hunt down someone to fix this. Turns out that if you try to buy more than two drinks you'll have to go see an employee to get your card unlocked (I was using one card to buy for multiple people)

-The tortilla chips are fresh. I know because they were still soaking wet in oil when they arrived with the entrees

-The tacos are microscopic. Four inch tortillas with two chunks of meat each (one if you get pork) for $3 each

-The wait staff is all obviously experienced in working in restaurants, but after our food was delivered they were nowhere to be found. This made getting our orders fixed and getting the issues with beer fixed difficult"}
{"text":"Service is horrible! Staff is lazy, food was disgusting and cold it tasted like microwaved food. Don't come here at all."}
{"text":"No atmosphere, subpar food and terrible service. Never do the pour your own beer option because you're going to be wasting your money on foamy beer."}
{"text":"The place is a poor version of a park. Nothing about it made me think park. Definitely will not be returning when there is many other spots downtown that live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Here's a rundown of my experience -- draw your own conclusions. 

Service: 

Spotty. As a first-time visitor it would have been nice if the hostess explained the self-serve nature of all the beverages (soda and alcohol). Mine was a party of two and we were sat in the bar area. It took a solid 15 minutes for staff to get to us, and it was the manager. He was very nice and accommodating but I'm pretty sure he was also acting as the only server for a very large section of the restaurant. I was there before a Suns game. We were sat immediately but it was busy. We ordered right away -- it took 35 minutes to get our food.

Food: 

Good. I'd eat it again. We split the Lobstah Roll and the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. Pork sandwich was well seasoned but dry. There was very little sauce on it. However, the coleslaw was amazing! Very fresh and light but also so flavorful. Very good! The lobster roll was also very fresh tasting and full of buttery goodness. The roll was crispy, soft and perfectly toasted. The French fries were also a delight! They were crispy and served with a savory aioli that was so good I couldn't stop eating fries even after I was full.

I think I would go back, but only if it was slow so maybe I could enjoy faster service."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday night, maybe 15 people in the place. Was ignored by bartender and waitresses for 10 min before we decided to leave. Customer service is awful. Never acknowledged our presence even though a waitress passed our table 3 times"}
{"text":"I also left a review via FB so I'm copy & pasting.....lol.

Hubby and I went last night, parked around the corner and had a nice little walk to The Park. We first encountered Ethan out front, super nice guy and he gave us coupons.....lol. Then we were seated by a friendly hostess and soon after that our server Ashley stopped by and she took great care of us the entire meal. We had the brisket nachos and mozzarella planks, both very tasty and delivered by another friendly staff member. My only two complaints (and I'm not taking stars away) were I wasn't impressed with the selection of self pour beer (more local selection) but that's a matter of perception and you guys have got to do something about how much your chilled glasses foam, you shouldn't have to rinse a chilled glass first. I've been to self pour spots before, never had an issue. All in all we had fun and we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced and not very exciting. My friend and I wanted to get cards to pour our own beers and the bartender said it would be way cheaper to just order from her because if we do self serve we will just get foam. We each ordered a pint of Pedal Haus Light Lager and she asked if we wanted a pitcher instead. We agreed, then ended up paying $26.00 for one pitcher!!! That is insane. I can see paying maybe even $18.00 for a pitcher of craft beer, but come on!! This would make each individual beer $7.50. I'm sure our beer tab would have been much less with self serve or ordering pints. We split the Walk in the Park Sampler. Definitely not worth $17.00. The wings were bland, the chips has queso already on them so they were cold when we got them, the pretzel bites and mozzarella sticks were decent, but nothing to write home about, and they forgot to bring out the ranch, salsa, and queso dips. I was so excited to try this place, but I don't think I will go back, nor will I recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"Came to the park for my first weekly run (meet me downtown). A civic event that celebrated its 160th week today. 
Sat at a bar top for 13 minutes before I was approached. Asked about the 10% discount and any specials included with the event. The waitress checked and said there were no specials or discounts with the event-- I figured what the hell, it's 10%. 
I ordered a miller lite, pulled pork sandwich and Mac & cheese (I had just run a 10k and needed some carbs). 
While I was waiting they made an announcement that the specials for the event included 10% off; a $2 beer, $5 wine and $1 soda. The announcement also said if the waiter doesn't know about he specials ask for a manager and they'll take care of it. 
20 minutes later received my sandwich-- no silverware, no beer, no water refill. Asked for a manager for confirmation of specials while I waited for my beer. 
Waited about 15 minutes and the waitress comes to me and asks if she can get me anything-- since I hadn't touched my sandwich and side. I said, \"the manager, my beer, silverware\" 

The report back was that the manager hadn't shown up yet, and no one had been made aware of the specials (which had been running for 160 weeks). The only manager on duty was the beer manager. The waitress was less than thrilled when I asked; \"if that's the case why don't I have my beer\" 

Overall the service was pretty embarrassing to say the least. I'm shocked the event keeps coming back when the wait staff has no clue what specials they are offering and the manager doesn't even bother to come in. 

The bar is very cool looking but it's clearly a big miss. Very unfortunate. 

I was at my table for a total for 37 minutes. Never received a water refill, my ordered beer or silverware. 

Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Grossly understaffed for a Saturday night after a concert! Out of most of the tap beers - ridiculous."}
{"text":"The set up of the restaurant is amazing. I love the stage and the huge screen they have located right behind it. The two trees inside the building are interesting and definitely fit with the whole \"park indoors\" vibe. The placement of the two bars are spectacular. The greatest thing about the park is the design....I would talk about the alcohol, but let's be real.....beer is beer and any kind of hard alcohol is the same anywhere you go. (10 out of 10) 

The reason for the 3 stars is because of the food. I ordered a \"taco truck\" taco and one of the beef and potato burritos with green sauce. In order to consume the taco you would first need to locate it. The taco was the size of a quarter. The burrito reminded me of an elementary school lunch, lacking any kind of seasoning or substance."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for this place to open for so long and was I disappointed.  The concept of the self serving beer bar is such a great idea.... not so great here, no matter how slow you do the poor and tilt your glass it was 80% foam.  Watched so many people walk away with the same half full glass of foam.  Decided to try a few different mixed drinks and I am pretty sure they forgot to add any liquor.  We told the server and of course told you can't taste the liquor because the mix is sweet.  Hmmm interesting response is all I could think.
Food....eat before you go, I got the three tacos with chips.  Tacos were less than stellar and I have never had chips that were so salty.  Husband had the BBQ which was dry and uneventful.
Plus side the wait staff was super friendly, and the band was pretty good."}
{"text":"Had a blast definitely coming back! Waiters are very nice and hatd working. The food was great and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I don't have much of anything bad to say about this place. I haven't tried the food yet so I cant say it's 5 stars yet, but a few friends and I came here after a Rattlers game. We sat up at the back bar, had a few beers, walked around and found the games and checked out the fun décor. I really liked the fake tree's and that the table tennis and shuffle board were virtual. That is something I had never seen before. I found it to be very cozy and clean. Our bartender added some flare to his job and tossed those bottles around like a pro. Everyone was super friendly and the prices weren't bad. I will for sure be back to try the food and play some games."}
{"text":"Everything was great, from their food, to there being plenty of games to play. Love how there's a huge tree in the middle of the bar. And I liked the concept of pouring your own beer out of a tap, while the screen shows a description, including alcohol content"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Been coming for lunch almost everyday! The service is great, the vibe is nice and our waitress Mary is always so nice and gets the food out to me fast! The drinks are delicious too!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after we went ice skating at City Skate. We were going to go to The Hardrock Cafe next door but decided to come here since I had never been here before. It was around 930pm when we arrived, immediately went to sit out on the patio to enjoy the weather. We sat at the table for a good while, but when no one greeted us, my date went to the bar to get us a drink and ask for menus since I was starving. He came back and said there is no food served on the patio, even though we saw a group of people that obviously had plates of food, sitting on the patio. We went inside and attempted to find a table that wasn't near the huge speakers so we could have a conversation and hear each other speak. We again sat for a good while, waiting for a waitress to come greet us but still nothing. My date again went up to the bar and asked for a menu to grab something to eat. It was now 10:05pm, and I remember this because the bartender said that they stopped serving food at 10pm. Why didn't he say this when we first talked to him?

I was beyond annoyed, so we finished our drinks and left. If I was maybe in my early 20s and/or still enjoyed to party like I was 21 then maybe I would come back. Maybe I sound like an old 32yo crotchety old lady, but I didn't like the huge loud speakers in the middle of the bar. If you're into that, then yes there were awesome speakers and large TV screens. Also ping pong, self-serve beer, and large Jenga which is nice for a fun group."}
{"text":"Stopped into this new establishment located near the Chase Ballpark and the Talking Stick Arena on my way to a Ball game.  Very nice venue, open concept with plenty of TV's for sports viewing.  The concept of being in an outdoor setting while sitting indoors will go well during the cooler months.  The service was quick and the food was surprisingly inexpensive considering the location and the cost of real estate near the sports venues.  All orders that we good were very tasty and well done.  Interesting concept in ordering in which you can go to the ordering station to put in your order or just give your request to the wait staff.  The food is then delivered by other personnel to your table.  The use of the delivery staff ensures that your server will always be available for another round of drinks.  They have outdoor seating and the view of the downtown area is interesting.  If visiting the downtown area or going to a sporting event, this is a convenient place to stop for a drink or a meal prior to heading into the venues.  Another interesting concept which I have never seen before is the purchase of a card to allow the personal drawing of one of 36 beers on tap.  Based on what I have been told, since I don't drink beer, the patron can lad the card for several brews and at their leisure pick the beer of their choice and not have to use any of the wait staff.  No complaints on not having a full glass of beer.  Heard that future expansions are in the works.  We'll just have to wait and see."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Park concept, but stay away from the Flyin' Hawaiian food truck!  The rice was hard...which is basically 50% of the meal.  I told a team member and they said they would send over a manager and it never happened...epic fail in my book!  

Love the beer garden feel, live music, DJ and extensive menu selections too...I'll choose a different food truck on my next visit though!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here before the Justin Timberlake concert and meet some friends.  First time here and I'm a little less than impressed.  

Let's start with the first huge issue.  The seating here is absolutely horrible.  The tables are so close together that each person has 0 room to even scoot away from the table or move anywhere.  Backs of seats and touching the person behind you and you have to move the table just to get out.  One or two less tables could solve this problem but less tables means less money so clearly customer comfort is a little less of a priority than the all mighty dollar.  

Next let's talk about the concept of serve your own beer and paying with a pre paid card.  Amazing idea, helps reduce wait time between drinks and is fun but is so over priced.  When you pay by the ounce and you go to pour your beer and the first half comes out all foam before you know it you've paid 9-10 dollars for a 12 oz beer which might as well be concert arena prices.  So while the concept is neat do yourself a favor and order from the bar.  

Let's move on to the food now.  I understand they were very busy but it shouldn't take almost an hour to get an order of pretzel bites out.  Which came out cold and dry to boot.  We also had orders at the table of the lobster Mac and fish and chips.  All the food was very lack luster to say it best for the price you pay it's not a great deal at all.  

The best part of this place was our server Mary.  She was very helpful and extremely nice.  She even chased after us when we left because I had forgotten my sunglasses on the table.  This was definitely going above and beyond and appreciated more than she might know.  

I'm always willing to come back and try somewhere twice but it did not give me the best first impression."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...lots of room...breezy...nice menus...the fries are amazing! It even has a self serve beer bar...how cool! Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Brought my brother here who is visiting from NY. Thought it would be a good place before a DB game. Was I ever wrong. Took 20 minutes to get a beer order in, brough the appetizer out with the main meal. Served us raw wings. I'm not talking a little pink, totally raw! The tortilla chips were almost dripping grease and OH, to top it off, of course there was a hair in my brothers food. Not his, he's bald.. Just awful from start to finish. I cant get the full priced bill quick enough to get out if here! Yuck!! I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first night and it was slammmmmmeeedd!! Which was amazing for the venue!! And although busy we were cool with the people watching and the food didn't come out long either, which is a plus. The menu is pretty large and going to get bigger just like the space. The space is awesome and did an amazing job on the renovation. Last time I even visited it was  Stoudemire's tells you how long I've been there. 

They have a ping pong table, crazy large stage for a band with screens all over the area. 

The staff was super friendly, quick, and on their game. I was with friends and we got the honey Sriracha wings which were fantastic, the Taco trio, and the Ahi Poke bowl. Let's talk about the Poke Bowl. Something was off with the rice, so we were looking around and the owner, Phil, came up and said is everything ok and can I help. WOW!! The owner on a slammed night had the emotional intelligence, saw me, and knew to come over. Do you know how key that is? Awareness is vital on busy nights and everyone should be engaged, the boss was. So immediately he came over we told him what's up, he actually tasted it and made it right for us. 

Even got us an app on the house. Service is key and the whole staff got it. Seriously it just doesn't happen as often as it should and to know it happened and was executed with precision is even better. 

The food was good overall, the atmosphere was fun, lively, tons of action going on, and most of all it was running smoothly from my POV. 

I like this place as we discussed at the table it is good and will be good for any game, any event, anything Downtown and is catered to everyone from the layout to the food, it will hit anyone's meter. I will be back for sure and specifically be back because the service I experienced was great."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time unless you want to be bored. Sat nite in Phoenix and there were maybe 30 people there. Most of them were in a foosball tourney. Can't see how they stay open. No wonder Barrio Cafe left. I've had more fun in a Greyhound bus depot."}
{"text":"My wife and I live downtown and spend a quite a bit of time in various bars in the area. We were pretty excited about The Park when we first started hearing about it, but after two visits, I doubt we'll go back.

Visit 1 - Wife and I went in at about 10PM on a Friday night. We were just roaming around downtown and decided to pop in for a first look. Place was maybe half full. Took quite a while to get the attention of a bartender, and even longer to get a couple of simple draft beers. There was a band setting/warming up on the stage, so we thought this would be cool. 

After a half hour the band still hadn't started, our beers were empty, and no one asked us if we wanted more beer. We decided to leave and go to Copper Blues instead, since their bands are always playing by 9:30 and we don't have to beg for refills.

On the way out, I asked the doorman why they hired a band that didn't actually play music. He said the band wasn't scheduled to go on until 11. Oh, okay. Cool for them, but I thought I was in Phoenix, not LA.

Visit 2 - My adult daughter and I were on the Urban Wine Walk. We heard at another bar that The Park had recently cleaned house and completely replaced their staff, so I decided to give it another crack. We arrived at about 1:30 to find all the seats at the north bar taken, though mainly by the handbags of the five or six women sitting at the bar. There were plenty of seats at the south bar, but it was closed.

We were directed to a high top table in the north bar area, which was fine. A young man who was apparently a manager asked us a couple of times if we were sure we didn't want a booth and some food menus. We declined, citing the Wine Walk. Eventually a pleasant and friendly server came to take our order. We mentioned we were doing the Wine Walk and she replied that she'd only been told The Park was participating an hour before. She did give us some Wine Walk maps, and we ordered our wine samples.

Fifteen minutes later, still no samples. Our server had been standing at the service bar the entire time, furiously tapping the register screen. Some other Wine Walkers came into the bar and ordered their samples, which the bartender started pouring immediately. We waited five more minutes before we decided to leave without sampling any wine. We went to The Strand and immediately got samples. Now, the Wine Walk is a five-hour event with about 30 restaurants. Waiting around for 20+ minutes just for samples to arrive REALLY cuts into a Wine Walker's time.

The Park's concept is pretty cool, but the execution is sorely lacking. I doubt I'll ever go back. There are many better options in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention.   Came in on a Wednesday night.  The food was awesome.   The staff was incredible. and the service was amazing.   Very efficient,  and friendly. We liked it so much we came back Thursday AND Friday!  I would highly recommend this place for dining, and for casual fun!  I highly recommend the Back to Cali sandwich and the forbidden fruit martini.   We WILL be returning!"}
{"text":"There is only one reason to go to this place.  That is to buy drinks/food before a stadium game when you don't have time to go anywhere else.  That is because only in the bizzarro world of stadium food/drink quality/pricing could this be an acceptable place to eat/drink.

The food is okay if expensive.  One chicken wing was undercooked (bloody) but the rest seemed okay.  The chicken nachos were actually decent.  

But honestly, whoever measures/certifies the meters at gas stations needs to come and shut this place down for the fraud of their self-serve beers.  Despite all these reviews, I couldn't believe it wasn't fixed. 

Big mistake.  

It's worse.  Despite knowing how to pour from many self-serve experiences, I poured myself 16 ounces of foam.  The machine registers all 16 ounces.  But when the foam settled, I had 4-5 oz. of beer.  At .67 an ounce, do the math.  16x.67=$10.72, which in and of itself is HIGHWAY ROBBERY.  But then when you only get 4 ounces of actual beer for $10.72, it's the most expensive beer ever poured.

Look, whatever you do, do NOT do their self pour beers.  At worst it's fraud.  At best (let's give them the benefit of the doubt), it's a warranty issue that the owner evidently has no intent to solve.  Why would he?   He must be printing money.

If you go there, pay for your beer by the pint, from the bartender, or go for a mixed drink.

Or better yet, walk 2 blocks in any direction and go there.

Some restaurants honestly probably don't deserve to stay open.  I think this is one of them."}
{"text":"We decided to go here before a concert. We like to arrive to venues very early to beat the crowd, so we got here early afternoon and were able to get a table for two. It took a few minutes just to be greeted. It took even longer for our server to bring our waters and two menus. We had been there about 30 minutes before we were able to put our food order in. During the wait for our food, our server never came back to our table to refill glasses. I had ordered a beer and decided to walk to the beer garden to have it refilled since our server disappeared. The beer garden however was out of about a third of the beers on tap. (Letdown.) 

There was live music playing which was great, and for a time kept our minds off of how long our food was taking. We kept seeing plates coming out of the kitchen, none of which were ours. Tables that had been sat after us had been served while we hadn't. What's worse is we saw the food runners bring plates out to tables not knowing where they were going. One guy put a plate down on a table, the patron touched the sandwich to see if it was his. It was not. The food runner then took the plate away, and brought it to the correct table a few feet away. AFTER someone else had touched that food! 

As we hadn't seen our server, my husband got up to ask another employee if they could please check on the status of our table. Our food had never been put in! At this point we had been in this establishment for about 90 minutes. We were then assured that our food would be prioritized. Thirty minutes after THAT it still hadn't come out. Honestly, we ordered burgers! We are not the type to complain, but two hours after we sit down is truly unacceptable. My husband did speak with one of the managers, who did apologize and not charge us for the drinks our server had brought us. So that's something. We ended up leaving and having hot dogs from the concession stand at Talking Stick Arena. Let me tell ya, after that experience, those hot dogs were delicious! We will not be back, and I cannot recommend this place. I will say that I like the decor and the idea behind this place. Maybe they have their shit together when there are no events downtown, but that day was awful!"}
{"text":"First time visitor. I've looked at the menu several times when looking for lunch spots and the idea behind this restaurant is awesome and I was really excited to try it! 
Was Severely disappointed!! The service was practically non-existent! And the food was even worse!!
All 3 entrees ordered were barely edible! My mother ordered the nachos (seriously hard to screw up nachos..) and it was bland and mushy and did not even include the enchilada sauce that the menu mentioned for extra flavor. I ordered the ahi tuna street tacos, which were disappointing. They were also bland and the huge raw veggie slices didn't add anything special. My boyfriend ordered the sriracha honey wings, which tasted pretty good, so we thought we had one win. Except that as soon as we walked out the door, he had to run back inside to vomit!! And this crappy meal was over $60!!

If I could give this place 0/5 stars, I would. Crappy service and even worse food. Which sucks, because this place has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"This is a good idea, but not being implemented well. They haven't been open for long, but they should have better service. It was really chaotic. I really like the pour your own beer concept and the pricing is good,  but the table  service for food needs improvement. We had to flag someone down to make an order, and we never did get silverware or plates for our appetizers, so had to hunt down our own napkins. Not sure why they had cage fighting on every tv. Didn't seem to match the atmosphere at all. We got them to switch to the Diamondback game however. This is not a sports bar, but not sure really how to classify it. We ordered wings and a chips and dip appetizer, and they were fine. This place has potential, but they need to get organized."}
{"text":"I loved the style of the restaurant/bar but it was so lonely. We were the only people there so we had all the games to ourselves (by the way they are FREE) they have jenga, ping pong (aka table tennis) and another table game (do not know the name). Do go before 10 unless you like peace and quite. The Rangers nachos the regular size was definitely enough for 2. The red sauces was the best. Happy hour gives you $2 less of the drinks and better deals on the food. The don't always have live music so dot expect it. I was told it's actually rare."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday before the Diamondbacks game.  Great space and beer selection.  Easy walk to Talking Stick Arena and Chase Field.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The Park has a great concept. I love the idea of pouring my own beer and having an indoor picnic. It's totally my style.

Unfortunately, we tired The Park on a Saturday afternoon after walking around the Rainbow festival all day. When we walked in, the place was EMPTY. I didn't think too much of it because it was a little late for lunch and too early for dinner, but I have to admit I was expecting there to be a small crowd with all the events in DTPHX that day.

After being seated, we were given menus by a sever who said she would be right back. We never saw her again. 

My group sat for about 30 minutes, not seeing another person who worked there before we finally walked out to find something better."}
{"text":"This place sucked! The service was terrible and the food was worse than some major restaurant chains. House salad was just lettuce and $4 for a half order, no cabbage, no carrots, nothing else! Maybe they hope people getintoxicated enough to make them think the food tastes good."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Menus is simple and takes no effort to make yet it takes over an hour to get your food. After paying for our lobster mac and cheese we never got it. Apparently they ran out and we only found out because I approached the wait staff about the remaining order. 

Decent selection of beer... nothing to waste your time with."}
{"text":"The half self service / half full service concept is not very clear.  Staff is still having opening pains... and the food wasn't great.  There were several customers complaining to management about the self-serve beer.  My beer choice was served by my cashier, so I can't complain there.  Unlikely I will re-visit."}
{"text":"Service was great. Atmosphere and vibe was on point! Food was served quick. But my pulled pork sliders were a little dry. They needed more sauce and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Excellent food and super chill vibe for a sports bar. Great location and very friendly staff. Good times here!"}
{"text":"We tried going here yesterday but it was such terrible service. There was a sign that said, please wait to be seated, so we waited. Waited, waited, and waited some more. We stood there at the podium for about 15 min before anyone even came back up to the front to acknowledge us. We had even made eye contact with multiple waiters, trying to wave them over to help us be seated, but we were ignored. By this time, there were 7 people standing up near the front all getting impatient that we were not even being seated when there were many open tables available. My mom and I walked out and we will never try to eat here again. Such a waste of time."}
{"text":"I'm in town for work, and decided to walk around downtown to find some food after getting checked in to my hotel. I was in Phoenix in late January, but wanted to try a new place out (we had great experiences as we tried a few new places a day the last time I was here). I saw The Park and decided to try it.. Not a welcoming place at all. I kind of wandered around until I found a seat after several servers just stared at me. I found a seat eventually, and after a few minutes a bartender asked if I was still doing okay. I told her that I've been waiting, and she half apologized and got my order. Anyway, I got my food, which was pretty fast, and it was decent. I got a burger and fries. Food was good, service was terrible. Not welcoming like other places I experienced when I was in town last."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the interior is nice, they have like huge trees with chandeliers hanging from them. Its very open which makes u feel welcoming!

I ordered the park hamburger and it was bombbbb. The meat was so soft and it was just heaven. The fries were so crispy and addicting!!! 

Bar wise they have draft beers set up kind of like a yogurt stand LOL love it.

The waitresses are very nice and i would come back when im in the area"}
{"text":"Live music, nice huge screen behind singer. This is gonna be nice during football  season! A little crowded in the area where you pour your own drinks. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm a regular and have never seen someone more on top of everything than RC was. I've never seen him around but for someone who seems to be new I am so impressed with how he made sure I was served and happy to the fullest extent!! Even as a regular this makes me want to go back more because I know I'm taken care of! Thank you RC and thank you to The Park for keeping great employees working."}
{"text":"First time here nice layout friendly staff and awesome concept. The beer card serve yourself is a cool thing to have. The big screen and many other tv's works for me. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went to the park for the second time yesterday. First time I stopped in on my lunch pretty busy. Yesterday it was really slow almost as if they were closed. Which I was not unhappy about. I was immediately greeted and got my pick of a table. The waiter who expressed she normally don't wait (Amanda) table side manners was perfect. She had perfect timing with following up, ensuring I didn't need anything but allowing me a bit of space at the time without being over bearing. It was a lunch visit again less than 6 minutes for my food to come and I was able to complete my entire meal. The place was very clean and calm. I see plenty people are turned away by it being slow and quiet. Just wanted to let you know that it's many people like myself that's stoping In on lunch from work or after a long day of work that appreciate the vibe when it's slow and chill."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but we did not. The only redeeming thing I can say is that the hostess was very sweet and gave us a tour since it was our first time. She showed us how the DIY beer pouring worked. After that, we decided to sit at the bar and that was a mistake. The beers on tap at the bar was a small selection. I asked the bartender if those beers were the only ones we could order and he said yes. Why? There is a whole wall of beers!! Couldn't he go over there and get us something different? So I settled for Cider which is not a favorite. He poured our beers without asking us any further questions and I noticed they were the large size, not a pint. I asked him if they offer pints and he says it's the better deal with the bigger size. Ok? So he just decided on his own what is best for us without giving us choices? Not cool at all. Two beers cost $18.46 and that is outrageous. I wanted to order food but despite this place having a large menu, it is not at all vegetarian friendly. How can you expect to be a successful restaurant in 2018 when you don't offer food for everyone? They had burgers on the menu, but no meatless burgers which freeze easily and would definitely sell to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. My only options were pretzel bites or french fries which were both $10 each! WTH? Or, a full priced salad without the meat (but of course I would have to pay for the meat I don't want). NO THANK YOU. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food awesome... waited 45 min to 1 hour for food.... and 1 drink the \"deep ocean\" was $18 they don't list prices of drinks of menu!!"}
{"text":"I've tried to come to this place several times in the past few times and each time, it's just been super dead, even on a Friday or Saturday night before/after a sporting event or concert etc.

I finally stopped in with my boyfriend after a game at Talking Stick. Again, it was pretty dead, even though it looks like a chill enough place. What drew us in was the sign that said \"penny domestic beers or well drinks after any concert/game with event tickets\" and the slightly buzzed party outside saw us contemplating and encouraged us to capitalize on the the deal.

So we made our way to a high top and took a few minutes to look over the menu. We both just got a rum and diet and decided on a couple burgers/sandwiches. I think my boyfriend got some bbq cowboy burger and I ordered the specialty Bauer burger. We both thought they were pretty average, not really worth the price. And the food took a while to come out too.

All in all, I don't really recommend this for anything more than the penny drink specials after a game or event at the stadiums nearby."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential but it just doesn't get there. It's called the park and they really emphasize that theme in their logo, but the only park like thing there are 2 trees inside. No artificial grass, picnic tables, lawn games or anything that would remind you of a park. The service is always kind but very slow. Food is overpriced and mediocre at best. As others have said, skip right over the pour your own beer option. I get a glass of foam every time. My husband says this is user error but unless you're a bartender or familiar with co2 taps, you are going to pay for foam. The games are basic bar games, nothing special or different about them. I want to like this place so badly and have gone there probably 5 times now, but I really think I'm going to have to pass going forward."}
{"text":"Been hearing about the hype of this place for a few months and was highly disappointed. Too many steps to get what you want, service was slow and inconsistent, and the food was not worth $13 a plate. I would save your money and go somewhere else worthwhile in the area. The first entree came out 15 min before the second. The carne asada is something I would compare to canned cat food. The salad looked like it had died and came back with a vengeance. Soggy, and gross. Wish I had the guts to ask for my money back, but it's only the second day open so I feel bad."}
{"text":"I'm not really a review guy but if I can save anyone from this train wreck it will be worth it. First off, we were under the impression this was going to be very different than it turned out to be. Instead of a food truck vibe, think food court. We tried the Frito Pie which was basically just pure salt. And in reading other reviews it sounds like salt is a problem here with many things.  Completely inedible. Also tried one of the tuna dishes. The tuna was incredibly funky and should not have been served. Then we had the safest bet on the menu, kids chicken tenders. But they were completely flavorless....just seems like an item that would be tough to screw up, but not for the Park. The beer wall gimmick was pure foam. We spent $20 on 1.5 beers and had to wait in line for the privilege of getting this card loaded with $ and again to retrieve my ID which they held (or I could have paid $3 for a card to keep). It was just a calamity of errors at every turn....almost laughable it was so awful. Even the play area feels like a poorly executed garage sale. They need to close the place down and reassess everything that they are doing and try again or it's going to be a very short run. My wife asked to speak with a manager which I was not in favor of but she thought it was important since they're new and it would be good for them to know everything that's going wrong. He just looked like a deer in headlights and reading these yelp reviews I now know why. 

They may get a false sense of hope with baseball starting soon but I highly doubt anyone will come to this place more than once so it's only a matter of time."}
{"text":"This place was hands down amazing.  I got the Ranger Nachos and they were right up there with the best nachos I've ever had in my life. The people I was with both got the double back and said they was impressive and their standards are high.  The prices were amazing. We will definitely be back a would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The lobster mac and cheese is NOT mac and cheese and tastes disgusting. Save your $17 and do NOT order it. Absolutely terrible. Also, don't do the beer card and self fill. It's at least 1/3 foam, and since you pay by the ounce, add on another third.
I was planning on hosting a large happy hour for work with all of our buildings and even thought of it for one of our large events. Not anymore, TERRIBLE food."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD !!! Got the hatch green chili burrito and  red chili pork burrito from food truck Taste of New Mexico. Best burritos I've had. Met chef from Taste of New Mexico he takes pride in his food very passionate about making his food right. Very authentic can't go wrong 

Venue is very nice, owners went all out to create a very relaxing cool environment. As with any bar opening minor issue will arise but it will all work itself out."}
{"text":"I only have a laundry list of negative things to say. This was not a pleasant experience for me to be a customer here. It's too bad. It has a lot of potential if customer service was better. I feel that management putting themselves in the place of a regular customer can fix that."}
{"text":"I honestly would give this place zero stars if I could. I came here for the first time tonight and the sign in front stated that we should seat ourselves, which is totally fine. We took our seats around 10pm. While we were waiting to be served, there were roughly 5 to 6 employees walking by and no one bothered to stop and ask if we needed anything; we were sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant, with no drinks or menus in front of us. It should have been obvious we hadn't been helped yet. We flagged down the manager, who smiled and told us she would find a server for us. She sent a young man over who said that the waitress assigned to our section was busy but he was going to find someone to help us. He finally comes back with a waitress who opened up with a passive-aggressive comment about how she wasn't supposed to be our waitress but because her co-worker was inefficient she was going to take care of us. (She even pointed out the lady who was supposed to be our waitress, who happened to be standing in the bar talking to the bartender). She explained the self serve beer system and said she would come back with waters and take our orders. 15 minutes later she finally comes back, but refuses to take our orders because she's supposed to end her shift. She turns around and leaves before we can even respond. There's another waitress who stops on her way to bus a table and says she'll be right back to take our orders. But she never came back. 

After this was all said and done, we had been here for almost an hour and had not gotten anything but the treatment of indifference and some free water. I guess they don't like making money or earning potential repeat customers."}
{"text":"Okay I literally never give a bad review. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt given that it's my first time in. This place is being run very poorly. You walk in and there is a seat your self sign. We met our family who was out of town, my father in law who is a restaurant owner to say the least. They had been sitting for at least 10 minutes before I had arrived and had not been given the beers they had ordered. I went to find a staff member, and spoke with the bartender. I told her no one has taken the rest of our drink orders and she in a very unfriendly manner told me we get it ourselves. Being that I'm in for the first time I didn't know we would grab our own sodas. And I was inquiring about actual alcohol drink service. She told me she would \"be right over\" and she continued to clear tables. Mind you this whole time the restaurant is slow, and they could get to clearing tables later. The bartender is not behind the bar and the only server they have, Anissa is running around helping others on her own. She took care of us, and was very friendly & kind and did her best to give good service. She ordered two Budweisers for us, and I watched the bartender pour two bud lights. My fiancé  went over and asked the bartender to fix the mistake. She gave the wrong beers away to guests at the bar for free? Which seemed odd since she made the mistake with us. Following that moment we were waiting for another round of beers, and as we're waiting the bartender is on the phone, and still hasn't seen our second round in their ticket system. It's a shame they have staff running a place this nice like this. I have to give all my credit to Anissa for any of our good service because she truly did a great job. The only suggestion I would have is to hire more staff, or at least hire a bartender who is a little more pleasant. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Tried \"The Park\" for the first time today. I liked the concept and found the environment fun and lively. I ordered the spam katsu plate lunch from the Hawaiian food menu. The wait for the food was quite long. I got my food to go and didn't have time to eat it during my lunch but when I got to it I noticed the food order was wrong. They served me the musubi bites. Which tasted alright ( I'm sure it would've tasted better if I had eaten it right away) and the portions were small. Besides the food being meh and getting my order wrong, the promos of live entertainment, live djs  and free uber rides to and from The park are appealing and enough for me to give this place a second chance. I'll come with my boyfriend to check out the night scene."}
{"text":"Second trip here. First one was terrible thought it was a fluke cause they were super busy. We were down town again and got here early hoping for a better experience, welp didn't happen. Service again was terrible, couldn't get my drink refilled after asking 2 different people one of which was our server. Finally got my order of wings which took over 25 min and they were literally ice cold on the bone, hardly any sauce and were worthless. Told my server who took them back hopefully I'll get hot ones this time. I won't be coming back and see why they have the rating they have."}
{"text":"The food was good. They have the biggest giant screen TV we watched the FIFA cup on it before the Dbacks game. I recommend the Elote and  the burgers. Makayla waited on us and did an excellent job. Huge selection of beer."}
{"text":"Was very excited to check this place out but was a bit disappointed. I get what they were going for but execution didn't match expectation. Below are positives and negatives...

Negatives:
-Can't order food and drink together. Had to wait in a line for food, then wait in another line for alcohol. 
-The self serve beer wall wasn't working
-Our server/cocktail waitress took over 15 minutes to check on our table to let us know she was covering our section
-NO SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS. What an odd issue to be faced with. Our chicken tenders were bland and we asked our server for salt & pepper to which she responded \"we actually don't have that.\"  
-For a place called The Park, I wanted more of the outdoors in. Other than the trees and a couple gas lamps the esthetic still just felt like a big sports bar. I think more natural light would have helped, maybe some park benches? Still fun look though. 

Positives:
-Whatever food truck had the tacos were great! Ordered a second round
-When the 2nd round of food came the head chef delivered it and asked for thoughts and opinions. Any establishment that takes constructive criticism I can appreciate. We told him about the salt issue, to which he said there was some at the napkin station. Once he left we checked, but still found no salt & pepper though. 
-Food truck concept is cool and gives me a chance to try multiple in one location
-Has potential. Just need to work out the kinks. 


Suggestions:
-Make sure staff is comfortable with proactively checking on patrons, not just waiting to be flagged down. 
-Get salt & pepper shakers... like a lot, not just one set."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  We sat and waited for the bartender lady with the nose piercing to serve us and she kept helping other people who walked up to the bar AFTER we sat down.  She even looked me right in the eye and ignored us.  Didn't even say \"I'll be right with you\" or anything.  When I finally said \"Excuse me\", she looked at me and rudely asked what can she get for me.  I asked about the special on the Ultras and she says \"we're out\".  I asked what other specials they had and she said, \"none, we don't have any on Sat.\"  We walked out and left and came to a taco and tequila place and got greeted and served right away.  Don't waste your time at this place.  I would give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun, the beer garden is a great idea but troubled with two issues. One, the beer is hot... They do have chilled mugs and glasses but the beer is still got. Number two, you pour four or five dollars worth of beer and 80% is foam. It would be much better to go to the bar, you would actually get your monies worth. As soon as this gets fixed, my rating will pop up to at least 4 stars. Don't waste your money on the hot beer garden. It's actually a hot foam garden."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! And not a hot mess at that.. as soon as my husband and I come in as first timers, we weren't greeted by anyone, we waited 15min before actually having to walk up to the bar and ask if we sit anywhere, bartender replied \"yes you can sit anywhere\". Then we sit and come to find out it's counter service and we order up front. All the while the manager of this establishment was watching us walk around confused. Then we proceed to order and my husband got the spam which was decent but let's be honest how can you mess up spam! Then I ordered carne asada tacos and the meat was disgusting, tasted like crock pot meat then carne asada. My husband also ordered the traditional wings and when we got it it was grey looking wings covered in buffalo sauce. Needless to say he ate one and was done. I've been a chef for over 13 years and work for a celebrity chef, Will Never Return To this Place! I'd give No Stars!"}
{"text":"Cool concept, great location, terrible service. Came here for date night. First, it's super confusing...do you seat yourself, where do you get drinks, order food, do you have a server??? Decided to sit at the bar to make it easier. Waited for the bartender to stop talking to another coworker and tried multiple times to make eye contact to order a drink. Finally after a good 15 minutes another bartender helped us. Waited another 20 minutes to order food and finally left empty handed. Can't comment on the food because we never had the opportunity to try anything. Wasted almost an hour for a lousy beer before going elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's an interesting concept with food trucks supplying the food and pay per ounce taps of beer and wine.  

Unfortunately as the Park employee said to me \"you're paying for all that foam\".   I'm not a professional bartender but I have poured a brew or two and this was an epic failure.  Good thing the employee was there to show me how to do it.  His pour had just as much foam.  I was there with three others and we all had foamy beers."}
{"text":"Don't come here on a busy night. We came here after hearing all the great hype for the Eric Church concert and to get a drink it took FOREVER. Please hire more bartenders for the busy nights. You all could have a great establishment but getting attitude from the busy bartender and not being able to get a drink in under 20 minutes is absurd."}
{"text":"The prices are too high, the portions are too small, and the service is terrible! Overrated, do not go unless you just want beer because you don't need a waiter for that and can serve yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The two \"Rainforest Café-esque\" trees remind me of my childhood, but then the alcohol and delightful libations thrust me back to adulthood and knowing that I am secure financially. That being said, the food here is great. The self serve craft beer garden is unique and super fun. Taste as many beers as you can... they even have draft wine! Sriracha wings are bomb-diggity-downright tasty. The servers here are fantastic, timely and friendly. Thanks Alyssa!!"}
{"text":"I came to The Park because I thought it was a cool concept and they took reservations.  The reservations isn't really that, its more like you go to the top of the list for when a table becomes available, so plan on waiting even if you've made one.  The tables are incredibly close together.  They put my party of 5 at a table for 4 and we got bumped into the entire night.

Now, I will give it to them that I was there on a very busy night.  Every table had someone at it, but if you are going to set your establishment up to hold that capacity, then you should also be able to manage that.  We waited over an hour for food.  Based on the number of other people around us complaining, sounds like that was what everyone else was experiencing too.  When it finally did come out, it was cold and dry.  I wasn't sending it back because at that point I was really hungry.  They also forgot one of the entrees for someone in our party.  Twenty minutes after the rest of us got our food, the burger still wasn't out.  It doesn't take 20 minutes to cook a burger.  There was no apology on behalf of the server.  We had to ask several times for it, and the server kept saying \"its coming\".  Eventually I told her we can't be expected to pay for it at this point in time, and to just go ahead and cancel it.  Clearly they didn't put it in because canceling it was no problem.  

If this is how this business is run, then I feel terrible for the servers there.  They are going to get stiffed on tips over and over again for things that might not be their fault.  Yes, I did tip, but it wasn't the 20% I usually leave!  I hope management figures out how to handle the type of crowd a busy night downtown brings.  I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went before the WWE event at talking Stick to grab some food. We ordered our food and soda so we didn't have to deal with the beer system. We were a little confused how it works since we never actually had a server come up to us besides a runner dropping off the food 20 minutes later. I had the 3 tacos which were so small I wouldn't pay on $1 each but they were $10 with the chips.  A bonus is that if you order a non alcohol drink, they had you a cup so you can go up and get refills as you please. I believe the cup is a little over $3. Another positive is that my wife ordered brisket that came with 2 large slices of bread and a side spicy mac and cheese. i was a little jealous since her meal was only a little more than mine but the portion size was more than double."}
{"text":"It was fun...BUT very expensive...pay close attention to the cost per ounce...to avoid some of the foam, dip the rim of your glass in the circle part provided in the drain..I'm not sure if it works or not I ask a guy doing it after my card was empty and that's what told me. A lot of little kids by the pour station.  A big room with fake trees."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant if you're downtown and looking for outdoor seating they have a beautiful patio. My husband had the seasonal beer which he  enjoyed and a cheeseburger. I had the California chicken sandwich, I was surprised it was very good, french fries where just OK...."}
{"text":"After my 3rd visit to this place, I had to show this place some love! My initial visit stemmed from a Groupon I purchased and not only did we get an awesome deal but their nachos with the red chili meat-BOMB, self-serve beer- BOMB, Lobsta Roll- BOMB, our serve and service- BOMB! Ever since the first time I came I always have to ask for our OG server Adina, she's actually what has my friends and I come back for more besides the alcohol lol. There's people that do what they need to do to fulfill their job but then there's people like Adina who literally go above and beyond to get the job done vast expectations! I literally watched this girl cover tables all over the bar and still manage to be attentive to us and provide awesome service. I've been to foofoo lame lavish restaurants a plenty and this girl with her AZ hospitality blows all those \"high end\" servers out the desert  THANK YOU ADINA!!! We'll be coming back for more as long as Adina is there and the beer keeps cold!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice. A few months ago, we were a group of eight. I think that both the food and service are very good. We had a group of 6 today for lunch and Amanda, our server, was very attentive. She had no problem giving us separate checks (all paid with credit cards). We will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Among the worst service I've ever experienced. Currently waiting over 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by wait staff. Had to go up to ask for menus, which I would have thought would be a hint that we'd like to order, but each waitress tends to other tables and ignores ours.
Have been here a few other times and also experienced less than stellar service."}
{"text":"I have read about this place on AZ Central and had been wanting to check it out. The only bummer thing was we missed the food trucks, as we arrived after 10 p.m. But they had hot dogs and nachos, which were delicious! I had the cranberry mule, which was amazing! I loved the band they had on Saturday night, who played a little bit of everything and engaged the crowd! I also was impressed by the self-serve beer/wine concept where you purchase a card and serve your own beer/wine, which allows you to avoid the lines at the bar. Very neat concept. I definitely plan to go back to this place. I enjoyed it much more than the Yard, as it was more laid back and they also had some games, like ping pong and such and was in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the place was empty which should have been a sign when we walked in. The server took our order and then disappeared. When we tried to find someone to get our drinks, there wasn't an employee in sight. We waited 20 minutes for our beers, 2 of which came as Bud Lights and we asked for Budweiser. Waited 35 minutes for food, one person in our party had to get their food to go so they could get back to work. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I by no means have high standards when I go to a 'bar' for food however I can say I was pretty disappointed. I would consider myself somewhat of a chicken tender connoisseur and the tenders at The Park was terrible. Overcooked, tough, flavorless. The beer battered fries had good taste however most were undercooked. I was pretty disappointed with the good. I also had a pretty lack luster experience with paying and their self serve beer taps. I opened a tab and because of that they keep your card and give you a 'Park' card. They couldn't figure out how to change my food to their own card and had to do a separate transaction with my visa. The venue is nice, something has to change though  '"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and good food. Service is very good. Location is excellent for events at Talking Stick Arena or Chase Field. Great vibe and incredible Theatre size TV screen!"}
{"text":"Do not come here when there's a concert downtown. These people have no idea how to staff. A local radio station encourages listeners to come here before the concert and they have 5 bartenders and 7 servers. I waited 25 minutes to get a corona in a bottle. It can't possibly take that much effort to open a bottle. 
No one should ever promote a large crowd in this place. I've watched enough Bar Rescue to know these people failed the Stress Test miserably. It's been an hour and I still don't have my food. At this rate I'll be leaving to go to the concert without eating."}
{"text":"Would absolutely not recommend this place especially for a happy hour.  First server had no idea what wines they had, served our appetizers with a dirty dish.  Appetizers tastes like they came directly from a microwaved box.  It was unbelievably hot in there.  To the point we were sweating profusely.  When we spoke to the mgr he was very dismissive and said \"they are working on it as it's going to be 108 this weekend\".  No apologies.  Place was fairly empty and now we know why."}
{"text":"If you want to be a \"scene\" type of bar, where the staff and patrons all think their shit doesn't stink....this is the place for you. Every single person on the staff minus Nicholas (one of the cooks) are complete assholes. If you are a new business in downtown/central Phoenix and you are trying to attract new business, I suggest getting a new staff because every single person my group came in to  contact with had different stories of how horrible the customer service was.  I've lived downtown for a long time, and I've never felt more threatened or uncomfortable by a team of security staff. Great concept, horrible, HORRIBLE delivery. And for as a female,"}
{"text":"Was in the downtown area for a conference, and had an awesome time here for dinner.  Annie seriously went above and beyond to work with our group.  We had a group that started with 9 and grew to 20 people.  She was able to juggle the drinks and random food orders with ease!  Several of the guests took advantage of the self serve wall of beer and had a blast sampling the  choices.  Great location, food and service!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to check out this place as the concept is awesome. Not sure if they are just trying to work through the concept or what, but everything was a flop. The beer wasnt pouring correctly, they were out of all the different foods, and what they had wasn't good."}
{"text":"They're getting 1 star, because 0 is not an option.  What a disaster!  We went there before the Eric Church show to get a couple drinks and some food for an event that they had been promoting with a radio station.  We finally sat down at our table, and didn't see a server for well over 30 minutes.  Finally the server came, we ordered a round of drinks and some food.  Drinks came another 30 mins along with a heads up that 2 of the 4 items we ordered for food (which were on the menu) they did not have.  We ordered a couple burgers, and moved on.  The two items that were ordered (the Poki bowl) came out a few minutes later, and the fish was rubbery and salty and didn't seem safe to eat.  We finally found the server again and asked for one more round of drinks and to close out so we could quickly eat and leave to the show before we were going to be late.  Another 30 minutes went by and still no food, drinks, or bill.  We talked to 3 different people and were trying to locate our bill, so we could pay and leave, and actually go somewhere else to get some food quickly before the show.  No one could help us locate our bill, so we left.  Never in my life have I tried to hard to pay, and received no help from the restaurant.  I don't plan on ever going back, and will discourage anyone I know from going there."}
{"text":"WOW what a disappointment today.  Stopped in at 11:30 am Sunday for a quick couple of beers and lunch before the 1:10 Diamond Backs game. Drink order was taken at 1140 and the first drinks showed up at 12:15.  35 minutes for 3 tap beers. The 4th drink was 10 minutes after that. Our food order was taken at shortly after our drink order. At 1220 we still had not seen any of our food and we asked for a manager and a gentleman said he could help us. We explained that we had to be at the game but 1:10 and he said he would expedite and work with us on the price. Delivered 1 of our 4 sandwiches and 1 order of appetizers a few minutes later and said he would only charge us for half the food. At 1245 we finally gave up and told him we had to leave. His response was to apologize and said \"even the Patriots have a bad day\".  The waitress was brand new and was very friendly and this was not her fault. Never did see the rest of our food order.  They were not busy and maybe this is why. Sure hope they straighten out the problems."}
{"text":"Super fun night! We were traveling with a huge group for a volleyball tournament. The place was packed and they still accommodated our large party late in the evening. The service was good  and the atmosphere was super fun.... the girls even had fun dancing and loved the DJ!"}
{"text":"Overall, I had a pleasant experience at the Park. It has a nice atmosphere and plenty of outdoor seating. Plenty of seating inside too. Lots of menu and drink options. 

I can't give this place more than 3 stars for a few reasons. First, it is seat yourself but there are both servers and a counter to order food and drinks. Overcomplicates things in my opinion. We didn't even know we had a sever until about 15 minutes into it. Second, the person who took our order told my dad and boyfriend that they could not order a regular pulled pork sandwich - only the pork sliders - despite the sandwich being on the menu. Apparently the food comes from different food trucks? Idk, again, felt overcomplicated to me. 

It's a great location so maybe if they simplified or streamlined the process I would go back. Until then, I'm going to patronize other downtown restaurants instead."}
{"text":"This is like my favorite spot to grab a drink with friends and watch a Game. Tons of tvs, the beer selection is awesome it's fun just trying them all. The back section fun too with their games. Our server was named adina I'm pretty sure and she was on top of things and making sure we were always good. I'll definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"We were so excited for this place to open but honestly it's been very disappointing. They are always out of something food wise and one of the bartenders told us she didn't know how to make certain cocktails so that made us feel really comfortable (eye roll).  I feel sorry for the food trucks that have their names on stuff here because I've had a couple of them outside of this place and they are great but this was not a good representation of any of them. Not impressed at all. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 0 was because of the LED tv. I'll likely take my drinking elsewhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place a good 3 hours before the Dbacks game started.  6 tables who sat down well after us, were served their meals waaay before us.  Our waitress was inattentive, dropped off our food and she never stopped by again even though she walked past us a few times.  Needless to say, the food is mediocre, the beer selection cannot be called \"craft\" if you have Miller light, bud light, etc on the list and the service is terrible even though they appear overstaffed.  I highly suggest you bypass this place until they can get their act together."}
{"text":"Don't come here on a night before a concert. The service was atrocious. It took me 45 minutes to get a jack and coke at the bar. The bartender knew I was waiting awhile and kept blowing me off for other customers. Waiting that long for a drink is beyond absurd."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, from the first teaser on Facebook over a year ago. The constant delays kind of took the excitement out of it for me and it fell on my list of 'to try' places. 

This past Saturday, I finally ventured out to check it out, for a friends birthday.

We arrived on a night there was a Rattlers game and a DBacks game, and it was still fairly dead. Off the bat, the air was either not working or not turned down low enough because it was uncomfortably warm throughout.

The back room was set aside for the party, which was nice because it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation. We opted to try the beer wall (which actually was beer, wine and 1 cider). In theory, this idea is awesome, in reality it takes forrrrreeeevvvveeeerrr to get the card and instructions from the one employee working this area. Secondly, we were thankfully warned not to choose wine from the wall, unless we wanted to pay $2.00 an ounce. Upon reviewing the wall, wine was indeed outrageously expensive, but the Angry Orchard was a reasonable .80 an ounce. This was perfect for me as I don't drink beer and didn't want an entire cider. The same issue arose when we opted to leave, it took 20 minutes of waiting in line to close the tab and return the beer wall card.

Overall, the vibe is cool, the concept is cool. But it just didn't wow anyone. Plus, when it's 115 out, I hope not to sweat inside."}
{"text":"Update, yep I get the terrible reviews now. Went back for a 2nd time, and had about the worst service ever. Also someone thought it was a great idea to have drunk people play with beach balls which inevitably get hit to your table and knock over your drink. 

Food is just okay, but will probably never be back after my 2nd experience. Frustrating because this place could be a great spot for downtown, but instead is a bro sports bar hang out."}
{"text":"We are in town for a conference and the bar is across the street from the Talking Stick Arena which my girlfriends and I were just at for a concert. This bar shouldn't be naive to crowds yet there is only one bar tender behind each of their two bars. We have literally been waiting at the bar for 35 minutes to try to get a beer. The only reason we continue to wait is the music is good and we would be waiting for a Lyft anyway. Hope it's better on other nights."}
{"text":"I would put a zero if I could. Epic failure...they advertised derby day and we came to watch the Kentucky derby and they didn't even have the race on....after asking the manager several times we finally got the races on but without sound....once the race was over they turned the sound on...unbelievable 

Service was extremely slow and inattentive  and scattered 

Good concept they just need to get it together"}
{"text":"Really a neat atmosphere but very poor service and good. The brisket had so much fat on it, I did enjoy the corn though. One of the individuals in our party didn't get her food until right before we were about to leave after numerous attempts to get her meal. They did take the meal off of the bill but still it was not a good experience. The restaurant has a lot of potential but just need to pay attention to its clients."}
{"text":"Came here before a Suns game for dinner and a few drinks.  The atmosphere is cool and I will say the fries were really good.  My wife had a chicken sandwich and the meat was really dry.  I had the brisket sandwich and that was really dry as well.  I'd come back for a drink or two but wouldn't order food"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed by this place.  Drinks are average...  nothing special but also not the cheapest.  The bartenders are nice and personable though, so you'll have that going for you, which is nice. 

The place seemed empty for a Saturday afternoon.  Maybe because they have a gigantic fake tree in the middle of the restaurant and the vibe comes off incredibly lame.  They have two bars, one seems to stay closed during the daytime and looks like the place converts into a club after 10pm.  Maybe that's why every part of furniture looked cheap and abused.  

It IS conveniently downtown though, so if you're coming out of a baseball game, you'll most likely have a place to sit here."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place, but I feel that it was advertised very differently than what it was, so I was ultimately disappointed. I imagined this place with multiple areas where you order your food and a nice outdoor feel. Instead, it was a huge area with TVs everywhere with brightly colored menus on the wall and you have to order your food from the bar.  Speaking of the food...it was reallyyy bad. I had the BBQ burger. It was dry, overdone and small for $13. My boyfriend had the spicy tuna flyers, which were basically a couple lumps of rice, hardly any fish. Not even a meal. The only good part I saw was the selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Came here after a Dbacks game. Was drawn in by the large fake trees inside which were actually pretty cool. Also I've heard of the self serve beer taps. 

I got a quick run down on how the beer taps work and the card system. I elected for a pre paid card ($8) because I only wanted to try it and have one beer. After the learning of the system I thought it was pretty cool. I was able to choose a beer, in this case locally brewed Pedal Haus Beer, and fill up per oz in a glass. I thought it was super cool because I had about 3/4 of a glass of beer and was able to get just under a half of another beer to finish out my $8 card. I love trying new beers and this system made it easy to do it. Plus when you put your card next to the tap there is a screen that displayed how much money you have left and you can watch it go down per oz. It was a cool idea. 

We didn't try any food this time but will next time. 

Overall The Park was a cool spot downtown. I liked the fake trees inside, makes it feel like you are hanging out under a tree in a park wasting and drinking. It's a different concept but I loved it a lot. We will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Visited \"The Park\" with some friends recently and not only was their beer selection amazing, but our server Kyle delivered amazing customer service and was very knowledgeable. Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, ran out of food with a limited menu, poor service, manager walking around in circles instead of taking orders"}
{"text":"My roommate and I came here looking for a nearby place to eat after watching the Dbacks game. Considering how busy the area was (due to the baseball game and concert happening), the restaurant was pretty dead. We sat ourselves and were helped soon after. The place itself was neat; there's a giant tree in the middle, a stage, arcade games and multiple bars. However, the food wasn't all that. I had ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, but wasn't too thrilled. The cheese sauce was pretty watery and almost had no taste at all. My roommate ordered the Street Tacos (carne aside and shrimp) and wasn't thrilled either. The only good thing we had was the Basket Of Fries we shared, partially because the dipping sauces were actually tasty. Also, there aren't any drinks listed on the menu (besides alcohol), so if you're looking for a soda, you have to ask. They'll give you a cup to go fill at their soda machine in the back... I thought that was a little unusual, considering I didn't want to keep walking back and fourth to my table if I wanted a refill..."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned to try this place after looking at the reviews but I am glad we gave it a shot. The place is huge and is confusing in it's set-up, that much is true. There is a full bar when you walk in and a beer by the ounce wall set up. There is a ping pong and shuffle board table and a ton of big screens playing sports. There are a ton of tables and a second bar on the other side. Service was a little wonky, it seemed like not everyone knew their sections. So, the concept is that the Park partners with four different food trucks and the menu is a mix of all four. The waiter recommended the brisket sandwich with green chili mac and cheese so I went for it. The brisket came pulled which was a bit of a surprise and was served with coleslaw on top. The brisket was flavorful but the sandwich definitely needed the bbq sauce that it came with to complete the dish. The mac and cheese was legit. My husband ordered the taco plate with green chili pork and fajita chicken. The chicken was super generic but the pork was delish and he loved the chips and salsa. They had happy hour until 7 with well drinks for $3 and beer for under $3 as well. The tacos were $7 and my sandwich was $11, both good value."}
{"text":"The ambiance to this restaurant was awful. The music was so loud even I the middle of the day. They have awful lighting that belongs in a night club not in a early dinner restaurant with a beer garden. The selection of drinks was awful. We were crammed into a small corner table that was meant for 2 maybe 3 people but they have it to us for a party of 5. We ordered overpriced drinks that essential had no alcohol content. Two of the drinks were the exact same when what was ordered was entirely different. We told the waitress that she brought out the wrongs ones and she had the audacity to argue with us over it before finally take it back and bringing out the correct drinks which were nowhere near the same color of the first set she brought out to us. And never even apologized for the mistake 
She proceeded to never check up on us until it was time for the check. She didn't even offer dessert. When they delivered our food the people who brought it out couldn't tell us what was what in regards to what we ordered they just set it down on the table and said the waitress would be by to sort it out and of course that never happened. Awful experience for a restaurant that is far overpriced and has horrible customer service and ambiance."}
{"text":"This place was awful! My husband and I waited over 20 minutes for drinks that never came and ended up leaving and going to the whining pig on the corner. They need more staff and seating."}
{"text":"Oh, how I longed for this place, and sadly, disappointed I was. 

I expected an \"outdoor feel\" as it has been advertised; it felt like a rainforest cafe except no talking animals (the best part of rainforest cafe.) There was one fake tree in the middle of the room, but I didn't feel like it was an outdoor bar. 

The \"food trucks\" were not aligned along the bar as I expected. A wall of a menu was behind the cash register where you could order different items from different trucks (ok, kind of cool). Unfortunately, the portion size appeared to be half of what I would get if I had ordered this from the truck itself. 

The bar wall concept is cool. You prepay for a card and can use the card to buy beer by the oz. samplers, pints, whatever. Not enough taps, and half were beers such as coors light, bud light, etc. Wamp waaaaamp. 

It's a new bar, so the servers weren't quite familiar with the menu. I'll let that one slide. 

Other notes: 
Parking is around, but be prepared that everything nearby is metered/pay lots. 

There is a patio that's per friendly! Yay! 

There is giant Jenga, ping pong tables, and other games. 

Anyway, I don't know how to end this one, but maybe you should leaf the park off your list."}
{"text":"I'm not picky or like to be mean but seriously the worst service I have ever received. From them not having any beer of the beers we wanted. To taking forever on our food. They brought out our appetizer 40 mins after we ordered with our food. This is not where you want to go for a good time. Also, the self serve beer has a funky taste. AVOID!!!!!! AT ALL COST!!!"}
{"text":"Came her with my wife for a Sunday afternoon dinner.  The beers they have on tap are fantastic.  I sat and watched football on their massive 17' big screen and drank beer for a couple of hours.  ROBERT, our waiter was awesome! I would highly recommend this as someplace to hang and watch a game."}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was awesome! It's different for a downtown Phoenix bar which is a nice change of pace. They have a self serve beer wall, bar games, both a dj and a band that played all kinds of music. Also they have chargers along the wall for people to use and charge their phones which was a huge plus since my phone was dying at the time. Pretty cool place to spend a weekend night at!"}
{"text":"We went tonight. It was the 2nd night it was open. The beer wall was broken (took 15 minutes to find someone to tell us) and the beer was stadium prices. 11 bucks for a beer is too much IMO. The food was meh except for the wings. The wings were AMAZING! I'm hoping that in a few months I can try it again and hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"Great day at the park. We had Kyle as our server and he was great. He made us laugh and made our experience amazing. We will be back and asking for Kyle. The atmosphere is amazing and the drinks are great. Love this place"}
{"text":"We tried coming here for the first time before a concert this past weekend. Had the worst experience ever! After being sat outside a food runner came over and told us our waitress had two tables ahead of us, but if we'd like to get drinks he will get that for us, so we ordered and to our surprise he never came back with them or came back to our table on top of that our server NEVER showed up either. We went up to another server asking if she could notify our waitress, she said she did and after waiting for over 45 mins we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took 30 minutes to get anyone to take our drink order. We were sitting at the bar and had to flag down a server to take our drink order because the bartender wouldn't give us the time of day. Ordered chicken tenders and pretzel bites, waited almost an hour and never saw the server again..... never got our food or a second round of drinks. Several other tables around us were all in the same situation.  Walked out and got food next door. Will never go back and will be surprised if this place lasts more than 6 months."}
{"text":"Kyle is amazing. Very attentive, aware, and entertaining. Great service n food. Great atmosphere and location"}
{"text":"Well its Sunday so maybe that's it but its a good name because you can park yourself there for hours before you get service. Acknowledgment isn't a word they know here. Had one watress. Must be a foto store because they just don't give a dam."}
{"text":"Several tries and the food has improved greatly!!  Love the BEER WALL concept, fun  atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Not the best first impression. I had been waiting for this place to open since November and was really excited about the concept but I was sorely disappointed. I had taken a friend to what I thought would be a hip night on the town spot but it was anything but hip, unless you're talking hip replacement. The music was like a bad wedding band and the drinks were crazy over priced. Double vodka soda was 17$ and the beer was all foam all the time. I get it, it's their first day so I might visit again but as of now this is a heck no from me"}
{"text":"What an awesome location... I can't wait to visit again. The service was awesome, the food options were great and did I mention, THEY HAVE SELF-SERVE BEER. What a great concept. Here's how it works: 
1 - Get an RFID card from the staff
2 - Pour a taste of what you want
3 - Drink at your own pace
4 - Pay for whatever you consumed by the ounce

You gotta check this out. What a great location!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place before a DBacks game .. 

Cool interior space.. huge storage container houses a pour your own beer station.. and a giant tree in the middle of the room

We were seated quickly and our water arrived .. our waitress took our order and delivered one of two beers ordered.. five.. ten minutes go by and the second beer doesn't arrive.. when we asked about it she said the bartender forgot and he was getting it ready for her (huh..) .. several minutes later still no beer.. no apology, no checking on us, she just ignored us 

Food arrives and it all looked and smelled delicious .. I had the BBQ pulled pork w/pub fries .. the pickles and jalapeño rings def added to elevate the flavors .. my bf had the cowboy burger and he thought it was good.. a friend ordered a burger and subbed out the beef for a veggie burger for an extra $1. ..

The waitresses assistant (Kathy) kept the water refills coming and cleared dishes .. our waitress barely checked on us .. only to ask if we were ready for our check ..

My bf said he wouldn't come back .. food was good but service was slow .."}
{"text":"Fun, unique atmosphere. Very different concept, they are going for a beer garden indoors and I love the trees and music and unique feel to this place. The server said they are in flux with the menu, they had guest food trucks in the kitchen and now have a menu that seems more set but it was a little lacking. We had several items. The person who got the grilled cheese made out the best. it was amazing and we were all jealous of it. The nachos were not good. The cheese tasted plasticky and the meat on it was not hot. The beer and drink selection is great and the fill your own section looks interesting. We had a great view of the diamondbacks game going on and service was fantastic. I would be very excited about this place if the food gets just a little better. The drinks were reasonable. I think it was $8 for a 19 ounce on a game night so we didn't feel ripped off at all like some places around that double prices on game night. They have live music and we will be back after more games to check it out."}
{"text":"Food was not good, had brisket nachos the meat tasted like liquid smoke.. the beer glasses were not very cold and the selection of beer not so great. I could not stay there for a long time it was soooo hot and the bathroom was worse. I am definitely never going back. Positive- I did get a Pedal Haus beer pint when I bought a beer"}
{"text":"Was unfortunately very disappointed with my first visit to this place. I was excited to check it out after all the advertising I saw, but it did not live up to expectations. The staff, maybe because they're all new, really didn't seem to know what was going on. Bartenders didn't know beer on tap, and the beer machines were broken with no signs, just left us standing around waiting to find out on our own. We ordered food off the menu and after paying found out that they were out of the ingredients for our entire order. They were nice enough to refund but even that took a painfully long time. Hopefully once this place is open for a little bit longer, things will start to look better."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it cover.

Based on the well design, nice DT location, and excitement people talked about \"The Park\", my friends/Coworker and I were really excited to try this restaurant. However the moment we walked in we were already having issues with the restaurant. 

The hostess was confuse, our waitress ditch us (and started helping other people while we waiting almost 20 minutes for her to come back, but she never did), the people working the food didn't know their own menu, which lead us to pay full price for drinks during happy hours, and the food was too expensive for the cheap/poor quality that it was worth. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"The only positive thing about this place was the customer service. Aside from that, the food is horrible. We ordered the buffalo wings, the poutine fries, the tacos and, carne asada nachos. The buffalo wings were overly salted and when we complained about it the server was nice enough to order a different batch for us. Unfortunately, it almost seem like she brought back the same one because they were just as salty as the first batch. The tacos we're so ridiculously small I thought it was play food at first and when I actually ate one, the small tortilla was harder than a chip and stale. The poutine fries were also overly salted. Finally the carne asada nachos not only did it not have carne asada (they came with pork) but the cheese was so cheep I could almost swear they made them with velveeta. For the prices they're charging for the dishes, you would expect to have better quality. When we complained the second time, the waitress was nice enough to bring not only who I believe to be the manager but also the chief. And when we explained everything, he told us that it's supposed to be like lunch truck style food. I then explained to him that I have eaten from lunch trucks and their food was much more superior and cost cheaper than what they were charging and serving us. He then went on to say that all the ingredients and recipes they use are the same as the lunch trucks.  Tossed around what are suppose to be famous cooks names like it would make it better that it was their recipes. I've eaten at many different places and not once have I had food so overly salty and poor quality.  It was so bad that it felt like we might be getting pranked on a hidden camera show."}
{"text":"Kyle is the best!! He is a blessing from the lord Jesus Christ!! Ask him to serve you!"}
{"text":"Very slow service for not very good food.  Good service and not a terrible space, but the food is lacking."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the Park yesterday (Sunday) to celebrate our birthdays--mine is a milestone this year. We didn't have any food, but Rico the bartender took care of us. He makes the best hurricanes! I wanted to be on an island for my birthday, but since that wasn't going to happen, I did the next best thing--island cocktails. And if that wasn't enough, my friend told Rico my favorite band is Bon Jovi, and got him to play my favorite songs. Thanks Rico for making my birthday celebration special!"}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are looking for good service. The waitress forgot our order twice and then apologized saying she was \"flaky\" today. We then said just get us something that's quick, we had Mercury game tickets. She agreed and then proceeded to slowly clean the next table. If you've forgotten drink and food orders, wouldn't you go straight to the kitchen and place the order? A good waitress would. Food comes and good luck finding someone to bring you utensils. You complain to manager and he acts like he cares somewhat. After eating we couldn't find anyone to bring the check. Then no one to take it. I never have done a review like this, but this places service stinks. 
On the way out I say to the manager how horrible it was and he says \"bye, have a nice day\". Wow.
And to top it off...45 minutes late for the game. Damn shame, was looking forward to a new place near the stadium. Never again."}
{"text":"Great concept, terrible execution. The self serve taps turned off after hitting a nebulous limit that was never explained to me or my group. There was a mysterious \"beer warden\" that was apparently supposed to assist, but was nowhere to be found, and when I asked to be reimbursed the money on my self service beer card, they initially refused for...reasons? The beer selection was solid, and the food looked good, but all the people near us took forever to get food, and the staff was only helpful when they were taking my money. I would go back, but only of they resolve several issues."}
{"text":"Ended up here after the Urban Ale Trail. It's pretty cool with the beer wall and games in the back. Our server Alyssa was sweet and attentive. All our food came out hot and timely. I couldn't help but notice the main dining room looks like a great space for a dance floor of you were to clear out all the tables! Would love a 2-step night there since most the music they were playing was already country!!"}
{"text":"I received an offer for a $5 appetizer  which turned out to be a really good deal because the appetizers in this place are priced up to $25.  Their whole menu is pricey.  Anyway, I invited my husband here for lunch on a weekday, my office is nearby.  We were one of only two tables of diners in the place and it took about 15 minutes to get our order taken, then about 30 minutes to get our food.  Don't go here if you're pressed for time for lunch.  Our food was fair to average in taste with no flair.  On another occasion I visited this place for a beer after work with co-workers.  Luckily the service was faster, the beer was a good deal and it was cold.  My summary is this this place isn't a good bet for a meal, but not bad for drinks."}
{"text":"We went last night before an event at Talking Stick. Sat down at 7:08, ordered a beer. The server didn't return till after 7:20 to inform us that they were out of what we ordered. Ordered other drinks... we left by 7:38 since she never returned. I had always looked forward to trying this place, I like the concept. But was severely disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the park. We needed food after the game and this place was perfect. The food was good, we had the sampler platter, I had a bloody Mary and my kids got a Brownie in a cast iron skillet with ice cream. The service was great! I think the ambiance is pretty cool and would be perfect for birthdays. I'm always looking for places that can accommodate at least 25. They have a nice room in the back as well. I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Should have looked at reviews before coming here. Cool beer garden, but thank you for being out of everything we ordered except water. The food we did order was alright, service was alright , overall poor"}
{"text":"Cool concept and well put together place but service is terrible! Sat for 20 mins with no one greeting us. Eventually stopped a server to ask for for food menus. Waited another 10-15 then ordered at the bar because I was tired of waiting. If it wasn't for the hockey playoffs I would have just left way earlier."}
{"text":"We were there Saturday August 26th, 2017 evening and they were extremely under staffed.  We checked in at the hostess station and were told 15 mins. People we not checking in and sitting down at tables. Management was clueless. Took 50 mins to get a table and we never got our food after waiting an additional 40 mins."}
{"text":"First time visitor, decided to check out before suns game. They had a good variety of self serve beers on tap but only 1 porter. I did like the pay per ounce aspect. 

Service was spot on!!! 

They had shuffle board and a ping pong table, which turned out to be really fun.

Unfortunately I didn't try any food but looked delicious"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. AMAZING! 
How do you have a picnic indoors? This is the question that drove The Park's design, creating a spot for the locals of DTPHX. And even though summer is a few month away, The Park is here to help us with beer-food truck invasion.
The Park has an eclectic menu from a variety of food trucks. Currently they are sporting 5: Hawaiian, BBQ, Fries, and Tacos - as guest menus - and The Park menu as their standard. We ordered the poutine fries \"mashed potatoes on the inside, tater tots on the outside\" as the Chef himself said,  the Spam Musubites, and pulled pork sliders. Each chef has a different specialty and many of them have even trained under Bobby Flay! The flavors of everything were so delicious, we ate it up in two seconds! 
Now here is the thing that I have never seen  ever and is probably the coolest part of The Park- attention beer lovers!!- they have a self serving beer garden! Here is how it works: you get a beer card, you fill it with money, you go up to the self serving beers and place your card on it, you fill up with your choice beer and it automatically deducts from your card! Technology and beer?! Amazing! It brings new meaning to BYOB - here it's Be Your Own Bartender!
On top of that, the ambience is so open and inviting. There are large trees to mimic the outdoors, live music up on the stage, and two bars in addition to the self serving bar.
I absolutely adore the creativity of this place and encourage everyone to check it out!"}
{"text":"Was honestly very excited about the concept of The Park - food trucks coming together in one place with a wide variety of beer on tap (great for lazy people who love trying new food). I was very disappointed. I really wanted to like this place but I couldn't. The different kinds of food you can get here: BBQ, Mexican, Seafood (lobster), Hawaiian and cupcakes. I was very interested in the Hawaiian food so I ordered the Poke Bowl (1/5 star), chicken katsu plate lunch (2/5 stars) and the Spam Masubites (3.5/5 stars). Yeah, the food wasn't that great. I would come back and try the other items but I don't have high expectations at all for the other items on the menu. 

Other than that, the restaurant was huge with a lot of seating options. I LOVED how there were a bunch of outlets all around the table and they even had multiple iPhone chargers. I was able to revive my phone from 11% to 55% while eating. Also, the service was great. Two people checked in with my table to see if we needed anything so that was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by the rating of this place! I came here during the day on a Saturday and it was pretty dead. The beer wall they have here is a super neat concept; you get a preloaded beer card that you can use on the self-pour taps, which charges the beer card depending on the beer and how many ounces you pour. This is a great option if you're wanting to try out an assortment of beers without the commitment. They also had a couple of wines on tap which was interesting, but they were way more expensive per ounce than the beers. A majority of the beers were craft beer - some local. I don't know how often they rotate the taps but they have plenty right now! Warning if you're coming here: a lot of the taps caused a lot of foam while pouring the beer. So be careful!

The food was also on point. Six of us split the beer fries and brisket nachos and we all loved everything. I love the interior of this place and how cool of a hangout it is!

Only downside is the parking situation. You're in downtown Phoenix, so be prepared to pay for parking. 

Otherwise, it's great! Check out Groupon for The Park for some great deals before you go!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. They were out of all popular beers. Our appetizer came out after our main entre. The food is was not that great. Especially for the amount of time we waited to even get our food. The place looks awesome but other than that. No bueno. Disappointment."}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game and good food! Ahi Tuna Street Tacos were tasty! Really neat inside, and lots of TVs. Service was on the slow side"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! We stopped in on an early Saturday night 9pm, there were maybe 25 people in the bar and we for the life of us got absolutely no help for like 25 minutes even after asking a waitress for menus, she just stood there and watched us look around for help and helped others around us but literally refused to help us!

The server who did end up helping us was great! But honestly, I would not go back. The food was sub par, the taps are nothing but foam no matter how much you \"tilt\" your glass and the music was extremely loud for how dead the place was...

Skip this place! Much better options downtown than this place!"}
{"text":"First walked in and no one greeted us. Then sat down, people who came in after us were seated and served. Kept trying to get someone's attention to get served, for 15 minutes. Eventually left. Horrible service will never go back."}
{"text":"First time visiting the Park and loved our experience! The food was great and the beer wall concept was a lot of fun and very convenient! They give you a card and you have 29 beers to choose from, your charged by what you drink so if you feel like a half glass go for it! Our server, Alyssa, was fantastic and took great care of us, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. I went in for appetizers and drinks with friends about a week ago, and to be honest I probably won't return. The bar itself looks cool, very sporty and cool decor, however halfway through our evening a DJ set up and was blaring music. Mind you it looks like a sports bar, and there were like 15 people in the place. If you looking for a cool bar to visit with friends, where you can hear each other, this is not the place. It was like they were trying to make it into a nightclub and it wasn't sticking. The food was fine, drinks were fine, but my bill was 60+ for mozzarella sticks, fries and 3 well drinks. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Karen the hostess and our server Makayla were great!!! We can't wait to come back. Such a fun place."}
{"text":"This is my third time here... I swore after the last time that it would be the last. The people I work with downtown are having a going away party for lunch and made a reservation for 16. We are still waiting for some of the orders to come out and have been here for an hour and 15 minutes. DO NOT COME HERE the food is mediocre and the service is appalling."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! First issue was could not get a card to use the self-serve beer station. They hold your ID so you return their card. They LOST my ID and I was only there an hour! They fail to tell you there is a \"responsibility limit\" on the self serve beer area it cut us off after TWO full beers! We asked for a refund and that was a huge fiasco as they did not want to do it! Oddly enough, when I asked how much money they suggested for 2-3 beers and I planned on staying for an hour, they told me $20-$25! No mention of a \"responsibility limit\". That is a crucial part of the self serve beer that they need to mention, especially if they don't plan to refund customers once they've hit their \"limit\". They need to train staff and execute their concept much better. No one showed us how to use the self-serve station and trying to locate an employee to help was an impossible task. This place will not last. Been open a month and it was dead at 5pm opening day of NCAA tourney."}
{"text":"This place could honestly be great, but for a few things which lead to my 2 star rating. I have gone twice now and the beers are flat. They have a beer garden but me and my boyfriend both had different beers with same flat taste. Almost like watered down. 

Service is also pretty terrible. Younger servers are often found on their phones rather than doing their jobs. We waited for a solid 20 minutes for the server to get us our bill and she never returned. We had to hunt her down and found her outside on the phone. 

Cool environment and cool DJ and dance floor but awful service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be a great downtown dining spot. There are a couple of big concerns that need to be addressed before this can happen. 

First the good:

The Beer Wall: This self-service beer station is such a cool concept. You obtain a beer card that you then use to pour yourself a pint. Along the wall are a number of spouts with a number above them. At the top of the wall is a list that describes what each number is. There is an array of cheap beer, craft beer, cider, and wine. 

What's cool is that if you just want a sample, you can pour whatever amount you want and you get charged by the oz. 

Issues begin: 
Beer: depending on what beer you pour, there's a heavy head of foam. 

Food: we ordered two dishes- the street tacos and the spinach dip. The street tacos were pretty good, but pricey for what they are. The spinach dip was more cream than spinach. I'd pass on that. Overall I was less than impressed with the food. 

Service: a mix of good and bad. You can tell that the general manager who is walking around and talking to people is trying his best to keep the place running smoothly. But when it takes almost ten minutes for a host to take you to your seat in a relatively quiet restaurant, it leaves a questionable impression. 

The waitress was pretty good, but lacked the intuition that makes for great service. Menus were down, eye contact was made. Nevertheless, she had to be waved down a few minutes later from where she was chatting to a coworker in order for us to place an order. 

With all the other restaurants in the area, it'll be some time before I try this place out. Maybe by then, they'll have fixed a couple of the kinks."}
{"text":"I wish I could have eaten here, but on a weekend with The Suns game, The Diamondbacks Opening Day, the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament and concerts, and the Pride Festival, they only had two servers working :("}
{"text":"Walked in.  Sign says \"Seat Yourself\". 10 people in bar/dining area. 4 different waitstaff walk by us as if we are invisible. We wait almost 10 minutes and not once did anyone even offer us a menu. Wow. Looked like a cool spot. Guess we will never know."}
{"text":"This from the outside seemed to be promising for a place to grab a drink and some food before a game.  DEAD WRONG!!!  This place whilst having a okay atmosphere was incredibly overpriced.  We stayed long enough to see our plastic cup dos XX were seven, yes seven dollars, a piece!  Holy cow!  Service was okay, but not prompt.  Red flag warning should have been miller lite and bud lite special was five dollars.  Our mistake, will not be returning."}
{"text":"The service was HORRIBLE! Just terrible! Slow. Like molasses. The only thing that helped was that the bartender stepped in to greet us and let us know he'd be ready to help us in case no one comes by. I wish he'd been our server!! The food was just ok. (I was REALLY hungry)! Waited over 20 minutes for our check. We finally flagged down a different server just to get the bill. Portions are good sized. The layout and decor don't make any sense and nothing is cohesive. This place could be fantastic but nooooooo. I'm really bummed! Hopefully they will get better severs! Even out check didn't have an actual bill - just the credit card slip. I won't come back at all again."}
{"text":"Went into an empty restaurant (should have been enough to tell me to leave right then) during lunch hour and our order was rudely and ineptly taken by Felicia, she didn't even know what salad dressings the restaurant had to offer. She got our order wrong then had a terrible attitude when we requested it be corrected. Ridiculous. Even after requesting wings be cooked well, they came out raw in center. Had to ask for refund. Will not go back after Felicia and raw wing combo. WAYyyy too many great choices downtown to waste time and money here!"}
{"text":"Love the soup and salad combo! Great food and fun servers!  Thanks Kyle"}
{"text":"I live in Chandler but my lady and I like to discover new places to enjoy dinner and live entertainment ...Last night we stopped in @ The Park new place down town Phoenix...it was great, food was off the hook and the service.. the lady that took care of us was on her job...as well as she was a very nice person also...My date had the chicken and waffles and I went for the pulled pork dish and it was finger lick'n good...I will be back and tell all my friends...Parking they do have under ground parking that you can get validated...But Live Music only on Sat...."}
{"text":"Don't think I will be back.  Cool concept, but total miss on service.  Had to ask 2 separate people to track down my server, the server didn't had to make 2 trips because they didn't know what they carried, and now I am waiting almost 30 minutes for a burger that I will have to devour in order to make the comedy show across the street.  I think that combined with the managers indifference when another person in our party provided respectful feedback on the amount of sun coming into the seating area and how shades might be a good add really left me with a bad taste.

Wait, wait!  The waitress just came over and told me sorry there is a long wait, told me there is a buffet I can order from instead of what I ordered.  I cancelled the order, like the group next to me.  Oh well, I will order at Stand up Live, and go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars with over 180 reviews should've been a bright red flag for what to expect from The Park. 

This review is solely for any of you who care about professionalism and respect for one's own words.

I was in town for a conference Jan 20, 2018 and needed to book a place for a team dinner. We fully understand accommodating a large group of 50+ is difficult for any restaurant, let alone a restaurant in downtown! I would never give never give a bad review for poor or slow service from the front of house or kitchen staff with such a group. I understand - it's hectic and hard. So this review is not based on the service. 

We made the reservation and even confirmed day of for our group of 70 for 7:30PM. When we arrived at 7:15PM, the hostess and asst manager Robert rudely let us know they decided to cancel our reservation. They decided it wasn't in their interest to honor a guaranteed group of 70 paying customers (that was already in their books). Robert's reasoning was because they wanted to give the tables to a few walk-in groups coming at the same time. 

So, I wish I could review the service or food or beers or ANYTHING ... but the management never gave us the chance.

It's no surprise why this place has such poor reviews."}
{"text":"Wack! Drinks are horrible and they don't even have beer cards for their self serve bar"}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place and counted down the days til it opened. Unfortunately the excitement didn't last...

The extremely loud live music kind of ruins the setting. \"The park\" name paints a slightly different picture than really loud music. Don't get me wrong, I love music. But every time I've been there I'm annoyed more than anything. 

The food is okay.

They seem to often not have any idea what's going on. I been sent email/text promos, brought them in, and then no one working there knows how to use it. 

I hope it improves. It was a great idea."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for some beer and food prior to a Dodger game. Ordered a beer and it was not very cold. I like beers that are very cold, they taste better that way lol. My food was kind of dry, had the bbq chicken wrap.. Waiter was kind of slow but manager made up for it and waited on us. Good vibes though, even after all that, I'll still go back for a drink."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for the longest time because of the self-serve beer idea. It sounded like a magical place where people gather, and the beer flows from waterfalls...however that is not the case. 

1. The taps are shit and immediately nullified our main reason for coming. You get charged for the amount of time you pull them, no matter how much beer actually comes out, and it's about 90% foam. One of the taps was actually empty and charged us around $15 when all it did was sputter. We notified a server who gave us a new card, but it was for $14 instead of checking how much we were actually charged for the error. They will say people don't know how to pour, but that's not true. Keg parties were my unofficial major in college. Everyone using the self-serve was laughing about how much of a joke it was.

2. The servers were not attentive. When we arrived, it was \"Please Seat Yourself\" and not busy at all. We went straight to the beer wall and waited several minutes before someone got us set up. Then we walked around to figure out where to sit. First we tried the patio and then moved inside. It was probably 15 or more minutes before a waitress made eye contact with us and came over. Most of the time, they are standing around talking to each other under the giant tree or by the soda machine. Food didn't take very long to arrive. We were waiting forever between times where we'd see our server, so I asked for our bill and some waters. She came back with just the bill.

3. Food was ok but nothing to rave about. I had a sampler, and my wife had the satay chicken skewers. The sampler needs a side of ranch to go with the buffalo wings.

4. We were trying to watch the Rams vs. Falcons game, but 2 douchey millennials came up on stage to sing and play their guitars during the game. It wasn't just during commercials or timeouts...it was during the game. We got the hell out of there."}
{"text":"Really, really lame. Downtown Phoenix has gotten so much life over the past few years, but this place doesn't measure up. The beer selection is pedestrian, the staff was unorganized and confused. It feels like an advanced version of TGI Fridays. The background music was even lame. This place is the Nickelback of downtown. The only reason I didn't go 1 star is because I didn't try the food, so perhaps that would make a difference."}
{"text":"Good place to stop in before and after an event. The main area for dining seems to be understaffed. It's a cool environment, Rico was a friendly bartender and took time to show us the self serve taps. The food we ate were the street tacos shrimp and carne asada were above average but the wait was long. We will return and try out the self serving beer tap"}
{"text":"So I haven't actually been here, but I live across the street and just read this week's Dirty Dining section put out by CBS 5 News. This place had like 5 violations. Gross."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been here,  nice environment but bad service.   It took 10 minutes for a server to attend me,   I told her that I had been waiting for 10 minutes and all she said was that she was helping another table,  not even an apology.  Even though she past by me around 10 times,  she could have at least greeted me and said that she would be right with me but not even that."}
{"text":"Interesting concept worth checking out. Over complicated with ordering and the pour your own beer is cool if the kegs are not pouring foam. You end up paying full price for half a beer. Luckily our server got us a beer from the bar free of charge. Was expecting more of a laid back feel, but it's basically your standard sports bar."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe and atmosphere of this place, BUT the service is absolutely horrible. It took 20 minutes to get appetizers when the server said it would be 2-3 minutes."}
{"text":"The Park has a lot of potential! Very cool concept & it's ideal for grabbing a drink or food before a game downtown. However, after multiple visits, I've only had two servers that were attentive and created a positive experience. During my last visit, I sat at the bar & the bartender was incredibly rude- not only to her fellow staff members, but customers as well. I overheard her speaking negatively of a few members, which is completely unprofessional in front of customers that can hear every word you're saying. Aside from her cruel comments about servers, she was completely dismissive of customers as well & the way she treated a man ordering a to-go meal broke my heart. Hope nobody else has to experience anything of that sort when they go to The Park!"}
