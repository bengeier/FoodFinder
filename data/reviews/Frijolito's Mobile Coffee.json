{"text":"Tried the vanilla cinnamon iced coffee and it was smooth  and just a perfect blend.  They catered at a party I attended and it was great service.  I can highly recommend them.  Wish they served In Texas!"}
{"text":"Tried the Elixir de Amor and it was Super velvety.   What a perfect night for some delicious  HOT coffee!!!  Frijolito's you guys have the best coffee in So Cal  Thank you"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a delicious Mariachi Latte. Loved it! Can't wait until next week to get it again. Priscilla ground the beans fresh right in front of me."}
{"text":"I've been looking for delicious coffee ever since I moved from Phoenix and had to give up my beloved Dutch Bros. I've tried every coffee shop in my area and imagine my surprise when the best coffee in town is from a truck! Coconut latte is to die for, banana latte is amazing too. If they ever open a storefront location I might be the #1 customer! Finally good coffee in OC. Thank you frijolitos!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing I love more than a coffee truck! Mexican coffee was tasty. Fantastic service as well!"}
{"text":"Omg having them at work on Friday mornings helps me get through the day! Such a great sense of humor and contagious laugh. Recommend the mariachi loco with an extra shot"}
{"text":"This adorable little van showed up at the Porsche California Festival of Speed this weekend.  The owner is a bubbly, warm, spirited woman who takes great pride in her products and service and instills the same in her employees.  And it shows:  they made the single best latte I've had in the last year!  WOW, please come back next year!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee and Mexican hot chocolate I've ever had. Made by some of the nicest people I've ever met! This truck is worth tracking down!"}
{"text":"I got to try their coffee at the LA Street Food Fest at the Rose Bowl. Their iced mocha & iced coconut latte was perfectly sweetened. I missed their iced horchata coffee."}
{"text":"Had Frijolitos for a Breakfast Food Truck event this past weekend and it went really well! They arrived on time, set up quickly and in an organized fashion, their baristas were very friendly, and their little van was great! The menu had a variety of items to choose from and Priscilla came up with a great idea for our first 50 guests! Huge hit! Thanks to Frijolitos for a seamless event."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!!! Better than any Starbucks I've ever had. Quality is amazing!! They are mobile and can come to your worn in the morning!"}
{"text":"Mariachi Loco Iced Coffee... YUM.  Much better than anticipated, but I didn't know they had dairy-free until I looked at other reviews. :/  I love how my first few sips included chunks of gritty cinnamon deliciousness.  Reminded me of something Salvadoreño.  Please come back and visit us in Santa Ana!  Gracias!"}
{"text":"Coffee is soooo awesome !!! And the service is great , these guys are great. Its been awhile since ive had GREAT coffee , glad i came tonight"}
{"text":"Hands down best coffee and a non shop!  The expresso machine is so cute! And the drinks well those are a WHOLE different story! Mariachi Loco is so good! Don't mind if I do with a extra shot or 2 ! Keeps me going and my tastebuds satisfied !   The crew is so sweet and all have great personalities! It's more of a mobile family coffee shop then just a coffe shop on wheels! Love it! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love this truck! The coffee is amazing, and they have so many unique flavors! I had the Coconut Latte and it was delicious! They also have non-dairy options which is nice if you're vegan or lactose intolerant."}
{"text":"Como siempre digo esta pinche gente vendiendo de una troka siempre kieren vender caro alos pinches gueros.....pero gente Latina no esta dispuesta a Pagar caro por algo q savemos lo q vale. Y Los q van a gastar sus dolaritos como pendejos en lugares como estos estan haciendo ala vieja rica para q Ella vaya y gaste su dinero en depilaciones vaginales en Los mejores lugares de Phoenix jajajajaja vayase ala verga yo gasto no dos dolares en una taxa de cafe"}
{"text":"Let me just say Prisilla is the most pleasant person I have met in a long time, if you see her just say HI, even if you don't want any coffee. Love love this cafe on wheels. I have tried the Coqui - perfect blend of vanilla, coconut and espresso, the coconut is very light but enough to compliment the vanilla. The mariachi loco is another favorite (very similar to horchata except this comes with espresso), a few of my friends are hooked on this one. I just recently tried the spanish fly, it was a little on sweet side for me. Only two sizes to choose from 16 or 24oz.  There are still a lot on the menu I need to try. I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"The Horchatta Latte was the bomb.com. It was very sweet-just the way I like it. I was impressed that they could heat the drink up to 180 degrees. Most coffee companies don't have the type of expresso machines that can heat a drink to a specific temperature. I hope to see this truck in my area soon!"}
{"text":"Un café  de 5 dls!!!! Encontré  la camioneta del café, compré  uno mediano y casi lo escupo cuando me.cobraron 5 dólares por un pinche café de cafetera, o sea que no lo acababan.de hacer, era del reposado. En fin, el.sabor del café decente, los precios sobrevalorado, ni que fuera café chiapaneco.recién molido"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! The drinks, the staff and the service! They're at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest every Sunday for 6pm service. We've permanently changed our service time to Sundays at 6pm just for this coffee! I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I LOVE the Frijolito's iced mocha! I look forward to enjoying it while enjoying service every weekend! Price is beyond fair! If I have the $, I'll always put more in than they ask. Yes, it's that good! If you want to try real coffee, you've gotta check this place out! I will NEVER step foot in a Starbucks again. There's no reason to when I can be supporting local business that truly puts love in every cup, hot or cold! Thank you for being at Saddleback! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"Man this was a life saver they come to my work, in a time of need I got the horchata latte is was bomb thanks guys ill be looking for you guys on the road....."}
{"text":"The menu is divine and so welcome during the antique market we visited over the weekend. The two women running this little rolling slice of heaven have the coffee thing down so well, we went back for seconds. The only thing we'd like to see is a low-cal or sugar free option since so many of us would like to go the \"skinny iced coffee\" route. The coffee drinks are sweet, indulgent and priced comparably to those of that mega-store Seattle based chain."}
{"text":"Saw this truck at the Patchwork Festival and there was a huge line.  Initially, I thought it was ridiculous to wait that long for coffee, but had to try it out.  It was worth the wait.  Seriously, one of the best coffees I've ever had.  It's be better than Starbucks.  My wife loved her hot chocolate.  Too bad they don't have a brick & mortar shop."}
{"text":"I LOVE FRIJOLITO'S!! They've been coming by my work in Irvine and everytime I find out they're here it's a MUST that I get my fix. My favorite is the Mariachi Latte I think it's called... the one that's like horchata! SOOO GOOD!! And Priscilla the owner, she's so much fun! Her personality is amazing, so full of life and that just puts the cherry on top! I follow them on FB and IG, and would follow them everywhere if I didn't work, have kids and could just drink coffee all day! LOL"}
{"text":"Always in a great mood.  Their iced coffee's are the best.  Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"The best mobile coffee! Too many flavors to choose from! Definitely a must try if you follow them on twitter and FB!"}
{"text":"Had the mariachi loco (horchata latte) and it was great! Very light and not too bold. Very refreshing. Awesome family!"}
{"text":"Frijolito's swings by my workplace every Tuesday, and they put together a sexy menu, so I gave them a shot today.  16oz of Americano later, the Cuban 50% of me feels ready to fight a rhino.  Really smooth roast, and actually pretty cozy on your stomach, too.  (Also, I don't care what diet you're on - if you say no to $2 sweet bread, you are an agent of the Dark Lord and cannot be trusted.)  The crew is awesome, too.  Friendly, prompt, and (gasp!) made of cool, interesting people.  And in case it hasn't been said yet, the truck itself is totally awesome.  Will definitely hit these guys up again soon.  That El Coqui is the sort of thing 16th-century explorers ran around trying to find.  Yum."}
{"text":"Would love to have tried it but waited for 25 minutes and no hot water... Also no Danishes just circle k donuts:("}
{"text":"I love latino-owned coffee shops. Frijolito's is one of the best coffee shops (trucks, I should say) that I've tried! They were at the Patchwork Festival in Downtown Santa Ana.  I picked the Mariachi Loco (horchata with a shot of espresso). I love that they have options with soy and almond milk (for my lactose intolerant peeps). I'm addicted and I know that I'll be following their schedule to try more of their delicious drinks!   Tip: You get a free hot chocolate with Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"Tried their horchata latte and it taste amazing.  Will definitely come back to try their other iced coffees"}
{"text":"Wow! Their Red velvet coffee , should be considered sinful !!! It's so good!!! Great staff and customer service. Can't wait to visit Frijolitos coffee again."}
{"text":"I love this place and the people running it. Just a good coffee break."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great to-go coffee. I love her freaking van too. The entire set-up is impressive. She offers a variety of specialty coffees and I got the Mexican mocha. Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"The Frijolitos mobile coffee van sets up shop in front of my work every Wednesday and I look forward to it like it's Christmas morning.  I wish they had a brick and mortar store so I could get my Frijolitos Mocha fix every day.  Mexican hot chocolate is also delicious and they have packaged pastries for breakfast. They also do parties.  Go drink coffee!"}
{"text":"great service and delicious coffee. I love getting the mariachi loco! try not getting the song stuck in your head when you are drinking it ;)"}
{"text":"While having dinner at the Food Truck Haven, I came across coffee truck Frijolito.  They said that they are a coffee truck with a Latin twist. There's not too many food trucks that serves coffee, so I decided to give them a try.  As I walked up to the cart, I noticed a sign that said: check into yelp to get a free gift. The gift was a free hot chocolate. Sure, why not? The young lady asked if I wanted a Mexican hot chocolate or an American hot chocolate. In fact, she suggested I could get it iced, since it was so hot that night.  I decided on a iced Mexican (hot) chocolate, and paid $0.50 to have it made with soy milk instead of whole milk. I should have made it hot, as the chocolate sank to the bottom of the drink, and was not melted. I couldn't really gripe about the price, though.  The two ladies were very friendly and they provided quick service. I even did a little hockey ribbing with the young lady, who was an LA Kings fan who noticed my Ducks logo on my phone.    Follow them on social media and give them a try.  Their truck schedule is posted on their website http://frijolitosmobilecoffee.com/"}
{"text":"What a great combination of coffee with a Mexican twist! The Mariachi Loco latte is amazing and will change your life! If you are reading this and haven't been to frijolitos you are missing out! Thanks again Priscella and everyone else for the great customer service and new coffee experience!"}
{"text":"I had a green tea latte at the OC fairgrounds today it was the best ever!! my daughter has a hot chocolate and she said it was the best she has ever had!!"}
