{"text":"My husband and I have always had fair experiences at this establishment,  however today we sat down and waited and waited and waited.... after 20 minutes we walked out. Not one of the three waitress even acknowledged we were even there. Not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and always a good time! Every meal i have gotten from there has been a treat. Great entertainment and its close to home."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of bars/restaurants in Lorain Ohio. Mutt & Jeff just gives you both. We had a lasagna blackened chicken Alfredo tonight. Both for a great price both tasted really good"}
{"text":"If you're looking for exceptionally good bar food and good drinks on a great price this is the place to go. I had Garlic Parmesan wings and it was cooked to perfection: crispy outside and juicy inside, the sauce was phenomenal! Had loaded tots, and burger. Just perfect. Service was great, food came hot and fresh. Great old place to have good food and drinks with your friends. Will visit more often !"}
{"text":"Love going there for lunch. Waitress knows what we want. Specials everyday. Love the salads best ranch dressing ever. Must try"}
{"text":"Can you still buy drugs from behind the bar there? Used to be a fun neighborhood bar, now they cater to the lowest of the low in Lorain. Scummy!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for bar food, this is probably the right spot.   I ordered the turkey Reuben which wasn't great.   Didn't taste like real turkey and the sauce was too sweet and the bread was odd.    Everyone that ordered burgers loved them.   The wings were also a big hit in our group.    They have a nice selection of salads.  Service was excellent and prices are reasonable.   Is it the cleanest place I have eaten, probably not, but it wasn't the worst."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots around. The food always comes out hot and delicious. I've never once had any issue with the quality or flavor of my meal. The staff is always fun and the \"specials\" menu truly has some special items on it. Everything from chicken paprikash to Cuban burgers. Toss in the always affordable pricing and you end with a belly and wallet that are still full."}
{"text":"I took my wife there for fish fry and was shocked beyond belief! After dining on a decect plate of fish(nothing special) i went into the bathroom. To my horror i saw three bloody syringes lying on the floor. I told my server and she treated it like it was an everyday thing. After 10 minutes they were still there and we were gone. We should get tested for hep c."}
{"text":"Best chicken paprikash ever. And their chicken paprikash soup is amazing too. Wings are great. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A Beatles tribute band played Mutt & Jeff's last night, so I rounded up my family, grabbed our passports, and trekked over to the West Side to check them out!  None of us had ever been to Mutt & Jeff's, so we left plenty early to get some dinner there before the show. Good thing, too because the place got PACKED real quick!  Our server, Rachel, was FANTASTIC!!!!  She was friendly and patient with my family, answering their bazillion questions about the menu items!  (Good grief, just ORDER something already! Lol!) Mom ordered the Chicken Paprikas soup, everyone ordered wings, a couple salads were requested, the Bro-in-law got a gyro flatbread pizza, and my husband and I split an order of buffalo chicken spring rolls and a Big Mutt Burger.   Mom's soup rocked!  Sooo flavorful and comforting!  The wings were meaty and cooked perfectly for me...nice and crispy outside but juicy inside. We tried the spicy garlic sauce, the F'n A sauce, and the garlic Parmesan sauce. While all were delicious, I wanted to DRINK that garlic parm sauce!!!!! Holy garlicky buttery yumminess! The shared buffalo spring rolls were good, but nothing spectacular. Bro in law seemed to enjoy his flatbread. The salad-eaters had no complaints, and the Big Mutt Burger was DELICIOUS!!!!  Rachel did her best to keep up with our drink orders. While there were a couple missteps in that department, I really can't fault her. I mean....that place was PACKED and she hustled all night!  (Plus, I probably drink too fast anyway!  I finally started ordering doubles and Rachel asked if I just wanted the bottle instead!  Lol!  (Not in a snarky way either....at least I hope not. Aw crap, was she being sarcastic?  Damn!  Well anyway I wasn't offended and I laughed so that's all that matters!)  I wavered between giving 4 or 5 stars to Mutt & Jeff's and ultimately settled on the 5. It's a bar, not the Ritz, so keep that in mind. It looks a little rough on the outside, but I found it clean and welcoming inside. The food was awesome, the prices were reasonable, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Based on all of that, they deserve 5 stars from me!  I'll dig out my passport again and give them another visit someday, and I'll definitely get a burger & some wings again! (PS: The band was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!)"}
