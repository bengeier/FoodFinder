{"text":"Omfg. I stumbled upon this place the other night while on a work trip and came back today because I had time to kill before my flight. I was at the bar less than an hour before realizing that everyone here (including me) is a repeat customer. What a gem! 40+ rotating beers on tap, friendly service, outstanding food (I didn't think anything could beat the pulled pork poutine until I tried the mac&cheese with lardons). My only regret is that I can't fold this place up and take it home. Do NOT miss it."}
{"text":"First, let me say that the beer is excellent.  Where things fell down was service.  Waited 45 minutes for our dinner.  We saw other tables wait 20 minutes for their bill.  When our food did arrive it was good, though by that time our mental state didn't allow us to properly enjoy it.  Great place if they had their act together."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, portion size listed on menu is very deceiving! I don't care who you are, you'll hate this place"}
{"text":"We made a special trek out here for Montreal's supposed best brew pup, only to be told: children not allowed. 

Maybe it's a cultural difference, since in my hometown (Philly) the slow, 5-6pm hours are when urban parents like me bring our well-managed kids with us to brewpubs to enjoy a pint and a meal with friends. It's pretty shocking to be told you aren't welcome in an establishment."}
{"text":"Incredible beer and food...terrific service...fantastic atmosphere.  You must eat/drink here!"}
{"text":"Chouette micro-brasserie sur Saint Denis. On y allé pour boire une bonne bière entre amis et on a fini par commander à manger, tellement ça sentait bon?! J'ai pris une petite poutine avec sauce à la bière et c'était juste délicieux?! Mais tout était savoureux, les frites au parmesan et ails, et les frites à la bière aussi?! Ils appellent ça, belgian fries, mais ils ont encore quelques leçons à apprendre pour réussir à faire de vraies frites belges?! 

L'ambiance est assez bonne, il y avait un match de hockey à la TV, ce qui rendait l'atmosphère un peu particulière, mais pas déplaisante. Le service est correct, mais pas toujours facile d'attirer le regard du serveur pour avoir l'addition?! Bref, un chouette endroit si on veut goûter une bière un peu particulière ou exportée?!"}
{"text":"Excellent craft beer selection. A wonderful variety of international exotics, essential domestics, and unique local brews.

The food was really good too. The mac and cheese was rich and flavourful. Every bite felt better than the last.

The poutine.... MMM!!! I ordered the classic poutine (forget the name but it incorporates beer into the recipe). I was impressed by the quality of the cheese curds. Beautiful appearance, and great flavour and chew. The gravy was also well balanced and didn't taste overpowering as some Toronto style poutines tend to be.

Service was solid. No complaints.

Overall a great way to experience a Montreal brewpub, and excellent poutine that lives up to the city's hype.  I highly recommend for both the overall quality as well as the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  Terrible.  Bad food and slow service.  Beer was good.  Just terrible bleak service"}

Un énorme choix de bières pression (et même de cidre !) 
Et surtout, les MEILLEURS NACHOS que nous n'avions jamais mangé !! Même les chips sont faites maison et aux couleurs mexicaines ! =)
Bref très bon bar pour passer une bonne soirée !

{"text":"Située au cur d'une effervescence bien montréalaise, cette micro-brasserie artisanale aux allures mi-lounge classique, mi-taverne à la déco pub, comblera tant les bièrophiles aguerris que les novices. Les amateurs de honte liquide ou bien d'eau dorée étiquetée « sans arrière-goût », seront par contre déçus. Le bar nous gâte avec sa grande sélection gustative de bières importées (en bouteille) et ses bières locales en fût, provenant de diverses micro-brasseries québécoises (Brasseurs et Frères, RJ, Trois Mousquetaires, Barberie, McAuslan, Hopfenstark, Cheval Blanc, Loup Rouge, etc.). Découvertes du terroir brassicole assurées.

Côté bock maison, la micro-brasserie propose évidemment ses propres cuvées (plus d'une dizaine variables hebdomadairement, et d'autres saisonnières), brassées sur place et offertes en fût. Parmi celles-ci, notons la délicieuse Calice aux reflets de cuivre, une IPA au bouquet floral, houblonnée à souhait et secouée d'une bonne amertume. La plus originale demeure sans contredit la Gummy Beer, cette blonde à la gomme balloune... De la blanche épicée (Pénitente) au Porter Impérial (RIP Ultime), il y en a pour tous les penchants.

Le menu, d'inspiration belge, est assez carnivore, faut-il le reconnaître, mais a été méticuleusement concocté pour s'harmoniser aux saveurs complexes d'une bonne bière. Hamburgers et compagnies, vous serez servis dans une ambiance musicalement diversifiée, aux rouges lueurs tamisées, tantôt  bien affalé sur un chic fauteuil (l'après-midi), tantôt entourés d'une tablée de fêtards (le soir). Idéale pour regarder le sport : trois écrans plats.

Prix : Conventionnels
Spécial : 4 à 7, le verre n'est que 3,75$"}
{"text":"Great design, easy accommodations, relaxed time, my top three descriptions. It's easy to feel right at home here. The variety will keep you enthused. Was amused they had beers back in my states translated in french, ie. Two brothers : deux freres. service is superb, nobody staring at their phones here while you are seeking to order. Friendly anglais/francaise ambience.

Everyone should try this place at least once. 

Thanks saint bock!"}
{"text":"Good Beer and bacon and cheese popcorn our bartender is great our bartender Vincent is fabulous so friendly and funny and very informative about the beer selection love this place to bad we have to fly home to Vancouver today wish we had discovered it a few days ago"}
{"text":"I come to bars that are named after beer types or play puns on booze for one thing only - beer. The more the merrier. 

As said by other reviewers, Saint Bock is easy to walk by because neither its entrance nor its street front are flashy in any way, shape or form. You'd be missing out.

Le Saint Bock satisfies me wonderfully, with their wide selection of microbrews enticing you through entertaining names and descriptions in languages that sound exotic to most non-snobs. 

Never having had any of their food, I wouldn't be able to comment. I had the chance to regret not having any. If you're at Saint Bock at 7-ish, stay there and eat: the decent eateries  around the area have line-ups stretching half a block until well past 8pm.

Cheers. Or shall I say Prost?"}
{"text":"Vraiment un bon choix de bière. Difficile de ne pas être satisfait par aucune bière au menu"}
{"text":"A great choice of excellent beers, many made right here. 
We ate a beer caramelized hamburger that was delicious. 

Free Wi Fi, 2 screens where we watched the Olympics. Good music, good service. A great address!"}
{"text":"Was here during the Mondiale and they had a randall evening.  Despite the place being packed to the gills, the service was very good. They are super heroes.  The beers were also great.  Didn't try the food.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always amazing and the bottle/tap list is always on point. One of the best craft beer bars in Montreal, and a must visit if you enjoy delicious pub grub and sought after craft beers."}
{"text":"Hears the food was good, but didn't go there for that. Amazing selection of beer! Something like 20 in house brews, 45 taps in total and about 800 different bottles, WoW! Was not disappointed at all by any of the half dozen pints I indulged in. My favorite was the coconut chocolate porter. Delightful! 

Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable on the beer. Must visit again!"}
{"text":"When every other place is full along St. Denis during a Habs game, there always seems to be just enough room in here. One of the less touristy places along the strip I think. Multiple ciders on tab and glutenberg if you're gluten free. Not a ton of GF food options, but the nachos are pretty safe and they are usually pretty nice about food questions even though it's not their specialty."}
{"text":"Large selection of beers. Had three that were from them (the milk stout, a rose IPA, and another IPA). Also had the poutine and the mac n'cheese. All three beers were good, the milk stout our favorite. The poutine was also delicious. The mac n'cheese was tasty but oily, though that's being persnickety. Service was ok, accurate but not overly friendly. Worth going if you like beer."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to discover local beer in Montreal. The ambiance is great and the poutine is on par."}
{"text":"Today, the stars were aligned... a mixture of a long walk and some rain led me to this gem in Montreal.  How's the food? I have no idea. It's all about beers and service here!  Search craft beer in Montreal and this place is bound to pop up on some top 5, top 10 list. The atmosphere is conversational loud with some tunes in the background...basically positive :).  A must visit on your tour of Montreal and your tour of craft beer. Great selection of beers, including this (pic on the check-in) Session IPA."}
{"text":"My BF and I went for an early dinner after his friend recommended this place. We were able to enjoy the nice outdoor patio since it was a sunny afternoon. We both got flights with (1, 3, 9, 12, 15, 18, 36, 38 .... see attached photos). 1 was easily our favorite!!! The fish and chips were mediocre, this place is better for beer than for food. The waitstaff was not the friendliest but it was a crowded afternoon so they were probably stressed. Huge beer selection!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The risotto was surprisingly good for a pub. Fantastic beer."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable staff. Phenomenal beer list and great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a reasonably priced beer meca!  Forget Biermarket. Le St Bock has everything that you haven't tried but should have. I didn't really eat here, I'll save that for a later review.  You need to come here if you like beer. Also it's Anglo friendly."}
{"text":"Mostly an expensive beer bar, with a massive selection to choose from.  The prices are high, but the location is convenient, the crowd is nice, and there is a large selection.  I thought that they accepted credit cards, but our waitress told us it was cash only, and you have to pay as you go.  This can make the entire drinking experience stressful instead of just relaxing and drinking up a larger tab.

The main reason I came here.. In search of framboise.  I was only able to find one bottle of chilled Peche, and I drank that and left.  However, for more of the beer-lover clientele, this place would be heaven."}
{"text":"Totally fine pub in Latin quarter fun area of Quebec, decent vibe and friendly atmosphere. Fairly good selection if Quebec beers, not amazing but satisfying place to spend a few hours. Asian food nearby!"}

{"text":"In here with my pal Marine Lacoste, the keyboard player from Uncle Kracker, and my Francophone Passepartout Beno, who used to squire me about when I came up here to do my \"chien et poney\" show for Hammond.

Nominally a beer showcase, the food is featured as well. I opted for a number of appetizers-as-tapas to go with the beer. I love Olives, and they were featured. They came warm, which was a surprise, with some seasonings and a few other veggie things. Delicious! I also swung with a Beef Tartare which is hard to find in the USA, due to culinary paranoia. Surprise! I survived. (and it was yummy). I also was advised to get the Poutine, which is a big deal up here. Fries with cheese curds and brown gravy. I'm neither a fan of Fries nor brown gravy, and My folks used to live withing a mile of a deep rural cheesemonger in Wisconsin who made excellent Curds. Sorry, Cher, I can live without Poutine.

I had three different Beers, all excellent. Don't remember their names....

The company/conversation was better than the food, but still not bad at all..."}
{"text":"At any given time they have more than fifty beer on tap(I'm not kidding) to choose from, a lot of which are their home brews. They also have a book with over 800 beer imports to choose from if none of the draughts are to your liking or if you're after something very specific.
Pretty decent cocktails menu if beer is not your thing. A lot of options for food as well which is much more than you would expect. 
The place is very crowded at most times, so please expect to wait for a few minutes to get a table and be patient knowing that the wait staff is trying to serve each of their patrons to the best of their ability. 
Go, visit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Cool selection of drinks and the shooters/shots menu has some great options, but terrible service. Asked for water twice before getting it, and once we got our drinks I didn't see our waitress for over half an hour.

Also, place is kind of dirty. There was a bug floating in my boyfriends drink and the wall area we were seated next to was really dusty. Yummy drinks but I won't be back. 

Ps. I'm writing this review while waiting for the check from our waitress but she hasn't even looked in our direction for more than 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"Cozy and with a long list of beers to choose from, Le Saint Bock is an awesome place to hang out with a close friend or a whole bunch of them. Service, when it's busy, leaves a little to be desired as it took awhile for someone to take our order, but the beer arrives quickly and they check up on you often enough.

I'm a big fan of stouts and brown ales and I highly recommend the Gargouille brown ale and the Odysée stout.

Cheers!"}

tons of great beers on draft.
incredibly lively crowd on the weekend.
great servers explains the menu
and suggested nice beers for us.
reasonably priced."}

{"text":"This was around the corner from where we were staying while visiting Montreal, and it was one of our favorite spots. It's a rather modern, but also a cozy and busy place to grab a beer and possibly watch some hockey. 

There's a wonderful selection which can be seen on the screens or online, and the servers are really knowledgeable if you want to match it with your food or try a specific type or brewery. As far as food, the mac and cheese is delicious (and pretty generous!),there's a great poutine selection, and I thought the fish and chips were pretty solid too. Nice staff and a busy area to explore afterwards."}

{"text":"LOVED the place!
Beer- what a selection! And for your convenience all the beers are listed on their website. We had the Pineapple Express and Pot Not Pot or something like that and the NW IPA. These are some great beers. 
Food- we started with the bacon nachos. Portions are humongous a d two of us were full after splitting the plate.
Service- awesome! Super nice, friendly and helpful
Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Excellent microbrewery with an awesome choice of beers.

They offer lots of homemade beers and more from others brewers.

They offer pub meals and i really like my fish n chips and burgers are good too.

Good place to let the pressure off !

Excellente micro-brasserie avec un choix époustouflant de bières artisanales.

Leurs bières brassée sont excellentes et il offre aussi des bières d'autre brasseurs.

Ils offrent des repas genre pub, mon fish and chip était très bon et le burger est bon.

Bon endroit pour décompresser !"}

{"text":"Great bar with decent prices. Love their pints and they have a great selection of beer."}
{"text":"I like Le Saint Bock; it holds a sentimental place for me, as we started a mini-pub crawl here for my friend's bachelor party.

It was a Saturday afternoon and we arrived shortly after the joint opened up at 1 PM.  We sat indoors in large, comfy, black vinyl chairs that faced a wall filled with a variety of colorful beer bottles.  This seating arrangement reminded me of a lounge and was very conducive to accommodate our party of 11 guys.

The bartender/waitress was efficient, friendly, and adorable.  She made sure our beer glasses were never empty and brought our fresh nachos and wings plates quickly.

The beer selection here is impressive (20 beers on tap) and the light atmosphere was an excellent starting point for a fun-filled day in Montreal.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful beers with a varied selection (19 on tap when I stopped in).  Nice patio seating if the weather's nice - and World Cup on the numerous tvs.  Didn't try the food - but what I saw being served looked pretty good.

Update:  stopped in again to catch the World Cup and have lunch.  The menu has a good selection of what you'd expect from a bar.  The burger I ordered was quite good and came with a side of fries and a salad.  Ran a tab and paid with a credit card with no problem - not sure why the other reviewer had trouble.  Also, all the beers are cheaper before 7 - and they serve pitchers of most beers."}
{"text":"Beer selection was good.  Server was attentive but very busy.  Food was ok - the point of the place is really beer."}
{"text":"Almost nonexistent service -- had to hunt down a server after waiting 15 mins at a table. My friends ordered beer and it took quite a while to arrive. The food was hit or miss -- the Mac and cheese was underwhelming, the fish and chips were standard (read: good), the poutine was better than most, but the true star was the corn dogs with a curry ketchup -- it is he ONLY reason for such a high star rating. Worth going back just for them!"}
{"text":"The Saint-Bock is great. I am not a big beer fan but even this places had me pulling taps. They have a beer bible which is actually a bound book if that can give you an idea of how many beers that they have. Though we did not eat all I hear about during our entire visit from other patrons was, of course, about the Poutine. Their Poutine selection is pretty incredible and if Poutine is your thing than this is your jam. The one thing to bear in mind is that they do a lot of groups of large beer tastings so if you don't want the loud chatter during one of these days you may want to enjoy time out on their patio. The service was great and for a non-beer drinker the beer selection and beer was terrific."}
{"text":"We went to this place at 9:40pm. The place was busy but not all tables were occupied. We asked for a table for two and was told that they had to re-arrange the tables. We were left standing for 10 minutes while the waiter continued serving other people. Finally got seated and got the menu. Waited until 10:10pm and we were basically ignored. Other tables with big groups got served first. We decided to leave the place and the same waiter who seated us saw us leaving didn't even bother asking us or addressing what the problem was. There are many other good restaurants on the same street. Avoid this if they are busy and if you don't have time to wait"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers (about 40 on the blackboard menu) and decent smoked meat poutine. However, the gravy was way too salty, which made it less enjoyable the more I ate. 

Great location on St.Denis, and seemed to be busy/popular, especially because they have a nice patio area with plenty of seating. Would be great in the evening too, when the music gets louder. Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has tons of beers on tap.  This is one of the places I wish I was able to explore the beer menu more.  I only managed to try 2 of their dark brews (Malediction and Sabbath).  Both good, but just nothing that would be on the top of my lists.  Appetizers here are delicious.  Had a warm brie with maple and pecans.  The bread it was served with was amazing, super soft and fresh.  I gotta learn how to make this."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that it is directly next to a strip club scare you away. They have the 4 largest collection of bottled beers so you will definitely find a beer that makes you happy, plus, they brew their own beers on site as well. 

The pouting is delicious. The cheese curd is unpasteurized and fresh (can't get that in the states). The gravy is beef broth and has beer mixed into it.... just don't add ketchup or they will give you weird looks, it's not accepted here.

The bathrooms are downstairs and you need to go down some narrow steps...if you are drinking, you might need an escort to help you down."}
{"text":"There is a huge variety of craft beer available here! I certainly have only tasted a tip of the ice berg. The waitstaff is friendly and the atmosphere is hip. The prices are a little higher than I'd like if I were going to stay for a considerable amount of time. A good place to try some new drinks with friends and find your new favorite!"}
{"text":"Que dire ? Un pub très spacieux, proposant une trentaine de bières artisanales en pression ? Awesome ? Super Awesome ? Mega Awesome !

Je n'ai testé que l'aspect boisson, mais avec leurs écrans faisant défiler la liste de bière impressionnante et très variée, bah voilà, je suis conquis, de plus j'y ai bu justement de très bonnes bières. Y'en a pour tous les goûts, des bières de tous les types ...

Le vendredi soir c'est le rush, très blindé comme endroit, mais c'est un pub new age, avec des écrans partout pour les diffusions de match, même le menu défile sur des écrans ... pas eu le temps de tester les serveuses (non pas comme tu peux le penser, sale esprit pervers) pour voir si elles pouvaient nous conseiller sur les bières à goûter ... maintenant, il me semble qu'ils ne proposent pas d'offre de dégustation, ce qui est bien dommage lorsque l'on propose autant de bières à la carte !"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection! The Kunta Kong was a dark saison that was so good. Malediction was pretty good and the fuzzy navel had a nice amount of alcohol. Be prepared to be crowded and loud. This appears to be a stop on a beer tour and they had several tables full of people learning and drinking. Did I mention it was loud? I could barely hear across my little table. I think you're going for the experience and the amazing beers on tap and not for a quiet dining experience if you stop in here. Menu was okay. We tried a small poutine with smoked meats and some sort of beer gravy. It was just okay. I get the feeling the food is an after thought so a lot of the items are just okay while the real stars are the beers. Our waitress was nice, and the prices were fine so we would return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was our meeting spot for this fantastic craft beer tour that we took on our first day in Montreal. We spent about an hour in here as a group, before moving on to our second stop.

Our tour group had a small section of tables clustered together, close to the bar. There we sat, getting schooled on proper tasting technique and sampling two of the bar's many draft beers.

The first beer was the Calice, which is an American style IPA. They say that, at least, but it's far less hoppy than the IPA's that I'm familiar with. Maybe they make that comparison because it was just about as bitter as the IPA's I get at home. 

At any rate, though it was bitter, it wasn't overpowering, so it was easy to drink. We had a couple of people on the tour who were not drinking, so there was plenty of beer to go around, should we need seconds (and we did need seconds!)

The second beer was the Encensoir, which was a smoked beer, and probably my favorite of the night. It was smoky, yes, but not overly smoky. It didn't taste like you were standing downwind of a raging BBQ, which was nice. It was smooth and dark, and paired well with the poutine sampler we were given.

The poutine itself was...not my favorite. This was our first time trying it, and had it been up to me, after this sample I wouldn't have tried poutine again anywhere else. The gravy on the fries was good (and that's why our guide had chosen the Encensoir to pair - the smokiness of the beer would pair well with the beefy gravy), but other than that, the dish was kind of meh. The cheese curds dominated the small dish, and that's probably what turned me off to it. Not that I don't like cheese curds, because I do. I just prefer them melted (or so I came to find out).

The wait staff was friendly and accommodating, given that three people on the tour had taken it upon themselves to order a full-on meal in the middle of the tour, and then moved tables a couple of times to boot.

They have something like 47 beers on tap, and our guide mentioned something else about a staggering number of bottled beers for sale, but it was a long time ago and I was a bit buzzed by then (he was free with the refills, lemmetellya!)

We wanted to go back to this restaurant to try their food and sample some of their other draft beers, but we ran out of time. I did enjoy the samples we had, though, and would definitely recommend it for those looking for a wide variety."}
{"text":"Très grand choix de bières, qui se renouvelle régulièrement
C'est le bar typique montréalais dans le quartier latin
Bonne ambiance, jeunes, étudiants, toujours beaucoup de monde!
Bonne musique aussi!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a bite.  My only complaint is that it is a little crowded.  My friends and I have been here many times and it never disappoints.  The food is always reasonable and made to perfection.  The beer selection is good and varied."}
{"text":"Again, another awesome bar that makes me love Quebec more, and hate France a bit more...  

Le Saint-Bock is a popular craft beer bar, the place was jam packed the Friday night we walked in.  Luckily a couple of bar stools opened just as the wife and I approached. Thirty-something different craft brews are on draft at any given time, if you can't find something you are truly a hipster beer snob.  The friendly bartender gave us a few pointers on all the stouts, belgians, and scotch ales, our favorites.  Most beers are reasonably priced between $5-9, and I'm talking about Canadian dollars, so that's 20% off for us Americans. Sweet!  We didn't order food, but the pub grub of burgers, nachos, and poutine all looked delicious. Despite the busy Friday crowd, the nice cordial barman gave us complimentary samples of the beers he thought we'd like too...that would NEVER happen in France.  A couple locals chatted us up too... good times...I love Montreal and Quebec!"}
{"text":"Nice pub. I had drinks and dinner with my boss and coworkers while traveling in Montreal. Great location.The bartender was friendly and when we had dinner,  I swear that it was the Best Steak Ever!"}
{"text":"Best. Piña. Colada. Ever. 

I don't drink beer so I have no comments about that.
The food is pretty good. 

I give this place only 3 stars because it's not big enough. If you do get a seat, it's very right and crowded."}
{"text":"One of the coolest breweries that I've ever been to!  The staff was really friendly and the beer list is massive.  They brew many of their own beers but they also carry some beers from different brewers.  Their beer list is called the \"Bible,\" which is kind of cool.  We didn't eat but the food did look really good.

I absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves beer!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big beer drinker- or as they say in Montreal, biere- but when I come to a place like this, I say \"when in Rome\" (or in this case, Montreal).

Anyway, overwhelmingly impressive selection of beers on tap and in bottles, many of which I've never heard of before.  Staff are very friendly, and the bar itself is cozy and cute, offering tables, barstools and couches as seating options.

Admittedly, my French is nowhere near good enough to understand what was on the menu, and I was too embarrassed to ask.  So we went with the one menu item we recognized- Pizza.  It wasn't great, but we were hungry and it went well with the beer.  

I had the Purgatoire IPA for the first, and then moved to the Double Nelson.  That one was so delicious that I mentioned to the server how much I liked it.  It turned out to be one of his favorites as well, as he smiled and responded, \"it's pretty interesting,eh?\"

Oh, Canada."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get food and beer; they have over 40 on draught! I had a Berliner Weiss aged in a Shiraz cask, super tasty. You can upgrade your fries to a beer poutine, what more do you need? Service is great too, very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Amazing and vast offerings of beers and ciders. Knowledgeable wait staff. We went early when they opened and the bartender expertly created flights for everyone in our group based on individual tastes and likes of beers we regularly drink. Most of the products were Quebecois, and several we're from craft breweries in Montreal. Make sure you have a flashlight app on your phone as it's dark in here even during the day. If you launch the restaurants website, there is an up to date listing of every beer they have on tap. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A really fun place for pints with the bonus of food. I wasn't super impressed with my veg poutine, but eh, the cider made up for it.

Service was great and the beer menu is pretty big.  My husband fell in love with Sweet Jesus. We now have a problem ;)"}
{"text":"Good beer, and good food. Hard to get a table, service mediocre, but not bad enough to boycott the place :) In the summer, sitting on the terrace is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a lunch time sports bar in Montrèal to watch the last Ottawa Senators game against Philadelphia. We found Le Saint Bock and this place rocked. 42 beers on tap and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"We came in for the beers - and yes they have a nice list of brews... But the staff doesn't know their blonds to their darks and well when you're in a brewpub that's really not a good point. The seating is really uncomfortable as they tried to put as many tables and seats in as little space possible so don't even think about stretching your legs without hitting a few people in the process. The music was really loud but I guess that's what they call \"young and urban atmosphere\" (I suppose I'm getting old!). We ended up eating and that was not a good idea... The food was just re-heated frozen anything, the fried were totally undercooked, the burgers tasteless and chewy, the sauce had been siting there too long and well the whole thing was just not good. Really if you're looking for nice beers, nice foods, nice staff and nice atmosphere... go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Très bon endroit j'ai très bien mangé et ai été très bien servi par (d'après ma facture) Julien C. Qui est Très aimable ... merci"}
{"text":"One thing I noticed about all of the establishments in montreal is that in general they are woefully understaffed. So let me open with the disclaimer that we came in when the place was first opening up and by the time we left the place had filled up and the service had slowed down.

That being said, the service overall was still very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient enough.

What everyone says about the beers are true - they have 20+ really unique interesting brews on tap, several of them their own bock brand. The server helped us pick out a few and all were excellent and fairly priced (especially considering the quality).

I found the food offered here to be simple, but really well done  - we ordered a baked Brie with sun dried tomato pesto that was to die for (doesn't sound simple but baked Brie seems to be a common menu item) and I had a really tasty chicken and goat cheese sandwich. Both the fries and the garden salad that accompanied it were also pretty good.

Overall we had a fantastic lunch here - great beer, food, and service."}
{"text":"5 stars for beer - amazing selection, knowledgeable staff, and an ever rotating list of over 40 beers on draft. A beer lovers heaven! Also they have a beer bible of their bottles to top it all off! I loved their collaborations as well as their house beers - they were top notch. I only gave them four stars tho because unless you're sitting at the bar the service was slow and or non-existent. Also their food was good, but not the best we had in Montreal. Expect upscale but more bar food than gourmet meal (even though they have more gourmet items). We went several times during our trip for drinks and were never disappointed."}
{"text":"After a hard days Leisure, nothing is better than a Brew.
We strived to visit Local Flavour Brasserie Artisanales.
Le Saint Bock is a place that one can spend all night.
Classy somewhat chic pub meant for the 25+ crowd. 3.5'd

Draft Menu at the Bar was miniscule with semi-poor Lighting.
It was chance we sat at the Lounge sections near the Bar.
NHL on the Monitors at the Bar keeps you updated on scores.

Waitress, while pleasant had unsure descriptions of certain Drafts.
Twenty odd Drafts were chalked, majority but not all St. Bock Brews.
However if I'm correct, all were Quebec local Microbrewery brands.

Decided on the St. Bock Crucifixion (Saison Amber Pale Ale 5.5%)
Flavourful easy-drinking Beer that matches the atmosphere in shade.
If not for the overly blasting Music, we would have stayed longer."}
{"text":"Great quality and breadth in beer selection - with both their own beers and guest taps. Great seating with either the cool indoor lounge or patio options. Servers good too, on both our visits.

The only negatives were the price - $50 for 2 tasting flights and a snack of poppers - and no hefeweizen in the summer. But I'll definitely go back, though I'd order a pint not a taster."}
{"text":"A wonderful beer selection! We did not eat, but the food looked good. The staff was courteous and helpful. Clientele was a mixture of young and old, and seemed to include both tourists and locals. A very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"So this was a ten minute walk from our hotel up rue Ste. Denis. This a sit yourself place with options for sitting inside or on the street deck. The ambience was cozy and welcoming. Service was friendly and prompt as well.

The beer selection was available on a couple flat-screens in the pub. The bar offers wi-fi as well, and if you can't easily view the flat-screens, you can go on their website and see what is available. I thought this was a great idea to avoid waste with making print of the beer selections, as I imagine it is always changing. 

My only complaint was the menu wouldn't download. When it did, I found that it was a little different from ones provided by staff. But these are technical issues, who needs a website to get your drink on?

My wife got the BBQ chicken wings. They were tiny, but delicious and delicate. I got le Nazegon (looking for it on the website menu, to no avail) which was a pork style burger. It was juicy and delicious. Some of the fries though hot, were a little undercooked. Overall though, it was worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, food was ok (pub food). Very disappointing service, waited forever for server, we were sitting at the bar and the place was empty. I would go back again just for beer."}
{"text":"This place has an amaaaazing selection of beer, especially their vast selection of unique and well-made house beers (coconut porter whaaaat). The food isn't bad either (try the pulled pork poutine made with beer gravy). 

But minus stars for the crappy service- we waited forever to be served by an unattentive and uninterested waitress, and one of our entrees was completely forgotten about to boot with zero apology or explanation. Maybe service would be better at an off-peak time, because the beer is definitely worth checking out..."}
{"text":"Première fois au St Block et l'expérience s'avère plutôt positive. 
Un choix massif de bières au menu, ne sachant pas quoi commander j'ai donc opter pour un nom évocateur \"l'école buissonnière\", une bière blanche maison assez sucrée avec de très fines bulles. 

Côté déco, j'étais assez surprise entre lounge et pub du coup sans réelle identité. Quel dommage que l'alambic ne soit pas plus mis en valeur, l'endroit perd de son charme.

Côté prix, comptez 6,5$ pour une pinte de bière maison, 7,5$ pour un cidre. Pour la nourriture nous avons partagé une basket de frites à la bière bien trop cuites.... 

Les serveurs sont très rapides et souriants ce qui est très appréciable dans ce genre d'établissement. La clientèle est très sympa également, pas mal d'étudiants (de l'UQAM à deux pas), quelques profs en goguette et il est facile de se retrouver entre tables voisines dans de grandes discussions."}
{"text":"Je vais à cette place quand j'ai envie d'une bonne bière importée (demander la bible, ils ne la donnent pas automatiquement), et vraiment, ça fait du bien de boire des bières qu'on connait et qu'on ne trouve pas ailleurs !!
Par contre, côté repas... les nachos ne sont pas top et le burgers encore moins. Mieux vaut manger ailleurs et venir boire sa bière ici !"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, a waiter gave me a beer menu book that was as heavy as  Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\". As I was flipping the pages, I could feel pressure going into my eyes because I could not recognize many beer names. Eventually, I ordered Kwak :) in a special glass, and then worked my way down the list. Their beer and liquor  selection is very extensive and good. If you are beer connoisseur then this place is just for you.

Their bar food is good too, I've tried chicken wings, and other snack with pleasurable  satisfaction. 

I scrolled down on people reviews and observe that many folks complained about the service, but it solely depends on how busy this place is. On weekends they have so many people that waiters could not serve everyone simultaneously. Y'all have to chill out with these complains. This place is large to fit many guests so it is understandable that service would take some time."}
{"text":"Wandering around Quartier Latin, this is the ONLY bar I was even interested in going inside of. What a great beer selection! We ordered dinner at 1AM and the food was great. My brie veggie sandwich came with salad and fries, and their Saint Bock Porter was awesome! 

This is literally how I felt when I walked through the Latin Quarter: 
Punk Bar
Strip Club
Douch bag Bar
Sports Bar

Thank GOD for St. Bock and it's down to earth crowd, friendly waitresses who didn't mind my butchered french, early 30s crowd that was having a good time but not sloppy, and late night kitchen, and excellent beer selection. St. Bock saved my night."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't given any review on this place yet. It's one of my favs micro-brewery! 

The food is good enough, but this is one of THE beer place to go to. You get plenty of choices of beers. 

Try their malédiction with a marshmallow (or two!), if you like dark beer ;)"}
{"text":"Beers: 6/5. Their beer bible has a lot of great choices. $1 shots on some occasions.

Service: 4/5. Good advices. Be patient on busy nights.

Food: 3.5/5. Pricey. Poutines are disappointing (we ordered the braised beef ones, they were too dry and came with a single slice of carrot). Burgers are great!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is as advertised. Good place to go for a few beers and some solid pub grub. Lower lighting with an overall nice and relaxing atmosphere. 

My bartender was awesome, I don't speak a lick of French and was curious about certain French words describing the beers.

I ordered the Nagano burger and subbed out fries for a poutine  (I'm in Montreal....of course I Will!) The burger was flavorful, slathered in bacon jelly and mayo! The one small issue I had was the poutine was a $3.50 upcharge and was very very small....left me wanting more!

Great spot, wouldn't definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this brew pub. We enjoy trying all of their beer. Sat outside on the patio yesterday-absolutely delightful. Also, had the nachos which may have been the best we ever had. Do not pass up this gem."}
{"text":"In a state of quasi-culture shock, we settled into a patio table and watch the crowds fly. Hookers and strippers at the gentlemen's club nearby, university protesters, and dog-tethered burnouts smoking copious pot on the streets. What better environment to order a few half-pints off the chalkboard and carouse through Quebec's better draft offerings? Our waitress was the perfect nighttime patio-sitting attendant, keen and correct, but never pushy. The beers were always right, came at the right temp in tulips, and had a fair price on them (for Canada). I could have done without all the smoking, but this is Canada and apparently smoking is still cool here. Great selection.

A later visit for a cider found us stuck indoors with some really slow service, despite the fact that the only action was outdoors. Had trouble getting service and were really hot inside."}
{"text":"Straightforward and to the point.  Craft beer, in a party atmosphere.  Worth a post dinner beer or a late Saturday afternoon kickoff."}
{"text":"The most outstanding craft beer selection in Montreal. Love the religious theme; the staff are extremely helpful in selecting a quality beer that suits your taste; and their 70s music playlist is the stuff of sing-along dreams. Do not miss this hotspot in the Latin Quarter!"}
{"text":"Love the layout, looks very inviting. Great menu system inside for the 44 beer choices! Nice edited food choices with a mix of gastropub and pub options. Had the tartare really enjoyed it and two saisons Parc and a Rhubarb one. Good if a tad slow service.  Great place if you like to try beer."}
{"text":"I can't believe I did not know about this place earlier! They have a great beer selection with some playful touches on their beers. We came here quite late at night on Friday and got seated immediate on the patio. The four of us got a large nachos to share (nothing special to the nachos in my opinion) as well as a pint of beer each. I tried the creamsicle which was a place ale and tasted surprisingly like creamsicle! a strong organic undertone and a creamy after taste. Prices for the beers are reasonable as well !"}
{"text":"Une des meilleurs micro-brasserie de Montréal . Plus d'une trentaine de bières en fut et une carte de bouffe bien fournie. Seul petit bémol: c'est un peu bruyant"}
{"text":"I've been back a a few times lately, and have decided to give them a boost. The service has improved, which is a big plus in my book. They've also featured some pretty cool specialty beers this fall. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken wings, home cut fries and a wide selection of beers. Our waitress was super nice, a kick-back and relax kind of establishment. The music playing was a variety of 90's hip-hop and R&B."}
{"text":"I was on a mission to find a local brewery with a solid stout and an enticing menu. Le Saint-Bock did not disappoint. Their milk stout Malédiction is delicious, so I was very happy there. Factor in the beet salad, which is everything a beet salad should be, and the brewer's nachos, and you have a pub that I would happily frequent if I was lucky enough to live in Montreal. 

There was one blemish on the experience: service. Although I tried to learn some French before my trip, I was too inexperienced to hold meaningful conversations, and I was grateful for the server who could bridge the language gap with her excellent English. Unfortunately, her shift must have ended. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes, signaling with my limited French, trying to get the attention of any of the 5 other staff--who were right in front of us. Finally, another patron next to me intervened. 

I don't have the impression this is typical of Le Saint-Bock, but consider yourself warned. I was feeling pretty insignificant by the time I left...but wasn't down for long. Walking along Saint Denis in the sunshine is too much fun to stay grumpy. (Having a Malédiction buzz helped, too!)"}
{"text":"Le Saint Bock, a brewpub in the northwest end of Montreal is one of the most comfy bars in the city. It gets very crowded at night, and even though tables are packed in pretty tight, we had to wait 15 minutes or so for a table. The beer list is huge with nearly 50 beers, most of which are brewed by them. These beers were excellent from a roasty marshmallow porter which was a bit sweet for me (though it did come with a marshmallow on the side which was cool) to an incredible Belgian trippel that was crisp and clove accented in a fantastic way. The menu is shown on tv screens throughout, just underneath the screens that show hockey whenever it is on. When the Canadiens are playing, they even ring a bell behind the bar for each goal which was fun. The food was pretty good as well. The poutine was made with very tasty fries and melty gooey cheese curd in a succulent thick gravy. The burger was one of the best I've had, surpassing Shake Shack and up there with Black Tap. The meat was incredibly tender and succulent and perfectly cooked. The flatbread mini pizza with pulled pork made with the beer was awesome as well. Service was good, though a little inattentive and had to be called over a few times."}
{"text":"It gets the 2nd star because this place is a beer hall and I didn't go for the brews.

I was starving.  The food was bland, took forever, and the waitress was absolutely hopeless.  She was hot, so she probably is one of those who assumes she doesn't have to put effort in.  She brought my drink refill I asked for when I got my meal... AFTER she brought the check.

I got a chicken sandwich which sounded great on the menu.

The menu probably would have tasted better.

Horrible."}
{"text":"Our friends who live in Montreal brought B and I for afternoon day-drinking, and we spent a seriously lovely couple of hours sipping beers and catching up. Their beer list is extensive and they have a lot of different sizes so you can have short pours to try things, or get bigger glasses of stuff you know you like. We liked it so much we came back the following day to escape the rain while we waited for the Distillerie to open. Really friendly service and a clean, comfy interior-- definitely a must-stop when you're in town."}
{"text":"Toujours un bon service. N'hésitez pas à demander aux serveurs pour un conseil sur les bières. La bouffe est bien, sans chichi, plats de microbrasserie abordables."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a few beers - their menu is extensive!  But they are big, loud and BUSY so expect to wait a bit for service.  We had to routinely look for a server and she looked pretty exhausted (not sure if people called in sick or what happened, but she looked like she was the only few working there).

It's close by to a strip club but hey, whenever is that a problem?!  Sit on the patio or the tables by the open windows and enjoy the views/fresh air.

They put the menu on a few blackboards around the room, but when we asked for a menu the server told us to look online.  

Good for a beer or two if you are in the area but I don't think I'd put this on my top lists of places to visit when back in the city."}
{"text":"Great place for micro brew.  Very busy. Good service.  Lots of smokers on patio but great for people watching and a burger."}
{"text":"Just as most of the reviews have mentioned, I also have mixed feelings for this place. Plus I'm not a big fan of beer so maybe this review is even irrelevant. Oh well. 

Me and my boyfriend stayed at the hotel that was two stores down (well over the strip club...) so we decided to stop here for a couple of drinks. The patio looked promising, but full so we opted for an inside seat. 

Sooo we found out it's not really a place for couples .. Or talking inside. It's quite loud, but hey it's a pub right? It's supposed to be loud. 

The service is a bit slow, even though our server was really nice. 

The drinks are definitely worth the price (~$6.50 for a Caesar, $7 for a pint) but it's hard to keep a conversation and the atmosphere inside the pub isn't too great. 

I think it would be a place to stop by again if the patio was open and we would just want a quick drink, but you're really not missing anything here."}
{"text":"Liked this place so much that we actually made this our \"regular\" and came back every day on our week long trip.  It gets busy so literally the only possible negative would be that it's sometimes hard to get a table outside.

The beer selection was fabulous and so was the poutine. The beer they brewed themselves was awesome and some of the best we tried in the city (we tried over 50 individual beers) and their selection of outside beers was incredible. 

We had all the poutines except the Calabria sausage one and each one was better than the next. The fried sausage appetizer got ordered accidentally because of the language barrier... but what a happy accident! Nothing I would have ever voluntarily ordered myself but it was delicious! The nacho dishes were pretty awesome too for bar food. I would definitely recommend the poutine with carrots and meat, that was my personal favorite- I believe that was the Duvel one, but literally any one you order will be outstanding. 

This was my favorite bar in the city- it's an Untappd user's Montreal dream."}
{"text":"Beer - 4 to 5 stars.  Good range and strong selections.

Atmosphere - loud and young.  We sat just between the indoor and outdoor sections.

Food - only had the nachos but they were the worst I've had outside a movie theater. A minimal drizzle of cheese and a few peppers - dry and tasteless.."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of selections for drinks! A wide variety of items on the menu, including most of the things you'd find at a bar in the US. The menu clearly posted the prices for alcoholic drinks - which was a welcome change. They got us seated quickly even on a busy day after the Formula 1 Grand Prix. Food came out quicker than I expected and was very tasty."}
{"text":"Poutine was pretty awesome here. Microbrew selection is a touch overwhelming in my opinion, but it leaves room for plenty of choice. Staff is friendly and will give you recommendations. They also have cocktails if beer ain't quite your thing. Solid."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp. Popped in after the hotel, poutine is good and 16 of their own beers + another 16 more and a nice flight of beers to choose from"}
{"text":"A very pleasant place to dine and drink on St. Denis.  

Their \"St. Denis\" pizza is a very very thin crust, almost flaky type.  With ham and cranberries of all things to top it off with. Cheese is very gooey but in a good way.

Thing is, the menu is FRENCH ONLY.  I mean you can kinda make out what youre reading, and the lovely waitress was nice to listen to as she explained the menu in her Quebecois accent.  So not all is lost.

Beer menu is pretty cool.  They have their own microbrews along with some other international brews.

Price is definitely high.  But kind of expected considering the location."}
{"text":"Definitely a recommended destination for beer lovers in Montreal.
For starters, they have an insane selection...when I was there 44 beers on tap with a little under half of them being their own brew.  In addition to their house brews, they have an excellent selection of Quebec microbrews, including the vaunted Trou du Diable as well as many you've never heard of.  There's also an insanely long bottle list with plenty of Belgians, although I didn't quite wade into it.

For my visit, I was incredibly lucky, and they happened to be having a sour beer \"festival\" during my visit.  I never did quite figure out why all the servers kept using air quotes for \"festival\", but I didn't mind.  They had a few excellent beers including a Brett IPA made in-house and a spontaneous sour from Mikkeller that blew my mind.  

Service was generally friendly and nice.  And there's a beautiful outdoor terasse (patio for Torontonians).  

Didn't get to try the food, but from looking around, it looked pretty standard pub fare.

Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Of the three stops on our Montreal Brewpub Experience tour, this spot in the Latin Quarter was my favorite.  They have draft offerings from local breweries and some unique selections, such as a smoky porter, for us to try.  They also served up fabulous brie in a maple sauce with candied walnuts.  Be sure to look up and check out the interesting lighting fixtures, and peruse the beer \"wall of fame\"."}
{"text":"Very extensive beer selection which was easier to browse on their website. The atmosphere was warm and exciting with friendly service too. A must-visit if looking for a myriad of draft beer options."}
{"text":"This place only gets stars for the wide selections of beer and the food which is pretty good. However every time I've been (hoping it would change) the service was terrible. They don't have enough staff especially if youre on the terrace. Last time we went (and final time), we were sat down by someone and no one came to see us after that for a good 10 minutes. The tables in front of us came in after and got served first. Then the waitress showed up saying the section of the terrace we were in was closed? And instead of saying sorry and looking for another place to sit us, she walked away. So that was the last chance we gave them. Sucks because it's in a great location and the food/beverages are awesome."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun. The beer selection was great and the server had accurate recommendations. The burger was a bust but the fries were good. We went the night of a big hockey game and they did shot specials every time the team scored. Made for a fun and boozy night."}
{"text":"When I chose Montreal for an extended visit, it was partly because of all the great brewery choices. I chose 10 to visit, with no repeats. Well, this one I had to visit again. The food is upscale pub food that is carefully made and very delicious, but I didn't visit a second and third time for the food, it was for the beer and atmosphere.  The beers on tap are amazing. Soooo many choices and all good ones. I had a great time talking to other patrons and all the staff are friendly. Check this brewery out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pints and poutine!! 

Impressive and extensive beer selection, prime location on St. Denis, tasty comfort food, and the loungy patio make this restaurant/bar a huge draw. The patio was packed any time of day the weather was nice. Inside was inviting, but who wants to be inside during summer in Canada? Children are allowed on the patio up until 8 pm, which is a good indication the party starts around then. 

Server was very kind and timely throughout the meal. The poutine with jalapeños and sausage was especially delicious and not as hot as it appeared. The mac and cheese was not a favorite for children with the meat and beer flavor, but adults will gladly enjoy. Glad to see some salad options on the menu to help balance the rest of the glutinous food. 

Ideal place to lounge with friends and drink pints for hours. Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It may not be the \"best\" in any specific categories, but it's definitely a safe choice. Very well located, and big enough that you will usually find a place on most night.

Their main feature is that they have over 40 beers on tap. Some beers come and go from the menu, and it happens sometimes that they run out of some of the beers on the menu. Prices are varied depending on the beers, but overall not expensive unless you want to try some of the special stuff, like the Russian Porter at 11,9% that's 10$ a glass.

Their regular food is okay, but the stuff in the \"Collection Trappiste\" are decadent."}
{"text":"Je me suis retrouvée au Saint-Bock pour l'anniversaire d'un pote. C'est sympa, bien que très bruyant, l'espace est restreint quand il y a du monde, donc ça se bouscule un peu et le service est passable. Large choix pour les bières, ils proposent également des cocktails sans alcool. Rapport qualité/ prix correct, c'est basic d'un bar/brasserie burger, frites, tapas etc... 
si vous avez le temps, dernière le bar, il y a un rébus (jeu de mot et d'image) très sympa, ça valait au moins le coup de se perdre un peu."}
{"text":"Artisanal beer hall with 44 beers on the menu. Some you could order in pint size, others not? I guess because some are do e larger batch vs smaller batch. Here at SB there is an interesting concept for ordering beer. They have an electronic menu board AKA- McDonald's or Tim Hortons that rolls through the different beers. Not really my favourite way as you have to read quickly through the list of ten beers then the page changes. Sure it comes back but I'd declare by conception it was a great idea by utility and functionality it's a bit cumbersome. Maybe I just need more time to peruse a menu. 

Pints selected were fresh and tasty. No complaints here. 

We had a table halfway out to the terrace (halfway inside) and my complaint here is that there are way too many tables jammed into a tight space. Just watching the server navigate through the tables made me think \"good lord he's going to dump his tray full of pints on some poor person\". It didn't happen but tables are squeezed in to the max here. 

Vibe of the place was a bit sterile. We had one pint each and moved on to our next place."}
{"text":"First time I traveled to Montreal and I just have to say, it's an amazing city. The folks are great and friendly. This bar is located on a prime street where there's great night life. They have one of the leathery collection of beer on tap. I went with a group for a pub crawl where hit up a few other nearby bars and sampled their popular beer selections. Would definitely come back again in the future."}
{"text":"Un choix incroyable de bières! En bouteilles ou en pression, il y en a pour tous les goûts. D'ici ou d'ailleurs, le serveur saura vous conseiller. 
Bonnes bières, bon service, bonne ambiance, quoi d'autre?..."}
{"text":"Nous avons étés au saint bock pour manger et boire un coup.
Pour les amateurs de bières, c'est l'endroit idéal, il y a une belle carte de bières que l'on ne trouve pas ailleurs.
Pas mal de cocktails également qui sont très bons.
Pour la carte des plats, tout est à base de bière pratiquement mais pour les gens qui n'aime pas la bière, ce n'est pas gênant. C'était très bon et copieux.
La poutine y est excellente (plusieurs sortes).
Les prix ne sont pas donnés mais ça reste raisonnable pour un bar.
Nous y retournerons sûrement."}
{"text":"20 different kinds of craft brewed beer on tap - need I say more? Le Saint Bock is a great choice for a night out with friends and one of the best options in le quartier latin. The ambience is dark and cozy, the music hip and the beer is plentiful. Food is your standard pub-fare so it is hard to go too wrong.

If you are solo or a duo, grab a spot at the bar if you can. One of my favourite rainy day activities is to sit here and sample several of the delicious brews on offer."}
{"text":"Located a few blocks from the Berri-Uquam metro, St. Bock is easily accessable. They have approximately 8 of their own beers on tap, which can be purchased by the pint, glass or taster ($6.50/5.50/1.75). The brown and the porter were our favorites and were good examples of each style. The Scotch ale tasted a bit off. We did not try the food. It is mostly typical pub grub. Nice mellow vibe overall. Definitely seems to attract an over 30 crowd."}
{"text":"Beer selection = great
Food = awesome
Service = wonderful. 
I will be back for more poutine, black and red IPAs, and an Oracle (a great beer with a nice finish and a good dessert after a filling meal)."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers, including home brews, other local breweries, and a few beers from Europe and the US. If you can't find something you like, you probably don't like beer."}
{"text":"Ok selection of beers
I went there for the beers. They had a lot of IPAs and some stouts but that was it. Many beers of just two styles. My beer was ok and the food was ok too.
The server was beer friendly and it's a chill restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Comfortable place with decent prices. They have some great beers on occasion, but their problem is that their menu includes too many beers, so as a result they have a few gems hidden amongst a lot of mediocre beers, and if you don't know in advance which are worth it (likely, since it serves a lot of lesser-known distilleries/beers), you'll likely go through a couple of not-worth-it beers searching for something decent. Patio is nice but way too small and always full."}
{"text":"What ? I never reviewed Le Saint Bock ?

Ok this is one of the best Beer Bar in Montreal. If not the best.

Ask for the Beer Bible, I won't spoil it : Be amazed.

Add them on Facebook, they have special events with different breweries all the time, new beers very frequently.

Their home brews are just great and every one I tried is a perfect discovery.

The food is good too, the poutine with braised beef and beer sauce is delicious.

Oh and you don't like beer ? My girlfriend fell in love with their Pina Colada

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Good selection of beers on offer. Do speak to the wait staffs regarding the selection as they are very knowledgable!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here and im disappointed I order calmar for a enters and I got it after the main meal. The service was okay"}
{"text":"Bonnes bières, bonne ambiance et bien situé. C'est bien qu'ils aient amélioré leur menu bouffe."}
{"text":"I love this place for beer, and this is where I first sipped on Dominus triple about 3 years ago. when I came by last week unfortunately they didn't have the \"book\" drink menu anymore, *whomp whomp* but did have one bottle of Dominus double in the fridge when I asked! whoohoo!!! thanks to the bartender for finding that for me, and for another bartender recommending some great beers to try the second time around. will be back. thanks for not hating on the English speakers of the country :)"}
{"text":"St. Bock just won four medals at the Mondial de la Bière here in Montreal (where I had the honour to be a judge). I went there after the awards event and found the place very inviting. 
We had a very friendly waitress - much to my surprise she did not understand much English. The problem was solved similarly to what you do in Chinese restaurants: You can order the beers by their number - en francais."}
{"text":"Really good brewpub with a decent menu.  Enjoyed the smoked meat poutine and sampled two of their many beers on tap.  All were very good."}
{"text":"Waiting time can be a little long on a Friday night.
Numerous choices of beer. Good price."}
{"text":"Le Saint-Bock was located across from our 2nd B&B! The bartenders were very friendly and spoke English too!! 
Dan and I sat at their bar and ordered a Caesar salad and homemade beer battered onion rings with house made honey mustard. They had over forty beers on tap and let us taste a few before making our decision. Number 1-16 were brewed there. I first ordered a passion sour beer and I think Dan got an IPA 
The Caesar salad was delicious! The dressing was homemade and it came with real bacon bits. The onion rings were the best we've ever had!! Made with beer brewed there (beer battered) and the house made honey mustard, WOW!! I could see why this restaurant and brewery became busier and busier!! 
I even had a Kombucha they had on tap (think it was mint citrus). It's the new rage here and Montreal is into the natural probiotics (Kombucha is fermented black and green tea). 
When we visit Montreal, QC again were definitely going to St. Bock again!!"}
{"text":"Je suis surprise de lire autant de bons commentaires pour ce bar dans le quartier latin. Je n'ai pas été impressionnée tant par la nourriture qui était fade et trop cuite que par le service. La salle était peu fréquentée et on a dû attendre un bon moment pour que quelqu'un vienne nous servir. J'ai dû me lever pour demander le menu. Personne n'est venu nous demander comment était notre repas. Bref, grande déception. Mais certaines fois un restaurant aussi habitué à une grande affluence peut perdre le cap lorsque c'est calme. Je ne leur donnerais une autre chance que pour profiter de la terrasse, l'intérieur est trop sombre à mon avis et fait vieille taverne."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype I heard about this place. Yes, the beer list was extensive and the beer/cider delicious, but that doesn't make up for the shortcomings.

Our server, who was lovely, had clearly been handed too large a section for a busy Saturday(the place was packed) because it took nearly 20mins for someone to bring us menus, and a further 15 to actually meet our server. Then once we ordered food, a 45+ minute wait for  it to arrive, so we had finished our drinks. Our second round never came, I'm assuming the server forgot. 

Food was fine, but for a wait that long it better be fantastic. My burger was so well done I probably could have played hockey with it, but the poutine on the side was good. My friend enjoyed her mac and cheese, but we  both agreed the wait was just too long and the food nothing special.

It's a shame, we were excited to go here."}
{"text":"While very busy during peak hours, I was very impressed by the in-house beers this place produced.  One of the better rauchbiers I've ever had.  Prices seemed to be competitive and pub fare was up to Canadian standards."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and outdoor seating. Great selection of beers but be prepared for no service. We waited with no one offering is menus. People around is were waiting to pay but no service still. Trust me were not impatient but this was bad."}
{"text":"First off anyone who knows me, knows I like a good pint of beer or 3, I even get specialty beers for my B-Day and Christmas.  Well the Saint Bock is going to have me working for a few years trying to get through their massive menu of specialty beers.  Alot of them are Belgium, but hell the Belgiums do great beer, my favorite of the night was a French beer called \"page 24\" If memory serves me right it came in a blond, amber and possibly a dark.... but I only had 2.  At 10.00 a bottle it's not cheap, but you get what you pay for.

As for the staff, awesome.  I felt like we had a wine sommelier, but for beer.  He made great suggestions based on what we liked in terms of day to day beers.  The food was pub food but very good and well priced.  The ambiance was great, and the music was not too loud.  It often bugs me when you go somewhere with a group of friends and we all have to shout in each others ears because the bar has the music cranked up.

all in all a big thumbs up..."}
{"text":"Brew pubs are starting to grow on me more and more.  I was never the biggest beer drinker but as I slowly check out more places like Le Saint Bock I start to change my mind.  

They have a very good selection of beers.  I went with a hibiscus beer which was ideal for a summer day.  It is a tad on the expensive side and you're not saving much if you opt for a glass instead of pint.  I also had a cider which was thoroughly enjoyable.

Foodwise you can expect your typical bar food (burgers, nachos, pizzas).  I opted for a classic bacon cheeseburger which was huge and the meat was very juicy.  The fries too were seasoned and crispy.  Prices for food are in line with what you get as the portion was quite reasonable.  

The service was a bit on the slow side.  It took time just to get our drinks which was a little frustrating however I did like it here.  They have a terrasse which is right on Saint Denis and a wonderful spot to people watch in summer time although it does fill up quickly.  Food and drink were also winners."}
{"text":"Wonderful Belgian restaurant. There's a huge beer selection. The scotch selection was nice too. I had the blue cheese burger and fries. Both were yummy. A lot of people on Yelp complained of the wait and service. This was not my experience. I had a great time. I was disappointed that they did not have mussels."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends as part of the Montreal craft beer tour back in August.  This place has a wide selection of craft beer and the westmalle double poutine was delicious.  Seriously one of the best craft beer bars in Montreal.  I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were searching out places with good beer, and found our way here one evening.  However, part of that was because Yelp lists it under \"Bars, Brasseries, Steakhouses\".  First, and foremost, it's not a steakhouse.  Unless you count hamburgers as steak, I didn't see any steak on the menu.  This isn't a negative take on Le Saint-Bock, but rather Yelp. 

We sat down at the bar, and had a number of beers from their long list.  A few of their own brews, as well as a few Belgians.  Having Duchesse de Bourgogne on tap is unusual for many bars. . . they had two different \"vintages\" of it (2016, and 2014).  I had both, though honestly I couldn't tell what the difference was, just that there was a difference.  Either way, everything they had on tap looked good (except for kombucha. . . that just doesn't sound like something I want).  

We had some nachos, and a bowl of French onion soup.  Both were good.  

The bar staff was friendly, and seemed to answer peoples questions about the beers happily.  They were happy to speak in English for us since our French is horrible/non-existent (we were happy about this, since it seemed that almost everyone there was speaking French).

Overall, a great experience with a very good beer selection."}
{"text":"This place is SOLID!!!  Great beer selection on tap and in bottles.  Food was far above standard pub grub.  If you are in Montreal, you need to check this place out, they love beer, they love food, and they super friendly."}
{"text":"Solid beer selection, I suppose. Wasn't impressed by their house IPA. Pretty good sausage poutine and ok risotto."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection - we ended up coming back here almost every day on our Montreal visit because there were over 40 great beers on draft. The staff was helpful in picking out beers, and they have a nice selection of local, regional, and international craft beers. They also make their own beers, which were quite good, diverse, and affordable.

The environment is upscale bar - pretty modern feel. Food was just ok - I had the poutine...it was far from the best food I had in Montreal but serviceable if you want some bar food or a snack. The service was pretty good when we sat at the bar, but one night we got a table and waited forever anytime we were looking for our waitress. Granted it was F1 weekend and they were busy, but alas the service was slow.

Definitely recommend stopping in here if you're looking for a good craft beer spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"Mon bar fétiche par excellence. Grand choix de bières, une ambiance festive et décontracté, et une belle localisation en plein coeur du quartier latin.
Une grosse préférence pour le St Graal pour manger, celui au brie bien sûr, qui est un plat très consistant mais excellent et accessible. Accompagné d'une bière blanche, rien de tel !
Parfois il n'y a pas mille choses à dire, juste que c'est \"l'endroit où aller pour découvrir les bières du Québec\" comme on m'a dit une fois devant le bar."}
{"text":"This place was great to hang out and watch a hockey game. It looked packed when we walked up, but it was just that everyone sat outside so the inside was nice and open. It's a nice, modern looking place and the beers are pretty good. The poutine with onions and ground beef was really good but more like American chili fries than poutine. The bathrooms though....for such a nice looking place, those are some scary nasty bathrooms. Also they are down a flight of stairs that looks like you'll get murdered. I took off a star literally just for the bathrooms traumatizing me."}
{"text":"Le Saint Bock, where have you been all my life?  This bar is fantastic!  It is a Belgian beer drinker's paradise.  They have quite an extensive bottled beer collection from around the world and 20 beers on tap.  The on-tap beers are a combination of their own brews and other local brews.  We tackled the 20 beer sampler and it was well worth it!  Most of the beers were Belgian style, but there were also some IPAs and Stouts.  Everything was delicious.  Also, they have quite an impressive collection of glassware.  (An additional note:  Not everything on their bottle list was in stock.)

The decor and atmosphere are very chic as well and the bar chairs are quite cozy.  As is the case with many bars in Montreal, the bar tenders are pretty hands off until you ask for their assistance, but they are genuinely helpful and friendly.  This is a bar that every beer drinker must visit if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Le Saint Bock has over 19 drafts on their white chalk board... what to drink?? 

I can't think properly when I am too excited, faced with too many choices: local Quebec beers from various microbreweries. 

I ended up just ordering by numbers... lucky number 17 and 19 at $4.13 each.

The low armchairs are quite comfy... and music quite loud... I can only see my friend's mouth moving but cannot hear a thing.....it is quite dark inside too and everyone looks good?! Maybe just a little too much to drink?

Waitress is super nice and ask if we need separate checks for our beers??"}
{"text":"We had dinner here because it was in the vicinity of our hotel and had decent yelp reviews. They didn't have a menu posted outside, so when we arrived we asked to see one before being seated. The person that greeted us came off as a bit rude, but we overlooked it and good thing we did. The food was fantastic as was the beer! I had a scotch ale which was delicious. For food we had the Brewers nachos, classic poutine, and onion rings. The nachos are huge and loaded with toppings. The onion rings were good, but not amazing. Poutine was so good and just what I was looking for. Our waiter was very nice and totally made up for our initial reception. All in all, a great place for a beer and some food."}
{"text":"Autant pour venir se réchauffer lors d'une après-midi fraîche de l'hiver que pour commencer une soirée avec des amis, le saint bock répond à l'appel !

J'y suis allé récemment pour l'anniversaire  de ma Coloc, et c était parfait un pichet d'une des délicieuses bières qu'ils offrent accompagné d'un plat de Nachos géant à partager. Une début de soirée idéale.

Le plus : une ambiance idéale pour écouter une game des canadiens !"}
{"text":"Wandered in here randomly on a Monday afternoon for a few drinks - had a huge selections of beer to choose from and excellent service! And on Mondays, we learned bottled beers are 25percent off!!"}
{"text":"This is not a place I would have chosen on my own. The pink lighting. The pounding music. It has a distinctly loungey vibe that doesn't go with the idea of a brewery at all. It seems like the place to find someone testing out Rules of the Game, not find fantastic beers.

But I was talked into it and I'm glad I was. The beer menu (40 beers on tap, plus plenty more in bottles) was on some horrible rotating screen, but it's also online. I did a flight because there were too many options to just pick one, followed by another round.

The blueberries with hot peppers sounded like a bold move that would either be wonderful or the worst (it was wonderful). The Duchess of Burgundy was by far my favorite, though.

I'm sure I'll be back to try some more."}
{"text":"If you like AMAZING beers, if you like to taste beers from different microbreweries, if you are an IPA (or dark IPA) lover than this is your Mecca (although I am not sure they drink alcohol in Mecca).

I love this place, during the summer you sit outside, on St. Denis where everything is happening and get to drink beer in a nice summer breeze while watching a festival or tapping into the vibe of the city. In winter you can sit inside, watch a sport event and wish summer is here. It doesnt matter the season, as long as you can drink their superb beer you know things will be great."}
{"text":"Excellentes dégustations des saisons. Petit coup de coeur pour la saison 225 rhubarbe et la saison sauternes"}
{"text":"Do you like beer? No, I mean, do you REALLY like beer? Doesn't matter. Either way, Saint Bock has you covered.

They have an ever-evolving beer list written on a chalkboard outside. We came here twice in a week and the list almost completely changed over. They brew a lot of their own stuff, and what we tried was really, really good. They had a great sour beer called the Abomination, which was gone the second time we showed up. Too bad.

They have a beer with vanilla flavors that they serve with a marshmallow. Plus, they also have a full bar so if you want a cocktail or mixed drink, you can have that too. But really, why?

They also have the famed Beer Bible, which is a list of a ton of imported and specialty beers. We had a few of those as well. Our waiter JC was a super cool guy who gave us wonderful recommendations (and also shots). My favorite was the Cantillon Gueuze Lambic.

Great place to sit curbside and people watch (read; watch girls walk by in very short shorts). It's also next door to a gentlemen's club, so that's always interesting."}
{"text":"Une bonne bière froide quand on a passé la journée à se promener en Bixi à presque 30 degrés au gros soleil, il n'y a rien de meilleur! Je suis allée au Saint-Bock quelques fois maintenant, mais ça n'est pas jusqu'à ce qu'une copine m'en parle que j'ai eu le goût d'y aller. Vu son emplacement en plein dans le quartier des spectacles, je m'attendais à un pub un peu générique, mais ça n'est pas ça du tout. D'après moi, c'est un \"gastropub\" par excellence. Ils ont de la bonne bouffe et un menu créatif. Frites et oignons frits à la bière, graal avec une salsa aux canneberges, burgers sur pains focaccia, nachos géants et super-géants, et bien plus encore. Il n'y a pas que le menu de nourriture qui est varié et long! La liste de bière inscrite au tableaux noirs change sur une base régulière et laisse place à certaines des meilleures bières du Québec et d'ailleurs, dont quelques-unes brassées sur place. En plus le service est super bien, l'ambiance oscille entre un lounge et un pub, puis la terrasse permet de passer un bon moment à regarder les passants. Il ne reste qu'une chose à dire: Alléluia au Saint-Bock!"}
{"text":"Wonderful beer selection, cool vibe and friendly/efficient service!   

Came here on a Thursday night after a Habs game to meet a dear friend and even though it was crowded, was able to snag a table.  The waiter was very quick and kept all his tables full of beer!

I like how you can view their beers online (or on your phone) as well as on the screens on the wall.  The screens have a lenghty cycle time so sometimes you have to wait to see about a particular beer but there's no waiting on your phone.

This is a great place to have some delicious craft beers and hang out."}
{"text":"Le Saint Bock  sits humbly on the street, unassuming amidst its surroundings.  It's beer selection is note worthy, the house taps are amazing. A solid Black IPA, a great Rye IPA. Drinkable, clean, and well formed. It's Witte is noteworthy, as it isn't drowned in Coriander like so many of its brethren.

Solid pub food, enjoyable when having an afternoon out.

Friendly prompt service adds to the ambience here.  It does seem to attract a louder crowd on nights and weekends, but that is much to be expected. During a Sunday Afternoon it tended to be about what one expects of a beer crowd. Also, a wall full of Trappiste, and other craft bottles adds a very nice flair to the establishment. I'll certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Great pub ! Delicious beer, fast service, fun time! Pretty sure we even saw saint Bock himself! Haha!(good people watching)! The French fries are delicious with the homemade mayo sauce! The macaroni and cheese is absolutely delicious! You only need to order the small size! The coder was very good!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately ended up here again, but luckily it was only for a drink but even that was not without some aggravation. Really rude and slow service. Music was incredibly loud. And why is that all the employees just like to stand around the cash register doing nothing while customers are made to wait forever, and ever and ever for one drink??

Le Sh*t Bock, you done did it again."}
{"text":"Toute une anecdote !

Endroit occupé avant et après les spectacles. Ambiance excellente malgré que l'endroit est rempli. Le serveur est courtois et rapide. J'ai commandé une entrée et un burger. C'est délicieux !

Ma conjointe commande aussi un burger. Petit problème: la viande de son hamburger arrive peu cuite au milieu. Le serveur fera tout pour réparer cette erreur assez singulière."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Montreal brewpubs, any really, ranging from hole in the wall to the bigger more established ones and I have to say this has to be one of my favourites in the hood. 

They have a big patio, which in the summer is perfect and inside isn't too bad too. They have a huge selection of beer, a number of beers they brew themselves and then they bring a few in too.

I had everything hoppy they had on tap and I loved every bit of it. Their beers are really good and the service is great.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I traveled from the US to Montreal looking for good beer and I found it!

Le Saint-Bock is in Montreal's Latin Quarter not far from Le Cheval Blanc, Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère A Boire, and one of the many Les 3 Brasseurs locations. If you're in the mood for live music, mainly blues and rock, there's also Bistro a Jojo; or there's a great scotch selection at Pub L'Ile Noire - both have a decent selection of beer as well.

At first glance LSB seem small, but once you pass the outdoor seating area and step inside you'll find that it's actually pretty deep. At night it has very much of a nightclub feel, and the younger crowd seems to thrive on that. Dance music plays and red light glows from beneath the bar, and against the walls. It has a red, black, silver against beechwood decor theme going on. It's slick, but not overly so. Given my druthers, however, I'd prefer to visit during the daytime when it's a little more casual and 'common'.

Look for a beer menu and you won't find one, unless you look up on the wall at one of the electronic menu boards they have. The draft list slowly pages through, offering 44 beers on tap including 20 of their own. The brewery, by the way, is tucked all the way in back.

I sampled several of the house beers and found them all to be quite good. The guest beers included a few Belgians, a few Americans (two from Stone, Avery's Beast, and something from Moylan's) which was highly unusual, and their Canadian choices were of the finest and most rare from Dieu Du Ciel, Hopfenstark, Microbrasserie du Lac Saint-Jean, Microbrasserie L'Hermite, Microbrasserie Charlevoix, Le Naufrageur, Trois Mousquetaires, Brasseurs Illimités, and Brasserie Franches-Montagnes to name a few. Impressive!

They offer food as well, which is mostly basic (although in Montreal where many places offer no food at all or just \"snacks\", this is something special), including soups, salads, sandwiches, nachos and chicken tenders, etc. The prices are slightly pricey given the neighboring competition, but with a few beers in you I doubt you'd consider trekking out to save a dollar or two.

Overall I was quite impressed by the beer selection, and I wish I'd gone here immediately (I stayed just up the block but I chose two other close locations to visit in the Quartier Latin and didn't get back until a week later the night before I left for home)."}
{"text":"I visited with a friend last month.  What an awesome place.  Fantastic selection of beers.  Great food.  Funny bartenders doing shots behind the bar.  I'd be here a lot if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Worth coming for the beers lots of choices. Some of them I didn't like the sour beers to me were just bad the mango was alright really liked one of there reds don't the number . The burger was not the greatest but I liked it . Stay away from the calmer it was one of the worst I ever had in my life it's kind of funny how bad it was but not because I still payed for it. Over all worth trying there different beers ."}
{"text":"While in Montreal, the family decided to stop by this pub for a drink.  Le Saint-Bock has both indoor and outdoor seating available.  We chose to enjoy their outdoor setting.  

Sweet Jesus was my choice of beer.  It is one of the beers made by Le Saint-Bock.  Tasted great!  One of the best micro brews that I have ever drank.

Pulled Pork Nachos that we all shared was not so good.  Meat was bland.  Chips were stale.  I do not recommend.

My brother n'law had a flight of beers.  He said they all tasted pretty good.  The ladies chose some mixed cocktails.  Neither was impressed.

To summarize, try their micro brews especially their Sweet Jesus!!  Stay away from their mixed cocktails and nachos."}
