{"text":"Consistently great food. Every time we go, the food is delicious. They are always busy but not usually too packed or too loud. Pub-like food. Burgers are really good."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this spot...I love the food, and the service is tip notch...Nikki is the best bartender on this planet! without her I wouldn't frequent this bar half as often!"}
{"text":"Best French dip I've ever had and the best beer also. Red Oak Amber was very smooth!  Overall looks like a good place but was pricey"}
{"text":"We discovered Sammy's from other happy Yelpers. As aficionados of craft beers local to wherever we travel, their $5 four-beer flight really fit the bill. Hubs ordered the French Dip, deliciously covered in melted cheese. My BBQ sandwich was just alright; I didn't like the sweet sauce. Another patron got the Fish and Chips Special, huge and yummy-looking. But the real prize here is the energetic bartender Nikki. She asks your name and remembers it. Such a pro, constantly multitasking with good humor. Belly up to the bar and let Nikki make your night!"}
{"text":"Nice American Pub \"atmosphere\", but not much else. We've been here a few times, and alway seem to leave saying, \"Well.... that wasn't SO bad...\" It's a nice place. We really WANT to like it... but we just don't. Servers are sometimes friendly, sometimes... not so much. Food is so-so, and a bit over-priced for pub fare. The last couple burgers we got there were dry like an old shoe. Stay away from tex-mex items on the menu (nachos, quesadillas, etc)... they just don't know how to do these here. Come for happy-hour half-priced apps and a draft beer - that's about their best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I went into Sammy's with a group of about thirty persons of all ages. The food was good, but what impressed me the most was that the wait staff was warm, friendly, cheerful, and generous with their time. They worked hard to accommodate the needs of the very young, the very old, and everyone in between. I imagine that groups with multiple checks can be the worst for a waiter or waitress, but they were awesome! You should go!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here SO many times I feel like it's time to write a review. I used to work near this restaurant and it is great for lunch and recently I've eaten here for dinner and it is also great.
The menu is great and has many options from salads and sandwiches to steak and seafood. 
I've had many things on the menu (burgers, buffalo sandwich, chicken tenders, pimento cheese sandwich) but my favorite is the BLT, love love love the crispy bacon! My other favorite are the fried zucchini for appetizers and the side of apple sticks.
They have drink specials during the week before 7 and they have a large selection of wine/beer/liquor and the prices are not bad.
This place gets busy so get there early to avoid waiting. 
Service has always been good for me no matter what time or day of the week I've been. The bar has many TV's with sports on so eating at the bar is not a bad idea either.
This place gets a bit loud when its full so if you're looking for a romantic dinner, go elsewhere. 
The parking kind of sucks cause there's a few restaurants nearby which get busy too and space is limited. I wish they would light up the street next to the restaurant to make it better for the customers. If they did that I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a great place this is. All wood interior, warm and friendly pub atmosphere. The fried fish was excellent and a large portion. The OMG Burger is duly named, piled high, quite the meal it was.  No complaints st all. We'll be back..."}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice size portions. Excellent wait staff. Plenty of TV's to watch as well. The only drawback is it can get pretty loud when it a full house. Worth it though."}
{"text":"Great food and staff! We had the fish and chips, had the order split for 2 and it was plenty for us. Our server was really attentive and our drinks were filled fast. It was very family friendly, no rowdy crowds or anything. The interior had a great \"pub\" feel to it. The prices were very reasonable. Go for it! You'll definitely love it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and good service. If you are in the Belmont area, a must stop. I had a burger which was great in this little hometown Irish pub."}
{"text":"Always a staple when we visit family and friends. A more than favorable alternative to any chain restaurant.  Great burgers and a robust selection of draft beer!"}
{"text":"This place on a scale of 1-10 is a 20!!! Great drinks, awesome food, and you have to try the pineapple knockout martini! The bartender Red is impeccable!  Management is very friendly and courteous. Chris made me feel like I was at home and a long time patron on my first visit. If you come to Belmont and don't visit this place you mossing b out on a good thing!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak was good, and I was impressed (as a Philadelphian) with the Amorosa rolls.  But speaking of geographically-based foods, I was disappointed with the so-called Carolina slaw - I think the owner must not know that Carolina slaw is a vinegar/sugar/celery seed-based slaw and not the traditional mayo-heavy based stuff he serves."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere. It's fine to take the whole family. I had the pimento cheese burger and the hubby had some monstrosity with bacon, chili, slaw, etc.-basically everything that should be on a burger if you're in NC. My daughter loved the fish and chips. She's such a picky eater but I think this is one of her new favorites. Our server was so nice. I don't remember her name, Helen maybe? But she was fantastic. This will definitely be a regular spot for us from now on."}
{"text":"Visiting the area for a wedding and this place was recommended by a local. Excellent choice.  Two of us had burgers one the club sandwich and I had a Ruben (one of the best I ever eaten). Everything was excellent the staff friendly and attentive. Definitely recommend Sammy's for your next casual dining experience."}
{"text":"It was packed last night so we sat at the bar! The grilled chicken farmhouse salad was great and my date loved his quseadillas. The drinks made by the bartender were awesome too! One of the best cosmos I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Sammy's today with my girlfriend and we had a very nice lunch. She had a salad that was a special of the day with greens,strawberries, strawberry vinaigrette dressing, Parmesan cheese and had the choice of fried grilled or blackened chicken or salmon. She chose the fried salmon and it was cook very well. The salad seemed like a little bit of a strange combination with the Parmesan cheese but it all worked together very well. I had a fried grouper BLT which was delicious. Thick slices of bacon, a good size piece of fried grouper that was cooked well and then a nice tartar sauce to bring everything together. We've been here several times and like it. My only complaint would be the tables are a little close together and it can be pretty loud if you're there at a peak time."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Friendly and comes off like your with family!!! Loyal people and great Beer selection local and commercial! Food is awesome and one of my personal favs is TACO TUESDAY!!!!! Great daily special and one of those rare atmospheres that make you feel like you have known them for years!!! Love them and great people including other customers!!! EVERYONE IS VERY FRIENDLY and I love their Black and Blue burger! Great menu selection of food, beer, liquor, and wine! Two thumbs and toes up!!!! EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"30 min wait and no one ever came. Told the girl that seats you we havent been waited on and was going to leave she asked what table we were at and said sorry, have a good evening. We left. Guessing this place has all the business it can handle or needs."}
{"text":"We went for the first time last night and the experience was ok, but far from stellar. The first impression was terrible. We were told a 15 minute wait but it was more like 30. The hostess was visibly stressed, running around like crazy... There is no \"waiting\" area so everyone waiting for a table crowds the doorway and stares at the diners waiting for them to finish. Very awkward and uncomfortable. 

We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and were disappointed. The salsa was great, but the nachos themselves had very little cheese and way too much lettuce. We would not order them again.

For my meal I got a blackened tilapia sandwich with a side of fried okra. The coleslaw was perfectly sweet and crunchy, the okra was great, and the fish was delicious as well. I didn't eat the bun because it was a plain, soggy Wonder bread type bun (on a $13 sandwich!). The fish was spicy and maybe slightly over seasoned, but it was good. My husband was very happy with his fish and chips. He got a ton of food and it was all good. 

Overall... Great beer selection, great friendly server, and decent food. Not sure we will be back. With tip, our meal was $60 for 2 adults, and I think we could have gotten better quality for cheaper somewhere else."}
{"text":"i love this placed . People here work hard to bring good food to customer. I dont know why the guy Scott G would give you two 3 stars?\"meh..its ok?\"  he always give out 2 or 3 to other restaurant he review so does that make him a really  pickiiiiiiii person? only god can come down to service you then he will be please? seriously scott g? tell other people if you wan better food go somewhere else? is yelp the only place you tell other people your opinion? because noone else in your real life would listen to your crap? if your friend and mom and family know that you been say these things online would they beat the crap out of you? seriously scott G.? dont be daft and use the internet for good.  Instead complaining and spreading hate on the internet. why don't you support the business instead? instead complaining about every little thing that doesnt suit you, why not be a better man and help business to grow and help hard working people keep their job instead complaining how its not good enough for you.  why dont you try to walk a mile in their shoe instead being judgmental. yelp was intended to give people a voice but i dont think it is intended for people to be more judgmental and created headache for business owner. Hello? is anybody out there? can you hear me? calling all the good yelper out  there? please help the good hard working people stAY in business with good review and tell peopple like scott g. to please change his thinking."}
{"text":"This is a great local place to hang out and get an OMB Copper. 5 buck pints.  The wings and burgers are tasty, ask for the Wings to be double fried. Seriously. The community table is fun or good for big groups. 
Come once then come again. 

Not a great gluten free selection. The pork is gluten free and they are willing to try."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice while visiting my in-laws.  Pretty good food and atmosphere.  Nothing special or exciting, but still a good meal."}
{"text":"Ok hamburgers. Forget the pulled pork. Service goes from bearable to lousy."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Went here tonight. Was told it was a 10-15 minute wait. After 35 minutes and the hostess not having a clue of who came in first. She sat people who just came in the door rather than the list we were on. This place is a joke. I and my 5 friends will never be back. Went to friends right down the street and it was awesome. Avoid this place at all cost, no organization or management. Big JOKE!!!"}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago and it was great. I got the black and blue burger and my husband got one with eggs on it (don't remember the name). Both were fantastic. Great home-grilled taste to the meat. 
We also got fried zucchini as an appetizer, which was good. 
If I lived here I would definitely come back often for the burgers."}
{"text":"What a neat little place in the heart of adorable small town main street USA.  Golly you could just feel the nerve signals pulsing down the spinal cord of America.
But for reals.  A more than adequate beer selection.  TVs playing whatever \"the game\" is, and our bottomless sweet teas were never less than half full.  Quick seating on a busy Saturday afternoon.  Of course, you say, those are things one should expect from any pub.  Well the reason this place gets better than an OK is because the food was really tasty!  I got the cowboy burger that had this amazing smoky bacon on it.  I'll bet the BLT is simply divine.  David X. got some chili - it was perfect with a bit of Tabasco sauce added - and a scrumptious little cup of mac and cheese that tasted like actual cheese.  Win."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Belmont, amazing beer selection, delicious food ( however they won't cook a burger medium temp), friendly staff especially the Bar tenders!!"}
{"text":"Been going downhill swiftly since the change in ownership. Today was most likely my last visit in my 10+ years of patronizing this place. Food just isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Service is struggling. It's not cheap either, lunch and a beer will easy run you $20. Today I went in to order takeout and have a beer while I waited. I watched 5 patrons order after me and get their food WAYYYYYYY before I did. My order was 5 wings and a regular Quesadilla, took almost 30 minutes. How does a fully prepared burger and fries arrive to my left 15 minutes earlier than my carryout order??? I was as close to walking out as I've ever been. Terrible service with no explanation why my simple order took 30 minutes of my life away. Sammy's used to be a great place for food and drink, now it struggles to be mediocre."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. All the food seemed to come right out of a microwave. My black and blue burger had this weird rubberyness to it. I then got food poisoning from it. Fun night. You've been warned."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pubs. Taco Tuesday is a must. Ryan is one of the best bartenders hands down. She knows her shit and will give you shit too. No place better in Belmont to get great food and a great beer. Top it off with some Irish whiskey."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted to try out some local places. The service was amazing, our waitress was very friendly and super quick. They have a great beer selection, something for everyone. But when it came time to eat it was kind of just average. We had deep fried pickles for an appetizer that were probably the best part of our meal. I had a french dip that was good, my two companions had a burger that was a little more on the drier side, and a chicken wrap that she said was \"ok\". We would come back for a quick bite to eat and a few beers, but not somewhere where we would go out of our way to dine at. If you are looking for an average meal and a good atmosphere to gather with friends then Sammy's will do."}
{"text":"I can describe my family's meal with one word: yuck. My wife ordered the \"Sunday chicken special\", which had the odd characteristic of appearing fried and crunchy, but in actuality it was soft and gooey (leaving me to deduce that it was microwaved). My burger was so charred and tasteless, that it resembled a hockey puck. The only benefit was that our waitress was very courteous."}
{"text":"Okay, guys.  This place has 2 things going for it.  First, an incredible beer selection.  Second, an owner who knows how to cook.  And, he makes sure the cooks get it right on a consistent basis.  Food portions are large.  In fact, we always take home enough for a late night snack (wink, wink).  They have a beer club.  Warning:  It's freaking addictive to try and drink your way onto their Wall of Foam.  Yes, you can have your name put on a plaque and immortalized forever by drinking 100 different beers.  Kind of sucks that Budweiser products are a part of the offering (insert gag reflex here).  But, so are weird ass IPA's so it makes the journey an adventure.  The food is incredible even for non drinkers.  BBQ, their salads, appetizers, and sandwiches are the highlights.  Burgers are just okay.  Try it!  Ask for Sara or Whitney.  They are cool waitresses/bartenders."}
{"text":"We are in Belmont for work and we decided to go to Sammy's since some on the team had been there before and liked it. Fish and chips were really good and my wife had a Greek salad with grilled chicken she said was very good last night... and this morning. Plenty of taps to choose."}
{"text":"Belmont is a tiny little town minutes away from Charlotte, we did a drive thru Main Street, seeing a little coffee and dessert place, we do a u-turn.There was a vacant parking space in front of Sammy's, somehow our dessert and coffee turns into a bloody mary!  YEAH!!!!!  It was mid afternoon, the servers and bartenders were all friendly.  She made us yummy bloody marys and told us appetizers were half off.  We didn't order any snacks, we had drinkin' to do.  Sammy's is worth a visit if you find yourself in Belmont."}
{"text":"Awesome French dip, great southwestern egg rolls,  the cheese burger was far better than the old owners. The new owners have made great improvements and are doing a great job. Best value in Belmont."}
{"text":"I have visited Sammy's many years ago and try to make it there simply due to a formula of mixing a great friendly staff, great warm atmosphere, a wide selection of micro brew, and a plus is food that is unique & plentiful quantity in a world of chain restaurants. My table had eight guests with shout outs on the wings, club sandwich, pimento-cheese burger, Tar Heel burger(chili and slaw), Rubin and meatloaf. Onion rings and fries are better than average. Even with a crowd the food came out hot and fast. Lots of big screens  to watch a game on a Saturday. Menu items and specials are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is my favorite burger spot to eat at when I'm driving through NC or visiting my family. I always want to eat here everytime I'm in town. Great atmosphere and great people. Eat here if you are in or around town."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my family. I have been here several times and the food and service have been ok. Not last night! I ordered the fish and chips and it was undercooked. Had to send it back, not really into sushi. I then ordered the pulled pork bbq. What a disaster. It was a big ball of mush plopped down on a kaiser roll.Had to drown it with their sauce to achieve any flavor. Yuk! The final straw was the sweet tea. It tasted old and not very sweet. Had to add sweet and low. Also, the glass of tea had very little ice. Now folks, if you can't get bbq and sweet tea right, you might be better off taking them off your menu. The service was friendly and the manager on duty offered to make it right, but with me, two strikes and I'm out--of there. Also, if you go on a cold evening, you may want to sit near the back of the restaurant. Every time a customer walks in , a huge rush of cold air comes in--not very comfortable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went just to have a snack with some friends.  We ordered the southwest eggrolls and they really were delicious!  I would order them again if I were to return."}
{"text":"Our real estate agent referred us here. Upon arriving from the outside it appeared to be a really cool place.  When walking in (on a Sunday) I immediately fell in love with this place.  I was embraced with such a warm feel. A place where locals can come have a beer, watch the football game on TV at the same time families getting together discussing local news over a nice meal. It's that kind of place. 

The decor and murals were an added touch to this divey pub. We were greeted with welcoming smiles. They have booths, bar tables, regular tables AND not one but two bars!  They have about five tvs playing with different selections of entertainment.  

My husband ordered the special for the day...Fried boneless chicken breast,  homemade red skinned mash potatoes with white gravy. Yummy!!!!!! He was very pleased. I sampled his potatoes. Very good!!!

I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was wonderful.  Not greasy at all. Homemade ranch always a plus! Iced tea very good as well!

Once I relocate to the area, I will indeed become a regular. It's great to get good quality food cooked and seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"Nice food and nice atmosphere although very noisy. Definitely a popular hangout spot. Come see what the locals in the area don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Sammy's last night for dinner, since it is very close to my house and I've had good experiences in the past.  Last night was no different!  It has the feel of an old style pub with bar stools and high tables all around, with a few TV's with some of the local games on.  It was quite busy (probably because of the half price appetizers they have each evening) and our service was stellar - my soda was never half empty the whole meal.  We ordered the fried green beans...both the beans and the sauce that come with them were wonderful.  I tried the Cobb Salad last night and it too was delish!  It's quite a lot of food for the price and the atmosphere has the small town, local feel to it that really adds to Belmont's main street."}
{"text":"I visit here often, I'm actually the duchess, but today I came in and they want to charge $.75 to taste a sample of a draft before I ordered. That's just ridiculous!!! Don't nickel & dime the customers or pretty soon they won't keep coming back. 

On other note, the food is always good & they have a wide variety of different items to try. Anyone should be able to find something on the menu to enjoy."}
{"text":"Man! I want to love Sammy's SO BADLY. Everyone that I know in Belmont absolutely adores Sammy's. But, no matter how much I WANT to like it, my many experiences here have always been mediocre (but I've never had bad service!)

Sammy's, for me, falls into the category of: \"The menu looks expansive and great, but it always just falls short in the execution.\" I've been to Sammy's probably 6 times now and I've tried something different every single time I've visited, hoping that my last choice was just a bad one. I've done the Chicken Club Supreme, the Buffalo Chicken, the Bacon Cheeseburger, Philly Cheesesteak (with Chicken), the French Dip & the BBQ sandwich. The food is never bad, it's just never really great either. The waitresses are always exceedingly friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. So, I certainly can't complain there. If you want a similar atmosphere with fabulous pub-style food, hit up Glenway instead!"}
{"text":"I'm from California but I'm working in downtown Charlotte for two weeks.  When the weekend arrived I rented a car and headed out to explore the area.  I came upon Belmont and Sammy's Deli...what a great find!  

I arrived about 12:30 on Saturday afternoon.  The place was crowded so I sat at the bar.  I was waited on by a whirlwind named Whitney.  She was serving drinks, taking orders, delivering food and even taking phone orders.  All the while being very attentive and sweet.   

I had the shredded pork plate with banked beans, coleslaw and hush puppies.  Be prepared to eat pork, I've never seen a bigger heap of shredded pork.  It was delicious as were the beans and coleslaw.  And the hush puppies...the best!  I'm not a hush puppy expert, but if i lived here I'd make eating hush puppies a hobby.

If I lived here I'd make Sammy's Deli a regular.  It's a cute place with a cool neighborly vibe.  Oh yeah, and the food is good too!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, so very friendly. Had chicken fajita which was a lot better than I expected!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great food.  Great place for a small town to have."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant with great service. Their burgers are the best. It can get a little noisy so if you don't want that you might want to go elsewhere but I tend to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another great time , they have the best onion soup.
Great service warm friendly waitresses. 
If you have not been hete your missing out"}
{"text":"I promise you, if you come in one time and get served by Nikki at the bar, she will remember your name, your drink, and your dinner order. She has that special bartender gift, that allows her to connect with her customers on a personal level. Sammy's is under new ownership, but they haven't skipped a beat. More craft beer taps, more daily specials, it's tough to beat. Come see Nikki, you will love the service with sass!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I got the tarheel burger and it was perfect. Messiest item on the menu but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Good place iv always had great food here. its Loud and packed most of the time but its kid friendly."}
{"text":"Very good place for a burger and a beer. The space is comfortable; the staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Ok heres the low down on Sammies.  The philly cheese steak is crazy good. I personally eat mine with ranch dressing. (Im from the south, deal with it!) I killed it without realizing how fast I ate it.  

The wings.  OH MM GEE THE WINGS!!   The traditional is buffalo with a bit of honey in the sauce.  Very nice.  A different buff than normal too. Not your regular buffalo sauce, so in this nut jobs opinion, a great rendition of buff sauce.  But thats not the sauce you should be thinking about.  

The hot sauce is unbelievably, insanely, awesomely, extravagantly, most superbly ORIGINAL!!     Try it!  Its awesome.  A bit hot in the end, but nothing a pansy cant handle. It has so much flavor, I literally made the guy next to me try it on his chili. 

Service....   Sunday night not terribly busy, but get this, the bartender, bless her heart, heard me scream for a hot fudge sundae, with molten cake.  I was joking.  She put the order in before I realized it.  So what did I do? I apologized and told her I was kidding and tipped her an extra few bucks on top of twenty percent. (Bc 20% is what you tip then add/subtract from there for those of you who dont know)


So in this poor schlubs opinion.   Sammies is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Madison our waitress was great! Prompt, friendly, our drinks were always full, and food came out  fast and fantastic. All around a great experience! Loved everything about it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I always love coming to Sammy's.  great servers and good is wonderful too.  Good variety of drinks and pretty much can't go wrong.  .....not to mention I'm \"Sammy\" myself."}
{"text":"I remember now why we never eat here anymore.  Burger and fish were both way over done.  The burger had so much char on it was hard to chew.  Pasta salad was mushy and starchy.   Music, beer selection, and service were good but not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  It was our first stop after touching down at CLT, when we would visit the area. Last night, the service was extremely slow, despite the place not being full.  Two in our party ordered the burger with egg.....terrible.  The burgers were overcooked and the eggs weren't sunny side up, and were completely cooked through on the yolk.  The whole point of an egg on a burger, is to have that silky, velvety yolk, running down and through.  The manager offered another, AFTER the first had been eaten.  We were told to ask for the egg to be under cooked next time.  There won't be a next time.  Sammy's has gone downhill of late, time to try something/someplace new."}
{"text":"I have spent a lot of hours in Sammys and will be as honest as possible. 

Never once had any issues with the staff or service. Food can come out slow at times but it is normally packed when that happens. 

I have been in here for more lunches and late nights but dinners as well. The bartenders all know their stuff and most of them have been here awhile. They remember faces and names and make you feel at home. 

The food is good to great. I love how they change specials daily and you can always get something new. Sucks to though because if one of those is excellent you may not get it again for awhile. 

The beer selection is the best in belmont. Just ask for the beer menu and see. The beers on tap rotate regularly and the selection is a very nice mix. 

Chicken fajita wrap - great
Lasagna - good 
Burgers - good to great
Baked beans - great 
Specials good to excellent"}
{"text":"OK here's an update.  Still Love Sammies.  It's very consistent.  Even though it's frozen meat I LOVE the Steak and Egg Burger with a side of Beans.  Still VERY Loud so we get a lot of To Go Orders."}
{"text":"The service by Nikki was the best I have seen. I travel on a weekly basis.  If you ever are around Gastonia you must visit this place and have a craft beer.  I come in here one every few weeks and the bartender, Nikki remembers everyone's name.  Great craft beer and superb service.   New top 5 in the country to visit."}
{"text":"Now that i live out in this direction, Sammy's is my standby restaurant when i need a good place i know i'll enjoy.  Especially Monday-Friday from 4-7 for half-price appetizers. We've tried the hot buffalo wings, the fried zucchini, nachos, the jalopeno thingies, quesadillas  ...just about every appetizer and i don't recall being disappointed.
(chicken quesadillas, sampler and huge wing orders are excluded from discount and one per customer, no take homes.. fyi)

As far as drink prices, i have yet to find a really cheap night, but they usually have reasonably priced beer specials ($3 New Castle or Yuengling). Nothing like college specials, but not bad. 

Things of note: meals come with a huge amount of french fries. The chili is pretty good (may be too thick for some). Always have friendly service. Music playing isn't too loud, but loud enough to enjoy (they need to teach a lot of places how they manage to pull this off). 

i haven't found an absolute favorite entree yet, but maybe you didn't hear me, i said from 4-7 they have half price appetizers Monday thru Friday!"}
{"text":"Always love the food,  but extremely loud when trying to have any conversations with the person sitting at the same table as you."}
{"text":"I have been several times and found it to be a good place to meet family and friends and it is half way between where we live and where they live. However, had to recently start eating gluten-free. When I went in there and asked the waitress if she had any suggestions on something good to eat that was gluten-free there, she told me there wasn't anything at all. Everything had gluten or wheat in it when it came from the manufacturer or else they added it. So, there was nothing there I could eat, according to her. I eat out frequently and have never faced that sort of comment or attitude. Went up the street to another restaurant and had a perfectly wonderful meal. Yes, it was gluten-free. Too bad Sammy's only caters to those who like fried greasy food with lots of wheat gluten."}
{"text":"Have been to Sammy's what feels like a million times since I was younger and have always loved the food and service. Sammy's has always been full of friendly faces and really tasty food. Could not rate somewhere higher!"}
{"text":"This is the place I wanted to be our new regular spot but the food is too overpriced for what you get in both quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection, staff is always friendly and about a half a dozen TV's for watching sports. If you're in Belmont it should be on your must visit list."}
{"text":"\"Meh - it's OK\" pretty much sums this place up. The food is fine (not great). The service is good. Like other reviewers have pointed out, this place is awfully loud and not at all relaxing. The beer selection is top notch for the area, and I was happy to see Oskar Blues Deviant Dales double IPA on tap :)

If you want food, there's much better choices in Belmont. If you want a good selection of beer, then this place is hard to top (at least locally)."}
{"text":"Good option near the National Whitewater Center. 

Was visiting NWC with family and needed to grab a bite to eat - as usual, Rivers Edge was packed so we decided to explore the area. Sammy's is about 15 minutes from the Center, via some back roads. It's right in the center of Belmont, on their cute Main St.

Overall vibe is Irish pub - gleaming dark wood, green, etc. Good family oriented place with a lively bar scene, lots of tv's. Service was good, friendly and quick.

Food was good - nothing extra-ordinary but the burgers look like they are hand-made, the chicken is fresh grilled and the portions are generous. This isn't very imaginative food, but filling. Special shout-out for the tasty chili and fried ocra, however.

In addition, the beer selection is great - lots of local microbrew options on tap and numerous other ones available by the bottle. 

Overall thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Being local to Belmont, I really WANT to like this place.  Given it several tries over the years and it is just OK.  Food is okay.  Service is good.  Atmosphere is loud.  They do have a great bar and beer selection but unless you are going just to drink I'd skip it, there are better places to eat in town."}
{"text":"Every time I go here everything from the food to service is so good! The cowboy burger is my favorite so far and heir chili is the bomb! Quite a few craft beers to choose from and a good amount of cocktails if beer isn't your thing. I don't know the bartender's name, but she's the sweetest thing and will concoct any drink you want! Love this place"}
{"text":"I just came in for a quick bite do I'm not sure I can do them justice.  But, I was greeted and sat at the bar instantly.  Where Nikki, the bar tender greater me instantly.  She is full of energy, friendly, efficient, and calls you by your first name.  I got the special.  Soft taco with your choice of meat and black beans.  Both were great and plenty filling for me.  Dinner for under $5"}
{"text":"The one thing I forgot to mention in my last review of Sammy's is that it is loud.  If you're looking for a place to wax poetic or hold an in depth conversation, I wouldn't recommend it.  The extremely high ceilings carry the sound exponentially and the place is usually pretty busy.  It's a noisy joint so don't go there for date night or important meetings."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and decent food.  This is a go to when I don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Sammy's is located in Belmont's adorable small-town downtown district. (As a result, parking can be a pain sometimes, but stick with it and you're bound to find a street spot.) If you're from Gaston County, you're bound to see someone you know while you're having lunch at Sammy's. While you're there, check out the cute boutiques and bakeries nearby. 

I've mostly been to Sammy's for lunch or a beer after work. Sammy's has good cheeseburgers, chili and other pub food. The servers are very friendly. At night, you'll find friends hanging out grabbing a few beers."}
{"text":"Great Belmont spot for a beer and a sandwich. Friendly, hometown joint with consistently good food and service. Random, but they have the best ranch dressing ever which I think they make in-house - they get an extra star for that. I always get the chipotle chicken sandwich with fries and of course a side of ranch. Decent burger as well (also heard the fish and chips are good) and great beer section that rotates pretty regularly I believe. It's not going to blow you away, but that's fine - if you're in town and looking for a casual bite to eat, definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"The service was super friendly but the prices are quite inflated.  Anything that has Deli or Neighborhood Pub should probably have some \"neighborhood\" pricing to it. The food is overpriced for what it is, even for this area. Luckily the beer was reasonably priced, and our server was really nice and attentive despite having a full section. Maybe having some more \"Pub\" food/pricing would be better for us."}
{"text":"The food is really great at Sammys.   And would rather 'shop local' vs chains.   My son loves their homemade chicken salad (orders it by the pound)."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed....food has always been great and we've ordered a variety.  Husband said he hasn't tasted a better burger yet. Wish there was better parking though."}
{"text":"We were driving through town and stopped in after reading a Yelp review. The craft beer selection is great and the one I tried was excellent. At the urging of our delightful waitress, we tried the fried green beans which were amazing. The gumbo was also excellent. I was not impressed with the shrimp poor boy however. Good shrimp but soggy bread. All in all a good meal and pleasant sports bar ambience."}
{"text":"This was a delightful stop for us. Food was delicious, plentiful and reasonably priced. I was particularly impressed with the hamburgers on the kids menu. Our server was extremely attentive. (Given that we were the only party eating outside, it would have been easy to forget us, but she checked in extremely regularly.) I didn't get a chance to sample the beer menu, but it looked like an extensive selection. The kids were unimpressed with their fries, but my chips were delightful."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you would expect in a pub. Cold, cheap beer- multiple flavors and drafts and crappy food. 

It isn't a Mexican joint- so don't get nachos or tacos
It isn't Italian so don't get the lasagna
It isn't seafood- so stay away from the fish. 
The burgers are good, especially the one with a fried egg. 

Service was marginal. Prices were fair. 

Fried pickles were good..."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a pub and doesn't try to be anything else. It gets damn near everything right. The food is pretty good, the beer selection is vast, there is a wall of televisions tuned to sport. 

My only complaint is that the service is slow, but always comes with a smile. 

Try a burger or the pulled pork."}
{"text":"We went to Sammy's last night at 8 for dinner and drinks. The food was excellent! The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and super friendly. She also provided fantastic service, and we never had to wait for anything or wonder where she was. The real superstar of the place was the hostess, Meredith. WOW. She was running the show! Taking names, cleaning tables, seating, remembering who people were to find them at the bar when it was their turn.. she was doing the job of four people! I was so impressed I actually asked for her name just to give her props. Well done, Meredith, and everyone else at Sammy's!"}
{"text":"Tough not to enjoy eating here. We love Sammy's! We split the BBQ salad and Alec enjoyed the grilled chicken club. Awesome service from Jennifer!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent patron of Sammys. Comfortable atmosphere, vast beer selection, and good food. Sammys has never disappointed. Over the weekend I had the privilege of being served by a waitress named Brooke. Let me just say, she is the real gem of Sammys. Very knowledgable on the craft beer selection. (picked out a beer for me based on my palate preference) I had the omb copper and her choice was spot on. She anticipated and brought things without even being asked. She was jovial, polite, and attentive. My husband and I were very impressed by this young lady's service. By far the Best experience at Sammys I've had yet. I will definitely be asking for her our next visit."}
{"text":"Good food and beer but I tend to judge when a restaurant won't split sauces on wings. They wouldn't even do it on 10 wings. They will split the wings if you buy two 5 plates of wings which of course is more expensive. Just seems lazy to me... take the extra minute and split the sauces if you really care about your guests."}
{"text":"I had lunch here while in the area for work. I liked the inside, great setup for a sports bar/pub.

I didn't have a beer as it was lunch but they had a TON OF BEER selections. I definitely will be back in there to sip on a brew. 

The chopped pork sandwich was good and I got the steamed veggies.

I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Good service. Good wings.  Good flight (sampler). Cold beer. Nice, relaxed atmosphere. Salsa could have been better than just out of the jar. We will be back."}
{"text":"Had the ribeye steak smothered in onions and mushrooms.  Cooked perfectly...outstanding flavor and huge!  Also had the fish and chips - unbelievable flavor, great size and wonderful tarter sauce! Sweet tea is fantastic.  Cannot wait to come back.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"A wonderful watering hole in the adorable town of Belmont, Sammy's is everything you should come to expect from a great neighborhood pub. The tap list is extensive and diverse, and the $5 five-glass flight is easily the best beer value I've come across in the Charlotte area. My Pub Burger was delicious, and the Nachos some of the tastiest I've had.

There are TVs on every wall, the service is prompt and attentive, and and the whole place feels like a warm blanket on a cold rainy day. Our kids loved it, and so did we -- a great stop if you ever find yourself on the other side of the river."}
{"text":"An average place to have a beer and sandwich.. Pricing for food was fair, but beer prices were a bit steep. We had a large group and service was great. I had the French Dip with fries. It had quite a bit of fat and the fries had been ready well before being served. If you're in the area I wouldn't avoid Sammy's, but I certainly would not go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"I think this is a nice lil venue for bar food!  The waitress was more than friendly which made up for their lack of veggie friendly dishes.  Oh well, ate some shrimp... Bad Vegan bad!  The shrimp was mediocre, coming from the south I didn't expect it to compare to the Gulf Shrimp.  Price was fair and what is expected.  The poboy I got was loaded with shrimp so there won't be an empty tummy on Sammy's watch!  WHoot whoot! check it out belmont!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Belmont and on our first night in town we decided to try Sammy's.  The service was amazing and the food was incredible.  We've been back now many times and every visit has been great.  There is nothing better than zipping in for a cold beer and a burger or sandwich.  I personally love the tuna melt with grilled onions - I order it with fries and coleslaw?.  Absolutely fantastic!!  Everything we've tried so far has been great and the service is super fast and professional.  A relaxing place with great food?  always on my go-to list.  Thanks Sammy's."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Was not impressed by the food. Had the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger. It was just okay. But the service and atmosphere wss outstanding."}
{"text":"Have dined here several times and every time has been amazing. The atmosphere is great and the drinks are amazing. Love the flight of beers. Never let down by the fish and chips - and they have malt vinegar! Best spot in Belmont!"}
{"text":"Love Sammy's BBQ Nacho's. Great place with friendly service. Also the Philly Cheesesteak is very good.  I do order extra BBQ sauce and sour cream for Nachos and me and my husband share them with some always left over."}
{"text":"Sammy's has a nice little atmosphere for dining and/or drinking. I would say things are more on the pricey side, but it's still a nice little joint to hang out with college aged kids and a somewhat older crowd. 

They do have a lot of different beers, on tap & bottle, from the lower range of miller/bud light to some higher end pricey booze. It really is a nice little place to go hang out with a couple of friends to socialize & drink some good brews. The food is pretty good, & they have everything from pasta dishes to fish & chips. A live band/guitarist performs every so often (Sat nigh I believe) and the atmosphere really picks up during late night on the weekends. But don't expect much of a crowd after 9 on weeknights, because it'll just be you, your friends, & the couple of regulars around the bar."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Personal favorite are he Reubens. However, sometimes on the weekends they get super busy, so make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"We absolutely love eating at Sammys! We are there at least once a week. The service is always fantastic and the food is always yummy! The beer selection is our favorite though. The draft list is constantly changing which gives us an opportunity to try new beers weekly!"}
{"text":"This place is loud but it's not a first date kind of place. The food is very good my fav (when they have it) is the beer can chicken. The burgers are very good also, can't go wrong here just understand it can get loud."}
{"text":"I was in Belmont getting my hair cut an meet some friends or dinner we actually tried a ew places on the same street but they were busy or loud. This place looked perfect we had to wait not even 10 mins an we were seated.  The menu has a wide range of selections from burgers to wraps to lasagna :) I ordered the fried pickles yum they did not disappoint they were the spears very crispy an served with ranch I like to call that the southern gravy lol I ordered the turkey Reuben on Rye with a side of fried Okra. The Reuben was hugeeeee I couldn't eat it all , now the okra when I say fry it hard that means crispy no soft inside. They didn't do good job on my Okra but the pickles an sandwich were delish.  I did save room for their desert now some are just ordered from their regular food vendor but the Apple pie ala mode was amazing mmm I'll be back again. If your passing through this cute little down stop in grab a bite an they also have a bar if you wanna catch a bite to eat an watch a game :)"}
{"text":"Great pub food. Really good beer selection. Everything I've tried at Sammy's has been great and the staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to try Sammy's  on a whim. Suprisingly busy on a Wednesday, we were able to get a table pretty quickly. The bartender Nikki was very friendly. We ordered a chicken wings, a burger  and a Chipotle chicken sandwich. 
The wings were Perfection!!!! We have been looking for a place to get wings and will definitely order them again! My burger was good, but a little too well done and his sandwich was pretty good. Only complaint was the wings came out literally 30 seconds before the meal.
My husband also order the pie alamode that he said was pretty good. So all in all a good meal, good/friendly service, at a good price...... i would just specify that i don't  want my burger well done in the future."}
{"text":"So I am going to try the pReview, in where I know I am going to visit an establishment and I anticipate the outcome. Hey, that's how you get to be Elite.

I will be called over to a table by a server entirely too chipper for a Sunday morning, then I will thump down and be fed large quantities of fried pickles and southwest egg rolls. I know I will not want to leave, and hopefully I won't have to leave involuntarily.

Ehh, I've been to Sammy's several times. I am coming back to the area next weekend (6/29/18) to visit friends who have recently purchased their long-coveted home in Belmont. We always go to Sammy's, especially for Hangover brunch. Some amongst us think the Santa Fe burger, with jalapenos & salsa, is what they need after a long night. 

I do not agree. A man needs breakfast, and a Steak & Egg burger with bacon provides the most important part of the most important meal of the day when I'm in Charlotte; namely, hangover brunch.

No hangover brunch is complete with bloodys and mimosas, and Sammy's has good ones with the fresh juice. 

At night, it's a fun place to go and work through the bourbons. Also between each bourbon throw in some shots such as Red-headed Slut, Cheerwine and/or Cherry Lemon Sundrop, I guarantee someone's gonna hurt in the morning.  Usually isn't me."}
{"text":"Tasty food and decent sized beer menu. Good prices and good service. Usually get take out, which is always pretty fast, but enjoy hanging out there and dining in from time to time and grabbing a beer or a glass of wine and dinner with a friend or my family. It's just a nice, low-key kind of a vibe."}
{"text":"I've always had a soft spot for Sammy's when it comes down to it. I've had a lot of firsts at the old pub, and their beer list continues to introduce new ones to me all the time. This place has one of the, if not the, best Moscow Mules I've had. Food portions are always large, which can sometime be a bad thing if you've got no one to share with. Overall, I love the place and it's one of my go-to restaurants."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place after trying it for the first time.  I went on a Sunday and it was packed, but there was no wait to be seated and the service was fantastic.  I had the honey BBQ wings extra crispy and they came out way better than I had even imagined.  I also tried the spaghetti with meat sauce.  It was a huge portion, and it was not bad, but I would definitely get something else such as the nachos instead.  I think that it's better to get pub food there rather than Italian food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places to catch dinner with the kids. Everything we have had has been great and the wait staff is always helpful. Love the large beer selection.  Its kind of loud so don't go expecting a quiet night out. I"}
{"text":"Sammys is a four star type of place the way it's meant to be. I love that don't serve fancy highfalutin food. They have the best wings in town, and have some of the fastest service I've ever seen. Sammy is is the neighborhood bar everybody wish they had. It can get a tad expensive but Worth supporting a local business. You get extremely large portions for the price though."}
{"text":"Family took me here for a pre-birthday dinner.
A new parking lot about half way down a side street to to the left of Sammy's helped eliminate the cluster f**k parking used to be here especially at night.
Arrived around 6:30 pm Friday 3/16/18 and it was already slammin' including a very large party that was leaving as we were being seated.
Our server flew past our table without stopping telling us she would be with us shortly.
While she was not rude, she wasn't very personable either. She didn't smile much and acted like she was always in a rush. Service was ok but nothing above and beyond. My daughter being in the food service industry as well left her a much large tip than I would have if I had been paying.
They claim an \"extensive\" selection of beers but did not have one my favorites Good Morning Vietnam. Wife waited a long time for her beer sample which they charge 75 cents for. Really?? 75 cents for a shot glass of beer is nickel and diming some one if you ask me.
Also if you order a flight they do not label them so if you really like one or two or all of the beers, how do you know which ones are which???
Food came out pretty fast for as busy as they were.
Wife, daughter and granddaughter said their meals were good, but I have to agree with my son-in-law that our bacon cheese burgers were dry and no where near as juicy as we would have liked for them to be. I don't know what happened. The last time I had a burger here it was really good and juicy. Not even close this time.
I had a good dinner with the family, but I don't think the food or the service was no where near as good as previous visits, that along with the higher prices gets them dropped from 4 to 3 stars only because I can not give them 2 1/2 stars. The only reason I did not give them 2 stars was because my wife, daughter and granddaughter said their food was good.
I'm a little gun shy now after this visit, with the higher prices, the dry burgers and the rushed server, I will have to think long and hard if we will ever make a return visit to Sammy's"}
{"text":"My brother loves sammys and has been going for many years. I finally got to experience it and what a great experience it was. I went for a burger and fries. The burger was delicious and the fries were great too. Service is great and I love this location. Very cool place! Will be back the next time I'm in Belmont."}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant in a nice little town. I had the BBQ platter and was it large! The BBQ sauce given to me was a sweet vinegar maybe. It was good. Had the beer sampler to try 4 different kinds. They sat us in a little table kind of stuffed on the corner. Turns out to be the best seat in the place. Windows all around to see the goings on in the town."}
{"text":"A really fun, and comfortable neighborhood tavern. Food was great, I had blackened chicken on a special salad of the day. It was awesome! Best part of the evening is the bartender Nikki, attentive, remembers your name, and provides a first class experience!"}
{"text":"Good shrimp Po boy, Good beer selection. Worth a try if your in Belmont."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a definite spot you should hit if you are in the Belmont Area.  I have been going to Sammy's for more than 10 years, for food and drinks, and their live music.  It is a true pub, with good beers and great food.  The service is always on point and you will definitely get to know the regulars/locals if you get a seat at the bar.
Sammy's is a great spot to watch a game or just meet up with friends on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"Slow service doesn't even begin to describe it. 12:20 Saturday lunch. 10 minutes to get incorrect bottle of beer. 10 more minutes to get the correct bottle. 15 minutes for chips and salsa. Probably 40 minutes to get the food which was good. We had party of 7 without any special order. Parties of similar size were seated at same time. They ordered, ate and paid before our food came. Sammy, you're not going to see me again. John Taffer's head would have fallen off his shoulders from so much shaking if he witnessed the service."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Saturday for a late lunch after going to the white water rafting center so we were starving and this place did not disappoint.  There were four of us so we got to try a fair amount of stuff.  The service was excellent and the place itself looked like it has been very well taken care of, very clean.  The beer selection was way better than I expected for being so far from downtown, they even had the Avery  Maharaja which you rarely find in a bar, I give them a star just for that!

The fish and chips was excellent especially since they use flounder instead of a generic whitefish you get at a lot of places.  All in all the main dishes were really good.  The mixed vegetable side was over cooked so if you like soggy vegetables this is your spot.  The fries were average at best too.  If they had better sides I would give this place five stars for sure.  The portions were really good for the price and the service was great."}
{"text":"Tried Sammy's tonight for the first time after someone recommended it to me. I have to say I'm not impressed nor will I be back I don't think. I went with my mom and nephew and ordered the Philly cheesesteak after the waitress recommended it and a few other items. There was no flavor or seasoning at all. I also asked if they had onion rings since it wasn't on the side menu and she said yes. I ate about half of my sandwich out of pure hunger and not even half of the just okay onion rings. When the waitress asked if I wanted a box I said no and she never even asked if I enjoyed it. I wish I would've told her how bad it was. She tried to charge me $2 for the onion rings even though it wasn't on the menu and she didn't tell me there was an upcharge. Finally she told me she wouldn't charge me for them. Overall the service was okay, she didn't do anything wrong but the meal was no bueno. I just hate spending hard earned money on food that's just ok and something I could've made better at home. Use some seasoning for goodness sake!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th visit to Sammy's and decided to post a review.  I really like the atmosphere at Sammy's.  Nice neighborhood restaurant/bar feel.  I had the fish and chips -- was OK even though the menu states that it is a favorite.  The breading was cornmeal versus flour.  If you prefer cornmeal, you may really like their fish and chips.  I prefer flour.  I am giving the restaurant a 2 star review for 2 main reasons.  Our waitress smelled like a smokestack.  She must have just went outside and smoked a cigarette.  For non-smokers like me, it was very offensive.  The 2nd reason is that the food this time was marginal -- sweet potato fries were sitting for quite sometime and I had to ask for the typical condiments that accompany fish and chips -- tarter sauce, malt vinegar, etc...  

I will go back as I like the atmosphere, and will change my review if I find it different the next time."}
{"text":"The fried pickles were great . The Philly Cheesesteak was on point. The wait staff was wonderful very helpful."}
