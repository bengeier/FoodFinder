{"text":"Been going to Gentiles for years now when they were in old Brooklyn. Was so excited to see them move to Parma on broadview rd. since it is a 2 min drive from my house now. Some of our favorites are: Hot ham and cheese sandwich, meatball sub, all the focaccia pizzas. Their pizza is great, but love their sheet pizza better. Soft homemade dough, so fluffy and warm! While the Stromboli is a little pricy and they require a 2 hr notice, you really need to splurge on it sometime. Probably the best Stromboli I've had, puts all those pizza joints to shame. Loaded with meats and cheese, again fluffy and warm, not the greasy flat stuff from pizza places. It's big too so will serve a lot of people."}
{"text":"Purchased a cake for my mom from the grandkids and she absolutely loved it..it was delicious..I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for some specialty pasta, pancetta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and some cannolis. So pleased! :) They didn't have bucatini, but there were plenty of other options, so no complaints. The pizza looked delicious. I'll be back to try it."}
{"text":"For years I used to drive by this place daily without stopping in to check it out. (Up until few years ago.) Now I have a hard time passing without going in. 
 Pizza/Subs are great... Deli is awesome.... And it scares me that this joint is so close to to my home.
 Today, I ordered a few orders of spaghetti and meatballs. (Dinner.. Comes w/ salad, Garlic bread.) I swear the to-go bag weighed 5+lbs. I could only eat about a quarter of mine and I was freagn stuffed. (Very good.) 
  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch & great for large orders. Everything I have had has been delish. The staff is always friendly and accommodating . There's a little area to eat inside! I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Great walnut brownies! And homemade meals you can buy and eat at home."}
{"text":"I have been going to Gentile's Deli since they first opened in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood in Cleveland awhile back. 

Goods:
- Fresh bread is awesome, nice crusty fresh bread.
- Great selection of deli meats from standards to imported
- Order a pizza or just buy the dough and make your own
- My wife loves their lasagna
- Real pepperoni
- Fresh italian sausage 
- Prices
-Desserts
- Service - always friendly and quick

They just moved to Parma, still on Broadview so the drive is another 5 minutes from my house, but well worth the time. They have been a staple in my weekly shopping trip for awhile now and I don't see that changing anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich tray and some pizza for a birthday party, and was very impressed.  The sandwiches were just the right size and the presentation on the platter was really nice.  I wish I had taken a photo.  The leftover sandwiches are still good 2 days later even.  The pizza was better than average too.  The best part was the value of the sandwich platter - $4.50 per person for a sandwich, potato or macaroni salad (huge portion), plates, forks, napkins, and serving utensils.  I have been looking around, and have yet to find a better deal."}
{"text":"Good food but very rude staff. Unfortunately, we won't be stopping back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for five years and never tried this place. I believed it was part of the funeral home next door for a long time. One day I was looking for a sub sandwich and received this suggestion. I went it to give it a try and didn't even end up leaving with a sub. I was so shocked at the store, deli, and bakery inside that I didn't make it past the cookies and ended up buying a bunch of Italian butter cookies. They were very delicious and I will absolutely be going back to try more of their baked goods as well as their hot and cold foods."}
{"text":"I work close to Gentiles, and I am always looking for a quick place to grab some food that isn't Fast Food. Gentiles often comes up in my mind as the best place around. The food is absolutely amazing, great portions that you can often split into a second meal, and the prices are amazing. The employees seem like a great big family (which I think a lot of them are) and they are always willing to help. If you are not sure what to get or what comes on a specific dish, they are glad to let you know and help you choose. Their service is is worth the 5 stars alone and the people there are happy to help and amazing to talk with. Real people, not drones behind a counter trying to push as many people as possible back out the door.

Personally I have not tried a dish that I have not loved. I have gotten their Turkey, Prosciutto, Bazzard, Meatball and Italian Sausage subs. I have gotten their BLT [extra crispy bacon on Italian bread makes it the best around]. I have tried their spicy pizza, normal sausage pizza, arugula and prosciutto pizza. I have eaten their Macaroni, Potato and Artichoke salads. I have also tried their stuffed peppers, lasagna, rigitoni and their chef salad. All of it, every single dish, absolutely amazing and like grandma makes it. In fact, you can see Mrs. Gentile (The store grandma) in the back cooking and directing on most days.

Now lets discuss my favorite part, the deserts. They have an absolutely amazing desert area with delicious cookies, cakes, and eclairs. They hand fill cannoli on the spot, and they have the most amazing tiramisu. If you have a sweet tooth, you can't leave the place without getting something outstanding from their selection."}
{"text":"My personal favorite hands down some of the best sandwiches in town muffulota and the bazaard are my favorites ones  don't forget a couple pieces of focaccia  to go mmmmm  just texting this is making want to go get some more of there grub"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and boy, was I surprise how good this place is.

If you are ever near this place, this is a MUST go to place.

Clean, friendly and the food is amazingly good for such an affordable price. 

Definitely worth the five star."}
{"text":"Gargantuan Gentile's Batman!  Their huge deli sub's are fully loaded and delicious!  Did the Pick 3 meats w/ Pastrami, Corned Beef and Honey Turkey. Plus Havarti, tomato, lettuce & Roasted Red Peppers!  Potato salad was very good & only $2/lb.  And after 3pm they have half sheets for $10.  Nicely topped w/ cheese and lotsa sauce. 
They also offer Gelato!"}
{"text":"The best paczki I've ever had.  Not sure if its traditional, but their paczki were split like a hamburger bun and filled with the most decadent creams.  We had custard, butter cream and chocolate.  YUM!  I usually come for the pastas and pancetta.  Now I will be here for every Fat Tuesday, from this day forward."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.   I had driven by a few times before Gentile's opened in this location and added to the list of places that I wanted to try.   The place is a combination bakery, deli, takeout, italian grocery.   The space is big, shelves are well stocked and staff is very nice.  I ordered a cold italian sub and a nice selection of kolatchy cookies.   I also bought a bag of Zapp's kettle chips to go with my sandwich.  There was a large selection of hot and cold sandwiches, salads and pizza options available.  The sandwich was served on a large, fresh, crusty sub roll filled with a wonderful combo of freshly sliced italian meats, provolone cheese, fresh lettuce and banana peppers.   The sandwich was huge and very, very tasty.   I tried the cookies once I got home and they were also fresh and tasty.    I will definitely return to Gentile's for itallian groceries, sandwiches, and bakery!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches around, great antipastas too!! Cold Italian is the best sub in town!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian stores in the Cleveland area.  Homemade wedding soup, bread, subs, pizza, desserts, prepared foods, etc. The wedding soup is one of my favorites and I love the sicilian style pizza.  The bread is amazing! Clean store, family run, with a place to eat in the back for lunch/dinner. Good prices for hot foods."}
{"text":"Relatively new to the area and decided it was time to try Paczki. Delicious! The staff were very helpful. Every person that saw me asked if I had been helped. I will be back soon to try the pizza as the smell was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time today.

Small selection of groceries for pasta and Italian dishes. Some imported Italian wine, beer..

A deli, bakery and food to order. Pizza, subs, soups. They have pizza already made around $2/slice. Subs are around $6. Pizza is pretty good. I had the Bazzard sandwich which was also ok but to be honest it reminded me of a grinder from Tiffany's Pizza (in Garfield Heights) and if I had to choose I would choose the grinder. My mom stops here every once in a while to get Italian wedding soup so it must be decent from here. Overall it was an ok experience. Can't say I'm in a hurry to come back and can't say I would never come back. Maybe if in the area and in the mood for some pizza it would be a good, quick stop."}
{"text":"I had Gentiles cater my wedding & I have to say their pricing on food is reasonable. NOT ON CAKES THOUGH. The cake she made tasted amazing, but I wasn't impressed with how the design & tiers turned out ! At a little over $4 a person...I expect PERFECTION. The top tier was crooked & the \"flowerettes\" weren't what I expected. Plus the way she suggested that it be designed made the middle & top tier look too close in size. Also, the only person there that can even ball park cake pricing is the woman who makes them. Moving on, I asked for extra sauce w/ the pan of pasta I ordered. I wasn't told there was a charge. I was left a voicemail which I didn't listen to until after my date ($7.00). Most of the food was really good. .chicken was moist..EXCEPT the cheese raviolis. They had spots on them like freezer burn ? Best way to describe it. The flavor was not there for me. Others liked them. (1.00 per rav).."}
{"text":"They added gelato over the summer and it is worth any price they want to charge. They've also added some seating inside as well.

Deli selections are still some of the best around (hello prosciutto de parma under $20/#). Wide range of prepared foods, from meatballs, to lasagna, to olive blends, to everything Italian. Bread is made on premises and is very good and priced well. And of course there's the take out food, which is among the best in the Cleveland area. Dry pasta selections blow away the groceries around here.

Oh and they make the best pumpkin roll  ($9), hands down."}
{"text":"Okay if you don't feel like driving over to the east side but need DELISH Italian?
GENTILE'S!!!!!!

Seriously...Not gonna lie...It's gotta be the best kept secret for Italian on the west side!!!!
They do their own curing with their procuitto and I'll tell you it's every bit as good as the imported from Parma...
I swear if I stood there any longer I was going to explode with all the samples the deli guy was feeding me...
I think it was the \"We make our own food so we want to show it off\"  phenomenon...
Okay...I'm in!!!! I was full the rest of the day! Okay another lie, I was hungry as soon as I got home and dove in to all the meat I bought...
They have everything from pizza by the slice to WONDERFUL bakery to retail Italian to well yeah, AWESOME deli products!!!

So if you find yourself in my neck of the woods and felling a bit peckish but wanna take home...Hit Gentiles up!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! The gelato is also really good...a little pricey but good for a splurge every once in a while."}
{"text":"I work near Gentiles and oh man does is smell good in the mornings when they start to bake the bread and pizza. The pizza is hands down one of the best in town. They sell by slice too. The deli is always fresh and the staff is so nice! The offer catering for a decent price."}
{"text":"I just had ANOTHER Culinary  Experience.
I was at Gentile's Italian Deli & Bakery, Saturday, & The second you walk in you are greeted with an assortment of flavorful aromas & then some of the most Beautifully presented Italian Treasures. 
At the Deli counter the Attractive  ALWAYS smiling, knowledgeable & helpful Tommie is helping me decide on a few of the many fresh prepared items on display & what ingredients are in the dishes. Thank You Tommie.
I've had nothing but Great Service from Every Gentile's Associate I had the pleasure to react with.
The store is ALWAYS CLEAN, display cases are spotless, counter tops clean number one test, the restroom, was beautifully maintained.
Check out was fast, friendly. 
There is No Need to go to 
Little Italy anymore. 
I will be a regular customer here.
Continued Success to You & a 
Very Happy New Year to All of You"}
{"text":"There's no longer a need to go to Little Italy for you Italian bakery and food cravings!

The Bakery
From cookies to pies to cakes to bread. They have everything! You can get your cookies in larger batches or, if you're like me and want a bit of a snack, you can get a few in a little box and you're all set! The cookies do change out so there's no guarantee that the ones you want will be there on a daily basis but it's alright - there are so many other choices or come back the next day and there's a good chance they'll be back! The cookies are normally priced around $13.99 a pound, the price being pretty standard to that of the bakeries in Little Italy I think.

The Deli
There's meats, cheeses and salads by the pound and all of it delicious.

The Carry Out
You can order pizza, hot subs, cold subs, lasagna, soups and salads. My personal favorite are the focaccia pizzas - they have them in personal sizes so one or two for lunch and there's no chance you'll be hungry until dinner. Plus I've found them to be good hot and cold. Also I didn't see it on their menu but if you happen to see that they have Arancini di Riso out you should get them immediately. Italian rice balls with mozarella cheese. What more could you ask for? They also have day old pizzas and other bits and pieces on sale next to the register.

The Store
Yes you read correctly, there is a small grocery store inside with many of the basic ingredients you need to embark on your Italian recipes.

The Staff
Everyone who's ever helped me out has been incredibly pleasant. There's a friendly atmosphere, even in the kitchen visible through open-air-like windows behind the register. You will never leave this place with a frown!

The Parking
When looking at the store front your first reaction may be, \"why are there like 7 parking spots?\" Not to worry because behind the building is a massive parking lot. There's a convenient entrance into the establishment from that side so you don't have to walk around the building at all!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Gentiles in probably 15 years. Why?? I live right around the corner!! I got the Bazzard and My Hubby got the meatball sub, we also got a large Wedding soup to share, we will be here atleast once a week or more for lunch because it was that good!!"}
{"text":"-Fresh And Delicious-

Today, my boss bought the department where I work some lasagna and garlic bread from Gentile's Bakery. I am surprised I've never heard of this place before.

I'm not a huge lasagna fan, in fact, I almost dislike it. I'm overly picky about how soggy or crispy lasagna can be. I've had good lasagna, but never outstanding. Gentile's lasagna was fantastic, cooked to perfection. It was an outstanding surprise that I've finally had lasagna worth my time. We got a take-out order and everything still seemed very hot and fresh. It was packed into a container with plastic wrap over (so it wouldn't spill while being carried or transported), which was a nice touch.

The garlic bread tasted good as well. It was different than what I'm used to (the oven-ready garlic bread you buy in the store), but that's not to say it was bad. I would describe the garlic bread as having an almost rustic feeling to it.

I didn't go to pick up the order, so I can't judge the service or staff. I believe I could find it safe to assume that they take great pride in what they do and would probably be pleasant to talk to."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy. The restaurant offers a variety of Italian food e.g. pizza, subs, side dishes, gelato, and more. My boyfriend and I got subs which were by far the best sub I've ever eaten! We also tried to pistachio gelato! If you're in the area you should definitely check out the restaurant. Gentile's Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great deli, delicious foods and very good value, always made fresh breads and variety of choices here.  Mmmmmmm, good stuff."}
{"text":"Now that's Italian!!!  Why aren't you here?  Pasta. Desserts.  Bread.  Sauce.  So nicea"}
{"text":"I have been going to Gentile's ever since I was a kid. we have followed them around as their location has changed a few times over the years--the original location was on Ridge Road in Parma, they were in a second location on Broadview Road in Old Brooklyn, and now they are back in Parma on Broadview Road. I stopped into grab a sandwich for lunch and some giardiniera. It was still pretty crowded with people ordering lunch after the typical lunch rush around 1:30pm. I went with a cold Italian. The sandwich was piled high with layers of cold cuts and cheese. It was rather large, and half of it was enough to stuff me! The giardiniera was on the pricer side at almost $7, but I live in an area where they don't sell giardiniera, so I was willing to pay it. Their bread is awesome, and as a child, nothing could get better than topping it with Nutella. My mouth is watering just thinking about Gentile's now!"}
{"text":"Delicious bread! Sadly, when I got home my two pounds of Italian sausage was grey and smelled spoiled which means it was sitting around too long. 
I threw it out, which is what the store should have done. I will miss the bread but will not be back."}
{"text":"I love Gentile's Bakery.  The pizza & everything on the food menu is awesome!  Mrs. Gentile's bread rolls are the best ever and we always had them growing up.  Everything is fresh.  The pepperoni bread is so good.  The family is super nice and I've known them since I was a kid.  I love walking in with my kids and snatching some pizza out of the case and we'll eat it right there.  Always bringing dad some home!  This is a must try!  I'm so glad their place is even bigger than the last location."}
{"text":"I've completely forgotten about this place, right across the street from Steve's. Although I wouldn't drive out of the neighborhood to here, this is worth a stop if you're in Old Brooklyn. 

It's a nice Italian bakery, deli, and food import store. There's a few It's not very large, the size of a classroom. 

I finally had their pizza a few days ago. At $14 for a plain large pizza, it's pricier than some other pizza shops but the quality and taste are noticeably better. The pizza had mozzarella and some other cheese in it (my dad guessed provolone), wasn't burned at all, and the sauce wasn't salty or sweet like many other budget pizza shops in the area that all taste the same. It's a family business so they close a bit early (around 6 or 7p) and there's no delivery.

If I needed to bring something from Old Brooklyn to a yelp potluck or something with foodies, I'd probably stop here, as long as they were open."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite bakery in Parma.  The sandwiches are so fresh and the canolis are freshly filled when ordering.  I also love the Gelato bar with the patio in the summer.  I wish they would add a bike stand and play music on the patio."}
{"text":"The tomato and garlic pizza is amazing. The bakery is so so but everything else is awesome"}
{"text":"Best pizza by the slice, and a awesome meatball sub!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. True Italian cooking by an Italian family. Frequently get their hot subs and pizza and am never disappointed. I have shared this place with friends and family and have never had anyone disappointed. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"They catered a graduation party for me and everyone LOVED the food!   Ordered chicken piccata , roast beef , cavatelli, roasted potatoes and a few other items.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"I visited Gentiles for the first time on a recommendation from a friend.  I walked in looking for grocery items and was expecting a Galluccis atmosphere, but it was not comparable.  They had a good selection of pasta, tomatoes and other canned goods, but I needed a little more selection so I set down my grocery basket.

I walked over to the counter to check out olives and while I was talking to the lady, another worker walked up and completely interrupted me. It was the most rude thing I've ever seen as a customer, I was shocked. I think she could tell I was shocked, so she asked if she could help me. I said no and turned to walk away. 
I was even more surprised that she let me walk out. I've worked in retail and restaurants and I would never let anyone walk out of my store empty handed and agitated without trying!

Anyone that has ever talked about this place says the food is so good. I would have loved to try again and improve their rating, but after the service I won't be returning.

I gladly turned my business over to Chuppa's Marketplace."}
{"text":"I knew this would not be a Jewish deli with a name like Gentile's. A guy I work with actually found out it is pronounced \"Jen-til-ees\" so you won't have to make that mistake. The food here is excellent. The ordering system could use some fine tuning. It has been a little chaotic at times during lunch. That doesn't really bother me too much because I am never in a rush to return to work. The Italian sausage is great. They usually run a sandwich special at lunch for $5 and that cannot be beat. And people still end up going to Subway for unknown reasons. The square pizza slices are decent and filling. They also have a nice selection of grocery items including olives, pre-made meals and Boar's Head deli meats. This is a great place to stop and eat lunch right outside the soulless strip of Rockside Rd. I have told a few people that I work with about this place and they all rave about it."}
{"text":"The food is great quality and very flavorful.  You can tell it's authentic Italian.  The service could be better, though.  I went in to order four subs for my family members and I.  I gave the employee the list written out.  She acted very inconvenienced by the fact that she had to make four subs.  I must also add that I was the only person there at the time.  If you can get past the rude staff, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Although they don't brag about it on their website they have an excellent variety of freshly baked loaves of Italian breads in all shapes and sizes. Delicious when dipped warm in their homemade seasoned olive oil they sell.

They also sell a variety of dry pasta you will be hard pressed to find at your local supermarket.
For instance, sometimes pappardelle is hard to find. Theirs is excellent and if I remember rightly more than a pound in a bag. Friendly people working here also."}
{"text":"This place is just about as good as it gets. My husband has been coming here his entire life. They have everything. Pizza, breads, pastas, deserts, and today I tried their wedding soup. I have been feeling under the weather with no appetite but knew I needed a homemade soup for lunch. Gentiles came to mind and I zoomed on over. I ate the entire bowl! So good! This will be my new lunch spot! Everything you get here is quality and amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here before when they were in old Brooklyn. Got the meatball sub. Fresh Italian bread huge meatballs in the bread with homemade sauce and cheese. My favorite Eastside meatball sub is at Gallucci's but now this is the place I go to for meatball sub on the Westside. They have other Italian groceries here along with fresh made pizza and desserts. They also do catering. This is a must try for local Italian on Westside."}
