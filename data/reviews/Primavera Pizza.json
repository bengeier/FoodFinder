{"text":"Pizza was ok, mozzarella sticks not too great, tiramisu was partially frozen. I asked for ranch twice (with the pizza and again with the mozzarella sticks) and didn't get any. Probably won't order here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Family owned, and they are always super nice. Delivery is always really fast. Prices are good. Quality of food is really good for the prices. We tried another place one time and regretted it. We always order from primavera now. Our favorite pizza around"}
{"text":"We received the wrong salad...ordered a garden salad, was delivered a Caesar salad. They brought ranch dressing with the Caesar salad. Not enough marinara for the Calzone and doesn't taste all that good. And the gyro bread was soggy (gross!) 
Won't be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"Wow!! The food is excellent. I ordered the penne with meatballs..it had a nice kick to the sauce, huge meatballs and a huge portion all together. My boyfriend had the philly which was also delecious too..kinda small but taste wise it was well worth it. Only 30 minutes to deliver as well. Definitely ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"The service here is the best we have recieved at a restaurant in a long time. The pizza is good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza with one topping, and 4 garlic knots. The slices were very small, the pie was burnt. It had no flavor, and the garlic knots sucked. Parsley all over them. The marinara  sauce  to dip the garlic knots in had no taste. Everything was really terrible !!!!   Then I  paid with a debit card. They said hold on. If you wanna give a tip enter the amount now. I felt kinda uncomfortable when they asked for a tip. Especially on a walk in order to go. I can see if I sat in their restaurant and ate. But it was a take out order. That's kinda rude to ask a customer for a tip. On a take out order. I hated everything about this place.  I'm never going back there. And I work at a local hotel. I'm going to tell all of my residents never to order from this place.  $20 for a medium pie and 4 garlic knots. Never Again...."}
{"text":"0 out of 10 for customer service. We tried to order online to receive the 15% off online discount, as advertised on their menu, but got a message that said the store was closed. Called in and the employee told us they must have  forgotten to turn it on?No big deal, so we waited a few minutes and tried again (dumb of me to assume the employee might try to fix the issue?) and still no go. I called in again, the employee was unapologetic and unwilling to honor the discount or even talk to a manager to see if there was anything that could be done. She was curt, unprofessional, and unfriendly. As a manager in customer service, I was pretty surprised at how awful the employee did taking my phone call/order. Delivery took 45 minutes. Portions were good, food was disappointing. Not really surprised though... Had pasta bolognese and Alfredo."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza we've had since moving to Charlotte.  The wings were good too - nice and crispy and not over sauced.  Local owned by a very nice woman and her son - they were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. We did not receive all the items in our order and they were not willing to fix it AND they did not give us a refund for the item. So basically they stole from us.

The two pizzas they did deliver were burnt and the sandwich we ordered was bland and accompanied by soggy French fries. 

AVOID THIS PIT. MANY BETTER OPTIONS."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery because we had just moved here and didn't know where anything was. We ordered the white pizza and the spinach calzone. The food was absolutely amazing! and the guy who delivered it was nice."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here several times. The food is delicious, my favorite so far is the BLT. Always delivered within 40 minutes and packed nice and hot! The delivery guys are also polite."}
{"text":"Not sure about their other choices, but their pizza is first rate. I've had pies all over the world, including in the self-proclaimed Mecca of pizza: NYC. Primavera's pie was simple but just right: excellent crust, they don't over do the sauce like a lot of joints in the U.S. Just a good basic pie."}
{"text":"Nice lady...first time here so I tried a couple of slices....good size slice, plenty of toppings just lacked cheese and sauce...Pizza was actually dry and I was there first thing...first time I've had a pizza with more toppings than cheese and sauce...get the Philly...going to try it next."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic but the Philly Cheesesteak is the best you'll have in the Charlotte area. My wife and I just moved to Mathews and we hit this place 5 to 6 times a month..check it out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered thru Eat24 and they never showed up.  Tried to call for info they don't answer their phone goes to voicemail.  Left us very hungry and angry after working all day and no dinner.  Order had been confirmed too...last time I order from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great find for our soccer team today. Huge portions, quality ingredients and nice service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Service with a smile Food was excellent especially for the price will be back Loved it and the location"}
{"text":"First time I order from this pizzeria and their pizza is so good, full loaded with toppings, delivery is ok not to quick but I understand this place is busy.
I love their Italian sub, that is real sub not with pepperoni, in most pizzeria das."}
{"text":"Last night in town and decided to check this place out. Decided to check Groupon and saw a Groupon offer. Called and asked if they were accepting the Groupon, was told yes. Bought Groupon and placed order. Almost 15 minutes later, we received a call stating they would not accept. When asked to speak with a manager was told they're not there. Which didn't make sense since she said she was just told they're not taking Groupons. She then stated the manager is busy working. To which I replied to go get them. She said they were not there. This turned into an argument and she hung up on me. Horrible customer service. Needless to say I have contacted Groupon, placed my complaint, and received refund."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with a friendly staff that constantly keeps me coming back.  Even if pizza isn't your preference they have so much more on the menu that your guaranteed to find something you like.  I live in charlotte now but primavera is so good I find myself making a special trip to matthews just for some primavera."}
{"text":"THE place for NY style pizza!! Tastes & feels like it's made with love by Grandma!! That's how this sweet, beautiful lady makes her pizzas! We've had other pizzas since our first time here and we ALWAYS end up comparing them to Primavera Pizza. ALL of the others fall short. But let's talk Garlic Knots!!! Someone's review called them \"crack\". Really? Over garlic knots? YES! YES! YES! You've GOT to try them to believe them. I've found myself planning what to cook for dinner just so I have an excuse to stop and get some to go WITH dinner!!! Warning...be sure & get enough or there WILL be some elbowing at the dinner table."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza. We ordered the supreme which I really enjoyed.  My wife made her own and it was great. The crust is our favorite part. Crunchy but light and airy. This is our new pizza place for sure. The service was great and they tell you to make yourself at home and just fill up your soda when needed.  This is great for someone like me that drinks a lot. We will continue to come here. We also ordered delivery from here and the pizza was great too."}
{"text":"This place is great - it's close to my house, so I picked up a large pizza with 1-topping for $8.59! I read some of the reviews, so I wondered if it would be okay, but I was really glad I took the chance. My family loved it, the kids couldn't get enough, and when the wife is happy, I'm happy! The pizza was perfect - hot and tasty. 
The owners were friendly, too. 
I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Purchased a delivery order, Meatball app, Philly Cheese Steak, and onion rings. Meatballs were mealy and mushy. Doubt they were pan friend before being put in the sauce. Philly steak was tasty although probably frozen meat. Onion rings we're greasy but still quite good, crispy with flavorful seasoning in the breeding. I'll try it again sometime, maybe just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Had a margherita pizza and garlic knots for takeout.  A little slow on delivery but good quality good"}
{"text":"True, it's not NY pizza (if you think so, you've never actually eaten a slice in the city) but it's still good. We got the lasagna pie and it was very unique and delicious. The red sauce had something special in it, very good, I just wish there was more on the pie. Maybe on a cheese you get more, will have to try it next. Great find in Matthews, right down the street from our apartment, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's see! Haven't had there pizza. So don't know about it. Im from Chicago.  Ii went in order a gyros plate. Pretty sure the meat was frozen.  Wasnt anything like the meat being cut fro the spit im used to back in northern illinois. Portion was a third the size a Normal GREEK would give. Of course the employees were mexican so thats that. DONT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite semi-regular places to order pizza from for take-out or dining in.  Out-of-the way location, but if you find it it's a good alternative to the chains.  Just wish they'd add some live music!"}
{"text":"I order from them all the time and is always been very good.I can't get enough of that pizza.I also love the homemade tzatziki sauce. I was also reading the reviews and I don't understand why you write a review only when something goes wrong."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza today for lunch for my staff and it was great!

The gentleman taking my order over the phone was patient, methodical and very efficient.  He didn't rush me and was helpful with sizing for a group.  

I asked them to deliver it at a certain time and he was here ON THE DOT.  In person he was even more kind and considerate than he was on the phone.

The pizza was great, the salads were fresh and their dressings were delicious.

Thanks for making my little staff so happy today!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and stromboli   loved the crust

Next up the philly wit wiz or what? Was easy to get to and fresh food took maybe 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, very good food! Best pizza spot for anything off the menu (even the salads are huge and fresh.) Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good subs. Fries weren't greasy. Very clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"Catching up on reviews finally.

Ok, 1st, anybody claiming this is NY Style Pizza has no clue what NY Style Pizza is.

Period. 45+ years of eating ny pizza and every other pizza/cuisine/food in NY, in the south and all over the world, I think I know what Im talking about.

While not NY Style...not even close honestly. It is quite good/unique. Especially here in the south.

It reminds me more of being in France and entering in to one of many establishments that advertise 'NY Style Pizza'.

Nope, not 'NY Style'. But still quite good. Quite unique. Easy to find this 'style of ny pizza' overseas. But hard to find here in the U.S.

It does have the the thin quality, but thats where the similarity ends. 

The crust, cheese etc, is far more European in style.

No stretchy globs of mozzarella. No need for an extra napkin to soak up the wonderful NY liquids dripping off your slice.

A soft, flaky very European crust, Almost pastry like. Widespread overseas, but rare here in the U.S, especially in charlotte.

Its not a chain. It is a mom and pop shop. Mostly Mom (nora) and her son. Nora is from Europe. Hence the European flair to their food.

Both terrifically nice friendly enjoyable people. Whether your a regular or first timer, you will be treated the same...as family....

The location is good...sort of hidden...but sort of not...easily and quickly accessible once you know where they are.

To the food which is of course the main thing. No, as said, not NY Style Pizza and anybody who says it is NY Style has no clue. Its 'European NY Style', which is vastly different then wandering around Brooklyn eating true NY Style Pizza.

But that doesnt mean its not good. In fact, I would rec anybody go there and give it a try without hesitation.

There are not many pizzas like this available here.

I personally would like a little more flavor in the sauce. With that, Id give 5 stars. Just a tad bland....But, that flaky, pastry crust is awesome and I suspect if you asked for a tad more zest, they would accommodate you, and if not, the crust alone makes it a regular stop on your weekly dining trip that you, your kids and family should greatly enjoy and look forward to.

The Calzones, Stromboli, Rolls and etc are good. Rather large (you wont leave hungry) and of course like everything they make, its all homemade. The above have the same delicious European pastry like homemade goodness the pizzas have.

The main dishes, again, all 4 star...all delicious...pasta is typically al dente as all pasta should be....The garlic knots are quite good, close to 5 stars....

The only thing holding me back from an overall 5 star rating is the rave reviews for the 'best philly cheese steak' in NC reviews.

OK, so Im spoiled. I expected more. Mind you, I was not disappointed, I just had my bar set too high. It was a 3.75-4 star sub just based on the bread and meat. I just expected a fuller, heartier sub with the green peppers, onions and etc to stand out, not be hard to find/taste.

However, I also know the next time I order the Philly Sub, which I will soon, I will ask Nora for xtra Green peppers/onions etc to be softly/quickly sauted, not cooked fully and toss them on, and no doubt they will do it and my rating on the philly will likely jump to 5 stars.

If you want true NY style pizza/pasta/dishes, go elsewhere. If you want a delicious Italian pizza/food/bread/meal etc, with a great European flair thats hard to find in this area, head on up to hwy 74/matthews township, visit this place and you'll find it and be glad you did.

as a quick side note, the reason this place has the 'European Flair', is because of Nora's History...its where she's from, her travels and trevairs (sp?) experiences are what make this place a special gem all should try.....You likely won't be disappointed and in case you are, they likely wont let you leave until you are fully satisfied....When everything you make/cook/serve is homemade, there is a lot of leeway to change alter things to your liking....

They will ensure you leave happy and satisfied and looking forward to your next visit...

Happy Eating"}
{"text":"I always like giving restaurants at least one chance. Every other month someone stops by the office to drop off menu's so I finally decided to give Primavera a try despite the reviews. 

I rang them close to my lunch break, it took them 40 minutes to deliver my food which is normal for downtown delivery. The guy who took my order was polite. 

Items ordered:
Gyro lunch special ($6.99)
Cannoli ($2.99)

The lunch special runs Monday-Thursday and includes a soda. When the delivery driver got here, he placed the order on my desk, the bags were tied so I didn't get to open them until he left. In one bag there was a soda, in the other my gyro, but no cannoli or tzatziki sauce. I called Primavera back and told them what I was missing. The same guy who took my order answered and just said \"Oh, wow\", no apology, he just kept on repeating that over and over again and said he would send someone back out, then hung up, no goodbye. Ten minutes later, a different delivery driver drops in and says \"the cook said the tzatziki sauce is in the box. I showed him the box and even lifted up the gyro, no sauce. He apologized, gave me my cannoli and tzatziki, then left. Why would I lie about not getting my sauce? 

The food itself was okay. I ate the majority of the fries while waiting for the tzatziki sauce to arrive. They were semi-warm, a bit soggy, but the seasoning salt they used on the was good. I bet they would have tasted great if they were hot and crispy. On to the gyro, the pita bread was a bit hard, it wasn't soft so I ate around the hard parts, the meat was good though, it was very tender. The tzatizki sauce was good, it wasn't too strong. The cannoli was okay, the filling was very subtle. Overall, I don't think I'd order from Primavera again, there are far better restaurants downtown with better service and food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If God and spaghetti had a baby this would be it. Great pizza, salads, pasta. Owner/ staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Off the main strip of 74, not a lot of traffic. Excellent sausage and pepper calzone. Daughter got the chicken parmesan and a lot to eat. Great service. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a good pizza place that delivered besides Domino's or Pizza Hut. Small places always have the best food, and this place absolutely proved that statement to be true. I ordered a Caesar salad, spaghetti bolognese, and a large pepperoni pizza. The only thing ruining a 5 star rating is the fact that I ordered extra pepperoni and it had no where near what I would call extra. But everything was delicious enough to over look the small imperfections. A must have on pizza night. Love supporting my delicious local businesses like this one."}
{"text":"So I don't live too terribly far from here but unfortunately the yelp reviews have kept me away. Sometimes yelp fails like that...

So tonight I wanted pizza while I stayed in the New Year. I decided to give them a shot and I'm very glad I did. I called up and ordered the Supreme Pizza and a few Meatballs. I could have ordered online, but I wanted to see if the Meatballs were homemade or frozen. Luckily they buy them from a local bakery so I was totally in. They said it would be 25 minutes so I set my timer and had a salad while I waited. I drove on over and was quickly greeted inside.

The lady behind the counter was friendly but it was a bit cold in there. It was still going to be a few minutes but luckily we filled the time with paying and all that jazz. I was a little grateful that I got there a little early as I knew I'd be getting a hot out of the oven pizza. 

I got the meatballs and pizza home and dug into the meatballs while I wanted for my piping hot pizza to cool. The meatballs were big, super yummy and came with tons of marinara. When I finally got to take a bite of the pizza it was warm, gooey, crammed with toppings and YUMMY! My ONLY complaint was that the crust was a bit thick but that isn't their fault. I just like super thin crust so I got over myself. I liked it so much that I ate an entire 10 inch by myself. 

Would I recommend this place? Yes! Will I go back? YES"}
{"text":"This restaraunt is a true diamond in the rough. Five words that will change your life: Get the Philly Cheese Steak. I am by no means a Philly (the sandwich) fan, but this place has changed that. It is easily the most delicious sandwich I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. I don't know why the price has four dollar signs beside it because it's not that expensive and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I love this place it's worth every penny. Vs getting cheap food which sucks.... I'm a regular and they have great customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Eats.

We got mild chicken wings with fries, appetizer sampler plate, and eggplant Parmesan. We also asked for utensil, plates, ranch, etc.

Fried appetizer platter was soggy and tasted like stale, like they twice deep fried old ones.

Chicken wings were just ok. A bit bland n dry and they forgot to give us ranch dipping sauce. Fries were soggy.

They messed up our order of eggplant Parmesan and gave us chicken parm instead. And when I called to tell them the mistake the guy insisted he saw chicken parm in the order. Absolutely not. I ordered eggplant parm for sure. The chicken parm with spaghetti was nothing special. Needed more sauce.

Disappointed that we ordered from here."}
{"text":"The young lady that answered the phone for my delivery order was an air head and I almost hung up. She was distracted and unprofessional on the phone. I kept having to repeat myself...literally I repeated myself over 5 times. She sounded young and she could cost the company great customers. The pizza was good. I got the classic. I am giving the pizza joint 1 star because service, cost and food go hand in hand. I got a small pizza and it cost over $25 bucks?!?!? The food was good but not $25 worth. I think it's a rip off. I'm probably not going to buy there again not because of the cost or taste but because of the air head worker."}
{"text":"I have gotten take out from this pizza place on two separate occasions. They delivered to my location (approximately 4 miles away) within 30 minutes of my order. Each time, I thoroughly enjoyed my purchase. The primavera pizza is hit amongst my friends and I because of the grilled eggplant.

I did not read yelp before ordering, so I did not know of others complaints. Thankfully I gave this place a try without letting reviews skew my opportunity to try something new. If you want something delicious, try the zucchini sticks or jalapeno poppers.

I will definitely be ordering from them again the next time I get a craving for eggplant."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich which came with fries. The sandwich was pretty tasty. It had plenty of meat. I suppose I just wish it had more veggies, but it was still good. The fries were descent, they are lightly salted and tasted fresh. 

I enjoyed the hot wings. Great flavor and I like that they weren't fatty at all. The ranch has a slightly different taste that im not too fond of. 

They included plenty of ranch and my food was all hot when I received it. I also order a BBQ chicken salad which I haven't gotten to yet. However, I am definitely satisfied with my order and will be ordering from here again when I am in town."}
{"text":"We Ordered the Hawaiian burger and made it a double for $1.50 more.  It was very good, wasn't even finished.  I ordered the Italian sub and specified lettuce,mayo, and tomatoes only.  That's exactly how it came.  Very happy about that.  The bread was yummy, soft Italian roll.  The fries on both orders came seasoned with seasoning salt I think.  A nice touch. It did take an hour like they said which is ok, since I live pretty far from the restaurant.  Delivery charges very reasonable.  Overall a good place to order from, nothing fancy but as good as expected, for when I don't wanna cook.  :)"}
{"text":"I m from New York and this place has the Best garlic knots I have ever had.
I wish I was from this place.. would have come down daily for these knots. 
Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is made mostly by one guy, sometimes he will even deliver it after he makes it.  Food is always fresh and delicious.  I love the buffalo chicken calzone and philly cheesesteaks.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I had the Philly Cheese steak.  My husband has the Chicken Parmesan and we split the garlic knots.  The bread was so light, yet perfectly crunchy.  The woman and her son, who own the place are absolutely lovely.  This is one locally owned business we can't wait to come back to.  Now to try the pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pleasant enough, windows with sheer curtains all around, light wood table top and chairs , light tile floors. Small place but it doesn't feel cramped. 

The service seemed organizationally challenged, what with only a pleasant lady from Central Europe and a young guy to answer the phone, cashiering, cooking, taking orders, greeting, getting take out orders ready and serving ... all this in no particular order. Got to admit the Virgo in me was amused , it was like watching the traffic in Rome.   

I had two slices for lunch (see the pix) it was OK , certainly NOT five stars or excellent in any way. It's nothing like NY pizza, tastes leaner and the dough is different as well - too sweet with no salt.

To give it credit the crust wasn't spongy like Brixx @ Foxtrot or the cardboard like from the so called Brooklyn pizza parlor but that amounts to showering it with faint praise, let's say it wasn't bad, the tomato sauce was OK and in my opinion it needed extra cheese. 

I'll probably try this place for dinner one of these days,  I just wish people wouldn't hype their local hole in the wall so much all it does is lead one to disappointment.  REALLY!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is bad.

Ordered from this place two nights in a row with worse service each night. First order last night was delivered late due to the whole order not in he drivers car and he had to go back to pick up one and not everyone's food was hot. Ordered a gyro which was blah but the Philly sand which was really yummy so I thought what the hell I'll try again.  

Second night, I ordered a special  for delivery. Again I'm not given the whole special and the poor delivery guy is sad and confused. Called the company was was told they aren't going to honor their special I ordered and payed for. 


As for the food of everything we had over two days : the gyro was just blah. The Philly sandwich was very yummy. Garlic cheese breed was good.  The pizza crust is cardboard and the sausage is breakfast sausage (barf) not Italian.  Get a better quality from costco. 

I don't recommend. You won't get what you ordered and will be charged"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Cheese pizza and Garlic knots are just ok. Meatballs were horrible. Delivery was convenient but won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food thats perfectly prepared always. Good folks. Recommend the manicotti or chicken parmigiana."}
{"text":"In a city definitely not known for it's italian or any other food for that matter, Primavera Pizza does not help the cause. I ordered Spaghetti with sauce and I felt like I was back at the hospital in the 1980's. Yes, the spaghetti tasted like hospital food. It was greasy, and not tasteful at all. The salad was a few iceburg leaves, with a half assed tomato. My mother had a pre-cooked and frozen lasagna. It was not cheap, and for 2 dinners and tip the bill came out to almost $40.00.... no way, never again. The owners had expressed that they were from Europe, but I know food as bad as this is not served in Europe... maybe that's why they are here."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place now a few times for my own personal pizza eating pleasure [I love the dough and the yummy ingredients used] , however, this time I ordered today for my company, Zappos.com for a small special event and I was not disappointed!

Our headquarters is located in downtown Fremont, and I was catering for a small hungry audience of about 15 people.

It was the first time my coworkers ever tried the pizza, onion rings, chicken wings [yum!], & fries, and let me say, they loved it!

Compliments on the pizza and wings especially!

There were no leftovers and I received many compliments for finger foods I did not make myself!

The delivery showed up just in time before the meeting and I'm very happy this place is located conveniently near where I work and live!

Thank Primavera Pizza and MyPizza.com for the good eats!

:)"}
{"text":"PRETTY GOOD!! ... Delivery was fast and polite, food was hot and not bad at all. I ordered a appetizers sampler and chicken finger. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"They have the best meatballs and spaghetti sauce in Charlotte.  Others are right about them making things from scratch.  The garlic knots are like crack and the atmosphere is very relaxed and family oriented.  I will be back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"I really wanted a good pizza tonight and unfortunately, this fell short. Delivery service was excellent but the pizza just wasn't good. I ordered the spinach pizza which had little flavor and frozen spinach. Better to just not offer it if you are going to use frozen. Cheesecake also tasted frozen. For the price, everything should have been fresh."}
{"text":"Finding good pizza in Charlotte that doesn't involve a long wait can be a challenge, especially on the weekend. We didn't have the patience to trek far just to wait, so decided to try this little joint not far from home. 

The pizza was definitely good - more of NY style with big slices you have to fold. We got the supreme and the ingredients tasted fresh and the crust was divine. I'll have to try the breadsticks next time. Speaking of next time, I think it will be for takeout or delivery (if they come this far). The décor/ambiance leaves a lot to be desired!

Their pizza didn't change my life, but it was solid and no wait to get a table!

Oh and I almost forgot to mention, they do have a small wine & beer selection. By small I mean mini wines!"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent.  Philly cheese steak is excellent.  Garlic knots are addictive.  Staff is incredibly friendly and makes you feel like you're dropping in for a family dinner.  We've taken visitors to Charlotte here for a quick slice, and inevitably they ask to go back on return trips to Charlotte.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I had the 10\" personal cheese pizza. I've never had a better one.  I grew up on New York pizzas, had pizzas in several American and Italian cities.  Fresh ingredients,  dough and sauces made daily. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This pizza one of the best in town. They made it by hands with unfrozen dough i can tell it because i use to be a pizzaoilo in San Diego in italian restaurant. If you hungry and want get something Italian this is definately the place you want to go. Also they prices are very reasonable and Dave (i guess the manager of this place) was very friendly and good man. I will come back to this place for sure thats why i reccomened this pizzeria to everyone !!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are good! Solid delivery time as well! Might try out the Gyro this time."}
{"text":"Great lunch option in Matthews for pizza or subs/ salads.  I've had the pizza which was very good. And, I've had hot subs a few times now and they were pretty good. There wasn't as much chicken on the chicken filet sandwich as I had hoped but it was a tasty sandwich.  Really nice owners. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery last night. It came within a reasonable timeframe. It was hot and delicious, with real crust (crispy/chewy). The service was great. I will order from them next time I need a good pizza! Oh! ...and they weren't stingy with toppings!

UPDATE: pizza is consistently delicious. Eclairs are mmmmm. Everything I've ordered has been fresh and fast and tasty! Niiiiccce!

AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF ORDERING FROM THEM: I keep waiting for a time when my pizza isn't superiorly delicious, or they are rude, or take too long or forget something... But they are consistent and SO nice, with the best quality delivery pizza in the area. PERIOD! 

BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Fun, divey, family oriented, cozy and you will have some for breakfast tomorrow! Great comfy food."}
{"text":"Ordered from the Eats app. Order showed up earlier than quoted by about 15 minutes which was a pleasant surprise since I was starving. Ordered a burger which came fully cooked (if you've ever ordered a burger for delivery you know that no matter what temp you specify the burger will come cooked fully) but was a decent burger. Also ordered the Philly cheesesteak pizza which was pretty good. The reason for 5 stars is because the delivery driver was probably one of the most pleasant individuals I have ever experienced on a pizza delivery. I will order from this place more often just because of this super nice guy."}
{"text":"delivery was prompt but pizza was way under-cooked, and pie contents had slided around.  pie was cut carelessly.  middle of pizza was almost too gooey to even go back in the oven."}
{"text":"Love this place, the best pizza I've ever had for sure ! Few employees but they are always very friendly. Can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this for pizza and italian (and philly cheese steaks) in Matthews. 

Their pizza is amazing and has an extra bit of something in it that I can't put my finger on, but it's special and they give you giant slices. The garlic knots are EVIL (in a good way).. buttery and garlic-y, get some extra napkins for these awesome rolls and get a mint if you are heading back to the office. :) 

The staff is super friendly. I feel like I'm visiting family when I go in there. If you've been here you know what I'm talking about. The son will pick on you and make friends, but also give great service, and the mom is a super sweet lady that is very nice to talk with. 

We've had a bit of everything and you always leave full, satisfied and happy. My friend  and my dad both said they had the best philly cheese steak in their lives here. 

You don't want to go here for white table dining since it's a tiny place on mint-hill rd, but if you are nearby and want a fantastic lunch or a casual dinner, you will be glad you did.

Also I'm 100% positive that the review from 'Lucas' below was meant for a different place. Nothing he described in his review matches this place and his review should be removed."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from here tonight. Hour and a half later it was delivered obviously cold, not to mention the taste wasn't that great. Not worth $26."}
{"text":"After seeing other reviews I was a litle apprehensive but I ordered a pizza anyway. Took 60 mins to arrive but compared to the other places in the area I've ordered from their pizza was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Primavera is not located in the greatest spot, as though this street gets plenty of traffic, most are simply trying to get from Independence to downtown Matthews, so this little brick center does not get much attention as they roar past. Too bad, as there are several businesses within that probably deserve a look (and this is only one).

Once inside, the owners are very friendly, treating you like family almost as soon as you start visiting. Be warned, as you may end up washing dishes. Only kidding, I think. They haven't had me wash yet. But they are happy to come out and talk to you about the food, showing the care that they put into each one.

The pie here is not NY style, so if that's what you are looking for, keep moving. Instead, you get a light, flaky crust, almost pastry-like. Worth eating all on its own, and not the kind that you can chow down on. This is a meal, especially the Primavera - the vegetables on that one are piled high. In fact, they are piled so high that it's one that you're going to have to eat it with utensils (or pick the veggies up from the plate).

If you want something a little lighter - but still far from light - try the white pizza or the lasagna pizza, which you can eat with your hands, but which will definitely leave you feeling full, so you can head across the road for some bowling when you are done."}
{"text":"My patty melt was on barely toasted bread, couldn't eat salad and dessert was obviously store bought and frozen when I got it. Not sure if I'd order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 10 inch pizzas and a Stromboli tonight to go. The pizzas looked pretty good however the taste was not so good. Basically I would describe them as wet pizzas where the bottom of the crust was wet and the toppings just slid off the top. Ingredients were average and while I had to reapply my Hawaiian topping multiple times back on the crust slice I can only give this 3 stars at best. There are better options around town"}
{"text":"Started coming after my dad bought pizza for quick
Dinner. I was so taken aback at how good the crust was ! The whole pizza was delicious actually... perfect meaty cheese, not stingy with the toppings at allllll & did I mention the crust already ??? Honestly sooo good! The guy making the pizza is so nice and friendly and makes you glad you shopped at a small business instead of a large chain pizza shop. They are reasonably priced , have great lunch specials & def don't forget the love when making your good. I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the Egg plant Parmesan for lunch and it was awesome! A HUGE helping, should have ordered the kids size! The only thing I didn't like was that they only had the thick pasta, (I'm an angel hair kind of person). The garlic knots were delicious!"}
{"text":"I visited the other night, 8pm.  Wanted to wait for the pizza, I really like this pizza, the cheese, the toppings, and all are quite good.  Got the supreme like we usually do, It was perfect.

Also ordered the philly beef calzone, very good.

I like to dough that is used, I wish I had a hot oven to cook it.

Recommend this place, staff and family there!"}
{"text":"Nice little ma and pop place. Had pizza and wings. The wings were just ok but the pizza was pretty good. Good service, nice people we would go back."}
{"text":"First and last time I will use this place. If I could give them less than 1 star, I would. Yesterday I ordered the fried zucchini, French fries and a Philly cheese steak pizza from them. Everything arrived nearly burnt and super soggy. On top of that I hot food poisoning from their food. When I called back today to speak to a manager and got the worst customer service ever. They got snide with me and said it couldn't have been their food. It was the ONLY thing I had eaten all day so, YES, it was thwir food. I got no resolution, got called a liar and hung up on. NEVER again. Stay away from this place! I will be notifying the health department about getting sick as well."}
{"text":"Got a large pepperoni & extra cheese pie, the crust was good toward the outside but way too thin toward the middle.  The sauce is too watery and water logs the crust because its too thin.   All the toppings and sauce slid to the middle of the pie during the ride home in the car and was a soupy mess at home.  This is definitely fork pizza.  Also the sauce needs more tomato paste and salt.   The employees were friendly, that was a plus!"}
{"text":"This pizza place opened up 6 days ago & there are many options for pizza in downtown which we have tried them all . I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the pizza & wings . Price is exceptional , delivery was prompt & friendly . Will definitely be ordering from this business in the future"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. New York style with a nice selection of speciality pizzas. The lasagna pizza was awesome. The crust is nice and light with garlic and butter. Delicious."}
{"text":"The food was really good! I had a Philly cheesesteak and a Gyro (lunch special). It was seasoned well and big portions. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've ever eaten!! Garlic Knots are croissant-like in their flakiness. Her garlic sauce is homemade and amazing!! I will definitely be eating here on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Where do I start? 
The soda machine must have been broken because it did not dispense soda, but rather some kind of caustic liquid.
I ordered a simple plate of French fries but was treated to a plate of grease soaked potato things.
My wife ordered the club sub which was poor. 
My daughter in law got the pizza which was marginal at best.
My son had a Philly sub which led to some kind of gastric exorcism later that night.
The food was just terrible, but the attitude of the staff is what really took the cake.
They seemed to not care about anything we brought to their attention. This apathetic stance if what we seemed to notice the most.  Just a poor excuse of how employees should act.
I would avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"So I was out at the Carolina Beer Temple, and my friend and I got a craving for pizza.  We broke out our smart phones and we decided to give Primavera Pizza a try.  I had always seen it from the road but never had an excuse to stop in.  Man, I didn't know what I was missing!!

At first glance, the place doesn't really wow you with a great location or fancy decor, but what really shines is the food.  We were looking for pizza by the slice and we were definitely surprised.  I am so used to places just having the normal cheese and pepperoni ready to heat up, but this place has cheeses waiting and then you can customize it with toppings for and extra 0.25 a topping.  And they DO NOT skimp on the toppings either.  I had two slices of bacon sausage pizza and there was bacon and sausage all over it - you could barely see the cheese.  The crust was definitely unique and buttery.. I even ate the end crust too, usually it is just the vessel that delivers the  cheesy goodness into my stomach, but here it definitely adds to it.

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and took a table.  Very casual here, the guy got us drinks and then took our order.  It looks like this place handles a lot of take out since a lot of people were in and out while we were eating.  I only got to experience the place once, but it looks like you can order at the counter and then take a seat as well, there is no real formality to it all, just lets the food speak for itself which is great.

Totally family business... mom and dad in the back cooking it felt like while the son was delivering pizzas and taking orders.  I will definitely try to come back to try their hot subs or other Italian offerings."}
{"text":"Wow. Probably the best Pizza in Las Vegas! I was worried with the mixed reviews, but this is my first time ordering. I hope they keep it going."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots.  Actually we usually grab a beer at beer temple and this place delivers there.  It's the best italian food we have found in the area. Their pizza is amazing, but their calzones...  ohhhh, my mouth waters just thinking about it. Something about the homemade sauce. It's the best!!!!!   Awesome family owned establishment. Great people."}
