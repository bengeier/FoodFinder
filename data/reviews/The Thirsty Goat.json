{"text":"Very unwelcoming place. Stopped after work and we were confronted by a waitress asking what we were doing there?  Huh?  Walking to the bar to have a drink. We should have walked out."}
{"text":"You have to try this place!!! Great food, great service and great new look!  You will not leave hungry with the sampler meal!   I will be back for more soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to watch this new restaurant come to my neighborhood. After two visits I'm less than impressed. The food was edible but not memorable. Some staff were cheerful and helpful and a few were shockingly rude. I hope they work out the bumps, secure a few high quality suppliers and turn up the charm."}
{"text":"I've had burgers twice from Thirsty Goat, and they've rivaled Dotty Dumpling's Dowry. And their homemade chips are excellent. My husband was happy to find a great fish fry as well. The ambiance is nothing remarkable, but the waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. This is a great addition to Fitchburg dining options."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Incompetent rude indifferent service. Worst waiter ever.   Let me start by saying my family is always very respectful to wait staff, we always say please and thank you and help clean up our plates at the end of the meal.   Our first time, and probably last time, at Thirsty Goat with my family of 4 at 1140am(not lunch rush) on a Saturday.   After being seated and waiting an additional 10 minutes or so for waiter to show up, we ordered our drinks and luckily our food at the same time. It took a total of 25 minutes for our drinks to show up ONE at a time. I noted that our waiter spent a lot of time talking to the 2 bartenders. At this point my husband went up to the bar and patiently told them that it had taken along time just for drinks and that we hoped it wasn't going to take an excessive amount of time for our meal, that we need to be somewhere at 1pm. I had ordered water with lemon, in addition to my other drink, and that never came so I went up to the bar and nicely requested a glass of water, the bartender asked \"Where are your seated?\" \"Who is your waiter?\" I told her it was a man and that it had taken 25minutes to get my drink so I decide to get my own water.  Then the other bartender Rudely stated that my drink had been ordered incorrectly by the waiter and she had to remake it (which still shouldn't have taken 25min) and we had ordered broasted chicken that took 20 minutes to cook (which should be noted on the menu or at least told to the customer ).  I calmly asked her to send the manager to our table.  Our food finally arrived and it was good, which is unfortunate because I doubt many people will return if they continue with this kind of service, I highly doubt we will.  When the manager arrived she seemed slightly put out, hesitant, and uncertain of how to react and handle the recount of our experience. She eventually told us that she would remove the cost of our drinks from the bill and offered free dessert which we turned down.  Just an overall uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"What makes a good beef brisket? It should be moist, falling-apart tender, and deliciously beefy with a subtle smoke. That's what I got here. The handcut fries with skins were great. The mac and cheese was tasty. With four fun sauces to try, everyone at the table can choose a favorite.  I make a point of trying all the BBQ joints in town, and I thought this place was one of the best, because all the elements of the meal appeared to be fresh, made in-house and of good quality."}
{"text":"First time here, good food. Good beer selection, staff was friendly. It was a little noisy, but we managed."}
{"text":"Could be, should be such a great place. Started out that way when it opened. I have had very pleasant experiences here but recently the bar staff is very inattentive and are more interested in things other than providing good service to customers. Too bad because I want this nice new bar & restaurant to succeed. Food is very good but...SERVICE MUST BE GOOD or it will fade just like most of the rest. Owner, take this to heart. I know!"}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad food. Bad prices.  We went with a group of six. Service was slow. Nacho appetizer was good put didn't have very many chips. Sampler platter was an expensive pile of fat. Brisket was inedible due to all the fat you had to cut off, ribs were small and not very exciting. Pulled pork was greasy and fatty too. Sides came in small plastic cups and were lukewarm at best. Pub chips were cold and stale. Corn bread was cold and dry. Beers took forever to get - not worth $5 each.  Such simple things they had to get right but couldn't. Disappointing to spend $60 for two of us and walk away hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"The first strike against the place was seating a young couple in an area filled with young children- some of them running around the dining area. I guess we should have asked to be seated near the bar.   My boyfriend ordered one of the brisket which he thought was fine. I ordered the smoked sausage - which was one of the most unappetizing sausages I have ever seen. In addition, the mac and cheese was so bland and dry I wasn't convinced that cheese was even an ingredient. Then at the end they brought us the wrong check. We aren't planning to return.   As another group was leaving, though, I overhead one of them saying that she loved the sandwich that she ordered - so maybe others will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, had the pulled pork sandwich and it was very good. The homemade chips could have been fresher."}
{"text":"Just finished up our visit to The Thirsty Goat and won't be rushing to get back.  While the food was fine, and really it was  just fine, the service was awful.  The hostess did not say one word to us when we walked in, no welcome, just led us to our table and didn't offer us menus.  I had to go back to the hostess desk to get menus, which she seemed annoyed by and still said not one word. Honestly, she seemed totally spaced out.  The waitresses couldn't decide which one of them should be taking care of our table, so initially we had two of them and then they both disappeared. The guy who brought us our appetizers didn't offer us plates, until I caught him on his way back around and he said, \"Oh yeah, I guess I should have gotten you plates.\"  Never saw the waitress again, waited and waited for a check, as did the table next to us. Ugh.  This place could be a great addition to the area, but unless someone tells me the service picks up, I'll pass."}
{"text":"We thought it would be fun to try their food on opening day, we went in with relatively low expectations but a positive attitude mainly because open day always has kinks. It guess it was wise of us to have low expectations because we waited a long time for our server to show up and she never came back to check on us once our food was delivered. The Nitro Mud Puppy Porter was flat and sadly our brisket nachos were disappointing. The nachos must have sat under a heat lamp for 20 minutes longer than they should have. Some of the brisket was like beef jerky and the cheese and chips were so baked on to the plate that it wasn't appetizing and the chips were either chewy or burnt from sitting so long under the heat lamp. Also, the serving size was quite small for the price of the nachos. Since it was opening day and we expected that it may not be the best experience, we will give this restaurant another chance (just not the nachos) but probably not for awhile."}
{"text":"Just happened to be walking distance from our overnight hotel.  Huge outdoor patio overlooking a pond.  We were welcome with our pooches!  Very good service.   Tried Magners pear cider!  Yum!  And had pulled pork.  And baby back ribs!  Both entrees were excellent along w great cornbread.    Live music too was very good.  If we pass thru here again, we d definitely go back."}
{"text":"The renovations to this place are great, and it's a much more welcoming feel than before. We looked around a bit before being seated, and there are two different bar areas, one in the center of the room, another off on the other side of the building. Good beer selection. I had the pulled pork, and my companion ordered a chicken Caesar salad- both were very good. It was very loud last night, and our server didn't hear the \"chicken\" part, so it was initially delivered without chicken. She went to great effort to make it right very quickly, and provided awesome service all around. The pulled pork was quite good, and there are three types of sauces available- regular, sweet and tangy and chipotle.   In all, a great experience, and we look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Food took forever to come; orders were wrong; orders were missing and most of the cornbread was burnt. Lastly, in general the food was tasteless and cold by the time we received it. The only thing that was good was the green beans and mushrooms.  Oh, I forgot.... one of the alcoholic drinks had paper in it.   The waitress seemed very nervous to work with us that made us a little uncomfortable.  I am giving it 2 stars because one of the bartenders was extremely nice.  Not a restaurant that I would send my money at again."}
{"text":"The brisket and the ribs are tops! Plenty of seating, and back room that could probably be used for events. They could really improve on spicing up that mac and cheese though. I was sad about that.   We enjoyed drinks on the patio around the firepit after our meal. Staff were attentive and friendly! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the 4 pc broasted chicken for $12.99. Comes with two sides - I chose Spicy Corn and fries - and cornbread... or so I thought. I didn't get any cornbread, instead stole half from a co-worker.  In a previous Yelper's photo, I saw there was some shredded cheese sprinkled on the cornbread. When I called to place the to-go order, I asked them to not include cheese on the cornbread, to which I was told they no longer are doing that.  The cornbread is moist yet crumbly, light honey flavor and baked golden brown. It's up there with the dangerously caloric Famous Dave's and Liliana's versions.  My broasted chicken was one large breast, two smaller wings, and a leg. All except for the leg were white meat. The menu specifically states it's a combination. The skin was fried crisp, the meat tender and flavorful. I was skeptical, but the predominant smokehouse menu know it's stuff.  The fries were skin-on potato, trumping the average run-of-the-mill steak fries at most establishments. The spicy corn is indeed spicy, not for your average mid-westerners' palate. I'd rate that a level 3 out of 5.  The group order came with their own Styrofoam container of sauces; House, Sweet & Saucy, Chipotle, and Bourbon. My favorite was the Chipotle, smokey and sassy!  Clearly they have some kinks that need working out. Do not fret, the food will be a saving grace methinks. I would like to go back and see what they've done with the place since it was Casa del Sol and try their brew."}
{"text":"After 3 visits for lunch, I can say that the food is good and comes out quickly. The service is solid.  Even when I was part of a large group, they got everything right."}
{"text":"Terrible food, was really hoping for something good, new and fresh in the neighborhood. Chicken sandwich taste like Sysco foods product. French fries soggy. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Overall I'm happy with the food but this is the second time I've been in and there is been no one to greet me. The service staff didn't know whether or not there were tables available. When I did get seated it was a secondhand. Thought and seated in the back and-the waiter was terrible all the wood we tipped him very well.  I asked for a 12 ounce steak which came out under cooked but I like my meat rare so it was OK. The brisket is middle of the road to average but it is consistent. And it's really hard to screw up pulled pork. The only real drawback is that there are not good drinks to order from the menu.  It has the Wisconsin standard ledger of crappy beers and overall the place is pretty cheap.  Upon second review and visit on April 9th The cornbread was cold The big potato was undercooked and the brisket was half fat and for some reason a place that has 80,000 drinks doesn't have a bottled water ... weird...for these reasons I am reducing my previous 3 star rating to a one star"}
{"text":"Prime Brisket was very good and my wife had brosted chicken she said was very good. Nice place good food and drink."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking out the Thirsty Goat, seeing the  reviews and was disappointed. It wasn't very busy, ordered the prime rib special sandwich and it seemed to be past it's prime , old and chewy! Asked for Ketchup it never came and no refills on soda. I don't need to came back."}
{"text":"We came for the food but stayed for the... bill. It was a disappointing experience overall. First, you could tell that the waiters, as nice as they were, understood the food was mediocre. Though I was surprised to see there were no goat-based products, I ordered the brisket, my wife the ribs, and my sister the pulled pork. The brisket and pork was extremely greasy, read: a pool of grease on the plate, though the ribs were ok. The macaroni and cheese tasted like powdered cheese, which is an abomination in these parts. The baked beans had so much seasoning that they were almost inedible. Sometimes a long wait is worth it on a Saturday around lunch, but not here. If you're looking for good food at a fair price, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for barbecue, I recommend trying Smoky Jon's in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been to the Thirsty Goat several times now and can't say I have ever walked away completely satisfied.  The food is good, not amazing, and they don't seem to have lunch specials which make for a pricey lunch.  The last time we were in and there just seemed to be a weird smell in the air.  Reminded me of a hospital, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Service has always been good and food usually comes out in a timely manner.  Their smoked meats are not my favorite but I do love their chili!"}
{"text":"This was kind of a bummer visit from start to finish.  While nothing was overtly bad, there were enough not good moments to be pretty disappointing.  From a service standpoint, there is nothing more bothersome to me than arriving at a restaurant, standing at the \"please wait to be seated sign\" for five minutes while you make eye contact with multiple employees from across the room, and still don't get acknowledged. Luckily, a member of my party had already arrived and texted directions to the table. Our server was friendly, but very busy and service was slow in general. One of our party's orders was completely forgotten and the person that delivered our food employed a strategy of asking if we needed anything as his back was half turned and he was walking away from the table.   I ordered the sampler platter to try the barbecue, and was happy with the sausage though frankly that was something I could have purchased and made myself. The brisket was dry, somewhat difficult to cut into manageable pieces and had a very heavy smoke flavor that felt manufactured or really, really heavy.  I ordered coleslaw as a side which was pretty bland, and kettle chips which were actually my second favorite part of the meal. Good beer list - easy to find something no matter your preference. There are much better barbecue places around, though, and from a service  standpoint I'd like to see this place work on their teamwork a bit more."}
{"text":"Considering the place was really busy, I would say they did a great job seating and servicing us. The interior is much better and they even have 2 bars to accommodate people. We had been to Casa de Sol only once due to the service, but would definitely come back to 'Thirsty Goat' again!!"}
{"text":"Lots of good tap beers and good brisket tacos and chili. Comfort food while watching the game. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at some of the low star ratings on here cause during Thanksgiving week my family and I ended up going there THREE times!   They loved the nachos, and I love all the sandwiches on the smokehouse menu. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing wings!!! Great beer selection!!! You have a better chance of winning the powerball than meeting a girl though!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Tempting to go one star, except the pulled pork sandwich was fair. What I don't get, is how do you mess up Kraft Mac and cheese?  Were in Wisconsin. Cheese is right in the name. And you mess it up? Criminal.   Instead of using butter or margarine in the Mac and cheese, they used vegetable oil? Macaroni. Cheese. I've made my share of Kraft. Butter, Margarine and milk to their macaroni and \"cheese.\"  Nope, we struck oil. FTL."}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the BBQ is pretty darn good.  They have a great selection of beers and the atmosphere is awesome.  Been there twice and planning on going back every time to visit"}
{"text":"This place is always busy so my wife and I decided to try it and see what the hype was about. We came here on a Sunday during their brunch. The menu is smaller than their normal menu. The interior is a nice brew pub look and casual. Service was average. The table we sat at had some sticky spots but when we pointed it out, the server cleaned it up right away.  I ordered the Brisket Eggs Benedict with homemade hollandaise sauce. Looking at the menu(s), they have a brew pug type menu with burgers, steaks, and BBQ (Brisket). I love eggs benedict so this was a natural choice. My wife had the breakfast burrito topped with brisket chili.  I was disappointed when I cut into my poached egg to find it was overcooked - cardinal sin of serving eggs benedict. The brisket was also tough. It was served with breakfast potatoes and a side of fresh fruit. I did enjoy the fruit since most places this usually consists of melon. The fruit was fresh strawberries, pineapple, and bananas.  My wife's burrito was better than my eggs. The burrito was tasty but the key was the brisket chili. That really made the dish stand out.  Also, $5 Bellini weren't too bad during brunch! Overall, this place has a lot of potential and I would like to return to try the loaded waffle or for their regular menu. It is definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"1st visit to thirsty goat, will not be back.  I have about 5 years experience as a waiter so I'm pretty lenient however this was just bad.  Took approximately 40 minutes for food with no explanation as to why it was late. Told it's on the line ready to come out and finally 10-13 minutes later it did.  Other big tables that came in one 5 minutes another 10 minutes after us received food their food before us.  My boneless wings were wrong and dried out as if they sat under heat lamps for 20 minutes. More proof for this is my daughters Mac and cheese was in a bowl on a plate and the plat was very hot when it came out. It obviously wouldn't normally be this way unless it sat under heat lamps. Other parties cheese fries look gross due to cheese having sat under lamp, to which he didn't eat them.  Honestly I would have given a three star review probably if our waitress or someone explained what the issue was. I can't stand when you flat out lie when obviously either the waitress forgot to put something in or the kitchen made a mistake. Just tell me, don't leave a table of 8 with 2 kids sitting here for 40 minutes after you put in the order.  Bottom line, tons of different options to pick in this area and all around Madison. Multiple people dropped the ball tonight and for that I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would give it a negative, if possible. Music too loud for 12:30 PM. The waitress kept turning it down , and the bartender kept turning it back up. Only one old guy was at the bar, so it seemed he was more important than the restaurant guests. Food was average. Our order was wrong. I felt sorry for the stressed out waitress. Would never go back. Told friends about it, and they said they had similar experience a year ago. Didn't go back either."}
{"text":"Our group of six tried the Thirsty Goat for dinner and drinks last night. The space is deceptive. It is much larger than it appears from outside. We were met at the door by the hostess who led us to our table. Everything was clean, modern, and bright.  Our waitress arrived with menus and took our drink order. They have a large number of beers on tap and I was able to try a couple I had never had before such as the 5 Lizard Witbier and the Magners Pear Irish Cider. The real star was the food. Our dishes included the nachos with smoked brisket, the premium baby back ribs, the sausage platter and the grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. We also tried many of the sides including the chips, cornbread, cole slaw, mac & cheese, and fresh-cut fries. There was not a disappointed diner among us. All of the meats were smokey, juicy and delicious. They offer four table-side barbecue sauces to complement the meats. My favorites were the house and the sweet and tangy. The portions were large and we even had left-overs.   Our waitress returned multiple times to check on us and replenish our beverages. This was a great evening with friends and the food, drink, and ambiance just enhanced the experience. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for the first time and was hesitant because of the reviews but I'm glad we went!! I think people are being a little hard, I mean no I wouldn't say it's the best BBQ meat I've had but this is WI. And someone could argue that it doesn't matter but it does I don't think I've ever had smoked meat around here that compares to your Texas brisket or Tennessee. That being said I had the brisket platter and it was still awesome, I got the mashed potatoes which hit the spot and my boyfriend got the burger and fries which were equally as awesome. You get aloooooot of food too which is always a plus. Service was fast and friendly and the Moscow mule was good and strong! Definitely will go back sometime!"}
{"text":"This place was near our hotel and looked like it had a great patio, so we decided to stop in for a small lunch. Patio was nice indeed!  We came around 1PM on a Saturday to a pretty empty restaurant. Service was decent - waitress was very friendly, but there were times when we were waiting for her to come back.  Food was pretty good. We got chicken wings in the sweet and tangy sauce and an order of the cheese curds. The chicken wings were BIG and probably the most meaty chicken wings I have ever had. The sauce itself was pretty meh, but the meatiness of the wings made up for it. Cheese curds were pretty unique in that they were crunchy on the outside and very soft inside - not sure what cheese they used, but it was definitely not the usual white cheese curd. They were yellow (like cheddar?) on the inside. Very tasty! But also pretty greasy, so proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Got the Sampler Platter with Sausage, Beef brisket and ribs. Comes with two sides. Also tried they're Sea Dog Wild Blueberry Beer. Was very tasty."}
{"text":"The Thirsty Goat is a fantastic bar and grill! I had the bacon and egg burger and it was cooked exactly how I asked it to be. The homemade chips were also good. To top this it off the service was top notch and they had live music."}
{"text":"We were seated on a slow Sunday evening (tables were less than 40% full) and sat.... and sat.... and sat....   I can be very patient if we are acknowledged and you put a cup of coffee or a beer in front of me, but ignore us and we leave.  And we did!   After waiting more than fifteen minutes without so much as a \"I'll be with you soon\", we went to Me & Julio's down the street where we had service within 30 seconds.    Shape up, Thirsty Goat!"}
{"text":"great beer selection, really good smoked bbq, great porch (good for kids). One of my favorite local joints."}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and pulled pork. I love having the BBQ sauce options as well. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I really need to learn to trust reviews more. I really wanted to think the service and food would be decent as I came in at 4:00 pm and there were only a few patrons in the establishment. In hindsight... if it's approaching dinner time on a Saturday and the parking lot is empty, maybe that's a sign.   The side salad had great items in it but was about 1/3 of the size of what you would anticipate. I got a side of \"seasonable vegetables\" which consisted of green beans absolutely soaked in oil with over cooked mushrooms.   For a meal I got a chicken sandwich and fries. The sandwich was decent, the fries came out cold and soggy.   To top it all off, the ambiance was terrible. They had high school softball on the tv and I sat for over 30 minutes listening to staff complain to one another. One gentleman with some shaggy hair and a hat on sat at the bar with a fellow employee - they both must have gotten off of work and were eating and drinking as their heart desired. The comments coming out of his mouth - while clearly representing his workplace - were woefully inadequate of anything professional. Between the curse words to the phone calls he was making on speakerphone... it was evident that he was quite intoxicated.   Staff continued to complain to one another about a changing menu, their work schedules, and other customers. I was quick to leave after checking out."}
{"text":"The pulled pork and chicken are so good.  So many good beers on tap as well. Great patio to sit on when it's nice out. Tons of tvs to watch your favorite team. One of my go to's"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to the Fitchburg area and had to try this place. Our first try was the same as all our other times stopping here, exceptional.   Every server and bartender we have had are super friendly, chatty, and helpful.   Food is delicious. Their BBQ is quality with homemade BBQ sauces. My favorite is the brisket. I put it on a Caesar salad.  My only complaint is they got rid of the burnt ends!!! Those were the perfect appetizer!   Being a beer advocate, their selection is good with a nice rotation. They aren't afraid to give out samples which helps in choosing.   Atmosphere is lovely and lots of tvs to watch your favorite sports game!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything is awesome I love it brisket pulled pork smoked chicken broasted chicken brisket chili awesome I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family and don't forget the neighbors"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Brisket tacos, chicken fingers, and spinach artichoke dip were all great. Music was proper level to enjoy and still talk. Great experience. Awesome beer too!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice now, and so far so good!! I went in for a beer just to check the place out. Good service, great selection of beer. I was excited to come in and get food and further see how the restaurant does.  Second time, my boyfriend and I went in after I had an eye appointment so that does effect my review. Haha. I couldn't see pretty much anything, but our host was great, and our server was also great. Timely, had very good menu knowledge, and was very hospitable. I have some severe food allergies and she made me feel very safe ordering and eating there. The mac and cheese was awesome!! Creamy and rich with a little kick to keep it from getting to be too much. The breasted chicken was also fantastic, crispy on the outside, moist and delicious on the inside.  Overall delicious food, great service, and we definitely will be back. Prices seemed a little high for apps but I also didn't get to try any of them so I can't accurately review that. Would definitely recommend and we will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was ok.  The meat had no flavor and was a bit on the dry side which seemed to follow a theme with the rest of the food.  Among the blandest of them all was the mac and \"cheese.\"  I LOVE mac and cheese and this was an abomination.  At glance it looked like white cheddar and at first taste was more noodle than any other flavor.  We ended up dousing most of the food with barbecue sauce to give it some zing.  On a high note, the corn bread was delicious and could stand alone."}
{"text":"Was back for lunch, and had the fried chicken, it was excellent. Service was decent, but I felt that the waitress would wait until the glass was all the way empty to come by and ask if we needed another. But the food was very good. The only other thing I would have done is had some wet-naps on the table, with all your specialty BBQ sauces I think that would help."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks with some friends great atmosphere great service wonderful selection of craft beers. Love the patio with the gas fire pit on the man made pond"}
{"text":"Great burgers and drinks! I really enjoy that it is close to my home. Great place to drop in and watch the Badgers or Packers play!"}
{"text":"the food was very good but seems like they have an identity crisis. pricing on the appetizers over priced compared to the regular menu. Not a place to come for happy hour with the co-workers. I would call it a high end bar b que joint. My biggest complaint was the sauces on the table are poorly labeled. had to taste them just to find out what they were. Service was subpar. Train your staff to ask if it is your first time and explain the menu and sauce options.  $4.00 for a 16oz. tap PBR??? little out of line as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite BBQ in the city, you can't find any better. The staff is always friendly and the desserts are delicious too."}
{"text":"We've been there 3 times. Never disappointing. Good tap beer selection. The smokehouse food is top notch!"}
{"text":"If food is all you seek then this place is great.     Now, if you are looking for food and service I would say you've gone to the wrong place.  Again I love the food unfortunately I've left unhappy three different times now.   The last time I was trying to get another beer but a manager wasn't paying attention and I waited nearly 10 minutes for a beer.     After finally paying I left to find my bartender outside sitting on the side of the building having a cigarette.  No problem, but at least have someone looking after the patrons.    Needless to say I will try not to go back."}
{"text":"We went to a surprise engagement party at the Thirsty Goat. Very good food, good service and pretty view. Definitely going back for the meatballs."}
{"text":"Food was interesting and service was less than desired. Waiter never came back after food was received and waited forever for the bill."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. It's a great little bar. I'm working my way down the menu and have not been disappointed yet. The setting is casual and fun. I would highly recommend this restaurant for the food, drink, and staff. I'm not from here and they have made it feel like home."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. It's close to my house, it has a great beer selection that's not gross Great Dane beer, and it's a frickin bbq joint. My god, all they have to do is not suck and care about their food and I'd be a regular. Unfortunately this endeavor will probably go the way of other restaurants in the location.   We went for a friend's bday on a Sunday night. Atmosphere is kinda sports barish, with tons of TVs.  They've got a ton of craft beers on tap, which any bar these days probably should if they want to compete. The menu consisted of mostly BBQ items: wing's, ribs, BBQ sandwiches, brisket etc. I was stoked to get my meat sweats on.  I was told the smoked wings were as good as Liliana's down the road, so I had to try them.  The wings themselves were pretty good, big and smokey.  But the buffalo sauce was served on the side in a little cup. The sauce itself was completely separated as if it had sat on the back of the fridge for weeks. It didn't look edible.  It was pretty gross. The sauce was served without the lid, so the server knew she was giving me possibly spoiled, gross looking old separated sauce. Also, who serves buffalo wings with the sauce on the side? To quote Bill Burr, \"I gave you 100% of the $ to prepare 100% of the meal!\"   The wings weren't the most disappointing part of the meal. It was the entrees. After consulting the server about the differences between the St Louis style and Baby Back ribs, I chose the St Louis style because she said they had more meat. Now I love ribs. They are a staple of any BBQ joint. I smoke/ grill my own and they are surprisingly easy to make.  These ribs were probably the worst I've ever had. This is not hyperbole. They were terrible. I thought it was a joke when the half rack came out and was a little bigger than a deck if cards- $15 lol. There was no meat on half of the rack. Like none. And as for the little meat that was there, it was beyond burnt and disgustingly dry. It was a seriously a joke. As a BBQ spot, how do you screw up self proclaimed \"premium ribs?\" I actually lost sleep  trying to Setapp my brain around how bad they were. It was almost insulting.  As for other entrees, my wife's brisket was room temp. My dad liked his soup, but he also cooks himself ketchup, noodles and unseasoned ground beef...  Oh and the \"corn bread.\" Lol. People not from the Midwest laugh at our interpretations of corn bread. This would be a great \"Exhibit A\" in the museum of failed impressions of corn bread.  You should try it just to see for yourself. Sad but funny.  This isn't one of those \"If I could give less than one star I would!\" reviews. TG earned that 1 star with their beer  selection. I'm sure once it warms up, it'll be a nice spot to grab a beer on the patio, then head somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I did not know this was a barbecue place and intended only to have appetizers and drinks, at the time.  We walked through the front door and were hit with the intense smell of smoke.  I could barely contain my excitement as heading to the bar.    While the exterior of the building looks similar to it's previous establishment apart from the paint color, the interior is almost completely unrecognizable from Casa Del Sol.  This is a welcome change.  After taking a seat, we were instantly welcomed by the bartender.  There is a somewhat surprising selection of beers and a large number of TVs, so you can catch your favorite game.  We ordered the cheese curds and the Smoked Sliders.  The cheese curds were crispy, light and gooey all at the same time.  The house-made ranch was thin, which I prefer when it comes to curds.  The sliders came in brisket, pulled pork, and chicken, which we shared.  All were delicious, having their own distinct flavor, and all the meats were surprisingly moist.  If I had to choose a favorite, it would have been the pulled pork.  On the bar, there were four sauces to choose from, varying in flavor and thickness.  From my limited experience, I would say that this place has some of the better tasting bbq in the Madison-area.  I'll have to go back to try burgers or other items from the smokehouse.  If so much attention goes to a couple of appetizers, I am sure the other menu items are executed equally as well.  The staff were incredibly friendly and courteous.  Prices were a bit on the high side, but that can be expected from a barbecue place.  Based on this experience, they have earned my repeat business the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the place is nice! The corn bread is amazing! If you go on Sundays the menu is \"limited\"."}
{"text":"My dad loves Thirsty Goat. It's his new favorite spot, so when we visited for the holidays he had to show us. Their brisket sandwich is really really flavorful and juicy. My aunt had to cut her sandwich with a knife and eat with a fork, but she loved it!  My mom enjoyed her Caesar salad, and the fries are hand cut and cooked to order. They have multiple different BBQ and hot sauces at each table to choose from. Our waiter was excellent, probably the most polite service I've ever had. The interior is classy and completely different from the old Casa de Lara restaurant that used to live here.   A solid spot for brisket, and good fries, with a classier than average atmosphere for a casual meal.   Dad found a good one."}
{"text":"We ate here with another couple on a Saturday night.  It was great that they take reservations as the place was soon packed.  And loud.  Very.  The menu seemed pretty limited. The sandwiches ordered -- a fancy hamburger and a blacked chicken special -- looked and tasted great.  The chicken wings were average.  And the fish tacos were disappointing -- tortillas seemed old, slaw was dry and plain, meager sauce.  The service was fine, however. Our feeling was that it is more of a bar than restaurant and that we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times already and love it. Oddly enough we have had the same waiter, Skylar, every time and he has always been fun, attentive and quick.  We have yet to try something on the menu that isn't good. The brisket chili is perfect for a fall day, the ribs are amazing. The burgers are delicious as well.   The atmosphere is inviting and really a place you would want to hang out on game day. Tons of tvs, warm decor, but not too loud. Also, their beer selection is no joke. Can't wait until they start brewing their own!"}
{"text":"First time visitors. Friday night fish fry. Lake perch was really good. Unusually light batter on the fish which was appreciated. Portion OK - bordering on skimpy. Chef needs to try a new cole slaw concept. Bland, overly creamy - tossed. Fries were total mush. Great service and good vibes in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to have a business meeting there with other business consultants.  The interior was nicely laid out and clean.  I ordered a burger without the bun - the hamburger meat seemed either old or a poor grade of meat.  I only ate a couple of bites covered with bbq sauce to mask the smell/taste.  We all received separate checks and I noticed a \"service charge\" on my receipt.  I didn't leave a tip since TG decided how much they wanted for a tip.  May try it again in another year to see if things have changed."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night planning for it to be busy, new restaurants are a big deal in the suburbs! Busy was an understatement. Waited 40 minutes to be seated, about 10 min for beers, and around 30 for our food. That being said, they do still have a \"now hiring\" sign up so we can't judge too much.  The beer selection was decent and included many local brews which was nice. We got the nacho appetizer Nd loved it! We then split a sampler of brisket, ribs, and chicken. The ribs were absolutely PHENOMINAL. Never in my life have I not wanted to coat meat in sauce, they were that good! Brisket was juicy and fell apart in your mouth. Chicken was just ok  The 4 different sauces were fun and tasty, and fries and cornbread were excellent! We will be back on a less busy night!"}
{"text":"As it was opening lunch, things were a bit bumpy when I sat down at the bar-bartender not able to find beer list, not able to find the tap but that can be expected on day 1 of a new venture.  They did a nice job cozying up the interior of the former Casa de Sol by placing wood paneling throughout the restaurant.  They have two bar areas at the restaurant which may prove problematic long term.   The menu has a few appetizers, salads, sandwiches as well as a few entrees centered around their smoked meats.  As the lunch menu is shared with dinner service, there are some dishes I would not consider either from a size or a cost perspective.  For instance, their sampler platter (brisket, chicken, and ribs) clocks in at $22.99.  Instead, I opted for the brisket sandwich.  The food arrived quick.  The brisket was smoked well and had the right amount of fat to ensure a juicy sandwich.  The brioche it came on was also tasty and made a solid meal.  The chips were rather on the stale side and the coleslaw was your standard fare.  The meat is served \"naked\" but they do bring out a side of bbq sauce if that is your thing.  I tried in both ways and thought the sauce did a nice job complementing the beef. Thirsty Goat as 30 taps on hand and they do a nice job with selecting both standard as well as a few ones that you don't see much in the area. Over time, I am sure the waitstaff will get things smoothed out and look forward to coming back and trying something else. One thing I do wonder is this is a big space and with a big space comes lofty sales goals to offset the property costs.  Only time will tell."}
{"text":"Brisket was good not great. Service was SLOW.   Don't try to go over lunch unless you have a lot of time. We thought our server forgot about us twice, but none of the other tables were getting service either.   Cornbread was fantastic."}
{"text":"Ordered the Beef Brisket and half of it came back as a pile of Fat...would have gotten a better mark if it wasn't for that.  Spicy corn and baked beans were good.   Disappointing..."}
{"text":"This could be a great restaurant.  Their meats are spectacular, especially the brisket which is made with Prime, not Choice.  We were a group of 5 on a Sunday night, and as expected the place was not crowded, so we were seated immediately.  They have a great selection of craft beers, so I see why \"thirsty\" is in the name.  I had the Oregon 10-barrel, though the server wasn't sure if they had any left and he disappeared for quite a while before the beer arrived.  Everyone was quite happy with their meals: ribs, chicken, pulled pork, and I had the brisket platter.  The meat is quite simply the best brisket I have had in a restaurant.  I make my own on  a water smoker, but it must be the Prime beef because the marbling was phenomenal, the meat was tender and juicy.  The sides were just \"ok\": the beans were watery, and the slaw was over-sauced.  I just didn't feel like our waiter made us feel welcome.  He took our order without any issues and came by for a drink refill, but he just didn't seem very friendly.  Lots of big screen TV's everywhere, which was great as the Badgers were losing to Northwestern.  This is one of those places when you walk out you just feel like the owners are missing a great opportunity.  They really have great BBQ, and if they bring their sides and service up to the same level this place could be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is ok and service is what you would expect from a brew pub.  What really got my goat, so to speak, is that I met up with a friend for drinks with our madcity cocktails drink book.   Decided to share a burger while we were there.   Couldn't separate checks or use both books unless we ordered more food.    The books are both per person not per table.   If we had not purchased any food we would have been fine apparently.   Strange to me.  Guess if we decide to try it again it will be sans food"}
{"text":"Been there twice in the last month and will not return.  The service? was good, but the food quality was marginal at best.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Wow - great brisket.  Generous portion too.  Excellent service.  I'd personally prefer fries and/or a wider choice of sides, but the home-made chips were tasty."}
{"text":"My feelings on the Thirsty Goat are neutral. My experience wasn't bad by any means, but I'm not exactly itching to go back.   The positives first:  + Nice atmosphere + Friendly waiter + Sides were very generous - the mashed potatoes, while not groundbreaking, were the best part of my meal + Interesting sauces; their house BBQ sauce has basil, which is a flavor I don't believe I've encountered in barbecue elsewhere  Negatives:  - My BBQ sandwich. I went for the pulled pork and is just isn't anything I look for in barbecue. The meat was bland, no smoky flavor. It still had quite a bit of silver skin/connective tissue that hadn't been trimmed off nor broken down. It was wet and sloppy and thus melted the bun; it had to be eaten with a knife and fork. They say the meat is prepared with dry rub to form a crust then smoked over a variety of hardwoods, but what I was served is reminiscent of tossing a chunk of pork into a slow cooker. No hint of smoke, seasoning, or bark. Maybe it just spent too long steaming in a tray after being smoked?    I think this place has potential, but next time I'll skip the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Great barbecue!! Never dry, though it is served without sauce (several very good options on the table). We dig this joint the most!   A couple tips- host staff needs training, as there is consistent confusion when being seated. And a stack or roll of napkins on the tables would be welcome, as I'm going to eat with my hands, dammit."}
{"text":"Bartenders are awesome but the DJ sucks Old school azz! Better music on a juke box somewhere else"}
{"text":"Ok, in Wisconsin on a football day you'd expect to have beer and spirits available. Shocking how the beer list had over 40 beers but I had to go through 7 to get something they actually had. The service stunk even tho the bar was pretty empty.   I stayed through halftime even after getting charged $10 for a baileys and creme... in Madison you can get this anywhere else for $6. Tried the food... totally unremarkable.  This place will be closed in 6 months if they don't get a handle on how to get drinks to the table, keep the bar stocked and figure out how to compete."}
{"text":"Service is slow but burgers are FANTASTIC! Loved the cheese curds appetizer, and I am obsessed with the house-made ranch. The Bacon & Egg burger was absolutely heavenly, and I can't wait to eat my way through the entire burger menu."}
{"text":"The service here was disappointing. For how empty the restaurant was, it was ridiculously slow. We arrived at the restaurant and stood around with some other folks at the \"please wait to be seated sign.\" The bartender finally shouted across the restaurant to tell the host there were people waiting at the entrance. It took over 5 minutes for our server to show up, and even longer to get our drinks. We tried the 3 meat sampler platter with the mashed potatoes as our side. Potatoes were probably the highlight, along with the ribs. Brisket was a little on the dry side, and more fat than I'd like but easy to wash down with the BBQ sauces. Good variety there -- ranging from Chipotle to House to Sweet and Sour sauces. Food was pretty good, but they really have to work on their service. Something that I found really odd was that after our server took our cards to pay for the bill, a different employee returned with them and the receipts. I definitely don't like the idea of multiple people dealing with our cards.... again, they really were not busy. Suggestion for other people: Order your meal at the bar. You'll probably get served quicker that way.  I'll probably go back at some point, but I definitely won't go out of my way to eat there again, or will I expect great service."}
{"text":"Very good beer choices, good service, reasonable smokehouse meats.  We enjoyed the outdoor patio on one of the first nice Saturdays of the season. The Radler on Tap was very good, and our server was attentive and courteous. He seemed to know the menu well and handled the tables well.  We had different combinations of the smokehouse combo platter.  Our server recommended the St. Louis ribs and I had the chicken and a side salad and my son had the sausage with the ribs and cinnamon apples. The ribs tasted ok, but they were very slim cuts (very little meat) and very well done ( borderline return to the kitchen).  The chicken was tasty and juicy, as was the sausage.  The cornbread was also a nicely toasted sweet mix.  We enjoyed the bourbon and house bbq sauce.  Overall, we agreed that the price was way too high for the quantity and quality - 4 slim ribs, 1 sausage....   Hopefully there are better menu choices because I can't recommend the smokehouse..."}
{"text":"Pretty nice bar with patient waitress. It's our first time to be there. And as Chinese, we did take some time reading the menu, the waitress is nice and explained some dishes and help us to find the nice meal for us."}
{"text":"When they first opened, I was truly impressed. They made a good drink. And I enjoyed the food. After 2 months, I've decided to go back, and it was awful. We got sat right away. But no server. After 10 minutes, I asked another waitress to find our server. My drink was terrible. I'm thinking they now use a mix. Whatever. I'll live. Kinda. Ordered our food and told the server, I'd like a salad in addition to my meal. I had to ask for my salad before my meal. She replied normally salads are served with the entree. Really? On my last visit I got it before, my meal. OK. Needless to say my salad was pre-made and someone dropped pulled chicken mixed in with my delicious wilted, brown leaves. Whatever. When she delivered our food my broasted chicken, it looked fried and had hardly any meat, my French fries were stale and soft. Did they just re-fry them? Yum! Here's the kicker....they must of recently started doing karaoke and it was sooooooooo loud, I could not hold a conversation. Are you kidding?  Good bye Goat."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night.   The place was full but not packed.   We ordered and waited, waited, waited for our drinks,  which I had to ask for again.   They finally came with our meal,  which was very odd.   Food was just ok,  I had half rack of ribs which was good,  but the sides - mac and cheese and coleslaw were lacking flavor big time.   Overall,  I'd come back for the beer (good selection) and skip the food."}
{"text":"This place has, without question, the best food in Fitchburg. I'd go so far as to say that their burgers are among the very best in the greater Madison area. I've eaten here several times, and every meal has been spot on.  I wish that I could give the Thirsty Goat 5 stars, because if I was only grading them on food, servers, and bar staff, I would. But their hostesses are terrible. I've been here more than once, and the hostesses have consistently been uninterested, preoccupied, and downright condescending. I'll gladly delete this review and replace it with a 5-star if my experience changes.   Go to this restaurant! Their food is incredible!"}
{"text":"Great lunch menu. Even better beer selection. Definitely a great choice for dinning out!"}
{"text":"4th time eating here, so I've got a bit to write.  First and foremost, the best brisket in town, bar none. I smoke my own Brisket, and this is almost exactly how I like to do my own.  Likewise, the brisket chili is delicious. I absolutely love  their nacho chips. I would buy bags of them if I could.  Bacon and egg burger is delicious, but the first time I ordered it, they were out of bacon, so they substituted pulled pork wothout telling or asking me. Not nearly as good that way, and when there was no apology or compensation.  That opens the less than favorable remarks. My advice is to eat at the bar. The three times we sat at a regular table, I swear it was amature hour. Even when the server was training in a new wait staff, it took forever to get drinks, and we only got sodas. Tonight our waitress is really hard to understand, has mixed up our drink order all 3 times, including the kids sodas. Kids chicken fingers come with fries... Ehen you ask 3 times for the fries, I guess.  It is not that busy, they just seem to be that... Distracted? Disinterested? Inept? We started asking any random server for the things we needed, and finally our server started paying attention to us. Maybe she noticed that I'm writing a Yelp review. 5 stars for the food (when you get what you order), 3 stars cuz it's a bit pricey, and 2 stars for service. Average out to 3"}
{"text":"Great view and atmosphere. They have outdoor seating available that looks very inviting for those summer days we'll be seeing soon. Very friendly staff and commendable service. Their menu has a wide range of options, including smokehouse meats, burgers, sandwiches, and salads. I had the bacon and egg burger- all I can say is yum! Probably one of the most well seasoned burgers I've ever eaten. My husband had the brisket which was also delicious and they have several of their own sauces which are very good."}
{"text":"It was okay. The half chicken was tasty and the meat fell off the bone. The side portions were smaller than what I was expecting and they weren't that tasty to me (baked beans that tasted right out of the can) and mixed veggies (which was steamed cauliflower and broccoli that was still cold in the middle- it made me think that it was a frozen bag of veggies that were steamed before serving, but not quite 100% done). There were roughly 35 or so beers on tap and a good selection for everyone in our group. A friend of mine had the sliders and he said that they were pretty good. Service was good and there were a lot of tvs for the big game of the day. There's a bigger bar area and a smaller one too (depending on your mood, I guess). Or, you can be in one of the bars and your sig other in the other one!"}
{"text":"Great place! Try it if you're looking for a new neighborhood pub/restaurant. One of my favorite dishes here is the chili. It's made with brisket and the bread bowls are fresh. My partner and I frequent this location and the lead manager is super nice and welcoming. It's usually not too busy during the early dinner crowd, but I've seen the bar pretty packed later on. Also, I've seen them host several bday parties and other group gatherings in their party room. Seems like a great place to get together with friends and/or family."}
{"text":"Be sure when you go to Thirsty Goat that you are HUNGRY. The portions here are enormous, we were so thankful that our great waitress mentioned that about the nachos or else we would have ordered too much. We still came home with 2 to-go boxes. Service was a 5! Like the other reviews mentioned, the nachos were delicious with their homemade chips. A HUGE portion though. We also tried the sampler platter, brisket is a definite 5!! So good! The cornbread also awesome. The ribs definitely missed the mark, and we didn't even want the sausage, would have preferred chicken. A big miss is the mac n' cheese, a BBQ place must have good mac... thirsty goat needs to work on that, just very bland and boring. We mentioned that to our waitress and she gave me more cornbread instead so thank you! Will be back."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Fitchburg! We came late at night, and they were incredibly accommodating and willing to serve us food even though  it was already after 9 PM. The staff was incredibly attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable on the menu. I had a pulled pork sandwich, which was to-die-for. They offered many great barbecue options, and serve four different homemade barbecue sauces on the side. My only complaint is that everything looked so good, it made ordering difficult! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was an ok spot! We went during peak time so the service was very slow. Although our waitress took our orders right away across from us the waitress totally forgot about them for about 30 min. The food is okay, very bland. Would I come back? Probably not. I'll just head over to famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Visiting my hometown and saw a new restaurant. It was really busy when I came. Ordered the brisket with spicy corn and mac n cheese. The portion of brisket I got was more fat than actual meat which was really disappointing. Probably needed some sauce to go along with it, but I never got any. The mac n cheese was not very good compared to The Old Fashioned's, Brickhouse BBQ's, or even The Great Dane's. It was just bland which is sad seeing I rarely get to eat Wisconsin mac n cheese nowadays. I'll probably stick with my usual restaurants when I visit Madison again."}
{"text":"Great meal! First time to visit and we will be back! My husband and I shared a half order of the nachos with pulled pork and they were fantastic! I had the sampler of ribs, brisket, and chicken. My husband had the smoked meatloaf. The food came out hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Went slightly before the lunch rush.   The first problem was that there was no one at the host station. It took 10 minutes to get sat, and they didn't even notice us standing there until another 3 tables piled up behind us.   We finally got sat, and while the new atmosphere and decor is neat, the tables are really not big enough. The two top my husband were at was not sufficient to fit an appetizer and two drinks, let alone anything else. The table is crowded with a wooden box containing wet naps, napkins, and silverware. We were also supposed to have the 4 sauce choices at the table, but they were missing. Coincidentally we also didn't get the sauces until our food had been out for a good 3 minutes.   We ordered fried cheese curds for an appetizer, and decided to split the sampler platter for our main course. The cheese curds were one greasy gooey mess. They weren't really structured into individual pieces, just one large clump of of batter and melted cheese. At the bottom was an actual pool of grease. Patting them down with napkins wasn't even helping.   The main course came with brisket, chicken, ribs, cornbread and 2 sides. We added an extra cornbread, because I'm awful at sharing it, and got the mac and cheese for the other side. For the meat, the ribs were amazing. Great flavor and pull apart. Very nice. It's the only reason this is a 2 instead of a 1. The brisket did not have an appropriate meat to fat ratio. It was all fat, and maybe 2 bites of edible meat. The chicken, was both good and bad. The flavor inside was well cooked and still moist. The outside was a nightmare of soggy under seasoned skin. The cornbread is served cold, which is always kind of a pet peeve for me. Finally the mac and cheese was the most bland I have ever come across. Salt and pepper, I'm generous amounts, still weren't enough to give it flavor. The BBQ sauces they have are ok, but nothing memorable.   Finally, we got the bill. The waitress asked how things were, and I told her pretty much everything I just wrote here. Her response was \"Sorry, that's really unfortunate. I'll be back with your bill\". I kind of really expected her to at least talk to management, but I was mistaken. I decided, after paying, to hunt down a manager to tell them about the experience. It's impossible to fix things if you aren't aware of them. This started anther 5 minute wait at the host station. A waitress showed up, and I asked for a manager. Her response will forever be burned in my mind as the most ridiculous things anyone could say to a customer. \"It's actually kind of the lunch rush. Could you come back later?\". I told her that no, I could not, I had just eaten. She finally clued in and grabbed the manager. She, the manager, seemed really understanding and legitimately sorry for the experience. She offered to comp the bill, but when she found out I'd paid by credit card, told me it wasn't an option. Instead I have a $25 gift card for $45 meal, for a place I really have no intention of returning to. So that's nice."}
{"text":"While in the Madison area for work, this was one of our stops to try the local fare.  Overall, I think that this establishment is OK.  Nothing to rave over, but definitely will help you fill a hungry belly while you can have a nice drink to wash it down.  Atmosphere wise, it's like many other local eateries with TV and a patio and lots of tables and booths.  The casual vibe is comfortable, even if the noise levels get high.  The food was average.  I tried several items and all of them hit be as good. I especially enjoyed my burger.  Service was friendly and prompt, even on a very busy night.  I recommend you stop by if in the neighborhood.  The fire pit will likely be running, even in negative degree weather."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and getting better with time.  Finally someone figured out how to open a neighborhood bar in this part of Fitchburg that isn't the Great Dane!  Nothing against the GD but options are nice!!!  Great BASE for a smokehouse BBQ menu and its gotten better each time they've revised it.  Lacking something other to do in terms of bar games/activities, but I'm sure they'll get there."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch. Cool place, nice ambiance. Its very large and they pack a lot of tables in the space they have but it works. You don't feel like you're on top the table next to you but you also feel like you're sharing the space with others, it hit the right balance.   As for the experience, I give them some slack since it just opened. Our server was mediocre. She was helping out in the bar too and it was a lunch rush. It was bad service, its just that I don't like to be left waiting.   The menu, I want to go back and try numerous items. I saw a lot of good looking plates come out. Ribs in particular. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich, great! They don't bread there sandwich so you get the real flavor rather than just the breading. My wife got the chicken dumpling soup, \"If I'm every sick you're coming here to get me this.\" She got the beans and the pulled pork sandwich, she was thrilled.   We'll be back, especially when its nice out to sit outside."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my sisters for some drinks and it was literally 5 people including the 3 of us.. So I was assuming the service would be faster since no one was here. Nope. Two bartenders and they were so busy trying to close for the night 2 hours early that we could hardly catch them for drinks. She made my sister a drink and substituted one of the alcohols with something else because they didn't have what they needed to make it..  Probably should have mentioned that before hand and we would have choose something else. She also complained about being there all day and it was her longest shift ever ect ect..not to us but the other bartender.. But if we can here you,  you mise well be speaking to us. So clearly our bartender just wanted to go home and could careless about serving us. Frustrating.  I would love to come back and try the food,  but I'll stay away from the bar."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and 32 beers on tap! End of story. I love the outdoor patio and the atmosphere. This is officially my new spot."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is rated so low; I've been here numerous times and every time its been great. The brisket is always super tender and the mac & cheese is great. I've never had bad service or waited long for anything. My favorite BBQ in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Update--here again. They e gotta work on dessert. The brownie was old and tasted like it had picked up bbq odor from kitchen. Bartenders are terrific!  This place gets being a back porch for the community  Had to try this beautiful patio in Fitchburg before winter!  The investment in revamping the space was worth it!!  Welcoming yet modern. Patio is large with a fire pit and view of the fountain.   We shared the sliders with our beer and wine. Beer is a bit pricey. House wine is $6 while non house is $8. The house cabernet was ok. The server needed us to order beer by the number on the menu.   The three sliders--brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken, were all delicious. The slider buns were soft and slightly sweet. All meat is served naked but no sauces on our table. I grabbed some from inside. The classic was my favorite, but the chipotle was  also good--not spicy hot. The tangerine sauce was especially good on the chicken. Price was too much--$11--for a appetizer of this size.   This place opened 2 weeks ago so some kinks will get worked out. The hostesses seemed confused and I got the sense that the staff didn't appreciate our asking for patio seating. The patio tables had no place settings or condiments. No wine list offered. No water offered.   Menu--Needs a vegetarian option, even though I'm all about the smoked meats.  Dessert option is only bread pudding. I'd suggest a second option at a minimum.   Bathroom was clean, functional and attractive.   Several large tvs made watching sports easy and yet the place was not too loud."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about.  Food is good but nothing stands out from everyone else in town.   Servers were polite, but still lost as far as menu options and location of it.  TVs all around makes its a great place to watch the game while snacking with friends."}
{"text":"The service we had from server Elyssa was pretty good (the only big problem with service was that it took forever for her to take our order) and was very accommodating of our special requests (our Nana wanted the music quieter, and she was very nice about it). The food we got for brunch was pretty substandard. We came as a party of 7, and two of us were vegetarians. The two vegetarians ordered the same thing (there were only two vegetarian options) - the veggie egg bake. It tasted like they had used cartons of egg instead of regular eggs, they threw a thin layer of spinach and veggies on top of that and a tiny sprinkling of cheese on the very top. During the baking process, the cheese got crispy and dry. It came out really kind of disgusting - gross eggs instead of real eggs, barely and veggies, and a thin layer of vulcanized cheese on top. The cornbread on the side was so dry and hard I barely wanted to eat it (plus it had a bacon flavor - maybe it was kept warm in the same area or maybe it was made with lard). The fresh fruit was the only good part of the meal, not that it was spectacular fruit, but yeah. My husband's brisket Benedict was OK. The components were all ok, but the hollandaise sauce could have been tastier. My cousin got a burger with a side of chips, and I tasted the chips, which were ok, but way too salty. I ordered a hot tea and was very disappointed when it came out and I learned that the ONLY tea bags they had were lemon flavored - they had no green or black tea. I am not a fan of lemon flavor, and it's pretty incredible to think a restaurant is serving hot tea without having black tea bags."}
{"text":"Decent food. Friendly staff. This was my 2nd time here. We got the nachos with pulled pork. It was fantastic! They load it up with cheese and beans. The chips are homemade, light and crispy. They are what makes the dish. The whole order is huge! So you may want to consider the half order, which is still big.   For the entree, I tried the brisket with mashed potatoes. The brisket was ok. I didn't get much smoke flavor and the meat wasn't as tender as I feel it should have been. But they have some really good BBQ sauce, so that helped.   The staff was very nice and friendly. They have a great outdoor seating section as well."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo my husband and I live down the road and have been there 2x in less than a week.  The first was for drinks so we could watch the Cubs game. And it was a blast. The bartender and the other employees there were super fun. We were the only two customers left at 12:30 and we kinda bonded. The night ended with my husband hugging the bartender. It was just a fun atmosphere.  The second time we went for lunch. The kitchen manager came out and explained to us that they were having a slight shortage of meats so sorry for the wait. But honestly it was worth it. My husband got the brisket....it was tasty and I love that they let you determine wich BBQ sauce and how much you want of it. I got the fried chicken and cornbread with coleslaw and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese could use some tweaking but OMG please don't change the cornbread recipe. Best freaking cornbread ever. And the most tasty and moist chicken I've ever had.  Needless to say we will be back and soon. I'm glad they opened up so close to us."}
{"text":"I would drink here vs eat here next time. Great beer list and it's a great set up. Love the decor.  I got a cup of the brisket chili ($5.99), pulled pork sandwich with house made chips ($7.99) and a warped speed scotch ale ($5.00)  The chili was awful. Just beans and brisket. A very small cup (which is fine bc I didn't like it) but for $6.00 was kind of a rip off. I must say the pulled pork was delicious. Soft bun and lots of meat.  The house made chips tasted stale with no seasoning.  Again, I'd definitely come back to drink, but prob eat at home first."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ and fish fry, but still has salads and burgers for those not in the mood for BBQ. The pulled pork sandwich on brioche was perfect, the burgers cooked perfectly. I also recommend the bread pudding! All of menu items are reasonably priced and the service great. My family and I fully intend on making the Thirsty Goat a regular place for us to eat."}
{"text":"Checked out The Thirsty Goat for their Sunday brunch. Nothing plain about the brunch menu. Nearly all dishes included a signature bbq meat of some kind.   I had the brisket Benedict. Lots of tender beef brisket atop an English muffin, then topped with perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.... delicious!  Unfortunately, the cubed potatoes served with my Benedict weren't hot enough, and seemed to be of frozen origin.  My fruit cup was a lovely, fresh combination of grapes, blueberries and one strawberry.  My mate enjoyed his waffle covered with scrambled eggs, brisket, onions and cheese. His only complaint was the shredded cheese on top should have been melted.    Our waiter was a fine multi-tasker and friendly.  They really do a great job of bringing BBQ and breakfast together!"}
{"text":"When I stepped in I was impressed with the new decor.  The place has been completely renovated and looks completely different than the former restaurant (Casa del Sol).  It was very busy so I waited at the host station to put my name in for a table.  It was quite a while before the hostess showed up, and as the evening progressed I saw why.  She was not only greeting and seating people, she appeared to be assisting with busing and resetting tables and was tho only host.  They need two or three people to do that job. She  was very pleasant and welcoming.  Although there was a wait list we were seated within 10 minutes because we were a table of two.  Again, though, we waited quite a while to be greeted by a server, but she was very pleasant and friendly when she arrived at our table.   She showed us the large beer menu and we chose a Pumpking beer to share.  My water arrived promptly but my companion waited quite a long time for his beer.  When the server delivered it she apologized for the wait.   Although the decor was very nice, the place was noisy and frenetic.  TVs all over the place, music blaring, lots and lots of people.   We ordered our drinks and food together thinking it would speed things up.  Not so.  Several tables near us who were seated after us received their food but still nothing for us.  Finally, about 1/2 hour after placing our order, our server stopped by to say she talked to her manager asking why our table's food wasn't ready.  She said it would be out shortly.  She said she would try to get us a free dessert or something due to the long wait.   Our food arrived about 10 minutes later, again with an apology from the kitchen person who delivered it.  He said they were having a problem with the printer.  Another person named Steph also stopped by to apologize and offered us another beer.  We declined, telling her that we don't drink much and one was enough.  She said, \"next time you come in tell them you have one coming due to a long wait.\"  Right.  I don't think that's going to work.  Ok, so we finally have our food, almost an hour after arriving.  I had a pulled pork sandwich, served with kettle chips and coleslaw.  The pork was extremely fatty, to the point where I had to unwrap another set of silverware in order to use a napkin to cover the bites I couldn't eat.  Oh yeah, no napkins on the table.  That's a big mistake at a barbeque place.  You only get one, use it well.  Other bites of my pork had gristle or bone or something hard that wasn't meant to be chewed.  What I could eat was good but I got tired of picking through it and gave up.  The chips were crispy, but had absolutely no flavor, no salt, nothing interesting about them.  The coleslaw was pretty basic.  My companion had brisket, a side salad, baked beans and cornbread.  All the sides were good, but he said the brisket was extremely fatty and was cold, not warm.  Think about this - nothing that we ordered had to be made to order.  Barbeque is prepared in advance, as are all the sides, yet it took 40-45 minutes to get our food.  So, we are done eating, and again, a long wait for the check.  Although our server asked if we wanted dessert she never offered it as a complementary item as she had suggested earlier in the evening.  We declined dessert.  The only item on the menu was bread pudding, which neither of us care for.  We finally paid our bill (in full as no discount was offered for the long wait).  I added a good tip for the server as none of this was her fault.  Another odd thing - our server told this that Thirsty Goat is a local place, not a chain.  She even pointed out the owner.  I saw him walking around the restaurant thoughout our time there. He did NOTHING to help keep things moving - never talked to the customers, never intervened on a problem, just wandered around and around and around.  Once he brought out some placements to set on a table that had just been cleared but no one was ever seated at this table, for at least 1/2 hour, even though I could clearly see customers waiting in the foyer.  The owner once got silverware packets and filled a few of the racks on the tables but I also saw him drop a handful on the floor, pick them up, and put them on a table.  GROSS!  Yes, they were wrapped but someone was going to then use that napkin (you only get one) on their mouth.    When we left not one single person said thanks folks, see you again soon, good bye, nothing.  I was disappointed because on top of all this, we also missed the movie we had been planning on because everything was so slow.  I wanted to like this place but they have more than opening problems to tweak.  The food wasn't awful but it was only meh.  The servers were nice but the service was sloooow.  The owner needs to either interact and help or stay out of the way.  The offerings of a comp need to be made more sincerely in a way that could be used.  All in all, I might try it again but it will have to be after I hear some good reviews."}
{"text":"Food is just ok(I've had much better bbq elsewhere) and service is just plain bad. I have Celiac and am allergic to gluten. When I asked my waitress what on the menu was GF she said \"everything but the bread\". Well that's not true. I had to speak with a manager and even she was a bit uncertain. Sorry but you should know what's on your menu and what's in the food.   Thankfully I didn't get sick. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Had the smoke house sample platter. Everything was dry... should be called the jerky platter. Cocktails seemed weak for the price."}
{"text":"Decided to try the Thirsty Goat for brunch on our anniversary. Seemed promising just by looking at the menu. Things went downhill very fast. Our waitress promptly apologized about the bar service and claimed \"it's a mess.\" Our Bloody Mary's were poorly made and didn't come as described in the menu. No celery salt on the rim, missing vegetables, and the vegetables that were in it, were limp and seemingly old. Then our food arrives, both of our orders were missing the fresh fruit. My smoked salmon was cooked and dry but cold. My wife's chicken and waffles were dry and the chicken was obviously store bought frozen boneless wings. She was expecting at least a real piece of fried chicken. Very disappointing at all aspects.  Both my wife and I have worked in the food service and hospitality industries and decided it better to mention the issues instead of just writing a bad review. The manager quickly apologized and said he would comp the whole meal. This definitely made us feel better about the experience.  We left a tip for the waitress and were about to leave, only to be given a bill. Only the Smoked Salmon Benedict was comped! Ridiculous! We will never be back. I suggest you do the same and cross this place off the list."}
{"text":"We had a really nice night having a couple of drinks and some appetizers on the patio.  Gabriel was a fantastic waiter and did went well out of his way to make sure that we had a fantastic experience.  This was my 5th time here and every stop has been great.  The food is good, but the service is what sets this place apart.  This is probably the best restaurant in Fitchburg."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many bad reviews on here. We went for a birthday party and it was fun, tons of beer options, food was excellent, and service was great. I had the brisket sandwich. It was large and tons of brisket. Brisket was so tender and flavorful, really enjoyed it. It came with chips that were excellent! In fact I tried a fry of someone else's and I preferred the chip option. There are other sides you can substitute also for an up charge. All nine of us enjoyed what we ordered, our server was great - he passed the water refill challenge. My only tiny complaint is it is really LOUD, but we were there for a party, so didn't really matter. Probably not the place for a quiet romantic dinner. Can't wait to go back!"}
