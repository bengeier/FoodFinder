{"text":"I would take left over mall pizza before I would go here again. The crust/bread is extremely bland and has no taste. The marinara sauce for the breadsticks tasted equivalent to the sauce that comes in a can of spaghetti o's. Horrible pizza and I do not recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered through Grub Hub.  There Gyro's were fantastic, pizza was very good along with the cheese cake.  The food showed up very hot and right on time.  Very good experience."}
{"text":"Just so-so pizza.  Not bad, just not very flavorful.  Had it today and the pepperoni is sliced so thin it is almost see through and the sausages are very tiny and have no flavor.  The sausages definitely do not taste like Italian sausage.  To be honest, brown and serve sausages have more flavor. Great size, wonderful portions-just not very memorable.  Have you ever eaten a meal and the thought was of taste was still with you and you said \"wow that was good\" or \"good food\" well you won't have that sensation here.  We both thought the same thing \"oh that was edible\" but that's all.  Order at your own risk.  Maybe your tastes might be toward skimpy toppings and pizza toppings with no discernible taste."}
{"text":"There are very few times in life that I feel compelled to send my food back but this time could not be avoided. First when I called to place my delivery order it felt as I was being rushed off the phone. The girl didn't even give me a quote time for when my food would be delivered. And by my surprise it took over an hour for my food to arrive. And even more surprising my food was cold for starters. I ordered a pizza with two toppings and it barely had either of those toppings on the pizza. I had full sliced with out one or the other topping. I also ordered 20 wings split into two flavors. The wings were way over cooked and looked as though they had only been drizzled with sauce. They were so dry ranch didn't even help. At this point I decided to call and speak to the manager. I told him my situation and he immediately got frustrated with me as if this was some how my fault. At first his only solution was they were going to bring me another pizza which I very obviously didn't want. Then he very rudely told me \"I'll just send my driver back to get it and I guess refund part of your money\". I demanded a full refund and will NEVER order from this place again."}
{"text":"DONT ORDER DELIVERY!!!!!! the girl that answers is RUDE AS EVER, lies about the time, does not get the order right AND STILL ARGUES WITH YOU AFTER TWO HOURS WAITING FOR THEM, that \"it got backed up\" I also asked for a manager and she stated \"he doesn't speak English\" ummmm WHAT?! Never apologized, argued with me... Just a bad experience!! Delivery driver was nice, but that's it. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"90 minutes of waiting after being told it would take approx 45-60. Tried reasoning with a manager that states they are the owner (Jose was the name, not sure if telling the truth), only to be met with confrontation. Instead of attempting to right the situation or provide understanding feedback, the immediate response was negative and condescending.   For food, I would rate a 3. All of it is pretty bland, but it's almost reminiscent of the pizza you would get as a kid at a party.   Unfortunately, the rating dropped immensely when this incident occurred. The last few times it took a while to get here, but it's understandable being a small business. 90 minutes then getting told off is not okay. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't stop amazing me. TO ANYONE READING THIS DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS TRASH PLACE.  ... the pizza is good but the service is f** horrible. The owner (JOSE) had the nerve to reject me getting a discount. I was a loyal customer for months but today Im done with this place.  - So I get my pizza cold a couple of times, about 2 hours to get it at one point. I ALWAYS order red crushed pepper and they also forgot it too. I complained to Jose he said I had to speak to \"the manager\" to get a discount because I had been complaining before so I didn't expect them to mess up my order again. I asked him for his name and I told him next time he would verify my story. He said \"yeah my name is Jose speak to the manager next time.\" - I called a second time and the girl picked up (don't know her name). Anyways .. I tell her what happened and she says she doesn't have my address written in the \"bulletin board\" for compensations of messed up orders. She tells me she will write it and Next Time I'll get it.  - which brings it to today 5/01 * I just called about an hour ago and another guy picked up. I explained once again what happened. I was telling him Its not about the fucking discount it's about getting my order right !!!!! He told me Jose and the girl would arrive soon so I called back. Jose answered and told me that HE WAS THE MANAGER , that he never promised me a discount, (this was the guy that told me he would verify my story to the manager) turns out this A****** is the manager. What type of place is this?  Yeah the pizza is good but its not worth ordering from a place where they PROMISE YOU THINGS AND DON'T stick to their promises. As a loyal customer I expected more of them. Not to mention they have changed the size of pizzas. Reducing the amount you get. An EXTRA LARGE is LITERALLY THE SAME SIZE AS A LARGE. I've kept the boxes to determine if I was going crazy or not. Anywho thanks for all the times I got cold pizza WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN .. AND FOR YOU JOSE LEARN HOW TO RUN A BUISNESS. If you don't keep your customers happy eventually even if the product is OKAY BECAUSE even dominos is better and cheaper!!! But seriously, you will loose all your customers."}
{"text":"im upset i can not give zero stars! I ordered pizza for my kids and guests from this place... an hour and 15 mins later still no pizza so I call to check the eta... the girl who answered put me on hold to call the driver and told me when she came back that the driver should be pulling up any minute and she's sorry for the delay... I ACCEPTED THAT.... 30 minutes later still no pizza.... It gets delivered FINALLY but now I'm pissed... so I call back! ((Of course i waited so they didn't mess with my food )) not only was it late but it was cold! The chese had alreay hardened and everything. Anyhoo, I asked for the manager to tell him that i think it's ridiculous that after originally being quoted 45-60 min wait and calling to check the status that it was still another half hour i had been waiting... I asked why it took 30 more minutes after the gal that i talked to when I called the first time told me it would be delivered  \"ANY MINUTE\" He said well the wait is an hour and 30 minutes... I said it isn't even the weekend yet why such a large wait... He then argued that it IS infact a weekend ((????)) Ok... sure dude, its only Thursday but OK!  then he dismissed the fact that I told him I was lied to if intact the wait is an hour n 30 minutes ((when I ordered AND when I called to check on it)) then he argued with me saying that if it was horrible service and I'm that unhappy with the wait that I shouldn't order from them anymore!  Hold up...WHAT?? He said he would refund my money if i wanted but he was coming to pick up the pizza. This was not my first time orderig from them yet for some reason i tried them again. Ive had a long wait time issue before but this time i was fed up. in total it was close to 2 hours before i finally got my order. i was lied to and disrespected by the \"manager\" because he was pushing the blame on me for bad service...not only that he argues with me for 10 minutes on the phone calling me a liar when i caught him in lie after lie about what the wait time should be and what it actually was...a manager should not argue with a customer. When i asked, he said his name was Jose and refused to tell me his last name...I don't believe a manager should be treating PAYING CUSTOMERS this way... I'll never go back to them as a customer"}
{"text":"taste good. get a lot for the money. I wish they had smaller pizza choices lol but bomb wings and pizza"}
{"text":"I rarely write a bad review unless it's absolutely warranted and this place deserves zero stars. My order took an hour and a half (!) to get to us and, as you would expect for food made an hour ago, it was all cold. I called before our food showed up and a girl answered, she couldn't have been bothered any less about my order, and she rudely and hurriedly told me if the food wasn't there in five minutes she would then be able to help and HUNG UP on me.   As for the food it was horrible. The pizza looked like it stayed out a bit after being made and the cheese looked old. It also had no flavor, how can a pizza have no flavor?! The sandwhich bread was soggy. The \"breadsticks\" are a far cry from being a breadstick, they looked more like a thick tortilla cut into strips with no flavor at all. It was like eating absent matter, it exists yet it doesn't. Water tastes better and is more filling than these \"bread matter strips\". The only slight saving grace were the buffalo wings and those still were not good.  I feel for the owners of this restaurant, they are going to go under -- fast. Horrible food and horrible customer service. Never again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I have gotten 2 different threatening messages from people affiliated with the business over my review. Super classy."}
{"text":"Good pizza! but the pizza had slid over to the corner of the box and was smashed on one side. Other then that it was fast and great service."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst pizza place that i have ever experienced.. On a few different levels. First off, my original order was delivered incorrect. After i got the correct order, the elapsed time had been about 2 hours and 10 minutes. Bread sticks? I would feel bad feeding these \"bread sticks\" to the ducks at the park! Then to top it all off, the lasagna that i ordered had what appeared to be MOLD on the ends of the noodles, AND as a cherry on top, about three bites into my chicken parm sandwich (worst one i have ever had) i pull out a nice LONG HAIR stuck between the bite in my mouth and the sandwich. I just about threw up. I really wish i could add pictures to this recview! Im NOT a review writer, however i took the time out of my day not to review this restaurant, but to warn people about it. DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"No Stars. This was worst pizza I have had ( God I miss Chicago pizza) order a 2 liter soda a xxl pepperoni pizza and order of wings. Told be here in 45 minutes but got here in 1.5 hours. Then my family ate the pizza was cold not warm cold like sitting some where for several hours. When we got the wings the were dry and nasty like they sat under heat lamp for 4 hours the sauce was barely on them. They couldn't even get the soda right. Then the manager says he would be more then happy to send out new order if we had not eating old one so I could probably wait another hour and a half to get God knows what for family to eat. You've been warned"}
{"text":"Alright... We gave them another shot, just because they have good prices on wings and pizza... We actually really enjoy their feta cheese and bacon pizza! Piping hot and very good!! The wingz are sauced perfect and for the price of pizza and wingz, it was well worth it!! This time they made sure to be to my place within 45!! Good job making up for our last experience!!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza for the price and delivery is on time. Eat here if you wanna save money but also have pizza better than frozen pies from the store."}
{"text":"First off, we got shorted 2 wings. Secondly, 3 of the 18 wings we actually received were completely disgusting, burnt, and inedible. The remainder of the wings were at least edible, but weren't anything to get excited about. Guess the wings are cheap for a reason. In addition, the delivery time was atrocious, nearly an hour and a half. The only reason I'm not giving them a 1-star, is because the 2-liter they delivered was nice and cold. Refrigeration of a beverage, that's all I can recommend them for."}
{"text":"We've been getting coupons on our door for a year now, so we figured we would try it. The order took over an hour to get here and the pizza was cold. The crust was dry and was oddly reminiscent of the wafer crackers you get at church communion and the toppings were nearly nonexistent and virtually flavorless. The wings tasted like dry twigs dipped in Tabasco sauce. I don't want a refund-- I would literally pay them to stop littering my door with their coupons."}
{"text":"Meh! Just ordered through Grubhub. Got the margarita pizza and cheesecake. The pizza was fresh, but extremely lacking in flavor. The tomatoes weren't even red, they were a very pale pink. Delivery guy was pleasant, but probably won't bother to order from them again. Yawn! Cheesecake was equally boring. It is not \"bad\" food, just bland and nothing special. I would just pass!"}
{"text":"The pizza has NO FLAVOR! It tastes like it is FRESH and looks really delicious but has NO FLAVOR!   Driver was rude. Insisted that we tell him our \"lot number\" even though it said on the directions \"Lot xxx OR RV Clubhouse\". AND the directions said \"go to the RV Clubhouse straight in and park.\" Driver hung up on my wife three times!"}
{"text":"Ok, let's start by saying that the little girls who work there are probably not even 16. The older one who wears nothing but skanky clothes ALWAYS has an attitude with customers. Literally wearing short crop tops when she's working, like ???? When we first started ordering we liked it because the pizza was good and wings were nice and hot. Last two times we've ordered, not only was I lied to saying that they don't do flatbread when I've ordered a million times from here before, but the pizza came out BURNED. LAST TWO TIMES I ORDERED. How does that happen? The pasta which I tried once was disgusting, it was like watered down sauce with no seasoning. Keep in mind I actually use to order from here a lot. But not anymore, if I could give 0 stars I would. Awful place."}
{"text":"Gather 'round friends, it's time to learn the hardcore truth about OLYMPUS PIZZA!  1. You will not get what you ordered. Don't try to reason with the owner. He doesn't care. He'll deliver whatever the f*** he wants.  2. The owner (Jose) does not care about your business. Jose is not interested in correcting or apologizing for a mistake. He would rather come get his shitty food and refund your money.  3. Their food looks and smells horrible. The wings were literally burnt. The pizza is the large equivalent of a \"Totinos\" frozen pizza. The sausages are poor quality. Think McDonald's breakfast burrito sausages... I swear, they are the same tiny sausages that McDonald's uses! Please see pictures of the \"suspect\" sausages below lol.   4. Olympus Pizza is in the same price range as Barros, Venezia's and  Domino's! You don't need to eat this horrible food! Treat yo self.  5. I am proud to present Olympus Pizza with 1 full star! Even though I made them come get their shitty food soon after it was delivered, I was swiftly refunded.  This was my first time ordering here. I'll never order from Olympus Pizza again! I hope they go out of business."}
{"text":"not even a one star bitch was hella rude when she answered the phone like bitch go get a new job if u dobt like what u do and the guy who answered the phone after i asked to speak to someone eles was a idiot for letting her act the way she did they both need to get a new job customer service is number one we make ur paycheck u idiots."}
{"text":"Wish you guys would stop littering my apartment complex with your menus. It feels like you and one other pizza place are competing on who can harass residents the most with unwanted trash. We make it a habit to never buy from businesses who do this.  *Update: To this day they still litter. Uploaded a photo of three menus dumped outside of our door. There were more in the breezeway. We truly will not ever buy from places that do this. It's a disgusting waste of paper and purposeful littering."}
{"text":"Ordered the gyro a couple times from here & it's delicious! Ordered the Philly Steak sub recently, and it was OK. There was not a lot of meat or toppings on it. There's not a lot of menu items, but it just opened up so maybe they'll expand soon. The price is cheap for what you get, and delivery is always on time or early! Never had an issue when ordering from here."}
{"text":"I've only had one problem where I was put on hold for over 6 minutes and forgot about, called back the owner was very apologetic and rushed my order. Pizza is good, big feeds a big family, wings are good. If you wanted \"crazy good pizza\" go to Grimaldi's? We will definitely eat here again, as we have since we moved out to Mesa."}
{"text":"Have been waiting over an hour and still no pizza and they have already charged my card. Oh there here now with their cold pizza but since they already charged my card I have to take it. Thanks Olympus Service sucks the delivery guy was rude and accepted no responsibility. Don't eat here because if you don't want it their way then good luck"}
{"text":"I am sorry to see the bad reviews on here. We order here all the time. The prices are great and the pizza and wings are delicious.  We always get the xxl pizza and 20 wings deal for football Sunday.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is gross! AND the delivery service takes way to long. Dont WASTE YOUR TIME"}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service ever. They essentially stole from me. I ordered some pizza for delivery, I never received the order but they still charged my card for it. The next day I call back to ask for a refund and they tell me they won't refund the order because they \"tried\". This is no way to do business, that small refund would of kept a loyal customer but they are dead to me now. Stay away from Olympus Pizza unless you like getting your money stolen."}
{"text":"I can't give them a star, as it was the worst pizza I have ever had. (had to give it one star to leave a review). The crust was tasteless,  hardly any sauce or cheese.  The ham was sliced so thin that you could read through it. IT IS JUST HORRIBLE PIZZA. DON'T ORDER IT."}
{"text":"waited an hour and 10 minutes no pizza . Called and of course it is on its way , No thanks keep it. This is a Monday at 2 pm a very slow time in the pizza business no excuses. I wont call them again"}
{"text":"Great gyros and burgers are cooked on a flame. Pizza is ok depending on what you order on it. If you order too many toppings it doesn't seem to get cooked fully through."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying first off in a world full of technology, if you work for a pizza place that delivers; you should not get lost or can't find the address to where you need to deliver food. HOT FOOD at that. The pizza is equivalent to a cheap ass flavorless, sauce-less, pizza. 7-11 has better pizza than this place. The 20 piece wings sucked, find a chicken that actually has meat on it so that way when you over cook the wings there is something inedible to chew on. I will never waste my money on this establishment. The owner should pay people to try this shi**y place. As always if there was a rating less than a star not only would you have earned it but deserved it as well."}
{"text":"Great, cheap pizza. Subs are cheap and ok. The Gyros are the bomb. Just got back from 2 years in Buffalo, NY and this pizza is, I know I Know better than NY. The Gyros are darn good also. Dont get the bad reviews???? What do you guys expect from a little dive pizza place? Been eating their for years all is good."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza at 7:26pm and was told when i called at the hour mark 8:26pm that he was on his way, it would be 10 minutes, it took 20.  We ended up waiting an hour and 20minutes for pizza and cheese bread.   Will not order from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered 10 BBQ wings and a large cheese pizza. The person on the phone said 45 minutes. An hour and a half later, I had my food. The wings were rubbery and tasted like somthing burnt. The pizza was cold and Little Cesears tastes better for less. All in all poor experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"$20 pizza and wings deal is amazing. Can never go wrong with it. Pizza is thin as hell,But it's a good thin. Always come to them for pizza orders."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent portions. The staff was great and very helpful . This place is perfect for ordering for big gatherings. I will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"One of our residents gave us half of a pizza yesterday and it smelled and looked AMAZING! I had just eaten lunch and was beyond full but couldn't wait to try a bite. I ate one piece while still at work (DELICIOUS!) and then sadly dropped the rest in the parking lot walking to my car. So today we decided to order our own here in the office. I called the resident up to see where he got it from and immediately looked it up to order when I saw all of the horrible reviews that made me really nervous. I called a few times with no answer (understandable, because it was like 1105am). When I finally got through, I placed our order (Large pizza with 6 toppings) and he told me it would be $12.95.. I thought for sure he got our order wrong after reading all of the bad reviews. I made sure to choose pick up because its like a half mile from us and I was starving, and we had a backup plan of where to get food from next if it was wrong lol. When I picked up our order 20 mins later, the staff were extremely friendly, our pizza was made exactly how I had ordered, it was in fact only $12.95, and piping hot.  The people comparing to dominos or little caesars is interesting to say the least.. as both of their pizzas taste like cardboard and Olympus is one of the best pizzas I've had. I didn't mess with delivery since we are so close, but for the price and the flavor this place deserves 5 stars. I'm going to end up looking like a fat Italian with this being so close!"}
{"text":"This place does it for me.  Delivery usually takes them less than the quoted time, the salads are good, the pizza is good, the sandwiches and gyros are good.  Prices are great."}
{"text":"Way decent pizza. The crust was lighter and sweeter than I particularly care for. The bargain makes it ok."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall pizza place has horrible pizza. We got a large pie. Hardly any sauce, tasteless (i had to salt it), and small slices. We'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered Sausage and Olive pizza on Grubhub. Delivered early, friendly driver. Pizza was fantastic!  Definitely order again."}
{"text":"Not too horrible. The pizza taste alright but nothing special. They do have good prices and the pizza is quite big."}
{"text":"So in being new to the area myself, I have been trying the food around my home. I decided to give Olympus Pizza a shot and I'm sad to say that I did. I ordered 3 simple things; wings, a salad, and some fries for my daughter. Maybe my expectations are too high, but if you pay $6.50 for a Caesar salad, you expect it to be bigger than a handful and a half of lettuce with flavorless croutons. The dressing was good though, I can admit that. Now my daughter likes her fries cold so she was okay but I don't like knowing that they pass off cold fries as fresh. The wings were sadly as disappointing as the salad. They were basically just covered in grease, I've never seen mild wing sauce that didn't stick to the wing at all before. The container just had a puddle of grease at the bottom. At least they were not cold. I actually regret giving the delivery guy a $5 tip for bringing this mediocre food to my home. I can certainly say that I will never order from them again unless they change the price to equate what you are getting. I'll give 2 stars just because I haven't tried everything to judge more harshly."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I ordered a gyro and some fries.  I dont know if they were running low on meat but I had at most about 4 strips of meat.  However,  they didnt skimp on the sauce.  I had to scoop alot of it out.  Its not that good anyway, didnt finish my meal.  The fries were pretty soggy too.  My bag over all was wet too.  Not sure from what either.  Took them over an hour to get here, which is surprising since I only ordered a gyro and some fries and it was the middle of the week.  Overall, not happy with this place.  Had I eaten there in person, I wouldve demanded a refund.  Price wasn't terrible for what I got, but still food not worth it."}
{"text":"Just ordered on Grubhub.  This restaurant will never get my business again.  First the good.  1 star was for the gal on the phone who was helpful and friendly you are appreciated.  1 star because although coolish the burger was tasty.  Now the bad.  It took 20 mins longer than the expected time approx 1 hr 20 mins.  The fries were stale and cold and the breadsticks were the worst I've ever had... Little Caeser's are better.  Last but worst of all... my alfredo had very little sauce and tasted bland.  For an italian/pizza jpint when the burger is the only redeeming factor it might be time to step back and think.  The gal on the phone should get a raise I'm just sorry I didn't catch her name so she could be seen here."}
{"text":"No trespassing ARS (Arizona Revised Statues) signs posted, still trespassed anyway. Left one of these flyers on my door when I was overseas, had random people casing my home as a result. I see one more flyer, I'm filling trespassing charges."}
