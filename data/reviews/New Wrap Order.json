{"text":"Go. Or don't. Meh. I ordered the bowl, with chicken, Mongolian style. It was cold and included several pieces of beef. Also, I asked for pimento cheese as my side with wonton chips and received the avocado crema. Chips were heavy and crema was underwhelming. I liked the fresh chopped broccoli and the overall flavor of my dish, but it would have been better served hot, especially given the price. Won't seek them out again, but if it's between becoming hangry and eating, I'll deal. Go, if you must."}
{"text":"Love getting New Wrap Order for lunch. They have a decent variety of wraps(or bowls) and their ingredients don't taste processed or stale. Great value considering how much you get form a food truck typically. Known for the sauces for a reason."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money.  I got the steak bowl west coast style.  It was too salty and the bacon bits were so hard it almost cracked my tooth.  Not even a little bit good.  Total waste of $10.01.  Boo!"}
{"text":"HELP!!! I cannot stop thinking about the avocado basil crema sauce that is served on the traditional bowl! Hands down the best wrap I have ever had! Fresh Chef inspired food that is made quickly and is so tasty, it'll make you forget your name! Wonchos are a shareable appetizer that will not last long. Dirty south wonchos (hint: add chicken) are my favorite. The food truck is owned and operated by two very nice guys! Can't wait until they have a permanent space so I can get wonchos anytime of the day."}
{"text":"Love the concept of different flavors around the world that you can try at this ONE food truck! We tried three wraps - 1. Dirty South, 2. Caribbean 3. West Coast. 

If your looking for something fresher/lighter side; definitely go with the West Coast with Chicken. The avocado brings the wrap together. 

If your looking for something more hearty, go for the Dirty South with Steak. It has PIMENTO cheese in it!! Need I say more? Yumm! 

Caribbean speaks for itself. The plantain chips and toasted coconut bites gave it the perfect crunch and a touch a sweetness."}
{"text":"These guys are great. I try and stay as objective as possible while writing these but man, you really can't beat NWO in my book!

I remember the first time I tried the food at the Cotswold Food Truck Rally and it was as close to 'love at first sight' gets for a burrito bowl. My go-to: Mongolian Steak bowl. Marinated steak served on a bed of rice with a savory sauce, peppers, CARAMELIZED onions, and broccoli. The rice, consistently perfect; the broccoli, always crisp and flavorful. Onions are actually caramelized, not burnt, or saut√©ed until shriveled, or however else people try and interpret caramelized, they give a real complex dimension to the whole bowl.

Others I have tried are the Dirty South and Mediterranean style but you should always check out the window and ask about the special styling. A couple of months ago they did a Mole sauce that was outstanding. Not too spicy but a perfect compliment to the steak. Check out the Wonchos as well for some crunchy wonton chips with big, bold flavor combinations.

The crew does a great job cranking out delish food FAST. They're catering experts and even have 2 trucks to serve the Charlotte metro. They have a few usual spots throughout the week (NASCAR plaza Wednesday, one of the Food Truck Rallies on Friday) but are subject to change due to private events or venue change of plans etc. Fortunately they are really good at putting their weekly schedule up on the usual social media sites. Keep track of them on Facebook or Twitter.

For the quality, variety, and price, it really is the whole package in a truck. Look for me if you see the truck, I'll probably be somewhere nearby licking my bowl clean!"}
{"text":"The marinated chicken Mongolian style was very good! So stoked they came to our event at work. Fresh ingredients done right."}
{"text":"This is my first experience here and I LOVED it! I got the wrap with steak and it was west coast style. The wrap part wasn't too heavy but it was a good soft wrap. The steak WASN'T chewy, it was moist and had great additional flavor. On my wrap there was also a basil avocado creamy sauce and it was fresh and amazing. I also ordered the traditional wanchos (wonton nachos). This also had the basil cream sauce and beans, tomatoes and fried wonton chips. I would recommend this place to everyone. : )"}
{"text":"This truck has some of the freshest ingredients and their wraps and bowls explode with flavor... I'm literally drooling thinking about the Mongolian style wrap with the most tender juicy steak. 

Not to mention the Wonchos (fried wonton style nachos) are something out of this world. If you get your wrap in a bowl, I would recommend grabbing a side of fried wontons to scoop up that goodness. 

Also I grabbed a wrap from them one night, and had a couple of hours before I could eat it (torture) but after being in the fridge it held up so well I swear it tasted even better. They're definitely doing something right."}
{"text":"New Wrap Order offers flavorful options from wraps to bowls to their signature wonchos. This is one of my favorite food trucks in the area. I was hooked when I tried the Asian style wonchos for the first time. The wonchos are triangular shaped friend wonton wrappers. Then topped with pulled pork, onions, red peppers and a savory sweet Asian sauce. It's a good portion size and is a new take on traditional nachos.  When I ate them back in my office, everyone said they smelled and looked great. Then they had to try some for themselves.

The set up offers everyone choices. First you pick your protein (and there is a mushroom option for non-meat options). Then you pick whether you want a wrap or bowl. And then you pick a style. Some options have lettuce vs. rice as a base so it's more like a salad. I can't remember them all but there's Asian, Mediterranean,  dirty south, West coast, classic and there's often a truck special at the window. Asian style is my personal favorite.  And Woncho options come in Asian and dirty south. 

Then you can make your wrap into a combo with a drink and side of plain wonchos with either basil avocado cream sauce or jalapeno pimento cheese. Both are great options. 

I catch the truck at NASCAR Hall of Fame on Wednesdays. Try it! There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Got to try these guys at the Charlotte Food Fight 2016. Their entry were the Wonchos (wonton skin nachos) topped with mangoes, cloister honey and other goodies. Delicious but very sweet. More of a dessert than an appetizer for me. The only thing that would have made it better would have been a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream!!

Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"Every bite was amazing. We all got the traditional bowl with steak. It was fast, it was fulfilling and it was tasty. I will look on FB for their schedule. A must have again."}
{"text":"NWO is wonderful! They catered our wedding and provided amazing food for a lot of people. They are professional, responsive and easy to work with. They helped make our day amazing. Try them next time they are parked near you, their food is fantastic; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We ate from New Wrap order when they were parked at NoDa. I was pretty impressed with their offerings! The Asian style wanchos were the clear favorite and should be a must order when ever you find yourself near this food truck. I also had a delicious Caribbean wrap... I loved the crunchy bits of plantains and the Jamaican jerk sauce! My boyfriend got the traditional wrap. I had a taste and wasn't that impressed with his selection. Compared to the bold flavors in the wanchos and my wrap, it just kinda fell flat."}
{"text":"Hey wow, another food truck to try in Charlotte! So this one does wraps or bowls in various styles and wonchos (Wonton Nachos).  Consider me impressed.

Ordering is easy. Pick bowl or wrap then pick your protein (chicken, beef, carnitas, or portabello) and then pick your style (choices include Mediterranean, West Coast, Traditional, Dirty South, Mongolian, Caribbean, and Indian).

That's it. But as an extra consider getting one of the three styles of wonchos.  Trust me.  

I ordered the Mediterranean portabello for a friend and the Mongolian chicken for myself and we shared the Traditional wonchos.

All were amazing with great flavors but I especially enjoyed the wonchos which were better than nachos!  

Fast and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Don't care what you immediately think of when you hear the word \"wrap.\" This crew will redefine the stereotype! Creative, affordable, and fresh. Have them cater or drop in on their truck, you can't go wrong! Hoping they open a restaurant soon so I'm not always hunting them down/ stalking their Facebook/insta!!!!"}
{"text":"The Traditional bowl is my favorite! So delicious and fresh every time! Find this food truck before you think of going to Chipotle or Salsaritas! You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"Competing in the Charlotte Food Fight 2016, New Wrap Order had their usuals and then a special menu for the competition. My eye went right to the number one, the Deep South Bowl, a tasty combination of bacon pieces, chopped grilled chicken, chopped tomatoes and pimento cheese on top of a bed of lettuce. Quite tasty with the hot chicken melting the pimento cheese and the crunchy bacon, I enjoyed it tons. I'd have that one again!"}
