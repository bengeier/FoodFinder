{"text":"Decent pho place. A little skimpy on the meat (only about 3-4 beef balls in my large)."}
{"text":"Probably 3.5 stars but rounded up on account of being local. Ate in once, got take out once- food is significantly better eat-in but they aren't licensed (which annoys me-what's wrong with a beer with dinner??)  Large rare beef pho is $9, tasty with all the usual accompaniments (but not a lot of any). Table has a nice selection of sauces and chilies. Grilled pork on rice ($8) was yummy although a bit sweet for my liking. Vermicelli with spring rolls ($8) was average but fresh and nothing to complain about-spring rolls are a bit greasy and not huge but enjoyable.   Not the best Vietnamese in the city but certainly respectable and nice service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really happy that there is a restaurant that serves Pho in our area.  We ordered the fresh rolls, House Special Pho P01, and  Beef Pho P06.  The fresh rolls are great and comparable to anything I've had on Spadina.  The broth was really good with deep rich flavours - I sipped all the broth!  I ordered a large and there was a good amount of broth and not too much noodles.  I like to enjoy the broth especially on a cold winter day.  The decor is modern and the bowls, spoons, and utensils also fit with the place.  The server made sure to check up on us to see if we needed anything.   A more pleasant experience than your regular pho place.  I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"The pho is always tasty, the restaurant is clean, and staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. Nice clean space. Fast service. Space was a bit bright could use some better lighting."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, they truly know what they are doing when it comes to Pho and other popular Vietnamese dishes. For a long time, Golden Turtle was at the top of my list but now this place is. I highly recommend trying them - their pho is delicious, the restaurant is clean and the service is great. Great Restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho spot in Toronto. I have primarily eaten the pho but my peers who have tried other menu items rave about them as well. The pho has a really tasty broth - to the point that I struggle not to slurp it up even after finishing everything else and feeling full. Tables are stocked with all the necessary condiments like: chili oil, siracha (both types), hoisin, etc. Serve is solid and prices are reasonable. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many vietnamese restaurants and Pho Lang Van is one of the best. This is also a great place to try if you're new to Vietnamese food. Its a very enjoyable place to eat Pho or any kind of Vietnamese cuisine. If you are looking to find a nice tranquil place to eat I would recommend Pho Lang Van. The restaurant is very clean, modern and the food is very appetizing. The food is reasonably priced and the service is good."}
{"text":"Wow, I don't think I've ever been so appalled by horrible customer service.  They got my pickup order wrong, so I called them having already left. They placed me on hold and I could hear the girl who answered tell someone 'I don't know what order she's talking about' (when I picked up said order, there was only one couple seated and no other orders in sight; I even asked her 'this is C7, right?' to which she nodded).  Another girl then came on the line, snottily asking what I wanted when I had already politely explained that I thought the C7 was the pork chop and quiche with rice but had gotten mixed vegetables instead.  She sighed, ditzily explained, 'oh, she probably like misheard you or something like that'.  I replied that the online menu must have been wrong to which she responded 'she must have heard you say C12', halfheartedly apologises, and says 'bye' before promptly hanging up on me.  First off, in what universe does twelve sound like seven?  Secondly, I was trying to rectify an error but no attempt was even made in their part.  Who just hangs up on a paying customer after breezily admitting a mistake?  At no point did they offer to let me bring it back nor did I get a chance to suggest it.  Absolutely horrendous.  Oh and newsflash, when you have a dish containing hot liquid, maybe half-assedly closed styrofoam is not the way to go."}
{"text":"I've eaten Pho on at least three continents since discovering the dish as a teenager. I walked in to Pho Lang Van while I was waiting for my laundry next door and didn't have very high expectations.  The decor was modern and tasteful, but most importantly the food was great! Fresh, authentic ingredients and a wide selection of sauces available at each table to suit your tastes.  I had the Pho Tai Nam (rare beef with flank brisket) and it was among the best I've had.  I hope this business does well and I encourage you to try it."}
{"text":"Extra points for being a decent, new Vietnamese option in the neighbourhood instead of a breakfast joint or cheque cashing place / dollar store.    Clean, nice interior, friendly helpful staff, yummy food and good prices. We had the vermicelli and pho, enjoyed both and found portions quite generous. Lots of veggies with the noodles and sprouts etc with the Pho. Spring rolls were the only thing that seemed bland and not worth it. Looking forward to trying other menu items, hoping people in the neighbourhood get out and support them so they can stick around and not become yet another empty St Clair storefront."}
{"text":"All I can say is om nom nom. I'm at this place once a week and it's hard to pull away from ordering the rare beef pho because I love it so."}
{"text":"Great spot, so glad we tried it.  Will definitely be going back.  Pho was excellent (I had the chicken) and the service was great.  Also very clean.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very clean, modern, and fresh! Great pho - freshest broth I've ever had! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"it's passable.Of course there's much better pho in toronto, but if you live in the immediate area and it's freezing outside,  this would be an ok option."}
{"text":"Nice little Pho place on the corner of St Clair and Oakwood. Its new, very clean and kinda has very different decor than your usual Pho place. I found my broth a bit more bland than other places I've tried but it was very edible. I'd go back to try their vermeceli."}
{"text":"An average Toronto sized restaurant located near Dufferin and st Clair W. There are no private parking spaces. As for the interior, it is kept decently clean compared to many asian restaurants. I think they have recently renovated the space which looks clean. I originally came here for the phô and overall has an average flavour. The broth is much like many phô locations and they don't have the option between fresh or dry noodles. This location also did not have many people so the food came out relatively quickly. As for the server, he didn't say much nor did he come to check up on us to see if we needed any refills etc. This place is quiet and good for a quick meal."}
{"text":"This is a very very welcome addition to the neighbourhood. The place has a clean and comfortable vibe and the food is great. Really, can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"This is only a review for take out. I came here twice to get take out and was pleasantly surprised at how great everything tasted. I'm generally not a fan of getting pho take out, but there's something about this place that does it right.   The first time I came I ordered the Lang van pho and it was delicious! The noodles weren't over cooked and he broth was flavourful and clean. I even ate the tendon which I'm not a fan of, but it was perfectly cooked and buttery and didn't have chunks of fat stuck to it. I also ordered the shrimp fresh rolls and it was so good with the peanut sauce that they give you. I also tried some of my brothers Lang van dry noodle and it was sooo yummy!   The second time around I shared the grilled pork and grilled chicken on rice, shrimp fresh rolls and shrimp spring rolls with my husband. The fresh rolls were just as delicious as the first time, but the spring rolls were disappointing. They were really skinny and it seemed they had been cooked earlier in the day and sitting out. The chicken in the rice dish was delicious. It was juicy and flavourful, but sadly I would say the opposite of the pork. The pork was dried out and didn't taste that great.   My brother ordered the Lang van egg noodles with soup and I tried his broth. It was delicious! It was slightly sweet and scented with herbs. I loved it and wanted to drink it all.   I'll continue to get food from here as it's overall very delicious. I think it's just a hit or miss with some items."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Had grilled chicken and grilled pork on vermicelli, shrimp fresh rolls, and broken rice with beef and veg. We'd tried to order shrimp and Vietnamese sausage with veg to maker into rolls ourselves, but were told that they don't have the ingredients for those dishes and will be taking them off the menu.  Fresh rolls were ok. Vermicelli meat was very bland and the usual sauce didn't add much taste - most disappointing dish I've had in a while. Beef was ok.  Overall this was a disappointing meal and we won't be back again.  On the plus side it was clean and cool."}
{"text":"A well planned Phó place to visit in TO middle town.  They played music while displaying news in the Tv's, so you won't get bored even if you go by yourself. Although the service was taking it's time because there was only one person attending the tables, the waiter was attentive, kind, and accurate.  The decoration was trendy. Clean-shiny white everywhere, with different textures on the walls, green lucky plants, and an astonishing purple orchid.  There was all kind of customers; purple haired cool friends, ladies evening out, couples, families, and  some loners. I would go alone if the place was closer by.   I saw that some people went to pick some take outs.  Speaking about the phó, I enjoyed the tripe a lot because it was thin, perfectly cleaned and cooked; it gave a crunchy texture to the soup as a whole. Plus I eat everything; sometimes the weirdest is the better. The broth wasn't oily at all, it was aromatic, delicate and the perfect taste for such perfectly sliced meats... maybe they were cut with a samurai knife... The quality of the meat was evident as well.  I would definitely take friends and family to eat there."}
{"text":"Pho broth is balanced and tasty. Atmosphere is great. Iced coffee tasted like powdered mix, I prefer the traditional espresso with condensed milk.   The pho is definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Very excited to have a good Vietnamese place in the neighborhood. Have eaten here 4 or 5 times since it opened and the food has been delicious every time. Plus, it's nicely decorated and well priced unlike some of the dives downtown."}
{"text":"I have been going to many different pho places in the GTA and I must say this one has the best quality broth and meat   The prices are slightly higher but it's worth it to pay more and get something you want to eat all of.   I get the rare and well done beef every time.   This place is much better than the pho da bao chain."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from California craving pho. We hit this place up according to the reviews. We tried the pho tai and it was just like what you would get down in little saigon. The food was fresh and the service was outstanding. The owner came out and made sure everything was ok. Definitely a great place to eat it, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience today that would prevent me from returning.  I came here for pho tai and found a hair after I had finished 3/4 of the bowl. At first I assumed it was mine, but it was thick, short, dark, and kind of kinked whereas mine is very long, dirty blonde, thin and pencil straight. I know, shit happens, but I have food-related issues and it really ruined the meal for me.   I stopped eating immediately, signaled the server and discretely showed her the hair. She said that is our mistake, and walked away. After waiting a few minutes I walked up to the payment cash register. When she came over I asked if I could only pay for my drink. She said one minute and then had a conversation with her superior within my view. The superior walked over visibly frustrated and asked, \"What's the problem?\" (she clearly knew the problem).  I said can I please have the pho removed from the bill because there was a hair in it. She unhappily relented that she would give me half off since I ate most of it. I told her that I immediately stopped once I noticed the hair and the dish was contaminated. I told her I'd pay for the drink and handed her five dollars. She took the money and gave me change, all the while refusing to look at me or speak to me, and was visibly angry.  It's a shame because once I had got over the bad memory of the hair, I likely would have gone back since it's a rare pho place in the neighbourhood. I had been going every so often in the past month, and even brought a friend there earlier this week. But, based on her reaction, it's pretty clear that I wouldn't be welcome. Also, not cool to treat a customer that way when it's the restaurant's mistake."}
{"text":"We were around the area and saw this place with good reviews. And wowwww they were right, we got the cold  rolls with shrimp and they were super delicious, so soft and fresh, yummmmmm. We got the Pho Special, it was so good, the broth was so fragrant and tasty . And the best part of all, the washrooms were clean I will definatelly recommed this place and will come back"}
{"text":"I am very picky about my pho and am always apprehensive to try new places. I figured I would try it because it just opened and so close to my house! I was extremely happy with this restaurant. I ordered the rare beef pho and my boyfriend ordered the vermicelli with grilled chicken and veggies. Everything was delicious and fresh. I got extra veggies in my pho and it was amazing. This is my new spot for pho.. And so convenient!"}
{"text":"When your kid asks for pho, you pho find it!  Pho Lang Van is delicious.  We are well seasoned pho and bun eaters and my grilled chicken spring roll bun was fantastic.  My kid is slurping the rare beef pho next to me as I type this review.  Two thumbs up!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're craving pho but don't want to make the trip to Chinatown or uptown, this place is probably your best bet. Dishes taste fresh and flavourful and it's probably the cleanest pho restaurant you'll ever go to.   One thing to note: my boyfriend said that the well done beef was a little too tough so it might be better to go with rare. The vegetarian spring rolls were our favourite though and we enjoyed the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk as well; would highly recommend both of them!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese here. Guaranteed authentic food. The food is fresh and tastes very good. Nice proportion of meat/noodles or meat/rice (The Vietnamese steamed rice is also very good). The cleanest Pho place I've ever seen, even their washrooms smells good and clean.   The only down side is there is only 1 person who does both cashing and serving, which means she has to be at the counter almost all the time except for when she brings the dishes out, which makes it hard for us to reach her when we need anything."}
{"text":"Pretty darn decent day pho,  and it looks like they just opened. Cash and debit only BTW.  We stumbled on this place walking around that area,  and was super happy to see it,  the St Paddy/Bday hangovers was real and we needed some salty broth asap.    I had the pho special and the cold rolls,  which were made to order.  Loved how they also had chili oil on the tables,  such a pain asking for it some times.  Everything came out fresh and hot. Absolutely delicious! Well done and good luck with the new restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice medium sized restaurant. Had the chicken Pho, it was all white meat (which I like) and delicious. Group of 4 of us all enjoyed our Pho and rolls. The serve jasmine tea. Place is spotless with great service and food. I'll be returning regularly."}
{"text":"First time. Had the pho. Nice rich tasting broth. Decent service . its good pho. What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have tried plenty of pho restaurants, because it is our favorite! Pho Lang Van was comparable to the best pho we've had. The broth was very flavorful, and its definitely authentic! Not to mention.. SO reasonably priced. Service was fast and great, and we'll be visiting for lunch often."}
{"text":"Pho Lang Van has positioned itself as modern authentic Vietnamese food. It's interior is like no other pho restaurant I've ever been to before. It is bright, airy and has the feel of a modern chic coffee shop. But instead of big steaming mugs of coffee there are deliciously bowls of meaty goodness.   Decorations on the wall proudly proclaim that it's pronounced \"fuh\" and that they simmer their stock for 12 hours to get it just right. Even with this sort of advertising, I was really craving a \"bun\" or vermicelli bowl and opted for my old standby of grilled chicken and spring roll. I did take a gander at all the choices and was impressed with the variety of dishes. I could have even had raw pork on my vermicelli! (That will have to wait for a more adventurous day.) My bowl came with the usual accompaniments of cucumber, carrots, bean sprouts and shredded lettuce. The chicken was beautifully charred and the spring roll was crispy and hot. What made the dish stand out from all the others I've had was the fresh mint and the sautéed green onion, that really made the dish pop. The noodles were also thicker and denser than any other time I've had this dish. Maybe this is the way it's suppose to be? My dining companion also opted for non-pho as well and had tofu and vegetable stir fry on vermicelli. There was a nice assortment of veggies and the whole dish came with a dish soy based sauce.   I'm looking forward to having new food adventures at Pho Lang Van and having those old faithfuls like a 12 hour simmered pho."}
{"text":"From day one of their opening, the quality and service have been consistent. This is hands-down the best Pho in the city. Sometimes they don't have the bubble teas in stock that they advertise, but I wouldn't consider that a reason to dock a star considering how good the food is. Family owned, and they take a lot of pride in what they do. Happy to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wicked good pho right in the neighbourhood. Fantastic menu. Could eat here every day in the winter."}
{"text":"This place is very nice.  The pho is rich and flavorful.  The bun is nice and tasty.  They have a milkshake bar.  The decor is minimalist, but clean.  The best thing about this place is the price.  We often leave here after ordering 3 mains with a bill of under $35.  It's not all that easy to find a good Vietnamese restaurant in this neighborhood, but this is my new go-to-place."}
{"text":"My family and I are big lovers of some good Pho and we have been coming here for almost a year and a half. The food is always fresh and portions are great. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The only item on the menu that I would stray away from is their mango, avocado, shrimp tempura \"fresh\" rolls. The shrimp had a very unpleasant smell to it and I couldn't eat more than one bite, but like I said that is the only item I personally wouldn't buy again. Great pho every time."}
{"text":"Kids review: Pho broth was \"weird\" and affected the taste of the noodles. But everything else was good, especially the crispy pork spring rolls and lemonade.   Parents review: we really liked the broth, had a different flavor, very aromatic. Service was great and restaurant clean. They need to sort out the pigeon poop problem outside the main entrance, though."}
{"text":"The place is owned by Viet people but the food is not so good. I got the assorted regular size pho. The portion of the pho was a good size but it was lacking flavour and meat!! The meatball was so tiny and you only get one piece. The brisket was two tiny cracker size. Rare beef was dry.   The restaurant interior is really nice tho. Fast service and you pay at the counter."}
{"text":"Great and modern place for traditional phò.  They offer a all variants of phò and have an excellent beef stew.  The fruit shakes are also very good!"}
