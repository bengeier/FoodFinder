{"text":"I was there for a birthday party, and considering the size of the group the service was good.  I find the food to be very commercial and please do not order the duck confit salad.  It is a wilted grilled  heart of romaine (in one piece) with a piece of duck on it and a little bit of this questionable white sauce.  I was completely turned off and just ate the duck, which was OK but have had way better.  This should not be served as a salad dish. Thankfully I ordered the french onion soup as an entree.  It was comforting, very salty but acceptable.
I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So it's my first day as an Elite Yelper and I chose to forgo my homemade sandwich for something to bring my spirits up a notch.

I'd read good reviews about their pizza and I saw with mine very own eyes the magnificent chicken leg plates that wafted by deliciously but when a soul needs a boost you go with something special. I spotted their tartar section right away and the decision was made.

Not long after my order was placed, a beautifully plated beef tartar hovered onto my table. On the long breadboard a good sized mound of knife-cut tartar topped with a giant caper-berry was accompanied by a cute little french-fry basket of yummy little matchstick fries. Complementing this arrangement were tiny dipping bowls of ketchup and mayonnaise  in which you could dunk your 'frites'.  I was hoping for french mayo instead of the standard mayo that everybody serves but that wasn't to be. 

The tartar was toothsome and leaning toward delicate; the fries were childhood glee revisited. 

Overall: Nice presentation, good quality for price. It's not a four star place but then again, that's not what the majority of us are looking for when it comes to midday noshes."}
{"text":"This place had great interior design, but their cook should change profession immediately, I think food and service was the reason why the place immediately shut down!"}
{"text":"Please up date information, they are temporary closed until end of June.  But this is mid of July now. 
It feels bad I went there with door closed."}
{"text":"I was recently invited back to Frunchroom and I must say, my experience was much better. Firstly, the service was great. The waiter paid attention to detail and was present but not overbearing. Secondly, they finally have their signature items on their menu. Their deep dish pizza was great! 

It's nice to see that they have worked out their kinks and things are working much more smoothly now! Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Very cool and cozy place.  It's great for big groups and venue space.  I like the warm tones and 2 levels.  Food and drinks were good. Nice concept and cocktails."}
{"text":"Great decor, Awesome live band, good food (we had a pizza, salmon tartare and the duck ravioli). Will be back!"}
{"text":"An overall disappointing experience. Unwashed oysters full of sand and shells and horribly shucked, sat with empty drink glasses for over 30 mins, manager with a bad attitude - drinking beer with the DJ while we sat and waited for service - and poorly trained staff. The restaurant was completely empty and this should have been a warning sign of what was to come. I doubt this place will survive until Christmas. I wouldn't recommend going here at all."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to state that I did not eat here. 

I was interested in trying this place because of their claim of having a stuffed pizza. Being a Chicago native, I wanted to see if it stood up to a Chicago-style stuffed pizza. When I arrived, at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night, it was closed. There was a sign on the door stating they were having problems with the kitchen and that service should resume on June 30th. Today is September 13th!!!

Seriously, a note on Frunchroom's website, Facebook page or Twitter saying \"hey, we are closed until further notice\" would have been nice. Instead, I spent 30 minutes walking in a cold downpour just to find out they were closed. A little common courtesy, as well as a little common sense, goes a long way."}
{"text":"Not knowing that they essentially shut down from 3-5, I walked in alone at 3:30 to grab a bite/drink and kill time waiting for a friend in the area. As no one was around, I found myself asking the owner (Moe) if they were in fact open. So easily could he have shooed me away, but instead he welcomed me in. 

I had the burger, fries and a beer. Simple but classic. The burger was juicy and the non-ordinary bun/sauce really paired well with the onions and portobello mushrooms. Filling without being too heavy. This is the first restaurant I have seen that really nailed the shoe-string fries. Recent changes to the menu have added a lot of mouth watering plates, and had I had a significant appetite there would have been too much to chose from. Excited to return for happy hour martinis and live music.

Food is must try, and the great ownership / service are what keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Forget the critics, this place is awesome. Great drinks, delicious food, wonderful atmosphere, and all on a strip of René-Lévesque that was in dire need of some new life. 

If I could recommend one thing off of the menu, it would be the thin crust satjou (probably got that wrong), eggplant and goat cheese pizza. It's freaking unbelievable, and at only $13 for a full pizza, it's a steal! 

Oh, and the staff are some of the nicest I've encountered in months. Despite -20 weather in late March, they were as friendly and helpful as you could have asked for. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
