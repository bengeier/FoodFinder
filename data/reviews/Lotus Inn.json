{"text":"Had to drop this place to 3 stars... ordered the dinner for 1 meal with chicken balls, and they were they weren't as crispy because they packed it with the rice."}
{"text":"Just had Lotus Inn delivered. This restaurant should be listed as \"$$$\" with very little in terms of quantity.   Took a chance on the \"Buddha's Delight\" which, is far from what is advertised. Where are all the Asian mushrooms? You have to dig to find any. No noodles. $9.25!   Deep fried wontons usually have a little bit meat in them. Not here. Sauces are very generic. Chicken Soo Guy is OK.   Felt ripped off after spending $30 + tip.  Chinese is usually at least that much but you get containers full of food. I'll be heading to Buddha's Vegetarian ar Dundas & Bathurst next time I get a craving."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a culinary delight, or a new twist on Chinese food, than this is NOT for you. If you want fast, cheap and delicious Canadianized Chinese comfort food, you're going to love this restaurant. It's not the best food I've ever had (by far) but you get exactly what you order and for a fair price. Chicken balls were crispy, ginger beef was great, chow mein was... chow mein. I gave this place five stars because it's the best of its kind in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awful. Worst \"Chinese\" food ever.   Chicken ball batter was questionable.   Beef definitely tasted off.   Even the rice was bad. How do you screw up chicken fried rice?!"}
{"text":"Finally we found a Chinese food restaurant that both my hubby and I agree on. All the food was fresh and hot, and great tasting. We ordered the dumplings, the chicken balls fried rice and mixed vegetables. All was freaking fantastic. This is my go to place for west end eating!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried this restaurant shortly after it opened.  Let me start off by saying that the opinions expressed in this review similar to the opinions of my other family members.    We ordered the typical Westernized chinese food entres.  This included Hot and Sour Soup, Mango Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and a few others.  Rather then describe each dish separately, I can simply say when I go an eatery like this I tend to set my expectations on the low end of the scale and even those were not met.    I'm not too picky but really, how can fried rice be that difficult to make?  All of the dishes were a bit tasteless and seemed as though things were quickly rushed together.   The interior reeked of bleach which can be positive or negative depending on how you take that and the take out area  just wasn't that pleasant.    I understand that a new restaurant may have some issues to deal with however I have no plans to revisit anytime soon.    On the positive side of things, if you pick up your order, they do provide a 10% discount.    I am definitely open to the idea that this place will improve and maybe with another chef that will happen.  However this is one place that has been added to my \"keep driving and try another restaurant\" list.    On a side note; As I am a small business supporter, I would be more then happy to be contacted by the owner/ manger and share my entire experience or even try this place again with the assurance that things have changed for the better."}
{"text":"I rate my Chinese restaurants by the way they make their sweet & sour chicken balls.   I have to say, Lotus Inn has made the best ones I've had since I've moved to the Junction area.  And for that alone, I'll order from them again the next time I have a craving.  We ordered (over-the-phone delivery): sweet and sour chicken balls, breaded shrimp, chicken fried rice, shanghai thick noodles, vegetable lo mein, beef w/ black bean sauce and veg, spring & egg rolls.  Besides the chicken balls, I *really* enjoyed the beef w/ black bean, and the egg roll; the breaded shrimp and veg lo mein were good as well.  The fried rice kinda surprised me (in a weird sense).  Every other place I've ordered from the rice would come in an aluminum container; this time, it came in a medium sized Styrofoam cup.  Definitely less than what you'd get from the aluminum dish, and it was more expensive to begin with (by about 60 cents).  There was also a hint of an after taste from the chicken itself I think, but it wasn't bothersome.  The vegetable spring rolls were fairly large, probably the largest I've seen (well worth the price of $1.45), and was packed with the veg; what I didn't like was the spice used.  I've grown to enjoy certain spices, but when spring rolls come to mind, I think of them being more sweet then spicy.  For those who enjoy spice on just about everything though, you'll most likely enjoy these.  I didn't try the Shanghai noodles - that's the hubby's dish, but he seemed pretty happy with them.  Price wise, most of the dishes were 30 to 60 cents more expensive than other locations (save for Ho-Lee-Chow, 'cause that particular franchise wins hands down for expensive product pricing every time).  BUT from experience, I'd say that extra bit of change per dish is worth it for a better take-out experience then their local competitors.  And we received the lo mein for free (since our order was over $37 dollars).  So I think (after over ten years of searching) we've finally found our favourite Chinese take-out location!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Comfort food. Great onion pancakes. Awesome salty sides. Just straight up canadianized Chinese food of your youth. Perfect for a lazy Sunday, post drinks over the paper. I liked their pork buns. Love their soups. And delivery was super fast."}
{"text":"I ordered from Lotus Inn two nights ago and it was really good.  I especially enjoyed the shrimp fried rice. On the flip side, I thought the crab rangoon was overpriced and undersized. Overall, I thought it was a good meal and the sauces were delicious so I even ordered it again the following night.  Little did I know that Lotus Inn was about to embarass me infront of a friend and BOTH my cats.    First of all there was a long black hair tightly installed in my spring roll. (see video) http://instagram.com/p/wsJiG4isvw/?modal=true  Second of all, there's something strange about that chicken. I hope someone out there has the courage to rise up and reveal what animal this is.  It tasted like a wallabee or a male platypus. Could have been badger meat as well..  If I'm certain of one meat, it's chicken..and trust me that was NOT chicken!   Don't get the general jor (thats the name, its their remix of the general tao) cuz my cats sniffed a piece, paused then walked the fudge out the room.  At least we know it's not mouse meat.   Horrified.  2 stars."}
{"text":"Never once got my order right and trying to make it right, they want charge me delivery again . Food all greasy , not very good and small portions"}
{"text":"Never, ever order here on New Year's day!  We placed our order online and it said the food would be ready for pickup in 30 minutes. Arrived to a place full of people who had been waiting a VERY long time for food. My husband waited an hour and 25 minutes for the food to come out. People were surprisingly calm, though very frustrated, but the woman working the cash was beyond RUDE. My husband had to tell her to stop calling him honey when he asked about our food order. Without getting into insults, she was a disaster and an embarrassment to the place...   In the end, the food was ok - nothing spectacular, but definitely not worth the wait.  The hunt continues for decent Chinese food in the west end."}
{"text":"About halfway through my perfectly mediocre meal from Lotus Inn, I remarked to my dining companion that I wished it wasn't so difficult to find actual, authentic Chinese food in the Yonge/Eglinton area.  We were looking to order something than our usual Thai for dinner and I figured the time was right to give Lotus Inn a shot. A quick perusal of their fairly extensive menu led us to the following three items:  Lotus Special Spring Roll: This was probably the highlight of the meal, oddly enough. I'm not sure what was in this thing, but it tasted fresh and the ingredients all worked well together.  Szechuan Beef: Though this was edible, it was shockingly tasteless. The dish, which contains an impressive amount of beef and vegetables, is almost entirely lacking in the bold flavors one associates with Szechuan cuisine. And spiciness? Forget about it.  Sweet and Sour Pork (Cantonese Style): This was exactly what you'd assume, in that it's a whole mess of fried piece of pork (and veggies) swimming in an almost sickly sweet sauce. I won't lie, I did enjoy this. It reminded me a lot of the Chinese food I'd get when I was a little kid. But in terms of offering anything complex or interesting, I wouldn't say this dish succeeded.  Lotus Inn's offerings are cheap, at least. All that food, plus the tip for the delivery person, came out to about $35."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Overpriced, not much flavour and over cooked. Too much breading on the meat, and sweet and sour items come with the sauce drenched over the food. Makes it soggy breading"}
{"text":"Lotus inn has a great dim sum menu  I always order a combination platter which has different kinds of Chinese pierogies, sticky rice, shrimp rolls, minced vegetables it's definitely really tasty.  I always go for the dim sum as it is fresh amazing tasting and when you order from Lotus inn there always on time.  I have stayed away from other dishes on their menu as their fried rice I did order once and it was not the best. Their American/Canadian Chinese is basically chicken balls covered in candy not my thing but some people like it"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here via Skip The Dishes & were very pleased. The spring roll was a standout, full of fresh ingredients and good texture to the roll wrapper, best I've had so far. I really loved their egg drop mushroom soup, which not enough places do very well IMO. Lots of whole juicy mushrooms, a nicely flavoured not too salty broth. I was quite happy with their appetizers sampler too, especially the battered shrimps and chewy spareribs. My daughter says their pork fried rice was great and she liked their chicken balls. Lotus Inn is now added to our list of places with good fresh quality takeout with reasonable prices. We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Lotus Inn is a tiny takeout/delivery only restaurant in The Junction that serves up super tasty Chinese food. Their crispy Lemon Chicken and General Jors (a version of General Tso) Chicken are unmatched in taste. They also have really good vegetarian options like spicy deep fried tofu and curry tofu. You can request no MSG if you like.  Make sure you ask what your total is because for some reason they never automatically tell you and then it's a surprise when they come to your door! Quick delivery."}
