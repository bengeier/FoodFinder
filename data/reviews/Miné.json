{"text":"I went to Miné for lunch and it was great - the food is fresh and really good. You have a variety of sushi combination as well as Korean dishes. 
The prices are reasonable and the owners (I think they are Koreans) and their staff are really nice and friendly

I´ll defiitely come back and recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Petit resto pas mal, sans toutefois être extraordinaire en ce qui concerne les sushis en combo. Les prix sont raisonnables surtout dans le quartier dans lequel il est situé."}
{"text":"I've always avoided this place and never known why. Finally decided to try out their sushi and it was just sad. Better than grocery sushi but still just meh.

It's really sad too because the service is great and so is the restaurant layout. 

I do want to try more of their menu so I will be back and see if the rating changes."}
