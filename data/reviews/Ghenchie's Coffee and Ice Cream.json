{"text":"Great coffee: I'll admit, I'm very picky about coffee. I have my own espresso machine at home. I wandered into this lovely little shop, and it reminded me very much of being in Italy. I just wanted a single shot espresso, and my expectations were low, since even the most hipster, well-visited coffee shops in the US have served me with the most abysmal, bitter espresso. But I was intrigued by the walls lined with bricks of Lavazza coffee - my favorite brand. The lady who served me was very nice, and I will say that this was, hands-down, the BEST espresso I've had in the United States. I'm very pleased!"}
{"text":"This is now JAVA House, not Ghenchies.  And I like it even more than before!  Classy, friendly."}
{"text":"Very cool little shop in the heart of Gastonia!  Great atmosphere and ice cream (didn't try the coffee yet). Service was friendly and the restrooms were clean (this is one of the indicators that most people overlook, you can tell a lot about the business as to how they keep up their restrooms!). Highly recommend stopping by when you are in downtown Gastonia!"}
{"text":"I did not purchase anything, but I definitely can vouch for the previous comments and ratings before me about the owner. He is a wonderful, kind, and loving personality. As I was peaking inside from outside the large glass windows, he greeted me and showed me around the place. I will be back to try some of the ice cream over a weekend trip with friends for sure!

Glad Gastonia is slowly growing into a city worth walking the sidewalks for an evening out or a mid-day stroll."}
{"text":"This small little coffee shop in the heart of G-Town is an absolute must see. I have been here several times and it has become my favorite spot in the city! I love the Cafe Affogato with a scoop of fudge ripple. The setting is very homey. The brick walls and comfortable seating gives the environment a welcoming feel. I love this little spot and I hope GHENCIES is here to stay!"}
{"text":"The manager was closing everything down as we walked in but he welcomed us in warmly! He then proceeded to make my husband and I the best vanilla latte's we've ever had. I highly recommend!! Nice outdoor sitting area as well!"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience down the road at Life of Pie and I am so relieved that our food experience in Gastonia wasn't a complete waste. I had the best ice cream combo ever...coffee cookies and cream! My husband had the butter pecan and coconut chocolate chip and they were amazing as well. So glad we stopped here before leaving."}
{"text":"They get five stars just for greeting me warmly and enthusiastically when I walked through the door. That is the first thing I look for in a business. Do you actually want me as your customer? Then act like it. Adina greeted me and was super friendly. I like this spot. They have all of your typical coffees - regular and flavored. They also have ice cream. Adina told me that they are going to be expanding and will begin offering breakfast and lunch. They will include wraps and salads made with organic ingredients. I'm excited about that and will definitely return to take advantage."}
