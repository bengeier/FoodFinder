{"text":"Great meal...wish I cold give more stars.  Get the tasting menu, makes it easier and is a great mix of food!  Can't miss place!"}
{"text":"Decent Middle Eastern food. Don't believe the hype. There are many restaurants in Montreal that are just as good but at a much lower cost. Service is lacking."}
{"text":"Tried Damas based on Yelp reviews. The decor was clean, bright, and had a very good atmosphere. We sat at the bar by the kitchen so we had full view of the salad station and coal grill. The food was amazing and the service was wonderful. Our waiter was really nice and friendly, he made very good recommendations and took time to explain each dish to us

Octopus Salad (5/5):
Amazing flavours and texture combined into a salad. The octopus was perfectly grilled so that the flavours and texture was perfect in combination with the salad. Definitely would come back to the restaurant just for this salad.

Kabab Halali (Lamb Kabab) with Baba Ghannouj (4.5/5):
Very flavourful lamb kababs, the lamb was very well seasoned, good portions.  The side of baba ghannouj was very good (this can be ordered on its own as a salad), the dish was perfectly seasoned and the eggplant mix had a nice smokey flavour. 

Overall:
Food: amazing flavours, great textures, coal grill is a plus
Service: very good, explained dishes and components when it was served, consistent water refills 
Decor: very clean, good atmosphere, inviting"}
{"text":"Upscale meditarean food. Relaxed vibe. Great service. 

Food was great. Seafood and meat was cooked well. All protein was tender and imbibed with grilled flavor. 

Service was excellent. Our server Daniel took the time to explain the menu and went out of his way to make us feel welcome and was attentive to us all night. 

Decor is rich and upscale but there wasn't any pretension."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in montreal. Fatoush salad was incredible. Fattet makdous was out of this world.  Went to a bunch of other restaurants in Montreal, this was the best."}
{"text":"By far the best middleseastern food I have had that is presented in a very modern and fine style. The service is excellent. The bread is warm and fresh. We tried 5 different dishes and all received a 5 star rating: the eggplant muttabal, fattoush, shish tawook, lsanat, and the kebob with cherry.

Would defintitlely come back everytime we are in town."}
{"text":"Overall a fantastic restaurant if you are looking for a Syrian or middle eastern dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome meal- waited on by Vito who was awesome. Never had Syrian food before-absolutely delicious with superb service!"}
{"text":"Really one of the best meals that I've ever had. Everything was spectacular from start to finish. The fattoush is not to be missed. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would most definitely go back again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Un de mes meilleurs retstaurants à Montréal! Tout est succulent! Un petit faible pour les plats avec l'agneau qui FOND en bouche! Cuisine authentique avec des plats populaires rendus gastronomiques... C'est cher mais ça vaut la peine!"}
{"text":"We went this Saturday to DAMAS to try the new location. The decor is great , the food is tasty as usual. The service  is fantastic. This is one of the best restaurant in Montreal ... You will not be disappointed .."}
{"text":"I think it's safe to assume that most people who go here have not had Syrian food before, and it will likely be a while before they find it again. Yet the lingering memories of Damas will surely resonate for some time... exceptional flavors and presentation across the menu. We savored every bite of every dish. (If you have someone in your party who doesn't like lamb though, you're going to have to get a little creative with the menu.) It's a good indication that the only reservations we could get were for 10pm and the place was packed even then."}
{"text":"Well I must say I haven't been this impressed with a dining experience in a long time! From the service to the mouth-watering plates, this restaurant will soon become your go-to place in Montreal. 

Ambiance: Intimate, gorgeous decor, soft lighting, pleasant music in the background which isn't too overpowering and allows for conversation.

Service: Excellent! Water glasses always filled up, fast service, staff is courteous and efficient.

Food: Decadent and savory. The perfect spice combination, meats were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The star of the show was the Fattet Mozat hands down - LITERALLY falls off the bone. A word of caution, if you order the Mixed Grilled Platter for 2, be advised it really is more for 3. We were surprised at how much food came on this platter! Great choice nonetheless. Everything else was superb, even the homemade pita bread! Hummus, Eggplant Mutabbal and Fattouch salad are perfect starters (that salad had at least 10+ ingredients). Regardless of what you decide to order, you will not be disappointed. 

5 stars Damas, bravo!"}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant, incredible food. 
I've been to most restaurants in Montreal, and all around the world for that matter- and this can be one of the best meals I have ever had. Strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had. I went with my family for NYE and we got the NYE menu which consisted of the tasting menu and a few additional dishes. The food was just amazing. Cooked perfectly, flavorful and plated beautifully. What made our night even better was the excellent service, especially our amazing waiter, Alec! Run, don't walk to this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What a treat. High quality ingredients with good portion sizes. If you aren't a lamb fan be sure to try the game hen. Complex, flavourful dishes that won't let you down."}
{"text":"This should be pretty straight-forward. Simply put, this was among the best meals I have ever had in my life. We had the tasting menu for $75 pp, which I strongly recommend. Everything we had was fantastic.

We sat at the bar, and our waiter/bartender, Isham, was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the food. He took the time to explain each course we were given, including the ingredients and how it was prepared.

Definitely go, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of Montreal's best restaurants, you get what you pay for, my husband wanted to surprise me and it was my first time here, I must admit was impressed.
I would recommend the fish plate samkeh harra (bass fish with lots of flavours) and also the macloubeh (fried eggplant with chicken and rice), fatuoush (a type of salad with crispy pita) was fresh and just right, just don't overfill yourself with appartizers because you might not have enough room for main meal and you will end up packing the rest haha
I would come again Damas, amazing place!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Damas...amazing authentic Aleppo Syrian food...the meat is always delicious and of the highest quality...their knafeh is the best I ever tasted...I love their new spacious dining room..a bit on the pricy side but well worth it."}
{"text":"We got the tasting menu for two.
2 tasking menus + 2 drinks each + Tax + Tip = $250. 
I would say maybe 4.5 stars - for that price I need to be completely blown away by every item.

1) Cold mezze are delicious. Perhaps if I go back I would actually skip these because they are good but extremely expensive compared to everywhere else and very filling

2) Shrimp and octopus were GOOD but not amazing. 

3) Veal and Lamb were outstanding.

In total I would say I enjoyed this meal tremendously but its not a 5/5 since a few dishes were good but not eart-shattering and the price was huge. 

Would still go back but would avoid the tasting menu and skip straight to a single main

Great service, nice dining room, good drink selection."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We ordered 6 different dishes and every single one had such amazing and unique flavor. If you are in Montreal and have not tried this restaurant you have no idea what you are missing. Bravo well done!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to eat at Damas Restaurant and it did not disappoint! We ordered the Tasting Menu to try a variety of different dishes.
1) Beef tartare (Kibbé nayyé) 7.5/10-Good start, fresh ingredients, nice balance in texture with the crunchy nuts and soft, tender beef tartare
2)Fattouch 8.5/10- Very refreshing salad with a variety of fresh vegetables, herbs, spices. Really enjoyed the crunchy texture on each bite and the acidity from the dressing. 
3) Sea bass? 9/10-This was delicious! The skin was really crispy, and the fish meat was very soft and moist. The sauce was not overpowering and complimented the fish perfectly
4) Grilled octopus 8.5/10- perfectly grilled octopus on top of tomato, caper and chickpeas sauce. Very nice balance in flavors! 
5) Eggplant, Beet Mutabbal, humus lahmé 8/10- The eggplant mutabbal had a great smokey flavor, the beet one was very creamy and even had a nice sweetness to it. The lamb was tender and juicy. All three dishes were amazing when dipped with pita!
6) Fattet Mozat 10/10- This was my favorite! The lamb was so tender and juicy and it came off the bone so easily. This mixed with rice, nuts and yogurt sauce created the perfect combination of rich flavor and creamy texture
7) Rack of lamb 7/10- Nice tender lamb with delicious creamy sauce. 
8) Dessert 7.5/10: By this point, we were stuffed and forgot what the exact name of the desserts were! The desserts were very sweet and fulfilling. I especially liked the ice cream one with the crunchy pastry on the bottom. The other one was almost like a cream cheese filled mochi! 
Overall Damas was a great experience and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were referred here by our Syrian Uber driver and the food was great!! Even my vegetarian daughter was able to find quite a few great dishes. The cocktails were good and we sat at bar so we had great view of the place.  Good music, the beet hummus was fab and the lentil vegetable dish was like nothing I've tasted before!  If you eat lamb you must go! They had quite a variety of dishes. Would have given it 5 stars but our server was really slow."}
{"text":"Did not want to go to damas as I thought it was just another Mediterranean Greek/Turkish style restaurant. Was I wrong! I was blown away! Flavors are beyond belief! OMG!!!! Delicious is an understatement! Did not know what to order as I don't eat meat or she'll fish. The waiter suggested (actually convinced me) To get the fatoosh salad (mind blowing!) had the 4 spreads appetizer and the fish for enter. I was stuffed after the fatoosh salad but could not stop eating. Could not stop thinking about the food for the remainder of my trip, and would have returned but promised myself not to repeat any restaurants and try new ones. I should have come back. I will now try all Syrian/Lebanese restaurants in NYC, that's how much Damas blew me away! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Great atmosphere, food is top notch. Had the fatoush salad, warm octopus and chickpea salad and the lamb in yogurt sauce. Unbelievable flavours. Everyone having the tasting menu looked super happy. Service was attentive and warm (thank you Rose). Highly recommend. A Montreal gem."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the best restaurants in Canada! What a gem. The food is exceptional and so is the service. My party of four ordered the 5-course traditional Syrian menu and every bite was a treat. A special note to the restaurant for serving authentic fattoush and succulent, spiced lamb. We will be back when we are in the area. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Loved the food.. the service and the decor. .tried their fattoush it was great! Makloba..fatta. .even the grilled cheese was wonderful.. would definitely be back for it.."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Syrian food with a modern twist. I loved all dishes, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic, simply one of the best meals you can ask for. 

Flavor, spices, portions , ambience, combinations of food is genius.

Great service as well. 

We opted for the sampling menu 75$ per person 
It's like middle eastern / syrian tapas but generous portions 
It's clearly influenced by the Aleppo kitchen which is one of best cuisines in the Middle East. 

Every plate was better than one before ,  great presentation , great food combinations , AMAZING taste , and very filling. 
 
After you Gazillion course delicious AUTHENTIC meal , you get coffee or traditional tea , then heavenly dessert.  

Hands down best restaurant in Montreal , should get their Michelin stars for sure very soon."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal with fantastic atmosphere and such flavours and spices. The server was great but the food was most definitely the star of the show. We shared the tasting menu that brought me back to my college days in the Mid-East. I can't wait to return to have the mixed grill."}
{"text":"Incredible!!! The absolute best Syrian cuisine, you will ever experience!... Probably in All of Canada!!"}
{"text":"First time eating Syrian. Loved the ambiance and service. But the ultimate is the food and presentation. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is absolutely amazing, not to mention how great the service is. The fattoush, hummus, and sumac fries were the best I've ever had! For the entrees, I would definitely recommend the Kebab d'Alep. Should I come to Montreal again, I would definitely make sure to come back here."}
{"text":"Ive read about Damas before, in many articles and it seems to be the top 10 of places to eat. by far the food was amazing, worth a visit. however, the service was just terrible. very slow, even though there were empty tables, and food comes out very slowly. 

The lentil soup was filling, and had such a great kick to it. at first it didnt seem spicy, but the spice and heat built up and it felt great in the back of my throat. i loved the touch of crunchiness that was in it. not to mention, it was a decent size. i ended up trying to the 4 meze dips as an entree, and was not let down. all 4 dips were truly the perfect texture, flavour, and size--although they put me into a coma. the beet dip was the most unique one, and id say my favorite. never had a sweet, mediterrean dip before. the pepper and nut dip was my second flavorite, it was thick but the crunch of the nuts is what i loved the most. my third favorite was the eggplant one, eggplant flavor was intense but also had a crunch and sweet and sour touch to it with the help of the pomergrante seeds thrown in it. what a nice flair! lastly, the the hummus. lets be honest here, the hummus dip was great, but compared to the other 3 this one didnt stand a chance."}
{"text":"Very good!  Stumbled upon this while looking for food in the city and was not disappointed.  The floor manager was very friendly and the service was all around good.  The dishes were unique spins on classic middle eastern food and it was delicious!  The fattoush and babaganoush are a MUST.  The mixed grill for two gave me a good variety of meat and seasonings.  Not overly complex.  Seasoned just well enough to enhance the natural flavor of the meat.  Amazing.  The chicken dish we received (forget the name but I know it means upside-down in the chef's native language) was also delicious.  The nuts and raisins in the rice sealed the deal.  Drinks were a little pretentious but the hibiscus sipper was nice.  For some reason there's pomegranate seeds on almost everything.  Not a complaint just interesting."}
{"text":"We had the tasting menu and it was a feast, we spent the next day biking to burn all the calories. 

Everything was delicious; flavourful and delicately spiced. It was an effort afterwards to try to pick a favourite, but the kibbe nayye was a contender. 

Often with a tasting menu, the dessert is an afterthought and not really worth it; so we were pleasantly surprised that the kunefa (?) a sweet cheese pastry was so good. 

Our host was second generation Syrian and was a delight, his wit and explanations added greatly to our enjoyment of the evening. Would heartily recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful tasting menu. Waitress helped us select a wine that would work with the tasting menu. Highlights of the tasting were the first two flights. One was a sort of deconstructed pita with thinly sliced beef a quail egg some house sauce and tomatoes. Sort of felt like a gyro pita, but way better and without all the mess of a gyro. That was probably a lame way to describe it, but it was really good. The second flight had pita straight from an oven and various dips. The beet dip and the red pepper dip were amazing. The beet dip didn't have any peanut butter in it, but it hit such a similar taste range when it hit your tongue. It definitely wasn't peanut butter, I just have never had anything like it and that's the closest comparison that came to mind. It definitely was a beet dip. The red pepper dip had a sort of chili (like the soup) flavor to it. The rest of the servings of food were all really nice. The lamb and chicken were all well cooked. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Montreal, the food was exceptional (amazing lamb, beef, sauces, octopus, Dios and breads) is so tasty, beautiful presentation, wonderful atmosphere, service can't be better. Had the tasting menu and I can't even describe the deliciousness of the food...you have to try it at least once on your life, you won't regret it! Can't wait to be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food - incredible flavours, Great service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves better than 5 stars.   Most friendly and attentive service by staff. Exquisite food I've had middle eastern food most of my life but I've never had one this good.  My hat's off to the chef.  I wouldn't mind flying from LA to have this food again."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based on the recommendation from our hotel concierge. Happily, we were able to enjoy some excellent high-end Middle Eastern dishes. The service was top-notch, the food presentation was both artistic and very tasty. We highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had heard about Damas for a long time before finally going there, so I had great expectations, but wasn't at all disappointed. The starters in particular were spectacular. The humus lahmé was incredible and the baba ghannouj salad was even better, an explosion of flavours. I'm looking forward to dining there again to give the tasting menu a try! The place is beautiful, and the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"We had the  tasting menu and it was FANTASTIC! For $75 we were able to try a bit of everything.  The service was top notch, the decor was beautiful. I'm Lebanese so I know what good middle eastern food tastes like and this was some of the best I've ever had. We added something to the tasting menu and they didn't even charge us. Alan was our waiter and he was so pleasant and helpful. We loved every moment and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Je voulais rajouter une étoile mais je me rend compte que j'avais déjà mis 5 la dernière fois... Déception. 

Damas m'a offert un de mes meilleurs souvenirs culinaires à ce jour : un houmous de chanterelles poêlées avec des pignons de pins. Un DE-LI-CE! 
Un repas de Noël d'entreprise parfait, un service soigné et drôle, des mets parfumés et du bon vin pour les accompagner. Que demander de plus?"}
{"text":"Excellent. Definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to! We scored a seat at the bar and ordered fattouche, ackawi cheese, mouhammara, muttabel with eggplant, and kabbab d'Alep. The flavors of each were incredible. The staff at the bar were also great - wonderful service and super friendly. Also, try the cocktails! Those were also amazing. It's a 10 min cab ride from downtown, but well worth it. We were visiting from Chicago and wanted to try this place."}
{"text":"This shit is the bomb. Decor, food, and service is awesome! Definitely stands out as one of the best dining experiences in Montreal. Deserves every star of this review."}
{"text":"My time in Montreal was limited, and we had time for one fine dining experience. After thorough research on yelp, I decided on Damas and was not disappointed. Montreal is known for its diverse population & I was very impressed with its Syrian cuisine at Damas. The interior was beautiful, but not stuffy. It was a great place to enjoy a family meal and perfect for foodies. Since we had an adult who does not eat that much we decided to a la carte. We ordered the four mezzo spread and added the labneh. Each spread was perfect.

We also got the octopus and it also tasted amazing. I could have eaten the whole platter myself.

We also had the Fattet Makdous 39 (Eggplant stuffed with lamb and nuts, tomato sauce, pita, yogurt and tahini sauce). That was probably the best value for quality. The dish was amazing. It reminded me of a blend between lasagna and moussaka. 

We finished with the Syrian sea bass which was pan fried to perfection.

The service was 5 stars. Our waiter was very pleasant and helpful. The interior is also super cozy. 

The restaurant is in a cute residential neighborhood in Outremand, and I would not have expected such a delicious restaurant. 

I would only say that when they changed our cutlery, it felt like it was just being thrown down on the table without any proper order. 

Definitely make reservations. It is a very busy place, but the restaurant surprisingly has good sound insulation so it isn't too noisy to have conversations. There are different books in the restaurant, and if you have a larger group, perhaps request a window round table.

I love this place! Would definitely go back to try their tasting menu."}
{"text":"Really delicious Syrian food. We had the tasting menu. You get hummus, a delicious beet dip (my fav) and a great salad. Then course after course of delicious flavors. Grilled octopus, spicy shrimp, a scrumptious veal mignon"}
{"text":"Had the chefs choice and it was simply amazing. Not only that but I was fullllll to the brim. Very good value. Also their drinks are so unique and wonderful. Highly recommend for special occasions."}
{"text":"The food is super delicious, it's a true demonstration of one of the richest and oldest cuisine in the world , the Syrian cuisine (which is the mother of the Lebanese, Palestinians ,and Jordanian cuisines )is only comparable to the Moroccan cuisine when the Middle East culinary art is concerned . while the Moroccan achieved enormous success in spreading globally, the Syrians were more conservative in showcasing their culinary treasure. The restaurant Damas Montreal does it at its best, the service is friendly, although it could be more knowledgeable and the ambiance is nice and the bar cocktails are really good. The only downfall in my opinion are the small quantities which don't represent the Syrian hospitality , for the prices that they are charging they are expected to be more generous with the food, hope the chef owner will one day take a notice of this repeated criticism , otherwise the restaurant has really earned its position on the top of Montreal's best restaurants."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu and excellent service. One minor snag was that our waiter kept pushing us to order alcohol and my dinner companion (a recovering alcoholic) was visibly uncomfortable. The price was a little on the steep side but the menu was clearly made lovingly. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo amazing. Decor, food, service were all spot on. We had the Beet Mutabbal in which my boyfriend was skeptical about but ended up enjoying the most! We also had the Fattet Mozat and hummus which we devoured in minutes. The best part about this place though is that they bring you a baby pita fresh and hot out of the oven EVERY TIME. I think we had 10 each since they were so amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at this restaurant! I've tried Kaza-Maza, Alep, and the short-lived Syrian restaurant on Mont-Royal, and this is the best, by far - mind you, all these Syrian restaurants are excellent, but Damas is really one step above the rest. The new location's ambience is also much warmer than the previous one. You cannot go wrong with this one."}
{"text":"Best fattoush salad that I have ever tasted! 

We ate an early dinner on the patio. Fattoush and the meze platter (4 dips) were delicious. They bring amazing hot pita breads for you. Main dishes are pricey but flavourful. Great waitstaff. Worth it for a nice dinner splurge!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?? This is by far the best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever been to... and I've been to a lot!

The food doesn't get any better but more importantly, the service was impeccable!  I would almost fly back to Montreal just for this place... 

This place is a MUST"}
{"text":"Damas serves very very good food and I wish they'd serve more of it. Ever been to a fancy resto and fill up on bread because of the excellent yet small portions? This is just what might end up happening here. Anyway, aside from the skimpy portions, everything was great. Complimentary green and black olives are served immediately. The bread is freshly made and brought steaming hot to your plate at your request. This is really really good bread. The fatouche is very good and is probably one of the only items to come in a larger portion. The labneh with zaatar is delectable as well. The humous is just right. The falafel was the least noteworthy feature. The desserts here are unbelievably rich and indulgent. Rose water, pistachio and homemade cheese make for a taste explosion in my mouth coupled with a beautiful cup of sweet tea. The cocktails are creative as well. There was a rose inspired mojito and a vodka drink with dried apricots and pistachio. 

Damas offers a beautiful arabesque ambiance with warm lighting and delicious food. There is a sultry red fabric above with golden Arabic calligraphy. Damas refers to one of the old names of the City of Damascus. The walls are lined with intricate wooden screens. There is a choice selection of fine wines in plain view. Lanterns cast a seductive glow.

Come here for a special occasion. If you want just as excellent quality but wanna skip the pricy ambiance then ... for excellent bread and labneh and zaatar and fuhl go to Al-Baghdadi on Lincoln in Concordia. For falafel go to Nilufar on Sainte-Catherine. For humus go to Art Brgr in the Plateau."}
{"text":"The salad was an explosion of wonderful flavours in my mouth. I felt like i was tasting food from the heavens. But the best was the eggplant meal. It was simply legendary..."}
{"text":"I travelled all over the middle east, ate at what i believed were the best ME restaurant but then discovered Damas restaurant in Montreal.  This place is amazing a delight classy good amazing priceless outstanding.
If you want to have a true Middle eastern cuisine experience, this is the place."}
{"text":"Location: Park Ex, on Van Horn. The easiest way to get here is to drive or take a cab. Street parking is available but metered on the main street, so check their hours of operation. You can probably find parking on the side streets - just make sure they're not zoned. 

The place: Quite lovely, actually. The decor is warm and inviting and, I'd say, representative of traditional Syrian decor. Now, bear in mind that I haven't been to Syria so perhaps my imagination needs a reboot.  The point is, I like it and for a few hours I felt like I was away from the city. 

The goods: My date and I decided to share an order of the dumplings, Kibbe and the eggplant salad. The dumplings were delicious and of a good size. Very flavorful and there was enough yogurt sauce to go around and then some. We also enjoyed the kibbe and were satisfied with the two that we ordered (1 each). I'd say that if you go with the dumplings, you should consider one other mezze - three might be a bit much if you plan to order a main. I personally hate eggplant, but I tried the salad. My date enjoyed it very much, but there was this taste that I can't describe, that really put me off. Sort of a bitter, smoky taste. Oh, I had the Pommegrenade Cobbler and my date had the Hibiscus cocktail - both were delicious.

In terms of mains, I was considering going for the sea bass because it looked fantastic, but the $64 price tag put me off. That, and the waiter told me that it was a 2 pound fish - a 2 pound fish, all for me. Soooooo I ordered the Shish Taouk and so did my date. I can honestly say that neither one of us was disappointed. It was DELICIOUS. The portion was quite big if I compare it to say, Greek or Lebanese chicken sticks; the large chunks of chicken were moist and bursting with flavor. The potatoes were perfect and the cherry tomatoes and pickled veggies completed the dish (watch out for those little green balls though - that sh*t is SPICY!). All this to say that every dish we ordered was perfectly seasoned and tasty.

For dessert, my date had the Baklava ice cream and I went with the... I can't remember what it was called, but it had ricotta cheese and pistachios, and was nicely rolled up like a spring roll. It was pretty fabulous. 

Service: Great. Everyone was attentive, our water glasses were always full, and someone was always checking to see how we were doing. 

Price point: This is where I docked a star. It cost us $200 for two people (we each had one drink), which is steep. For example, the dumpling entrée was $22 for three dumplings, which, in my opinion, is expensive. If I recall, the Shish Taouk was $30, which is again, steep. While I absolutely agree that the food is delicious, I think the prices could be adjusted slightly. In any case, it's a great place for a special occasion and worth checking out."}
{"text":"What an experience!

We had the tasting menu and it worth every penny.

Every dish was no, everything on the plate was perfectly season and combine. By this, I mean, that on a plate you had different item like a sauce, a vegetable, a meat etc. That is season to shine and support the rest of the plate.

We had 7 of those. What a delight!

I also salute the service that is impeccable."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience! I'm visiting Montreal on vacation and this has been my favorite meal that we've had. Syrian food is not a cuisine I'm very familiar with, as is not common back where I call home. We opted for the tasting menu to get the full experience ($85 CAD per person, 2 person minimum, 12-15 small shared plates) and it was stellar! Every dish they brought out was perfect, unique and had the most amazing flavors and unlike most tasting menus, we left feeling so full...we could not even eat all the food they brought us. The restaurant is also gorgeous and the service was top notch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Aucun commentaire négatif sur ce restaurant. Sa réputation est tout à fait justifiée. Nous avons eu droit à un service sans faute et les plats que nous avons choisis étaient vraiment savoureux. Comme entrée, les mezzes froids à partager sont un excellent choix. Le muttabal d'aubergine vaut le détour à lui seul. Comme plat, le jarret d'agneau braisé se défait tout seul et déborde de saveur. Nous y retournerons assurément!"}
{"text":"Been there only one time with several friends.  We ordered the chef special, which means he cooked whatever he felt like.  Food was spectacular, really good and we were all very happy and very full. Service was great."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant one makes a whole get-away around. It's a journey and a destination you will not regret. Absolutely impeccable from the decor to the food to the service to all the little details. Very expensive so dress up and treat yourself to one of the best dining experiences of your life. 

Tip: if a couple, sit at the bar where you can watch the prep chefs. It feels more intimate than being seated in rows next to others.  You will feel just as taken care of, maybe more so."}
{"text":"Amazing food and decor. The place is a bit pricey but absolutely worth it. Try as many things as possible, everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"This spot has some delicious food but the service was big on the up charging and not so big on providing attentive care. 

Next time though, we are going to fast the day of and order the tasting menu. It looks fantastic."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places in Montreal truly deserving of 5 stars. I went here for my first date with my partner and retuned almost a year later with my mom. I am always impressed by their food, service, and ambiance. The place is gorgeous! Apparently is was renovated after a fire a few years ago. The focal point for me is the ceiling and the super comfortable chairs are a bonus. The kitchen is semi- open so you can watch the chefs diligently at work. It provides a nice show for kids. They have delicious drinks too! I don't drink alcohol but they always whip something up for me, asking what kind of flavors I prefer(sour, sweet, salty, fruity, etc.). This thoughtfulness is much appreciated. The menu changes seasonally and sometimes their vendors for meats do too, so make sure to ask whether or not certain things are halal when you go. 
The first time I went we had delicious meat balls covered in sour cherry sauce, and lamb and baklava ice cream (honestly a must try). They were so kind to us, we were wrapped up in conversation and passionately gazing into each other's eyes for hours. They gave us free dessert and on two separate occasions, different waiters came over to tell us how \"in love\" we seemed (even we could not have anticipated such a perfect first date). We were the last ones out of the restaurant that night and they didn't rush us at all. 

The second time I went, we stuck to lamb as their other meat was not halal, everything was delicious as usual and we had a lovely evening. This is an intimate, upscale spot, certain to impress a date or family visiting from out of town. 

It is definitely pricey- two people can share an entree and have 2 appetizers for around $75, but food for three will likely be close to $150 with tax and tip. I've seen everything from families to couples at this restaurant, if you book well in advance, you can find a nice spot here."}
{"text":"We were blown away by this place! I made a reservation for a Friday night about a month in advance. We arrived and were seated right away. Our server, Vito, was great. He was super personable, friendly and accommodating. We started with cocktails and we really enjoyed them, especially one that had gin with coriander. We knew we had to do the tasting menu because all the reviews before said it was amazing. Definitely do the tasting, you won't regret it! Plus it's a great price at 75 dollars. The courses are served family style rather than individually. The first course was the appetizer course which was a fettoush salad, four dips (hummus, baba ghanoush, beet hummus, and a red pepper dip), and beef tartar. They were all so delicious. The beef tartar was seasoned so well that I loved it, and I usually don't like beef tartar. The dips were delicious. Some of them had pine nuts and others had olives or chickpeas in them. The salad was delicious and fresh. The second course consisted of seafood. The first part was shrimp then octopus. The sauces they came in were so tasty. Then we moved onto meat. We started with chicken, which had so much flavor for chunks of white meat chicken. Then we had lamb chops that were cooked perfectly. Last, for dessert, we had a knafeh, which is cooked with semolina and phyllo dough with cheese in the middle and topped with syrup and pistachios. I could not say enough how delicious the food was. We enjoyed every single course and were blown away by each. If you're ever in Montreal, definitely go to Damas!!"}
{"text":"Food is simply delicious.... one of the best restaurants I've visited lately. Plates are very creative and high quality (the Fattoush salad, mezzes and the lamb are out of this word). Cocktails are  also creative and with very interesting flavors (try the Aleppo Gin Sour or the Hisbiscus Sipper). Staff and manager very friendly. Top of our list. If we come back this will be a must stop again."}
{"text":"Probably 1 of my favourite restaurant in the city. Had an incredible meal here with the family. Everything was on point. Best fattouche ever. The hummus with the lamb meat is to die for. Grilled meat and seafood were delicious. A bit on the pricey side, but well executed. The decor and ambiance are very good. They elevated the game."}
{"text":"As Arabs we were very sceptical. With our Syrian Arab we were even more skeptical. So when we were sat down in this busy restaurant and given menus with more $$ next to the items then you would usually pay for sitting in a cafe in Damascus we were starting to get a little more worried but as the dishes came out we slowly started to see that it was definitely worth the price tag. Traditional food presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. The blend of flavours was both comforting and satisfying. Large portions meant we had extra for the next day. The drinks were delicious and options for vegetarians weren't extensive but what was on offer was on point. Busy when we went so service wasn't of the same quality as the food but it was average. Would recommend it to anyone including our friends and family back home."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great service, great food, great wine - I'm a fan! I made an Open Table reservation here for my birthday dinner and noted the reservation as a birthday reservation. Unfortunately, they did not do anything special to acknowledge but whatever, I'm over it.

We started with the Four Cold Mezzes appetizer with their fresh naan bread. My husband is not a fan of eggplant but he loved the smoked eggplant dip and said that was his favorite of the four. I enjoyed the regular hummus which was just super creamy and seasoned perfectly.

I had the Fattet Makdous for my entrée which is three small eggplants stuffed with ground lamb. The eggplants are nestled in a tomato sauce which is mixed with nuts, fried pita chips, and yogurt. This dish definitely had many layers of textures going on and is something that I would like to replicate in my own kitchen at home. It was very good and even held up as my leftovers. The husband had the Fattet Mozat which is lamb shank confit over rice, nuts, yogurt, and fried pita chips. He had no problems eating it all right there. We had to try dessert even though we could barely move at that point so we ordered the baklava sampler which came with four baklava bites of two different flavors and a side of orange blossom ice cream. Everything was delicious and I'm glad we tried the four different dips to start."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal. Great balance between beautiful dishes, nice portions and very savoury. I personally love the seabass it's huge and perfect to share!!! The outside is crispy and must have over a dozen spices. The menu adapts well to a romantic evening or a fun large group who wants to share. Highly recommend not just if you want to have a taste of Syrian cuisine but if you want to try one of Montreal's best dining experiences!"}
{"text":"Great experience overall. Food was excellent, good portions and presentation, we were very disappointed with our waiter."}
{"text":"Stellar restaurant from start to finish.

Lately I have been lucky enough to venture out to a number of restaurants, and one of the best has been Damas. We truly enjoyed our visit, from the first spiced olives placed on the table to the last bites we stuffed into our expanding bellies.
We shared the 4 cold mezzes appetizer, which included (clockwise from the top of the photo):  Traditional Hummus, Eggplant Mutabbal, Beet Mutabbal, and Mouhamarra. It was served with fresh pita bread which was hot from the oven. They were all fantastic and totally distinct, with my favorite tied between the mouhamarra and the beet mutabbal. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again. We then shared the Grilled Meat Platter for Two, which included lamb chops, beef tenderloin cubes, chicken cubes, lamb kabab, grilled pita, and a smoke egglplant salad on the side. The seasoning on every item made the natural flavors of the proteins pop, and it was truly satisfying. 
I also had a glass of Côtes de Provence Rosé, which was light and slighty fruity. I am by no means a wine expert, but it was quite complementary to the food, especially the mezzes.
In essence, this is another spot I hope to return to, there are a number of items I would still love to try - perhaps one of the tasting menus next time."}
{"text":"I had such a spectacular meal the night before I thought there was no way Damas could match it.  But it did or very nearly did.  

Most importantly, the food.  My table of four shared the cold mezze platter, which included the Mouhammara (red pepper dip which was nutty and luscious with just the perfect hint of spice; definitely the crowd favorite), Mutabbal de betterave (beet dip which was light, had the roasted beet richness, yet remained balanced), Mutabbal d'aubergine (eggplant dip which was lightly citrusy and creamy), and humus (served in the middle with fabulous olive oil and tender whole chickpeas).  The dips were served with straight from the oven round bread which paired perfectly with all the dips.  Our table could not get enough.  Our friendly waiter mentioned that to him the best dish, which we hadn't ordered, was the fattoush salad, but we all appreciated the suggestion, which we didn't find by any means pushy or imposing.  We followed his suggestion and are thankful we did so.  The fattoush salad was balanced, light, fresh, texturally varied, really the best I've ever had.  

On to the entrees!  I have to say I think the Fattet Makdous was the standout.  This lamb-stuffed eggplant stuffed topped with tomato sauce, nuts, pita, yogurt sauce, coriander
and ghee was luscious and flavorful and rich and just divine.  Each person who tried it at the table nearly dropped to the floor.  And honestly, it could have been shared by two especially after we gobbled up so much bread with our appetizers.  The grilled lamb skewers were nicely spiced and beautifully presented with tiny hot peppers, grilled onions, and grilled tomato.  The layered chicken and stewed eggplant with lightly crispy rice and raisins was also very good.  The weakest dish at the table was the braised lentils with bulgor and caramelized onions,
tomato salsa, served with a side of creamy yoghurt, which was solid but nothing to write home about. It could have benefited from more spice or flavor.  

Because one of our entrees came out a few minutes after the others, we got a complimentary dessert which looked to us like a Syrian cannoli with creamy cheese in the middle, a light crepe around the side, and the flavor and aura of orange blossom, topped with pistachio.  And it was divine.  

As for drinks, I wasn't blown away by the hibiscus sumac drink I had which I found a tad sweet and one-note.  

The service was friendly and attentive, without being overly so.  I loved the decor with the hanging red tear-dropped glass lamps and beautiful floral tiled mosaics.  There's a lovely outdoor patio.  It took us awhile to be seated even though we had a reservation and were told our table would be ready in five minutes.  It took more like 25 minutes.  

This meal did knock me out.  I had to lie down to sleep pretty much immediately after but my oh my, was this meal worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious and fun night! Service is kinda slow...takes a while to get service but everyone is super friendly. We live out of town and booked it a month ago because we'd heard how good. 

The salad is delicious. The mushroom hummus is insane. So are all the dips. The meats - each one delicious  - my fave was the filet. Also the eggplant w pomegranates was delicious. 

Not gonna lie. It's a bit expensive. Mind you we had some delicious drinks. 

Bottom line - completely recommend. Very fun. Very tasty. Go there!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pure heaven. I have never had a better culinary experience in Montreal. The chiefs menu is unbeatable and the wine selection impeccable. Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"The very best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever had the pleasure to dine. You simply must order the tasting menu and get a. Title of wine. Let them do the rest!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best restaurant during the few days i was there. 
Went in on a Friday evening and had the following dishes:

We started the dinner with a few drinks:  Apricot Gimlet, Pommegranade cobbler, and Hibbiscus Sipper. ( All excellent drink choices)

We then had some apps:
Fattouch (Salad) 
Hummus Lahme (Best dish)

Dinner:
Shish Kabobs
Shish Taouk de damas
Sharat

Dessert/Coffee: Kumafa (very good)

Everything was so delicious! Had a chance to meet one of the owners who was very friendly in talking with us and being our own personal photographer! 

Absolutely loved the place and plan to come back the next time I'm near the area."}
{"text":"Top notch Syrian cuisine. The restaurant is exotic and the food favourable. The presentation of each dish was impressive. Fattoush salad with baked pita. My main dish was (Lamb)Kebab d'Alep. Roasted  sweet onions and hint of hot peppers served with tahini, Amazing! Dessert was Baklava and a cappuccino. Heavenly! The service was polite that it made the evening a great experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is at its new location in Outremont - a wonderful new spot with nice interior decor and an outdoor terrace. They are always busy and have an army of service staff. The food is fresh and full of flavour, with good presentation.  Definitely get the hummus and try the baba ganoush. I loved the shish taouk main dish. The lamb shank (see other picture) was also excellent. 
This restaurant certainly lived up to its word of mouth reputation and online rating!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant that serves food that you will remember! Wonderful flavours that just make you say, \"wow\". Great service and is worth every penny!

Ordered a variety of plates to share. The portions are large that you can share with a few people. The best idea is to share plates or do the tasting menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. Our waiter, Vito, took care of us the whole way through, making excellent recommendations and making us feel incredibly welcome, even though the place was super busy. The decor is lovely, and the staff is gracious, whether you're an anglophone or francophone. Don't miss the cocktails--especially the Aleppo Gin Sour. The hummus is amazing--creamy and served with housemade pita that arrives hot and puffy. And the kibbe is not to be missed. We also had the chicken shish taouk, which was cooked to velvety perfection and enlivened with bright flavor. A braised lamb dish was also good but suffered by comparison. We were too full for dessert, unfortunately, but they sounded tempting."}
{"text":"Damas was one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Everyone must try the tasting menu, its so worth the price and trying as many dishes as possible is NECESSARY, especially if you're not a local and might not be back. The meat and fish was tender and flavorful, the mezzeh were perfect, the desserts were the perfect touch, and the fatoosh salad was the best I've ever had. Sure I was full, but for once, not overwhelmed, and convinced that every taste and course was more than worth it. This restaurant will always stand out in my head, and I'm sure will continue to be the best of its kind even as it now sets the standard for high quality Syrian/Middle Eastern cuisine. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"visiting from nyc, our first night in montreal was on christmas so i had done some research and made reservations for damas. we went for it with the tasting menu and it. was. amazing. i've never had syrian food before but regardless of the cuisine, the flavors were complex and rich and every course was just so damn delicious. enough to make the entire trip to montreal worth it if nothing else. and our server, michael, was attentive and made sure we were enjoying every bite and gave up some lovely recommendations for the rest of our trip. it was a great christmas treat for us and i will be highly recommending this restaurant to anyone who visits montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing syrian place. Really. It's amazing. Check my pictures, they speak for themselves. Let Jarret d'agneau dans la sauce à yaourt was amazing. The hummus, the side salads, top quality. And they suggested a Lebanese red wine called les emirs that was not on the wine list that was very good, never expected a Lebanese wine to be this good."}
{"text":"Un de mes tops des tops de Montréal. Stylisé, sans prétention. Service hors paire, digne des grands restaurants mais encore une fois sans prétention. Une multitude d'éclats de saveurs en une seule bouchée. Et une sélections de vins pour tous les budgets et les palais. Bref, à essayer...un must!

---

On of my tops tops n MTL. Stylish without being snobbish. Top quality service and again very human and fun. Multiple bursts of flavors in one single bite. And a great wine selection for all budgets and taste buds.

You owe it to yourself...a must!"}
{"text":"As all the previous reviews have suggested, Damas is truly an amazing restaurant. The décor, the vibe, the service, and, most important, the food are all fantastic. 

We started by sharing a few appetizers, (eggplant mutabbal, falafel, fried kibbé, and fatouche).  If these apps were any indication, you really won't go wrong with any of the other apps on the menu. They were absolutely delicious, both visually and in terms of taste. 
As an aside, three falafels are served on the plate. Keep that in mind if you plan on sharing the dish among 4 or more people. You can ask for extras, but you'll be charged.
(A quick recommendation... Save the fattouch for last. This salad is perfectly acidic and super light. It is exactly what you want after a heavy, flavor-filled meat meal. I promise, you won't regret the palate cleanser.)

We then shared the shish taouk and the bamia, both of which were excellent. The chicken in the shish taouk was moist, flavorful, and perfectly charred. The lamb in the bamia was fall-off-the-bone tender and the sauce paired very well. 

So, even with all these amazing comments, why does this restaurant only get 4 stars? Sure, there were slight hiccups throughout the night, but the overwhelming issue is that I simply can't reward a restaurant that charges $35.00 and gives less than a chicken breast worth of chicken on their main dish. Or, one that gives about a quarter cup of eggplant mutabbal (dip) as a $10.00+ appetizer. The food is incredible at Damas and I'll certainly go back again. However, a 5-star restaurant is one that goes above and beyond to make sure their clients leave with only positive thoughts and the utmost praise. That wasn't the case at Damas. 

Small changes on the menu available on their website: 
-- The Fried Kibbé (plate with three lamb balls) is no longer offered as an appetizer plate. They are now sold individually as sides.  
-- The prices have gone up a couple dollars."}
{"text":"Reserve well in advance. We got to eat there by sitting at the bar - which was perfectly fine.  But you must come here. You will not be disappointed with this place.  It was hands down the best meal we had on our six day trip to Montreal and Quebec City.   Highly recommended.  We had the fatoush salad which was amazing - pricy at C$19 but it easily served two.  We also ordered the lamb meatballs served with a sour cherry sauce - to die for!!!  Finally, we had a Maqlouba - Rice with eggplant and chicken.  It was full of lots of other good things.  I'd go back just to order different things.  Eden served us at the bar - very helpful.  Great service. Nice people.  We felt very welcome there."}
{"text":"One of the rare restaurants that will thrill both vegetarians and meat-eaters. That's very hard to do. Highly recommend the vegetarian version of Sharhat and the cheese dessert. My husband loved his lamb dishes. I don't have much more to add to the other reviews here. Truly great food. I haven't had great food experiences while visiting Montreal, but this one meal made it worth the trip."}
{"text":"This was a next level experience for me! We were 4/people and we went to celebrate a birthday.

We started with the cold mezze platter (4 dips) and each one was better than the one before. 

We then had a 3 mains and split them (Shish Kabob, Shish Taouk & Rack of Lamb). Shish kabob was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and mouth watering. Shish taouk was delicious and solid. Last, but not least, my favorite dish of the night, rack of lamb, unreal! 

All of the plates were garniahed with extremely flavourful sides.

We were tempted to order a dessert and didn't know what to order, so the waiter advised us to order the sweet cheese cake with pistachios. Absolutely delectable!

Even for the price, which was expensive, I have absolutely nothing slightly bad to say.

Excellent dinner and evening!"}
{"text":"If Gary Johnson had eaten at Damas in Montreal, he would have saved himself from the embarrassment and ridicule from asking: \"what is Aleppo?\"... then again, he might have leapt up excitedly and said: ooh, I know. It's a Kabab ;)

So, I had to part with CAD 35 to find a memorable Shish Taouk in Montreal. Memorable for two reasons: (a) delicious; (b) actually Shish Taouk and not chicken shawarma erroneously called as Shish Taouk throughout the city.

Damas, the French name for Damascus, serving Syrian food in an upscale setting, with equal attention paid to the decor as to the food quality, is a fantastic restaurant with some specialty dishes that you won't even find in a larger city like NYC. The menu is extensive and spans charcoal grilled dishes, other entrees, hot and cold mezzes, and desserts. You can make a meal out of the mezzes or you can even get a tasting menu for CAD 75.

My server was knowledgeable of the cuisine and invested in my having a great meal. I always appreciate that deeply. But, I wanted to keep the meal light and so had to say no to quite a few of her recommendations such as the Fattoush salad, and the Hummus (despite her entreaties. But, hey: I dine at Zahav in Philly every other month and don't miss quality Hummus in my life). Instead I started with the Eggplant Mutabbal: Eggplant dip dotted with pomegranate seeds adding extra tartness and crunch served with warm and extremely puffy pita bread. This was followed by the delightful Shish Taouk, perfectly juicy and charred, served with fries dusted with Sumac. Finally, I had the baked to order Kunafa (sweetened cheese encased in semolina, covered with pistachios and drizzled with rose and orange blossom scented sugar syrup) for dessert and it was one of the better versions I've had. It's meant for two, as the server cautioned me, but I was able to eat my way through 3/4 before giving up. I was glad I strived :)

The only negative was that sitting at the bar opposite the open kitchen got hot and stuffy after a while from the heat of the grill. So, probably best to find another seat in the spacious restaurant.

Where Damas succeeds beyond any shadow of doubt is that it transcends the bucket people place ethnic restaurants into. Damas isn't an excellent Middle Eastern restaurant - it's simply an excellent restaurant as the throngs of diners will attest to.

(4.5 stars)"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 Montreal restaurants. It's out of the way (unless you're a TMR or Outremont resident) it's not a trendy jet setter place but a beautifully decorated and classy space with the Best Syria food in the city. 

The fattoush salad is amazing (i know you're thinking it's just salad but, game changer); Their homemade bread is dangerously good and I'd suggest getting hummus and beet mitabbal to go with it. The fatter mozat is you're feeling lamb is amazing and if you want something simple the shish taouk rocks. Everything on the menu is worth trying. 

My only suggestion is to make a tasting menu of a smaller size. 

All in all make the trip, it's awesome."}
{"text":"I won't deny that the food was delicious although the service was so-so throughout the meal. But overall, we had a good time.

What left a really bad taste though was when the bill came. We were a large party and we shared some plates and the restaurant's response to that was to deliver one bill and tell us to figure it out for ourselves. We then had to spend 20 minutes passing the bill up and down the table while everyone tried to figure out their share. The server ran a few credit cards through and then left before everyone had paid. So we had to wait for her to come back. We thought we were done and we left the restaurant only to have the waitress run after us on the street and tell us we'd not left much of a tip. This was due to poor math skills and/or a lengthy and confusing bill and not due t poor intentions so then we had to go through the whole process again but this time standing by the till. In the end one person just paid another large chunk of money rather than wasting any more time. Distasteful and not an experience that any of us would care to repeat. Dear restaurant: If you are so concerned about getting your tips then YOU do the math because by the end of this experience i truly believed that you deserved 0% tip on your $600 bill."}
{"text":"Amazing. My girlfriend and I were thinking we might hop up to Montreal during a recent stay in Vermont. Some friends recommended we go solely for Damas. And we did. It was worth it. We shared the Mutabbal d'aubergine, the octopus, and the leg of lamb - all were absolutely incredible. The service, likewise, was tremendous. This was a truly special meal in all respects and was certainly worth a trip to Canada."}
{"text":"This dining experience was 5 stars from beginning to end, our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was beautifully presented and tasted phenomenal, a must try if in the area!"}
{"text":"Damn delicious, damn pricey, but worth it. 

Our server was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I've ever had in my life. 

My husband and I were on our honeymoon, and during the planning of it we thought we had made a reservation here. When we get to Montreal, I realized I had never booked the place. We lucked into a 9pm reservation on a Thursday night (which our waitress Iris called it honeymoon luck) because it is impossible to get a seat in the restaurant last minute. 

The restaurant itself is perfectly decorated with middle eastern upscale vibes. We get seated, and our waitress Iris (Hi Iris, if you're reading this - you were the BEST!) tells us to remind her to explain the tasting menu to us. We're SO glad we went this route. It's $75 per person, but includes a 12 plate meal - fatoush salad, tar tar, hummus, beet hummus, pita, octopus salad, sea bass, veal, lamb chops, mint tea, pistachio gelato and so much more. And Iris explained each dish's ingredients to us and why it was brought out to us in the order it was. 

Each course was PHENOMENAL. Full of flavor in each and every bite. Had I ordered an entree on it's own, I wouldn't have picked any of the options that were given to me. So this was the perfect way to step out of my comfort zone. The octopus salad was so juicy and tender, and the veal was tied with it. We were seated right next to the kitchen, which normally I'd hate but I LOVED watched the chefs cook and prepare each dish to perfection. 

At the end of our dinner, which ended up being around 11:30 at night, Iris had brought out a Syrian shot for the three of us to toast to our recent nuptials. I really wish I could give this more than 5 stars. If you're ever in Montreal, you MUST go here!!"}
{"text":"Wow. We came here on a random tip from an unusually enthusiastic cab driver. He knew what he was talking about. It's kind of pricey, but it was the best meal I've had in months. We had the tasting menu, a tasty bottle of Greek rosé suggested by the waiter, oh, and I started off with a martini. I went in with limited expectations as a tired business traveler and came away very impressed by what Eastern Mediterranean food can be when it's prepared and served with care and thought. Chicken, lamb, sea bass, bread, etc. -- everything was delicious. Attentive and friendly staff and festive decor completed the picture."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Damas! Outstanding service at the bar and 5 star food including some of the best falafel I have ever tasted! A perk of sitting at the bar is that you can watch the incredibly skilled chefs making their beautifully presented dishes. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  A Delicious and freshly prepared feast.  Prices are higher than average but for the quality and taste, it is a steal!! Worth so much more. What an great experience; my tastebuds want more!! 5 stars are not enough!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars!  Believe the hype for sure.  I came here on a business dinner and now I see why they were so excited to take me here!  From the décor to the service to the food..OMG the food...it is simply outstanding.  The wine list is extensive (and expensive so be ready!). We shared what seemed to be a million tapas and were so stuffed, I ordered lentil soup as my main.  From the hummus to the babaganoush to the mohamara to the fatoush salad (with fun toasted pita bits!)...I just wish I had more room in my tummy for more.  I tried to come again on my short weekend trip to Montreal but sadly they were booked up...to be expected.

Tip:  book early if you want a  good dinner seating time here and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best meals I have had in Montreal.  We had the 95 dollar tasting menu which was supposed to be 6 courses.  We ended up with about 12 small plates and every one of them was heaven.  The staff is perfect and I am definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Very expensive but price is worth the experience. The meat is good but the overall presentation is poor."}
{"text":"Très bon et beau restaurant !
La cuisine est savoureuse et nous fait voyager.
Mon jarret d'agneau était excellent tout comme le plat pris par ma compagne.
Attention les portions sont assez conséquentes donc réfléchissez et n'hésitez pas à demander conseil aux serveurs.
La carte des vins est forte intéressante et mon vin au verre était de bonne facture.
Le service est très bon.
Entièrement satisfait de cette visite.
La prochaine fois que je reviendrais j'essayerais de prendre le menu dégustation :)"}
{"text":"We went as a large group for a friend's birthday for the tasting menu. Everything about this place was superb: interior design, the menu, the drinks, and THE FOOD. Everything we got on the tasting menu was either really good, or the best I've ever had. The standout dishes were the fatoush salad (so much texture and flavour), the vegetarian dumplings with yogourt and cheese sauce, and the nest-like dessert. Totally worth the price. The waiter was funny and attentive. Now that we've tried a little bit of everything, we know what to get next time (extra extra large bowl of the salad please!)."}
{"text":"I had an incredible dinner here, and it was the highlight of my trip to Montreal! We made reservations about a month in advance because we knew that this place had such a great reputation. The servers were all really nice and helpful.

I got a really refreshing cocktail called rose ginger fuzz and my boyfriend got a Canadian beer which he enjoyed. I think I mistakenly assumed that the dishes were going to be small, so we over-ordered a bit. We shared a hot and cold mezze (falafel salad and beef tartare), which were both amazing. The falafel salad also came with fresh pita bread, which was a wonderful addition.

For main courses, I got the Moujadarra (lentils with bulgor and carmelized onions) and my boyfriend got the lamb kebab. We will be thinking fondly of this food for a while... wishing they would open one up in NYC!!"}
{"text":"De tous les restaurants de cuisine du moyen orient que j'ai essayé, de loin le meilleur et le plus authentique. Le décor est très beau et l'ambience très vivante. J'y suis allée pour y célébrer mon anniversaire. 

Malheureusement, nous sommes tombées sur un serveur très moyen qui ne s'est pas forcé de la soirée pour nous servir. Nous avons commandé une entrée très simple de 4 mezzes froids qui a pris plus de trentes minutes à arriver! De plus, lorsque le plat principal est arrivé (maqlouba d'agneau) il n'a même pas pris la peine d'enlever les plats des entrées. Notre table pour deux étant assez petite, il n'y avait pas assez de place pour mettre le plat principal au centre de la table afin de pouvoir partager (ce qui est le concept et la manière de manger dans un restaurant arabe). Il a fallu lui faire savoir que c'était peu commode afin qu'il débarasse les assiettes. De plus, il n'est jamais venu nous demander si tout était à notre goût, nous donner de l'eau ou nous servir du pain pita (qui est à volonté et excellent en passant). Bien que ma compagne lui ait mentionné au début du repas que c'était mon anniversaire, il n'est pas venu avec un dessert et chandelle pour le dessert. Nous avions pourtant vu d'autres serveurs servant d'autres tables ayant amené des gâteaux d'anniversaire!! Bref, nous sommes vraiment tombées sur le petit trou-de-cul du restaurant, dommage j'aurais aimé un petit effort de sa part surtout qu'il savait que nous venions à son restaurant pour une occasion spéciale."}
{"text":"A must when you visit montreal. The food is out of this world and the waiters are super fun and friendly. 10 stars"}
{"text":"This wasn't just any restaurant. This was one of the better restaurants I've eaten at. I've never had the experience before in a restaurant that changes what I think a restaurant could be. This was quiet and beautiful. It is such a beautiful amazing decor. First stop was the bar where they reminded me of the deep history of bar concoctions, they kept saying you must try this drink with gin (can't remember the name now). It was fairly non descriptor glass, with a green hue but one taste was mind changing perhaps it was cucumber. My first Syrian restaurant but beyond ethnic food this was a great food for people who eat. Some of the diners were the well heeled but others were folks you might see on the streets of Brooklyn. I definitely remember hummus, it was so good and we were so busy eating that I can't recall all we ate but the lamb tickled my tongue."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend and we both liked the food a lot . The food is good and worth to try it at least once ! The Fatouch salad I had here was so different than any other fatouch I have ever had in my life and I loved it ! The kebabs I had were also good ! Nothing to complain but over priced tho !! But I will definitely go back here !  Nice staff , super friendly and welcoming ."}
{"text":"C\"est de loin la meilleure cuisine à Montreal. Le service est excellent et la nourriture est fraiche. Je conseille la terasse si le temps le permet."}
{"text":"Went here for the tasting menu and it was amazing! Nice ambiance. 

Beef tartare - My first time having tartare, enjoyed it much more than I thought I would
Salad - very flavorful and delicious
Pita + hummus, eggplant, beet, red pepper = great. My favourite was the beet
Shrimp = good
Octopus was good
Chicken and garlic was amazing. THE CHICKEN was OMG delicious. The pepper was very hot 
Lamb - alright, but not a big fan of lamb in general
Baklava and ice cream - simple and good, not mind-blowing.

I was stuffed honestly after the salad but yum yum anyway. I would return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Pricy entrees but superb dining experience and one of the most delicious dinners i've had! A MUST in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal for the weekend with my friend. After reading rave reviews about this place, I decided to try Syrian food for the first time! Oh boy.. I'm so glad with my decision. We had reservation for Saturday night dinner. Despite our reservation, they took some time to get us seated as they were running behind schedule. But once we got seated, the treatment was amazing. The server was amazing as she thoroughly explained the menu. Since we had been eating throughout the day, we didn't have the appetite for the traditional Syrian tasting menu. Instead we chose the Baba Ghannouj salad as the appetizer and it was very tasty and fresh. For our entree we chose Maqlouba & their famous Fattet Mozat. Personally I loved Maqlouba a lot more than Fattet Mozat. The chicken was tender, soft and delicious. My friend loved the Fattet Mozat as the lamb was cooked very nicely with lot of flavors. Overall our experience was amazing with the food. The ambience was perfect and cozy for small groups or large party. The servers were knowledgeable and prompt. I'm extremely happy with my first Syrian food experience... will recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"This was truly an amazing meal. I left so incredibly full - promptly fell into a food coma once I got home. 

wI brought my sister here when she visited me over the weekend. I had heard about it this place and it was always difficult to get a reservation, so I wanted to try it with her. 

The menu consisted of cold mezzes, hot mezzes, Syrian grill, and Syrian specialities. There were a lot of options and they all looked super good. Pardon my spelling for some of the dishes! For mezzes we started with the fattoush salad, this consists of tomatoes, peppers, pomegranate seeds, crunchy pita bites - very refreshing and super tasty. Then the borek jibne, which was a fried dumpling filled with melty cheese. Followed by the lamb humus, regular humus with grilled lamb in the centre accompanied by freshly baked pita bread! For the entree, we had a lamb dish with yogurt and rice, the name evades me. It was also very good. 

The whole meal was very good, no single dish stood out because they were all very tasty. However, the showstopper was the baklava ice cream that came with two ice cream cone shaped baklava. It was so good, I was upset that the portion was so small because I could have had double it! 

The meal was truly exceptional, but I do think it was pretty expensive. I would reserve this for a special occasion or a meal you don't have to pay for haha. Otherwise, I would be very happy to come again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The fattoush was incredibly fresh and flavorful; the lamb tartare and kebab were juicy and bursting with flavor.  I thought I liked Syrian food before, but Damas really takes it to the next level.  The staff were top-notch--our server spotted walnuts (to which I'm allergic, a real hazard in this region) in one dish and whisked it away before I could touch it.  The dining area is spacious and modern, a real improvement over their former home.  Despite the size, it gets booked up well in advance so do reserve early!"}
{"text":"Just Wow. From the octopus salad through the smoked eggplant, from the lamb dumplings to the hummus. What a culinary treat. This off the beaten path gem of a restaurant is worth the drive to this otherwise uneventful neighborhood. If you time it right you could do an earlier visit to the nearby Jean Talon Market which is one of the best in the world."}
{"text":"Damas gets 5 stars. Gorgeous restaurant with flawless service, and food made for gods. We started with the fattouche salad which had a nice surprise topping of pomegranate seeds. We then split both an appetizer labneh and falafel plate which was perfectly accompanied by tahini and traditional salad (I was so happy I saved some of my piping hot pita to use for my falafel!). For our main we were turned onto the pan fried sea bass Samke Harra by our waiter...we asked for his recommendation and he did not let us down. The market price scared me initially but boy were we happy we took his suggestion. Crispy sea bass filleted in half and stuffed with pine nuts, sautéed vegetables, capers, and tarator sauce. It was phenomenal, and potentially even worth it's high ticket price of $55. You pay for what you get, and what we got was outstanding. We got the sumac fries on the side.

We LOVED Damas and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. So delicious. Everyone said his was their favorite place and I have to agree! The lamb shank was great. The faroush salad sooo good! Liked the cheese but a bit too salty but still ate and enjoyed. They kindly served us even though we were very late for reservation. Great service, fabulous food and cool decor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montreal. Expensive but worth every penny. Service is fantastic, food is amazing and flavorful. You will remember your night at Damas for a long time and you will want to visit again as fast as possible."}
{"text":"TLDR: A fantastic dining experience that everyone should enjoy at least once.

Damas is now one of my favourite restaurants in the Montreal. The decor, the flavours, the service were all phenomenal. I haven't been to many Syrian restaurants, but I am so tempted to declare Damas as one of the best because of the fabulous time we all had.

The first time I went we got the tasting menu, which was insane. You will be eating for hours and hours. Do not plan anything after as you will not be able to move. 

We received so much food, that I'm not sure I can remember every single item we received. I'm quite sure it included:

1) Three delectable dips with fresh pita
The beet mutabbal was not just vibrant in colour but in flavour as well. The hummus was smooth, and the baba ghannouj was delightful.

2) Fattouch salad, which was light and refreshing but still bold in flavour. 

4) The kibbe nayye (beef tartar) was one of my favourite things of the evening and was perfectly spiced.

5) The humus lahme, was fantastic. Who knew that cubed lamb and hummus would be so good together.

6) The kibbe was the best kibbe I ever had. Although I may have just had this during my second visit...

7+8) The warm octopus salad was enjoyed by the two individuals at the table who liked seafood. As was the Samke Harra (sea bass) later on in the meal.

9) The Sharhat, which was one of the best veal dishes I ever had.

10) Lamb chops that were magnificently and perfectly cooked.

11+12) There were two desserts at the end of the meal. First was the best baklava ice cream in the world, if you go you must order it. There was also knafe which was spongy cheesy deliciousness. They were both complimented by beautiful mint tea.

The next time we went I got to try a few more delicious food items such as the kefta nayye (I prefer the kibbe nayye). Their dishes are meant to be shared, so make sure you go with people who love food. 

Definitely, a food experience you have to have in Montreal. Make a night out of it and order the tasting menu, you will not be sorry"}
{"text":"As a New Years resolution, I have decided to broaden my taste buds and try new stuff. What better day to start my resolution than on my birthday. I just came back from Damas, and all I can say is that I am so happy I tried this place. First of all it is beautifully and taste fully decorated, it transports you in another country. The ambiance is very charming, the staff is extremely professional and courteous. The know the menu inside out and can give you great suggestions. 

Now let's talk about the main subject, the food, as appetizers we had the Damas Fattoush, the pureed eggplant and the octopus warm salad. The fattoush was so different than your typical fattoush, the put a twist on it and they brought   It to a whole other level. I have tried octopus before but don't like the fishy taste and smell to it. This dish was nothing I had tasted before, the seasoning was perfect, the dressing was so delicate and tasty, a must try.

As a main dish I had the shish taouk, chicken so juicy it was accompanied but sumac fries. WOW! It had a sour garlic taste to it, it was fantastic. I had also ordered a side of yogurt salad which tasted like tsaziki but better.

Last but not least for dessert I had menthe tea and a fried cheese that had a bit of rose water. To
Be honest i didn't know what to make of the desert, I am still thinking about it. You know when you eat something and you don't really know if you like it or not so you keep eating. That's what happened to me. 

This place is not just a place to go eat, it an experience. Prices are high but you get the quality to go with it."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The eggplant dip and beet dip was the best I've had.  The meat is cooked to perfection with well balanced flavors.  Reasonable wine list as well"}
{"text":"What an amazing night, what a delicious food, what a beautiful terrace and of course wonderful company. I spent some time digging for my five stars review for the old location of Damas, but I soon realized this is pointless. Damas has reinvented itself with a class and dining there was such a pleasure. 

For starters our party of seven shared the fattoush salad, the traditional humus that is still like homemade, the red beet mutabbal (my favorite) and the eggplant mutabbal. The inflated puffy warm pitta bread was perfect and helped to clean those plates from everything that may have remained. Myself, I had to order my sour cherry lamb kabab, I have been raving and dreaming about it since the visit of the old location of Damas. Still very good dish, but I think I liked better its presentation in the past. The meat balls are now served over pita bread and I really prefer the version in a bowl, where the ingredients were all mixed and the pita bread was aside so I can dig in with it if I want to. 

Our crowd had an identical choice of main, the outstanding shish taouk, a perfect choice if you are not in experimental mood, it comes with these yummy french fries one must have. The more original choices of shish kabab and lentil with bulgur were well appreciated. My choice was a dish called bamia, lamb prepared with baby okra, plums, apricot and garlic, the meet was falling off the bone and the food was somehow so homey yet exclusively delicious. If you decide to go with it as a main choice I would recommend to have a very light appetizer as the portion is generous. 

Desserts were no brainer. The baklava ice cream is magic, leave some space for it. 

I absolutely forgot the name of my cocktail, it was a gin based, spicy and citrusy magic and the old fashioned test passed with five stars. I didn't have a chance to look at the wine list, the fine gentleman choosing the bottle had to ask for recommendation what white is close to chardonnay and we ended up with tasty white from Greece. That reminds me to honour the service as it was wonderful as everything else that night. 

Needless to say I left Damas well fed and overly satisfied. I will repeat this fine dining exercise very soon for sure."}
{"text":"Yes, it is that great. All the 5 star reviews are spot on. Everything is so tasty. The fattoush salad is the best salad we ever ate. I can't rave about it enough. One of the best restaurants in the city. They also have a separate dining space for larger parties."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now and every visit has been better than the last. This restaurant and their phenomenal service is mere definition of excellence! It is now our official special occasions place. My husband and I can't wait to bring our families here to experience their world class service. Damas, you have my stolen my heart!"}
{"text":"If anything I dislike eating late at night, but the only reservation i could get was at 9:30pm. If Damas showed up \"#6 of 4 838 Places to Eat in Montreal\", then of course I would make the exception and have high expectations. 

Our waiter was very friendly and knew the menu like the back of his hand.
Any questions you had, he knew the answer.

What we ordered:
1. Fattouch
2. Fattet Mozat
3. Mixed grilled plater for 2 people
4. Apricot alcohol drink (i don't remember the name)


I usually don't order salad, but I am telling you Fattouch was delicious and a must order as an appetizer- It's basically a mixed vegetable, a little peppery salty and lemon flavoured.

Yes the portions are small for what you pay for.
But the quality is there. Cheaper doesn't mean better and pricey doesn't mean better either.


This place definitely gets my approval."}
{"text":"I had never had Syrian food before and this place opened up my eyes. We got the Christmas tasting menu. Excellent food. The best lamb and dessert I've ever had. The waiters were extraordinary. Of you get Alan and Julian, tip them well. They can pair wine with food spectacularly. This place is something I would definitely recommend to anyone coming to Montreal."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow!! The food was exceptional, the service matched! Three of us went for dinner and decided to share 3 Meze and 2 entrees ... we were stuffed! We enjoyed everything we ordered and even though we didn't have room for dessert, we ordered some anyway! Glad we did 

Mouhammara, fattouch salad (best I've ever had) and shish borek for Meze's and Kabab Alep & Fattet Makdous (stuffed eggplant) for mains. Everything was delish, the flavours and textures were supreme!

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu $75 CAD/person. Came with a heavenly selection dips - hummus (3), eggplant (5), red pepper (5, best thing I've eaten this year), and sweet beet (5) dips, a fattoush salad (5), freshly baked pita (5), beef and lamb tartare (5), grilled octopus (3.5), grilled shrimp (5), chicken kebab (5, I didn't know chicken could taste this good), grilled lamb chop (1.5, worst dish of the night, largely tasteless aside from the flame taste), baklava ice cream (3, good but lazy).

Overall, the food was a solid 4.5 to 5. Service was great. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"We vacationed in Montreal a couple of weekends ago and made Damas our first meal in town - and it was an amazing one! Our waiter was outstanding and helped us continuously in finding courses that were safe for my son who has multiple food allergies. Every dish that we ordered was delicious - and the cocktails were creative and delectable. The table next to us ordered the tasting menu and we were incredibly jealous as every dish that landed on their table looked better than the last! If we ever make it back we will definitely go with the incredibly affordable tasting menu! What a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back to this resturant next time I visit Montrèal!!!!! Such great service and, it was my first time trying Syrian cuisine. The lamb is to DIE for, especially with the wine. Service was great too. Many tourists visit this place all over CA and the US"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was fantastic! So fresh and delicious! The service was great too."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate hubby's birthday. We went with the tasting menu of $75. Aside from the pita bread and dips with salad, there was a lot of protein in this menu and I felt it could be balanced more. There was shrimp, octopus, chicken, lamb... no side dishes or carbs, just the meat or fish. Sure, there was some vegetable garnish in those dishes but not enough. Having said that, everything tasted good. Dessert was good but the ice cream was better than the piece of baklava. Service was outstanding, everyone we interacted with was incredibly friendly. If you ever make it out to Philadelphia, try Zahav. I'd say it's a better version of Damas."}
{"text":"The decor at Damas is very nice, warm and inviting. Service is great, the waiters are attentive and helpful. Perfect for any occasion if you love good food!

Yes, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here. This was my 2nd time. BEST fattoush I've had in Montreal! The grilled octopus was amazing. The walnut-stuffed seabass had crispy skin (insert drooling emoji) and was so frigging delicious, I wished I could eat forever. Lol!!!

I definitely recommend this place, take your parents, take your cousin, take your date, or just go and enjoy a nice meal by yourself, who cares, the food is so good you won't notice you're alone"}
{"text":"I'd like to start out by stating that I've had the privilege of eating homemade Syrian/Armenian/Arabic cuisine for the better part of the last 15 years. Damas is a modern take to this cuisine and I held them to a high standard to meet and then exceed my expectations of them.


THE GOOD :

- The warm pita bread was amazing! So fresh and soft... it puffs up into a delicious empty pita bread balls that you just have a great time tearing apart and making good use of with your plates of food. We received multiple servings of it and it was highly appreciated by the entire table.

- Thibault was our waiter was on point and very helpful the entire dining experience. Left a strong impression and he seemed very passionate about his job. Exceptional service, very professional without going out of his way to be charismatic. 


THE BAD (or just average?!)

- The mojito we had was either watered down or lacked flavor, our entire table ordered it and we all collectively felt the same. It was alright but expensive cocktails need to be better than this.

- The hummus was very good but what happened to the portion size? It barely was enough to be a small tasting for 3 people! Kindly provide 2 options with the smaller one being cheaper and the larger one being slightly more than the $10 price-tag you're asking.

- The meat grill plate was beautifully presented. Since no one at my table likes lamb other than myself, I ate both of them. One of them was exceptionally tender and flavorful and the other was quite fatty. I was perplexed how his happened. The shish-taouk and filet mignon was perfectly done! The garlic dip! Despite being FAR too small... was exceptional! The meat grill plate came with side fries, they were good as well. However, I definitely didn't think this plate merited the $90 price-tag.

- The fattoush plate was a spin to my favorite salad that I really enjoy when done right. In Damas' version, there were pomegranate in it with a different dressing.... it was still very good but I ended up craving the authentic version when I left the establishment.

- The sesame falafel plate came with only 3 small falafel balls with a tiny side of tahini sauce and homemade pickle. It was good but I've had far better falafel.


THE UGLY

- Exceedingly expensive to the point we felt we were being taken advantage of. Our meal ended up being $100 PER PERSON and we only ordered a single drink each! AND I left with enough room in my stomach to still be somewhat hungry!


Damas is a true gastronomic experience where you can enjoy marked-up plates that look great and can be highly praised by those not familiar with this type of cuisine. If your goal is to impress someone on a special occasion (such as a date or anniversary), this is the place to go as long as the other person isn't overly familiar with this cuisine.

I'd recommend trying the $75 mezze plate and temper your expectations particularly if you're familiar with this type of cuisine... keep an open mind.

As someone familiar with this cuisine, overall it was good but all plates came somewhat short. How exactly are 3 falafel balls priced at $16? How is a small fattoush salad $19? A meat grill plate for 2 people priced at $90? Are we for real??

Nonsense. 

The value given (small plates, exaggerated pricing) will prevent me to come back. Competition is also better, is authentic and costs half as much to enjoy."}
{"text":"This is the best Syrian restaurant I ever been too. The food is amazing, everything is done with perfection."}
{"text":"Probably the best Syrian food I have ever tried. Everything we had was delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food. If you are visiting Montreal you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"I have no words for this place; I don't think I have ever tried a place where from Customer Service, Ambiance to food is so remarkable. We ordered a 75$ all you try menu...and it was worth every penny. Good job & keep up the good work you guys are doing."}
{"text":"What a beautiful experience! I read some incorrect/outdated info online that there were two tasting menus: 5 courses at $75, and 6 courses at $95. Well, this was not the case for me. It was actually $85 for 12-16 small courses and that was the only option. I was actually pleasantly surprised, as I was debating back and forth between the 5 course or 6 course option, and this seemed to be a happy middle ground. 

My server asked if I wanted to know anything about the menu, or if I wanted it to be a surprise. I opted for a surprise and I'm so happy that I did! It was a delightful and interesting foodie adventure from start to finish. Due to this, I don't want to go into specifics or post a photo of every dish - I don't want to ruin the fun for anyone else. I would highly suggest going into Damas with an empty stomach and an open mind! 

I felt like there was a good balance of flavours, textures, ingredients - everything! Out of all 12 dishes, there was only one that I did not like. 

I definitely left full. In my opinion, it was worth every penny. Make sure you have a couple of hours to spare, as it's definitely not a quick experience either.

This is a Montreal must-try!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. The fattouch salad alone would bring me back again. We had the tasting, every dish that came out was better than the last. The food, the cocktails, the service, the ambience, everything way beyond impressive. If only I could make them open a restaurant in New York that would be perfect."}
{"text":"This restaurant is reason enough to come to the city of Montreal. The standard tasting menu was the best I've ever had. Cool ambiance and our server Iris had a real warmth about her. If you visit Montreal and don't eat here, you are really missing out."}
{"text":"I went to the old Damas before it burnt down and I remember liking it then. This one is so much more fancy and i like it even more! The walls are covered in red tapestry and there are lamps of different shapes and sizes hanging from the ceiling. The food was delicious and the drinks were amazing! The arrangement and overall styling of the dishes were on point! Good job on plating!

I started with a gin cocktail called the Hibiscus Sipper. It had hibiscus in it and sumac on a cucumber. It was so pretty and it was so refreshing. I then had the Aleppo Gin Sour cocktail. It came in a martini glass and consisted of gin, orange blossom, pepper, coriander and Aleppo pepper. I was worried that I would not like this drink since I'm not a big fan of coriander but it was very good and I almost like it more than the hibiscus one. I was really impressed with their cocktails. 

For food we started with two cold mezzes. The first being the traditional humus. It had chickpeas in the middle and it came with inflated pita bread. OMG So good! We also had the Kibbé nayyé (beef tartar with bulgor, basil flowers, seven spices and nuts). This is definitely the best I've ever had. The meat was very tasty and fresh.

Then we had one hot mezze... the Sharhat (milk fed veal filet mignon deglazed with lemon, garlic and Aleppo pepper). This was good but it was the least memorable dish for me. Lastly we had the mixed grilled platter for two people. It came with lamb chops, chicken, filet mignon, and beef.... basically two of everything My favorite meat was the chicken and the lamb. The chicken was very juicy. The filet mignon was also good but I prefer the way Persians make their filet minon (aka barg). We also had a side of fries with sumac. I couldn't finish the fries because I was so full. There was so much food! Everything was so delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant! It is pretty big and gets packed so definitely reserve ahead of time! It would be good place to go with a group of friends or with date."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! Although the service was quite ordinary, I'm still giving the restaurant a 5 stars uniquely for the food. We tried the tasting menu for three. 

I absolutely loved the pita, hummus and other spread they served. I could eat simply that and be satisfied. I love trying new food and every plate they brought was a delight in my mouth. If you're in town for a limited time, you can't go wrong choosing Damas."}
{"text":"Hands down best meal I had during my visit in Montreal. Ambiance is amazing, staff is great and knows every in and out about the menu, food is unparalleled. The 5 course tasting menu is the way to go. This isn't just a normal meal at a normal restaurant, it's an experience. We arrived at 630pm and didn't leave until 930pm."}
{"text":"Go there when hungry: the tasting menu will fill you up, the prices are a little high but worth every penny given the quality of ingredients.  The ambiance is a little busy/noisy, festive.  Service is great.  If you can make the trip to Outremont go for it, was not disappointed once."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience!! 

We tried their 6 course tasting menu for dinner! 
Although we only had a light lunch that day, the food was still a bit too much to finish. But boy it was totally worth it!! 

Each dish on the menu opened a world of flavours. We specifically liked their Fattoush salad, Lamb chops and Hummus Lahme (They also have a veg version). 
The wine didn't go well with the food. So maybe next time we'd try one of their signature drinks instead.

A glass of wine and food set us up at $130 per person after tip and tax. There's also a five course tasting menu available at $75pp. I'd highly recommend trying their tasting menu on your first visit."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying this place is a gem!

In this restaurant, you'll pay 31$ plus tax for 2 chicken brochettes and 10$ for a small portion of hummus... To be fair however, you can't really complain because you know the prices before you order. So if it doesn't suit your budget, stay away or keep it in mind for special occasions. 

Now why is it relatively expensive? Because it's amazing. The quality is fabulous. Each ingredient is perfectly fresh. The best fattoush salad in Montreal is here. The grilled meats and the specialities are all equally delicious. 

They bake their pita bread and bring it to you hot from the oven! Now just that to me is worth 5 stars!

They have a lot of staff so service is very efficient on top of being super friendly. The decor is beautiful. 

Only negative point: we really didn't like the lamb meatballs in cherry sauce. The meat/lamb flavour was too strong/overpowering for our taste."}
{"text":"Top 5 meal....ever.   

First, ....location is outside center of Montreal, but worth drive.   

Ambiance = 4

Food 5.5 (lol).  Seriously the best Persian food that I have ever had.  They excel at elevating even the simplest dish.   

Service = 4. 

Add this to your list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Beautiful service, atmosphere and food! 
This is my second time here and I haven't left disappointed. The service and quality of food is impeccable and you can tell that the food is made with love. The fattoush salad is one of my favourites and I do enjoy the ice cream/baklava dessert. They have a wonderful selection of dips and fresh pita! Take note: it does come with a price. Be sure to spend a bit more than usual... but oh so worth it! RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal dining experience! Daniel, our sever, went above and beyond to recommend dishes and make us feel at home. The food was amazing; my boyfriend, who lived in the Middle East for years, was even impressed. Damas is miles above any local competition...we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"First time I go to Damas since they moved to the new location. Love the interior design and ambiance. Food was as tasty as all the times I went to the previous location if not even better (I was very hungry). Service was excellent. This restaurant is a must try. Drink arak instead of wine for a try, you'll enjoy the food even more."}
{"text":"What can be said about this place that hasn't already been said! 5 for everything, food, service, wine list, decor, ambiance.
There is a 75$/person and 95$/person tasting menu. Which sounded great, since pretty much everything is shareable, we build our own tasting menu by combining a few cold mezzes and a few hot mezzes.
Everything was outstanding! Each dish flavorful and unique. Worth every penny and more!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and wonderful service. The dishes are great- while the prices are high, the portions for mains are HUGE and delicious. My bf and I tend to order a lot bc he can eat a ton, but even we couldn't finish the meal and had to take our food to go. After a disappointing dinner the night before, we were so happy and thrilled with the yummy food and friendly service. Everything from the labne dip, fried dumplings, lamb entrees, dessert - all were unforgettable- we'll definitely be coming back to Montreal to dine at Damas again!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals of my life!

We ordered the Kbeibat, Foul Moudammas, Moujaddara, and Fattet Makdous. Each dish was so flavorful and fresh, with healthy portions. We loved that we could have Syrian special dishes that weren't just kabob and also vegetarian-friendly. The Foul Moudammas was the best I've ever had. The saffron & cardamom tea reminded me of tea with my grandma. :)

For dessert, we had the baklava ice cream, which was very clever and cute ice cream cone shaped baklava with ice cream.

Service was very friendly and bilingual, if only a little overzealous with the constant water filling.

Also, the menu is beautiful, but it is so, so hard to flip the pages. 

Overall incredible meal, definitely need a reservation!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The food is well prepared, flavorful and unexpected.

We did the tasting menu, and it is a. lot. of. food. We couldn't finish all of our lamb, and I love lamb!

It would be very hard to pick a favorite dish that we tried but I must tell you, dear Yelp reader, that the Fattouch salad was the bomb.com. I would eat a salad every meal if they were all that spectacular. The different dips they provided with bread were so colorful and very yummy. It was had not to go overboard on them. Glad we didn't because, my oh my, the lamb and shish taouk were great. Presentation was also very lovely.

Drinks were spot on. I had a cocktail made with rosewater that went very well with our tasting menu. I feel rosewater is hard to get right in drinks, but this one was well done.

So something else 'unexpected' was that the power went out! Thankfully this occurred at the end of our meal. We were seated at the bar so we got to witness the major hustle the crew in the kitchen did to still get orders out. All using their cellphones for light. They started bringing out candles to all the tables. It was very romantic. 

Our server was very polite, funny and attentive. A+ on service.

To top it off, the restaurant is beautiful! The patio also looked very inviting. Will have to request outside next time. Yes, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went here for our Anniversary. It's pretty upscale. I had the Rose ginger fizz, which was pretty decent in my opinion but nothing that blew my mind.
We then ordered some hummus & boresh jibne. The boresh jibne was excellent, must try if you visit this restaurant! It was filled with cheese & was pretty crisp.
We then ordered shish taouk, which was pretty nice but nothing extraordinary.
We ordered baklava, which was great. 
Overall, it was good dinner, there was nothing that we ordered and didn't like.
I don't think you can really go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"This is only my second trip to damas, first in 2014 at the old location, and second Xmas day 2017. 

My first trip was absolutely magical and they blew all expectations out of the water. I tried to recreate that moment this year and the service is just as good but the food just lacked the special touch it had back then. We were seated by the grill and the cooks were amazing but you can tell they were pumping out dishes hardcore. They have \"perfected\" their formula for large service but it just lost a bit of the slow intimacy you associate with a local gem. 

The lamb shank no where as good as I remembered it - the food came out in all one temperature which is disappointing because one of the most mesmerizing parts of this dish was the cool yogurt contrasting the hot lamb. The almond slivers were less so there was less textural contrast. Instead of a tender yet intact shank we had pieces of lamb that were all tender mixed in with the rice and warm yogurt all at the same temperature and almost texture. The fattoush was something new I didn't try last time, it was good but I wouldn't call home back it. 

Overall it's still really good but it's not as special as it was at the beginning. It reminds me of a Jose Andres joint in dc these days. Not a terrible comparison but I think anyone who's been to damas in the past would agree the food they served was the type to haunt your dreams and these days it's just \"good.\""}
{"text":"I've been dying to return to the restaurant since it moved to its new location, but it could be hard to get reservations on weekends. We decided to go in the middle of the week and the place was packed. 

The food and atmosphere deserves a five star,  but we really didn't find our waiter helpful, because although we eventually realized that he knew the menu inside out, when asked for his initial help, he repeated all the options listed on the menu. Yes, we know how to read, but we did specifically ask for recommendations! Anyhow, it took an hour before  we placed our order and we certainly wished that could've been expedited with his help. I wish I had done my homework before eating there! 

For four women with moderate appetite, we were pretty full after four mezzes. In fact, we only managed to eat half of the two main courses we ordered. I think it was really because their warm pita breads were so fantastic we couldn't help but eat two of them! We  thought the mezze sizes were very decent. 

My favorite items were the hot mezzes. The grilled octopus and the grilled akkawi cheese were amazing. The cheese paired very nicely with the fattouche salad. The beet muttabbal was a nice alternative to baba ghannouj but I wish there was an option of three cold small mezzes that I could try out. It is true that the cold mezzes are all offered in the discovery menu, but it  was the hot mezzes that I enjoyed the most. 

The main courses were not quite as memorable, maybe because we were all full by then. We ordered a shish taouk that had a very tasty side of sumac fries. The rest of the plate did not stand out so much. The other main we shared was a fattet makdous that I wasn't a fan of, mainly because I personally don't enjoy eggplants. It was definitely a huge portion that could have easily been shared. I really wanted to try the sea bass, but for $70 a plate, I wasn't quite ready for it. Next time, I would order it with the $75 discovery menu.

Overall, I had a very enjoyable evening. I would say that the food is fantastic and aside from the small ordering hiccup, it was a very pleasant experience. I think the sizes of the plates are perfect for sharing between four people. Without drinks, we paid about $50 including taxes and tips. Yes, it is more expensive than it used to be, but then again, prices have gone up all over town and at least you can be assured that you will have a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Really liked it from the start.... great ambiance, service was good, and the food was really good. Big portions--two of us split a cold appetizer (muhammara), a hot appetizer (tartare borek), and an entree (bamia), and couldn't finish some yummy desserts. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this resto for months. Do yourself a favour, and go! I'm Armenian so I'm very familiar with Syrian food and have variations of it quite often. But Damas is on a whole other level. It's elevated Syrian food. More refined. We took the tasting menu and left with our pants unzipped but it's totally worth it. The flavours are just so surprising and on point. I love pomegranate and was delighted that it made appearances in a lot of the dishes. The fattouche was the best one I've ever had. Better than my mom's (don't tell her I said that). Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience.....I think this pretty much sums it up!!! From the dips to the meat platters. Everything was 5 stars.....can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the tasting menu, which was absolutely inspired. If I had to recommend one dish, it would be the fattoush (you might be skeptical because it's a salad, but truly, it's other-worldly). Can't recommend this place enough. Absolutely one of the most unique and delicious meals I've ever had."}
{"text":"Acaba steak ya da iyi bir hamburger mi yeseydik dedik ama iyi ki de gelmi?iz. Müthi? lezzet. ?stanbul dakiler kadar iyidi. 

Great. Perfect...."}
{"text":"Delicious Syrian cuisine with exquisite presentation. We ordered the 5 choice starters and a salad. Then we shared a chicken and a lamb dish. We also tasted the dumplings. A must have. Everything was just great. 
The outside terrace is beautifully decorated and lighted. The service was friendly but yet professional. A wonderful place to spend a perfect summer evening."}
{"text":"I've been twice recently and both meals have been excellent. One time, I had the tasting menu. Absolutely fabulous - but arguably too much food. A very reasonable price though. The other time, a friend and I went a la carte and also left stuffed. My favs: (1) grilled cheeses, (2) warm octopus salad, (3) smoked eggplant dip, (4) grilled lamb. But everything I tried was generally good. Love their date \"juice\" w nuts as well. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Damas. I've got only love for you. So. On a cold cold night of January we had a reservation at 9 pm at this wonderful, warm, inviting, packed of clients restaurant. As soon as you enter you forget the cold weather. The decor is classy, not too much, not m'as-tu vu, just the right amount of coziness and style. We sat at one of the bar, they have 2, I love eating at the bar, and could see the cooks grilling, prepping and treating food with all the love it deserve. After getting all the informations we needed about the menu we decided to go big with the Menu degustation. For 75$ per person you get to share 9 mezzes and a main course. My friend is gluten intolerant and they were very accommodating abt it. They even asked if there's some mezze we would like to have more than others. It's the very first time that I have a say in the degustation menu items. It's a big plus. Everything we had was just fantastic: fatouch, eggplant moutaball, beets moutaball, kybbe (cooked one not the tartar), filet mignon, octopus salad, muhammara, fried cheese, so much delicious that I have forgotten the last mezze we had...but I can assure you it was good that's all I remember. For the main course (yeah it's not over yet) we shared the rack lamb. Goodness. Heaven. Hallelujah. The meat was so tender, grilled to perfection and perfectly marinated. I almost cried. It came with grilled veggies and an eggplant salad. The sides were perfect too: light and flavourful. Finally, yes, no judgement please, we had desert  a wonderful baklava: just sweet enough and crispy like it should. It was a very nice way to finish this amazing meal. Now the alcohol. They have a very good wine list, I think it's private importation. Anyhow I drank cava all night and my friend rum and Coke. Oh yeah, we had shooters too. Go figure. The service was brilliant: everybody that works there were smiling and helpful. Really I can't ask for more. You need to go."}
{"text":"Such an incredible find. My boyfriend now loves Syrian food. The stuffed eggplant was one of the greatest items on the menu. The basterma sandwiches were ridiculously amazing. We're not from Montreal but when we come back, we will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants i have ever been .!!!
I have been there 3 times and it has always been consistent Very good Service and food!!! OMG.
I have been a la carte and i have had the tasting menu .. and honestly i couldn't say which one is the way to go ...  other than visit twice and have them both!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as we sat down they offered us water. After I chugged it down, they immediately refilled it. Now that's service!
Make a reservation in advance because the place is packed!
The restaurant is nicely decorated. It's Syrian food and decoration. 
The fattouche salad was a good, sizable appetizer. Good to share. 
I got the Maqlouba chicken. My hubby got the kabab d'Alep (lamb). Both were so flavorful and delicious. And good portion sizes. 
Wine was a nice addition to the meal. 
I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Nicely decorated restaurant serving authentic very tasty middle eastern food. Went multiple times and everything I tried was excellent. Offers a nice terrace to enjoy in summer too. 
I personally preferred it when it used to be a smaller restaurant on Parc ave as it had a more cosy atmosphere, and I find the platters were larger. I currently find it very pricey for a small portion. Quality and taste are still top notch, you won't be disappointed with anything you order."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. Great decor, terrific service and awesome food. Everything was wonderful"}
