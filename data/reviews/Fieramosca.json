{"text":"Went there on a late Saturday to try the tiramisu. I'm a tiramisu lover & on a quest to find the best one in the city. Theirs is quite good, but a tad too creamy and sweet for me. I prefer a stronger taste. The servers were really nice & the place is quite cosy."}
{"text":"Just a nice friendly place to enjoy dinner.  The place is small but the service was great and the food was well prepared and presented.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Had the special which was delicious, but tried the bolognese and risotto also incredible! Not to mention a great wine selection! Must come back!"}
{"text":"This place has real Italian food.  My wife had seafood linguini, I had the veal piccatta. Both dishes were tasty, hot and well presented by a superb server Paul. The owner is a very lovely woman who is enthusiastic about her business and her customers. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very cozy, good staff and excellent service. Pricey though."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Toronto and the staff make it feel like home from the moment you walk in the door!! Fieramosca makes a night out a truly special occasion Gracia"}
{"text":"Can only agree with many of the other reviews - the food is great and the service is excellent! They are professional and friendly - it's amazing. We had starters, mains and dessert and were rolling out of there because we were so full ;-) The owners girlfriend even brought us a dessert on the house - just because she wanted us to try it! The Limincello to finish of the evening was the perfect little treat in the end!"}
{"text":"Given the abundance of mediocre and over priced restaurants in this neck of the woods, it's great to have a place that serves good standard fare with service to boot. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is old school here. A very good choice for Italian overall."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing - food, wine, ambiance. It's certainly cozier in the winter time, but summer opens up two patios. Salads are always fresh, pasta is delicious, fish always grilled perfectly. It's classic and simple Italian food at its finest."}
{"text":"Food was fine service slow and wine served to warm - understand if the restaurant was full but it wasn' t."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place, I've been with 3 different friends and every time it's exceeded our expectations. The waiter Edwin is a master of hospitality, he is always available and there when you need him and has the discretion to know when to let you visit without interruption. The other staff were also friendly and professional.   The chef is brilliant, everything we had was delicious and it was no problem to make special requests and is accommodating of allergies. I highly recommend the hazelnut chicken the flavours, texture and sauce are amazing! I did find the portions to be larger than I can eat which the waiter happily wrapped up for me to bring home. However, I have asked for smaller portions when I have other plans after, because the food is just too good to waste. Also the wine menu is extensive and impressive."}
{"text":"It's like a house turned restaurant. Feels cramped when you're waiting for a table at the front, but when you actually get seated, it feels really comfortable.  The service is laid back and friendly. The menu is Italian and extensive. My favourite is that any of the fish dishes come in several ways: steamed, grilled or whole. If you love fish, this is your joint for sure."}
{"text":"This is one of the best resturaunts I have ever been to. The ministrone soup is amazing, the Caesar salad is wonderful the chicken parmigian is the best I've ever had. If your looking for authentic Italian food that is prepared very well with very fresh ingredients this is the spot. The hotel I stayed at the intercontinental had a list of resturaunts nearby. When I went back i couldn't wait to tell them they need to put this resturaunts at the top of there list it's a hidden jewel. ServiceFive star food  if there's a six star this is it. Ps the tiramisu ahh you won't find better !!"}
{"text":"A++++  service and the food was absolutely delicious!   I have a shellfish allergy and they were very accommodating to that as well.  I couldn't decide between two of the pasta dishes, so the server said he would gladly make me a combination of the two - whatever I wanted.   The atmosphere was so intimate and lovely. I would definitely eat here again!   Thank you for making our anniversary such a special evening :)"}
{"text":"The food was OK, I got pappardelle and my wife had linguine, but service was really bad. The waiter wouldn't allow me to even ask a question and would grab the menu while I wanted to ask a question from it. He did that twice which was really a rude behaviour from him."}
{"text":"Holy Hidden GEM Batman!!  This place is awesome. Felt like I was in an Italian backyard on the Amalfi coast. The food was authentic italian. The owner and waiter were beyond hospitable. They were funny and eager to please.   I was with a group of 6 and everyone said their meal was one of the best by far. I had the Pappardelle in white wine sauce. SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"A cozy little restaurant tucked away on the boundary between the Annex and Yorkville, Fieramosca does the classic trattoria style as well as I've seen in this town.  The food is delicious and the service is great.    While unfortunately a little too pricey to be a regular stop for me, I have to say that my experience there last year for a work function was wonderful.  Booking the reservation was a breeze and all we had to do was show up.  Within minutes we were sitting at our table and enjoying bread and drinks as we perused the menu.  We ordered a few pizzas as an appetizer (it was a large group).  The bomba (sausage and peppers) was tasty and the quattro stagioni (artichokes, mushrooms and prosciutto) was out of this world.  The crust was thin and crisp and the toppings were fresh tasting and flavorful.  For my main course, I had the Scallopina Hotel De Paris, which is a fancy name for veal, salmon and veggies in a tasty piccatta style sauce.  Some of the other people with me had equally delicious dishes, some of which I tasted, but for the life of me I can't remember which ones.    The service was remarkable, our waiter was quite doting and helpful to answer questions or bring us more bread, wine, etc.  Our water glasses and drinks were regularly topped up, to the point where it seemed to be happening all on its own.  We had delicious coffee and some of us had dessert, and then we all rolled out of the cozy restaurant into the chilly night in full-on food comas.  A great restaurant for special occasions, I hope to go back again soon."}
{"text":"A great place to bring a date and also a really great spot for a group reservation.  We were a group of 10 and were seated in the upstairs room.  Food was excellent and they were very accommodating.  I would recommend this for both a romantic evening for couples as well as for group functions."}
{"text":"Went to Fieramosca for my daughter's birthday lunch.  Great location on Prince Arthur Avenue as we were going to the Hyatt after for spa treatments.   It is a very short walk from the hotel.    Beautiful setting, quiet.  I had a salad (very big portion), salmon and vegetables.  I am very particular about how my food is prepared and they got it perfect.  My daughter had the caprese salad and kalamari.  We absolutely loved our meals.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful in making suggestions and informing us about the specials of the day.  The bruschetta they bring out is delicious.    This was our first time at this restaurant and we loved it.  Good portions, friendly service, lovely ambiance.  Would recommend this for an intimate meal with friends or family.  We will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my sisters,  we had the ossobuco on risotto delicious, tiramisu  for dessert fabulous.  Flo is a great host, atmosphere is friendly and warm. Highly recommend, I will go back soon."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is the best. I've been coming for years and I've never once been disappointed even a little bit. The food is quality, understated, excellent. But I love the staff. The waiters are the nicest, kindest, most interesting. Ask them about themselves-- such intriguing lives."}
{"text":"Always good. Amazing service. Everything is stellar and if you want something specially made, or have particular tastes - ASK! They are so accommodating."}
{"text":"Came here with some high expectations and it did not disappoint. Rarely have I seen pappardelle offered anywhere but Little Italy, and amazing cooked at that. The setting is extremely graceful and beautifully designed. Only reason it's not a 5-star is because their command of meat was not quite perfect. I must give them credit for cooking the rack of lamb beautifully (I see less of that nowadays unfortunately) but the seasoning for the other meat in my dish didn't quite hit the spot. But regardless, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fieramosca proved a lovely capstone to a lovely anniversary vacation.  We knew we'd chosen well from the bread basket and bruschetta.  It was just upwards from there.  The atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, seating us despite failing to find our reservation.  Our waiter, after reporting the specials, also winkingly let us know the house does an excellent Caesar salad not found on the menu.  He was right.  All the dishes were good, but my wife insists her spaghetti alle vongole deserves special praise, generously loaded with clams.  The red velvet cake was perfect, striking the balance between moist and not-too-dense.  Unlike the steak house we visited the night before, Fieramosca delivers on its prices.  Friendly to new guests, I suspect it truly delivers to regulars.  We wish we lived close enough to test that hypothesis.  An excellent restaurant for an upscale date."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Trattoria Fieramosca Cuisine: Italian Location: The Annex Address: 36 Prince Arthur Ave Price Range: ~$25 and up  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Extra information:  * Open for lunch * Only open for dinner on weekends  I could never give up a chance to find a perfect Italian restaurant. Yes, I love my reliable Terroni or a hidden gem on Elm street, Donatellos. But if there are more out there, I am willing to take the risk and venture out to find a better one.  Trattoria Fieramosca is hidden away, located on 36 Prince Arthur Ave which is one block north of Bloor street. I could have had never heard or found this place on my own if someone didn't recommend it to me. Trattoria Fieramosca is a house on it's own, giving it a real Italian home feel even before you walk into it.  Once you walk in, it is designed to welcome you with a 'dining at home' attitude. There are seating on first and second floor, as well as the amazing roof top balcony.  Because it was such a beautiful day out, I decided to try out the roof top balcony (I know, I usually never sit outside! I love my AC). With 4~5 round tables and the fountain in one corner, it definitely did not feel like I was in Toronto.  Once we sat down,  we were given a bread basket with white and multigrain bread as well as one piece of bruschetta. Tomato was cold and fresh tasting with chopped up basil and it was very refreshing overall, but the bread was a little tough. Nonetheless, it was a nice start to a meal.   Ordered: Carpaccio Di Alba 3/5  * Marinated beef thinly sliced and served with arugula, parmigiano and olive oil for $16 * Their appetizers are quite big in portion so this dish accompanied by some bread, could be a meal for someone * I found the beef to be a little too thick for Carpaccio style * Perhaps due to the cut of the beef, it was kind of tough * Since the beef was already marinated, it was a little on the salty side with parmigiano cheese and caper * I would have preferred some more arugula so that the saltiness could have been balanced out * Even with the lemon sprinkled on top, this was one of the heaviest Beef Carpaccio I've ever tasted * They were very generous with parmigiano shaving on top, I love parmigiano cheese!!  Ordered: Insalata Di Prosciutto Di Parma Con Aceto Balsamico Di Modena 4/5  * Spring salad with prosciutto di parma and wild mushrooms balsamic vinegar for $13 * Portion wise, this is definitely bang for your buck * This came with 3~4 different types of mushroom on top * If you love mushrooms, you will love this salad * Prosciutto was fried just like bacon (it tasted like bacon too) and sprinkled on top * Again, they were very generous with the amount of Prosciutto * This made the salad really salty even with the salad mix and mushrooms * I picked off some of the prosciutto and had the rest and it was delicious  Ordered: Spaghetti Alle Vongole 5/5  * Spaghetti served with fresh Manila clams in white wine, olive oil and garlic for $24 * As I've said before, this is my favorite type of pasta * It is simple with clean flavors and the quality heavily depends on few ingredients like pasta and clam * This was huge in portion, by now I caught on with their huge portion style * There was a lot of clams on top and they were pretty decent in size * Every single one of them were open (fresh) and none of them were empty * Spaghetti was cooked al dente which I love and they didn't hold back on garlic * Although this was just seasoned with garlic, olive oil, juice from the clams plus salt and pepper- it was bursting in flavor * They didn't offer any cheese for pasta, but it was unnecessary anyways * Make sure to mix well before eating since all the sauce is on the bottom   Ordered: Spaghetti Di Mare Alla Mario 4/5  * Spaghetti with squid, mussels, clams and shrimps in a tomato or white wine sauce for $24 * This is basically the same thing as the one above but with different seafood * If you are not too crazy about clams and prefer to have variety, this would be a good choice for you * They did not hold back on seafood- they were all fresh and delicious  Summary: For sitting outside on a roof top balcony, the service was quick and friendly. Do keep in mind that the food is big in portion but I guess that's Italian food for you. I recommend making reservation since it can get quite packed for dinner time and I will definitely be back to try some other items off from their menu."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto.  Food and service are exceptional. Didnt have a reservation but was there early enough to get a table. Cozy atmosphere, they have a nice patio area as well Its moderately priced ($25-40 avg CAD) but definitely worth a visit.  You pay for quality and this was well worth the $$$ stars."}
{"text":"I had another great experience at this restaurant. The seafood pasta was excellent. It was fresh and hot. The tomato sauce had zing and was both sweet and savoury. The service was also excellent and they were willing to offer anything we wanted to eat whether or not it was indicated on the menu."}
{"text":"When seeing this place had 4.5 stars we were excited about our evening. Unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations. Service was slow. We had a booking and waited to be acknowledged at the door but then had to initiate contact to be seated. This continued. Had to request a waiter's attention to order drinks, then to order a starter and again to order our mains. Tedious! Food was nothing special either or memorable. Very disappointing. The house and setting is nice though, old school Italian, comfortable and friendly."}
{"text":"Where have you been hiding all my life?! Great old school food. I ordered a seafood grill, and it was delicious.   And the decor is rather dated as well.   Notes: Service-wise this ain't no Buca.......i.e. was asked to go to the street to grab a cab when I asked for one to be called (and yes we did manage to get one).....but you don't pay Buca prices either. Could've served balsamic & olive oil w/bread, but didn't.  Will repeat! Great place for a quick and delicious meal without leaving a hole in your wallet."}
{"text":"Spectacular food, service, and location. A block away from all the noise, yet still is cozy and welcoming. The carpaccio and veal scallopini I had were wonderful, as was the Barbera on the wine list. I cannot recommend highly enough; make sure to ask for Giancarlo though, he's fantastic."}
{"text":"If I could eat this food every night without getting fat or going broke I would. Everything I tried was DELICIOUS! I ordered the Prosciutto with Melon appetizer, the Ricotta Gnocchi, and a Lemon Sorbet for dessert and received a nice bruschetta & bread appetizer while I waited for my food. I had heard that the portions could be small but I did not see this for myself. Appetizer was a huge amount of melon topped with quite a few perfectly thin slices of ham (of which I'm proud to say I ate every bite of). The gnocchi was perfectly prepared and the ricotta inside was revolutionary and delicious - I took almost a whole portion to go as it was very filling. I mustered up all of my appetite to order dessert and I'm so glad I did. Lemon sorbet was absolutely perfect and was adorable served inside a lemon. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The italian waiter(may be manager of this restaurant) was not really LGBT friendly. I saw how polite  of him serve other customers, but not us. We went there at Valentine's Day, come on, you said happy valentines day to every customers except us?! Not even we paid you a fat tip?  Food was good nothing standout. I appreciate the bruschetta they offered before the meal."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  But what really sets this restaurant apart , besides the elegant yet warm and inviting surroundings is the service.  After we order off-menu, which we were encouraged to do (\"What do you feel like eating, we'll make you anything you want\"), comes Minnie with a bottle of Limoncello and a couple of glasses.  Eating here feels like you're a guest in someone's home, and after a couple of visits, it feels like you're having dinner in the home of your really good friend.   This is when dining out, feels like dining in."}
{"text":"Went here for a wedding dinner/reception and all the food that was served was absolutely amazing. Probably the best Italian food I've ever had (aside from being in Italy of course). The shrimp and artichoke heart salad as well as the Caprese salad were delicious. The meal then followed with penne pasta and gnocchi which were both very filling. I did feel that the gnocchi had a bit too much truffle oil though as it was a bit over-powering for the rest of the dish. Finally, the main course. I had the Lamp chops. These were amazingly delicious and I could've eaten them for days if I hadn't been so full from everything else.  All in all, I highly recommend this place! It was delicious and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Heading out to the ROM for FNL with friends, we wanted some hearty, not to mention tasty, food before our evening out. We were all running a little late, but they held our reservation. I arrived first; our table was at the back and ready. Not a large restaurant as it used to be a home. Classic features and comfortable chairs. So far, so good.   The rest of our party arrived and our fabulous server was there to take our orders. Another server brought over a complimentary slice of bruschetta while we waited. Mmmmmm. He brought our drinks, a fresh bread basket and went over the specials. They sounded so good, I crumbled and ditched my original choice for the Stuffed Gnocchi with Mushrooms and Sundried Tomatoes in a Rose Sauce($22). My friends ordered Spaghetti Mare Di Mario(seafood in spaghetti for $25), Salisiccia E Quaglia Alla Griglia(4 types of meat for $28) and Bomba Pizza(cheese, green peppers, sausage, onions for $18).    After the bruschetta and trying to abstain from eating a whole loaf of bread, the food arrived. Hot and smelling amazing. After we were all done taking photos of each other's food, the table fell silent as we dug in. After we all tasted our food, we proceeded to share it. SO good. Healthy portions allowed us to share it without any of us feeling guilty. Everyone agreed my Gnocchi was to die for. The pizza was perfect; thin crust and lots of toppings. The 4 meat dish was polished off. All meats were seasoned perfectly. The seafood pasta had a heap of pasta under those clams!   We were all so full, dessert wasn't even an option. The wine list was delightful. They offered perfect wines to compliment any meal Fieramosca has to offer.    Service was excellent. Great timing, didn't abandon us, but didn't bug us. Décor was classic and it didn't feel crowded even though it's a smaller space.    A great start to the evening! Full and ready to continue our night out!"}
{"text":"We held an 18 person party in the 2nd floor private room- Fiermosca outdid themselves, everything about dinner was perfect- location, service, food.  Food is simple but with really fresh ingredients.  Not fancy but tasty.  I have never had a server as outstanding as Giovani.  He even gave us a chef coat for my son when jack soaked his shirt (and oops we had no back up). I said I would return it and he said \"no keep it- maybe one day jack will be a chef and this is his first coat\"!  The whole night was like that.  Hats off to Fiermosca for a stellar night!"}
{"text":"The building itself is an old house, and it felt very much like eating at the exquisite home of some very warm Italian family. The staff were kind, attentive but not hovering, and very easy to chat with not only regarding the menu but also in terms of small talk and general friendly conversation. We told them we had just gotten married a few days before and they allowed us to sit up on the top balcony by ourselves. It was incredibly romantic to just have the one table to ourselves up there with the red checkered table cloth and the chilled bottle of chardonnay, and a really unforgettable first date night as a married couple. Many thanks to the staff there for creating this experience for us. The food was excellent and we left very full and very satisfied. We live just up the block and will be making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"This is literally the best restaurant i've ever been to in my life. I always order the 'Fusilli Delizia' and try and switch up my appetizers but always end up loving 'Funghi Saltati.' The people working here are the nicest ever and always feel so welcome walking in. Can't recommend it enough. Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Its a homely little Italian place with decent food and good, if a little distracted service.  I had the wild mushrooms in white wine sauce as an appetiser.  This was delicious.  My main course of Pappardelle Fieramosca (pappardelle with shrimps in a tomato and white wine sauce) was good, but not exceedingly memorable.    The memorable bit was the tiramisu.  Deee-lishus.  Pity I had to share it ;-)  Worked out at roughly $170 for two - which seems a little pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"yum. pasta carbonara. yum. i'm always searching for a good pasta carbonara. the best i've had was in florence, it's kind of tough to beat. but fieramosca definitely provided me with their best version. at first glance the restaurant looks tiny, but there's the main dining room, an outdoor patio, upstairs dining, and an upstairs outdoor patio. service was a little slower than what i'm used to, but hey no worries. overall the food, company, and ambiance were all really good."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, great service, old school upscale Italian. What else do you need? Im not gonna write a long ass review but this place is great and I love the real Italians that work there. As I said above: great food, atmosphere and service, don't know what else I can say. Plus they have valet."}
{"text":"Great place to have a cozy, delicious Italian meal. The seafood risotto special was very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing atmosphere, even spoke with the owner and she was very pleasant. Would highly recommend for some good home cooked Italian food. I ordered the scallopini veal, boyfriend had linguine and both were done perfectly!"}
{"text":"A fabulous restaurant experience to finish up our trip to Toronto!  Upon seeing reviews on Yelp, we headed to Fiermosca on our BixiBikes only expecting to have a tasty dinner.  It never occurred to us we would need reservations!!  However, our waiter was happy to seat us with the understanding we were limited to one hour as the place was definitely getting busy.  We were seated right next to the fire and our waiter was genuinely wonderful!  We ordered the Arugula fig appetizer special, Lamb chop entree, and Linguini di mama Netta.  Our waiter brought bruschetta to us after ordering and shortly after they brought bread, too.  Plenty of food, no doubt!  We also enjoyed a glass of Chianti.  While it was very tasty with the bread and salad, once our entrees arrived the flavors changed and we didn't like it as much, BUT maybe we should have finished it sooner ;)  The Linguini di Mama Netta was good--I liked the lightness of the sauce and the combination of mushrooms, shrimp, and other veggies.  I could have done without the chicken--it lowers the appreciation of the dish (in my opinion, that is).  The lambchops were UH-MAZING.  So tasty and made both of us very pleased we made the trip to Yorkville.  The place was full and we had reached our hour...we closed our bill and I asked our waiter for suggestions of dessert/coffee spots.  He laughed and instructed us to make our way to the bar.  I'm not sharing all of our details because our experience was very special---and one that I'm not sure happens to every guest, BUT Fiermosca was the best choice we made on our Toronto trip.  We enjoyed a few laughs with the owner and his staff, enjoyed his \"I threw the leftovers together\" dessert, as well as the Tiramisu (YUM!).  Yelpers, it's a no-brainer.  I don't give a 5 too easy--check it out.  BUT make a reservation ;)"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for dinner  while in Toronto for the weekend and must day what a great little place with great Italian food, great selection of wine and amazing service.  The place is small but that adds to experience.  When we called to make reservations, they only had 5:30 or 9p reservations available and it was well worth waiting till 9p and not going somewhere else.   If you are in the area, you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"A tasteful atmosphere offering patio options,  as well. Although the food was delicious,  the restaurant is horribly understaffed.  Cocktails that never arrived,  cancelled appetizers and a final bill which needed to be corrected several times.      The limited servers are polite except for the one who calls himself a runner and refuses to acknowledge anyone since his only job seems to be pouring water.  I'm a fan of good food and atmosphere and while this place offers those things,  I simply cannot endorse a restaurant that cannot provide the full experience.  This is our second visit here with the same delayed service.  Owners may think they are making money by reducing overhead staff expenses but when you consider the losses from cancelled dishes,  unserved drinks and customers who won't return, having additional waiters is an investment which will pay for itself in the long run."}
{"text":"Molto Bene! Great food, great service, lovely decor. The tiramisu was creamier than what we are used to. They also offered our child a complementary chocolate gelato. How cool is that? We will definitely go back to this place & recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner with my mom on a weeknight after catching a fashion show in Yorkville.  We weren't super starving when we arrived so we each opted just for a main. I ordered a delicious glass of sparkling rose which was lovely.  For my entree, I had the mushroom pasta and it was so good. My mom had the veal piccata and loved it. Service was polite and just attentive enough.  Want to come back to try more dishes and some dessert!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. We got there, walked in, and the waiter told us that the wait would be ten minutes for a seat, but probably less. Sure enough, two minutes goes by and a table is ours. They bring out some bruschetta and it was the best bruschetta I've ever had. Then they give our table a little basket of bread and man that was some good bread. The selection of beers was really great, so I've heard. Food comes around and I got the Fussili Delizia and I wish I could eat nothing but that for a long time, because that was extremely good. And for the prices of the food there, you get a lot of food. I'm a growing young adult with one of those famous endless college stomachs, and it filled me up.  Now here's the best part and the thing that amazed me the most about this place. We got the check, and while that was going on, we were talking with our waiter (who was incredibly friendly) about good places to go and things to hit in Toronto. We happened to mention where we were heading next and to see what he thought of it. We pay for the bill and head out. We're around the corner and half a block down and we hear someone yell \"Sir!\" We turn around and it's our waiter, who ran up to us to return the hat my dad was wearing and accidentally left in the restaurant. The fact he would leave the restaurant and run around a block just to catch up with us to return my father's cheap yard sale hat is customer service at its finest. The food was great, the atmosphere was great, the customer service was amazing. The only thing I didn't like about this place was how tight the entrance hallway is, but I cannot say a single bad thing about this place."}
{"text":"I went out for a nice dinner with some family here one evening. The staff is incredibly nice. It probably didn't hurt that my father is Italian and he spent a good portion of the evening chatting up the waiter. He told us not to bother looking at the menu and that he would have the kitchen make whatever we were in the mood for.  The food was good, but a little disappointing given the price. (Given that I'm a student, my opinion on financial matters should be taken with a grain of salt.) That said, still a lovely place to pass an evening!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and my father is used to invite the family here for dinner. All the dishes from grilled vegetables to pasta to desserts are delicious and served in large portions. The waiters are very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Recommended for a group dinner if you have the money to pay for it. The price is definitely justified."}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant is an old house - it definitely has that feeling!  The main dining room at the back is filled with tables - a bit too crowded for my taste, but not annoyingly so.  There is also a patio in the back but I believe they have closed it for the season.  The lights are dim, the room has that old world in your grandma's eclectic house feel to it.  The service was just lovely - our server (name I have forgotten unfortunately) was pleasant and FUNNY!  He cracked jokes with us throughout the service which I found nice after a long shitty day at work.  Definitely an extra star for the service.  I ordered the shrimp and mushroom pasta in an olive oil sauce - Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta - this was pretty ok - light and fresh tasting which is what I wanted since I didn't want a heavy cream sauce when I was going dancing later - that would have put me to sleep!.  My only complaint was that the shrimp to mushroom ratio was off - there were only 3-4 shrimp in my dish and it was overloaded with mushrooms.  The portion was pretty big (for me) - enough for 2 meals.  I'd like to check this place out in the summer when the patio opens up!  Overall the food is about a 3 STAR, but the service bumps it to 4 STAR."}
{"text":"My aunt lives a few blocks away so when I meet up with her for dinner, we often go here. They know her name and reconize me there and we call it our \"Moonstruck\" restuarant (if you haven't seen this movie, rent it now!!) I love their gnocchi quattro fromagi (please pardon the spelling) and I've had their Spegetti carbonara a few times and loved it as well. Their patio is amazing, fairly lights statues, and despite being near two bars, its so quiet. The staff treats us amazingly and I adore their tiramisu. Definately a great place for a date (a bit pricy) but the atmosphere is quiet and enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but what I really loved about this place is the atmosphere and service. Service was very attentive and courteous, and the patio is beautiful and intimate. Perfect place for a date!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The food is very fresh and flavorful.  They use the best of everything in their ingredients.  It is a very welcoming and unpretentious place and the manager, Edwin, is uber friendly and knowledgable.  He takes the time to suggest the most ideal way of ordering dishes and treats you with the utmost care.  This is definitely a place that I would revisit when I find myself in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Cozy, classy atmosphere...idyllic little back patio...wonderful Italian cuisine...prompt and friendly service. How have I never been here before?  If the weather cooperates, I recommend sitting out back on the patio, which is bathed in leafy greenery and accented with a full-sized Greek statue. Very pretty!  Before the meal as we sipped on cocktails, they offered us delicious complimentary bruschetta and a plate of olives and cheese. Very generous indeed.  For an appetizer, I recommend the sauteed shrimps in a tomato cream sauce. Delish.  For my entree I chose the \"Hotel De Paris\" which is an unusual combination of veal piccata (veal scallopini served with a lemon/butter/white wine sauce) alongside slices of grilled salmon, accompanied by grilled veggies. Wonderful dish!!  My companion ordered a lamb special, cooked with arugala and parmesan cheese, which was also lovely.  Looking for a quality, romantic night out? This is it!  P.S. We used the valet parking for the restaurant directly across the street from Fieramosca. As long as you pay them (it's $12) I don't think they care."}
{"text":"This is a real gem of a place to go for Italian, easy to get to via TTC it's just steps from St George subway station. Food here is always on point I have never had a bad meal in the years of getting food here. Staff are super friendly, I don't know what to recommend as everything is good you will not get a bad meal here no matter what you order."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this restaurant. The food was fresh but not wow  We ate: - complimentary Bruschetta:(4/5) hit the spot, but difficult to eat - Green salad: (3/5) generic arugula salad - Pizza with anchovies: (5/5) SO GOOOOODDDDDD and cheesy - Olive oil pasta: (4/5) fresh and simple - Sea bass:(3/5) expensive and mediocre  While the decor is homey and very Milan-like,  the experience was not very special or unique."}
{"text":"High hope bc of high rating from all the other yelpers. We ordered a special seafood spaghetti and lamb chop.  Why is it special seafood spaghetti?  It is because it included half lobster and crab legs tonight in the spaghetti!  Honestly, there are lots of seafood in the plate, but I would prefer more tomato sauce.  On the other hand, the lamb chop is very good!  Lamb meat is very tender.  At the end of the dinner, the restaurant provide free dessert, which is very nice!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 Decor: 3 Service: 2  1. FUNGHI SALTATI, 12 Lightly sautéed cremini, King oyster and shiitaki mushrooms dressed with fresh herbs, served on a toasted baguette, topped with brie cheese ~Okay. Mushrooms with brie were tasty, although it was borderline too salty.  2, LINGUINE DI MAMMA NINETTA Linguine with sautéed porcini mushrooms, shrimps and chicken in extra virgin olive oil and garlic sauce ~Okay. Portions were too big, and it was overall a bit too heavy. Needed something to balance it out.  Service was really poor. It took a long time before they came back for my order, and then I was ignored after serving my entree. I had to walk up back into the restaurant to get my bill."}
{"text":"Just around the corner from the Park Hyatt Toronto, it was very conveniently located.  The ambiance was lovely - very warm and intimate.    My friend and I decided to share a dinner, and ordered soup separately.  I ordered the minestrone soup, which was delicious and very hearty!  My friend got the Tortellini in brodo, which she really enjoyed.  The soup on its own was enough for dinner, what with the lovely bread.    Then we got our entree - Pappardelle Fieramosca; thick noodles with mushrooms and shrimp.  The kitchen was kind enough to split it for us and seriously, each half portion was equivalent to a regular portion!!  Wow!  Its was very good!  The waiter made a small mistake on our check, which was easily corrected, but offered us a tiramisu on the house for our trouble.  Light and fluffy!  I don't usually like tiramisu, but this one was delicious.  If you are in the mood for authentic Italian, then definitely try out Fieramosca!"}
{"text":"Simple delicious food, nice atmosphere, great service, and an overall enjoyable place to dine. I came with a large group and we ate in the private dining area, and was really impressed with the attentive service for such a large party.  The caesar salad was phenomenal, no simple feat for a simple salad that you can find just about anywhere. I swear i could have eaten buckets of this as my entire meal and left happy. Alas, we then moved onto the main course of a breaded chicken and it was delicious as well. Generous serving size and flavoured nicely. For dessert we had tiramisu, which isn't generally my favourite, but this was great. The cream was fresh, bold cocoa flavours, and the consistency was good.  The decor was interesting too, lots of \"treasures\" ie. Paintings, vases, tusks, collectables, etc. It added to the idyllic charm and gave a warm feel to the room. Overall, this was a nice place to dine and i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a special night out."}
{"text":"Best tiramisu ever!!! Had to start by saying that since it had me thinking about their tiramisu for the whole week.   I came here once for dinner as a friend had read good reviews of this restaurant. Food was delicious!!! Service was great!!! It's situated in a little house and so not that very many tables. Definitely recommend making reservations. Food came out in huge portions! We were a group of girls where some of the girls were small eaters so they mentioned they wanted to share their main pasta entree. When the food came, they had already split the pasta dishes for the girls but they looked like they're regular sized portions that you would get at any other restaurant. I ordered their mussels, prosciutto wrapped melon and their daily special which was squid ink seafood pasta which was all delicious!! I didn't think I would have an appetite for dessert but I still ordered the tiramisu since its made fresh daily. Huge portion and it was so good!!!   Would I come back again? Definitely!!!"}
{"text":"When I was here, there was a well to do older man on a date with a pretty, young blonde. I will always remember that, even if it doesn't really pertain to this review. Food and ambiance and wine list receive top score. Great location too. Love Italian food and love this place! Very classy."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Called on Wed at 5:00 and they made arrangements to get us in at 7 for a family of six. Service was great, good wine selection and we had the seafood platter special of the day.  Very flavorful and healthy!  Kids had pizza and gnocchi, also very tasty. Start with grilled calamari.  The place was jammed with many couples but noisy enough that we felt welcome with our kids.  A pricey dinner but expected in this area and for the quality."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out.   The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.  The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.  Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Great staff at this cozy place.  Nice backyard patio in the summertime.   But these guys don't know how to cook a steak  Seriously disappointment with chewing on a piece a leather instead of having my steak the way I wanted, medium rare!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is, particularly at this price point.  I had an uninspired salad and a steak, which was well prepared, but served with boring steamed vegetables.  The decor is also boring and outdated and the service was extremely slow (despite the fact that they weren't busy).  I would go back for dessert though, as the tiramisu was delicious."}
{"text":"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)  Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.  Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.  Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!  Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.    So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.    The food:  Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.  Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.  Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.    Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.    Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.  Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.  Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.  Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!  TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.  2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.  The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!"}
{"text":"Such a great little place!   I went here for a work lunch with some colleagues, and we sat on the (tiny, adorable) back patio. The food was delicious, and they knew we were in a rush so the food came out very quickly.   The place has just the right amount of Italian charm, without going over to the \"cheesy\" side. I love the sculptures on the patio!   It's a little pricey for lunch ($17 for my gnocci in rose sauce with shrimp, around $15 for a pizza), but if someone else is paying... definitely a good stop!   Also, not only did we get warm bread, but also bruscetta! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came here with my office. Lovely spacious area upstairs. Had the risotto, not as good as my roommates', pretty tasty nonetheless.  Pretty decor and classy Mesopotamian music."}
{"text":"Fieramosca is in a nice trendy section of the city. the restaurant is very nice inside and they have a lot of choices for food. I had lobster stuffed ravioli and it was good. The portions were decent but I expect more ravioli from all restaurants I go to. Good wine selection I would go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, the staff are very fun and friendly. The crowd is mostly baby-boomer types and locals who love the food. The decor could be revamped but it's the atmosphere that really sells you. Nice lighting, intimate setting, great date place or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Went back two days later. Same great service, we had pasta, perfectly cooked and tasty puttanesca sauce.  Too much sauce on the pasta for my liking.  Americans seem to expect this, I like it better how they serve it in Italy. Big portion. Split with my husband and with a salad was plenty. Owner sent us after dinner drinks when she realized we were there for 2nd time that week."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved it. The decor looks like the sort of place where Tony Soprano might hang out, but the food is out of this world. Must-try's include the stuffed gnocchi (I'm not a fan of gnocchi in general, but these are special) and the SEAFOOD SALAD. I dream about that lemony, delicious salad frequently.  Will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"This place was beyond disappointing. Service poor and the food avg at best. No idea how this place ever had a 4.5 star review."}
{"text":"Yet another fancy Italian restaurant in Yorkville.  Probably fancy but nothing more than fluff, or so i thought.  I must admit i was quite wrong.  Although the cost to dine there is on a steeper side, i find that it was worth it.   There were plenty of dishes and drinks to choose from.  And on top of that, there were plenty of specials that's off the menu too.  I chose a fish dish from the special (ah hem... doesn't mean cheaper), and i was pleasantly surprised.  The food came in generous portion, and was nicely flavored.  Food presentation was very pretty to look at.  Overall, everyone had the same opinion and enjoyed their food thoroughly.  Service was decent.  The server was polite and attentive, but at the same time gave us space to enjoy ourselves.   Will definitely go back again to try their other dishes."}
