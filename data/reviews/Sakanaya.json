{"text":"Good atmosphere and great dishes! Pretty competitive with fine Japanese ramen place in California"}
{"text":"This place is super trendy, very conveniently located, and always insanely crowded.  The food is alright but more trendy than quality.  The ramen is a little overpriced for the quality you get, and the sushi rolls are decent. My favorite is going for lunch and getting the Hwe Dup Bob, which is sushi rice topped with lettuce, sashimi, egg, crab, shredded radish, vegetables, and fish roe. It's one of the best value items on the menu in my opinion, and one of the healthier options. Left me super full."}
{"text":"My favorable sushi place in Urbana-Campaign. Very fresh and fantasric testy sushies. The friendly stuff and fast enough service. There is only one drawback - sometimes there is queue. But it can be easily explained by all those that I have listed above."}
{"text":"Great Japanese cuisine, especially for Urbana. Ordered the vegetarian ramen and was well made at a decent price. Not a very extensive menu but a good bang for your buck. Would visit again. Lots of Asians come so hopefully that speaks well about how traditional it is"}
{"text":"Waited for 30 minutes only to find out my name was never in the waitlist while I clearly received confirmation text msg. The receptionist did not even apologize for her mistake and insisted that she didn't remember us coming in while all these time we were sitting right next to her. I have been here A LOT since this place opened but their service has clearly been declining."}
{"text":"Best rolls in champaign! For a good price too! Service is prompt. Wait can be pretty long (15-25 mins) during peak hours but it is worth it. I recommend the play girl rolls and spicy tonkasu ramen. Udon is good too. A must try!"}
{"text":"Sakanaya is a new sushi restaurant that opened up a couple months ago. You'll notice that it looks out of place because the front looks like it's made out of wood. But as you walk in, the decor makes it look like any downtown restaurant. The interior is small but they make use of every bit of space while making it still look open. My girlfriend and I decided to visit it last Saturday.  When looking at the menu, you'll notice that it's just 3 pages (another Yelper posted it earlier). You'll see that it has the standard variety of sushi and rolls with a few unique creations. While some may think the limited menu is disappointing, I consider it refreshing. It reminds me of Big Grove Tavern's menu, where it isn't cluttered and highlights tasteful entrees. My only complaint is that most of the entrees are priced above average.  The food, now that's the best part. I've had sushi everywhere in Champaign (Yellowfin, Oishi, Sushi Kame, Ko Fusion, etc.). Sakanaya ranks among the best, as one of the places that serves the freshest and tastiest sushi. I also enjoyed the Champaign/Urbana roll. For those who are new to sushi, the C/U roll and salmon and tuna sushi are good ways to get introduced.   The service was good as well. Our waiter was very attentive. He even gave me free miso soup because he thought I'd be \"left out\" since my girlfriend was getting soup with her entree.   All in all, I'd recommend Sakanaya as an occasional date spot night. It has some of the best sushi in town for a somewhat high price. You can bet I'll be coming back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe this is in Champaign Urbana!  The freshest most creative and delicious sushi imaginable.  Served in beautiful plates in a chic setting.  Even the green tea is exceptional. The only problem is the place is small and there are no reservations.  You have to get there the moment they open or have a long wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service! They have some vegan options as well which was amazing! I got and avocado roll, cucumber roll, and vegetarian ramen which is also vegan! Can't wait to go back and definitely recommend to anyone who love sushi! Little warning though, it gets packed quick so there may be a wait!"}
{"text":"Sakanaya is a true hidden gem for japanese foodies. Best is the Sakanaya and the OMG rolls Great quality sashimi and very attentive service"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have had Jap food in Asia, and in large cities across North America and this place is legit. My favorites are: the Willis Tower (flavour explosion, must get), the gyoza dumplings (great flavour, perfect crisp, delicate in a good way; the sauce that comes with it is a little too 'soy saucy'so I bring my own dumpling sauce), spicy shoyu ramen (I've had better but this was still very satisfying... Full flavour, chewy noodles cooked to perfection, I add extra chili sauce (I bring my own) and the egg is hard boiled which is a shame but not a deal breaker).  I would not recommend the tempura or the wings... Both very heavily battered and a bit too crunchy, not in a good way but still good flavour. You can't go wrong with any of the rolls.... Everything is exceptionally fresh and delicious! Chicken teriyaki is standard and beef bulgogi a little dry but still tasty. The umagi rice dish looks really good just haven't tried it yet. This place rocks... you just can't go wrong here! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale for Green St! Great for a small group of 3-4 or a nice date spot. I went to college that UIUC and unfortunately I found this place my senior year of college... I saw unfortunately because it was the best sushi I had in Champaign and I found it so late!!"}
{"text":"Authentic & freshly prepared asian cuisine. Innovative sushi rolls, the OMG is highly reccomendable!"}
{"text":"It's overpriced for the quality of sushi you get. Most of the rolls are fried but what bothers me the most is tons of rice in nigiri and not much fish."}
{"text":"We've been going to Sakanaya frequently since it opened couple years ago. I like their sushi rolls which have the right amount of rice (some places fail by putting too much rice in sushi rolls) and I think Sakanaya roll, VIP roll and Gold rush roll are worth trying. Hwe dup bap is also a good choice with a lot of vegetables and raw fish. Their pretty tasty food and the fact that there are not enough good Japanese restaurants in C-U still make us come here frequently however I do want to see them making improvements. They really need to change/add new items to the menu. I'm finding myself ordering the same sushi rolls too often just because there's nothing new to try. My most favourite menu item was the tuna tataki but I no longer see it on the menu. Their sashimi is okay and not the best. If you want to have ramen, Sakanaya is still the only acceptable place in town to go to but I have to say their ramen is just mediocre and overpriced. The broth is not flavourful and their ramen eggs are so overcooked that the yolk has a green ring. Ramen eggs are supposed to be soft boiled. You can get much more delicious ramen for the same price in Chicago (for e.g. Wasabi, Ramen Takeya, Ramen-san)."}
{"text":"Worst tekkadon I've ever had in my life. It was so scarcely edible that I have to write down \"unsavory\" with soy sauce on the dish."}
{"text":"Best sushi Ever!!!!!!! Restaurant is clean and modern. Staff is attentive and welcoming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Lots of different rolls to choose from. My favorite entree us the una don. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The sushi is the most tender and delicious I've ever had and the noodles were perfect and plentiful. I only wish this wasn't on campus, because I hate fighting the crowds during the school year."}
{"text":"I did not expect to find such a solid Japanese restaurant in the middle of Illinois. Their sushi and ramen are exceptional. I am always impressed at the freshness and quality of their fish.  The only rub is that they do not take reservations, so you may have to wait a while for a table.   I hear that if you call ahead, you can have your name put on the waiting list."}
{"text":"Sakanaya is very small on the inside, but the atmosphere was nice. However, I wish they had bigger tables instead of making two people sit at one person table because I personally want all my dishes at once but the table did not have room for the other dishes, so that was I a little disappointment.   I ordered I Love Tuna and Salmon Roll. Salmon Roll was amazing and very tasteful! I Love Tuna was okay. The spicy sauce that they added took away the flavor of tuna.   I will definitely go back there but I will not order I Love Tuna anymore."}
{"text":"I love Sakanaya, and I definitely think it is the best sushi on campus! The dine-in experience is great because of the aesthetics of the restaurant and the high-quality sushi. While it usually takes awhile to get a table during busy times, it is well worth it. And the take-out sushi also tastes just as good! I recommend this restaurant to everyone and definitely rank it number 1 compared to other sushi restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi in Chambana can usually leave little to be desired, but Sakanaya was a pleasant change of pace. A bit on the pricier end of Green Street fare, but if you're looking for great sushi, look no further than Sakanaya."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty inconsistent. I basically order the same thing every time (the I love salmon), yet the quality has been different every time. When the place first opened, it was great. The past few times, however, the fish has been served either a little too warm, at room temperature, or too thin, seems like I can see through it. The rice, sometimes, is too hard. The fish is also cut irregularly, sometimes they are a good size, other times, it's really tiny.   The last time I came here, however, it was really good. The portions were just right and the temperature of the fish was good.   There's not too much too complain, just small things that makes this place not completely satisfactory. Overall, still probably one of the better sushi places on campus."}
{"text":"I think this is where we are headed. Sleek, Smart, Clean Restaurant  Design. The Ramen was hot, spicy and savory .  extra TLC. Just the thing to chase away the winter blahs. .......big shareable bowl of comfort.                  The disappointment was in the eel roll. My only  regret:   should have brought it to their attention.  I have had the eel prepared at the Urbana Schnuck's and it was amazing.  My personal observation.......Olivia is the reigning queen of grocery store sushi.  Will I give these kids another try? Sure will"}
{"text":"WOW, best Sushi and Japanese cuisine in Central Illinois hands down. superior quality in every bite even to the best i've tasted in Chicago!"}
{"text":"You can't tell your customers that you would serve them cold food in order to make them go with the to-go option (initially ordered for to go but immediately asked them to seat us)  and not dine in (since it was a busy night), especially when your customers are ready to wait and dine in. The front desk person was new and mentioned we will be served cold food and in a to-go box!!! Instead he could ve just refused our request to dine in. Very unprofessional and unfriendly.  Sakanaya has been one of my favorite places in champaign with very understanding and friendly service so far but this experience is so off-putting. I may come back but I am not sure it would be a favorite place."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly. The price is moderate. The Sakanaya Roll is taaaaaaasty ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!! We ordered about 7 rolls and each one was equally amazing! Plan to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!! No question.  Worth the wait! Worth it all!  Raspberry sake was amazing too!! The signature roll the Sakanaya is highly recommended!!! There are so many good ones tho!"}
{"text":"Really great quality of Sushi, the peach bunny sake was delish. Its a Lil pricy but delish.  I didn't really have a favorite, they were all decent."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good Japanese food! Reasonably priced lunch specials. Dinner is a little more expensive. Sushi is surprisingly good for mid-Illinois, and the ramen and udon are rich and satisfying. Celebrate with Sakanaya :)"}
{"text":"SO and I are looking for a go to sushi place in this barren wasteland called Chambana. And boy did we find one.  The Good: -The Sakanaya roll was salmon, crab salad, avocado on the inside and it was topped with torched scallops and fish flakes. It was extremely good, the fish flakes brought an interesting twist to it, great texture, -Blue-fin tuna sashimi. Our waiter recommended the current special, which was priced at 2.5 per piece. Neither my SO or I particularly like sashimi, but we both loved it, it was fantastic. -The miso soup was just the right amount  saltiness and fantastic flavor. -We also got the Una-Q roll and the Salmon roll, and both were well really well wrapped and delicious. The eel in the Una-Q roll melts in your mouth. -The ambiance! It's exactly what we were looking for, upscale but still casual. Fantastic. -The service is also fantastic! Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable.   The Bad: NOTHING!  Overall: Absolutely fantastic. We will be back again soon, I guarantee it."}
{"text":"Nice and delicate food.  Wanna try the \"I love Salmon\" next time, looks good."}
{"text":"Food is good but not fancy. I have been there several times and  had  unfresh fish once. However, it is still a right place for sushi. Chicken wings are awesome. Sadly, service is not as good as food. One of the waiters always touched my back when he came to the table and I do not like it. I ordered wings to go a night and they took my number. I waited for 40minutes outside and when I came back  I found out that my wings are ready for a long time and a little cold. They told me they would not call me even though they took my number. They took my number just in case I did not show up. I do not understand the logic there. They really need to work on their service to match the good food."}
{"text":"Don't listen to these bozos who are giving this place static.  Sakanaya is absolutely delicious, from the sushi, to the ramen, to the nigiri -- and the service was spectacular.   The wait? Yeah. Big deal. It's dinner at a place people actually want to eat.   The prices? Yeah, decent food actually costs a few bucks, especially when it's served to you and you don't have to bus your own table.   Three cheers for Sakanaya!"}
{"text":"As a sushi-fan, I can say this is a pretty good restaurant near U of I though it may not be better than those near the ocean. The atmosphere here is good and you can have a great time with your friends!"}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here and had a great experience (we will definitely go back)!  We eat sushi a lot, and wanted to try a new place, especially while the students were out of town.  The atmosphere is great (you feel miles away from campus town on the inside)- very nice decor.  Our server and all the staff were great- they brought us an appetizer on the house which was delicious (they came and explained what to do because we looked a little confused- it was a tower of rice, crab meat (I think), and spicy tuna (I think) with sauces and you mix it together- Mmm!  The sushi was great- very fresh and a lot of variety!  We picked from specialty rolls.  I loved the kamikaze and playgirl, and we had about 3 others too- very filling. My boyfriend had the hot sake and I had the peach sparkling sake, and they were both great. Highly recommend going here!  I'm not sure how busy it is when students are around (parking is a little far away as we parked on fifth street at meters, so may be harder when school is in session), but wonderful addition to campus town and sushi places in town!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get avocado rolls in town. They also have a tasty seaweed salad."}
{"text":"I lived in SF for a few years and had lots of sushi. This place is among the best I've had. Definitely worth stopping in and giving it a try.  I had some of the largest and tastiest sashimi I've ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome place, love their food. The staff are always super nice, they're always packed but we always manage to get a table right away. My favorite is their shrimp tempura."}
{"text":"Gotta have a good laugh at the reviews that are posted by people that \"haven't even been there\" yet.  Or those that are flabbergasted that a new, small restaurant with some buzz about it might not have a table open right when you walk in.  Party of seven on the Saturday evening of opening weekend?  Oh, of course.  Luckily some reviews have started to trickle in from people who have a clue what they're talking about.  First trip in we grabbed some gyoza (solid) for the table to get things going, and then a Sakanaya Roll and Emperor's Roll to split, along with some otoro nigiri.  The rolls were great, but this place is packing pretty decent fish, so don't be afraid to go nigiri/sashimi.  With all of the ramen talk, that was gonna be our focus.  Miso and tonkotsu were both well-prepared, with more noodles than we expected and good (but maybe sparse) pork.  My only problem was with the preparation of the egg that's included, which is more of a personal taste thing, as it seemed like a tea egg.  Overall very good.  We just got back from NYC and managed to squeeze in both Ippudo and a hole-in-the-wall hand-pulled noodle place in Chinatown, so I can't say it's the BEST ramen I've had recently, but we grade this shit on a curve based on location, right?    Second time around I went with the pork bul-goki.  Nice spice and well-prepared.  Miso soup was good and the salad was really nice.    Good to see a place like this open up and go all-out on ambiance and storefront design on top of menu.  Would like to see some more options available for the ramen, but that might be something that comes after the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"A nice Japanese/sushi restaurant, and conveniently located for University students. I had the spicy shrimp tempura udon and an Alaska roll. The udon was definitely spicy (as promised), but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the dish. Overall I was very happy with my meal. The ambiance of the place is very nice, but a little too hip for my taste. Lighting is pretty dim and my friend and I had a little trouble figuring out how the water pitcher worked. In the end, though, I think everything about this place comes together pretty well, and it deserves its spot in Chambana's pantheon of great restaurants."}
{"text":"Great place for semi fancy sushi. Its fun to dress up w friends and come here and good place for a first date. Get the fried shrimp roll"}
{"text":"Two stars for the food. I would go for the food but not the service. Not sure why these Japanese or Korean restaurants in Champaign always hire the same type of waiters and waitresses. It was the funniest thing when I saw our waitress glare at my friend and me and spoke to us in a curt and hostile tone. Then we saw her cleaning the table next to us and spoke to a male waiter in a squeaky, girly voice and giggling on top of that.   Sorry, ran off track. The fishes are very fresh. The wings are awesome! I usually go for the lunch specials since they're actually decently priced.   By the way, why do the girls (waitresses) all wear tights as pants there? Didn't know bunnyland existed there too, thought it was only at the gym..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good quality sushi with awesome service and a nice atmosphere look no further. This place is bomb!!! Their chicken wings are the best :)"}
{"text":"When I get the desire to brave the crowded, Keystone light drenched, sports bar filled campus town and get a little hungry, Sakanaya is definitely one of my go to places. Great sushi and great ramen. Kind of expensive but that's what I get for living in the midwest. It's filled with a bunch of modern lighting and furniture, if you're into that sort of thing. And the host takes your name on an ipad so that's like, cool, right?   PS There are better sushi places in town that aren't Ko Fusion."}
{"text":"Very delicious but a little expensive. Nice service!"}
{"text":"I loved every bit of Sakanaya. The moment I stepped inside the restaurant, I liked how the interior was designed. The restaurant is narrow and very long. Everyone working there seemed to be getting along and everyone seemed happy. We were able to get our food fast and even though I am not too familiar with Japanese food, they all tasted amazing. Good food at a good price!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service... A+.  Lee was an excellent server, strongly recommend for a very pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Brilliant. Really took care of our 5 and 6 year old kids. Food was excellent as was the Saki."}
{"text":"Overall, a decent Japanese food restaurant in Champaign. Make sure you make reservations before you go. There is usually a line."}
{"text":"I was in town on business, and a friend of a coworker recommended this place. Usually I wouldn't trust a sushi restaurant that's more that 500 miles from an ocean, but I'm glad I made an exception in this case. Hooray for refrigerated shipping. Everything was splendid. A bit crowded, but still great ambiance."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Chambana. Every time my friends visit I will take them to Sakanaya.   I love the sushi and ramen here and that whatever I choose, Sakanaya never disappoints me"}
{"text":"This is easily the best sushi restaurant in Champaign. Part of that is the fact that it takes you out of Champaign and makes you feel like you're in a real city. The atmosphere is very relaxing and lounge-like. Our waitress was attentive, kind, and down-to-earth. I had the Gold Rush 1848 roll (grilled eel with gold leaf flake on top, gorgeous) and my boyfriend ordered chicken katsu. Both were excellent and we're looking forward to coming back soon! This place presents its food artfully."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. As other reviewers said, be prepared to wait if you didn't make a reservation ahead of time, as the restaurant is very small. They said we would have to wait 30-45 minutes, but it ended up only taking 10-15 so it wasn't too bad.  The quality of the food was very good, but I felt like we were paying more for the atmosphere than the food itself (though, to be fair, the atmosphere was quite nice--definitely a good place for a date if you don't mind it being a little bit on the loud side).  I'd go back, but it's one of those places where I feel like I would need to eat something either before or after to be really satisfied."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last week. The staff was extremely kind and accommodating to my dietary needs! I had the vegetarian ramen, and the waiter suggested that I swap out the pork based broth for a vegetable based one, since I am trying to avoid meat. He said the broth that he was suggesting would probably taste even better than the one that comes in the menu, and it was delicious! He even checked back in to see what i thought. Love this place. Clean, great food, and cozy decor."}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side but the sushi is amazing! I think it's the best sushi place on campus and the interior decor is great"}
{"text":"This place if one of the best food place on campus. It serves great Japanese food. I like its noodles and sushi a lot. And it opens till late night, in school time usually till 1am, which is great because I can then have some late night food with friends. However, to eat here you usually have to wait for a long time for the  queue, like 20-30 minutes. Also, the food are kind of pricy, it can easily go up to 30 dollars if you order two food items. But the price comes with the quality!"}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere and set up of the place. The staff was friendly and attentive. The food is ok but nothing to brag about. Ordered a bunch of rolls and they were done right. Wont hurry back here but would eat here again considering the lack of great options in the area."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. The restaurant is located on the busiest shopping district near the University of Illinois. Parking is not easy but we managed to find a spot in a metered parking garage nearby.   The place is of medium size, modern and clean. We were lucky to get a table rightaway since the place was packed with the lunch crowd that day.  We ordered Willis Tower, an appetizer, and that was good. It was a tower of fish roe, seasoned raw tuna, spicy crab, rice among other things. It was generously portion and it took both of us to consume it, definitely not for a single serving in my opinion.   I ordered 2 special rolls from the lunch menu: 101 and sakanaya special, and both were still good although they were a bit too sweet to my taste. The service was great as our waiter was attentive and nice. Overall this is a great sushi place"}
{"text":"Me and my brother ordered seven dishes and we  asked to be seated at a bigger table but the waitress told us that she cant do it, instead she let us sit at a 1 person table with 2 seats and she didn't even try to help us get a bigger table , it is not comfortable to sit at such small table and order so many dishes. Although i told her that we want all the dishes at once she  ignored the request and brought us each dish by its time, which is absurd since we want to share dishes. We got 1 dish and we canceled the whole other dishes.  Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in CU! Great staff, quick service! Tuna Poke bowl was amazing as well as the I Love Tuna. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I loved it! Super fresh raw fish and lots of flavors. The sushi was extra fresh and the service was insanely quick."}
{"text":"Salmon don and chicken terriyaki was dope. 10/10 would eat again. Also, good miso."}
{"text":"Probably the best place the take someone out for a meal on green street. Quality food and service. There's no other sushi place close to competing against Sakanaya in a five mile radius."}
{"text":"salmon is delicious but don't like the rice they use for entree"}
{"text":"I totally have a soft spot for this place.   Small, yes. But delicious and worth the wait. Love the ramen and seaweed salad. Hot sake is huge for $6. Nick the manager is totally awesome and super attentive to customers. Service is always with a smile. Fish quality in sushi is fresh and better than most places here.   My only complaint is the portion size with the sake don. For $17, expecting more fish. This is basically appetizer size in Seattle. Wish they were open for lunch too."}
{"text":"The decor, service and overall ambience was great and a change from campus life outside but honestly the food was only okay. Don't get me wrong it was enjoyable but especially for the prices I feel as though you pay for the experience rather than the food itself. The ramen was okay--nowhere near as good as authentic Japanese ramen from NYC but not bad."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, especially the Willis tower, but I am not a big fan of the ramen. It is a little too salty for me."}
{"text":"The only item that I've enjoyed in the five times I've been there was the most expensive item there-the sushi plate.  Everything else was... meh.  It lacked flavor and presentation and the service was lacking until you were taken to a table. Even then, it was awkwardly positioned near the kitchen door where it was loud and the doors kept flying open every few minutes.  Our request to be moved was declined.   I'd rather go to Ko Fusion if I'm going to spend that kind of money."}
{"text":"I tried Sakanaya when it fist opened on campus. I thought I would never come again since it's too pricey for me. However, today I came for its Una don and Ramen, totally heaven!!! The salmon nigili is even better than the one I tried in Taiwan! So fresh and tasty. I believe I'll come back soon :)"}
{"text":"Good food and very fresh for the midwest. Lots of waiting though. I haven't been here in a year because there is usually a very long wait and they don't allow reservations."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town and great staff. The wait time can be a little intense, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I visited U of I recently and was looking for a place to eat on green st. since it was within walking distance from my friend's apartment. 4 stars for this place and something I hadn't been to before, sounds good to me. I was a little hesitant though since there were no elite reviews and some of the reviews seem like fakes, but here's mine. Hopefully you can trust me.  I walked in and it looks really nice, nice decorations and everything, just really small. Put our name in and waited probably 20 minutes or so to be seated. People love their sushi on a Saturday night I guess. I recommend calling for a reservation, and don't plan on coming if you have more that 4 people since there's barely enough tables as is.   From what I read, the ramen was pretty good. My friend told me that too and the waiter said that's what they were known for so that sounded good to me. The gf and I both got ramen, forgot what their names were though. We did have different broths though and I liked mine better. Hers was the first one listed and mine was the second. I'm definitely a fan of this. I usually don't like ramen since you can pay 10 cents and make it in the microwave as opposed to paying 13 bucks for this one, but this was good. Meat was even tender and the dish as a whole was pretty solid.  We also ordered a sakanaya roll which was recommended by our waiter. Guess the sushi was backed up since it took a while for it to get out to us. To be honest I wasn't really a fan. Tasted fine but wasn't anything special. It was room temperature, so it just makes me think that it was sitting out for a while, but hey that may be your cup of tea, who knows. But anyway, 4 stars for the ramen dishes pretty much."}
{"text":"The price is acceptable. Chicken teriyaki is just so so. Not as good as I expected. Fresh fish don is good. Champaign rolls are really delicious. Worth trying"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi, and Sakanaya appeared to be the best choice in the Chambana.  We arrived right before they opened for dinner, so we were sat before there was a line. We ordered the seaweed salad as an appetizer. For entree, we got the \"I love salmon\" plate, as we were not very hungry.  Got the seaweed salad, and it seemed like it's just pre-packaged seaweed salad with a cherry tomato on top. Tasty, but not too special.  For the main entree, the salmon plate ( see pic for details). It was good, but not great. Honesty, the best part was the gochujang ketchup they had on the salmon roll.  Sakanaya is relatively good in Chambana, but not great if compared to other places I've been to."}
{"text":"This place was very delicious and overall a great experience. They have very exotic and traditional food! I got sushi and my dad got a sea urchin!! What's really awesome is that all of their fish is wild-caught and not farm raised!!! The place is tiny but very beautiful, clean, inviting and the staff is very nice! We were in and out within an hour, but keep in mind we did get there right when it opened so it wasn't very busy. I've heard that when it's busy you'll be waiting a loooong time. Overall a pretty awesome place!"}
{"text":"I had the Bul-Goki and wow, the flavor was incredible! Can't wait to go back and try something different. Also, I picked up my order and the staff member who helped me provided great service with a smile. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. It's a typical Asian sushi fusion restaurant with nice decor. It is also a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The Sunset Roll was worth the trip alone. Making arrangements online ahead of time is a must."}
{"text":"Really tasty sushi, and the decor is lovely. It's super expensive for Champaign, Illinois, but there's not much to do about it"}
{"text":"Excellent!  It's rare to find good sushi away from the ocean, but they've done it.  Long wait but worth it."}
{"text":"OMG - so stinkin' good! I loved the food here - we had a little of everything...and it was EXCELLENT!! The staff was friendly, the service was excellent. Food was out timely and the place was very clean. The one thing that makes me sad - if you don't get there early - you may have to wait. The place is tiny. BUT - will still be going to eat there again!!"}
{"text":"Love the Willis Tower. Everything goes as expected."}
{"text":"Sakanaya is unique atmosphere.  Has good japanese ramen noodles that are not comparable to any other ramen restaurants in Champaign."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Far enough from campus you feel like you're getting a great dining experience. Great service and even better food!"}
{"text":"Ran out of fatty Tuna way to early in the evening but for Midwest sushi in a small town. Def a good meal. My cold sake was served in a juice box which was interesting but it still was good. They kind of make you feel rushed while you eat or want to move people in and out as fast as possible it feels like. Probably bc the place is very small and still quite new and popular but it would be nice if I felt less rushed through my meal.  Sushi cuts were good but just they ran out of main items way to early in the evening ."}
{"text":"Nice sushi! I love the Champaign-Urbana. The price is a little higher."}
{"text":"Besides the new six-pack dorm building, upgraded computer center in the Illini Union, Panda Express on Green Street, and new dining halls being built AFTER I graduated and thus making me feel like a chump, this restaurant being a new addition to Green Street is the cherry on top! Thanks, U of I, thanks.  If you're a college student taking your girl (or guy) on a hot date and want to impress but don't have a car, THIS is your spot. Make sure you bring $$$$. It's not for the cheap.  It's small, trendy and a bit romantic on the inside. You pass by the sushi bar on the way in with seriously the cutest sushi plush dolls sitting inside the display. Try staring into one and being able to say no to its face.  So, now what?  - Order the Sakanaya roll! Sooo good! - *****Make sure to check in on your Yelp app to get your completely free miso soup***** (which was really good)  Definitely hit up this spot if your wallet allows it!"}
{"text":"The sushi is served at room temperature which is amazing! I especially love their sashimi. It's a little pricy, so definitely don't come here all the time, but I'm so glad they opened this place up!"}
{"text":"Lovely. Best sushi on campus, though the ramen is a bit overpriced. Clean interior, polite staff though a bit of a wait. I recommend the salmon platter for some simple but well executed sushi. The hand roll? Work of art.   Owners are lovely as well, often doubling up as waiters."}
{"text":"Great food for sure. But if you're hungry and looking for a place to fill your stomach, think twice before you choose it. The line can get pretty long late at night.   Or alternatively, you can try to download Nowait. It's their reservation app (at least at the last time I visited). You may try to download the app, find Sakanaya on it, send a reservation, and come by later. They might be able to just let you in with the reservation online."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good, though expensive for what it is. The fish was fresh and the service was fine. I agree with another reviewer who said that the hot house sake was a large carafe and a good deal for $6. The decor gives the space a clean feel, especially compared to some of the other restaurants on that block. I went with two friends, and each of us ordered a regular roll and then split a specialty roll. I wanted to get sake don instead of a roll, but it was just too expensive. Overall, this is a solid little sushi place and I would come here again... if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi in town. Everything is fresh and well priced, and the servers are very friendly. I especially like to come for lunch for one of their sushi lunch specials. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight for a friend's 40th birthday and had a great time!  Pros: - Hip and fun atmosphere - Excellent service - Beautiful presentation - Everything was fresh   Cons: - Seemed overpriced - Sushi was good, but not great.  I thought the maki rolls were small. Others seemed happy with their nigiri. Hubby said the philly roll was delish..  - Not as wide of a selection of sushi as some other places. - Ramen was really good, but again, not $12 or $13 good.  The broth could've been a bit more flavorful, but I wasn't unhappy with it."}
{"text":"Ahh.. I love this place and always go there for a treat. Willis Tower, chirashi, chicken wings and ramen. All taste very good. Need to wait during lunch and dinner. A little bit pricey but taste of food deserve it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Absolutely fresh, good service, nice environment, reasonably priced, and friendly staff.   Kamikaze (without the mayo on top) and Windy City (which is like the well-known Rainbow Roll) rolls are my favorites.  Overall , I could have not had a better experience, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Best japanese food on the campus. Though it's a little pricy, the quality of the fish is very good. Suggest try gold rush, alligator, spider, and sakanaya. Ramen is no that great."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is wonderful, very fresh and delicious. Service was great. The menu offers a nice selection of sushi, noodles, and more at a variety of prices to suit everyone. Only \"downside\" to this place is that it's always packed- expect a wait, but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"It's pricey, but the environment is nice and the ramen is great! Sushi is delicious :)"}
{"text":"I'm definitely coming back!   Small awesome dining experience!! The sushi was so good. Even the water tasted like it came from a bottle it tasted so good!  Our waitress was on spot! She worked quick, made sure we were taken care of and was nice.  The sushi was delicious!!!  Their menu had a lot of stuff I want to try so I'll be back to try some more!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So, I finally made it over here to eat since a friend and I were on campus for another event, but we got hungry afterwards. We decided to come to Sakanaya because the students haven't come back from spring break yet! We walked right in and were sat immediately.   We ordered the veggie roll with shitake mushroom (you choose what veggies from the list in the veggie roll description) and miso first. I got the miso for free with my yelp check in. The shitake roll was good. It has a little sweet flavor from whatever they marinate it in.   Then, we got the sweet raw shrimp, sushi sampler, red clam nigiri, mackerel nigiri, salmon roe nigiri, and spider roll.   All of those were good, but we were interested in the sweet raw shrimp because we'd both never had it before. Our favorite part of that plate was the fried shrimp head. Sakanaya, you guys need to do the fried shrimp heads as an appetizer. I'd come and order it. It's good!   Daniel, our server was really nice and made sure we had enough water and even asked us about the sweet raw shrimp because he hadn't tried it. We told him the raw shrimp was good, but the fried shrimp head was better! Lol.   Yum! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sakanaya is my favorite sushi restaurant on campus!! The fancy rolls and sashimi look and taste really good, so it's not surprising that the food is expensive. However, the ramen is not as good as expected."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with Sakanaya!  My brother and I were in town for the holidays and after stuffing ourselves for 2 days straight we were both ready for something light. Naturally, I hopped on yelp to check out the sushi situation in Chambana and came across this place. So glad I did.  Since the students were gone for the holiday I thought we would be okay getting in and we were. There was a 5 minute wait which was a-okay with me. This place is TINY so i can only imagine how packed it gets but the short wait gave us time to check out the fish and it looked beautiful so we knew we were in for a treat.  We ended up doing a chef's choice sashimi plate and it was wonderful. The fish was fresh and delicious! Service was friendly and efficient and I love the modern decor. By far the best sushi i've had in the midwest. Nice job Sakanaya! Now can you just expand already so next time I come in town i can come in without a wait ;)"}
{"text":"I was waiting for a ramen shop to open up my entire time in undergrad at U of I, so when I came back to visit and heard that one finally opened up (my friends tell me the one across the street doesn't count), I had to check it out.    Came here for lunch with 3 friends on Saturday.  Even though it was mom's weekend, the restaurant was only about half full.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen.  My expectations were definitely low, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The broth was flavorful and the ingredients seemed fresh.    It wasn't perfect, although admittedly this is just nitpicking.  The noodles were slightly overcooked so they didn't have the springy texture that ramen noodles should, and there were some noodles that were clumped together from overcooking.  The meat wasn't as tender as it should be, although it was not tough by any means.  The most disappointing thing was that the egg was a simple hard boiled egg rather than the soy sauce eggs you typically find in ramen."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ever ate when I visited Champaign before moving here. It was more of a working lunch so I didn't order too adventurously, but the noodles I got were excellent and the soup was perfect. The wait can get a bit long at meal times - it's worth a modest wait - but if it's too long there are plenty of options in the area."}
{"text":"Expensive but good. It's always a long wait so you might have to make reservations. The ramen there is the best in my opinion. They also have really good hot green tea"}
{"text":"I liked it a lot when it first opened last year. The line was so long and you always need to get there 30 minutes before you open to get a seat immediately, otherwise you would need to wait for at least an hour. It was worth the wait because of the atmosphere that's good for dating and seafood was very fresh. However, everything changed. Their seafood is no more fresh, but their prices are way higher than the average. I don't really have a reason going there anymore. Why would you pay more to get something very average?"}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised. First class sushi, right on campus, in central Illinois? Amazing! The decor is really nice, the service is top notch and most importantly - the fish / sushi itself is really great quality. We had some miso soup, hot sake, a couple of specialty sushi rolls (Sakanaya and OMG), a classic spicy tuna and shrimp tempura. Everything was delicious, fresh and well presented. This is certainly the best sushi place in town!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must go place in Champaign area. Great service, awesome foods and reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only restaurant in Campustown that meets both my sushi-loving Chinese mom and unadventurous American dad's standards, so we usually come here whenever they visit.  The sushi is fresh and pretty good considering that we're in the middle of Illinois. The ramen is generally good, but there has been once or twice when it was a little too salty for my dad. The wings and other fried stuff are all delicious. The decor is nice to look at and the food is always well-presented.  For those complaining about wait times, Sakanaya has an app that shows you approximate wait times, as well as lets you virtually \"get in line\" (basically make a reservation for ~20-60min later) and show up when they're likely to have a table.   I took one star off because the staff seems to show bias depending on who's in your party. I brought a Mexican friend once in the afternoon when there were very few customers, got no service during the meal, and he had to physically flag down a server to get the check. The Korean friend I was eating with during their busiest dinner hours could barely finish her meal between the over-attentive server and chatting with me. I know y'all probably don't mean it but racism's not cool, people."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night...glad to see they were open because a lot of places close on Mondays. The place was packed at 630pm which was a good sign.  Host took my name and entered my phone number to ensure my place in line and to text me since I walked next door for a few minutes. 15 minutes later Im seated at a 4 top even tho I was alone. I said I would happily wait for a 2 top but she said I had waited long enough and that was that!   Ordered seaweed salad, agedashi tofu, assorted sashimi and hot sake. Everything was great but I wish the tofu had been cut in smaller pieces which would make it easier to eat but still very nice. Not a fan of white tuna...its actually escolar which can negatively affect some people when eaten raw...I just pass on it...love it when cooked through like at Miga. All in all a great meal.  But the real plus was being looked after by Sophia...a very helpful and attentive employee that always had a smile on her face and was very welcoming. Bravo to her...she will no doubt find great success in life with that kind of attitude and work ethic!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. A little pricy but definitely worth it for the quality of the food. Have been here many times and service is always wonderful and attentive. I always recommend this restaurant to my friends who are looking for new sushi places in the CU."}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had! It's pricey, but if you're willing to spend I highly recommend this place. The Willis tower and sakanaya roll are exquisite delicacies, and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"Great space and wonderfully unique dishes. Staff is great. No wine for purchase but bring yours for a small corking fee.. We simply loved it!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi store on campus! Love how fresh their food is. Great for celebrations or dates."}
{"text":"New to U of I area and friend recommended this place. Sashimi and shrimp tempura is good! Nothing too special to this place since Japanese restaurants are everywhere in Chicago. For some reason it was super hot in there. Maybe the AC was broken. Wish they had a bigger order of just the sashimi. They only have the appetizer size or a combo with sushi :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hot commodity in the Champaign-urbana area. It's probably one of the better sushi and ramen spots on campus. Ozu ramen has better ramen, but sakura has good sushi. I like getting the Willis tower with my friends because it's fun to smash it down and it's super delicious and unique."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, I always worry about getting fish in the midwest but I am going to hand it to Sakanaya, the Chirashi I had was absolutely delicious. The fish was wonderful, fresh even and with good variety of fishes. I loved the decor and the ambiance, very relaxing. The portions are good, though if you're on a budget this might not be the place for you. Definitely worth getting again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Sushi is yum as is the Ramen. Nice atmosphere and service is consistent."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to Sakanaya for the first time with a medium expectation, knowing that we have experienced lots of nice japanese restaurants in our country and in Japan. We ordered a K2 and a VIP with some salmon sashimis, and it was interesting how the rolls came out beautifully and really tasty. The sashimi was also thick and fresh ans melts in your mouth. Beyond expectation! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at a reasonable price...fish was fresh and delicious and Miso was really good too. An excellent choice for those craving a great, authentic Japanese meal. But get there early if you want a table. It fills up fast."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I miss the Sakanaya roll. Barely any of the sushi places on campus offer scallop, so I immediately ordered it. It's awesome! Seared scallop with bonito flakes tops the roll and it has salmon, crab meat, and avocado (okay, so a really glorified Cali roll), but it's very tasty and presented gorgeously. It's around $14, so be ready to part with your cash! The treat is definitely worth it though.  The ramen is delicious, albeit pricey. Huge portions of everything are in your ramen. My only complaint is that some of my ramen noodles had a strange. mild soapy taste. The pork broth had a strong, savory flavor, and I recommend getting the tonkotsu ramen. The slices of pork and veggies are also generous, which I really liked. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, so I don't think the price is warranted.   The interior is very small and a bit cramped when it's full of people coming in and out, so be ready to be bumped a bit or squeeze by people at dinner. However, the staff are polite and do their best to stay organized; they use an iPad system to keep track of orders and tables, and they wait in the back or to the side while on standby to avoid collisions. I think it's considerate because the wait might take a while (even with a reservation), so you can walk around on Green Street and they'll call you when a table opens up.  So far it's the only place on campus that has good ramen, so I suppose I could say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places on campus! I have loved every roll I tried here. All the fish is so fresh! Check it out if you are in the mood for a nice sushi night/lunch!"}
{"text":"Sakanaya is not the sushi joint you want to miss when you're in town! Before making my way to Chicago, I made a one week stop in Champaign to visit a friend. I was told that Sakanaya is perhaps the best sushi restaurant there.   I strongly recommend utilizing the yelp waitlist feature as it gets swarmed by famished sushi muncher within minutes after their opening time. On two occasions I walked in at about 5:20 PM, 20 minutes after they opened. Wrong move, I ended up have to wait and stare at those trays of tasty sushi leaving the kitchen for a good 25 minutes. I think I drooled a bit too. Oh dang, TMI..  I generally enjoy all the sushi rolls I ordered. The memorable ones are sakanaya roll (salmon, grilled scallops, and avocado), playgirl roll (tuna, shrimp tempura, and avocado), and VIP roll (grilled salmon and lobster tempura). When you order the VIP roll, they will indeed serve it as if you're a VVIP! *look at the photo for more details*  Why 4 stars then? I have to dock one star for its disappointing ramen. I was craving for ramen at the time and had been let down by other places in Champaign. Considering it's a 4.5 stars establishment and the substantial amount of amazing reviews for the ramen, I didn't think twice to get a bowl of tonkotsu ramen. I was wrong. The broth was bland, the chashu was dry and flavorless, and the egg was hard boiled instead of soft boiled. It wasn't even comparable to some of the decent ramen I had in Seattle, let alone the great one.  Service was an A+, very attentive and insightful. If you do visit here, stick with the sushi and sashimi. You certainly won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"the willis tower is very delicious, and the I love salmon combo is to die for. the sashimi melts in your mouth"}
{"text":"I took my parents here looking at the great reviews on yelp. And I want to add that my parents are recent inductee to the sushi scene, and they were excited as well as very skeptical about this venture. Alas! this place actually made it worse for them. The rolls are scanty, uninspired and very generic- almost like a gas station sushi. On a positive note, the decor is nice, the vessels/plates/dishes are beautiful, the staff is friendly and the ambience has a good vibe.  The final nail on this 'never again' fiasco with this restaurant should be the decaying tuna. Yes, you read it right. I got two pieces of tuna that had funky smell and had discolored hardened brown patch at the bottom. Yuck!  FYI to the sushi lovers in Chambana: We drive two hours to go to sushi club in Indianapolis and they have fantastic sushi there, even being an All you can eat sushi place (comes with it's own stigma), that place is hard to beat and blows ala carte Sakanaya out of the water. I'd recommend people to go out of Champaign/Urbana and try that place it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Great atmosphere and attention to detail with everything from the cups to soy sauce bottles. One of my new favorite spots on Green St!  The one issue is that it's tiny so there may be a wait."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant on Green! We waited for like 20 mins but totally worth it! The octopus is so fresh and yummy! Katsu is great too, but very deeply fried, maybe a bit too hard for me haha"}
{"text":"I visited UIUC for my cousin's graduation, and she recommended to have dinner at this restaurant. Food here was really delicious! Wanna visit again if I have a chance to go to Champaign. !!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place. Best sushi outside of Chicago. Download their no wait app or come when the students are gone unless you want to wait. I wish they had another location not on campus. I have a lunch date there next week. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Another delectable dinner at C-U's preeminent sushi powerhouse!  Tonight's favorites were the steamed shrimp dumplings and the playgirl sushi.  Outstanding waitstaff for our 9 diners which included 4 kids.  Definitely worth our 45 minute wait!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi, probably best in town. The wait can be long, but very much worth the wait. Go there to celebrate accomplishment worth my best friend."}
{"text":"The sushi here is wonderful! I love the classic roles but the signature roles are definitely something to try as well. OMG and Playgirl are some of the best, according to my waitress.   The staff here is very attentive and friendly. They are happy to help and even if one of them is not your actual waiter/waitress they will still check in and make sure everything is going well.   Another thing I love is that this place is open late! Late night sushi cravings are definitely a thing, so it's perfect having somewhere delicious on campus to go!"}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite sushi place in town.  It's a little expensive - hopefully they come out with some cheaper lunch/takeout options!"}
{"text":"I give it a decent rating bc the place is just too pretty and the servers super nice. However, the ramen was just ok, nothing special. Thats the only thing I had besides the octapus which was also not bad. Leaves a lot to be desired tho."}
{"text":"Might be good sushi for a college town, but the premium in price is not justified. The Specialty rolls are portioned appropriately, but the flavor is not there.   The best value is the sashimi."}
{"text":"I think I am addicted to their chicken wings! This place can get extremely busy but that's because the food is delicious!   During my most recent visit, I ordered hot and spicy wings but received the half and half. I told the waiter and he just apologized. I didn't mind to try something new anyways. As I was finished, I asked for my left overs to be boxed up and the waiter gave me a new seaweed salad instead of boxing the one that I ate a majority of! Thank you for accommodating."}
{"text":"I love salmon so I decided to try I Love Salmon Plate and absolutely loved it. As a salmon connoisseur, I highly recommend it. All the salmon was fresh and the pieces were thick. The plate was so large that I could not finish it and had to enlist help from other people at our table.   I would advise that if you do not arrive within 10 minutes of their opening time, be prepared to have 30 minutes to an hour wait. We walked in 5 minutes after they opened and half the restaurant was already filled, and within 15 minutes of opening, there was already a line going out the door."}
{"text":"This place is always packed - and for good reason!!! We get here right when they open in order to get a seat right away. The sushi is so FRESH! Better than most Chicago sushi places to be honest. I highly recommend this place. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. This is a popular place and has good food, but management and service are awful.  Our party arrived and put in our name, knowing that there would be a wait. Our expected wait time was 45 minutes, which was perfectly fine with us. They took our phone number and said that we'd receive a text message when our table was ready. We went outside to wait, went to some places nearby, and came back an hour and fifteen later to ask about our table.  The hostess claimed that because we weren't present, we had been placed lower in the queue. What is the point of a SMS-based notification system if you don't use it? We told the hostess, and subsequently the manager, that we'd like to be seated next, as we were waiting for their message and instead were skipped.  They seated several other parties before telling us we had to wait an additional 40 minutes, then we left. Bad business practice!"}
{"text":"I went there last week and the food was amazing. I haven't had much sushi in life but this was great. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. I wasnt so sure of which sake to have and the server gave me a nice description of each of them and helped me choose one."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Champaign! I use to live in Miami, FL and this sushi is comparable. Beats Kofusion!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, favorite was the Miga, but all were very good.  Miso ramen was very tasty too. Customer service was top notch."}
{"text":"It's the Saturday before Thanksgiving at 8pm... I ventured into Campustown... it was a ghost town.  I figured this would be an awesome chance to eat here... finally.  Walk in the door... oops, 40 minutes wait.  Wha-wha-what?!?!?   Disappointed, I decided to order take out.... since this was my first time ordering sushi here, I decided to just go with my standard order of a spicy salmon roll -- I use it to compare to my standard ideal of a good spicy salmon roll.  Hostess was friendly but said it was 10-15 minutes before I get the order.  ?!!?!?!   The sushi chef is already spreading the rice down on the nori?!!  Whatever.... I had my takeout in hand after 3 minutes.  I think this hostess is just over-exaggerating the wait time so that when your name is finally called, you'll be all excited and feel that expectations are exceeded.  I must say that the packaging of my take-out was excellent.   It was in a narrow box with chopsticks,soy sauce, and napkin neatly wrapped around it in an elastic.   That's my only positive point of the takeout.  The roll looked awful at fist sight.... something didn't look right about the rice.  Not sure what it was.   It sure didn't taste any better.  99% of spicy salmon rolls that I've had are covered in a spicy mayo.   I swear that this was just squirted with a bit of a sweetened schiracha sauce.  And the rice was not cooked properly... it still had a bite to it and was grainy.  It also was not seasoned properly.... I've eaten at some high end sushi joints in New York AND Tokyo, and I've even attempted to make it and I know that there was hardly any rice vinegar in this.... you could taste every single grain of rice.   You know how they say that sushi is supposed to be the perfect balance of rice to fish and when served at the perfect temperature (body temp FYI), it is supposed to create a wonderful sensation in your mind and body.... yah, well, these sushi chefs need to go back to sushi-school or at least a REAL sushi restaurant and wash rice for three years before they even attempt sushi again.      Again, it was expensive for a salmon roll -- $7.   I've had better from a grocery store (I haven't eaten that stuff in about 10 years but still, it was better.).   I still want to try the ramen, but now I'm not so sure... something in the back of my mind is screaming, \"ARE YOU NUTS?!??!!?\"  To the salmon that gave its life for this sad excuse of a sushi roll.... I am sorry, but your death was for nothing."}
{"text":"I tried the Sears/Willis Tower dessert after seeing the reviews on Yelp. It is the best.  I also ordered a variety of sushi and they were very good as well.   It gets really packed in there on Friday nights. I had a group of four and we waited 40 minutes. It was worth the wait though."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem!  The \"best sushi i've ever eaten\" from my wife, and she has has Sushi all over.  The wings are amazingly good, and a disappointment that they aren't always available.  Go here ASAP!"}
{"text":"A Champaign 5! An actual 4 :).  The Place: Of the handful of places that serve sushi in the area, this place always has me coming back. It's intimate, quick, and pretty tasty for the price you pay (which is next to nothing if you're a regular sushi eater). The waiting area gets crowded, but that's part of the fun for me. Download the \"No Line\" app, to \"make a reservation\" it's very helpful since they don't take actual reservations. My waiter was always helpful, try to sit with Sophia, if possible, and you'll be guaranteed a great evening.   The Food: Classic rolls are dirt cheap and delicious considering that. The signature rolls are elaborate and worth it. The VIP roll comes on a flaming plate if you're looking for some attention and good taste. I love the Playgirl after that, then the Kamikaze. Haven't had their alcohol, but it comes in mason jars and looks delicious. Their ramen is also VERY good and very filling for about ~$13 USD.   The Wait: Again, get the \"No Line\" app, it's very helpful bc people know this place is pretty worth it and the town is nondescript. Saturday nights have like 1-1.75 hour waits if you just walk up. But, if you're smart about it, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Damn good Sushi to be in the middle of the Midwest. The Ramen is hearty and yummy too! the Willis tower appetizer is a favorite among me and my sushi snobbish friends. The decor is super New Yorky and pleasant. It is very small and every time I have gone it has been packed! It sucks that it is on campus as I hate trying to maneuver in campustown and there is NO parking but it is worth the trek if you are looking for the best sushi in Chambana with a side of Ramen and other adventurous Asian fusion options.  (Oh did I mention that are open til 1am or something crazy like that? Holla!)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I usually come here for their sushi, but their ramen is good too. The Willis Tower dish is worth trying if you like spicy tuna. There's always a line though which sucks, but it's a popular place so it's expected.  Overall nice atmosphere and their water containers/pitchers are so cool and unique."}
{"text":"Great, fresh, delicious sushi. It tasted almost as good as the sushi I had in Seattle. The servers were really busy but overall did a good job. They had to move our table for a bigger party, and gave us complimentary dumplings in return. I recommend the Crunch Munch rolls! Also, their soy sauce comes in an eye dropper."}
{"text":"This place was definitely good. But I also don't necessarily get the hype.   I got there around 5:15, so thankfully there was no wait. I ordered a mojito, and was sad to say that my glass was no where near filled up to the top. For a $9 mojito, I would've expected at least a full drink.   I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered appetizers. So that is what my review will be based on I ordered a miso soup and their fried tofu appetizer. The miso soup was good. Not the best I've had. Not the worst. The fried tofu however was extremely bland, even with the sauce. And I had to dowse my food with soy sauce just to be able to enjoy it.   I hear the sushi is good, but everything else left way more to be desired."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here on our one year anniversary and it was lovely.  We had to wait about 15-20 minute wait that went by really fast. The atmosphere of the place was beautiful and the service was fast and friendly. We started with two classic rolls, California and Philadelphia. They were very fresh and very well made, the presentation was very pretty.  We then got entrees, I got the Chicken Teriyaki and my boyfriend got the beef chefs special and both were amazing. They came with so much food and even included miso soup and a salad as well.  We got drinks as well and they were very reasonably priced, at $5 for a glass of Pinot, very worth it.  Overall love the decor the food and everything about this place, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just dined here with my husband and our friend, and everything was top to bottom delicious.   Certainly it seems like there's a vocal minority at work here.   No bother, here is what you need to know:   The miso ramen was simply perfect. Everything about it, the balance of flavor, the portion size, the doneness of the noodles -- perfect.   I had a tempura shrimp roll, and it was 7 pieces deep, all big and overflowing with everything you'd want in a roll.   But let's talk about the fact that the ownership actually put some care and attention to the details about the way this place looks. Fact is, humans are very much moved by their environment, and Sakanaya designed this place to be an experience.   I will gladly pay the prices on the menu to eat this type of fare in a really beautiful space. All others can hit up Panda Express. Enjoy.   Nice work, Sakanaya. Really impressive. We'll be back, time and time again."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Atmosphere is very cool.  Front desk staff were super friendly. I used the yelp check in app for the first time and I thought it was great. Our table was ready when we arrived.  The waitress was great. However I used my free miso soup coupon from yelp and she forgot to bring it. She had me validate it at the table so it's not like I still have the unused coupon to use.  The spider roll was great. The champaign Urbana was awesome.  I had another roll with fresh fish on top, and it was awesome. Everyone's favorite, Philadelphia roll was yummy. Crunch and munch was too spicy but really good. Overall was a great experience. Would highly recommend and definitely will return."}
{"text":"Called and tried to make reservations. The host told us they did not accept reservations. When we arrived, four different (and some larger) parties that arrived after us were sat before us. We waited 40 minutes and ended up leaving without eating."}
{"text":"Just went here with some friends tonight.   I had yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri and shoyu ramen.  The fish was the freshest I've had in the CU area, and I've been to Sushi Kame, Kamakura, Yellofin, Kofusion, you name it.  The ramen was also delicious, with very savory broth.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very chic, but not pretentious. Service was great and my table was waited on by the manager of the restaurant, who knew his stuff. This place would be excellent for a date.  A rule in life: you get what you pay for. If you want bad sushi with horrible rice, there are plenty of places to go on Green St., but if you want delicious sushi from a superb place, go to Sakanaya."}
{"text":"Went at dinner time with a friend. My Sakanaya roll was ok. Nothing impressive. For a 15 dollar roll I expect a little more flavor. Her 6 dollar California roll actually tasted a lot better than mine. The atmosphere's nice. I love the decoration and design. I'll probably come back to try a different roll. So far I still think the lunch eel roll is the best. I guess I'll stick to lunch now"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for a nice vegetarian Japanese experience in Champaign. Great Seaweed salad, teriyaki tofu, and avocado rolls! A simple style, nice ambience and a young college crowd."}
{"text":"The Sushi is very GOOD!  I came with my girlfriend on a Friday night for dinner. We got there at 7 and had to wait around 20ish minutes to get a table but they had a seating system where they text you when they're ready for you so it wasn't a big deal.   The Atmosphere: The restaurant itself is beautiful, modern and minimalist. It is a bit small but I personally enjoy that vibe at a sushi restaurant; it usually means that the kitchen can take the time needed to make the food for you.   The Food/Drink: I was not very thrilled with the drink menu. I really wanted some nigori sake but it was $45 for a bottle, a bit much. We ended up getting a bottle of makgeolli and some beers. As for the food we got steamed gyozas (had to ask for them to be steamed because they are on the menu as fried) and 4 different sushi rolls: shrimp tempura, Philadelphia, Sakanaya, and the Windy City. We were satisfied with the gyozas and all of the rolls but especially enjoyed the sakanaya and windy city rolls, definitely a repeat order item. The fish was fresh and the rolls looked extremely appetizing the way that they were presented.   The service:  This is the only part of the restaurant I wasn't thrilled about. Our waitress was a bit cold and seemed like she was going out of her way every time we asked something. She could have been having a bad night so I don't think it would be fair to say the restaurant as a whole has bad service.  Takeaway: All in all I will definitely make Sakanaya my go to sushi destination in Champaign/Urbana."}
{"text":"Love the Willis Tower and Yaya roll! On the more expensive side but tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago by myself on a Friday night.  Yes, I am that guy who doesn't mind going out to eat by myself.  The staff and atmosphere were great and the sushi was amazingly fresh.  I ordered the dumplings, a couple pieces of shushimi (salmon and blue fin tuna) and a roll.  I also ordered the most amazing sake.  The sake was chilled in ice and had cucumber added to it.  It tasted like cucumber water and was so smooth, which is dangerous since it contains 19% alcohol.  I liked everything so much that I ordered another round of everything excluding the dumplings.  My final bill came out to $80, but it was well worth it.  I can't wait to be back in town to try another round."}
{"text":"This place has really good ramen and udon. The tempura shrimp udon is my go-to - it has tasty broth with good noodles. Wish they had a vegetarian option. The sushi's pretty good too, but not special enough for the price IMO. It gets crowded but if you're craving ramen is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! The fish is always so fresh. It can get a bit crowded in the small space, but the food is worth it. Service is usually fast. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My favorite Japanese restaurant in Urbana-Champaign."}
{"text":"By far the best place to get sushi in the area.  Everything is fresh and you can tell that the chef takes pride in each piece of sushi that he creates."}
{"text":"Best sushi place around and probably the best service I've had in a long time. Went with two buddies of mine and we had about a 5 minute wait in a packed house and received our food well within 10 minutes. Refills on water were done before we even had time to look up and they were extremely helpful about making our experience worthy.  Ramen was off the charts and the sushi was fresh!"}
{"text":"Where else can you get fresh, buttery salmon that evanesces with flavor?  This place has been a favorite of mine ever since they opened up on campus a few years ago, and consequently the only place you can get a decent Sweet Shrimp Sashimi/Nigiri without having to venture into the Windy City.   My favorites are the 'I Love Salmon' plate (1 regular maki, 1 hwedubap maki, 4 sashimi slices, and 4 nigiri), Sakanaya Roll, and the Willis Tower (unique tower consisting of tiers of rice, artificial crab, avocado, tuna, and salmon) foolproof every time! If you check in to this establishment on your Yelp app, you're eligible to receive a complimentary serving of Miso Soup.  While they don't take reservations, it's smart to show up during non peak dining hours and putting your name and cell number on their wait-list/app at the reception carrel. You can walk around the area for the time being (there a Chatime, UO, and Walgreens nearby) and before you know it, you'll receive a text indicating that your table is ready.   I wouldn't recommend going with a large group since the dining space is on the smaller/narrow side.  Best sushi for the price in Central Illinois! I'll be coming back every time I'm visiting my Alma Mater!"}
{"text":"This place has really fresh sushi,but it can be pricy. They don't take reservations and they have limited dinning room so the wait for a table is really long."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place I've ever been to. I've only been to a small handful, granted - but this is the first place I was ever introduced to sushi and they really set the standard for me. Very expensive, but worth the money every couple of months. Very cool, clean-cut ambience. Unfortunately the small size of the location means that the tables are all fairly small (2-4 people). I believe I've seen larger groups accommodated before, but I'm sure they'd have to be slow or you'd have to have a reservation. Always busy late at night when I come in. Obviously I recommend coming here casually/for no other reason than to eat good sushi, but it's also a wonderful place to go if you're looking for a more formal meal on campus (Moms'/Dads' Weekend, dates, birthdays, etc)"}
{"text":"For the quality of food & the quality of service, I'm giving two stars! The wait time for this restaurant is ridiculous, but I understand that they have limited seating. Our walk-in wait was about 45 minutes long for three people. After getting seated we felt rushed to eat by serving staff, however the food arrived very quickly after being ordered! Now to the sushi, the sushi rice was way too hard & my california roll had some mayo mixed in with the crab, & nowhere on the menu did it say the crab was prepared that way. If you have an allergy to eggs, this would have been nice to know. Anyway, the prices were good but I guess my expectations were a little too high, based of others' reviews."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and my cousin picked out Sakanaya for us. We are definitely a ramen loving family, so it's a must that we get together to enjoy a hot bowl on those cold winter days!   We walked in for lunch, party of 10 and we were lucky enough they had tables to put together for us.   I was digging the ambiance of the restaurant. It had that new, hip feel to it, while still keeping that Japanese classy feel. It got pretty busy after we had been there for a bit, so I could tell this place was popular in town. Also, I do have to mention their ladies room. It was sooo clean! I love when restaurants take care of their restrooms. To me, that is a sign of a good establishment.   Our waitress, her name has slipped my mind (Sophia, maybe?) was a sweet girl. Very polite and attentive. She took care of us very well by answering all of our questions and seeing to it that our needs were met.   The lunch menu was a bit lacking. It was very small, and from what the waitress told us, we couldn't really order anything off of the dinner menu. We were strictly stuck to the lunch menu, and that was frustrating. I was craving nigiri and sashimi as well! I ordered a bowl of their Soicy Tonkotsu ramen. and split a roll combo (choice of one regular roll + one yaya roll), but she let us substitute a different roll for the yaya, so we ended up getting a tuna and salmon roll for the combo.   RAMEN -  It wasn't spicy enough, so I asked for another side of the spicy paste they used in the bowl itself. That made it the perfect level of spicy! Unfortunately, I can't say anything else about the bowl was perfect.. In all honesty, the broth and noodles tasted like instant ramen. The noodles were extremely soft and soggy. The spicy paste made the broth taste better, but it still lacked that heavy, full of flavor, ramen broth I'm used to back home. Also, there was a BUNCH of white onions AND green onions. If I didn't love onions, I would definitely say it was overkill (which is what another cousin said of their bowl). I'm not used to white onions in my ramen either, so that kind of threw me off, and it wasn't enjoyable. But the biggest problem with the ramen that I had was the egg. The egg is my favorite part of ramen, hands down. This egg tasted exactly like my boiled eggs in my kitchen.. The yolk was dry and broke off in chunks, the egg white was bland. It was just.. depressing. I probably could've made this bowl of ramen in a dorm room.   SALMON + TUNA ROLL - The cousin I split the combo with ate the tuna roll since I'm more of a salmon kind of girl, so I don't have any comments on that roll, but the salmon was really good. It was fresh and buttery. Pretty good for a plain salmon roll.   All in all, I would have given Sakanaya three stars had it not been for the decor, restroom cleanliness, and service. I would return on my next visit for sushi, but count me out for their ramen."}
{"text":"Fantastic date night. Be prepared to wait for a table. The wait is well worth your time. I've been three times now and will be returning again and again. My only criticism: Serve your good sake cold. The heat masks the flavor."}
{"text":"This is the best japanese food restaurant in the area. It has a nice atmosphere and the restaurant open till very late. The last time I'm there, I got the sakanaya don, which is basically 4 kinds of fish eggs, veggies, rice, and one uni. It was my first time trying something like this and sakanaya has made me fell in love with this dish. Will definately come back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!  I don't now if someone was blowing smoke up my butt, but I heard they are the only restaurant that pays extra insurance to have their fish never frozen.  Lunch specials are very affordable, and the poke bowls are also amazing.  I wish the restaurant was larger, and I've had to deal with long waits.  I like to go when the U of I is not in session or over the summer, so I know I won't have to deal long lines.  I will go back for many many more moons."}
{"text":"We went here as we were stopping in Champaign. This restaurant is the place to be in the city. The sushi was great and so were the noodle bowls. If you want some great food that is reasonably priced check this place out."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi on campus, I get the OMG roll every time, which is lit on fire and is delicious. Their sushi is very different compared to other restaurants on campus. The place is very small, but it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Champaign. The Willis tower is a must if you want an appetizer. I order it every time I go there. It is good for 2-4 people to share. I like sushi combination or sashimi combination. They are so great. Ramen is not recommended, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. By the way, VIP rolls looks very fancy. It is with fire. But it tastes so so."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and every-time was a good experience! Especially highly recommend signature roll- Sakanaya roll and VIP. I would like to try all the rolls later."}
{"text":"I really like sushi, and I wasn't super hungry so I went with that. I ordered tuna rolls, plus some salmon and salmon roe nigiri. The rolls were average, but the nigiri was fantastic! Perhaps some of the best I've had. The fish was huge, and beautifully displayed. It was obviously a quality piece of fish. Oh yeah, and it tasted good too.  We had a bit of a wait for our table, which gave me plenty of time to admire the decor and ambiance (both great). The waitstaff was professional and friendly, even when I couldn't make up my mind, or remember what I had already ordered.  Overall, this is a classy place with great food. Next time I'll have to try the ramen, and maybe in a while I'll consider this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"A year ago I came to visit my boyfriend at U of I and we googled \"best place to eat in Champaign\" and went! I'm so glad we went to Sakanaya, it was truly a surprise. It's cozy and clean inside, and while it can get busy they do a great job of working with customers to make you comfortable and up to date on table status while you wait. The sushi is as good as it's going to get; being in the middle of Illinois it really is a pleasant surprise to stumble on something this good. We'll have to try their ramen next!"}
{"text":"The best sushi and ramen place on Green Street. Great atmosphere, vibe, accents, and top-notch service. Lovely place to take a date!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly certain I could eat here daily. This is some of the best sushi I've ever had.  We tried four rolls and they were all great and super fresh. I think our waiter, Andy, was even better. He was awesome! Very polite, professional, and attentive. The only thing I would say I was slightly disappointed in was the size of the place. I wish it was bigger so we could get in quicker or come with a bigger party. I think they would definitely benefit from expanding, but we'll be back regardless!"}
{"text":"Like their sushi and ramen noodles. Good place for couples/single diner."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the campus location, but hands down the best sushi in Champaign. Try the Willis Tower appetizer.... My favorite on the menu!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the Midwest, we've been looking for a good sushi place. In Chicago we ended up at some restaurant where the rice tasted fermented and sour, so we didn't have much hope of finding someplace that tasted as good as sushi from the west coast.   The sushi here, however, tastes fresh and clean. At 8pm on a Saturday night, they told us it'd be a 20-30 minute wait but we didn't have to wait nearly that long. The dining area is a little narrow and congested, but the food is excellent. Had the tuna combo plate and the kamikaze. The shrimp tempura was a little greasy, but good. Would definitely come back and recommend for people with parties of 4 or less."}
{"text":"Just want to say, yet again, that this place is my absolute favorite restaurant not only in Champaign, but anywhere! Thanks for the amazing service and delicious, fresh food. A few menu items went up in price recently -- a tad bit disappointing, but will continue coming here! I would love more dessert options, maybe some ice cream?"}
{"text":"Hail Sakanaya. This is one of the only places I will ever go for sushi in Chambana. They always make sure to provide thick, fat slices of fish. Their ramen is yummy too. Atmosphere, of course, gets stars."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi place in the Champaign area. My roommate took me here for my birthday and we ordered the Lobster roll and the OMG roll, both which came on fire. The presentation is great but the flavors are even greater. This place is a bit pricy but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is a good way to put it.  Appetizer portions were smaller than expected. Sashimi are decidedly on the small side considering the price, even for a small town in the midwest. Server dropped off food and disappeared, never checking in to see if we wanted anything (more wasabi, the portion of it being small too), nor noticing the empty plates and credit card on the table for way too long. (No, they weren't busy.) Food was edible and nobody got sick."}
{"text":"Fair quality food and nice atmosphere, but little over price. Willis towers is good as appetizer, but also good for meal for women. I frequently ordered Their Hwei dup bab and ramen."}
{"text":"I was not a fan of sushi before coming here, but I thought I'd try it again with some people who were a little more sushi-savvy than I. Boy did this place change my perspectives! I was so happy with my whole experience here.   We had a party of four and ordered 4 Miso Soups, 2 Ramens, and 5 Sushi Rolls. It was the night before finals week started, so we decided to go all out. The 5 Sushi Rolls that we got were California, Playgirl, Windy City, VIP and Gold Rush. I voted the Gold Rush my favorite (also the most expensive), then playgirl, VIP, Cali, and then Windy City. I'm not really a fan of fish, so I was a little worried about that, but all of the ones we ordered had fish, and loved them all.   We got  our food very quickly and everything was gorgeous. The atmosphere was very contemporary and felt like I was in an upscale sushi restaurant in the city. It was nice to have something so close to me at school, and so classy.   We left feeling full, but not weighed down. Everything was so fresh and beautifully presented. I will be checking out a lot more sushi restaurants from now on.   It was a little pricey (we wound up paying around $115 for the table) but we left extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"Oh wow, an actual ramen place on campus. Who would have thought?  People complaining about the price of ramen obviously have not had their share of ramen to know pricing. It's about what you'll pay at any restaurant, except maybe street vendors or whatnot.   Anyways, the ramen is decent, not amazing. It's probably the best you'll find on campus. What makes the ramen? The broth. Being the snob I am, I asked for a little bit of each ramen's broth but was told that they make the broth with each bowl of ramen. Hmm. Some flags when up there. Regardless, I tried both the soy based and chicken based broths and found there was really nothing special about either of them. Again, if you're looking for ramen this place is the best bet, but don't expect anything spectacular.  The sushi was what I was more impressed with, as every single place on campus was disappointing me (apart from Cheese and Crackers who imports their fish overnight) but the fish was surprisingly fresh and they gave me considerable chunks of fish for my nigiri. Delicious white tuna by the way.  I'd definitely go back for the sushi. If they ever change the ramen or I'm super desperate for some at 2:00 AM or something I'll give this place another try.  *Also there were little things I really liked about the place like the atmosphere, the little pipettes they use for soy sauce, and especially the fact that they give you an entire jug of water for your table."}
{"text":"After waiting for more than 75 minutes (were told 30-40 minutes) for a party of 3, we were utterly disappointed. We had all three ramen (Shoyu, Tonkotsu, and Miso) and an order of the Sakanaya specialty roll. The sushi was pretty decent but nothing special for the price. I guess I shouldn't be expecting too much but I was really hoping to like the ramen. The Shoyu ramen was really salty but the other two were lacking in taste.   The staff were all really nice but our waiter wasn't very attentive which added to the extra hour of waiting for my bill, paying, etc. Even though the food was a little so-so, I really love the new concept and the fancy modern addition to Green street! But I'm sadly to say that I might not be coming too often until the big hype is over. Glad they brought something different and new to campus!"}
{"text":"Sakanaya is one of the few saving grace sushi restaurants in Champaign. It's got a very modern and relaxed atmosphere which is perfect for a cozy dinner.   I've gone several times, having gotten the hotate and tako nigiri which were both really fresh. I would recommend getting the Una Q and Spider if are still new to sushi, otherwise the standard raw rolls were up to snuff.  What I will say about Sakanaya is that for once I had an unagi roll that had an ample amount of eel on it! I haven't gone to a sushi place in champaign that actually gives you that much actual sea food, let alone seafood that's fresh.   I recommend getting here early or calling to see availability, because the restaurant can probably only seat 30 guests. Don't be afraid to flag down your waitress too, as they sometime's are a little slow."}
{"text":"Only tried the sushi...Playboy & Spider. The ingredients were fresh, the textures good. I loved their spicy tuna! The ramen looked tantalizing enough to warrant a sampling. So this is a review that will require updating, but that's also reason enough for other folks to try it out!  UPDATE: Their ramen is nice, and it's the perfect entree for a chilly night because their base is just so simple and flavourful and fresh and warmth-inducing. Their sushi and ramen indicates that their selection of ingredients is pretty solid."}
{"text":"I started coming here recently and everything is fantastic. The fish is fresh and there is a lot of variety. I rarely get appetizers, but the Willis Tower is amazing. I get that appetizer every time I come here. I also enjoy the K2 and spider rolls, as well as the Windy City roll. The chicken katsu and ramen is also delicious. After 9pm, there is a late night menu where there is fried chicken that is extremely flavorful. The only knock against Sakanaya is sometimes the wait time is extremely long and they don't take reservations. So keep in mind, if you want to eat at a high traffic time, sometimes you may have to wait upwards of an hour."}
{"text":"Willis tower. 'Nough said! Fast service and sushi-feel inside..usually a big wait around dinner time so suggest going around 7-9. Miso soup is always a good start as well."}
{"text":"Sakanaya is consistently very good. The Willis Tower is a unique appetizer worth trying. I'm not the biggest fan of some of their signature sushi rolls, but I chalk it up to personal preference. They're still good. Their lunch combos are very good, as are ramen and chicken wings. They use quality ingredients and have good customer service. I come back regularly and have no hesitations about trying new things here.  It can get pretty busy even on week nights, I recommend reserving a table ahead with OpenTable for dinner."}
{"text":"Good sushi with awesome beautiful presentation. The price is a little high."}
{"text":"The food is of high quality and the ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Gold flakes were a nice touch."}
{"text":"We thought the food was wonderful. Hot, spicy flavorful Ramen. HOWEVER, the egg wa totally overcooked which seemed like such a shame.  The water jars with the definition of water on the side of the bottle gave us a little chuckle so I will still give this place four stars, mainly because the food was basically amazing. The egg though. Shameful."}
{"text":"my second time trying sushi, delish!"}
{"text":"For people who knows what a good sushi is I wouldn't recommend going here. Raw fish tasted like plastic and was not fresh. I've been here twice but only ended up eating chicken wings"}
{"text":"I must have been hangry bc when I was when I was quoted a 20 min wait at 5:30 on a Thursday, I was half deflated-half irritated and for a flash, thought about a plan B for dinner.  It's great that Sakanaya's business seems to be thriving!  By the numbers... 40: approximate number of guests the small restaurant seats. 10: actual number of minutes I had to wait for my table.  1: check-in on Yelp that'll score you a free bowl of miso soup. 14: dollars it'll cost ya for an order of bulgogi, and let me tell you, was I craving bulgogi that week!  Entree also comes with soup, bowl of white rice, salad, 2 little dumplings, and 2 pieces of sushi.  Boom. Nigiri: not a number, but fun to say, and I thoroughly enjoyed my yellowtail and fatty salmon ones ($3-4 apiece).  Waitress Sophia was so pleasant!  Glad Yelp tipped me off to yet another fine establishment.  Last note: you won't find street parking on Green St.  Look on the side streets, but make sure you have coins to feed the meters!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had. The ramen is so flavorful and comforting. The Soju mojito is my favorite drink.  Best restaurant in Champaign and that says a lot because Champaign's restaurant selection is pretty solid."}
{"text":"Sakanaya is a great local sushi restaurant with wonderful ambience. I really enjoy the decor and presentation of the location, and the sushi and food is beautiful as well.   If you are looking for a more affordable sushi dinner, this is probably not the place for you. The fish is very fresh and extremely high quality. We ordered an assortment of sushi and I was very satisfied with our meal.   4 stars because if you'd like to eat here, seating is very limited and you will likely be waiting for a very long time (unless you go during university breaks!). Word of note: they *do* offer takeout, and we have definitely taken advantage of that!"}
{"text":"One of the best and nicest restaurant on campus. The ramen and bento are very delicious and enough to fill you up. I would recommend to go with your friends and families, really! Also the wings are good for late night. So, don't forget to order them when you go eat at late night."}
{"text":"Easily our favorite sushi in Champaign-Urbana! The only one that knows how to make a proper avocado roll."}
{"text":"Good presentation, great staff and service, appropriate atmosphere, and delicious food.  Try: Willis tower (worth the money), salmon lovers dish, and all the rest  Don't try: ramen or that fancy lobster tail shell roll   I will certainly be back for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Some of the best quality Japanese food in town. Though you will pay for the quality. Portions are not super generous either. But regardless its a nice place with quality food."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It's a campus restaurant, but the quality is sky-high with affordable price. My boyfriend and I love this place so much, that it is our favorite dating spot. Doubtlessly, we almost tried all kinds of sushi rolls the restaurant carries. My personal favorite is their Sakanaya Roll (d'uh).   Their ramen is also wonderful. It gives my tommy a good pat after (usually) long days of classes/dues/papers. I was still talking about how Sakanaya has the best ramen when I had the world-famous ramen in Little Tokyo in California, and that is how good it is.   For their appetizers, my favorite are their Takosu, and Wills Tower. Both of them are cold appetizers, but they are both satisfying in their own unique ways. Their Takosu contains big pieces of meaty and refreshing octopus, and their Wills Tower is a little bit salty, but it stimulates my taste bud way too well for me to stop.   If you are going late at night, their chicken wings and twist potato are some must-tries. Too much spoilers for you all, now go try it by yourselves."}
{"text":"Extraordinary interior and display of food!!!  Ramen noodle could have been better, tastes like instant ramen somehow"}
{"text":"We came here for the wings. They were delicious! Half and half was great, so you get some spicy some not spicy. Good ambiance, and fast service."}
{"text":"Great sushi! The lunch special is a great deal for the quality of food. I only wish the space was larger so it was easier to get a table."}
{"text":"I know it might be weird, but they have the best chicken wings ever! They're crisped to perfection & flavored just enough. I always order half & half of both flavors. Obviously the sushi is pretty damn amazing but it's so cool that the other items on the menu don't fall short. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend for lunch during the work day. What should have taken one hour took almost two. The food took too long to arrive and later the check did too. The menu is small, but well chosen. The green tea has a lovely roasty flavor; it was well brewed.   I had the spicy shoyu ramen and my friend had the tekka don. She was very happy with the tekka don (eel and veg over rice). I liked the ramen pretty well. It had a spicy broth with just a hint of richness. I'd like more depth in my broth, and more tenderness in the meat in the bowl, but I was pleased that the dish wasn't tame.   For a small, campus-town restaurant, this one has a calm, grown-up atmosphere. It's clean and quiet with quality food. The prices are not low, but the value is decent."}
{"text":"I was visiting the University of Illinois and saw this restaurant on the drive over. There was a huge line so you could tell this was the place to be! I was a little nervous about trying sushi in Illinois, but this place is a gem!! The wait was about 15 minutes, and the service was incredible. They took our order and the sushi was out super quick considering the place was packed. The fish was very fresh and the chicken teriyaki was a huge entree. Over all a totally delicious meal. Definitely would recommend a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place in town. I love their sashimi, sushi, they are so fresh. Tasted awesome.  Ramen is also excellent.  After eating here, it is hard for me to go to the other sushi places in town."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and it didn't disappoint this time around. Thankfully they have the No Wait app so you can put your name in instead of standing in the small hallway waiting to be seated, because you will be there for a while if you go without a reservation. This place has quality sushi but it seems a little overpriced compared to other places on campus but it's a very nice higher end atmosphere which I don't mind paying for when I've had enough fast food. Overall a good experience, the geoza was very very good and the edamame perfectly cooked and salted. The tools were very tasty as well! I would recommend to anyone willing to spend a little more for good quality food or looking for a romantic spot for date night on campus!"}
{"text":"Best place on campus to eat quality sushi, ramen, rice dish, wings, and more. The prices are expensive because everything tastes high quality. If you want seats, go in early because there is almost always a wait! You can come to Sakanaya for a date, casual dinner, or birthday celebration; this place is perfect for any occasion! I wish there were more tables and space inside the restaurant, but I like the exclusivity feel to it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and ramen! I almost always get their miso soup, shrimp tempura rolls, and another sushi roll or ramen The service is excellent, and the wait times are short during the summer."}
{"text":"Having tried almost every at least halfway-decent restaurant around campus, we finally decided to give Sakanaya a try - and we even got so lucky that we did not encounter any line whatsoever when coming in. The time we saved there got quickly taken away from us when we were waiting around 10 minutes to get our orders taken. I guess there might be a slight correlation between this and the waiters blindly looking straight in front of them instead of looking around for guests that might be ready to order or to pay - no hard feelings.  Eventually, we decided to go for the Una Don: Grilled Eel served in a bowl of rice with vegetables.   The free water was served in a gracefully designed vase with nicely designed cups - that really added to the atmosphere. Also you get served some soup along with your main entree - the soup itself was nothing special, but it was for free, so I leave it at that.  The main entree itself cut both ways, so to speak. The eel was super delicious and I could have devoured a lot more of that. Being accompanied with the typical sushi sauces as well as wasabi and pickled ginger, the entire bowl tasted more like a dissected, big piece of sushi roll. This can be good or bad, depending on what you expected. Since I deliberately did not go for the sushi, but for this dish, should say enough with respects to what I had expected. Nonetheless, the entire flavor and taste was satisfying and I would recommend it because of the eel served with it. However, be aware of that the description \"[...]with vegetable\" should not be taken literally in the sense of that serving something with three small pieces of ginger, a tea spoon of wasabi and two small pieces of carrots and yellow pepper already counts as serving something \"with vegetables\".   The atmosphere is upscale, which I liked for a change if you are used to dining in more \"casual\" places as you find them all around campus. That comes with a more upscale pricing also, of course.  Don't get me wrong - this place is definitely worth a visit and I enjoyed it, even though this review might sound a little negative. I just had the above described dish and this review is based upon that and the atmosphere I encountered. I cannot speak for the sushi and the ramen they serve, which is said to be really good. Given that, I will certainly come back to try those dishes out and reconsider my rating - but for now it's a good and solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place on campus for fine dining sushi. The menu is full of great options and the fish is very fresh. It is a bit expensive for on campus dining but definitely worth the money. Everything is full of flavor and you pay for the quality. The presentation is also great and the service was fast and helpful.  Restaurant is small so wait time for a table is long but if you use the app NoWait you can get in line through the app and see how long the wait is until your table is ready and you will get a text when it is."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful. A must try if in the area.   Sakanaya  exceeded my expectations. I would never expected sushi in Chambana to taste better than most sushi in Chicago for a lesser price. This is not to say the menu items are within the average college students budget, but a California roll at a $5-$6 is not bad. But if you're like me, you want and crave the prober items which were pretty reasonable.   I love Sushi $25 (10 pc sushi) - 5 stars  Tuna Tatami $12-$14 - 4 stars   Willis Tower $12- a serious show stopper; 5 stars  (My favorite item)   Miso Soup, free with Yelp check in - 5 stars  Ambiance - 5 stars   Service - 5 stars; the hostess takes your name and number. If you leave, you are sent a text message when your table is ready"}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting my sister for the weekend. We went during lunch time on a Saturday, missed the peak lunch rush and went in at about 1:25-1:30pm. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our seats--which was fine. I understand that there aren't many tables inside. But at about 1:51 (I looked down to check my watch), there were several people who came in to put their names down and the host started turning people away because it was \"too close to 2:00\"--which is when their kitchens close and they start preparing for dinner. NOW, from my experience, it is APPALLING for you to turn away customers before the official closing time of 2:00pm. THIS IS JUST BAD SERVICE, and if i was the one that was turned away, I would've raised a bit of a scene. Felt bad for all the couples/groups that got turned away that day. I don't know if this is a regular thing for Sakanaya or if it was a one-time occurrence, but word of advice--don't turn your customers away because it's too close to kitchen turning time. And don't be crying when your customers start going to some of the other competitors in the area because THEY'RE not turning away customers.   My sister got the Tonkotsu ramen and I got their 8pc sashimi lunch special. The ramen was subpar--too bland and their broth wasn't the right consistency--that thick, flavorful Tonkotsu ramen consistency. My sashimi was extremely fresh--the one good part about this experience. And the sushi roll was perfectly average--nothing mind-blowing or not extremely bad either. If it wasn't so overpriced, i would say that the sashimi is pretty much the only thing going for this restaurant.  Overall restaurant service was pretty bad too. From the hosts to the servers. Our server brought us our check even before we finished our meal and started cleaning our dishes too soon. It was obvious they were trying to rush us out of there.   All-in-all, Sakanaya had average food for being slightly overpriced--but even the fresh sashimi can be overlooked because of their service. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best vibe in Champaign for restaurants. Very modern interior and professional waitstaff. I've been here several times while I was out here in Champaign and none disappointed.   The ramen is good, sushi is much better than any others in Champaign, and appetizers are delicious! This place will definitely be successful. It's on the higher end in terms of pricing compared to everything else on the street, but you need to treat yourself every now and then. It's on the further end of Green St, but worth the trek.  Be sure to try their sushi and ramen out! Their specials have always been delicious!"}
{"text":"If anyone in champaign wants sushi that is delicious, fresh and fun. Head to sakanaya. Not only do they have rolls that are on fire by lighting Bacardi with a flame and rolls with bonito flakes on them that actually move, but their ingredients are the freshest I have ever tasted. It's not your standard boring rolls that are at all the other sushi restaurants in town. The food is delicious at lunch or dinner or late night and the staff is always fun and fast. If I could I would have sakanaya every night of the week. Actually this has happened in the past and it's never gotten old."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times, and have been wowed every time.  Sakanaya makes some of the best sushi I have ever had. The fish comes from a good supplier in Chicago, and it always served at an optimal temperature where the fat from the fish is just starting to melt and the rice is a little warmer than body temperature. This sushi is legit, and you should eat it as soon as it gets to your table to preserve that perfect temperature balance. I recommend the simple stuff like nigiri, sashimi, chirashi, or hamachi rolls, but their crazy rolls are fun too.  Their chicken wings are incredible. Korean style fried chicken is one of the most underrated foods out there, and Sakanaya has it down to an art. Sweet garlic sauce saturates crispy skin and batter that has puffed out and separated from the juicy meat. These wings are perfect in every way and should be on your bucket list. If you're a student, pick up some wings on a night out!  They also have a very creative selection of appetizers. The Willis Tower is a fun one. Its fish egg, spicy tuna, crab, avocado, and sushi rice layered in that order from top to bottom with some sauces on the plate. Its kind of like a big california roll.  With their high quality food, friendly and helpful service, and interesting menu items, Sakanaya really is an elite restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing from food to the decor and overall environment. Hands down new favorite spot in Champaign. How good is it? Well we went there for dinner and same night came back for the late night menu and the wings were just as delicious as the sushi rolls and the ramen we had earlier that evening. Absolutely a must try."}
{"text":"Best sushi on campus. Nice atmosphere and nice waiters/waitresses. Also had a Japanese beer which was good. I've been to a lot of restaurants during my stay in Champaign-Urbana and Sakanaya is one of the nicest."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. The fish is remarkably fresh and the atmosphere is surprisingly intimate for a campus joint. I had the gold rush and K2 rolls and both were phenomenal. Also tried a couple of their nigiri and those were excellent as well. Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes sushi."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Great sushi. Wish the wait time was a little easier. But its worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place! Philly roll was outstanding. Kamikaze was really good but almost overbearing on the spiciness. Green tea tastes as if we're infused with soy sauce so I didn't drink it but I wasn't charged for it either. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"In Chambana for a workshop/graduate class, and searched for the best sushi place in town via yelp. Sakayana lived up to all the positive reviews!! Absolutely BEST, freshest iced green tea I have ever experienced. Willis tower app was delish, decor was modern & relaxed & staff was very well informed!!!   LOVE this place"}
{"text":"Just finished our meal and can some it up in one word - incredible!  Great service and great food!  Well worth a wait!"}
{"text":"We came there and put my name and number and decided to wait there as the servent told us that it would save us more time. However, 30 mins later, we still haven't got any reponses, so we asked the girl who helped us before and was told that my name was not on the list despite the fact that I did receive their text when I told her to put my name into the list. Th girl also said that she didn't remember us and didn't apologize for ignoring our 30 minutes of waiting at the restaurant.15 minutes later, she came to us and walked us to an available table. Soon, a text came in saying my table was ready. Haha, wont go to that place anymore."}
{"text":"Favorite Japanese place in c-u! Quick, consistent and attentive service with outstanding quality fish and cooked items. Lunch combos are a good deal. I wish they'd do prepacked items for takeout and sell them for slightly lower price than their sit down prices."}
{"text":"Really great sushi! A little bit pricy but definitely worth it for the quality of food. I can't wait to go back and try the noodle dishes. Go here-- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've always had really good experiences at Sakanaya whether it be the take-away or a sit down meal. It is a bit pricey, but the fish is as fresh as your can get in the middle of nowhere. Plus, they're the only place I know that has uni which isn't old.  If you want to save some money consider getting their lunch specials. They range in price but the most you'll pay is about $15 for sushi plus miso soup. I opt in for that if my bank account is low.  Their sit down service is always friendly and nice. Sometimes there's a little wait for dishes when they're super busy but the time quickly flies with friends."}
{"text":"This place was great! They had probably the best hwe dup bop I've ever had, with bits of seasonal apple along with the more standard toppings. We also tried some sparkly Korean blackberry wine, which even though it sounds like it might be sickly sweet, is actually malty and refreshing and goes well with food. They also threw on an unexpected side order of chicken wings, which I thought were super-tasty and I don't even really like fried things all that much. Would eat again."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Sashimi and nigiri are huge compared to competitors. Wish they had a bigger bar selection or cocktails. But still amazing."}
{"text":"Probably the coolest looking reasonably priced restaurant in champaign il. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our food, especially the sushi. Really good place for a date night!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean restaurant. The I love Tuna combo plate was excellent, as well as the OMG, White Emperor, and the K2 rolls. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgebale about the menu. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tasty sushi! Great selection of rolls at a decent price.Service was quick and polite.If you're in town and craving sushi highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sakanaya has become my favorite place for sushi in town.  The nigiri are very well made, the fish always tastes excellent, and the prices are on par with other sushi places in town.  I recommend the Sakanaya Supreme special: nigiri, sashimi, and two rolls for $55.  My husband and I rarely finish it in one sitting, so it's nice to have a snack for later.  The service is nice and friendly without being obtrusive.    But I'll stand by what I said in my earlier review: don't get the ramen.  ;)"}
{"text":"I probably eat at Sakanaya more than my wallet can comfortably handle, but I keep coming back because it's a better than average sushi place with lots of other food choices. I write this review in the context of the UIUC campus in which Sakanaya is definitely as good as it gets for sushi, so 5 stars instead of 4 if this was located in DT Champaign or Urbana.   Their menu has been relatively consistent throughout the 4 years I've been here. My go-to's are:  -Willis Tower (to share): it comes out super quick, so you can start eating right away (especially if you've been waiting 45 minutes for a table). It's a little tower with rice, spicy tuna crab, and some avocado that you can break up and mix on the plate. Super fun and delicious! At $12 or $6/person for 2 people, it's not a bad deal. -Chicken wings: they're SO good! Korean style with two flavors: soy garlic and hot&spicy, but I usually go for half-half.  Definitely a must try for lunch or late night (they don't have them at dinner). -OMG and VIP rolls: If you really want to impress that hot date, get one of these rolls that are served with actual flames on the side. They both taste pretty good and are exciting for a special occasion. -their platters are also good to share with someone if you're really feeling a certain kind of raw fish. my favorite is the I Love Salmon. -their sashimi is kind of pricey for a campus restaurant, so if you're craving, I'd recommend just getting the sampler. It comes with 3 salmon, 2 tuna and 2 escolar (I think).  Obviously, not the highest quality, but it's more affordable if you're getting other items too -Ramen: more than acceptable for the price! Portions are great, but the broth is just okay. Overall, not bad for $13-14 if you compare how much you're getting vs 1 roll.  There isn't much seating space inside, so during dinner times, it can get really busy (like longer than 1hr wait busy), but if you come right at opening or with smaller party, you can get seated right away or with a shorter wait time. If you have a party larger than 5, I would avoid coming during busy times. Staff are usually pretty accommodating for larger parties, I've been here with 8 people before, but only if there's not a huge line of people.   Ambiance is also really good for a campus restaurant. Dim lighting and industrial style lamps make it feel pretty intimate."}
{"text":"My first visit was great.   The service was kind and efficient.  I ordered the sushi lunch special.  It was delicious.   I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Holy crap.  When I came to visit my baby brother in college (where the heck is Urbana-Champaign, anyways??), I thought that I would be eating the run-of-the-mill college food.  Mentally prepared for dry burgers and overcooked pasta, I was nearly weeping with joy when I saw that there was a good sushi place.  Sakanaya did not disappoint.  My brother and I had the Playgirl and the normal spicy tuna and salmon avocado rolls.  The Playgirl was DELICIOUS (how do you fit that much crunchy flavor into one bite?).  The spicy tuna also came in chunks rolling in spicy sauce, none of that nasty mayo stuff.  It was so good we practically inhaled it.  It is a small restaurant, so if you come during a prime time there will be a short wait.  It was around 20 minutes for us at 6:30 PM on a Sunday, so not enough to deter me next time.  Now that we discovered Sakanaya, I may be a leeetttle more inclined to come visit UIUC again.  Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Service A+++ Food A+++ Atmosphere A+++ Some of the best, most fresh Sushi, & Nigiri I have ever had. The chicken Katsu was amazing!! If you live in Champaign or are in the area, get there!!"}
{"text":"Most overrated restaurant in Champaign. Their sushi is at best a 6/10 if you ever eaten sushi in a coastal state.  Their prices are stupidly expensive and beyond overpriced.  This is the type of place you go to show someone you have a lot of money but you can't pronounce Unagi."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, the VIP with tempura and salmon was  mind blowing. Will recommend for a nice brunch"}
{"text":"Quality is great in Champaign-Urbana, and I really appreciate the quick service too. Always have to start with the Willis Tower before you get anything else!! I'd recommend the Sakanaya roll and the Playgirl roll!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for what you're getting but great quality and ambiance. Perfect spot for a date!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Right on university campus but without too many students. The Sushi, Rolls and Ramen are great. I drank Korean rice wine and sparkling peach sake, both were delicious.   The restaurant has a Korean twist on Japanese udon, making it spicy. Personally not a favorite.   But I will go again for sushi, ramen and drinks."}
{"text":"Great late night food on Fridays and Saturdays, even if it's a bit expensive. I especially like the chicken wings and the Willis Tower - a huge roll of sushi with tuna and avocado. However, the line can get long at around dinner time or late night, so reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Sakanaya. By far the best sushi we have had in the Midwest, including Chicago! We highly recommend the Sakanaya & White Emperor Rolls. The place is small but very modern. The wait staff is friendly and professional. We had fun looking at all of the plates being delivered to other tables. We can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Food is superb! Everything I had was perfect. Only the donkatsu was a little tough in my opinoin. Other than that the rolls, sashimi, ramen were all so good. Hwe dup bab (Korean sashimi rice bowl) is even better than the bowl i had in Korea.  However the portion is too small, and the price is too expensive. Need to order like 4 dishes to be full for two people, which will cost something like $80. Or just have two dishes and leave not feeling full."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. A bit pricey if you want sushi; it'll be about $20+ for a good meal. Ramen is priced better, around $13. My main gripe is that it gets super crowded during evenings, and they don't take reservations over phone.. and when you walk in to make make a reservation, if you're not there when you receive their text they will give the seats to people behind you in line (happened to me, and it pisses me off). Good food, though."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. I'd say it's probably the best tasting sushi in Urbana-Champaign. A tad pricey, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had yet. Great service and stunning atmosphere. I get sushi here one a week! Sometimes to-go and it's still fantastic service and delicious! It's a standout."}
{"text":"The best sushi in CU. always fresh and the presentation is outstanding. Their chicken wings are AMAZING also."}
{"text":"Definitely make sure to show up early. The tables filled up quick when they opened up for dinner hours at 5pm.  I ordered the Bulgoki and my friend ordered the Miso Ramen. The Bulgoki was visually pleasing. I had never gotten Bulgoki with a side salad, two sushi pieces, and two pieces of crispy tofu. I felt like it was worth the price for what I got. I've spent about $12 for Bulgogi at other restaurants, but it was only the meat and rice. So Sakanaya gave a nice addition. I also thought it was a good way to still put a little Japanese influence in the dish. For the Miso Ramen, it was tasty. It was a big bowl of Ramen definitely not something you can find elsewhere on Green St. The pork was very tender and the broth just made it taste better.  Overall, it was a good food night. I definitely recommend Sakanaya if you want a nice place to go for dinner. The food's taste matches the decor: awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty good food: if you want sushi in Champaign, this is your place."}
{"text":"A tight little Japanese place. The prices are pretty reasonable given the standards in town and the quality of the food. The sushi and sashimi are fresh and the staff are always really friendly and attentive even though it gets pretty bonkers during lunchtime. I did get charged for a tiny dollop of spicy paste once when I asked for it after I got my meal."}
{"text":"FINALLY. I've been waiting for Urbana-Champaign to open up a Japanese ramen shop and one has finally opened. With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint.   Location is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us.   Prices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh.   Tl;dr?  - Sushi and ramen are good. Get it.  - Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place.  - Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper. Where else can you buy authentic Japanese ramen here, anyway?"}
{"text":"We were totally surprised to find such a fantastic sushi place in Champagne/Urbana's Uni of Illinois district. The sushi was fresh and yummy and we are very picky. The service was impeccable. Great place; great find!"}
{"text":"For Champaign, the sushi and ramen are definitely the best quality on campus. The waitstaff is decently nice, and the ambiance is really cool. I would definitely pay a couple of extra bucks for the ramen here, rather than eat super mediocre to bad ramen elsewhere.   The sushi rolls are pretty good, really fresh and flavorful. I like that they have character, like the VIP roll. I also LOVE the Willis Tower (even though I hate the name). You get to smash it and enjoy the spice and salt an deliciousness. The salmon and tuna platters are also worth the price, very fresh.   The tonkatsu ramen and shoyu ramen are my favorites. Very good flavorful broth and tender not overly cooked noodles with many toppings.  I would DEFINITELY recommend the twist potato and the friend chicken. Be warned the spicy chicken is very spicy, and the garlic is sweet and salty. They are juicy, crunchy and overall delicious. Pretty big too. They're only served late night though."}
{"text":"Trying Japanese food with enjoyable place and kindness server make me feel won stay long and trays any kind of sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Champaign - period. Really fresh fish and interesting roll combinations. It's unfortunate (to me) it's on campus though. Parking can be tough and make sure to get there early to avoid a long wait time - it's a small dinning room. Try the sparkling peach sake."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very cute and aesthetic but quite small. The waits can get long to be dotted but always 100% worth the wait. Keep an eye out for hours they close after lunch and before dinner. Such a great place much order Willis tower"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The location is convenient for students and the ambience is great for a good meal.   Cali crunch roll - the crunch did not overpower the taste of the crab. OMG roll - this is a must try. They bring it on a sizzling plate on flames. The sauce on top is amazing and goes really well with soy sauce and wasabi.  Chicken wings - tried both flavors hot n spicy and garlic soy. They were good but I don't think I'll have them again.   Overall it's one of the best places on campus and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The Sushi is great! The Service is great! Fresh sashimi and you can see how they make sushis. Good place for sushi fans. A little pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new sushi places to try out and happened to stumble upon Sakanaya. The restaurant was very nice looking, having a cool, modern vibe. It was pretty busy when we arrived, and we just managed to snag the last open table. We were waited on fairly quickly and got served our food about 10-15 minutes after ordering.   I thought the Willis Tower appetizer was amazing. It looked beautiful and tasted awesome. It does run a little pricey at $12, but it's a lot of food.   The sashimi and yaya roll plate combo was alright. While the sashimi tasted incredibly clean, fresh, and wonderful, I was not as wowed by the yaya roll. I felt that it was rather greasy for sushi since the roll is encrusted with tempura and then fried, and the ingredients within the roll itself just didn't go very well together. Overall, I did enjoy my experience at Sakanaya. It sells really good sashimi and sushi among other things, but I would stay away from the yaya roll!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family since my cousin recommended this place. We got there around lunch time on a Friday after Thanksgiving and the place was pretty packed. Even with a reservation, we had to wait probably around 10-15 minutes.  We ordered the wings for the appetizer which actually came last because our waiter said wings tend to take longer. My cousin ordered a sushi tower of sorts which actually was quite delicious.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which was quite good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was quite rich and tasty. The diced onions were a nice addition since they provided a nice crunch.  Waiters were all friendly. 4 stars since this one waiter dropped some plates twice while we were eating."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious sushi! I was in town traveling for work and followed the great reviews to see for myself. It was awesome! Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised in Champaign.  I never really had sushi in Champaign when I was a college student but these UIUC kids have been going fancy these days.  We came an hour before closing and it was packed.. in fact, they told us they weren't sure if we could even get seated or fed.  Luckily, it worked...  - If you can drink, I would get the hot sake... the bottle is big. - The slices of sashimi are thick.  It's been since Boston I have seen slices that thick.  And I would say that if you get the sashimi sushi dinner for a little more than $30.. it's a really good deal.  Let's not go too crazy and say it's the best sushi ever.. I've had fresher sashimi... but it's pretty good for Champaign."}
{"text":"Sushi is one of, if not the best, in town. Signature rolls start at about $12 and go up to $18. Certainly comparable with KoFusion. Service has been good, wait staff is friendly. This place gets very crowded, so it can be loud. Go early, put your name in, and grab a beer at Legends while you wait, there is an app that will let you know your wait time and when you are ready to be seated. It is less than pleasant to wait in their small foyer, but worth it."}
{"text":"Really like this Japanese Restaurant, sushi is really exquisite and noodles are also good."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was so fresh! Will definitely be back. Sushi is the best in champaign hands down."}
{"text":"Things sure have changed in Campustown since my student days. I swear it looks like downtown Chicago landed from the sky with all of the tall buildings and fancy lampposts and well-dressed Millennials hanging out. Gone are so many traditions, such as the Coed Theaters or Mabel's, while others like Garcia's and Record Service have been trundled off to the nether regions of Chambana.   And while the 80's may have belonged to the Illini, they certainly didn't include sushi. If sushi were available, I doubt it would have been of the amazing quality that is offered today at Sakanaya. With a cozy, warm but modern theme, Sakanaya is tucked in along Green Street and serves the campus community with the best sushi in town.  Amazing sushi requires both absolute freshness and skilled preparation, and this place delivers both. Those with a fish fetish will find the chirashi to be quite delicious with large portions of fish put forth with artistry and flair. The nigiri sushi is just as good with buttery slabs of hamachi  (yellowtail) and sake (salmon) piled upon seasoned rice.  Kitchen preparations are also good. My favorite is the tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet) served traditionally with shredded cabbage and rice. I haven't tried ramen or soba here but I look forward to doing that soon.  Service is attentive generally speaking. Prices aren't cheap but good food generally isn't. The only problem I have is that now that I'm no longer a student, it can be hard to find parking nearby. For me though, that's a minor quibble. Sakanaya is well worth the journey to Campustown. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Sakanaya! I have had many of their rolls and have enjoyed each. I love their ramen and the hot appetizers have also impressed. We were most impressed by the quality of their smoked salmon sushi.   After finding Sakanaya, we will not be getting sushi from any other restaurant in town.   The one annoyance is that you need to go onto campus and find parking. However, it is totally worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"I loved absolutely everything about eating here. The sushi is the best I've had, and far superior than other restaurants in Champaign. I know other people say that the ramen may be overpriced, but the portions are huge and delicious. I love the interior and all the little details they took into consideration (the glasses, the authentic wood pieces)... The service was also amazing. You must try the Korean soju! the most unique drink I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten here. But I just read a review by some dumdum who is butthurt because they wouldn't let him bring McDonald's into the restaurant so his kids had something to shove down their gaping maws while the adults enjoyed their sushi. So hopefully these 5 stars help offset that 1 star...but based on the other glowing reviews, you don't really need it.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"A good sushi restaurant in Central Illinois? Yeah, I had my doubts too. But Sakanaya is here to make you a believer. This coming from a Southern CA native.  The fish was fresh and the rolls were inventive. Looking forward to trying the ramen next time!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Sakanaya on a business trip October 9, 2017. Many students from UIUC were there. I made reservation online. I was there a little after reserved time as free parking can be scarce. However, I was seated quite promptly. Order was take very quickly. I had the \"I love Salmon\" platter. It was excellent. Top quality salmon. Excellent taste. Very attentive service."}
{"text":"Solid Food but just have to wait for a long time when there's people before you. The Alligator is epic!"}
{"text":"ive only tried their late night menu. The wait was long, but the wings were really good. I felt like it was trying to be too cool though, which always turns me off of a place. I prefer yellow fin, which is quiet and you can appreciate the food more."}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about this place - it was pretty hyped up by friends. Because of this, though, I expected a lot. During the course of the meal I got the impression that Sakanaya was putting more emphasis on putting off a \"fancy\" vibe than they were with the actual distinctiveness of what they offer. Overall, though, it's still definitely the best option for sushi in the area. I give it 5 stars for that."}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise! Restaurant interior design set the tone for a special meal-very modern. Wait staff were polite and attentive. Meal was absolutely delicious. 5 people in our party, so we tried many sushi, entrees and soups and everything had a fresh flavor. Prices more reasonable than other sushi places in town, but sushi was still awesome. Located on Green Street yet easy to find parking on a nearby side street."}
{"text":"Great place, really nice servers. Sushi was fresh. Options weren't very vast but the quality and experience overall was great. I would return when I'm the area again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant in town!! Has the great ambience and the food is perfect always looking forward to be here again."}
{"text":"I do not say this lightly - this is my favorite restaurant in the world. Everything about it is absolutely perfect. I've been there at least 20 times, and each time I fall more and more in love with the modern atmosphere, amazing fresh sushi, and fair prices for such an experience. I get that the signature rolls might be considered by some to be on the expensive side, but they're so worth it for me. I can't eat sushi at any other place now, just because my bar for good sushi is sky high now. If you can only go to one restaurant in the Chambana area, go here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. It's a little small, so prepare to wait at prime dining hours. We had the sakanaya and kamikaze rolls and fatty salmon to share. The sakanaya roll was particularly good- crab, avocado, and salmon, topped with scallop and fish flakes. Really, really good. One of the better sushi rolls I've had at any sushi place. Both rolls were nicely presented. Fatty salmon is my weakness, and Sakanaya's is very expensive per piece ($9!) but it was pretty worth it tonight. While it wasn't the best piece I've ever had, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. If you ever get the chance, you need to try fatty salmon! For the rest of our meal, we had tonkatsu ramen. I have to say, I wasn't blown away by the ramen. I'd give it three stars. The broth was the right color and consistency, but it really lacked the richness and pork flavor that tonkatsu ramen should have. It just tasted a little thin and bland. Definitely need to work on that. The noodles themselves were nice and chewy, so no complaints about that. Meat was tasty, but cut pretty thin. Thumbs down for the egg, which was hard boiled and cold... Skimpy on the bamboo shoots. I was happy about the noodles, but the rest of the ramen was just okay.   Overall, I'd give Sakanaya 3.5 stars. The sushi is great but I think the ramen could be improved a lot. I'd love to explore the rest of the menu some time. I'll definitely be back, at least for sushi!  UPDATE: Ramen still needs work. Still lacking richness and flavor that truly good ramen has. Had to add soy sauce to the tonkatsu at my last visit. Otherwise, sushi is still excellent, probably the best on campus!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We decided to go out for sushi on a Tuesday night and heard good things about Sakanaya.  The restaurant is pretty small on the inside, but well-decorated and very modern looking, I felt like I was at a fancy place downtown or something!  We started with miso soup and a bokbunjajoo Korean raspberry wine. The soup was simple and good, but still nice because we got it for free by checking in on Yelp! The wine was fantastic, I've never had anything like it and it had a sweet flavor to it that separated it from western wine I'm used to drinking.  I absolutely had to get sushi and my roommate was pretty set on ramen, so we ordered a Sakanaya roll and the shimp tempura ramen. My roll was superb! I believe it was salmon, crab salad, avocado, scallion and fish flake. Good feedback from his ramen too, which was a huge portion!  Overall I thought the food was good but perhaps a little pricey. The atmosphere was unique but a little cramped for our (really) little table of 2.  Authentic food in a cool atmosphere on campus, which is kind of hard to find but it comes at a price.  Strong 4/5."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and I have been blown away by the food and service both times. Staff is extremely courteous and attentive. The food is amazing! I've tried the OMG (the best), Philadelphia, Cali Crunch, California, Champaign-Urbana, Playboy (too spicy for my stomach, but still great), Miso Soup (which is just like any other miso soup), and the Chicken Teriyaki dinner (which comes with A LOT of food). I have nothing but good things to say about this place and even though I despise campus, this place will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I've been all over our country and had sushi at all levels and I'm not sure if these college kids just haven't had sushi or what?  This is nothing fancy. Flat tap water on every table. Your standard miso soup.   $17 for a lunch special got me maybe 3-4 ounces of meat and one roll that was pretty good but fried and prepared earlier. Usually sashimi is at least served over beds of rice for a little more fill.   The wasabi is very weak. Rice is kind of dry, I've had fuller rice."}
{"text":"Some of the best Asian food on campus. The hosts are very nice and the booking system for campus is awesome. They will take a reservation in person and call you when your spot is ready, so you don't have to wait endlessly at the restaurant.  Note: The seating can be more comfortable though!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in CU. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Service sets this place apart. Servers are efficient, friendly, and accommodating. Someone is always available to answer questions about the rotating rice wine/sake menu.   Fish is always fresh here and they are generous with sashimi sizes. I don't think that they have the largest selection/most unique rolls, but the ones they have are quality and beautiful.   It's a small space but we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table. Once in, you will completely forget that you're in the middle of green ST, save for all the students around you. Perfect vibe and decor for the food served. Even the soy sauce dispensers are great!"}
{"text":"My family went there this past Sunday for our second visit.  The place is beautiful and stylish, as are the way all things are presented.  The attention to the detail is evident in the choice of the water bottles, the soy sauce dispensers and all the glamourous black plates and chopsticks, as well as, the absolutely stunning way the dining room has been designed.  The staff is friendly and caring and the service is perfect.  All of that is great, but what ultimately makes a restaurant special is the food, and our family found the sushi at Sakanaya to be unbelievably fresh, varied and beautifully prepared & presented, and most importantly delicious.  This is just an amazing sushi bar.  We intend to try the Ramen on our next visit.  It looked beautiful when it wafted by.  Because Sakanaya has been so wholeheartedly embraced by the U of I student population,  be patient and be prepared for a wait, but the food and the environment make it all totally worthwhile(you can go hang out at a nearby bar or shop and they will call you when your table is ready).  We had a fantastic meal and great time.  If you love great food, then you owe it to yourself to check out Sakanaya.  One last note, I concur with Seth's comment re: the early and ignorant review. That was useless and not helpful at all.  Sakanaya is a great restaurant serving great food.    sometimes waiting for a table is worth it and if you consider the quality of the experience and the excellent food, then the value is high and huge.    Great place.  Go now."}
{"text":"I've been looking for Japanese cuisine restaurant at UIUC for the recent two weeks. It's a great place to visit if u wanna have sth special here"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Urbana Champaign period. Love the Willis tower, never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi place in Champaign. It explains why there's usually a line outside the door of this classy establishment. Keep in mind that Japanese restaurants tend to sacrifice quantity for quality and at Sakanaya, you are definitely paying for high quality food. The lunch and dinner menus are different and note that the lunch menu has lunch specials if you're looking to save some money. I hope they release their menu online sometime in the future."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait the evening we went. The staff was very contentious about checking in with us and letting us know how much longer we would be waiting for a table. The food was excellent with a nice atmosphere and above average service."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The presentation of the food is amazing. The wait staff is on point. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"OMG: FRESH SUSHI IN CHAMPAIGN!  FRESH SUSHI IN CHAMPAIGN!  After having given up on Sushi in town, given the near-rancid levels of fish you get at Yellowtail and Kofusion, this place has FANTASTIC FRESH FISH, great rolls, incredible udon and ramen.  My wife and I now eat here about once a week."}
{"text":"This restaurant impressed me with its attention to detail. Right from the get go- you have the laminate wood exterior, and the zen feel is all throughout the interior. The posh, slate colored trim and the dim oversized lightbulbs gives it an industrial flavor. You see the detail work in the silverware, menu, even the napkins... the ambiance outranks all of the other campus restaurants out there.   This meticulous attention is of course given to the food. I'm a bit picky about my sushi and I can say that the sushi here is fantastic. I've had their cold noodles and ramen as well. Like the sushi, they all have a balanced composition of flavor and texture.   Its definitely worth going to for a nice dinner out on campus."}
{"text":"Best sushi for the price in Chambana :) Their Udon noodle soup was also great. I would love to go back!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior. It borders on fancy but is still a Green St.  Place (very casual). The waiters are also very friendly amd courteous.  I had the salmon combo: sushi, nagiri,  and sashimi, which was $21-22. It definitely wasn't the best sushi I have ever had and I found the variety and freshness was lacking. Overall it wasn't terrible but wasn't great.  Exactly 3 stars makes perfect sense for this place."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi, although quite pricey, is honestly amazing. Their udons are the only item I haven't tried, and I look forward to it very, very soon.  Now, let's talk about the ramen. I would have given it five stars if not for the unfortunate fact that Sakanaya has no alternative to pork-based broth. The three previous times I dined here, I asked if they had any ramen that did not have anything pork based at all, to which I received a negative for an answer. The restaurant has a wonderful staff and is a really neat place to eat, but I'm deprived of a third of the menu, which happens to consist of my favorite Japanese dish."}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi you'll find in the Champaign area. If you would've asked me to rate Sakanaya a year ago it would've been a solid 4, but in recent weeks I have noticed their ramen -- what was once phenomenal and the what initially kept me coming back -- has significantly changed in flavor content, noodle type, and overall quality. I'm not sure if there has been a change in owner or staff, but the integrity of the ramen dishes have been severely compromised. The shrimp udon ramen -- what once consisted of thick udon noodles, a gooey egg, crispy tempura shrimp, and broth with an exceptional kick of flavor and spice -- has now been replaced by thin, flimsy ramen noodle soaked in a bland broth that I would honestly not care to order twice. This was really disappointing given that I used to hold there ramen to such a high standard!      Aside from this, there sushi has always been consistent and delicious! The rainbow roll has buttery, rich cuts of fish and lots of yummy, fresh avocado. I know they also have a popular dish that many tables share, sort of a \"volcano\" constructed out of rice, avocado, & different types of sashimi.      The service is amazing, the servers are always fast & super accommodating. The ambiance feels fresh & comfortable. There is always a dimmed lighting to accompany the fresh wood paneled type walls. The place is kept super clean and you can even see the cuts of fish displayed behind a clear window in the chefs station up in the front of the restaurant. It is somewhat of a narrow space considering how much business they attract, but they've definitely made it work for them.       I am still a huge fan & loyal customer of Sakanaya, I just wish they would improve their ramen and prepare it how they used to!!! Either way, I will still be coming back for the sushi at least once a week, Sakanaya is a necessity!"}
{"text":"With limited options in the area, this is probably best place for sushi. Sushi is alright, but the rolls.. Its always a disapointment. They used chogochujang on my spice salmon roll today. Tasted sad. Like wth. I mean if thats what chef thinks is best, sure, bit of a korean twist or what not but Im not getting any rolls from this place anymore. Especially when they costs extra $1-2 compare to chicagoland sushi places."}
{"text":"Sakanaya has the best sushi in Chambana, hands down.  I have been here many times and the sushi is always fresh, the rolls are delicious.   The only reason, I can't give them 5 stars is because of the restaurant itself.  It is very small and crowded.   You need to show up when they open a 5pm if you want to assure yourself of a table.  Best times to go are when the students are on break, but even then you may be waiting up to 30 minutes for a seat.  The wait staff is very attentive, and you can't go wrong with the white emperor roll, or the Uni.  They are also open late, went their once at 10:30 pm and got the last table available.  They have many other options besides sushi, people rave about their raman."}
{"text":"Great food always. However, very pricy for a student average lunch/dinner. It is good for a date night.   The sushi is good. If you want something fancy, order something that has flames (like \"playboy\"?). I personally like \"Gold Rush\" because it looks fancy (with a splash of gold sprinkles on top of the grilled eel).  Their \"katsu don\" is huge. And meat's thickness is in average. My friend says the sauce is good.  Their noodles are just average.   Their sashimi is a little pricey and sometimes they mistaken my order.  Their chirashi, a personal favorite. is good in size and variety.   Generally, recommend for their food if you want something a little extra for a good lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best sushi in town. When factoring in the price, I prefer Oishi, but it is hard to beat the atmosphere and flavor here. Across the board, the place really excels. My only complaint would be the price, but it is really misplaced, considering what you are getting for your money."}
{"text":"Expensive but good sushi, especially for Champaign.  The biggest problem I have with this place is their wait time (which usually deters me and ends up with me going to one of the other places very close by on the same street) and the service.  The servers usually make recommendations that are absolutely notably the most expensive item on the menu.  While it may be that the most expensive items are actually the best I some what doubt that to be the case every time."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Tried about 80% of the signature rolls on the menu and have loved them all. Their late night chicken wings are so well cooked and seasoned, they're definitely worth the wait! Lunch specials are a good deal and come with so much food you might have to take some home. I have nothing bad to say about this place. If you haven't tried it already then you definitely need to go!"}
{"text":"I came here on impulse for lunch last week. I've heard so many great things about it but with it being on campus, I was waiting for a slower night. I initially just wanted to get some ramen to go to satisfy my massive ramen craving I had. When I asked for some ramen to go, they informed me that they do do take out but that they can't do ramen to go. I decided to come in later and boy was I happy that I did! I ended up trying the Willis Tower appetizer which is this deconstructed sushi \"tower\" with tuna, roe, coleslaw, avocado, & rice. The fish was amazing and super fresh and I couldn't stop eating it. I also had a mojito which was certainly tasty but a little on the boozy side. I ended up ordering the miso ramen which was also pretty amazing. My only gripe was that I felt like the pork and egg were a little over cooked for my liking. Also, this place is teeny tiny. Total seating comes to about 30 people. So, I would not try to come here on a typical busier night. Calling ahead or having a back up plan might be the way to do it!  I can't wait to come back here for some sushi! This might be my new favorite sushi spot in town!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Quality of the fish is amazing for f47king central Illinois. Decor and ambiance is nice. Best part of Sakanaya was the service of the hostess. Incredibly helpful."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in Champaign Urbana, try the playgirl role you will NOT regret it!"}
{"text":"Had the late night menu here a couple weeks ago. The sushi itself was good, though the portions of tuna in the nigiri seemed less generous than comparable places in town like Yellowfin or Kamakura. The service was a little bit slow, and seating is limited: there was a 20 minute wait or so to get a table, even though it was past 10PM. The sake was cheap and plentiful enough to make the wait less of a big deal. We finished off our meal with the deep-fried chicken wings from their late-night menu. Quite good! To sneak in one final nitpick, though: the place tries very hard to make itself seem like a big-city sushi joint with its ambiance, and by that I mean music was blaring pretty loud through the speakers during our meal, making it hard to carry on quiet conversation."}
{"text":"Hands down the best RAMEN place in town! Sushi is good, so is the tempera. Never tried the sasimi here. Unagi don is just average in Champaign/Urbana area.   I thought I could find better ramen places in San Francisco bay area, since, you know, this is just in Champaign. But turns out, Sakanaya's ramen beats two of the ramen places I tried in SF, both of which has 4/5 stars on Yelp.   If you have the craving for ramen, definitely come here!"}
{"text":"I love Sakanaya! I get it so often. The wait is ridiculous, so I usually get take out. But the waitline app is really nice if you want to dine in. They're sushi and sashimi is the freshest on campus."}
{"text":"The hwaedupbap is really good :) highly recommended if craving for healthy and filling meal :) tonkatsu ramen is pretty good, especially it's broth! :) lastly the Willis tower was a bit greasy for me but my friend and sister enjoyed it ;;"}
{"text":"Yummy food and reasonable prices. Cute decoration and dishes. They had some special and different sushi rolls that are worth a try. I liked everything about this place and strongly recommend it if you want to have fresh and delicious sushi."}
{"text":"sakanaya has been the top in the uiuc however it's service became poor this semester. The waitress told me i am not allowed to sit in my seat because i ve leaved for a while to pick up a friend. But i have already ordered the food. Whats wrong. the food still have good performance. waitress please be smart."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. This is a great place to bring a date to. Only thing bad is  that it's kind of cramped because the space is small. As a result, you usually have to wait awhile to be seated (10-20min)."}
{"text":"The wings are so good! As always, the sashimi was amazing. I love the atmosphere here. I always enjoy my meal when I come here. You have to try the Alligator roll and the OMG! Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Went here on a first date and a first anniversary and both times we have been impressed with the quality of service and sushi. Love the ambiance, the sake is always refreshing, and the VIP roll is a personal fave. We will be back for another anniversary soon!"}
{"text":"Love their sushi, real real fresh, you can taste the sweet.  A little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi at good prices. Quality ramen but the chicken teriyaki was dry and needed more sauce to make it more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi and service. The space is a little small and tight but not awful once seated. The wait here is always long but if you reserve spot in line before coming it is manageable. Recommend the playgirl roll."}
{"text":"Sakanaya is my favorite place in CU to take my girlfriend on a date, it's small but the energy and atmosphere are always good. It's constantly packed because they've got the best sushi in the area. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys quality sushi."}
{"text":"Low FODMAP approved for certain sushi, nigiri, and rolls.  The I Love Tuna or I Love Salmon with no spicy sauce is the best bed. Definintely the best sushi in town."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly, and food is always great! I went for my birthday and took my mom for Mother's Day! It's always a treat and a good time! Playgirl and OMG are my favorite rolls and my mom loved the seaweed salad. The late night wings are also super delicious."}
{"text":"Long wait time, but totally worth it! This is the best place to eat by far in champaign Urbana-Champaign! It is literally the best sushi I have had. Anywhere. Ever."}
{"text":"Had an hour wait....  However,  the staff was fantastic and the food was great! The person who was seating even gave me money to put into my meter.  We told him we came from Chicago and as compensation  for waiting so long he gave us a kamikaze roll.  What a great staff,  wonderful service,  great food.  Absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The manager Jennifer contacted me on seeing my original review, she made an apology for my bad experience and promised to address the issue with that server at the restaurant. She is very sensible and helpful; I'm happy with the solution, and how the restaurant takes their customer service seriously. Let's hope it won't happen on other people in the future."}
{"text":"Before trying out Sakanya, I have had sushi thrice at some good restaurants. I'm not a big fan of sushi but still like to try different kind of sushi. I really wanted to try Sakanya after reading all the good reviews. I went here along with my husband at late dinner hours. Only 3 tables were occupied at that time. Our server seated us and handed over the menu. We were ready with our orders, but there was no one to take them. All the servers were chatting at the reception desk and not even one bothered to look at us. We waited for 15-20 minutes, before someone came to take our order. As I had checked in on Yelp, I got a complimentary miso soup deal, which I told the server. I ordered I love sushi, sea urchin(nigiri/sushi) and shumai. After 10 minutes shumai came, it was nice. Then 5 minutes later sushi came. I wondered where the soup went. So I asked a passing by server about the soup who called our server. I asked her about the complimentary soup to which she replied, \"can I see the deal?\". When I showed her that, she made me feel miser for using that deal. Anyways, soup came and it was good. Sushi was fine, but the roll which came in the platter did not taste good. Also, I did not like the sea urchin one. The food was fine, though I can't say the same about service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Champaign-Urbana! The wait time is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent ramen lunch. A bit pricey, but tasty."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi place in the Champaign Urbana area. Fish is fresh and orders are always on time."}
{"text":"My husband and myself went to this restaurant for \"date night\" yesterday, and had the best experience! The restaurant décor was beautiful and classy. The food was awesome! The service was great as well. This was the first time my husband had tried East Asian cuisine, and we were impressed by user friendly menu with well written descriptions. We both loved our eating experience...Thank you so much :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant Review So after 4 years of visiting this restaurant numerous times and even twice in the past week, it is sad to say that I am not visiting this restaurant again. I have not only spent a ton of money here, but i have referred numerous patrons to this restaurant. With the multiple times I have visited, sometimes we bring food for our 1 and 5 year old because they do not likely anything with sushi rice and the few times they had the ramen, my son drank an entire bottle of water at bedtime due to the salt content. We have switched and gotten McDonald (which I know has salt as well, depending on what you select) which they always enjoy while we had our meal. Today we had surprise guests from out of town and we came for a second time this week for a meal. The general manager of the restaurant came over and began to lecture me for 10 minutes/arguing about the food for the two kids. Mind you there is 5 paying adults at the tables and the two kids. I explain how I had numerous times come to the restaurant and you can even seen on my facebook pictures were we brought our own food in. The general manager basically repeated over and over that the rules are no outside food (MIND YOU this is not written anywhere) even if it is for kids/infants, that he knows we are regulars and he brought over free miso soup which no one drank (i didn't ask for this nor does it offset what you put me through), and then he proceeded to stand over me while I tried to pull up my facebook pictures showing we had brought in food from the outside for our kids numerous times we have come in. I can understand if you come over and state in the future the kids can't have there own meals and you can decide if you want to visit our establishment, but to stand there lecturing for 10 minutes in front of my family, guests, and other customers is just absurd. I spoke with the owner Jin as well and indicated I would have to put this information up because it would be fair for families to understand whether they are family friendly in terms of dietary issues. Overall I have never been so displeased and heartbroken as this was my favorite restaurant they have given so much word of mouth campaign to coworkers, friends, and neighbors. With that I will have to close this culinary chapter because a meal should be fun, not something that irritates you beyond belief."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Best in town, no doubt. The crunch munch is my favorite. Great service and atmosphere. Gets extremely busy on weekends so you might have to wait a bit to be seated, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am often in the Champaign area because I have a sister who attends college there and she took me to this place to have the lunch special.  It was a good portion of food and reasonably priced. For the lunch special we got the miso soup and 2 rolls which was the perfect amount of food for lunch!   Also loved the inside of this place- it was super cute!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, my sashimi was thick cut & very fresh. I had the Sake Don and was impressed with the salmon quality. There was a lot of rice, definitely enough food. The vegetables were good although the carrots were too pickled for my personal taste. Green tea was pre-brewed (not served in individual pot but in a large mug which I liked a lot compared to the usual tea pot/ tiny mug experience.) the ambiance was modern but welcoming. Overall a pleasing fusion of modern decor, quality sushi and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant on campus. Operated by Miga, a very good Asian fusion restaurant in town. Atmosphere is very cool, sushi is fresh and inventive. We tried the Willis Tower sushi appetizer - beautiful and delicious.  Everything I have had there has been very good - noodle dishes, sushi, etc."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews and did not disappoint. Willis tower is interesting, nice presentation and a great mix of flavors and textures, a must try! The rolls are also very good. Sashimi is fresh , will visit again!"}
{"text":"1. This is a sweet lookin' spot: There's wood everywhere, and it's got a nice chill atmosphere and proper seating. Aesthetically speaking, it's above and beyond most of the sushi joints we have in this town.  2. The ramen, oh god, the ramen: I didn't personally order any, but I kept stealing bites of my friends and wow, it was so tasty.  3. The sushi was alllllllll amazing! My friends and I all ordered a few different rolls so we could sample them all and I still couldn't pick a favorite because everything was so freakin good.  If this place weren't on campus, I would be there often but it just gets a bit busy with students sometimes. Even then, still totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem that you might never expect in Champaign, IL. The freshness of the sushi and sashimi is unparalleled and the quality of fish is amazing. Gio, the manager, is a superstar and succeeds in running a tight ship with superb food! It's relatively small, so make sure to get a reservation if it's a busy weekend. Thanks for the fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times for lunch; each time ordering something different. The first time was ramen, the second was a different dish (name is escaping me) and the most recent was a sushi combo for lunch. The food was absolutely delicious - the sushi tasted fresh (reminded me of sushi I ate in Hawaii). Tables around us were ordering rolls and they were creatively displayed. If i could give a half star I would rate them as 4.5; on my most recent visit the waitress did not bother to check in on us after serving our food. The service was excellent my previous visits so I wasn't sure what was going on this time."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of sushi and I got the opportunity to try Sakanaya for the first time yesterday for lunch. Everything I had was very flavorful and well presented. The spicy tuna roll was unlikely other sushi restaurants around. They actually use whole slices of tuna, toss it in the spicy sauce and roll it as opposed to other locations. The decor was great and very upscale. I would definitely recommend the \"It's Seoul good\" roll. I will definitely be back, probably tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short. The sushi at Sakanaya was terrific. Specifically, the Sakanaya, the Alligator, and the Crunch Munch rolls were all amazing.   It is understandably pricy so not your average college fare.   Quickie review: best sushi on campus. Come here if you're willing to spend 25-35 dollars on food."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great. It's a little small, but we were still seated quickly each of the times we've eaten there. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took almost 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to our table the last time we were there (although she did a good job after that), and the cups were dirty (but she promptly changed them)."}
{"text":"I liked it here and it's a great addition to Green St.  It is a bit cramped for space and that also makes it kind of loud since it's almost entirely college kids.  We had to wait 15-20min to be seated but we were notified of the wait as soon as we walked in (and it was an accurate estimate).  I wasn't terribly impressed with the more expensive rolls, not compared to other sushi I've had.  Since their most expensive roll was $18 it's still pretty darn cheap.    If I were in the area I wouldn't hesitate to pop in for a few classic rolls, which are around $6.  With access to a car, however, I'd prefer to head to Kofusion - much better atmosphere and I think the sushi is better too (though it'll cost more).  ....oh I miss when Miko was a thing."}
{"text":"Oh, dear Sakanaya. One of the better Japanese restaurants available in the CU. I've been here several times from its grand opening to the present.  The sushi is the freshest I've had in this little town. They've stayed true to bits and pieces of Asian recipes, however they're still greatly modified to suit the American taste (aka pile the spicy mayo!). The soup base seems to be the same across the board, either pork or miso.   Presentation of food is beautiful. Chicken wing appetizers are crispy and juicy. However, items are overpriced and the service is a hit or miss. The only reason I eat ramen here is to satisfy my craving and the lack of ramen shops in the CU. All in all, give it a shot if you've never tried to see what the hype's been about."}
