{"text":"A good variety of food all over the world. Seating area is clean. You can also enjoy the sunshine through the glass roof. But if it's during rush hours, the lineup is usually very long for some popular restaurants. Price is normal compare to most food court."}
{"text":"I went there on the opening day.  I was looking for the old food-court by HR, but it was closed. (I hadn't been there for a while.)  So I went up to Dine on 3, and it was a very innovative how they created that space up there.  

A DJ in all-white outfit was blasting music to celebrate their grand-opening.  It was a bit too loud for my taste.  I would've been okay for a store opening, but not for a place where people want to eat.

The variety of selection was pretty good and there was plenty of seating for different size of groups.  It was somewhat divided into different spaces, but it looks good.

I had teriyaki and it was good.  I will have to try their more 'unique' offerings next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Dine on 3.

First of all, I think the name is a little ridiculous. I agree that the new food court is more suited to Yorkdale's clientele, but really?

Anyways, that being said, the new additions that I can remember are:
+Esspressemate Illy
+A pizzeria (sit down)
+ A gelato place
+ Amara? (Amaya?) Indian
+ Chipotle
+ Glowpress (grilled cheese, etc)
+ Shanghai 360 (Asian)
+ Big Smoke Burger
+ Su & Shi (Spring Rolls)

The food court is more expensive than it was originally (big surprise) and is VERY similar to the Eaton Centre;s Urban Eatery.

I was impressed with Big Smoke Burger (yummmm) and Shanghai 360 (both are also at Eaton Centre). They are good, but at the end of the day they are still food court food! I have yet to try Su & Shi. I also recommend Illy for sitting down.

I am impressed with the table service, ability to make reservations on the app, and the OUTDOOR PATIO! :) There also seems to be a lot more seating.

They did class the place up, but I will say I miss the addition of Cultures- those trying to eat healthy food don't have as quick of an option!

Worth a visit + better than the poor service at Pickel Barrel Yorkdale."}
{"text":"With Yorkdale's new and improved underground parking lot, I find myself frequenting this mall more often! 

Their new and improved food court is also pretty impressive. Come on, you could actually RESERVE a table at this food court. Just talk to the food court concierge when you come up those escalators. This way, you'll never be stuck holding a tray, frantically finding for a spot to sit in. 

The new decor is spacious and modern. The clean up station is also much more efficient than the old throw-it-away yourself bins. The variety of fast food restaurants are pretty standard: Chipotle, Manchu Wok, New York Fries, Shanghai 360...etc. 

Tip: Reserve a table, and shop till you're ready to eat!"}
{"text":"Not much more I can say about this food court that hasn't been said already. I know reviewing a food court and not the whole mall is kinda weird right? not when the dodo court itself is akin to a fine dining restaurant nor at least a swanky ultra modern one! 

The fixtures and decor are excellent and the standard by which everyday vendors need to up their aesthetic game make vendors like Made In Japan look like high end shi-shi restaurants. 

The selection here is also way better than most food courts. It ranges from food court standards to more upscale joints that will tickle your tastebuds. 

The final item of note is the level of service dine on 3 provides. Clean up staff is continually tidying up your table as soon as you finish like a restaurant. Also there are cleaning stations and real utensils for use throughout. 

Definitely a great place to stop when you get a hankering for something while shopping."}
{"text":"Easily wins best food court in a mall in the GTA. Just a note, they moved the location of the food. There is an escalator the highway 401 side of the mall. Unlike most other boring food courts, this place has many non-standard items. Specifically,

- A sit down pizzeria, menu looked good and they use a wood burning stove 
- Shanghai 360 - soups and dumplings
- A yummy Gelato place (same as Vaughn Mills)
- Chipotle - my fav burrito place
- A coffee place - (Called lilly I think)
-  Amaya Indian food (separate seating)
-  Glow - yummy grill cheese, even with lobster
- A sushi and noodle house run by Spring Rolls
- Smoke house Burger 

Than they had the common food court standards like KFC, Thai Express, New York fries, A&W and Teriyaki. Very nice and they give you real dishes and cutlery. I was there on a Monday and it was busy so I expect this place would be a zoo on the weekend. 

Highly recommended - not your standard boring food court. Designers of the new Markville mall food court should have visited Dine on 3 for some inspiration."}
{"text":"There are a lot of things I like about this place. I like that they still have A&W and KFC. I also like that sushi spot. I REALLY like that they have all reusable cutlery, bowls, plates, and cups.I just wish they found a way to make it bigger since it's always SO CRAMMED.

Also, they took away the Arby's, which is the Hubster's first and other love."}
{"text":"Located on the upper level of Yorkdale Mall, there is a pretty good selection of restaurants here. My personal favourites are shanghai 360, Mi, Thai Express, Subway, and KFC. Place is relatively clean too with workers who consistently separate food trays and clean tables. Customers should maintain the cleanliness too."}
{"text":"Its a food court....I don't know what to say about it....ok, this is what I have to say about it....

ITS A FOOD COURT! many stalls. crappy food, cheap food, but they try to make it high-end and environmentally friendly with cutlery instead of foam plates and plastic cutlery. No Service, Food Court Environment, and the same old food you see everywhere....KFC...Thai Express....Subway....and some other chains. 

There really is nothing to write about but as everyone wanted to post a review, here is mine."}
{"text":"Came here today for a shopping trip. I haven't been to Yorkdale since the renovations. The food court itself has a really good variety of food choices. We decided to try the food at Chipotle. There was a massive queue for food here. I was thinking because the food must be so delicious but in reality the service here was just too slow. There seemed to be a lot of servers but only 1 person was making our orders. They should work like Subway, and have 3/4 persons making your order. Here it's 1 person making your whole order along the line. Then 1 person packing. Much too slow. We got food from Shanghai 360 and Villa Medina too. 
The other bad point about here is the lack of seating. I cannot image trying to find a spot at the weekends. Today was bad enough and we were eating at around 2pm. I thought the seating was bad Fairview but it's even worse here. 
Nice variety of food available here but way too little seating."}
{"text":"Wow, Yorkdale did good. 

The new food court at Yorkdale is now called Dine on 3. Who knows what used to be up here, but now (near the Banana Republic and MAC) you'll find yourself in a ultra modern, Urban Eatery like oasis of fast food and restaurants. 

Yes, they've added two new restaurants - a Pizzeria and a ramen place. I checked out the menu for ramen, and it's about $8-10. Both have sit down and waiter service. Up here is also Big Smoke Burger, Thai Express, Paloma Gelato, Glow-Express and the usually, but updated facade of KfC, A&W, Jimmy the Greek, Teriyaki Experience etc. There's also an espresso bar yet to be opened that serves Illy Coffee with a loungey area on the 2nd floor. 

The ceilings were a bit low, but the place is HUGE. And there is a lounge space and patio to the back of the room. There's not much to look at, but it's nice to have a spot outside. But it's small. 

We didn't eat here, but I also found out that there are purse hooks under each table. Sweet!

I think this is a really smart move, as Yorkdale expands with higher end stores etc, this space, I can't wait to eat here, or spend more time in the mall, which I guess is their objective. 

Today was their grand opening and they had a live DJ!  Worth taking a visit. I wonder what they will do with the old space. I bet Holts will take over."}
{"text":"This is Urban Eatery done properly.  While Markville and Square One have tried to replicate it, they don't have enough space to do it.  

a) They still have the basic staples - A&W and KFC. 
b) There is a real cafe such as Esparamente illy (I have no idea how to spell it).  
c) There is also a proper SU & Shi and Famoso Eatery.
d) They use real cutlery and are environmentally friendly.  

While it's a food court, you don't feel totally ashamed and guilty eating here.  

My only pet peeve is that the washrooms near the escalator are confusing as it becomes a bit of a maze trying to get out with all the doors."}
{"text":"They do a fantastic job for Indian fast food

I am biased as I have been an Amaya fan from day one

It's a fantastic but pricey meal and no wonder when rent is $20k a month"}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday to meet a few friends for lunch.  A sales guy in Armani Xchange recommended going to Dine on 3, instead of pickle barrel or moxies.  hmmm...

Well, it's a pretty fancy food court.  But it's still a food court.  It was really really well lit.  There were a lot of food options.  Being lazy, I had sushi, because it was closest to the entrance, and quite frankly.  I was starving.  The quality of sushi I had was ok.  But it is \"sushi to go\"....

My friends ordered grilled cheese sandwiches from glow press or glow-express (whatever that is called).  It was ok."}
{"text":"In the tradition of the Eaton Centre's new foodcourt. For such a large mall, there is not a lot of table space. The not really an improvement on the old second floor foodcourt that was near Holts. I actually quite liked the old food court (done up in a kind Mediterranean tile theme). My favorite was the seats that ringed the ceiling dome, giving you the \"dome voice illusion\" (http://www.pa.uky.edu/sciworks/qother.htm#dome). Anyone sitting on the opposite side of the dome their conversation would be amplified and you'd hear it as if the people were right behind you. Freaky cool.

The fireplace and seating around the fireplace are nice touches. Women might appreciate the purse hooks. There's a very large seating area outside the washrooms, great to plunk yourself down while your GF, typically, takes more time. Not sure about the second floor landing space. It's empty. Given the lack of table space, you wonder why they didn't make more use of this."}
{"text":"This is first time I get here after their renovation. Their foodcourt look fancy itself and fit-able with the upscale mall. Nothing to complain about the food in here. 
They having sitting area with fireplace and it's quiet so it's good for study."}
{"text":"Was there today with my Fiancée, I had New York fries. I got the works poutine.  While good, for a fries and poutine place it was okay. I would have preferred to have gone to a Smokes. For $7 for a regular size I'd call it a snack size, Def finally not meal worthy. The topping were great and lots of them A++ in that. In general, I would go back but I would not go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"This food court tries to incorporate restaurant dining into the fast food experience. In fact, the results yield much improved eating experience. You can eat at this food court without getting that typical grimey/dirty feeling you get when shoveling down a heap of sweet and sour chicken balls on an overcrowded plastic bench table.

They do a good job with keeping everything clean and the space itself is very open with decor that actually adds some ambiance to the whole experience. They also add in some higher class chain restaurants such as Spring Rolls, Glow, and Amaya for some better quality options? Overall, don't expect the food to magically improve in taste, but the big shiny new space is an undeniable step up."}
{"text":"Great reno. I remember the old yorkdale food court being this little crappy eaterie with limited options and now its been renovated to a chic and modern dining area. From fast food franchises like Chipotle, Big Smoke, Glow to restaurants like Famoso and Moxies, the food variety is impeccable. 

Dining area can get quite congested and seats are sometimes hard to find... so are garbage cans, oddly enough."}
{"text":"I stayed at a hotel nearby so I pretty much went to Yorkdale for lunch almost every single day.  I felt that the food court was very spacious, clean, and designed very well but it was still quite hard to find seats sometimes.  

I enjoyed the Glow Press grilled cheese eatery quite a lot, while other vendors such as Big Smoke Burger and Jimmy the Greek disappointed me.  In general, I found that the prices in the food court were comparable to many of the restaurants in Toronto so I found the value to be quite low, but I guess the food court is situated in one of the most expensive malls in North America so I shouldn't complain!"}
{"text":"I will review the food court on the basis of the food court itself, not the individual restaurants.

Dine on 3 continues the Cadillac Fairview trend of an open-concept design and increased environmental sustainability by limiting on waste. Out of the three I've been to (Urban Eatery, Dine on 3, and Express Eatery), I would put Dine on 3 around the same level as the Urban Eatery.

There is a respectable selection of eateries here; definitely a lot more than the old food court (which was probably one of the most depressing food courts for a mall its size). You have your typical fast food chains such as A&W, KFC, Jimmy the Greek, Manchu Wok, Subway, Thai Express, and Teriyaki, but also some unique places like Big Smoke Burger, Espressamente Illy, Famoso, Glow Press, and SU&SHI.

Again I won't rate the individual eateries in this review. That will come if I try out the different eateries in this food court. It's miles better than the old food court for sure, but it didn't exactly \"wow\" me."}
{"text":"With the exit of Glow Press there is one less gluten free option. Don't even bother asking MII Sandwich Co. that took over Glow Press' spot if they have gluten free bread for their sandwiches. That concept is a foreign one to their staff."}
{"text":"Pretty solid food court - they have the standard fare. There's an Indian place, a Chipotle, a Thai Island, etc etc. Fairly clean, with the staff emptying out the trash and cleaning out the trays regularly. 

There's a small outdoor seating area if you want to eat outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Very fancy foodcourt I must say.   I'm interested in that espresso bar - I'll have to revisit.  I went to Glow and had their Lobster and Spinach Mac n Cheese (picture attached).  You get a good portion for what you pay for, I ended up needing a to go container. 
Glow basically has \"make your own grilled cheeses\"... with 2 side portions.  They were quite busy and the sides looks delicious too.

Other than that it's your typical food court.  Staff are quick at cleaning up which is nice and tables are always clean."}
{"text":"I liked this place when it first opened up.  Now, it feels like it's busting at the seams...figuratively speaking.  Ceiling also feels very low, making the place feel even more congested.  A newer food court, but still not enough space or tables.

Try to avoid going there during peak dining times.  Otherwise, you'll feel like a nerd trying to locate a table during lunch time.  Quite a few tables were being hoarded by inconsiderate people who were just on their phones, alone, sitting at a table of 4 with 3 of the chairs EMPTY.  Were they waiting for people?  Maybe or maybe not.

If you're with your family, in a couple, or a larger group, it may even be worth it just to go to a restaurant in the mall as it was too crazy to just locate a table.

When you're not even done eating, people are circling your table, asking if you're done...even while you are on the phone!

Atmosphere was anything but relaxing or chill.  Too noisy, hectic, and full of rude people."}
{"text":"Food is over priced. For average food. For such a high scale mall the food court could be better"}
{"text":"Now that I work up in the boonies (Allen Rd. & Wilson) - Yorkdale is now my closest to work food option (and even then I have to take the subway one stop south). 

I miss the old foodcourt. It was roomier and close to the subway entrance. This new food court is difficult to find and 10 minutes into the mall.

There is a full table service - dine in Spring rolls in the food court, as well as a trendy looking large coffee shop.

I had the \"Butter Chicken Poutine\" at the Indian place \"Amaya\". The fries were bland. There was hardly any cheese.

Their tamarind lassi was refreshing yet hearty and I would go back just for the lassi."}
{"text":"Oh you fancy huh?

I came to york dale after school for dinner and to try chipotle for the first time. This food court is very posh I understand why square one is trying to replicate it. No matter where you eat you feel like your eating at a restaurant because you are provided with real cutlery as opposed to plastic. It's super clean and the have staff waiting by the garbage to collects your trays and anything you want to discard. 

Now onto chipotle! I needed to find out what the fuss is about. I had a chicken burrito with all the fixings. It honestly couldn't hold together so I poured it all into a bowl. I must admit the flavours were good and they were generous with the serving. They actually have the best chicken Amongst all the tex mex chains. However, burrito bits still has them beat because they are cheaper, fresher, wrapped to perfection, they have more protein options and the hot sauce is actually hot. Burrito boys grills they're burritos making them have a crispy layer that hold all the ingredients in securely. All the other chains need to follow!  
But it was still good just not great."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great !
Went to Manchu Wok though and that was a mistake for sure. Bad enough they charge you $1 extra to add shrimp as part of your order but then when you goto pay there's a big (for me anyway) gotcha. Try asking for Any condiments and you'll see that THEY CHARGE FOR EVERYTHING !!!
Soy sauce ? $.05 per packet. Hot sauce ? Ditto. 
What a joke !!!!!
DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY !!!!"}
{"text":"Dine on 3! If more food courts are set up this way, I would have dine in at food courts a lot more.

Love the mix of fast food and sit down restaurants. 

Definitely a to go place for lunch, snack and dinner if you are shopping at Yorkdale Mall. I love Esspressemate Illy!!!!!!!!

But I won't make a special trip just to eat there as the parking can be just ridiculous even on a weekday afternoon............ Stay Stay faraway over the weekend!"}
