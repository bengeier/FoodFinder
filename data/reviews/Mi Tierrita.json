{"text":"Greatest alambres taco (grilled pork with bits of bacon) in the area along with amazing chorizo tacos. Tortillas for the tacos are hand made to order. Don't miss out on the yuca con chicharron. Tender juicy bits of pork heaven.
It would benefit to know español or have a translator app handy. Either way the menu is en ingles and has pictures.  The food is amazing."}

This is a great Salvadorian restaurant. My favorite things to get are yuca con chicharrón, pupusas revueltas, and tacos al pastor. The chicharrón here isn't like pork cracklings, it's tender and moist although I'm not sure how they prepare it. The fried yuca is good although it could be cut thinner, but that's just my preference. Pupusas for anyone who isn't familiar are similar to a quesadilla, but the meat (revuelta would be pork) is a finer consistency and the edges are sealed. They make their own corn tortillas, so the tacos as always great. It would help to know some Spanish, but it's definitely not necessary.  

Also Friday is dollar pupusa day and Sunday is dollar taco day!"}
{"text":"Yum. Must try the yucca con chicharrones. All tortillas are made in house and I think the tacos alambres are out of this world with bits of bacon with the marinated pork. So hidden I bet it will take you a trip and a half to find this location. Best secret in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yummy \"no frills\" food for fast and cheap! We got chicken enchiladas and a pastor burrito. Helps to know a little Spanish - and make sure to look at their handheld menu rather than the wall menu."}
