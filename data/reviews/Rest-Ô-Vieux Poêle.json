{"text":"Awesome home-made everything.  The breakfasts are very nice, not swimming in grease, they have lovely daily specials for a very good price!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a lunch stop after crossing the border. Food was excellent.  Great poutine and croissants.  Local place and very friendly."}
{"text":"Un petit Resto qui a l'air de rien mais qui a une qualité de service exceptionnelle! La serveuse du soir connaît les habitudes de sa clientèle. Dès la rentrée elle nous demande si on veut la même chose que d'habitude...

Voici les points forts: frites maisons qui sont très bonnes, un poulet rôti qui est excellent... Un Philly cheesesteak qui est très bon aussi et qui est unique à cet endroit. Un  choix de desserts tout à fait charmants."}
{"text":"Decent food but don't expect anything fancy. Watch out for their strange payment options...they got the best of us and made a very nice profit on us tourists. We had the house salad (just ice burg lettuce and a few toppings), poutine, and a small pizza. When it was time to pay, they said they only take cash or debit due to high credit card fees. Turns out, they only take CANADIAN debit cards, so that left the cash option for us. We didn't have enough CA dollars, but she agreed only to take US dollars at a 1:1 (current exchange rate was actually about 1 US to 1.20 CA). So we gave her $40 us to pay for a $29 CA meal, got back $10 CA... So the meal cost us quite a bit more and we were left with Canadian dollars that we will never use as we were headed back to the US. We even offered to pay the credit card fee above the meal price, but she declined....they are clearly using some deceptive money practices there. Put a bit of a sour note on our visit to this local restaurant."}
