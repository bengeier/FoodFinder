{"text":"Food was great - ordered chicken lollipop to start.  Mains - butter chicken, lamb curry and palak paneer with rice and naan bread.  Wait staff were very attentive.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love it here! Flavor and it just don't stop!
As for the owner, Joyson? Fantastic guy who really goes that extra mile to make sure patrons enjoy their experience.
 
Now... time for a song...

When there's a zombie at your feet,
And he wants something quick to eat,
And his homeland is Bangladesh
And all he wants is your FLESH!!!
Yakety, yak
Don't talk back..."}
{"text":"Best pakoras EVER. Made to order....so crispy and fresh.
Menu items from southern & northern India with Hakka dishes as well.
Butter chicken is a tad spicy, but makes it the best in Toronto. So tender and nice large pieces.
The calm atmosphere and super friendly staff make this place a keeper. Kids meal available as well, and we always have lots for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Having been here multiple times, here is a sample of some of the dishes ordered: butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, lamb curry, mix vegetable alfreezi, butter and garlic naan, and a spicy shrimp appetizer who's name I can't remember.
As the restaurant covers both hakka and indian cuisine, the menu is quite large and can be intimidating. Ask your waiter if you have any questions, they're extremely knowledgable.
The food was all delicious. The butter chicken is smooth and refreshing, with just a hint of spice to give it some flavour. The vindaloo, a Goan dish most often the hottest dish in any indian restaurant, is surprisingly not that spicy here, but still has that distinctive flavour that peaks your interest. Naan is always delicious, however I did find the jalfreezi a tad sweet on one visit. It did make for a good contrast to all the spicy dishes I tend to order."}
{"text":"Well, I can't think of a reason not to like this place.  When you first walk in you get that authentic Indian feel.  This place is massive for an Indian restaurant.  The people or honestly extremely friendly, humble, and very helpful when ordering your food.  

On first impressions I was very impressed so far.  I usually go for the lunch specials at this restaurant for my lunch break.  Reason being you get a main dish, rice, salad, and a huge delicious homemade naan bread, all this for 8.95! I think this is a good deal for lunch compared to your fast food joints.  I've tried just about all of the lunch specials and they're all very good, especially the chicken sukka.  I recommend it all.  

All in all this place is very very good, one of the best places for Indian food in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Great Indian Restaurant in Mississauga. Ordered Bainggan Bartha and Butter Chicken. Delicious. The restaurant could use a renovation as the play is old and very dim."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and we ordered a mix of a la carte as well as off their prix fixe lunch menu for ~$13.  Fixed lunch included BOTH soup of the day + salad (a palm-full of julienned veggies) + entr√©e + naan + rice + soft drink.

All the sides themselves was more than enough food for me, so decent value.  The problem?  I didn't really like my main, Madurai Chicken Masala, a coconut curry which just tasted like something my mom c/would make.

I also sampled other dishes at the table:  Chilli Paneer, Chilli Chicken, & Butter Chicken, and I thought that the best item was the Butter Chicken.  Chilli Chicken/Paneer were actually spicy.

Service was very polite.  Atmosphere is a dim, covered in wood, and a bit strange as it looks like the inside of a boat as a former Wharf-themed restaurant.

Would not be opposed to visit again, but my experience was just OK."}
{"text":"Food and service deteriorated this time round, and on a week night at 7 pm, they were already out of noodles!"}
{"text":"Trying to find some good ethnic food in Mississauga, I came here with two friends for dinner.  Prices are quite inexpensive, food is plentiful and delicious.  We ordered naan, an eggplant dish, Manchurian chowmein, a chicken dish, mango lassis, and some chilli paneer.  All were almost completely consumed except the eggplant dish (slightly too much mango pickle in the sauce that also made it look somewhat unappetizing.)

Also - love the decor, which I think belonged to what was previously a seafood restaurant.  Maybe they could pass it off as \"coastal Indian/Chinese food\"?  Lastly, the music selection is super amazing too - one example- Gangnam Style instrumental with someone singing in Hindi on top.  YES!!!

Lastly, I think the proprietors also have a good sense of hustle - in their menus they touted quite a number of loyalty programs.  

I will be returning next time I feel like some Hakka food."}
