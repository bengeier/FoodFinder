{"text":"This pizza place is by far the worst in Vegas. Customer service is a joke. They do not fix problems period. Very low quality food. Do yourself a favor and do not order from Sorrento's. EVEN IF ITS LATE NITE and all the good places are closed!!! Its that bad, and they don't care. They did not fix my problem, nor will they yours, and trust me there will be problems. Just awful.....they dont deserve even one star"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The order was wrong. We asked for white sauce on the pizza since my boyfriend and I have hard time to digest tomato sauce and we actually got tomato sauce instead of the white one. Also, the cheese is almost absent and tastes absolutely nothing. The crust remind me a piece of cardboard box. Really not worth the price and the delivery fees. So I suggest you to avoid the pizza from here.

UPDATE 10/31/2015: The chicken wings are as bad as the pizza, no flavor. My boyfriend asked for mild spicy and he got plain wings. Apparently this place was good a few years ago, we wonder what's happened. Very disappointing, we won't let them a chance anymore."}
{"text":"Had the Halal pepperoni pizza and cheese pizza, both excellent, great taste. Owners were extremely pleasant folks."}
{"text":"We love this place. Delicious pizza, and halal too, so we enjoyed it immensely and the service. Always good service, very nice people. I would highly recommend this place for good food, especially those who eat halal/kosher/no swine...totally an added bonus!"}
{"text":"The food, the customer service, and the expectation for the accuracy of the order placed have always been spot on perfect. Believe me when I say the food is delicious, because it is. #FiveStars!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from them twice, late night about 11pm. It took over 2 hours. My food was hard and cold when I got it and they forgot MY drinks both times!!! They ended up getting part of my order wrong, had to wait another hour for the rest of my order to come back (the soda and food) and I didn't open my door when they came back.

 PLEASE make sure you ask about the PRICES!!! They will OVER CHARGE you. They charge me $4 for 1 liter of soda, $4 for a slice of cake, $12 for a hard cold medium pepperoni pizza and 6 for something i
Never even got.
 
The manager thought it was funny he had over charged me, tried to be ass over the phone, saying \" I'll take care of you next time\" ...  But I will Never ordering from them again!!!!"}
{"text":"The old owners were friendly, and they made good food. The people who own it now are running the resturaunt down the drain. Not only do they not allow customers to use the restroom anymore, but the burgers are raw, the chicken is rubber, and the pizza is somehow oily and dry. I won't be returning. Now I have to go cook this raw burger."}
{"text":"Food was alright, I ordered online to have it delivered and It took more than 3 hours for food to arrive at my doorstep. The food was a little cold and soggy for the time duration and lady on the phone was a bit rude. Also food is a little expensive and 12$ for delivery wasn't worth it. Overall, took FOREVER, decent food, poor costumer service, and a bit over priced, especially delivery. Had a bad first impression on the place. Didn't even provide napkins or an apology for late soggy food. Downloaded app just to write a bad review, that's how disappointed I was."}
{"text":"I will never, ever order from here again.

I picked this place based on the Yelp reviews through EAT24.  I ordered the large pizza with fingers, an appetizer sampler, and fries.  I always complete my online purchases through Google Wallet and do so with this.  Order submitted at 8:11pm, 45 minute delivery time.

I get a call at 8:40pm from a guy saying he needs my credit card number, I explain I already paid through Google Wallet when persists that he still needs my number.  I give him the number and again state I've already paid when he says ok, I just needed the number, they should have the food out in 40 minutes.  40 minutes?  But I ordered half an hour ago?!  Oh you did?  Food is almost done the driver will be out soon.

I contact EAT24 because the card thing doesn't sit well with me.  After 20 minutes of negotiating with this place they realize I was being charged AGAIN even after I made sure and said I already paid.  The lady at EAT24 tells me they are refunding me and just confirmed it will be another 45 minutes.

Ten minutes later, I get another call this time telling me they're out of fingers but instead of five fingers they'll give me 12 wings for the inconvenience.  Here's the thing, the deal comes with either five fingers or 12 wings, they're not doing any favors.  When I start to say I don't even want this anymore because of the extreme lateness, being double charged, and them not having fingers, she says she'll throw in a two liter for the inconvenience.  Whatever.

Food gets here: pizza is cold, chicken is ridiculously dry, appetizers are burnt (all except for the mushrooms which I can't eat).  The only thing that tastes good, not just barely edible, are the fries.  I waited two hours for some of the worst delivery in my life.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"The gentleman was extremely nice & friendly. He made you feel like you were family.
The pizza was wicked good. We are from Boston and this is very close to our pizza. They are not skimpy on the toppings.
The prices are decent too.
The steak philly was good but small.
Definitely try it, you will love it!!"}
{"text":"I like the pizza ands the owner is really nice. I can tell he puts a lot of pride into his work. Tends to be a little overly greasy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It says it's halal, and personally i respect when someone is upfront with their beliefs and true to themselves."}
{"text":"Being pregnant, I had a craving for pizza and chicken fingers. The prices are crazy. For delivery it was almost $35 just for a large one topping pizza and chicken fingers. I considered it a treat for myself so I paid it over the phone with my credit card. The lady taking my order was nice, and she told me the order would be there in 20 minutes or less. My apartment building is literally across the street, a two minute walk. And hour and ten minutes later the delivery driver said he couldn't find our building number when we saw him pull into the gate and get right out of his vehicle. The food was warm but not hot by any means and my chicken fingers were so soggy I couldn't even eat them! The first time I tried this place it was great. Now, I doubt I will ever go back again."}
{"text":"I was worried at first because of the bad reviews, but after reading through them and being able to tell which reviews are from one occasion written by different people I was no longer worried.  I have had the pizza from Sorrento's on three separate occasions and I will be going back for more.  I ordered the 4 cheese with marinara sauce and the meat lovers pizza each time.  I also ordered to go each time.  This is a halal restaurant which is great.  We waited a bit for the pizza to be done because we saw them hand make the pizza so I didn't mind waiting (20 minutes).  The dough was delicious and soft, and the cheese was so tasty.  Fresh tasting.  Don't judge the pizza by the location or the characters near  by.  It seems to be ran by a really nice family."}
{"text":"Not only was the food expensive the chicken wing weren't spicy and my sister called it \"pussy nuggets\" cause they were also small and they were hard which made it worse. And don't get me started on the pizza. . . The pizza was grease as shit that's what my sister also said but she isn't wrong cause the pizza was so grease that the grease went through the cardboard box. So don't get food from here you should order pizza Hut it's better."}
{"text":"They told me 45 minutes to a hour They took 2 hrs and food was ok. Nothing special. I would not eat there again"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant ......must try for people visiting or staying here....The food is ultimate ... specially the pizza and wings.....The people serving are very nice and courteous .it takes time though but it's worth the wait......The food is clean as it is Halal.should try it you will not regret......"}
{"text":"The pizza was nice and tasty my kids enjoyed very much The gentleman who took our order was super friendly"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Took two hours and food was cold and ordered was not complete. Skip these guys and look for someone else. Bad customer service to top it off."}
{"text":"order was 40 minutes late , cold , fries were  soggy and undercooked  and didn't really taste  like garlic at all , pizza was ok would not spend  money here again honestly"}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst pizza I've ever seen. This was my first time ordering and I had a traditional pepperoni pizza delivered with literally 5 pieces of pepperoni on the entire pie. Hardly any sauce at all either, it was mostly just soggy crust. When I called to complain they told me that everybody loves their food and they refused any refund while cursing at me until I hung up. Stay far away from this pit."}
{"text":"Called in for a Hawaiian pizza with white sauce. Guy over the phone wasn't too friendly. He said it'll be ready in 25 minutes. My husband went to pick it up and man over the counter said there was nothing about my order. He said maybe it was another guy who took the order. Also, he told my husband they ran out of Alfredo sauce and had to run out to get more. This was not relayed to me at all over the phone. So he said we had to wait another 15 mins for the sauce and another 10-15 mins for the pizza to cook. That's another half hour or so! So screw it. My husband just left. Horrible horrible customer service! There was no apology, nothing! So sad coz their pizza isn't too bad actually."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since I first started ordering from them a few months ago. There were multiple problems with my most recent order. They called twice to verify info they should've already had like my address. They took at least 1.5 hours to deliver my order. One of the items was wrong as well."}
{"text":"It's a good day when sorrento pepperoni pizza is for dinner . Specially now that the management changed . AWESOME and very tasty pizza"}
{"text":"I lived in NJ all of my life and spoiled to NJ/NYC pizza. I stopped into Sorrento's after work about 9:15. Dieon made probably the best pizza I've  eaten since moving to Las Vegas in November 2016. The order was to-go,  it took a little time but the slices were the best...oozing with cheese, flavorful sauce and crispy crust. He put the slices in a pizza slice box, with napkins, even two small containers of grated parmesan cheese and ranch dressing. Top-notch. Met the owner and gave him my compliments and rewarded me with a delicious hot pie."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners! Food tastes very fresh and the price is very fair. I'll be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Is ZERO stars an option? This place had the absolute worst service ever. They took over an hour and half to get me my food, got smart when I called, claimed it was a problem the driver was having but then slipped up and said, \"I just put it in. It'll be ready in a few,\" then when the delivery DID arrive ignored the \"Call First\" note and rang the doorbell. Then tried to get cash from me after I prepaid! Aside from that is the food, yes, they have some awesome topping choices, but why is it, out of 3 times I tried them out, the pizza was never cut right. Twice the pizza was dry, like barely any sauce, and skimpy with the toppings."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WORST PIZZA EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
We ordered two pizzas, wings and fries for $65. The pizza looked like it was microwaved, the wings are dry and tasteless, and the fries were plain and soggy. We tried to refuse the order after having to pay $12 for delivery and the manager refused to work with us. Driver and passenger both smoking in the car while handling food. Drive car with no plates and then said would give us discount of $20 and after having to call the Police they only said they would give us $10. Save your money and buy food somewhere else. Any place would be better than here."}
{"text":"We stopped here to get some pizza and chicken wings on the way to a friend's house because the other halal pizza place was close. We ordered a large half pepperoni and half cheese pizza and half bucket of bbq and half hot wings. I didn't try any of them but my husband said the pizza was good while the wings were ok. 

The owner was a nice guy and kept apologizing since the wings were taking a long time to be ready. He kept coming to us if we wanted anything and offered us drinks but we declined since it was not his fault. In the end he kinda 'forced' us to take 2 slices of cheesecakes. lol."}
{"text":"This place is great, the food is excellent and they deliver in the wee hours of the morning. They have one of the best pepperoni pizzas around. The delivery driver, Mark, was also super cool. He was fast and friendly, and genuinely hoped we enjoyed our food. This is my go to spot late at night, I recommend them highly."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing and they are open late. The staff is super friendly and they take the time out to know their customers. Best pizza in town. Fast delivery and just overall honest hard workers. I order at least twice a week and I'm a professional cook."}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly! Even had a fun time talking on the phone & ordering. Warm & welcoming delivery. Definitely would order from here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas! Plus the guys that serve it are extremely nice. 

The 10 dollar xl pizza special is eaten by me at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Basically it was pizza hut quality pizza with halal ingredients. Halal was a surprise to me, however. I thought they just had halal options, didn't know that they were going to sell me sausage and ham that had no pork whatsoever.

If you are looking for halal pizza, ignore this review. If you are not looking for halal pizza, I would ignore all the other reviews, and don't expect any pork on your pizza.

When I learned there would be no pork, I considered just walking out without the pizza, and writing off the $12. I decided to stay and at least try the pizza, because the boss was nice and told me I could have my money back if I didn't like it. I regret that decision. I didn't care about the money, I just want that ten minutes of my life back.

I have nothing against halal food, if this place had decent shawerma I would probably eat there 5 times a week. Instead they have halal pizza."}
{"text":"only had the pizza...was kind of a last second try, never been/never heard of it.
I have to say..I love great surprises like this! great pizza!!
Just the owner there, good guy.

I'll be back to try everything else on the menu, that is a guarantee
Highly recomended- get a way from the chains and other garbage and give him a try!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza around 1 and didn't get it is 2 something in the morning. The pizza wasn't great. I ordered bacon on it and it didn't come with it. They need better customer service over the phone as well. Not eating here again"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed in this joint.  Half bucket of wings consist of 11 wings? Smh

And garlic balls..... Wth was that?"}
{"text":"Wow this pizza place is great I always wanted to experience having a slice of pepperoni but I do not eat pork great that they have substitutions like turkey bacon and beef pepperoni with also having a great customer service and a friendly atmosphere I hope to be coming back for many many years"}
{"text":"A well deserved 5 stars. The owner Frank always treats you like family. He really puts passion in the food he makes and deserves all the success.

Perfect crust, well balanced sauce and quality ingredients. Try the Supreme Pizza! The Chicken fingers are super good too."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! We ordered an XL Pepporini Pizza for $9.50.....when my husband went to go pick it up the manager was not there and the kid did not know how to run a credit card so they wrote down all his info, which was sketchy.  The pizza was very small, 8 pieces and looked like cardboard. The pizza was cold,  the dough was not even cooked all the way through....was horrible!! Kids didn't even like it.  We've been before and it was really good, but seem like it's different people this time. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good,  nothing amazing. Do not order here for delivery though,  they are extremely slow. I live across the street from here basically and it took them a whole hour and a half to deliver 2 items to me. Prices are good for what you're getting,  just go pick it up though,  unless you like waiting."}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a friend. Excellent customer service, excellent food, and great atmosphere to be in. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I needed something late and Sorrento's really did the job. At 3 am we went in and the owner was very kind. Despite how early it was he made fresh Lasagna and meatballs. This was some of the best lasagna I've ever had, it even reheated perfectly because the food quality was so high.  The meatballs were tender and not from a box which was awesome.  I will be coming here again and you should too no matter the time of day because the food will be fresh and the service excellent and friendly. There are plenty of pizza shops but this is a slice above the rest."}
{"text":"Military family orders in at the courtyard Marriott the guy who took out order asked how we would like to pay I said card he said they prefer cash I said that could be updated on the website, and receives pizza an hour later after being told 30-35 minutes, to be called by the delivery person and asked to meet her in the lobby because she didn't feel like walking to the room, also she had the audacity to ask,  \"would you like your change?\" When I said yes she sucked her teeth and said she didn't have change on her, and had to ask the front desk, wow!!! Since when does a driver not have change? then we received it with brown long stringy hair in the cheese! This is the worse experience ever during a pcs! I would never reorder. Recommend refund, no answer from owner."}
{"text":"Rather inconsistent quality, hours, and options.  We work across the parking lot and many days no one is there at Sorrento for lunch.   Their hours seem to vary based on when they want to work.  We stopped frequenting there much.

The food changes based on who is cooking.  I used to really like their garlic bread then one day they gave me garlic bread which was literally a huge crouton it was so old and hard.

We work right nearby and at first they said they would give us 20% off then they said that was too much and they will only do 10% off.  Now, when I ask for my 10% discount, they try and tack on the difference somewhere else- \"credit card usage fee\".  Really shady.

I am a business owner and know this is no way to treat a loyal customer.

The salad I just bought today was $8 with garlic bread- but it's all ice berg lettuce.  It probably cost them $2.  I ask for the discount and the guy wouldn't even give it to me.  I should have avoided this place but only went because it is so close."}
{"text":"Pizza was average. I ordered ultimate pepperoni, but it was anything but ultimate. I read the reviews & as soon as I placed the order I called to make sure the pizza would be delivered within the hour, & the person who answered the phone said it would be at least an hour because the driver wasn't there. So I looked for other places that were open, and decided to cancel & reorder from Napoli's but when I called to cancel, the same person said they didn't know how to refund, and they would make sure the pizza would be delivered in 30 mins. It's 12:54 when we got it, we ordered at 12:15. So a little over but better than I expected. The two stars is for the speed of delivery & the pizza was good. I'm glad I called."}
{"text":"Hands down worst delivery I've ever had through the Eat24 service. I ordered at about 2 in the morning they're one of the only pizza places open. I ordered a chicken Philly and mozzarella sticks. In the special instructions I told them to call me when they arrived at the door. I received a call from the delivery driver saying he couldn't find the building asking me what number it was. I'm not sure what my building number is who really is. So I gave him instructions on where to find the house at which point he was very rude and told me to come out into the street to get my food. I told him to do his job and go back to the gate and look at the map to find my apartment just like every other delivery driver has in the past. I had given him clear instructions on how to find the place and he had my address. Finally I received my food and I opened the bag to find no napkins or condiments. No marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks or Ranch. No ketchup for my fries. Cold soggy chicken Philly. And cold hard mozzarella sticks. Needless to say after this experience I won't be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The pizza is always hot and fresh. The owners are friendly and easy to talk to. Last week I had a sub sandwich, and loved it! Next week, I'm going to try the wings."}
{"text":"I ordered this pizza earlier and I was absolutely blown away by how delicious it was! I'm not one to write reviews but after trying it I told myself I had to write something nice. I ordered the buffalo pizza and it's beyond good. The owner who took my order was extremely friendly and just had an overall great experience coming here."}
{"text":"$80.00 for 2 small pizzas and 14 fingers and didn't even deliver this hot cheese not melted said we are supposed to have a number of fingers dint have it asked for a refund they said bring it back we had to drive it back all the food didn't touch it don't want it and brought it back and the guy argued with us wouldn't give us a refund with all the food sitting on his table worst place ever.  Was grown in a restaurant and we would make it better by taking care of you this guy said I can't do that I can only make you food.  We didn't touch it we don't want other food.  Horrible service and I'm in the casino industry"}
{"text":"Someone posted pics of a damn fried chicken head yuck!!!!!!! My thing is that I agree it is totally absurd but.....are they to inspect every single wing before they fry it? I'm just being real. To the guy or girl who posted it I agree with you to an extent but who is at fault the people who sold the meat or the buyer??? Just think about it. Try to get a business shut down or a bad rep for someone else's mistake is not even fair. Just sayin"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza out for the first time. This location is the old Tropicana Pizza at Washington and Rainbow behind 7-11. I like the owner being there 1st of all. I had pizza and fingers. I missed using the 2 for 1 but that was my bad. The pizza itself was delish.I had the sausage lovers with olives and mushrooms added on. The sauce is the key here. The dough is soft and chewy. If you are looking for that crispy bottom with a little bite its not here, but its still a great pizza. 
they charge a fee to use CC. One dollar"}
{"text":"Worst delivery ever, I waited two hours to receive my food... still waiting as I write this. Ordered at 1am and it's 2:49am. I literally live like 2 minutes away.. simple order.. also very rude on phone."}
{"text":"Been eating at sorrentos for a couple years now, probably as much as 3-5 times a month. Something about there crust keeps me coming back. Unfortunately after today, I'll probably never be back. I like supporting small, local businesses and would never go out of my way to hurt one But sorrentos needs change. I was told my order would be ready in 20 minutes (I showed up 30 minutes later due to them usually not being ready on time). There was a 2-3 year old child walking around the kitchen and my order hadn't even been started. I was apologized to and told it would be 15 minutes more. A half hour later was given a pepperoni pizza with 10 slices of pepperoni and what looks like left over chicken Parmesan. Hopefully this place can get there act together, but I'll probably never return to find out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza! The fact that the pepperoni has a yummy kick to it and it's not pork pepperoni is amazing! My boyfriend can actually enjoy the pizza with me! As a matter of fact just writing this is making me crave it, so guess what I'm getting it tonight! And favorite part they are open late!!! Woohooo pizza and movie night!!!! Can't wait to get out of work and eat!!!!"}
{"text":"this pizza place was really good. the older guy that was there was super nice and down to earth. the other girl that works there was also very nice and made great conversation with my boyfriend and I. they treat the customers amazing well at least they did with us. the girl was even going to give us drinks and offered to pay for them. we ate the whole pizza and didnt leave a bite. i will definitely be coming back to this pizza place."}
{"text":"Im a repeat customer. I've only had them deliver my food once and it took awhile. I usually go inside. Nice size portions, good food, and at a reasonable price. Nice atomosphere lovely customer service feels like family."}
{"text":"First time ordering. They sent a med instead of the large we ordered and there was a metal piece in the crust of the pizza.  We regularly use the eat24 app and trust what they have on there.  This new place was a total bust!"}
{"text":"Halal pizza open till very late. Always a friendly welcome from the staff (a husband and wife team). Also has great wings. A little off the beaten path but worth it if you are craving some halal, NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible company. I had ordered food at around midnight, and it was expected to come at 1:35. The food did not come until 2:45 AM. I called the next day because they had also given me items I didn't even order, I ordered a Chicken Pasta and was given a soggy sandwich with fries. When I called the manager and staff was extremely rude and had called me a bitch and said they were calling the police for harassment because I had called a second time after being put on hold for 20 minutes. I didn't even eat the food because it wasn't what I wanted and it was cold and gross. Thought they would honor their customers and own up for their mistakes but I was terribly mistaken and will never be eating or ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Never been to this place. Unfortunately when my husband ordered food to be delivered we waited 2 hours!!!! So we called the restaurant to ask what the heck was going on (keep in mind we live 5 mins away from this place)! The guy Mohamed said he couldn't do anything for us that we had to wait? I hate receiving bad customer service, all my life I've worked customer service. So I hate when I receive bad customer service"}
{"text":"Last night I just order DV pizza for my 2 boys, 12\" they so hungry they can eat it all I don't believe it, it's great pizza
But they have to wait so long more than hour to eat maybe so busy at night the pizza still hot and good"}
{"text":"Excellent and delicious food! Every time we come to LV we try to eat here. It's Halal so the meat is clean and tasty. The pizza, beef & chicken burgers, fries, and chicken tenders have all been beyond great! And I love the service here. Very friendly place and I wish they were in my area so I could enjoy their food and great service more often. My entire family loves the food and I'm looking forward to eating there again soon!"}
{"text":"this place seem promising since it's open late at night but when we tried to make out order this dood was no help!! we called multiple times and this person did not want to accommodate our order. we tried our best to make our order but he would not understand. instead he hung up 3 times which is very inconvenient for us. do not order frim this place because they dont care about you !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just horrible. Not much else to it. Sorry to give it 1 star. But it's not good whatsoever. Nothing there is good. Everything taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza! Very hard to find in LV and they deliver. Friendly staff, will definitely be ordering from here from now on."}
{"text":"just order pizza and garlic fries. delivery was on time but... My garlic fries are very stale and you can tell they aren't fresh fries. would give them 5 stars but I'll try again when the time comes."}
{"text":"Poor pizza and customer service. It looks like 7-11 pizza that has been sitting out for a day. Cracker thin crust with tomato sauce on it. Horrible pizza and seriously overpriced."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, asked for specific toppings and got it exactly how I wanted it, super tasty, hot, everything homemade, sauce was delicious, good amount of cheese, crust nice and crispy, and it was a reasonable price, will definitely order again.
They're open till 3am and deliver EVERYWHERE!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times, each time its always a 45min + wait. There has neber been more than maybe 2 people in the dining area so not sure why that long of a wait. This time i came to get my food(already paid online) the front door is locked, it says their hours are mon-sun 11am-3am, right now its 410pm. So i stand outsode for a few minutes seeing if anyone comes to the door... Nothing. So i get in my car and call them, they got my order tell me its an additional 10minutes. I proceed to tell them the front door is locked and that im here, the guy apologized and hung up. This is probably the worst service ive ever had, i have to wait in my car rather than inside like a normal business. Needlesa to say I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK HERE AND I WILL LET EVERYONE KNOW ABOUT THIS RIDICULOUS ORDEAL."}
{"text":"First and last time.
Ordered at 12:55 am
Order arrived 2:39 am
Pizza cold
Side dishes cold
I told the driver and paid.
I called and talked to the manager who offered to bring me replacement food
Food arrived 3:26am
Driver was an ass. Bitched and lied about the distance he had to drive.
Then extortion was his next game. Paid a second time for one side dish, that was too much missing according to him. this time the side was warm, just paying twice chapped my ass.
 What a joke.
Unamerican service. 
Felt like I was in Europe and there was zero concept of service.
Food was just when it was warm."}
{"text":"This place was extremely disappointing.  Ordered two pizzas,  some fries,  and wings.  The food took 2 hours to be delivered and all the food was dry and cold when they finally got here. 

The pizzas are microwaveable and not handmade, the fries were soft and soggy, and  the wings were small and dry (see my photos). There are much better options around.  Don't waste your time and money with this place."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Pizza looks microwavable, looks nothing like it's photo on their website. I have added my photo to prove it. Driver did not want to give us our money back when we checked the pizza. Please look at my photos, it says it all. We paid $62.71."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!! I had the Super Supreme Pizza! Great pizza without any pork! I have been searching for a pizza place that does not serve pork and here it is!! I cannoy wait to come back with the fam! Mohammad is great!! He will make sure you are happy with your visit! I will be back and soon!!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!
They robbed me for an extra $20
They did not bring me the right order.
They were an hour and 40 minutes late
I spent $40 on an order that was $19.99
Talked to the manager and I was polite, he told me to hold on and then hung up. I called back and they did not answer
Robbed me for $20, BEWARE
I would not recommend this place to anyone 
Food is not great at all!"}
{"text":"...the pizza was amazing; everything fresh or homemade. The crust was cooked to perfection and the 'extra cheese' was perfect as well; not too much, nor too little...just 'extra'. I love that this shop actually has fresh garlic and that the meat is all kosher...and delicious! The location is under new management and they are sticklers for quality, both in product and service. They have a diverse menu so if you're hungry for more than pizza, it's there! Even Gyros! I've found my new 'pizza place'! Try the garlic pizza....SO good!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good balance of sauce, cheese and crust.   Customer service was OK, however, the wait was a little long.   Happy to get pizza delivered to my house at 1am"}
{"text":"Order was 3 hours late and my order was wrong. The spaghetti was good but everything else tasted horrible."}
{"text":"Ordering from this place was a nightmare. Sorrento's pizza and its owners are crooks who tried to scam me by voiding my order, but not refunding the money I was charged.  So now instead of them just simply refunding my money, I have to file a dispute with my bank. Over $13...

On April 23rd I ordered a cheese pizza and wings for pickup. This place is about a half of mile away and I was told my order would be ready for pickup in a half hour. So I show up after a half hour and I was told that my order wasn't ready because they didn't have any cheese. They said the cheese was \"on its way\" and they would deliver my order free of charge for the inconvenience. 

So about another 30 minutes passes, it's getting late and my kids are getting hungry. I call and I was told the cheese still hadn't arrived but it would be there shortly and my order would be ready in another 30 mins. I waited an hour and called back and was told that it was almost done. At this point, I had already ordered pizza from somewhere else and wanted to just cancel my order. 

About 30 mins after that, 2 and a half hours after I initially placed my order, I hear a knock at the door. We're already sitting down eating pizza from the second the place I ordered from. I open the door and the general manager of Sorrento's pizza is at the door with the order I canceled. 2 and a half hours after I placed the order. He said he wanted to personally deliver the pizza. I told him I had already gotten pizza and I just wanted my money back. He offered to give me 50% off which I declined and told him I just wanted my money back. 

I placed the order on April 23rd. My bank processes refunds fairly quickly so after a few days of not seeing the charge reversed, I went in to Sorrento's to see what was going on. The general manager assured me that he voided the order and even printed out a receipt stating the order was voided and the hold up must be on my bank's side. 

So it is now May 4th and the charge still hadn't been reversed. I called my bank and was told that Sorrento's pizza had just voided the order, but never issued a refund and I would have to file a dispute which would take another 2 weeks. All over $13. Totally unprofessional and shady!!"}
{"text":"They have very tasty burgers. Ive ordered from their place a few times and was satisfied every time. My favorite burger is the double bacon cheeseburger. Ive also tried the mushroom swiss and that was also super yummy! a good appetizer for me would be their garlic balls. a good snack"}
{"text":"Last night (really, this morning at 12:30 am) was my first visit to Sorrento Pizza. It was delicious - the toppings were fresh, the crust was just right, and it wasn't dripping with grease. Best of all, Sorrento is open til 3 am and is only four minutes from my house. Hard to believe I hadn't been there before now, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A little sassy customer service sometimes but overall good people & the best tasting pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"We love this place, specially because it's all halal!!
There's so many bad reviews about this place yet I find it to be wrong , I've ordered from them at least 5 times and never had a problem. The only thing bad that I have to say about this place is the delivery charge ! Otherwise it's all good."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food service and atmosphere! The pizza was phenomenal. It reminded me of the type of takeout we used to get when I was a kid. You could tell the chef (who I think also might have been the owner) puts a lot of heart into it. The coolest part was kust how friendly and personable he was.  Without being intrusive, he sat and chatted with my wife and I throughout (almost) our entire lunch. It was really a wonderful experience and it felt good to know that small businesses like that are still around and there are still places you can go that make you feel like they actually care about you enjoying yourself. I highly recommend this joint to everyone!"}
{"text":"The service at this place was by far the worst I have ever dealt with. The person who delivered the food appeared to be either intoxicated or sleep deprived, the food was not cooked to liking, they did not actually pay attention to the additional notes, and when I called I was treated poorly and they seemed to just make excuses and after I called him out on his excuses he started cursing and saying they did nothing wrong and I was just complaining. I will NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"i work in the neighborhood and have seen this place for years, but for some reason didn't stop in until today.  i wish i had tried this place sooner! i was surprised to find they offer a LOT more than just pizza, like pasta, salads, subs, chicken wings and chicken fingers too.  so anyway i had the gyro sandwich and was really happy with my choice.  the gyro meat was not greasy tasting at all, and the sour cream tzatziki (spelling?!) sauce and garnishes were just right.  i will definitely come back to try the pizza or other offerings"}
{"text":"The pictures of the food look nothing like the food we got id rather buy a pizza at 7-11 that actually tastes good compared to this place never again."}
{"text":"I love eating there large calzone and eat there all the time. There Italian sub and fries. There fries are also to die for. I always talk the place up to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Me and my twin really enjoyed the food I have their magnet on my fridge the next time I order it's going to be from them"}
