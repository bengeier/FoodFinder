{"text":"DO NOT ORDER WINGIN' OUT ON EAT-CU. 

I went to pick up my food 45 minutes after my order only to find that they had not received my order despite me having an e-mail saying they did. 

Not only did I have to wait even longer for my food, the cashier was rude to me and there was confusion on whether or not I was being charged twice for my food. My credit card information was taken on Eat CU, but the cashier asked me to pay again. 

The owner called me personally a few hours later and said that this is how they do things with Eat CU which was nice of them but it is still  very confusing/sketchy for me to give out my credit card information twice for wings that some how didn't come through even though I had an e-mail saying they did.

The wings were good, comparable to BW3's but the hassle of getting them is not worth it."}
{"text":"Ehh. The food came slow. There was no service, they looked like zombies in the back not even talking to each other. The place remains janky after the 3 years I've been here. 

The food is pricy if you don't buy wings in bulk. The sauces were good and the \"wings\" are actually chicken strips and they're huge."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place. I was here on the day it opened, and I was approached by the owner looking for advice and tips on improving it. Wings were at or above Buffalo Wild Wings quality, and given the hours (long, open late at night) and prices (attractive combo option) I expect this place to do well."}
{"text":"If I'm paying $1 for a wing it better be a damned good wing!! The food here is underwhelming. The boneless wings are fried extra crispy when they should be soft. The boned wings are mushy when they should be fried crispy. I've had pink meat from here before. All of their sauces, mozarella sticks, fries are bought right from the grocery store (take a peak in the back). The only reason this place is still in business is because they are open late and are a right across the street from a bar. 

They almost always get my order wrong. Not acceptable service even if most of their clientele is drunk."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, what's with the negative reviews?
Can you say DRUNK FOOD?

This place is heaven at 1-2am any night of the week, its delicious and potentially nutritious. You can tell from the outside you're not going to get the fanciest wing eating experience, but for what it is you're going to get your fill.
(I suggest splitting with friends)

OmNomNom

BONUS: going after a night of drinking is like dinner theater:
Wings + watching Red Lion chaos across the street.

{"text":"Decent wings, I got the regular buffalo sauce (seemed to be Franks Red Hot). Fries were a little stale and I thought it would come with bleu cheese. However, the delivery was reasonably fast and the service was good, I forgot to put what kind of pop I wanted online and they called me right away to fix it."}
{"text":"If Wingin Out had a mother, it would be very hard for her to say \"I'm proud of you, son.\" But Wingin Out doesn't have a mother, because Wingin Out is the product of a back-alley abortion. 

If you remember eating at the old restaurant at 301 Green, congratulations! You're the only person to have eaten at Niro's Gyros without being blacked out! The apparent goal of Wingin Out is simply to not be as bad as Niro's. 

At first glance, Wingin Out looks like a wing joint from the streets of Kabul. But once you get inside, it's actually more like a wing joint from the streets of Baghdad. You're first blown away by the lack of anything on the walls. Seriously. There is literally nothing on the walls. Not even a menu. For items and prices, just ask the guy behind the cash register who probably has more experience selling MDMA than chicken wings. I noticed that the water is served in 8-oz plastic cups, and poured from the utility sink in the back. This gives it a nice, warm, cloudy, 'I feel like I'm in an African prison' type essence. 

Now brace yourself--I'm going to say something good about this place. They don't pull punches with the wing sauce. You'll be shitting battery acid before you have time to brush your teeth the next morning. 

But the worst thing by far: the wings are breaded. Honestly. I'm not kidding. They're fucking breaded buffalo wings. The last person who enjoyed breaded buffalo wings died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound in the bathroom of a Nevada Hooters in 1989. Breaded wings should be outlawed for public safety reasons. 

The guys who run Wingin Out take restauranteurism about as seriously as Joe Paterno took child abuse--\"Ah, fuck it. It'll figure itself out.\" 

But there's always hope for the Wingin Out empire. Drunk college students aren't rational consumers. Shitty food seems to find a place to fester at 301 Green, and if Niro's could last for as long as it did, then anything is possible. It's like the radioactive contamination at Chernobyl--there's no way to get rid of it and it will be there forever.

And it will give you cancer."}
{"text":"It's a great place to stop at after a night at the bars. The food isn't too expensive. They aren't the cleanest restaurant and they sometimes are very slow when it's late at night and the bars just get out. However, if wings is what you are looking for, wingin out is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Disappointing wings. I tried the boned wings in medium buffalo and citrus chipotle. The sauces were good enough, but the wings themselves had no crisp to them, just that wet, mushy layer of soaked breading that is the hallmark of bleh buffalo wings. Particularly considering the quality, prices were nothing to write home about, either. I'd prefer BDubs to this."}
{"text":"Best cheese fries i have ever had.
Its designed to be a carryout place. The wings are ok though a little overpriced i think. The saving grace for the place is the awesome cheese fries that i fell instantly in love with. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"My experience began with calling in an order for pickup. I ordered 20 wings and mozzarella sticks. When I showed up, they had a 10 order of wings and the sticks. So the girl behind the counter puts in another order for 10. This results in having to wait longer and pay more for 2 orders of 10 instead of 1 of 20. This alone earned them 3 stars.

The wings themselves were poor quality. They were soggy and very generic. The only redeeming quality was the fact the wings were huge.

Will not be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place twice and let me tell you CHAMPAIGN - URBANA! This place ROCKS! The wings are great! Service is fast! Prices are reasonable. Wing in Out is a gold mine!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of wings, and this place does not disappoint.

They are open late, and their wings are just delicious. I usually order delivery when I get Wingin Out, and it usually doesn't take too long.

The one issue I would have is that they are rather expensive for the quantity of the wings. They are open later than Wingstop or Buffalo Wild Wings, so when it's late at night and I really want wings, I usually end up paying the more expensive price."}
{"text":"The wings are big, plumb and juicy.  The prices are reasonable.  There is no atmosphere to this place.  It 's a true dive but the wings are ok."}
{"text":"I had kind of low expectations for this place.  Being that it's target audience is the drunk crowd.

I was completely surprised by how good and crisp the wings are.  I got 7 insane buffalo wings, I love spice, and these blew me away.  I could barely handle the heat but yet I can't wait to get them again.  The ranch they use to go with their wings and celery is excellent.

Highly recommend this small, dumpy looking place for some actually excellent, non breaded fresh and crispy SPICY wings!"}
{"text":"Ordered 1 pound of boneless wings in two sauces and bread bites. With delivery, total came to about $23...so not cheap at all.
Delivery took about same time as a pizza order.

Wings were not small/medium wings like at Buffalo Wild Wings but were chicken fingers. They were dry, with little actual sauce on them. They were overcooked and chewy. Very underwhelming.

Bread bites tasted like small breadsticks and were fine.

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I will start by saying, my food was great and I am satisfied with it both in quality and in price. However, I ordered delivery, and the service wasn't great. I ordered on a Wednesday night and the small order I made took over an hour before it was delivered. When the delivery driver finally arrived, I received a call that he was outside. There are no obstructions or security barriers between my front door and the street in front of my building or the parking lot behind it, but for whatever reason I had to go across the street to meet the driver to retrieve my order, which I found very strange. The food was good, but I don't think it was worth the hour long wait and I will likely not order here again."}
{"text":"Visiting the son at U of I, late night stop.  

Would of should of could of kept on going.... 

Wings were meaty, yes, possibly undercooked.. yea, I am goin with that.  

Place was crawling with cops... 

Expensive wings, undercooked with company lurking that I didnt care for.  Personally, I would take a pass.  - that's that.... Laura,.. wingin' out.  Lol. Nerd."}
{"text":"A big improvement over the old Niro's Gyros.  They installed their new sign on Wednesday, January 18, 2012."}
{"text":"Best milkshake EVER!!  This place doesn't look like much at all but their milkshake are hand spun , thick, and delicious.  I ordered strawberry and it was fantastic.  I can't wait to try some of their other flavors (like Rice Krispies flavor!!). They have great wings too,...but you must try their milkshakes."}
{"text":"My husband and I like Wingin Out and have ordered delivery from them at least three times. We found out about them when they put a flier on our door. Tonight we placed an order for delivery to find out we live out of their delivery zone. No idea why they had no problems delivering in the past but I guess their policy has always been no more than 2 miles out (we are 4.5) and now they won't deliver to us. So just FYI for anyone that lives more than 2 miles away, they won't deliver to you even if they have delivered to you in the past. And it's not advertised anywhere on their website that I could find."}
{"text":"Amazing Wings.Great place. Great Service. affordable"}
{"text":"Ordered late-night delivery and got my wings super quick. I like honey mustard and buffalo the best...mac bites are legit too. Definitely will order from here again"}
{"text":"To be honest, the food is really good and the service sufficed. But the thing that bothered me was last night, the line was long and there were a lot of drunken people so its not surprising for the cashier and anything to be im a rush. On my order taking, i asked the cashier if all condiments are free but celery and he said yes (as written on the menu board as well). So I bought the condiment and when I checked my receipt apparently they CHARGED me for a supposedly free condiment.

I am hoping Wingin Out can learn in this mistake for future reference.

(PS: I still keep the receipt as well considering it the condiment should be of no charge.)"}
{"text":"For the money, it's not too bad.  I used to order delivery pretty frequently on campus and they had pretty quick delivery times.  Sometimes they gave me way more than I ordered, I'm pretty sure I somehow ended up with 4lbs when I ordered 2lbs once.  Perfect drunk food, but I wouldn't eat it sober."}
{"text":"I only had a single wing and it was just subpar. The wait was very long. Plus the smallest number of wings you can order is 7 which is kind of ridiculous. Maybe would go again passed midnight only though."}
{"text":"My favorite insane buffalo wings. I am kinda addicted to the insane spiciness. It just hit your tongue and then your month is on fire. Lol"}
{"text":"Their chicken tender is really good with source put aside. Wings need to be more well done, and you always want to take out caz their table are kind of dirty."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up some wings for dinner the night after a party.

The guy at the register was very kind.

We ordered 1.5lbs of the boneless wings with honey bbq, chipotle and garlic parmesan sauce, plus a chocolate shake.

The wings themselves were pretty big, and definitely meaty, definitely more substantial than Buffalo Wild Wings. The sauces that came on them were all pretty good. I personally liked the chipotle the best out of all of them, just the right amount of kick. I thought the honey bbq was a little sweet though, and the parmesan garlic a tad bit salty.

The chocolate shake was good, but expensive.

Overall not bad. It seems a little expensive, over $12/person including our shake for a good, but not huge portion of wings."}
{"text":"The service was great everyone is friendly. I was sober and the food was great! They have really good fries. Their boneless wings are so good. They are kind of like chicken tenders since they are made with real chicken unlike other boneless wings. Others are usually processed."}
{"text":"They gave me 3 wings, the smallest amount of fries and forgot all my sauces and then I called and complained and they said they can't do anything about it. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED"}
