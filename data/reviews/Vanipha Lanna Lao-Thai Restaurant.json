{"text":"I was disappointed. The prices led me to believe I'd be getting fresh food and quick service. Neither appeared. The food was good, but not great, and given the odd hours that they have, it's hard to catch them when they're actually open. They're not able to bring the order for about 15-20 minutes... All in all, it's not very accessible, nor fantastically tasty. I haven't attempted to go back."}
{"text":"An extremely spacious restaurant with the typically beautiful decor found in 99.99% of all thai restaurants.  There is a small parking lot in front for maybe 8 - 10 cars.    Thom Yum soup was salty and a little over-priced.  Average in taste.  Had two Laotian dishes - chicken laab and Sean Nam Tok.  Both were pretty good but I regret not ordering the beef laab instead.  Both dishes were very mildly spicy - if you are hoping for spicy, make sure you request it.    Emerald chicken curry - average  Khao Pho - average  Laotian sticky rice - 5 stars!!!!!!!  Khao Glum Nho Sungkhaya (Sticky rice, egg custard) - 5++++ stars!!!!!  Please try this.  Its amazing.  I will be coming back to this restaurant simply for this dessert.  Khao Nheew Mamuang (Coconut sticky rice, mango) - 3.75 stars.  The restaurant offers a special 8 course meal for $35/ person but you must provide 24 hours advance notice.  Restaurant is closed on Sundays and Mondays."}
{"text":"Vanipha Lanna is the best Thai I've had in the area - tasty, with good ingredients.  It's big and airy, with mildly wacky decor (orchid fountain, anyone?).  I wish they would open the area with the Japanese-style low tables for customers.  Remember, it's not open on Mondays!  They're gluten-free friendly."}
{"text":"The Laotian dishes here are worth a special trip. I tried the rice cooked in banana leaves with taro root and black bean, the mango salad and the fresh rolls. I recommend it all and the spicy peanut sauce is a nice compliment. Our server was very knowledgeable and well spoken. Next time I go to Vanipha I'll be sure to have a bigger appetite so I can try some vegetarian entrees."}
{"text":"Someone suggest  that we go to Vanipha Lanna Lao-Thai Restaurant for some authentic Lao Cuisine!  I tried calling for a reservation and the lady inform me that they no longer run the restaruant only providing catering services! :("}
