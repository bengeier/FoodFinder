{"text":"Went for the Cheap Dogs...No More!   Dogs are Smaller! Not worth the price.  Cutting back on the Condiments is not helping.."}
{"text":"Kind of odd that there is a limit of 3 hot dogs per person , not 2 or 4 .. But 3  lol"}
{"text":"Hot dogs here are legit. They are super good but can be bit of a long line to wait for them. I've seen the line get as long as 10 or 15 people, I suppose that's cause the taste is top notch for these hot dogs. If you're craving a hot dog this is a good option."}
{"text":"Great dogs,  nice price.  Sit down and enjoy a good hot dog.  Toppings ate plenty sauerkraut, onions,  relish,  ketchup, mustard, peppers, salt, pepper,  just the way you like it."}
{"text":"Of all the places I've been to in Vegas, I didn't think I would run to review a hot dog cart, but here I am. I stayed at the Grandview next door and found myself coming here at least three times for the lunch of champions. The hot dogs are a decent size for $1.25.  As others have said, the limit is three per person, but I found that to be more than enough. If you really want more, bring friends or wait until the shift change. The best thing is that these things are hot and as \"fresh\" as a hot dog can be. I burnt my mouth on my first dog and was not even bothered. The condiments? Fuhgeddaboudit! They have anything you could want on a hot dog.

Definitely recommend this hot dog cart. There was never a wait when I went."}
{"text":"If you haven't had one of these, please try them! These are some good hot dogs! I was staying at the hotel and saw something mentioning the dog cart. I hadn't eaten all day and decided to have one. The young lady puts whatever you want on it. That hot dog was good! It was hot and a little juicy...yes juicy! Didn't make it too far before going back for another one. Thank goodness the line wasn't long. You can't beat $1.25 for a good hot dog."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a hot dog at any hot of the day. Stop wasting time add get it loaded with sauerkraut!!!"}
{"text":"Great value. Juicy dog with sauerkraut yummy. I get them every time I attend Watersmart conference"}
{"text":"$1.25 for a decent, not amazing, but decent dog with toppings. They don't  come close to a Costco dog but you are not at Costco either."}
{"text":"There's a general rule in Vegas: if it takes you away from gambling, you'll pay for it. Food can be not cheap in Vegas, notably in a casino. The 75 cent hot dog cart (near the sports book, open 11 am to 5 pm) is great. Unlike Ikea hot dogs (50 cents in the USA, 75 cents in Canada), The South Point hot dog cart also provides onions. The only thing that slows down the line is the person manning the cart also puts on the condiments. Then again, nothing worse than getting behind a person at Ikea who acts like it's the first time they've ever tried to put condiments on anything."}
{"text":"The hot dog cart comes in mighty handy when one is gambling in the sports book. We were here a year ago and the dogs were 75 cents; they've had a 67% price increase to $1.25 now, but I still ate my fair share this trip. All beef, juicy, fat, on a fresh bun. You won't get a gourmet dog here, but they're mighty tasty."}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs at a great price. Not much else to say. Go get yourself a couple and enjoy. I don't think you will regret it. There is a line sometimes but have personally never waited more than a few minutes. Check it out !"}
{"text":"These are the Best All Beef hotdogs in South Las Vegas. *ok so there compareable to Costco quality...but for $1.25. They have the regular condiments.. mustard..ketchup..white onions and relish...and for those of you that have an acquired a taste for sauerkraut...yah.. that's available..
The dog's are always juicy...Never over cooked...and the buns are steamed so they are soft and warm. I like mine bun..mustard.. white onions and DOG ON TOP!
That way it traps those sneaky little condiments right where I want them and not down the front of my shirt where they would inevitably fall! Oh yeah.. the ladies are lightning quick with a set of tongs! So there might be a long line but it's always a short wait.. *They've been at the South Point serving up hotdogs since 2005.. and they are quick to smile if you chat them up! Definately worth it!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Grandview next door and it was inevitable that at some point in the trip my wife and would be dining on Vienna hot dogs at the South Point.  Hot dogs are $1.25 with condiments included.  A great, light lunch."}
{"text":"It's 75 cents people. You get a hot dog with mustard, relish, onions and/or ketchup. The only bad thing is sometimes the line is long. One cannot complain if you're getting food for less than a dollar."}
{"text":"After staying at this casino for a few day I can honest say the best place to eat is the hot dog cart. Its literally the same kind of set up one would find at a local county fair or carnival.  It would also be nice to have it open 24 hrs because getting a decent meal at this casino is nearly impossible.  For only $1 you can get an all natural hot dog and load it up with lots of fixings.  It says something when the line at a hot dog cart is longer than the line for the casino's buffet."}
{"text":"My friend and I (Anaheim legend and newly crowned mayor of Denver Wayne Lhommedieu) stayed at South Point for the March Madness Basketball Tourney this past week. During our stay we stopped by the South Point Hot Dog Cart a number of times throughout our trip. The cart is conveniently next to the sports book and a great way to get a quick delicious snack without missing any game action. The cart is cash only, the cost is $1.25, with a limit of three dogs per person. As far as condiments they have: mustard, ketchup, diced onions, sweet relish, and sauerkraut. I prefer to order mine with mustard and onion where as The Mayor is more of a kraut man. If you happen to be at the South Point I highly recommend stopping by the cart for a great quick bite."}
{"text":"Simple, it's a cart with $1.25 Vienna Beef hot dogs with a limit of 3 per customer. Your choices are ketchup, mustard, relish, onions or sauerkraut. It's not the old Barbary Coast hot dogs but tough to complain about a cheap dog. If you don't like it, oh well, it was a $1.25. There are plenty of places to eat in the South Point Casino."}
{"text":"This is the best deal in town or at the hotel you need to go between 11am to 5 pm but some days they run out. There will be a line but a hotdog for 75 cents awesome  there is no drinks there just hot dogs  take the time to have one"}
