{"text":"This place is great for a quick lunch or a good coffee.  Place your order at the till and they bring out your food fresh and hot.  The Mac and Cheese was one of the best I've ever had and the sandwiches are made with all fresh ingrediants,  served with a pickle and carrot on the side. Nice homey feel and a cute shaded patio.  Also in a great location across for MEC."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee - you can choose a few different beans for your drink. I buy the 49th Parallel to take home. Great baking too - everything is done on premisis"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good coffee and great tasting food, definitely visit Bumpy's.  This cafe is super cute - painted in colourful splashes of yellows and blues...not to mention the super happy/helpful staff, it's bound to make anyone's day upon setting foot inside.  As cute and quaint as this place is, keep it mind it can get horrendously busy thanks to the downtown rush, not to mention many dedicated customers.  Lengthy lineups and complications to get a table may be met, depending on the time you're visiting Bumpy's.  Everything from their food, to the lattes, and coffee is beyond amazing.  I've had breakfast at Bumpy's a few times where I've had their frittata, oatmeal, and breakfast panini accompanied with a cup of coffee and every time has been excellent.  I would sometimes get to the point I would \"forget\" to pack a lunch as an excuse to visit Bumpys during lunch hour!  I usually say \"if you're in the area check the place out\"...however for Bumpy's, if given the opportunity take the trip down for a great cup of coffee or snack depending on what is tickling your fancy!"}
{"text":"My friend Amy raved about Bumpy's Cafe to me years ago and how good the baked goods were. So I go to Bumpy's and ordered a soup and sandwich. Makes no sense, but it wouldn't be the first time that I would be accused of doing something that doesn't make sense. I was there at about 2:00 pm on a Saturday afternoon. Bumpy's is everything a little cafe should be. Nice atmosphere, artsy looking people working there, small and quaint, etc...  I asked the guy working there what panini he suggested and we decided upon the Rueben. It was pretty good. I ordered the half panini combo, which came with a cup of soup, and a choice of coleslaw or potato chips. I picked the carrot ginger soup (I'll soon be posting a stellar reciped for roasted carrot ginger soup). The soup was good but might have had a pinch too much ginger in it for my liking. I went with the coleslaw instead of the chips, because it looked appetizing, and it was.  Bumpy's was voted best espresso in Calgary, and from sitting down watching people come and go as I ate the meal, it really is about the coffee, so I'm thinking I have to go back for a coffee and a muffin next time. With a bottle of lemonade, the total cost for lunch was $10.75."}
{"text":"I had the apricot chicken panini and have to say the bread was really good and there was lots of Brie, it has promise but I feel like when you charge 8.5 for a sandwich real chicken should be used. The chicken was the per cooked strips and was really dark leading me to believe it isn't even very high quality pre cooked chicken. I pick it all off as I can't stand the texture of that stuff and it just looked gross. Otherwise the cheesy panini bread and tomato soup were really good! I would go back and maybe try a sandwich without chicken on it and definitely need to try a muffin!"}
{"text":"I had the oatmeal which doesn't sound very exciting but it was lovely to have so many choices of toppings. Best selection I've seen. I like the retro feel of the small cafe."}
{"text":"A locally owned coffee shop with the friendliest staff in town, and a perfectly eclectic menu. No pretenses in the decor, and breakfast sandwiches are served on old fashioned white bread. Good espresso-based beverages, and a huge selection of toppings for your oatmeal. About ten tables or so of friends and families enjoying subdued conversation while charging their batteries with coffee. A patio on the north side of the building gets early morning direct sun for those that need an extra boost!"}
{"text":"The place is cozy and delicate.They provide different kinds of coffee,cookies, breakfast and lunch. If you just pass by the street, you can into there to enjoy moment. That is great"}
{"text":"Muffins are WOW! Cozy homey ambiance. The people are friendly, cute patio. Didn't like their soups though... tried ginger carrot and mushroom soup - can be better!"}
{"text":"Terrific place for lunch!  Serving upscale comfort food in a retro atmosphere.  I had the ham, artichoke, pesto and  provolone panini - MmmmMmMmMmMmmmmmm.  It gets quite busy during the lunch hour but the staff is friendly and efficient so you don't have to wait very long for your food.  I will have to go back for the coffee and breakfast! Located half a block north of downtown Safeway."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary and walking from hotel for breakfast, lunch. Spotted this Gem of a cafe. Amazing cafe latte, out of this world breakfast pannini. Service was fast and staff was friendly. Def a must for a coffee and quick bite to eat. Outdoor patio was nice, quiet."}
{"text":"My first experience with Bumpy's was a few years ago when one of my coffee-snob friends from Vancouver was in town and wanted to check the place out.  I was not dissapointed. The drinks we got (trad cap, espresso, latte, chai latte) were all well made, delicious, and well presented. They definitely love the art of coffee there and it shows. Their chai latte is the best I have ever had. They use real loose leaf chai in the preparation (not that gross syrup you can get elsewhere). The end result is to die for!  I have been back a few times, but not as many times as I like. They have limited hours (till 5pm) and I don't work downtown. The only time I can ever go is on the weekend and I have seen lineups out the door. Unfortunately I am usually busy with errands so I have balked at the line a few times.  The muffins are out of hand (as my friend Bren would say) and the Paninis have always been tasty.  Their hours of operation and my inibility to enjoy their coffee as often as I would like are the only reason why I have given them 4 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"The staff and freshly baked goods are certainly a good reason to visit Bumpy's any day of the week. I had the pleasure of devouring one of their raspberry pecan muffins.  \"Feel at Home\" is Bumpy's Cafe's motto. Yet, somehow, the cafe space does not allow for that, at least not for writers, since there are no visible outlets. Bumpy's has Wi-Fi for both staff and patrons. I had to ask the staff for the Wi-Fi password as it does not appear to be posted anywhere. Frequent visitors of the cafe will know the trials of ensuring to spell the name of the berry correctly and remember the number to be added at the end.  After ordering my latte with a flavour shot of hazelnut, I settled into a small two-person table closest to the second floor entrance. Unfortunately, the spot I chose is not sustainable for long periods of laptop writing as the bench does not allow one to sit back.  If you want to work and stay a while, just be sure your computer has a full battery charge or stick to a pen and notebook. And be mindful that the washrooms are for patrons only so you need to ask the staff for the washroom key."}
{"text":"Try their mac & cheese. Great coffee & muffins too! Great for an early start downtown. Don't forget your book or newspaper...non-peak hours it is a relaxing place. Busy in mornings & at lunch!"}
{"text":"The best almond milk latte in the city...and their fresh baked muffins are delicious. The patio is pretty awesome as well. Check-it-out."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best latte in town.   Not only are the baristas friendly, the food lovingly made fresh every day by a woman who I can only assume is everyone's grandmother, and the coffee excellent, but they put little pictures of ferns in your latte foam! (I'm a sucker for little pictures in my latte foam).  The gourmet gruyere macaroni & cheese and homemade peach and almond muffins aren't half bad either on a cold winter day.  The staff knows their regulars and those people are regular for a reason. The place is a cute little hole-in-the-wall popular with all the suits this side of 9th Ave who come to have coffee with a barista who remembers their name and their order when they walk in.  T."}
{"text":"mmmm great muffins and coffee! Try the Mac and cheese too :D"}
{"text":"They have awesome coffee. I had a large latte, it was delicious and I was very happily caffeinated. Their offerings for breakfast and lunch are tasty and affordable. The staff was friendly.  It is downtown so going on a Sunday will make parking easier. It was a very cold day when I went the first time and was near the door that kept letting cold air in. I have returned many times and have fallen in-love with this place. Hands down, their coffee and muffins are the best!"}
{"text":"Although Bumpy's is very expensive, it's a great place! They have a great selections of drinks and meals to try, and the place has a nice atmosphere. The employees were also very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this.  The drinks are good, as well. I tried the Chai Latte."}
{"text":"If you've ever worked downtown Calgary, then chances are you've not only heard of Bumpy's Cafe, but you've made frequent visits.   Known as being the 'busy spot' for the downtown office crowd, Bumpy's Cafe serves up signature paninis, homemade soups and oatmeal, along with a variety of other menu options. Also known for serving up one of the city's best cappuccinos, Bumpy's is pretty much always bumpin'.  The staff is wonderfully friendly and the decor is cheerful. Prices are reasonable and the coffee is darn right delicious."}
{"text":"Closed on Sunday.  The sign on the door says open. The voice mail message says it's open.  It is locked tight, dark and closed.  As we were pondering our next move a guy walks by and says this happens all the time.  After the third time he never tried again.  First and last for us."}
{"text":"Almond milk...freshly baked muffins...gluten-free offerings...Muffeletaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! My brain just about overloaded when it saw all of these delights under one roof. Add the retro decor, the antiqued metal tables and...whaaaat??!!?? I get the \"Dukes of Hazzard\" sign on my table for my order? This place is a dream come true.   I ordered an almond milk hot chocolate to start. So delicious and not too sweet. Plus, I love the corrugated cardboard cups that save your hands from hot drinks without needing a sleeve. Got a beautiful chocolate chip walnut muffin for my little monkey. That will be a great after school treat for her today!  The Muffeleta - mmmm...very tasty. Put olive tapenade on just about anything and I'll be a happy girl, but add some provolone, Italian meats and toast it all together? That's a happiness sandwich!   Then there's the freshly baked lemon yogurt loaf. This sucker is old-school...moist, glazed to perfection and served in a SLAB, not a slice.  There are so many other things to try here that I just have to come back. Let's not forget about the cheery service, and how helpful everyone is here. Bumpy's, you've stolen my heart!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bumpy's for breakfast more times than I can remember and I go specifically for the quiche. It is incredible. My two favorites are the ham & cheese and the vegatable. I always get the side of yogurt with it and whatever fresh muffins they have for the day. The flavors change frequently and I haven't tried one yet that wasn't delicous. It gets busy on the weekends so make sure you go early enough because they do occassionally run out of food."}
{"text":"It's a cozy little cafe....I dig this place.    My coworkers and I love going to Bumpy's for coffee, it's a little treat for ourselves.  They have variety of freshly baked muffins and hot yummy lattes.  I love their scones...they are just so yummy.....whenever I see their scones, I have to get it.  I just can't resist!  Also if you are a tea-drinker, you have to try their tea!  It's so good.  They use actual tea leaves and not tea bags!!!  My personal favorite is their Jasmine Green Tea.  It's so refreshing.    Love their services too.  The staffs are friendly and always have a big smile on their face.    Thumbs up for Bumpy's!"}
{"text":"Best latte in Calgary!  And the BLT egg bagel sammy was on point too.  Just what was needed driving from Banff to Glacier.  Can't wait to sip the Atomic Blend in our French press tomorrow morning @ the campsite.  Thanks Bumpy's & to the girl @ MEC who recommended this coffee stop!"}
{"text":"I used to work nearby, so I went almost every morning. Bumpy's has great coffee that basically ruined coffee in most other places for me. It's my crack. Everyone there is always warm and friendly, right down to the girl that used to cheerfully point out on frozen days that my glasses had fogged and my mascara was running :) It saved me from talking to customers later looking like I had been crying from bad food.  If they started offering almond milk as well as soy milk as a dairy alternative (too much soy milk makes my tummy hurt), I'd probably never leave."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I have for giving Bumpy's four stars is because the only thing I've had there is the chai latte (more later). I'm considering that extra star motivation to go and try the rest of the menu.  As for the chai latte (soy for me!), it is by far THE BEST I've ever had in this city. And I love Indian food and have an amazing Indian roommate who loves to cook. It's brewed fresh every time with the correct spices, steeped just long enough so when it's strained into your coffee cup/mug, it is literally the perfect temperature to chug down. And chug it down you will, it's so smooth. 5 minutes later you're wondering when you can get your next fix.   I've heard the oatmeal is amazing, also made fresh. Big ups to the barista rocking the Stussy shirt."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee here!  I had the spinach mushroom quiche which was also excellent.  Staff is very friendly and service is prompt.  This is especially impressive considering how busy they are.  If the place were bigger I'd give it a five star rating in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Best Soy Latte in town.  Also their OMG Muffin is amazing, can someone message me when they next have them because I keep missing them! :D  I only wish I lived closer so I could go ever weekend."}
{"text":"Bumpy's does a great drip coffee using their own Bumpy's blend of beans. Their muffins are awesome, and if you can get a seat to have your coffee to stay, it's a great 20 minute relaxing moment in the day. Also a good place for a one-on-one, conversation, but not for large groups. They also have a small patio  to sit out on, which is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I worked near by. They have the best quiche I've ever had, and that includes my Mom's. they also have a weird apple cheddar muffin, and it's amazing! The service is excellent, that staff always look genuinely happy to see you when you walk in. Go, try this place! It's a cozy comfy place to eat and their coffee is great too!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is amazing - their jalapeño/bacon quiche is crazy good.  The people are friendly and efficient.  They even have a super cute patio.  Definitely worth a stop :)"}
{"text":"The coffee is great, the muffins are *awesome* (and I don't even like muffins!), and the lovely lady who takes my dollars is always so happy and uppity and friendly!"}
{"text":"You're just so darned cute, Bumpy's! You're hip, you're happening, you keep up with the cool kids, and yet I still want to introduce you to my grandma. You're fun and funky and still so down-home adorable.  Your staff are bubbly and wonderful all the time! They're so nice, I feel like I need to be on my best behavior at all times. Sometime I visit you in the morning and I make sure to thank them on the way out after I've had my coffee and can finally interact with them like the real human being that I am post-coffee.  You can be kind of hard to get around in and when you're busy I wind up bumping into everyone sitting down... bump bump bump...wait a minute... Did I just figure it out your name? Its ok by me though, your narrow in the middle design makes it difficult to pass by people, but I think it just adds to your quirky charm.  Last visit I had some borderline life-changing cream of mushroom soup. Nothing different, nothing unexpected, just really really good cream of mushroom soup - flavourful broth with impressive full slices of mushroom everywhere. It's a good thing I was meeting someone, or I would have had my face buried in that bowl with soup up to my ears!   Home-made and heavenly."}
{"text":"Found myself at the doors of M.E.C. about an hour earlier than I intended, (and an hour before they open)....  A fella cleaning the window said, \"If you want a coffee while you wait, Bumpy's is just around the corner.\"  I dragged my sleepy ass around the corner to Bumpy's where I was greeted by possibly the most friendly, joyful young lady on the planet!  I felt like I should have given her a hug like a long missed friend.  She recommended the sausage and egg bread pudding, which I will now heartily recommend to you!   It is savoury and cheesy and all together a wonderful surprise find on a chill morning!"}
{"text":"Visited for brunch. More like lunch. But a really late lunch, so they were actually out of a lot of dishes.   There's street parking nearby but I'm unsure if there is designated parking for the cafe.   The place is real cute and hip. It just feels like a place you are guaranteed to get a good drink. There are tons of options and I decided on the matcha with almond milk (thanks for having this option)! Just so you know, their matcha latte is UNSWEETENED, like zero taste of sweetness so if you are not a fan of straight up matcha, keep this in mind.   We were starving so we had the jalapeño bacon mac n cheese which was the special, lasagna, and breakfast blt. All the entrees (I assume) come with a side of a carrot and hot pepper - yes singular carrot - see picture. I thought this was so odd. Would be better off maybe serving with a handful of chips instead?   If you are staying, they give you a witty sign instead of a number and bring the food out to you. The areas are a bit divided but there is a variety of seating available.   Everything was good but nothing was amazing and jumped out at me.. Or even stuck in my mind. Most of the food tasted very homey - but also made me feel like I could make it myself at home.   Seems like there are a lot of raving reviews for their baked goods so perhaps I'll try that next time. I'll visit again for a cup of coffee and baked goodies, but I'll go elsewhere for a solid meal."}
{"text":"An efficient production, and necessarily so considering how busy it gets around lunch hour. I've stopped by a few  times during off peak hours, usually I've have stayed longer than I had planned. Calgary has many \"get-your-coffee-and-go\" cafes, mostly because many Calgarians want such service. Bumpy's caters to this crowd. But Bumpy's is also a cafe in a more traditional sense.   Order a coffee, light snack, have a seat and relax for a bit. Very friendly and cheerful staff. Pleasant decor. Free wireless. Amazing beet chocolate cake. I'm not a coffee expert, but their espresso was very tasty.  There are a couple things that bother me though. First, although usually they play cool custom music playlists, on some days for music they simply play a commercial radio station. This does not help the ambiance, especially when there are commercials blasting. Second, although I stand behind their beet chocolate cake (which they don't have everyday) the rest of their main courses are quite average.   Prices are reasonable, but not cheap by any means. Reasonable."}
{"text":"The coffee is really good here. Everybody knows this. As of writing this there's a person named Claire that works there. She is the friendliest person I have ever met in the morning. Claire has made a point of remembering my name and always greets me warmly."}
{"text":"3 - STARS. If you desire a fancy drink and a snack, this is the place for you. For the privilege, that drink and snack will set you back about $10 to $12 bucks. The space is funky, cramped but somewhat comfortable, the help is helpful, the menu is diverse enough for most who want a drink and a snack. If you are looking for a meal, you will likely leave disappointed. If you rise from bed on a Saturday and head out the door for breakfast, you will also likely be disappointed; there simply is no hearty, fill-er-up, full breakfast items on the menu to be had.  I went with a friend and at the end of the experience went looking for breakfast - somewhere else. True story. All in all, a fun little place but not for real eats. For real eats, head to Red's or a fun little place on 11 street between 14th and 15th. Come for the coffee and a small bite to eat with a good friend. That is what Bumpy's is all about. Breakfast - no. 4 or 5 star? Only if this is your idea of cozy cool. You decide."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop.  Not the largest food menu - so don't go for the food, but if you want a snack with your coffee THIS is your place.  The people here are very friendly and helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"I loved the minimalistic decor with a nice retro vibe to it. The staff was really friendly and helped me decide when I would do it at my own. Their was music in the background but it wasn't noisy, and allowed one to have a conversation. The food portion was slightly smaller, but it tasted was good."}
{"text":"Ein sehr schönes kleines originelles Cafe mit sehr nettem Personal. Die Gerichte sind house-made und liebevoll angerichtet. Die Preise sind sehr angenehm."}
{"text":"Bumpy's is right around the corner from my office, and I love it.  The coffee is amazing (we only buy our beans from Bumpy's now... I've totally been spoiled).  The service is amazing, the fresh muffins are amazing.  I've only had 1 or two of the lunch items, and they are great.  The staff are consistently awesome as we.  Important to note: the coffees are amazing, but are less of a production line than more big coffee chains, so be prepared to wait a bit.    It also gets nutso busy in the morning - so don't go if you are in a big rush."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is very urban/artistic yuppy where one can get some good coffees, lattes and teas, my experience there was less than favourable and I will NEVER go back there again.  I recently moved to Calgary. Was looking for a funky acletic cafe for something different and unique.  Read the reviews here and figured this was the place to go to. I ordered lunch - paid $15 for small 5oz soup and a Muffaletta sandwhich.  A Muffaletta sandwhich is supposed to come with several different Italian lunch meats and is a rather large sandwhich, which is why I didn't hesitate to pay the $8 they charged for it.  When I got my sandwhich, it wasn't at all what it was supposed to be.  It was a tiny grilled ham sandwhich, cut in half.  As I bite into it, I got melted into the cheese a LONG BLOND HAIR. (I have short dark curly hair... definitely wasn't mine)   When I brought it up to counter - they shrugged it off as no big deal.  Instead of offering me another sandwhich or a refund, they offered me a muffin. Sorry!  The soup was supposed to be Butternut Squash but it tasted more like sweetened corn starch.    Maybe they should just stick to serving coffees, teas and lattes and leave the food to real chefs and restaurants... and learn a thing or two about customer service when someone comes up to you with a VERY long blond hair in their sandwhich.  You should be mortified and make your team wear hair nets.  And no.  A muffin is NOT the right thing to offer in return."}
{"text":"Bumpy's is a pretty awesome little cafe. It's a little hard to spot the first time (about a half block south of 10th Ave on 8th St, after the alley) but once you know it's there you just want to keep going back.  Their muffins are phenomenal, and they have flavours you'd never see anywhere else. Forget boring blueberry or carrot bran - they combine all these ingredients such that you have a tough time picking just one.  The coffee is yummy! I've never had one that I didn't like. I'm generally a latte person and an indication of a good one is that I don't have to add sugar - no sugar here! They also sell JJ Bean coffee, in case you've gotten addicted to it while in Vancouver.  I've had one of their breakfast paninis and it was also yummy. Some of their soups and specials sound amazing but I'm usually only dropping by for a coffee. Would like to stop and have lunch there someday.   Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"If you're an oatmeal lover like me, you'll love this place. There is an extensive list of toppings on a blackboard to pick from. Great oatmeal. I had to get one of their muffin tops, as well. I don't know her name, but if you get the black-haired skinny girl with short hair working behind the counter you'll have no option but to have a smile on your face. She's super nice and super bubbly."}
{"text":"What a find! Where do you go at 7am in the downtown core for breakfast? Go to Bumpy's! The lovely patio belies its central location, and just draws you in. The good old fashioned rock and roll 50's diner ambiance just puts you at ease.  Friendly staff, great breakfast bagels. Gotta come here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bumpy's for a while and the service that I had has been excellent.  I love their smoothies as well. I remember one time I had an  appointment down town and I walked right by Bumpy's and i decided to get lunch.  I usually get Breakfast here so when it came to lunch i wasn't really sure what was good and what wasn't   I remember asking the lady at the counter what was good and I took her recommendation for lunch I can't recall what it was but it was incredibly good. Something else that struck me about this occasion was when I ordered my smoothie  . The first smoothie that caught my eye was a tropical one and I decided to order it however I was not sure if it had passion fruit in it or not (for some reason I am quite weird and have never really liked passion fruit.) the women serving me actually took the juice out of the fridge to make sure it didn't have any passion fruit in it before she made it up for me.  I have never experienced service that good anywhere before.  There coffee's are also delicious  I don't think I have ever had a bad cup of coffee.  Something else I have noticed is they never mess up my order most places i go to I have had the odd thing wrong with my order and when i come here i generally order quite a bit.   I love Bumpy's I do believe that it is the best coffee shop in Calgary"}
{"text":"So, I had heard that Bumpy's had some of the greatest coffee in Calgary, and I'm glad to FINALLY confirm that that is so. It is the greatest little cafe, and I'm very excited to go back for lunch and to try the rest of the menu.  I had their plain coffee (no espresso yet), but it was full and flavourful and delicious, and out-tasted a lot of brews I've have at home. It was a fairly traded roast, which is just another added bonus.  The staff were super-friendly, but there was a pretty big line up."}
{"text":"Second visit at Bumpy's is even better than my first. Why? Their lattes are out of this world GOOD!!!  After checking out 8 of the top 10 coffee shops in Calgary, this latte may have won the number one place in my heart.. :)  Had the mac and cheese again and still SOOOO GOOOD!!"}
{"text":"The lattes are so delicious because they absorb the karmic radiance of the employees via some divine osmotic process. (I have never been to a cafe with such warm, happy, helpful barristas).  Decided to check it out after our lunch today because of the reviews here on Yelp.  Definitely did not disappoint.   Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Bumpy's was voted the top coffee in Calgary for a number of years for a reason.  I always get the Vietnamese Latte when I'm here.  The coffee is always consistent and the staff is always very welcoming and helpful.  It's a hidden gem. I haven't tried the mac and cheese but a lot of people rave about it."}
{"text":"Bumpy's is the first place in Calgary where I've been able to find Vancouver's JJ Bean coffee. And hoo-boy it was a potent cup of joe.  There's a wonderfully peppy, high energy gal who works there. In the mornings when I'm still half asleep, it's almost too much to handle but I appreciate her efforts to make the morning a little less groggy."}
{"text":"Perfect for a Sunday morning coffee and light breakfast in Calgary.  The reviewers were right about the muffins.  Calgary is a very walkable city."}
{"text":"Alright, I know my last review for Bumpy's was a 5-star, but it just got better.   Bumpy's has renovated, and with the renovations come a much improved coffee rush line. It's true, there is reduced seating capacity (Bumpy's wasn't all that big to begin with), but now there is a much smoother process for getting your cuppa joe in the morning.  Before, the lineup became mixed up with people waiting for their coffees or others trying to get to the cream and sugar station. This area has been opened up and the cream and sugar station moved to the other side of the til. Now, you can walk in, get your coffee and continue on in the same direction.  Same amazing muffins (my recommendation for today is the chocolate chip walnut) and same super cheery service."}
{"text":"The greeting from one of the staff members is something I won't forget in a while. The energy and positive vibes complemented the awesome food at this place."}
{"text":"Firstly, I love the renovations, and how I no longer have to risk spilling my coffee all over someone while bumping elbows trying to get to my seat at Bumpy's. I am also a huge fan of the patio, and when it is not too hot and I can catch a breeze (I do everything in my power to avoid the sun, I hate Calgary summers), I enjoy sipping out here.  Bumpy's coffee and lattes are pretty fantastic. I have also sipped a few of their teas. I generally don't drink green teas at busy coffee shops as I know the leaves will likely end up burnt, so I've sampled an herbal variety, and their Earl Grey. Loose leaf rules. Their iced \"chai\" (I look forward to the day when everyone stops throwing masala spiced tea under the generic name of chai, which if we weren't in North America, could mean ANY kind of tea) is decent as well.  Something I am going to gripe about at Bumpy's, is not their obvious lack of  vegan friendly options, although it would be nice if they had a vegetarian soup, or a muffin (even if it tasted like crap and contained applesauce, my big baking no no). They have one vegetarian panini, with tofu. The most poorly prepared tofu I have ever have. Even now, I can taste the awful in my mouth. I was sorely disappointed when a friend took me here for lunch and I tried this. What I would recommend to Bumpy's, is learn to cook tofu, or don't even try at all. This is one of the few places where I would just rather not have the option at all. This, for me, is enough to remove one star. I also agree with Tiffany about the soy vs. almond milk. However, Bumpy's serves up excellent coffee and beverages otherwise, and would definitely recommend a quick stop if you're downtown, or taking advantage of their patio before it gets too cold."}
{"text":"You walk into Bumpy's around 8:30, you see the line-up of about 1204 people, and your first instinct is to walk away. Resist the urge! This is the place where on-duty cops and paramedics come for a quick pick-me-up. So you know the coffee is strong, good, and relatively cheap. Plus, after your second visit, everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"The best coffee in the city, plus the baked goods! Amazing! Good luck leaving without a yummy treat and an amazing coffee!"}
{"text":"Another review haiku!  Cheerful place, nice staff Great breakfast or lunch options Muffins to die for  15/30"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, friendly staff, great cheap prices and quality food! Only been here once and I ordered the cafe mocha and I felt like I died and went to heaven. It was so rich and decadent. And the breakfast panini was really fulfilling.   I can't wait to come back here for breakfast, I'd drive 30 mins every morning just to have breakfast if I could wake up early enough!"}
{"text":"Really good food!! I always see a line on Sundays for brunch in this place and now I really know why... It is delicious!! I had the lasagna and it was great ! The sandwich of my partner looked delicious too and he said it was very good... The coffee was great too!! Although the place is small I think is worthy to go there any day with no waiting line... I definitely would like to go back there to try the rest of items they offer!!"}
{"text":"I went back to Bumpy's Cafe today and have to say: the latte probably had the best foam I've ever tasted.  Yes, better than Uptown Espresso in Seattle.  Good enough to bump my previous rating of 3 up to 5 stars.  As for the crappy drink they served my wife last time we were there, she should have had a latte!"}
{"text":"Ordered on Uber Eats. The scone had soggy dough in the center. The bagels were soggy as well and one item wasnt even delivered from the order.  Tip: if you order on Uber eats, give them a call to confirm they got all the items from your order."}
{"text":"I love this place. The cafe' decor has a 50's / 60's retro look / feel in an old brick building.   The most deliciously creamy & consistent Latte's in Calgary. They use JJ bean coffee (roasted in Vancouver)   The food & baking is delicious, reasonably priced and all made in house.   The staff: You won't find a friendlier lot!   This is my first 5 Star review. I've been coming here for over a year so this is based on many, many visits."}
{"text":"Okay, this review is long overdue. Why? Because Bumpy's has long been my favourite coffee shop in all of Calgary!  There is SO much I love about Bumpy's. Too much! This review could go on for days! But let me sum up ...  All around, Bumpy's is the undisputed king (or queen) of all coffee shops in my book. -The interior is so fun, colourful and adorably kitschy. -The food is delicious and comforting -The staff is friendly, funny and helpful (not at ALL snobs, like you may experience in SOME OTHER coffee shops in town) -The espresso ... oh the espresso ... maybe not THE best in town, but certainly tied, or up there with the best, and oh so unique ... an almost \"toasty\" quality to it!  Bumpy's is so great.  While I am not OFTEN in the Beltline, any time I can find an excuse to visit Bumpy's, I am more than happy to comply. I love it."}
{"text":"What a great place.  The staff was so energetic and nice. The place was SPOTLESS and I know clean as I have a commercial cleaning business and the food was super tasty. The cheese tasted like it dropped from heaven and the temperature was perfect. Going back soon!!"}
{"text":"What has happened to Bumpy's??!! We used to love this place but today I think they steped into the twilight zone. The women behind the cash was so loud and completely annoying!! She was SO fake it was all I could do to finish another bite. The soup was cold and the chilli was luke warm, the pannini wasn't cooked enough, does warm bread say enough. Totally disappointed for a place I USED to love. :o("}
{"text":"I need to stop neglecting you Bumpy's! Whenever my friend is back in town visiting from Montreal, she demands we go to Bumpy's. She came back, demanded, so we went!  I love how welcoming this joint is, very cozy and friendly staff, the perfect cure to a drizzly day. We are greeted with smiles and given a Fantasy Island table topper to flag our orders down with.  I enjoyed a delicious Vietnamese latte, pineapple raspberry muffin and a bacon, caramelized onion panini. I never felt rushed to leave or like I was out of place. I didn't feel like I need a cool factor of 10 like Beano to enjoy great service and courtesy from the staff, though obviously my cool factor is always at a 12.  I did live in fear slightly while enjoying our food as I had parked in the Bonterra lot, and was hoping my car would still be there when I returned.  Next time, I will park where I am supposed to and Bumpy's, we must make a permanent arrangement for meetups."}
{"text":"I came in here quickly for a chai tea latte, but boy it sure was memorable. Great chai taste, and real handcrafted quality.  My new benchmark for chai."}
{"text":"Come for the coffee. Stay for the smiles, ambiance, and chill music. I'll be back. The breakfast bagel was mediocre, but the oatmeal with brown sugar, strawberries and bananas was divine. And the chai latte was exceptional."}
