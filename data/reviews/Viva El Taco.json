{"text":"Our steak burrito was soupy and couldn't finish it because it tasted so bad. The chicken tacos were very small and the shells were very hard. The chicken was dry and no flavor. We were charged an extra 50 cents for using a card which is fine, if we were told about the extra charge. We gave two stars because the man behind the register was nice otherwise we would have given one star. We will not return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. Came here for breakfast and had the machaca plate and my hubby the carnitas burrito. The food was delicious and authentic. The salsa bar was fantastic. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. The people were especially nice and attentive."}
{"text":"My Husband and I usually go for their carne asada fries! Mainly when we are drunk or craving something super greasy. They are good but sometimes the fries are undercooked. The service is not the best. The location itself is a little scary there is usually a lot of bums hanging out around there and the place looks run down.. I needs a little fixer upper!"}
{"text":"We're still going here all the time. It's so good. The rolled tacos are addicting, this had nothing to do with my pregnancy, I'm still addicted. The staff very nice & the place is clean. It's nice going to a place that actually smiles & talks to you."}
{"text":"Avoid unless you dont mind non-existent customer service.  Food is usually fresh and tasty, get takeout here frequently, mainly due to location near house. However, customer service is non-existant. No one ever smiles or greets you. Twice an item was left out of order. When I mentioned it during my next order (in person) I was treated very rudely. I never complain unless something is really an issue, and I thought this deserved it. I work in customer service/hospitality and this is what will kill a business. Learn how to treat loyal customers better. I will be finding a new place to eat :( ps: maybe it was karma (I hate to complain because I am afraid of this -  complain before ordering and you probably won't get the \"cleanest\" food), maybe it was the food, but it was the first time I got sick after eating there, too :("}
{"text":"If you go to this taco shop its because you live way up here and it's the only one up here lol and it's pretty good especially late at night since its open 24 Hours I always get the rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese makes me want some more !!!"}
{"text":"This is the first review I've ever written. I don't go out of my way to review places because I just don't care. This place however is something else. First the dining room is dirty and about half of the few tables had food scraps on them. The cashier, while nice seemed annoyed. I wondered why at first until I saw that part of her duties were to babysit the two retards at the grill. I apologize for the use of the word retard as I'm sure it is an insult to the mentally handicapped to be compared to these two ass clowns as they threw food around. Anyway, I ordered a carnitas taco and a burrito al pastor. I took a bite into the taco and all I tasted was rancid pork fat. I moved on to the burrito against my better judgement and all I could taste was salt. As I type I can already feel the bout of dysentery approaching."}
{"text":"Shuttling between old apartment and my new place here in Sunrise, we had to have breakfast takeaway, and I was pleased.  Delicious. The breakfast burrito was all the fuel I needed for a day of packing and moving. Now that we are solid residents and I have tried other Mexican eateries in the area, I must say, the quality of the cooked meats is levels above the other guys. The carne asada burrito my husband had was made well and I was happy to see that the carnitas in mine was still recognizable as pork. I abhor meat cooked or charred to a tasteless jerky.  I also love that the condiment bar was kept well. The pickled onions are AMAZING and carrots are a necessary accompaniment."}
{"text":"The best nachos in Vegas. Ask for extra pico de gallo and be sure and use their red hot sauce LIBERALLY!"}
{"text":"I returned and they redeemed themselves!!! More impressive since it was a late night visit... My Chicken taco was fresh and juicy like I'm used too!!! KEEP IT UP!!!"}
{"text":"Was so happy that they were opened. The asada burrito I ordered was just right, with the cheese, rice, beans and salsa added. The burrito was a good size and was enough to save for a later snack if you couldnt finish it."}
{"text":"Only giving this one star because I have to buy it definitely doesn't deserve one. If you have ever had food from any of the other Viva el tacos you would know how delicious their food is, but this location unfortunately has much lower standards. Food quality is horrible. The carne asada meat they use is disgusting and full of fat. Also they charge extra for drinks, unlike the other locations. On my order specifically I asked for no Pico De Gallo on my carne asada fries and instead of making me new fries like they should they picked out the pieces in the one they first gave me. Truly such a nasty experience. Hopefully you get the chance to try out one of the other locations because this one is horrible."}
{"text":"I've lived many places that have great mexican food and this place is worse than a taco truck. The lady that helped me didn't speak English so it was very difficult to order and then get my order. I ordered 2 rolled taco specials and told them I didn't want the drinks that came with the combos I wanted to pay for 2 large horchatas. When it came time to pick up she said there was no more horchata, and I pointed at the machine and said there it is right there. She gave me 1 horchata and gave me a small cup and a dollar. WTF? I live 2 min walking distance fr this hole. Never going back."}
{"text":"It is not real mexican food but it is fresh and the staff is friendly...plus staff is willing to make the food any way you want. Robertos is more authenic...but atleast the staff is friendly and food is fresh"}
{"text":"best bean and cheese burritos.  love the chicken tacos (hard shell)"}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fast food joint.  Like the prices, my favorite thing about the place is that it is clean.  Lots of variety on the menu.  Always served hot.  Just had breakfast burrito, delicious.  Big breakfast menu! ( I always forget to take pictures because I'm Hungry )"}
{"text":"Nasty as hell!! Was waiting for my food watching it get made when one of the workers comes from outside somewhere walks behind the counter and starts making my food without washing his hands!! If you don't want to get sick is stay away from here"}
{"text":"Good but not great - could be a little more authentic. Missing california mexican food"}
{"text":"As a real Mexican I can assure everyone that this place is not all great the meat is dry and honestly I found no taste in the tacos. I wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"Best carne asada fries and sopes. I live this place and I come here all the time with my family. I will keep coming here. Thanks for the awesome service"}
{"text":"Went to Mama Maria's down the street and they lock the doors 20 minutes before they were supposed to close so I went up to Viva El taco and got Carne Asada fries I was completely satisfied they were great"}
{"text":"The food is not terrible it's pretty good. Just the service isn't that great. And my order was not right. But like I said the food wasn't that bad that's why I gave three stars. The wasting area was also pretty clean along with the counter with salsa, lines etc.. I came to visit a friend near here and stop by to try it for the first time. I asked for a refill on drink and was given a eye role. And asked for extra napkins and they made it seem like it bother them that I asked. But other then that it was somewhat clean and the food was ok."}
{"text":"The cashier was very confused with our order  she was trying to tell us that the prices we were looking at on the menu were not the prices and on Yelp the prices are way lower than the prices in the actual restaurant. We came here a couple months ago and the service was way better and the cashier was not so confused. For example bean tostada is $2.50 and the french fries are $2.50. And I'm not sure why they have a B from the health department."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place great service and great food. We came here with our service dog and had no problem. Sometimes spanish places are not aware of the service dog laws and give us a hard time with our dog. The cashier was super friendly and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The food is good but every time my wife orders extra wet she never gets it! They also forgot her churro last time and when I returned the cook called me a liar and said we didn't order it. Cashier had pulled up my order receipt to prove it. We use to order twice a week. They no longer have our business. The cashier also put her arm up to her elbow in the horchata. Gross!!!!! No more Viva for us!"}
{"text":"The chicken torta was great moist flavorful chicken and a perfect roll soft but substantial. The fish tacos were fried fish. Normally not my favorite,  however, the batter was well seasoned and crispy and there was no over powering fish taste to the meat just the way a good fish taco should taste. I look forward to my next trip to see these guys."}
{"text":"Worst guacamole EVER.  It was thin & watery.  The chips (that weren't completely cooked) were soggy.  The refried beans were too salty & the Spanish Rice was just OK"}
{"text":"The good here was OKAY. I had gone to a really authentic Mexican style restaurant called \"Taco Bell\" a few days before and was using that experience as a barometer. They had several different levels of spicy sauces and a lot of menu options. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"If you like true Mexican food, this is the place to go to. The variety of food choices at this place is crazy, and I have something new to try every time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Muy buenos camaradas, el servicio es pronto y tienen buen sazon.  Me encantan los taquitos  dorados de la especial del miercoles aunque a veces el chef me los apachurra! jaja pero en si, buen lugar para una comida rica y rapida!  Animo muchachos!"}
{"text":"I love this Mexican place and find it much better than Roberto's. It is independently owned, and the service is quick and friendly.    I lived in San Diego for many years and know good Mexican fast food. This place is about the best I've had in Las Vegas. Their carne asada is very good and seems to be from a higher quality cut of meat. What I love most about this place is their fresh salsa! It is not watered down like Robertos; it is thick and tasty! They have a few different varieties to choose from, and all are very good.    I'm also a fan of the carne asada chips!"}
{"text":"We love the food, have never had anything that was not good. We come back every time we are in town. Friendly people with awesome food. They have a huge menu to choose from and late hours for those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when we are in town. I love the fresh condiment bar with the spicey carrots. My husband likes the hard shell chicken tacos. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Real Mexican Fast Food! It was really good but still not as good as Plaza Mexico in Eastpointe, Michigan. I got a burrito and rice. The people were nice. I bought 4 25 cent mustaches from the toy coin machine. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. This is just your run of the mill mexican joint nothing to special. My biggest complaint no Dr. Pepper.. are you kidding... DP is the most important thing to have at a mexican food place.."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I ordered the chicken California burrito with guacamole (extra). Super clean too! The size of the burrito was worth the money spent. The salsas were good as well. If you're in the mood for mexican food this place will hit the spot. I have no complaints about this place. Definitely a spot I'd come visit again."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant several times. Definitely better than Roberto's if your looking for good Mexican food that's fast. Their food is always very fresh and flavorful. This is quality Mexican food that you usually have to spend a bunch of money for. The only complaint i have is a lot of the workers can not speak English very well so they will mess up the order :( the price is decent and the food is delicious! If your looking for good Mexican food but, don't want to spend a bunch of money or don't have a lot of time i highly recommend trying this place out !"}
{"text":"Horrible...I'll never eat at this place again. I found spiders crawling around in my carne Asada fries... Disgusting"}
{"text":"For someone that's a bit picky when it comes to tacos this place was pretty good, I ordered 8 small soft taquitos de asada $1.75 each and everyone really liked them!"}
{"text":"My sister went to pick us up breakfast and ordered 2 breakfast burritos without meat and 1 breakfast burrito with bacon. All three came with bacon. My sister has been vegetarian for years and took a bite out of the burrito and needless to say is very sickened right now. The customer service seemed careless. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall taco shop on the east side, but they're open 24 hours and the food is goo, hot, fast, and relatively inexpensive.  Great place for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how I feel about this place yet. I got the chili rellenos, and didn't really care for them...they had a funny windex flavored aftertaste. My hubby really liked his carne asada burrito though. They have a pretty wide variety of things you can order, so I'm willing to give this place another try. I really liked the green salsa (lots of garlic), the red was pretty average. The prices are reasonable. My hubby's burrito was big and full of steak that he really liked. I'll post again and re-rate after I try something else from here :) So, for now it can get a middle of the road."}
{"text":"Food here is OK. It's like a Robertos. I don't usually buy dinner here 99% of the time all I buy is breakfast burritos and those are good so I give 4 stars. Staff is friendly but then again I've been here so many times they know me already. If you want some breakfast burritos I recommend it."}
{"text":"We love this place! There Burritos are stuffed with meat and protein and not fillings like most places these days. Plus there 24 hours and they cook the food in front of you. They are reasonably priced for what you get and of course food always tastes delicioso."}
{"text":"I guess this review is a little biased, because they did mess up our order-they forgot the flavor! Wow, just the most bland food I've had. I can't believe there are multiple locations. I should have known when I walked in just before 5pm, and the place was empty! 2 stars because it wasn't terrible, just bland"}
{"text":"We visited this Viva El Taco location a few days ago and ordered (1) Carnitas Plate w/ Jamaica and (1) Burrito de Lengua w/ Horchata, Pricing for the meal was as expected very affordable. I can't complain about the Carnitas Plate it was delicious and very well seasoned with very tender and juicy meat however i have a few complaints regarding the Burrito, It had too much filler which i wasn't expecting.   Every bite taken from this burrito felt as if i had been eating a bowl of rice, refried beans & guacamole - the meat was not noticeable and i suppose that's okay if you're some kind of unorthodox vegetarian but for me it was not right. I understand filler is often used to save money etc. but this burrito was almost completely made of rice/guac and refried beans.  Lastly their Horchata was very refreshing and tasty as for the Jamaica, We could tell right away by how watery it was that it wasn't natural and it had been taken from powder form or a bottle. There are many taco joints that still make their drinks natural from scratch or sometimes mixed with concentrates ie; Robertos, Mariana's, Taco Mexico etc."}
{"text":"Super Burrito Carne Asada is absolute perfection. This place is an excellent neighborhood burrito spot and I am so glad for it! The spicy carrots are top notch, rolled tacos and chicken crunchy tacos are great. Try Viva El Taco, anything this place serves up will be delicious!"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem with your food until tonight. The Carnitas in my burrito tasted horrible. The meat was bad. I am so disappointed. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"i purchase chilea rellenos, they seem to starving because they are so small and flat. and i pay a good amount for 2 of them $8 they look like they cost 5$ or less"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and service was great. The menu was easy to read. My food was cooked right and had no problems with finding the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Roberto's, but a little cheaper. I've eaten here a handful of times and have tried different things. My favorite thing here is the breakfast burritos. Bacon, eggs and fries instead of diced potatoes, yum. On my last visit I tried the chile relleno and chicken tacos, but I didn't like either. They didn't cut the seeds out of the pepper in the relleno so it was super spicy and I got a mouthful of seeds in every bite! No bueno! The chicken tacos had hardly any chicken and mostly just lettuce. I got this order to go, but if you want to dine-in there is plenty of seating and the salsa bar always looks fresh and is well stocked. The cashier is always friendly and the food comes out quick. I will probably be back for the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Some items on the menu are better then others. I love the Chimichanga and the soft tacos. The service is good and you never have to wait long. Great neighborhood joint. I prefer them over Roberto's. The prices are also very reasonable. The place is around the corner from my house...no need for me to go anywhere else. Viva Taco serves its purpose."}
{"text":"Much better then Roberto's, meat was not all grizzle. 1 free refile on Horchata, salsa's were good but nothing special.  Best fast food Mexican in town IMHO"}
{"text":"The worst Mexican place. The beef is boiled and it was disgusting. The hard tacos are soft. And the sauce smells and tastes like ammonia. Bad day for Mexican."}
{"text":"Loaded with meat! Price is right. Huge portions. They don't mess around! You won't be disappointed! Better than Baja Taco! Pepsi products takes this place to the top! Viva El Taco please viva forever!"}
{"text":"Pretty good and good prices! Great tortillas and service is good! I get the bean burritos minus cheese and add rice and guacamole which is amazing! They say they don't use lard or chicken stock in the rice so it's suppose to be vegan;)"}
{"text":"I live close so I love little taco shops all over town this one is really good and not shitty good service and food is bomb"}
{"text":"This is just for the carne asada burrito that I bought. The carne asada was just alright, nothing special at all. Salsa in burrito was whatever too. I felt like the tortilla they used to wrap the burrito tasted a bit off, or stale if you may. I give the burrito a 2.5 rating, but I'll round up for now. I definitely prefer Roberto's, but I just wanted to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Viva El Taco has become my favorite taco place in Las Vegas. The food is authentic, the staff is nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I've eaten here plenty of times and always happy with the quality of the meal. My favorite are there fries with al pastor! It comes with all the fixings like nachos but instead of chips they use French fries!!! Love the salsas available too, compliments any item perfectly!  I like to order their shrimp burrito when I want a change of taste and it is scrumptious!!! Imagine jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla and there's your shrimp burrito.  I haven't eaten here in awhile mainly because service there has been on a downward spiral, I ordered thru the drive thru and it took me roughly twenty minutes to get my food, I understand (and appreciate) thoroughly cooked food but that's a long wait for drive thru service maybe they should hire a couple more workers to speed up productivity.  I gave this place 4 stars because I truly love the food and would recommend it to anyone, just have to make sure that they aren't in a hurry for their food"}
{"text":"Well I'm sorry my review ofViva  El Taco not good,. I went online to find Mexican food Viva El Taco was close. I ordered a Carnitas Asad Torrance to get home and get a frkn burrito. The bill was 2 plus dollars more than thier website. I asked the young lady why at about 10 pm on wens.may 25th.Her answer was there are several Viva El Tacos in town WOW WOW WHERE WHT FRKN Lie. The website shows 3.80 for a Carnation Asad, they charged me 5.15.Why do they advertise falsely and employees lie, lol does anyone pay attention to bill WOW"}
{"text":"I looked on Yelp to find some Mexican food close to where I live. I put in Mexican food in search, Viva El Ta o was close. I read reviews and thot I'd try. I ordered Carnitas combo plate and a Horsham. Got there 10 minutes later, very efficient. Bought food and went home to enjoy. The corn tortillas were hard, not rock hard but for sure not soft. The refried beans were salty . the Carnitas were very tasty.Online it read 5.95 for Carnitas combo, went to Pat and it was 8.95 they forgot Horsham and had to redo order, sorry was not worth it, maybe it was an off night which can happen, just being honest. The online menu on Yelp needs to be made current on prices. This is just an opinion God Bless"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for carnitas.  The night cook is a bit better than the day cook.  The ladies at the register are always nice and smiley.  Burritos and torta are nice and big.  Tacos are filling and tasty.  Prices are great."}
{"text":"Forget Roberto's and Pepe's Tacos! This place has great portions at affordable prices I love it I've lived here for 2 years now and it's the only Mexican joint I go to now just an amazing and open 24 hours. Not to mention 99-cent chicken Tacos on Wednesday that are fully loaded with chicken they don't skimp that's what I find awesome they give great portion of lettuce cheese and chicken ratio I find myself not wanting to stop eating them I've been to every Mexican taco place from Southern California all the way to Northern California. And now I found the best in Vegas I recommend it to all my friends highly recommend it to you my favorite thing is carne asada fries only if the french fries are extra crispy only downside about this place the bathroom is outside but it's pretty cool I got this Crazy Little Thing by the front door so you can wash your hands and the self-serve salsa bar is always rocking just an amazing job I only gave four stars and because of the bathroom location everything else was awesome keep up the good work and Beware of the red sauce it's harder than it looks green sauce on Chicken on the chicken tacos is Perfect combo"}
{"text":"Awesome and convenient place if you live around here, great carna Asada fries too! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was not packed. Waiters were pretty busy they took our drink orders very promptly but we had to ask for chips and salsa because it seemed like they were trying to keep up with all of the customers. The food was pretty good. Everyone was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"three stars is about right for this place. Nice menu, but the follow through is not there.  Food lacked flavor.  Beans were not good, tasted of out the can.  The food is lackluster and would get 2 stars, I threw in the third one because of value."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, hard to communicate with staff, language barrier. Love the food here, never too busy."}
{"text":"If you like tripas, this place is a freaking gold mine. I've tried tripas all over the place in Southern California, and this is the best place I've come across.  They deep fry them here and get them all extra crispy. A burrito with tripas, beans, cheese, and pico de gallo is perhaps the most satisfying thing ever.    If you are wondering what tripas are, they are the small intestine of a cow.  It sounds gross, but it kinda tastes like bacon with a mild liver flavor, and when they are crispy it has such a satisfying texture.  Also, the way they grill their tortillas for their burritos here is fantastic.  Most restaurants don't put that attention to detail in their burritos.  In fact I'm gonna go there right now and order a tripas burrito now that I think about it."}
{"text":"A 'taco happy hour'... whoever thought of such a place or thing.  Authentic in taste and of course $.79 per hard taco was well worth it.  I'll be back when I'm in a pinch for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Moved to the area and thought I'd try this place. Restaurant was clean, but the food was bland with little flavor. I ordered the chicken tacos and the meat had little to no flavor. Won't be back with all the other options in the area."}
{"text":"I Bought dinner with my wife and friends brought the food home right after it was cooked. The food was ice cold, the cheese on the nachos was a big blob not melted. The pork carnitas taco had little squares of meat that was horrible. You can tell they buy it frozen and pre diced. Not appitizing. We called them back and told them about the food there response (the girl at the desk who i tipped) was all tell them. So sad we used to go there everyweek now they just lost a lot of business are avg check was $35 bucks. I guess will just go to robertos from now on, at least they fix there issues and the food is cooked fresh and shredded not diced. Good luck with thst business."}
{"text":"They have delicious tacos al pastor here! I love how the meat is packed with tons of flavor and the salsa they put on really compliments it! Another favorite is the tacos de tripas fritas, coupled with beans that taste like home, this place has become one of my favorite go-to stops when I'm craving authentic food.  Shout out to the no-nonsense, but nice staff. You guys are amazing! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because it's close to the job. First off it was somewhat empty which isn't a bad thing because I was able to get my order quickly. First impressions of this place is that it is spacious for a taco shop. And the employees are nice and they get the food out fast . My issues with this establishment is that it reeked of paint fumes from the new coat they must've put on last night...Just an assumption. To the food,  I ordered a California Burrito and 3 rolled tacos. I always order more just in case one isn't enough due to size or taste and in this case it was definitely size. The rolled tacos here have to be the smallest I have ever seen in a taco shop. Trader Joe's black bean rolled tacos are bigger believe it or not! The meat in the rolled taco itself was skimpy too. Not impressed with it at all, however the California Burrito was surprisingly good and I believe cheaper than Roberto's! It was a pretty good sized burrito and it was loaded...definitely a plus. If I go back to this taco shop it will definitely be on the merits of their California Burrito. I may give this place another chance or I may not, It really depends. -1  paint fumes, -1  small rolled tacos"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for 2 combo plates with drinks, dine in or take out. My boyfriend and I decided to use it for takeout and have a movie night at my house.  The place was completely empty, so empty they started mopping up the floor from the entrance to the cash register; there was nowhere to step without leaving footprints when we walked in. One of the guys saw us coming and quickly threw a \"wet floor\" sign on the area (glad to see they care). From the moment we walked in and handed them our coupon, we could tell there was a very strong language barrier. The guys didn't seem to know what we were saying unless we mentioned something on the menu. Honestly, I never really find that to be a problem, but it was just a little tough trying to explain the coupon to him without seeming like we were ripping them off because it was already paid for.   After we were able to explain it to him he asked what we wanted. I asked him if I could get super nachos instead of a combo plate and he said yes. We ended up getting the super nachos and chile relleno combo plate and two drinks with the coupon. We noticed a sign on the side that said they were having a 99cent taco special going on so we got 6 tacos (4 carne asada, 2 pollo) because we felt back just walking out without having to pay for anything. Plus, we were having a movie munchie night so it was our time to get crazy.   As we were waiting for our food, we went to get our fountain drinks but a huge chunk of ice clogged the machine so we called one of the guys over to help us. He came over, but then ran back behind the counter to put on a pair of gloves because messing with the ice. I found that to be very sanitary because I imagine other places just pushing out the chunk of ice with bare hands. We waited less than 10 minutes for all our food and headed home. The food was still hot when we got home and we divided everything up amongst 4 people. The super nachos were like a volcanic mountain exploding with toppings; it was fantastic. Nothing special compared to other places like Roberto's, but nonetheless delicious. I didn't try the chile relleno, but I heard my mom and dad talking about how they didn't like the sauce on it (I'm not sure what kind of sauce they used). The tacos were all gone within 5 minutes, so they were obviously pretty tasty and cheap!  I'd like to come back here for their specials. From what I recall, they have quite a few specials going on everyday.  Like $5 fish taco combo plates from 11-2pm and 99 cent tacos."}
{"text":"I'm a big mexican food buff.  I continue on on my struggles to find at least one really good mexican food place in vegas.....  the search continues..."}
{"text":"We love going to this place. I would actually say its even better than Roberto's (shock). We just wish there were more locations.  The food is always great. The carrots and jalapenos are crisp and not soggy. The salsa's are pretty much the same as Roberto's. The carne asada is really good here. Sometimes the meat can be tough but, here its not. Hopefully, we can get more locations."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house and I've wanted to try it for some time. I was working near my house so the opportunity presented itself.  I had a combination plate beef burrito, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were average. The burrito was shredded beef with onions and what I believe was a sauce made of tomatillos, since it was tart. The volume of the sauce and onions, equaled that of the beef (imagine you ordered a quarter pound hot dog, and the covered it with a quarter pound of catsup and onions), the proportions were totally wrong and I didn't care for it. The cheese enchilada was just okay.  Well as I said, I wanted to try it, I did, I won't be back. Too many good Mexican restaurants to return here."}
{"text":"This taco shop is right around the corner from our house. We always go there to grab food when we want something quick and affordable. I do not eat meat so I always get their shrimp burrito and it is really delicious."}
{"text":"Solid, neighborhood taco shop. Their shop is clean, everyone is friendly, and the food is delicious. I'm especially fond of the burrito's.   On occasion I run into a language barrier. My Spanish is as good as my Esperanto. Which is to say, muy malo. But since I can point and they can understand my gesticulating, it works out. And I give them extra points for doing an excellent job on providing trays of food for an event. Everyone loved it. And everyone raved about those thick porridge-y beans.   This is an excellent alternative to more Americanized \"Mexican\" food. Do yourself a favor, por favor, and give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is not good. Tacos el gordo is better, I do better tacos, my lunch lady in Mansfield Mass in 1995 did better tacos. I would really have to order Tacos el Gordo and then take it into this place, make an identical order and really eat slowly , a little bit of each and find out what this place is missing. I'm not even going to read the other reviews on here, cuz I just don't see the 3.5 star rating....don't go here, try Rubalcabas down the road or Tacos El Gordo ! Don't eat here. You'll be fine without this place."}
{"text":"They got new tables, so the sticky issue is gone. Still not California Mexican food, but it's 24 hours and right next to my apartment. The weekday specials are a steal. Coke products, small salsa bar with cucumbers and limes."}
{"text":"The place is noticeably dirty, customer service is practically non existent. As for the food, it is pricey and everything tasted like it was re heated at least 2 or 3 times. Tortillas (for the soft tacos) were old and pretty 'gummy', the meat had no seasoning and tasted old, the burrito was greasy and tasteless. Finally the nachos were just a big blob of gunk ... A big pile of greasy, tasteless gunk. Don't waste your time in this place, I know I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible service... Didn't wash his hands ....he was on his lunch break... And on top of that... was on his phone in the middle of cooking my food grab the cheese with his bare hands"}
{"text":"I saw this place had some iffy reviews so I thought I would add mine.   We've been going here for at least four years and this place never disappoints. Their food is always great, the portions are huge, and the price is amazing. You can beat a breakfast burrito or a California burrito for $4.   My favorites here are all breakfast burritos, the California burrito, the carne asada fries or nachos, fish tacos, and tortas. My husband really likes the menudo and my son loves the quesadillas or rolled tacos.  Those are the only items I've tried so I can't really comment on anything else.   The salsa bar is always fresh and clean. On the weekends they usually have some kind of sweet treat out.   I'd recommend it over Robertos (which gave us food poisoning)."}
{"text":"Viva el Taco is a small shop located in a strip mall off of Ft. Apache and Tropicana. I stopped by last week at about 11:30 on a weekday and it was completely dead. So I had no trouble getting a quick lunch to go. The order: one carne asada, one carnitas, and one al pastor taco. Each taco was a single tortilla piled with plenty of meat, onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and guacamole. The carne asada was tough and chewy and the al pastor was lacking a depth in flavor or any bit of kick. The carnitas was the best of the three but hardly anything to write home about. They're a little pricier than some other taquerias around town, with each taco being $2.40."}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican place, little hole in the wall on lamb street. Posole was super yummy will be back!"}
{"text":"I guess I got the wrong thing.  I got the #4 2 beef tacos, rice and beans.  I really liked the rice!  It was light and fluffy.  The beans were not bad, but the tacos were bland.  So as I was down to my last bite, I notice this stick!  Kinda like a tooth pick but even harder than that!  If I had eaten that, I could have died!  Yes, I brought it to there attention, they apoligized.  I don't think I will be back!  That's not cool, not sure where that could have came from.  The food source or in house.   I don't think I will chance it again!"}
{"text":"Viva El Taco is very close to my house. It has been our preferred taco shop for 7 years. Despite coming here very regularly the staff acted very indifferent to us for years. Eventually, the woman who takes our orders started acknowledging us but making comments like \"wow, how can you eat the same thing all the time?\" Well, why would they care, I am giving them business? Still we remained loyal customers until our most recent incident. We were with friends and we decided to order nachos and a ton of tacos for sharing. My husband goes to pick up the food and the same employee who usually rings us up is there. She makes a comment about how we have started ordering a lot more food than in the past. Yes, as mentioned before, we have been coming here for years and we had two kids and have gradually started ordering more food. So my husband says \"yeah, we have the kids now and my son can eat a whole burrito by himself\" and she responds \"I don't know if that is a good thing\" at that point we decided we were done giving this place our business. I don't need someone looking at our orders and calculating what we are eating, what amount, etc. Really wondering why they wouldn't just appreciate our regular business instead of making snarky comments."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burrito! They also keep all of their salsas stocked fresh. They keep a clean establishment and always produce fresh., affordable food. Would definitely recommend for a cheap Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Robertos is quite a bit closer but it's well worth the drive. Food is always very fresh and the place itself is very clean. Definitely won't be back to the other place."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for an early dinner the other day.  I live around the corner and have never tried it.  Since Eddie D's is two doors down, I always get distracted.  However, this particular day I wanted Mexican Food and was determined to try it out.  I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito ($4.75) and an Al Pastor Taco ($2.40).  The restaurant is casual and has 15 or so tables, plenty of seating.  There's a small Salsa Bar (see pics) and a soda fountain.  The food came out after a short wait.   The Burrito was smoking hot....I could barely hold on to it, so I waited a few minutes while it cooled off a bit.  After cooling down a bit, I dove right in.  I was disappointed to discover that it's exactly like Roberto's Taco Shop.....damn.  The Carne Asada Burrito was just ok.....I think a bunch of Roberto's former employees must have went around town opening Taco Shops.  I don't think you would be able to distinguish between the two.  The Al Pastor Taco was a disappointment too.  It lacked the flavor that I expect from Al Pastor.....the smoky, marinated flavor.  It was bland.  Overall, it was disappointing, but filling and OK.  Will I return?  Probably not."}
{"text":"I had carne asada delivered to my house through doordash. I'm Mexican I'm sure whoever cooked my food was not Mexican. Don't be fooled this is not Mexican food! Anyway, my carne asada looked like dog food and beans tasted like they came out of a can. I  gave the carne asada to my dog and made my self a sandwich. Also, flour tortilla was huge, extremely oily, and not even good. I was greatly disappointed but my dog wasn't."}
{"text":"My review is for their carne asada fries. This is the only reason why I come here. They serve it in large portions with heaping amount of carne asada and it's so GOOD.   The staff is usually nice. I think they probably look confused because their english is limited.   I've also tried their fish tacos, carne asada burrito and tacos. The fish taco was not good at all. No flavor. The carne asada burrito was a 6/10. I've had better and same goes for the tacos."}
{"text":"The hubby brought home some take out from this place and honestly it was edible... but mostly a styrofoam box with a pile of bland goopy cheesy enchiladas rice and beans.  Taco was too greasy and boring.  The enchilada was swimming in too much sauce. Rice and beans okay. Just average tasting, one step above a cheap TV dinner and a half step above taco bell. Sorry won't be back:("}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to get your mexican food fix.  The taste is authentic but the place seems to just remain content with what they have rather than try to improve on what's good.  What might be affecting these good quality mexican food are the side trucks on the corner of the streets.    But the place is clean, the staff is nice and helpful.  So far I've ordered their burrito and tacos.  I've been pleased with both."}
{"text":"Listen. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I need to be upfront.  I am addicted to those spicy carrots you find at most mexican joints like this.  And this place maybe has the best in town!  not that the rest of the food is not tasty!  I usually get the carne asada nachos or a beef burrito.  Always delicious.    but the carrots.  /stomach growl  oh oh.  I guess i gotta go down there for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I came here when I was starving after a late-night flight for some late-night chow. #FAIL   I discarded my shrimp burrito mid-way b/c it had a glass-cleaner/freezer-burnt taste and was generally repulsive. I knew that if I finished it, I'd feel like crap for the entire next day. After a few bites I felt like I'd just chowed down a harvest of grain. My poor stomach."}
{"text":"Great carne asada and fantastic enchiladas!!  Very nice people own and run this place, and I stop by a lot for the great deals."}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place! And I'm actually ashamed to admit how much we eat here... When we first moved near here we thought it would be a nasty whole in the wall restaurant, so for years we'd pass by on our way home and finally I said 'why don't we try this place out', and BAM we loved it! And their always super nice. Ps kearny Asada fries are a must..."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place to eat Mexican food  The order came fast and the food is fresh.  Pretty good place to eat if you like Mexican food"}
{"text":"Usually go thru drive-thru, but went inside. I do like they have a sink with soap and paper towels to wash your hands before you eat!  I ordered a Breakfast Burrito with Ham, it wasn't to busy so the wait wasn't long at all. They have the red and green salsa with limes, radishes, carrots, and onions.  My burrito was very hot and I had to wait to eat it as to not burn a layer of skin from my mouth, as it was cooling down enough to eat I munched on some sliced radishes and they were nice and crunchy.  So now my burrito had cooled down minimally so I doused it with red salsa that was very flavorful. Plenty of ham for sure, I swear I could hear it oinking! Potatoes, Eggs, Cheese and Ham, what a combination!  Ok time for a nap!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I may have been a bit premature with my previous review of Viva El Taco. I still think their food is good and very much like Robertos. There is one big problem I have with them when compared to Robertos though. I went back to Viva last night for the $0.99 chicken tacos I mentioned previously. I got there around 6:10. I ordered 3 chicken tacos and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The price came to almost $10. WHAT?!  By my math it should have been closer to $6. When I questioned this high price I was pointed to the small print of a hand written sign that said the special price was only from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That is just crazy to offer cheaper tacos during non peek hours. After lunch and before dinner. No wonder the restaurant was completely empty when I walked in. And they would not honor the price even though I was just a few minutes late. So I cancelled my order and went to Robertos instead. And do you know what? Robertos was packed. Kinda makes you think."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their carne asada plate, carnitas, and shrimp diabla are all delicious! My mother usually gets the diabla or mojo shrimp. I personally love the quesadillas here. I know that may sound weird but I love me a good cheesy and crispy quesadilla when I see one. Especially when you want something quick or late night because they're open 24 hours. Best little Mexican joint on Lake Mead. I live in Cali and go to this restaurant every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the chimichanga from here. Wasn't bad at all. Was actually the best one I had at a fast food mex shop. When you order anything with chicken you can tell them you don't want it with onions and peppers. By doing this they won't serve you the chicken that's been sitting in the pot all day with the onions and peppers (like Roberto's does). Instead they grill all white meat chicken and stuff that bad boy in your chicken burrito or chimichanga. Its def way better and cleaner"}
{"text":"I always call in my order food is OK just don't like the chicken they use its boiled not grilled for their plates"}
{"text":"Skip the carnitas. Taste like fake tofu that smells almost like a bad attempt at carnitas. Hubs didn't really like the chimichanga either. Kind of disappointed will stick with our Roberto's and Tacos El Compita! At least the quesadilla was good can't really mess up a quesadilla."}
{"text":"I love there carne asada fries with soda. what a steal and it taste authentic than other place. if looking for a cheap fast food Mexican (haha) viva el taco is the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"Been going her for years. Great prices and huge portions. Breakfast burrito is great."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years...Food very tasty.. Girls at counter, always pleasant..The prices sure beat the big restaurants... The prices are identical to Roberto`s, , I live the  same distance between these two....but I usually come here for one  silly reason,,,, the self-serve salsa...very good....Roberto`s doesn't have salsa, they have HOT sauce only,,& it can burn the chrome off of a bumper.....Didn't give 5 stars, cause they don't have beer..."}
{"text":"Okay, so this isn't gourmet Mexican food by any means. However, if you want a good ground beef taco, fried to perfection with those delicious greasy dripping running down your hand while you are eating it....... this is the spot! Toppings are fresh and accent the taco perfectly.  It definitely fits the bill when that craving hits!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place.  Im a picky eater when it comes to Mexican food and they made everything I wanted the way I wanted it.  Carne Asada Fries to die for...YUMMMM!  Beans and rice were really good and so was the chicken burrito.  I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Man, I don't know how to feel about this place.  I mean, I want to like it. It's near my office. The prices are fair. The food is good. The place is clean. They have a lot of salsa and stuff. But, that's just it. Everything seems par for the course here. There isn't anything that really blows me out of the water.   The only thing that makes me like this place is that the service is always fast. That cannot be denied! Still, that's not enough to keep me coming here over going to other places."}
{"text":"This is Mexican food. I have been coming here for about 7 years and the entire time it has never disappointed. Personally, I have a hard time finding good pastor in Vegas. This place is one of the very few exceptions. Not too greasy and plenty of flavor! Viva has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I came in the afternoon and besides myself there were only two other people. I ordered the cheese enchilada combo plate and the carne asada burrito with only beans and cheese. The food was delicious and you can't beat the price! I took a menu to go and am planning to bring the boyfriend by so he can try it. The food was cooked to order and very fresh. Their salsa bar was good, it looked like the carrots had been sitting out for longer than they should have though. No worries here, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit hit or miss.   I've eaten here dozens of times in 4 years of living within walking distance.   Some days it's amazing. Some days you get simultaneously burnt and undercooked fish tacos with lettuce and cheddar cheese and no sauce. Some days the carne asada is perfect, some days it seems boiled instead of seared. Some days your quesadilla is crispy and gooey, some days it's soggy and sitting in a puddle of grease.  They do it right often enough that I stop in fairly frequently, but I'm not gonna pretend it's not a hot mess every once in a while."}
{"text":"you guys are the best! roberto's can't hold a candle to you!   LOVE u guys! ty!"}
{"text":"The carne asada here is always a lot better than what I've had at other taquerias.  I've had the restraint not to order the carne asada fries for quite a while, but they are made perfectly here.  I'm not a decadent dessert kind of guy, so things like carne asada fries are my definition of a guilty indulgence.  If you've never had it, it's basically a pile of crispy french fries covered with nacho toppings.  Not everything else on the menu is quite as good as the carne asada, but I don't think I've ever ordered anything that I disliked."}
{"text":"Called in 2 burritos with carne asada, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to go.  No problemo right!    Downside, the only heard one burrito, and had one burrito, so we just paid for the one and left.    Burrito and ingredients were very good.  The burrito was on the small side, but it was only $5.40, so not too bad.   Will I be back, yes, will I make sure I triplicate my order, yes.    The red sauce (on the side) too hot."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here several times before, and each time previous the food was fast, cheap, and delicious. Sure, it's named differently but anyone who is anyone in Vegas knows it's the exact same food and menu as a Roberto's.  That's not my issue, however.  My problem is the last two times we went, it was late at night since my wife works a late swing shift. I'm not sure how the training works for these franchises, but aside from the questionable customer service, I can assume proper food handling and safety is not a part of the training and I will explain why based on what I saw with my own eyes.  We go in to order, and the cook, who was also working the register, was busy taking care of a big order before us. He pauses to take our order, without ringing us up and continues to finish the order before us. After 10-15 minutes since we entered, he finished the first order and continues to work on ours. Shortly after, he finishes our food and comes to cash us out. We went to pay with card but he told us he didn't know how to work the register or the card machine. He suggested us returning the next day to pay, which was a bit off to us both.  Now I mentioned questionable customer service, and it honestly can be overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that while he was working on our food, he was not wearing gloves, and he had open cuts on his hand which were bleeding as he was making our food and touching the register(and believe me when I say these cuts were deep enough to visibly see the blood) . It completely made us both sick to our stomachs and we had to leave.  We don't want to go back there knowing someone is bleeding all over our food, it's just unfortunate since the times we ate there previously everything was good, which is why Im giving a fair 2 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"Honestly what brings the rating of this place down is the customer service. The food is decent, but when you walk in, there's no greeting. You walk up to the cashier, and there's not even a smile, nor a may I help you. At first I thought she might be having a bad day, very understandable... we all have them, but getting the same vibe during my second visit made me not want to go there again. I'd much rather drive a bit more up the street to where I feel welcome."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST BURRITOS.. What more can I say. I love their breakfast burritos. They're only like $5 after tax and filled pretty big. My girlfriend and I love getting the ham. It's diced chunky, and the potatoes are somewhat mashed and pretty good that way. Their salsa verde (green sauce) compliments it real well, with their red sauce pretty spicier when compared to other Mexican joints. I rate it 4 stars cuz we had went early on a Saturday with a different cook I assumed cuz it was smaller than usual -- and I decided to try the machaca (shredded beef) breakfast burrito and it was WAY too wet and dripped all over my girlfriend's seat and my pants.. So watch out if you ever decide to get machaca, just sayin. Overall this place is great for what it is!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican spots in Vegas, and I'm coming from Long Beach.. No its not fancy and the area is not the best but the food is always good and they have excellent salsas that are the opposite of most places watered down stuff.. especially the orange-ish colored one that I'm assuming has habanero in it, so good! My favorite items are the chorizo, pastor and chicken tacos, pretty good size.. They also make a pretty mean Chile Verde burrito. If you're scared of the area just hit the drive thru open 24 hours but make sure you ask for the extra hot salsa!"}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo - you have to eat or do something Mexican on this day.  The BF and I headed to Viva El Taco to satisfy this Mexican craving.    I would say Viva El Taco is similar to the Roberto's Taco Shop chain.  The pictures and menu on the wall are mirror images.  I went with the #5 Combination Plate (Beef Burrito & Cheese Enchilada) for $5.65.  However, I substituted the Cheese Enchilada for a Pork Tamale.  It also came with rice and beans.  The rice was kinda dry, and remain untouched, but the refried beans were pretty good with  melted cheese.  My beef burrito had chunks of tender beef oozing out along with peppers and the BF wouldn't stop eating my order.  The tamale was on the dry end though, and it's covered with cheese and sauce to make up for it.  I didn't bother finishing the tamale.  The BF had three Al Pastor tacos at $2.15/each.  He thought they were pretty loaded compared to what he gets from Roberto's Taco Shop.  The self service \"salad bar\" had fresh cucumbers and radishes to neutralize the heat from the chipotle sauce, green hot sauce, jalapeno peppers, carrots, and onions, and fresh green onions.  The gigantic horchata was pretty good too and is a must with all Mexican food.    Overall, Viva El Taco is another chain among the chains of Mexican food in Las Vegas.  It's definitely better and more authentic than a Del Taco or Taco Bell any day.  It's casual enough for a quick bite as well.  Sidenote:  They have coupons offering $0.99 bean burritos, three rolled tacos, beef tacos, and chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours fresh hot Mexican food. Good flavor good portions. Bit pricey but great friendly service"}
{"text":"Viva El Taco has been my late night stop since before I met my husband. Now that we live in Henderson I seldom get the chance to stop. So last week when we were on the way to my Dad's we stopped by. Wow! They have not changed a bit! Still yummy as ever!   This was my husbands first time trying Viva El Taco. He ordered the Al Pastor burrito and I got the Carne Asada burrito. Both were loaded with meat, guacamole and pico! Mmmmm soooo tasty! They also have a killer fish taco. My husband has been craving that burrito ever since!  Not only is the food awesome, but the prices are great too. If your on the east side make sure you swing by for some tacos."}
{"text":"This is a casual little taco shop. It appears clean. The food was average taco shop fare. The service was average as well. Nothing great to say,  nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"I always come here for the huevos rancheros, because they are amazing here. But recently I've tried to fish tacos and can't get enough. I love this place and I will always be here breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Ill say its Delicious. Ordered a Carne Asada Burrito. Its a little pricier than other locations. It came out fast and fresh. The Carne Asada was fresh and moist. I got it loaded with Guac and Pico De Gallo. The Staff was friendly and speak good english so no worries with a language barrier. The Menu is expansive with Breakfast,And Lunch/Dinner items. Nice Seating area. And The restuarant is spotless which is always a good indication of how the food will taste."}
{"text":"First of all it looks nice from the outside.  When you walk in it's pretty filthy ..  None of the tables are wiped down . There is a bunch of flys everywhere just going on top of the food ... You can't even eat in peace without those things buzzing around your food....  The food it's self was okay but not enough to make me come back...  No bathrooms"}
{"text":"I usually come here once a week. I really like the chicken nachos. Although I was very very disappointed  tonight. There was NO CHIPS!!!! I really enjoyed the chicken but I saved it so I can go buy some chips to eat it with it and cheese. Make my own. Shame on the cook for ruining my nachos tonight!!!!"}
{"text":"my wife and i decided to try a different taco shop and ordered the milanesa torta it was very dry and chewy and the chicken quesadilla had hardly any chicken in it and no cheese more tortilla than anything...they have no flavor quality of meat is terrible and the portion they put in there meals is Not worth 16 dollars could have gone elsewhere and got more for my money up the road at Robertos taco shop where we usually go for our mexican plates will not be coming back, don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Try a big steaming bowl of their Pozole with its savory broth, large pieces of pork and hominy, and add all the condiments that are given to you for it, so so good. Their Chile Relleno are awesome by themselves or in a burrito too."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru today for lunch. I had tacos al pastor and husband had rolled tacos. Food came out fast and it was pretty tasty. $12 for lunch for two...not bad. In a sketchy neighborhood but I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Me and my bf would come here all the time, he would get the super nachos and me the carne asada fries. One night when we ate our food I noticed the meat tasted a little off so I was reluctant to eat anymore. My boyfriend finishes his and then next day we both woke up with what seems to be TERRIBLE FOOD POISONING. We were both vomiting all day going through HELL and we both experienced the same exact thing and it was terrible. We were not sick at all before coming here and both the nachos and fries share the carne asada. Sad, but will NEVER be returning again."}
{"text":"There are days that I really really really miss their quesadillas but my husband and I got food poisoning from here a couple months ago and now we won't return."}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed with the beef burrito but OMG on the enchiladas and its sauce. Ask for a side of nachos to soak up all the deliciousness! Forget the border if you are craving mexican and in the area they are a must try!"}
{"text":"Update!  This is my second visit here. I don't know if it was a coincidence that on my first visit here I ordered when I was alone.  Second visit, my husband (who is half black, by the way) came with me.  Anyway, we ordered the same as last time, Chilaquiles with no egg.   I don't know if they think it's ridiculous to order chilaquiles with no egg or the fact that my husband, who is black, is with me, who is fair toned.  *I've eaten at places that seem to single out people who come in by OBVIOUS STARING AND JUDGING just for being there. I think it's just happened to us AGAIN, in a different way. And last time it was at Tacos El Gordo by the way. Racist!   Anyway, so as we waited patiently for our order, some 15 people ordered AFTER us & BEFORE we got our order.  After about 10 Carne Asada Fries that came out after our order, we asked the lady at the register where our food was? She said it wasn't ready yet. Which to me, is obviously not true. I know this because I work with food and I know what takes longer to put together. It takes much more effort to build 10 Carne Asada Fries than it is to make 2 orders of Chilaquiles WITH NO EGG! Where in the world would it ever take a total of 45 minutes for a simple breakfast dish? Nowhere! If this happens to you, you're getting played! I just played! Let me just say this, she did not have a single care that we just waited half an hour while others were getting served before us. So, we decided to wait by the counter until our food was ready. As it should've been already anyway.  After another 10 minutes, she slides us our order and didn't even say a word as she greets the next person in line. If I wouldn't have asked if it was ours, I wouldn't have even known. So rude! No thank you. No sorry. Not even an excuse for the wait. No nothing. We asked again why it took so long for us to get our food when we ordered before all those people? She said, \"well next time you should call your order in!\"  That was just the most ridiculous thing I ever heard and honestly it was so unprofessional of her. Also, she did not apologize or compensate us for our wait in any way, like any other decent food establishment would have done. And I really hope the management here reads this and does some changes with the lack of care for those that work with customers on their customer service and total lack of compassion. And not for me particularly, but for the sake of others because I will not come back here again.   This was written on January 14th, 2018 from a very upset pregnant (half white) woman who is married to a (half black) man.  The end."}
{"text":"10 times better than Robertos up the block! Thank God I found this place by my house I'll definitely be back. Chicken tacos were on point!"}
