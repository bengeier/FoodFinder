{"text":"I had a sinus infection and decided to get some soup on the way home from the Dr. I commented about it not being hot and was told bc I was late picking it up. I still ate it....not tasting right, but I thought it was my sinuses. Woke up sick as a dog as bad as you can imagine... and had to call out of work the next day I called and was told they have a (xx.x...sorry I didn't care at that point)  sanitation score and it wasn't them..... I wasn't trying to be rude, just informative bc I had gotten sick. Too bad. I'll never go back . Sad not many places around here.."}
