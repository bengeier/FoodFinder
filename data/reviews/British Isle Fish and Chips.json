{"text":"Great fish and chips always fresh made to order. Little pricey but worth it! Service is not so friendly but once you get to know him he is great :)"}
{"text":"We didn't get to try the food. We came in on a Friday night, and we were seated by the only server in the restaurant. 10 minutes later, we still have not received the menu. We were not sure if we need to order up on the counter, or wait. After a few more minutes, another couple came in and were seated. They were given the menu right after. So my husband walked over to the counter and asked for the menu. The server apologized that she forgot to give us one. A few more minutes passed and we were ready to order, the server still hasn't visited our table, but saw her getting the order from the newcomers. We took it as a hint and left. Forgetting to give us the menu is one, but forgetting to take our order is a bit to much. They should expect Fridays to be busier than usual, it would be a good idea to have another server on busy nights.I won't know if I missed a good fish and chips, and I wouldn't know because I am not planning on coming back. For me, first impressions linger. I am willing to try mediocre food with good service but not the other way around."}
{"text":"The first time I went there with my dad the food was great.  Tonight was no so great.  The halibut was fresh but the batter was too thick, fried to a dark brown crisp and was greasy.  We showed the fish was offered a new piece which was very kind.  However when we paid the cook insisted that there was nothing wrong with the fish and kept repeating that to my dad.  Not how you treat customers.  Not sure if I will go back because of the service.   Its a shame since the first visit was so good."}
