{"text":"We ordered Roses pizza, Calamari and Tandoori Chicken. Average food. Would I go back? Probably not for a long time. Service was good although the waitress my mistake charged us more on the pizza. When I brought it up to her attention she fixed it right away. Overall, just average experience."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon voucher and drove half an hour to the restaurant to redeem it. There is no parking at the back and parking on Yonge is not allowed, so we parked across the street at the Centrepoint mall and climbed over the snow bank and slush with two small kids to get there.  The promotional value of our Groupon has expired for 2 weeks, but it says on the voucher that the face value of the voucher will never expire. Regardless, the owner refused to honour it. We said it's mandated by law that all purchased vouchers have a face value like gift certificate that does not expire. The owner didn't care. We said then we'll go elsewhere...they said it's up to you.  And we were the ONLY customers there around dinner time.  No wonder.  The Korean restaurant next door offers much better service."}
{"text":"I had a decent experience here; however, the pizza crusts appear to be formed & pre-made and for a $17/$18 price point I'd expect hand-made dough. That said, I went on a day where one of their pizzas was discounted to $11 -- where I feel the price should be 100% of the time. Beyond that, the atmosphere was nice and the service was good (although we were the only people in the restaurant). With a few tweaks (including ditching the bad house music) I could see myself going back."}
{"text":"The service was nothing special here, my friend got a knife that was not cleaned properly. The lady didn`t check up on us after serving and taking our order. We went here for lunch on a Saturday. The place seems modern in design.  The place is somewhat hidden as I had never noticed it before looking it up on the website. The food was a bit below standards compared to other persian places I have had food at (Zaffron, Taftan Kebab, and Khorak)."}
{"text":"Came here today and was disappointed in the cheeseburger and so were my friends - it had a weird cream sauce that was not listed on the menu.  My friend got a \"sausage\" appetizer which ended up being hot dogs in hot sauce :( service was ok though."}
{"text":"Moat of the popular iranian food is served in good quality. Swrvers are friendly. Persian music is on via pmc satelite channel. A cozy and warm restaurant open until 4 am"}
{"text":"Worst experience here on a Friday night. Won't be coming back. Avoid this place at all costs. Came here on a Friday night and there's one table inside. I waited extremely long for my food and drinks as they are short staffed with only 2 servers and one of the server is missing and the bartender kept telling me she's looking for her. Eventually the other server got to us and told us food is still not ready. I don't understand what's happening. There's one table inside on a Friday night.   Night is ruined by this horrific experience !"}
{"text":"Didn't like the movie playing while I was eating. The movie showed boobs, blood, gore, and murder. Food was ight."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my fiancé. We had the pleasure of getting Dakota as our server. She was extremely helpful and friendly with a constant smile on her face.  I ordered the salmon entree and my fiancé got the chicken sishkabob. The food was decent but not anything we can't make at home ourselves. The Rose's fries were pretty good though.  Overall, I enjoyed my visit, and will be back."}
{"text":"This place offering decent Persian taste, not probably the best but it's OK. I usually order Roses Pizza which I really like, I also like Chicken Kebab too. If you are looking for a fast, yummy, decent food, probably worth a shot. Try Roses Fries, as I really like it."}
{"text":"Pros:  friendly environment  Nice server Reasonable price  Cons: Bad food quality   Everything was good but the food! We felt like eating last night left over warmed up in a microwave! We ordered a variety of food and none was fresh."}
{"text":"A glorified Costco burger and fries. Actually prefer Costco cafeteria over this place. Much better eats in the area."}
{"text":"Overall good experience I'd say. If you live in the Fort York/City Place area it's worth checking out. They also have hooks for $30  Service: greeted straight away, then abandoned for 20 minutes before we ordered anything. We almost left but I'm happy we didn't. My only complaint. Service the rest of the night was good.  Ambiance: great atmosphere with modern shabby chic decor. Small restaurant with a large patio. Will be great in the summer. Clean washrooms which I really appreciate.   Food: Lebanese flair- eggplant dip was great. Pizza was good, nice chewy crust- don't order of you are into thin crust crispy. Burgers looked huge but we didn't have. Tomato salad was VERY lemony- good but don't order as a main. VERY reasonable prices. Think $10 burger, $8 salad."}
{"text":"Positive : + open very late + very reasonable price for good quality food + good variety in menu Negative : - parking can be an issue in busy hours - their amazing pizza takes toooo long to be ready !"}
{"text":"It was not worth the money! I was not happy with the food or the price.   When I arrived there with my husband, I didn't feel like eating there at all.    However, I decided to stay because my husband wanted to try Roses's for a long time. Besides, the atmosphere looked nice and the waitress seemed attentive.  We ordered only two dishes; Calamari and Pillow pizza.  My husband said the pizza was ok but it wasn't ok for me. He also said that it tasted like there were shredded hot dogs on it!  The calamari was worse.  It wasn't hot.  It didn't look like it came from deep fried at all.  It sounds funny but I mean it.  Calamari was soft and tasted like it stayed frozen for a long time.  It looked definitely like the frozen calamari you can buy from Sobeys!  Meh!    Service was fine but I didn't think it was a good idea for two waitresses to eat at the same time.  You had only two waitresses at the time.  I don't mind if you guys take turns for a break and have a snack but it doesn't look ok when both of you turn your back to the customers and eat something behind the bar.   We live in City-place, however I'm not coming back.  The price was too expensive for the food.  I'd rather go somewhere else for the same price and have a much nicer experience."}
{"text":"We tried Rose's burger and it was amazing! The meat just melts in your mouth and has so much flavour. I am a huge French fry fanatic and I love how crunchy and warm they are :)   Ambience is a bit loud but it fits the lounge/bar theme.  Service is a tad slow but not unbearable."}
{"text":"Okay, so let me tell you something about myself whenever I review a restaurant: I don't like to give one stars. I try to take into consideration that my sole experience is going to be way different than other people's experiences so I take each thing with a grain of salt. However, I am very disappointed with the management here and the quality of food.  My husband and I came here to try this new location and we're not expecting to be disappointed at all, considering the North York location was much better in terms of their food quality. We came in and were seated right away. We asked for waters and (this is the first thing that surprised me) they brought us bottled water. I asked if we could just have tap water with ice to which the hostess/ server replied that they do not serve tap water at their restaurant. I am pretty sure that there is a by-law stating that free water must be offered to places where they serve food. She said that the government told her that she isn't able to serve as after from the tap because of the pipes or something...uh- okay. That doesn't sound safe! How do they wash their dishes?? With bottled water?  Next, I ordered a Greek salad. It wasn't really a Greek salad. Green olives instead of black and it came with this creamy sauce (I didn't want a creamy sauce, that's why I ordered the Greek) but it was fine- I didn't want to make a big deal about it. It was still tasty and the portion sizing was large.   My husband is Persian and was familiar with the menu so he ordered bandari and two cheeseburgers for us. I've never had Bandari before but I felt like it tasted bland. It was hard to eat even half of it. As for the burgers, they came with the buns burnt and crispy/hard. My first bite just tasted like burnt bread and nothing else. We asked the hostess/ server to take it back and she just stood at our table asking \"Why?\". She eventually took the plates and after waiting a long time we decided we had lost our appetite and the wait was too long. Just as we decided to leave, our burgers came out and we got them for take out.  Before I left I asked why we weren't allowed to have tap water and that's when the lady told me what \"the government\" said about their taps.   Overall, my experience was very sour and the service made me feel awkward and unwelcome. After having a bland bandari sandwich and a burnt bite of hamburger, I was thirsty and not feeling full. I know I could've just paid for the bottled water but when the lady gave me that odd answer I just did not want to give them anymore of my service.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my best persian Restaurant, quite, cozy and friendly atmosphere. We went there with our friends and had a enjoyable time there. If you are looking for a place to chill, relax and Have a delicious Foods, Go there."}
{"text":"This place is a mess! Me and a couple friends came here the other night and one of the guys from the other table kept calling the waitresses bitches. A big argument broke out and it seems like there's no proper management here whatsoever because the waitress had to defend herself from this really aggressive guy. We kept asking her if she was okay, and she said she was fine but I honestly don't feel good when men call women bitches. Where is the manager? Why didn't the manager escort these people out? I hope those waitresses are okay, and I don't think this restaurant is going to survive if this type of behaviour is able to happen."}
{"text":"Cute neighbourhood restaurant, beautiful decor and not too busy as we went on a Wednesday night. This is a middle eastern place and has reasonable prices. The food was okay, but you get what you pay for. We ordered chicken and barg kebobs. They were good but they tasted like something you could get at the food court. Huge portions so we could not finish. Service was Great though, we had a very attentive waitress"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. We called ahead to order take out.  When we arrived they told us that they made the wrong pizza by mistake and it would take 20 minutes to fix it or we could just take what they made! We agreed to take the pizza but it still took them forever to check out the order so all of our food was getting cold as we are waiting to pay.  When we got home we realized the toppings on the pizza were burnt and they missed a few items we had ordered and paid for.  The customer service and quality of food is definitely lacking here."}
{"text":"Nice place they have very good and tasty food but not healthy at all. So if you looking to get some healthy food forget about it. They have there own signature stuff like pizza fries and others. I tried both they are very good but they add there own special sauce which makes it not healthy but tasty.   They have some big tables which can fit larger group of people like 10 which is good if you coming with bunch of people. The place suppose to be Persian food but it seemed more American to me as it is all fries, pizza and subs.   Over all I recoment this place specially on Tuesday as they have half price pizza and they rose pizza."}
{"text":"Make sure you try the tandori chicken and flat bread my favourite we need more like this in the area"}
{"text":"Been to the new Fort York location twice now first during their first month opening, and again two months after. Both times have been pretty underwhelming. As a resident of CityPlace, I was excited to have another new restaurant open up. Hunter's Landing is a great option, but service is terrible, and Roses New York looked more intimate and one of those places Spectra or Quartz residents can stop by after work regularly. They have two big screens and usually air sports games, which is a huge plus, and music and atmosphere is where they excel--if a bit small (or again, intimate).  And then the food... The first time I came on a Saturday and ordered their burger. It was around $7 which was very affordable, but then they mentioned the fries and any sides are extra for around $5. (Okay, I see what you did there, no biggie). I dug in and had a bite of the burger, and experienced an odd mix of goat cheese that in my opinion did not suit the burger. Now it is a Persian inspired menu, so it may just be my tastes, but many of my friends who I brought didn't enjoy it much either--and they were hungry and drunk which is saying a lot. The fries were alright, a bit salty, but nothing special. Big side portion though and I managed to share with two other people. Overall, the first experience was fair, nothing special. We had take out and it took a little long, but I really wanted to sit in just to enjoy the atmosphere another time.  Two months later, they should have been all ready for regular business and I wanted to give them another shot. I stopped by just myself on a Tuesday night, and stayed in to order their salmon for around $17. Their drink menu was great and they do Shisha as well. They were playing the Raptors game on both screens, the crowd was genuinely friendly, and servers were very helpful. It was not overly crowded for a small space, but it didn't feel deserted ether. The food came by a lot sooner this time around too. I looked down on my plate to see that presentation was very lacking. It looked like something I would've just plopped on myself after a busy day from work. I tasted the salad with dried carrots sprinkled on top, and the dressing was not enough, nothing spectacular either. The salmon was dry, and I had to ask the waiter for sauce that goes well with the salmon. She handed me what looked like mayo and ketchup, and she mentioned that it was what the chef gives to all customers who ask for sauce (I could tell the chef gets asked this a lot). I finished the plate, and my favourite part was the Persian rice, but sadly again, my experience was very underwhelming.  I really hoped this place would do well considering the lack of local places to CityPlace residents. My final verdict is that it is a great place to come by for drinks and have their sides, socialize after work, and catch a game with a friend or two. But if you are coming for a meal, do not expect much offerings here. Still, I do see potential though. When I got my bill, they asked me to fill out a questionnaire about how they did, and you can bet my feedback was as honest as possible. The workers seem to really care and want the place to succeed. Maybe in a few more months, I'll give it another go."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place! the food takes you straight home to iran. although they dont have traditional iranian foods, they have the iranian touch to everything and that's the best part. The attire was fancy-casual and the service was awesome. it is a little small and dark but not that bad. Love it!"}
{"text":"Everyone must try the special fries n pizza amazing !  Service is usually great too!  Did I mention the Pizza is amazing ?"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 cheese burgers, rose salad, veal tongue and brains sand which.  Burger was dry and lacked flavour and was covered in sauce which you would think would make it taste amazing. But it didn't. Has 1/4 slice of tomato and 2 thin thin pickle slices  Rose salad came without salad dressing 100% isn't worth 11.99 it's just iceberg lettuce some bologna and like 5 slices of cucumber   The tongue sand which was dry and mostly bread.  Will not be back"}
{"text":"Honestly for late night food it's not horrendous, but realistically I won't be going here again the food simply wasn't good."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place, I came by around august and it was closed for renovations. Space looks good, menu is fairly interesting, I ordered a chubby pizza, lots of flavour, would easily  feed two people, one person if you are really hungry. Service however is poor. The hostess was helpful but one of the servers was too busy chatting with her friend the entire time, I tried to get her attention multiple times but I was completely ignored, to the point I had to get up and ask the hostess for the bill. Over all experience was not so good. If I ever felt like having their food, I'll order as delivery.  Pizza Coke  Hst  ------ Total $ 22.45"}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend to this place and the food was good in general. The downside, first was the parking issue, second, we went on a Friday's night and the place was pact due to their small space so it took them sometimes before giving us a table then also took them a long time to bring our food."}
{"text":"Great veggie burger only one server but she did a great job dealing with multiple parties. The chocolate cake was delicious."}
{"text":"The food at this place is very good everything on the menu is worth trying and prices are fair as well, how ever the service sucks ! The waiter/waitress do not check up on you or pay attention to your order I have a friend who is allergic to parsley we had to send her food back three times cause they kept on bringing the food with parsley ! And the end she give and send the food back. they still wanted to charge us for it !! Be really clear about what you order and order everything at once and ask them to read it back to you"}
{"text":"Tried the beef sausage app and egg plant dip app and mushroom burger and papa pizza for main. Not good. Apps were with sausage from departmental store. The eggplant felt home made.  The burger had very good beef patty but that was it. The sauce on burger was very home like. The pizza was Arab style - no tomato sauce. I think this is mainly middle eastern but they don't say it. Perhaps the kebab dishes would have better choices. Cause I didn't try the kebabs, I've given these guys 3 star - giving them benefit of the doubt till I try their kebab. I'd definitely suggest skip  the pizza and burgers for sure."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years, their burgers always exceed your expectations. Great staff and friendly people."}
{"text":"Delicious! We tried out Rose's on their opening night. Even though it was their first day, the staff was wonderful and calm and were quick to serve us. We had their garden salad, chubby pizza and chika pizza. Everything was delicious and exceeded my expectations. I love their Persian influence. The pizza was amazing. (Chika was my favourite.) Our server Natasha was lovely and very helpful. The owner even sent us a delicious dessert on the house. I will definitely be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"The WORST service ever! I will NEVER COME back again!!!  We were a group of 7 persons! We get our foods very late and it was at least 5 min delay between bringing each one of them! They even FORGOT one of our friend's order!  The food that I got (ash reshteh, kashke bademjun) was not really delicious in my opinion but my friends liked it!   The music was bad according to most of my friends but I liked it!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this restaurant a few times and always wondered why it was empty. Thought I would try it out and I'm kind of surprised because the food tastes so much better and affordable than some of the other restaurants on that strip and the decor isn't bad. They open till 2am for food.   Food: Love their burgers. If you like the middle eastern spice flavour, their burger meat is filled with it and quite flavourful. Comes with a side of fries, sweet potato fries or salad. I also really like their flatbread. Good size and lots of toppings. Their pizza's are a decent size as well and always come with lots of toppings.   Drinks: standard selection  Decor: modern, cozy, lounge like atmosphere. Great place to have a private party or drop by for food or drinks if you don't want to make dinner that night. Too bad the crowd is usually small, but I don't mind.  Service: prompt and attentive. Appears they have some regulars that drop by and like to carry conversation with the servers, but that shouldn't upset anyone as I've read in some of the reviews. The servers still do their jobs and check on their other patrons.  Overall: this place has potential, I would check it out if you live in the area and just want to grab a bite close by or if your down watching a game."}
{"text":"Ok as promised I did return here and this time I tried some of their authentic middle eastern dishes and was very impressed. This time, the wait times for our food were much faster, the services levels which were great before, were just as good this time around and the food was excellent. My advice? Try anything except the pizza, or burgers (you can get these items anywhere) and go for the authentic special menu items (kabobs, stews, etc) your tastebuds will thank you for this :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why this is called Roses New York...I have never, since the opening-relocation-renovation-and multiple \"changes in management\", seen anybody order a pizza here!!  The food is inexpensive and the place is open super late (unusual to the neighborhood), thus making it ideal for a late night snack before heading back home from the party.  While the sandwiches are tasty and usually ready in reasonable time, I am not completely convinced about the quality of the ingredients...but you can't have everything together I guess.  Key point is that the owners have been really cool in playing world cup and world cup qualifying matches since about 2005. One of the only places I went for Asian qualifiers and was not hassled to get something new every 5 minutes or pay a $10 entry charge. So they get an automatic start for that."}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. We ordered the Roses Pizza and ash reshteh for appetizer. The pizza was small and the toppings were weird. There was what appeared to be ground \"Spam\" meat on the pizza. This was on the layer underneath the cheese. It was pink and according to the description was beef however it was pink in colour and really just processed meat but something that I've never seen before. The ground beef was minimal and so hard that I felt it was dried and almost a herb.  And the \"salami\" was hot dogs. The appetizer ash reshteh was not fresh. It was reheated in a microwave and had minimal \"kashk\" sauce on it. The food quality was very low and poor quality. For $15.00 you can get a lot better with real and fresh ingredients.  On top of this, the bathrooms were disgusting. They were on the bottom floor and the soap dispenser did not work. This place needs major work and I suggest you save your money and your time and go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised why there aren't any updated reviews of this place. I discovered this place ages ago when I went to high school. I think I had a bandari sandwich which blew my mind (think a big spicy Italian sausage and potato chunks in a bun). Ok, I didn't mean to sound dirty you pervs! lol anyway, after being away from Toronto for a few years I came back and realized this place has completely changed. You still park in the goonies lot at the back of the store and if you enter through their back door you're automatically exposed to a strong burning smell. (Not a good feeling!) I suggest you enter through their main door on Yonge street to avoid this experience.   The place however, looks more like a restaurant that I actually want to spend some time in. They have a tiny screen at each booth and there's a huge screen on the wall. I like how you can change the channels while sitting at the booth.There's about 6 booths in total and long counter in the centre and some tables I believe. Their pizza is unique in a sense that the crust is thick and filled with toppings and sauce. It's how they make pizza in Iran. The salad portion is huge, so is their fries portion.  I usually end up taking half of my pizza home. My absolute favourite food is their Hamburger and mushrooms. They also do delivery. The staff has generally been very pleasant. They play all sorts of music from Turkish to Persian to English pop to Arabic."}
{"text":"Service was good. The sausage dip app was not good. I was going to order the eggplant one but last minute changed my mind. Wish I didn't as I assume eggplant one would be better. The sausage tasted basically like cheap hot dogs.   On the other hand the kebabs dish (ordered the chicken and beef one) was good. Good, not great / mind blowing. I enjoyed it and definitely reasonably priced.   I would go again but I'd skip the sausage dip. Also I'd like to try their shisha next time around."}
{"text":"Lucky for us our Iranian friend knew exactly what to order and he could not have got it more right than he did. We all had the signature Rose's Pizza and their Rose Fries and both were absolutely phenomenal. The crust texture was perfect. Light but crisp which held the integrity of the pie together nicely. For the carnivores out there you will appreciate how each bite was loaded with meat and the cheese just oozed out in all the right places. The fries were battered and tossed in the house special Rose sauce. It was an interesting take on a classic giving life to a plate of fries with a bit of a kick. Yelpers get off the Pizza Pizza website, put down the Dominoes takeout menus and come here. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Being a frequent customer of their North York location I decided to try the one close to home. They had literally taken left over rice from other customers and put it in my meal! The portion was so small you could tell they were running out of food. I called them but no one cared to contact me to even apologize! They obviously don't know what customer service is"}
{"text":"I liked the traditional seats they had, but the best thing were the fries the sauce they put over the fries is delicious, I will be back as soon as I can to eat those again. I also had the beef sandwich it was also good   Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Their pizza had yellow kraft singles cheese as their cheese. It was inedible. Ordered delivery and the pizza and fries were so cold and soggy."}
