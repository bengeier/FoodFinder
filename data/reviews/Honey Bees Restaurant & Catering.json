{"text":"Yes this place is a dive so be forewarned.  Honey Bee's has moved a few times over the years and is now located in a little shopping center on the borderline of Penn Hills and Wilkinsburg. The location can be a little sketchy at night. It is a pretty ghetto take out only spot so you will be getting your food to go when you visit. One time I ask for a takeout menu and the women behind the counter told me to take a picture of the menu on the wall! Really?   The main attraction here is the fried chicken wings which most of the time are hit or miss. The last few times I had them they just weren't any good. They were lacking flavor and were just too small and made me will like I was eating a baby pigeon. They do offer burgers, salads, sandwiches and hoagies as well but I have never tried them.  The sides are the only saving grace for this place. They offer the usual suspects, mac n cheese, greens, green beans, potato salad and more. The last few times I've gotten my chicken elsewhere and just came here for the sides.  As others have said the place is in desperate need of the Restaurant Makeover treatment.  It just breaks my heart that Pittsburgh doesn't have one really nice sit down Soul Food restaurant where you can get a wide variety of things. You have to go one place for ribs and another of fried chicken and yet another for sides. Yes, there's Carmi which is very good but their menu is lacking. And there's Savoy, but at those high prices I don't consider that to be soul food.   When I have a taste for wings I'll just go to the nearby Genuine Pub or to Mohan's as they are both superior in every way and just get my sides for either Showcase BBQ or Honey Bees."}
{"text":"Loved those wings. Nice size too. We both enjoyed them. Thanks HoneyBees your skills are better than most know about. Yummy for my Tummy"}
{"text":"The Wings are outstanding and the sides are good too! The place may not be fancy but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Ehh, chicken was ok, nothing special. Just another chicken and sub spot located in the shopping plaza of east hills across from Giant Eagle.   They have the menu posted on the wall large enough for anyone to see but the inside looks horrible. The floor is tore up showing the very guck left behind from when you tear up vinyl or tile and the trowel marks are left there. They have a sign saying excuse our mess we are in the middle of remodeling but ECK!!   Most of their informatory signs are written on Neon poster board in Permanent marker. Not quite a professional place a business. The cashier behind the counter was wearing a hair cap that's only suppose to be used before bed and not as an appropriate fashion symbol. If people can't dress appropriately at their job then i'm not interested in a nothing they have to sell. There was no seating either, standing room only!   I only went here to buy some food for a relative but I won't be coming back on my own. i have no reason to and honestly would not want to."}
