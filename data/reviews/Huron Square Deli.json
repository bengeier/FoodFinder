{"text":"It was open on Sunday early morning!
Very old school interior, great service and very fast. I had a breakfast sandwich, here done as a grilled cheese with fluffy omelette and halved sausage links. Pretty darned tasty. Basic food, but pretty good for the only thing open in downtown"}
{"text":"I went to Huron Square Deli for breakfast on a Saturday, and it had the feel of a small old-school diner: cheap, quick, and to-the-point.

The majority of the customers at the counter were middle-aged men with newspapers, and there were a few couples at tables.  The \"kitchen\" was directly behind the deli counter, which enabled customers to see exactly what was going on with their food.  The service staff was only one woman, who simultaneously called orders to her kitchen staff while attending to all of the tables.  She moved quickly and was surprisingly effective despite the skeleton crew.

The menu was extremely inexpensive, and had all of the American breakfast basics.  You could probably eat a full breakfast for under $5.00 if you played it right, but we ordered western omelets that came with hash browns (the shredded potato kind) and a choice of white, wheat, or rye toast.   My huband ordered a strawberry-banana smoothie, which turned out to be super sugary, and a side of corned-beef hash.  When it arrived, it was the type that comes out of a can for sure.

If you're looking for a fast, cheap, down-to-business kind of experience, this is a great little place.  If you have high expectations about ambiance or gourmet quality food, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Greasy food. Extremely limited vegetarian options and only two vegan options on the menu (toast and a veggie wrap). Overall, a forgettable dining experience."}
{"text":"OMFG! This is it! This is what I have been searching for, for the past 3.5 years in Cleveland! I have found it. I have found the Gold Star Diner of Cleveland!! (those of you from Massachusetts, and specifically Worcester, MA know what I am talking about)

Let's get one thing straight - there is a BIG difference between a breakfast place and a good down to earth diner. Just because a place calls itself a diner doesn't mean it is one - there are a few key characteristics it has to meet to really fit the bill.

1) Solidly good food - They make eggs. They make bacon. They make Hash Browns. They make Corned Beef Hash. They make Pancakes. And they do it all without F*****g it all up. Check.

2) Price - They make these said eggs and toast and serve them to you without leaving a hole in your wallet. CHECK. (2.65 breaka speacial if you show up before 9....)

3) Unpretentiousness - You order, and you get your food. You want a substitution? You got it. You want to be an ass? You get shown the door. Meals are not qualified by lengthy stories of the heritage of chicken wherin your eggs came from. Good service, good food, without the slightest bit of pretense. Check

Now if I could only figure out to way to convince them to move closer to W9th....."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank Ed T. for introducing me to this lunch counter. If the Cleve wants to stay an important American city, then it must retain a gem like the Huron Square Deli. I can't imagine New York if all the little corner diners closed up. Forget what the first guy said about the joint lacking veggie options. Only an idiot would come to a greasy spoon lunch counter in a downtown spot tucked between a rape alley and bum's hideaway and expect vegan options. Although they get dinged a star for not having public restrooms, I sort of think it adds to the character. This spot is all about being an old school short order diner. It's about speed and getting the job done. 

There's no Dr. Pepper so don't ask: the waitress doesn't think it's funny if you seem disappointed about that. Again, that just seems to add to its charm. A diner like this needs a server who's all smiles until you start being a drama queen--then, and only then,  the piss and vinegar shows up.

They serve krinkle fries, but good krinkle fries; they don't taste frozen or dry. I think hey might be the only krinkle fries in the city I have ever liked. Well done, Ed T. and Huron Square Deli!"}
{"text":"I had no idea I worked a block away from this place for 6 years. I'm somewhat of a corned beef aficionado and I make it a point to try it at every place I stop. This is pretty damn good. Grilled rye, juicy meat, all u can ask for. Could be a little bigger but great for the price."}
{"text":"great prices.

tasty breakfast.

lunch is yummerz.

cheerful waitstaff.

the cook is nonstop flipping out."}
{"text":"Ate at this place after struggling to find an open breakfast place on a Sunday morning in downtown Cleveland.  Its a small dive kind of place but the food was satisfying and good.  Bacon, sausage, eggs, and hashbrowns all delicious and cooked on the flattop behind the counter and row of stools.

Definitely recommended on a weekend morning when staying in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I just moved to Cleveland from California so I'm busy trying the local food. I ordered the fish sandwich with frys to go. Terrible.. thin, dry fish. Will not return. They need to go to Mcdonald's and try to to better than the fish fillet."}
{"text":"I am a huge breakfast-food fan.  One of my favorite meals of all time is bacon and eggs with toast or grits on the side.  After A Cafe closed up, I was at a loss for where I could pick up a good breakfast-food lunch nearby.  I am happy to say that Huron Square Deli has filled that gap marvelously.  This is a no nonsense, no-frills kind of place.  It's small and located in a dingy building but inside the restaurant, it's clean and well operated.  Pickup service was good, even if the pickup estimate was a little optimistic.  My eggs were cooked extremely well.  Often when you order eggs \"over hard\", the cook simply kills the eggs to death and they come out tough and dry.  My eggs today were excellent, all of the yolk was completely solid but the white was still soft and spongy as it should be.  The bacon also was especially good, nice thick strips that were well cooked and extremely tasty.  I will definitely be back for more breakfast-food lunches.  This is about to become one of my regular lunch stops."}
{"text":"II have a customer right around the corner so this is a convenient cheap spot for lunch. Hey it's greasy spoon type of place, don't get your expectations set too high. 

I enjoy the breakfast for lunch- 2 eggs,3sausage links, toast, hash browns & coffee for $5.90....and you watch the owner/grill cook make it right in front of you if you sit at the counter. ..if he drops your sausage on the floor, there is no way it's ending up on the plate. 

And always a copy of the PD available to read on the counter. 

Pretty hard to screw up eggs over easy, I've never had a bad meal here...or a really great meal either. It is what it is. 
The staff is always very friendly and efficient, place is packed during lunch rush. can't give a BR report never ventured there."}
{"text":"Good greasy spoon in downtown.

Had pancakes, hash browns and water for $5.  They were very tasty and affordable.

Place isn't the fanciest, and they do not have a bathroom, they suggest you go across the street to a hotel."}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for a wedding and we were staying a short distance away. The hotel had a breakfast but it was $15 a person, uh no thanks. We googled Huron Square Deli and found it was within walking distance. 
It a small deli with an old New York style feel. The menu was basic breakfast food, but it was breakfast food well done! I had potatoes, eggs, toast, and ham. All very good! If you're looking for a fancy breakfast place with gourmet, first of their kind, whatever, this isn't your place. If you are looking to feed a family of 5 for under $20, this is your place. 

Lastly, the staff were so nice! They made accommodations on the menu for us when we wanted to substitute something, got us coffee to go without even asking, and helped us figure out the trolley (since that is the one thing my nephew wanted to do). 

If I'm ever back in Cleveland looking for a breakfast on a budget, I will 100% stop in!"}
{"text":"I was wanting a quick simple breakfast, although the woman who was taking orders was nice and as helpful as possible the guy cooking the food wasn't. Actually he was quite annoying. Messing up orders and yapping off to the staff. It took about 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee.. I didn't even eat, my order was nowhere close to being done so after 30 mins of sitting there without a refill of coffee I just left. I had to return my rental car and had to leave.. I left the waitress 10 bucks for her troubles.. I don't plan on returning"}
{"text":"The Huron Square Deli is a great place if you are in need of a quick breakfast fix.  The food is good and greasy for a little hangover relief on your way into work, not that I would need that or anything.....  

The place is small, but the use of space is maximized for a good amount of seating and the food is prepared quickly..  The lack of a restroom is the only negative or I would have given it a 4 star rating.  

The best thing is, it is open on Sunday mornings which is unheard of for downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you want to find service that befits a prison. Waitress asked me to repeat my order three times, forgot half my food, when I did get it it was cold and then I was refused replacement food by the cook because the \"grill was full.\"

Not great food to begin with but add in the remarkably poor service and I'll take my business to phuel cafe down the street."}
{"text":"Four stars cause this place executes what it offers extremely well. This place embodies Cleveland blue collar spirit, with no frills diner fair. It took much discipline to pass on the hash browns, tem was some sexy looking hash browns.

If your staying downtown this is the perfect cure for a hangover or morning munchies, I'm talking to you PW."}
{"text":"I am not sure what I can write about this place but I feel the need to express it so here goes nothing. 
Here is a bit of background information for the sake of this review. I LOVE BREAKFAST FOOD and I am a sucker for hole-in-the-wall kind of places. They tend to be a gem and offer really great dishes. What I love most is that these kind of places never lack personality. Well, this place left me speechless (or would it be fingerless in this situation...after all I am writing). 
A fellow yelper/friend suggested the place. He really set the bar high as he said is the best place in CLE. Hm...thats not the adjective I would use. We go in and I am not sure what happened. The decor was confusing. It had a old dinner like decor but thats it. It needed a thorough cleaning as it looked like nobody dusted or fixed around for about 30 years. The service was good and the food was ok, completely forgettable though. The good thing about it was cheap.  So maybe I can fogive the cold hash browns. It was a \"get what you pay for\" kind of a deal. 
Well...do I blame my friend for the deceiving suggestion and review? No. (To each his own I say) Am I going to return? You guessed....nope...I shall stick with the dinner on clifton,  where I can get a better breakfast for just a dollar or two more."}
{"text":"Quick, not too greasy, delicious eggs, loved this place.  Staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Perfect hole-in-the-wall place.  Was attending an event at the Wyndham across the way so just kind of stumbled upon it, but ended up eating here twice in one weekend!  Perfect spot for a quick, cheap breakfast or lunch.  I had the corned beef hash which was perfect!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, no frills place to grab breakfast.  It's very cheap, and the food isn't half bad.  The coffee is just about awful, but that's to be expected at this kind of diner.  The staff is friendly, and you feel welcome.

It closes early (4pm), so don't come here looking for dinner or anything after a late night of drinking."}
{"text":"Decided to try this greasy spoon as it was right near my offices. HUGE MISTAKE. The place was packed (but only because it's the size of a bathroom), but we were able to place our order and give payment promptly. After 35 minutes of waiting (my lunch break is an hour), I finally decided to flag the cashier and ask what was taking so long. 

Well, turns out that our food had been sitting behind the very same cashier that took our order for over 30 minutes! With 5 mins left to eat, my girlfriend and I decided to sit down at an open table to quickly shove their mediocre at best food down before returning to work. A guy who I will assume is the owner walks over and tells us that we cannot sit at a table with to-go food. 

You must be kidding me? Now normally, I would completely understand, but if your customer paid and waited that long for food that was clearly the restaurants fault, wouldn't you make an exception or show at least a sentiment of apology?

Instead, the owner simply says \"i dont care\" and gives a proverbial *f*** off to me\". What kind of person does that to a paying customer? I worked in the restaurant industry for several years when I was younger and I've never experienced a manager or owner treating a customer that way.

There are plenty of other food options around Playhouse Square so trust me when I say, I will NEVER return to this hole in the wall diner again."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall deli has become one of my default eating spots while studying down the street at Le CSU. Good food, great prices, typically friendly folks (unless they're busy, then don't try talking to anyone more than is necessary to order). 

Only complaint is that whenever I eat in, I leave smelling like butter somehow."}
{"text":"Huron's was conveniently right across the street from where I was staying,  and it was snowing so I didn't want to walk terribly far. I walked in and  beheld a pretty typical diner layout,  with very laid back atmosphere which was good considering I was wearing nothing but sweatclothes.

I ordered the three egg omlette (big, hot, tasty), hash browns (hit the sweet spot between fried to a crisp and overly soggy), corned beef hash (a little salty but great) and coffee. Everything came very quickly and I finished it almost as fast.

Checkout was a breeze with an iPad and Square reader (they take AmEx) and the employees were personable and responsive - I never saw the bottom of my coffee mug. Prices were extremely reasonable.

Short version, this is how diners should be done."}
{"text":"Bottom line: I would not return. 

I don't know what I did to offend the two people working the counter at Huron Square Deli this morning. Granted, I walked all the way inside the restaurant to make a to-go order, when apparently THERE IS A WINDOW to the right of the door to the restaurant where one makes to-go orders and waits for them. My bad, I didn't see it, and I had never been to this restaurant before so didn't know any better. They were incredibly rude about dismissing me and acting like I was causing them a huge inconvenience by trying to order breakfast at the counter. I was the only customer ordering at that moment, and I believe there were one or two other patrons in the otherwise empty restaurant, so it's not like I was crowding other, seated customers. 

Anyway, they finally deigned to take my order. To their credit, it was only $4.77 for a breakfast sandwich (egg, cheese, and bacon) and a 20 oz iced coffee. The food was only adequate--the bacon was chewy, and the bread was standard white bread. But fine. The coffee seemed like it might have been hot coffee poured over ice--it was VERY watery. 

There is a serious dearth of grab and go breakfast options in this area of Cleveland--but I'd look hard for a different one rather than go to Huron."}
{"text":"If you want breakfast food this is your place to go. No matter what you get it will be hearty and delicious with a good price. Decent lunches too. Great corned beef! Only thing to avoid are the hot dogs.

Staff is nice too, but only really talk to the regulars."}
{"text":"One the THEE BEST vintage diner's in Cleveland. I have been here several times with friends and family and not once have I ever been disappointed. It's appropriately priced for what you'd except of a diner. The waitresses (which it seems they have a high employee turnover) have always been very nice and a diverse group of people. 
The only reason I don't give it a perfect 5/5 review, is that, I'm assuming he may be the owner or just the head chef, can be a bit... rude. Especially to his workers. The kitchen is right out in the front so you'll actually be able to see him cook the food. Now don't get me wrong, I think he can only be rude at times when things aren't working efficiently. He just wants his business to succeed and allow every patron to have a wonderful experience. And that's amazing! It just makes the atmosphere a bit awkward when he's arguing or yelling at an employee. He means very well! After these kinds of interactions I once even saw him apologize to his employee and comfort her. But like I said, it just makes the experience slightly awkward when it does occur (which it doesn't occur too often). 
I highly recommend this place, especially to hungover college students: cheap, near campus, and gets you feeling better!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few times over the years for breakfast. A lot of friends like going to Grumpy's. It is always packed there and I don't think it is even that good. It is just good people watching at Grumpy's. A lot of the hungover crowd goes there. Huron Square Deli is a great breakfast option for anyone in the Tremont, Downtown, or Ohio City areas. There is usually available parking on Prospect. The breakfasts are in the $3 to $4 range. My friends and I all agreed that the server we had last time was one of the sweetest girls with the most easy going disposition. If you are in the mood for some eggs, toast, starch and some meat on any given morning, come here!"}
{"text":"Great Food !!!!
Great Value for the Price
Awesome Staff
Quick and Easy Breakfast, Lunch or before the Game..."}
