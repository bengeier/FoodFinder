{"text":"There was a time when Penn Station subs were huge and had plenty of meat on them. Those days are over.  A few years ago they started making their sub buns much more narrow with much less meat on them, yet they continue to raise their prices. I used to feel full after eating a six or eight inch sub from here, but now I am still hungry after eating them, and their monthly special is not a good deal at all. You get a small drink, a tiny 6 inch sub and a tiny portion of french fries that is laughable, and you pay nearly $10 for it. Nowadays they put so little meat on their philly cheesesteak that many bites of it are just a mouth full of bread."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs, offered cold or grilled. The fries are good and plentiful. The cookies are so freaking good!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location to on Friday the food was good however the staff didn't appear to be focused on work. The line appeared really dirty but they basically walked off to sit in the dinning room and talk about all sorts of things and the fact that I had my kids with me it was really disturbing to here their conversation. Overall not a terrible experience but the employees should understand it is a time a place for everything."}
{"text":"True story: I was one of the first employees at this place. In high school, my friends and I were packed into a car stopped at a red light on Detroit. I look over at the car next to us and say, \"what's up\" to the driver. He asks if we want jobs. We did, so we followed him to the still-under-construction Penn Station. It pays to talk to people at red lights.

Little did we know we were launching the best chain sub sandwich restaurant ever. Everything is delicious - from the buttered bread, to the real ingredients, to the fresh cut fries. But unless you want to die young, don't eat more than one per week."}
{"text":"You guys really need to change your online hours! Your door says 9pm weekdays but online says 10pm"}
{"text":"Worst Philly sub ever. It was an onion sandwich. I have never seen so many onions on a sub. They had it reverse. It was all onions, cheese and bread. The meat was so tiny I couldn't pick it up with a fork. I could not tell you how the meat tasted. I got an order of fries and they were covered in so much salt you could not eat them. Headed to target now for tums!!"}
{"text":"This place is great I always love coming here the service is so friendly and my food is always delicious.

The location is a bit off I noticed that there is another listing for the same restaurant that is actually where it is located.  Yelp get it together."}
{"text":"Chain restaurants aren't usually among my favorite places to find the best food in town, but in this case, Penn Street Station qualifies.  In the never ending search to find a good Philly outside of Philly, I found one at Penn Street.  The bread/meat ratio is good, the sandwich is moist but no too much so, and the cheese is stringy.  This sandwich is just satisfying. 

The restaurant is pretty basic, but it is clean and the customer service is good.  When you walk in the door the guys behind the counter usually greet you and after you order your sandwich they bring it out to you. 

Finally the French Fries are as good as you will find.  Add some catchup and malt vinegar to your fries and it rounds out your meal nicely."}
{"text":"Great subs and fries.  The people that work there are nice but in 5-6 trips they have screwed up my order 3 times.  I'm not talking forgot to add mushrooms, but giving me the entire wrong order.  Get a 6\" steak instead of a 10\" chicken or an Italian sub instead of sausage. 

They have made up for in most instances and that is why they get three stars, but if you go there double check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Perfect! I wrote a review for the steel creek location and it was just an awful experience. Park rd was awesome! They listened, my food was great and done just as I wanted, and they gave me great customer service! What more could I want :-)"}
{"text":"This was my first penn station visit, and I'm disappointed. I was excited until I returned home to find out my order is completely wrong. I told them what I \"only\" wanted, but they felt the need to add THREE additional ingredients. I'm not able to say its a good sub considering two of the added ingredients I don't like and there's too many to pick out, smh."}
{"text":"The service is great here! Sonny greeted us with a genuine smile, pointed out that we could save by using a special, happily let us change sizes, brought us our food - again with a great smile, and gave us a bag for leftovers. 
I loves my chicken salad sub that Rob made me. My husband wished he had gotten mine, but his chicken teriyaki wasn't bad- it just wasn't a good choice for him. The fries were hot and fresh from the fryer. We love the naturally cut kind like these! Rob did a nice job cooking our food. 
We WANT to come back!! It is so close to our house, we probably will."}
{"text":"A few of us come here at least once a week after work. Always fast and friendly service. The place is always clean and prices are reasonable especially like when they give out free cookie samples. I almost always order the chicken parmegion but also tried tried the Reuben. The name kinda threw me at first being Italian . associated Penn Station with penne pasta don't know why so i thought it was a pasta place. Sandwiches and fresh cut fries are always hot and brought to your table. Free refills on beverages. Will definitely come back again hope you enjoy this place as much as we do."}
{"text":"My wife says it's the best sub she's ever had. She's not hard to please but she's very picky about her food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Penn. The service was GREAT & the food was REALLY good!!!!! I Look forward to trying the fries & lemonade."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite sub joint.  I've tried most, but keep going back to the Italian.  Awesome bread joined up with grilled meats run through the oven with cheese and finally dressed with all the goodies.  Getting hungry just thinking about it.  Awesome home cut fries, good home squeezed lemonade."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant!! Please do NOT go here. I was so shocked to find a place nowadays where the employees touch the bread and food with their own BARE hands, No gloves while making their sandwiches. And in between customers touch the broomstick and anything you can imagine."}
{"text":"Very delicious Philly cheesesteak, maybe a bit more spicy would be better for me~ Anyway a good place to take a sub!"}
{"text":"The floor in this restaurant is so wet right now the employees are trying big not to fall and I am afraid to walk to the station to get my fountain drinks. Dangerous for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the customer service leaves something to be desired. The workers are rude and aloof. They carry on as if no customers are even there."}
{"text":"On a later visit I was able to speak with a manager, who was very apologetic and helpful. I have upgraded my rating to reflect this. Do double-check your order, and if the person on duty is not helpful, ask to be contacted by a manager; they seem interested in improving service and making things right.

On the plus side: great fries."}
{"text":"Very slow service. We came in at 7pm with only 4 other patrons in the place. The employees were not rude but not polite.  We waited far too long for two subs.  We did both get grilled subs but there was no pep in their step. The subs were average. If you are in any rush or time crunch I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Worst Penn Station ever....employees regularly handle meat with their bare hands....soo gross. Will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Never again! Watched some 16 year old with blisters all over his face handle my artichokes and cheese with NO GLOVES.  WEAR GLOVES"}
{"text":"Amazing tuna salad on equally amazing baguette! Happy I found this place by accident. Definitely stop in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"What can I say...I love the chicken pharm sandwich at this joint and the fries are always good as well."}
{"text":"I can't really believe I've writing a review about a chain sub shop...I'm hoping none of my Philly friends see...but the hot artichoke sandwich at Penn Station East Coast Subs is a game changer. The herb mix they use with the (optional) sauteed mushrooms and artichoke hearts is great Their fresh cut fries are really tasty. The fresh squeezed lemonade is awesome. The manager brought around free hot-from-the-oven chocolate chunk cookies. It helps that Penn Station East Coast Subs is a really convenient place to stop in while running errands."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite on my way to somewhere else. Had a grilled turkey Dagwood that was actually much better than I expected. They're new and still getting their act together but in terms of faster food choices this is a good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time to try Penn Station, they cut the fries there and came out crispy.   

Had the 8\" chicken parmesan, apparently the bread is baked to finish at the time of purchase. 

Left full but the chicken quality itself wasn't impressive but will be back for the fries and another hot sub option."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesesteak, fries and lemonade. The establishment is very clean, unlike most quick casual restaurants these days. The staff seemed very friendly as well. They welcome me as I entered the place, checked on me as I was eating, picked up my basket after I was done, and thanked me by my first name as I exited. Really impressed."}
{"text":"Very inviting place, Eric ( the manager I think ) was very engaging with the group I was with. He seemed to recognize a majority of the customers that came in during our time there. The food was really good, had the club which was suggested by the young lady, my co-workers had the cheesesteak which they suggested I get upon our next visit."}
{"text":"Clean location! Very friendly staff, ask for Sean! Had the steak sub, fresh-cut fries and a tea. They came out and checked to see how everything was."}
{"text":"Service, food and lemonade were all excellent!! Had the Philly cheesesteak and fries. The lemonade was the perfect blend. Enjoyed our meal!!"}
{"text":"Great service, waited on immediately entering the restaurant w very friendly staff. Ordered the pizza sub, fries, drink. Food came out fast n piping hot.  Great flavor but could use a lil more meat on the sandwich."}
{"text":"I go to Penn Station for the Grilled Artichoke -- I've never had a sub like that at a chain anywhere else.  The fresh fries and lemonade are really good too.  The place is always clean, and the staff is efficient and friendly.  I've never had to wait long for an order, even a big one, and the complimentary newspapers and TV help pass the time.  

When I last visited and was placing a big order, I did notice something a little strange: on their menu, it's less expensive to order two six inch sandwiches rather than one 12 inch sandwich.  Just a tip, in case you're ordering in bulk.

My only complaint is that sometimes my food has come out a little greasy.  Perhaps it's just too hot off the grill."}
{"text":"Third review in and I know someone's going to think I'm too generous lol! But no honestly, Penn Station is a definite stop in anytime I'm home on vacation! I looove their chicken philly sandwich! The workers are friendly, clean environment, nice place to catch the game and satisfy your hunger! They ((even)) offer you peppermints when you're done with those savory sandwiches!! How considerate lol! Not one bad experience yet... I appreciate them repeating your order twice before charging. So, if your order comes out wrong, they gave you more than enough times to correct them. PS: Don't forget to drench your fresh fries in vinegar and ketchup! Mmm!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I'm crazy.  Most people don't seem to be big fans of Penn Station, but I'm pretty hooked.  I've been here several times the past few months, each time with someone new, and they've all really enjoyed their subs.

I almost always go with their cheesesteak (which has various sizes from 6, 8, and 10 inches).  I think it's a very solid and tasty cheesesteak.  Fresh ingredients?  I don't know. Canned? Perhaps.  Franchise-owned?  So what.  It just hits the spot.

My friends have tried the Chicken Cordon Blu, and she won't try anything else.  My other has tried the Reuben, and refuses to try another sub.  So I guess you can say they're all pretty happy.  My other friends have all stuck with the cheesesteak.  One even uttered, \"Wow, this has to be one of the best cheesesteaks I've had in a long time.\"

And let's be honest, this place isn't on Weight Watchers Top Ten places to eat.  But, since it's next to Supercuts, you can just get a haircut afterwards, and it'll make you look thinner."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sandwich place. The price is a little high, but you definitely get what you pay for. The sandwiches are loaded with meat and are always incredible. With all the sandwich shops in town I will pick this one every time!"}
{"text":"These people that work here look like they hate their life, Not friendly at all. Tables are dirty. They couldn't even get the name right for the order. Also they messed up on a sandwich. I would not recommend this location at all."}
{"text":"This is the only Penn Station I love coming too! Customer Service is always great! I live closer to another Penn Station but this one is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Staff 5 star. So nice and helpful. Food 5 star. Location 5 star. There is nothing not to love about it. Great lunch or dinner. A regular on my rotation."}
{"text":"Not impressed with their Philly cheesesteak. The steak was thick and kinda chewy. Fries are awesome though. Kid that took my order was kinda rude too. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"A couple reviews mentioned potentially unsanitary conditions at PS.  I looked up their recent County Inspection Report.  Some of the \"critical\" violations included: (1) employees touching ready to eat food with their bare hands; (2) some food (e.g., meat) not being properly refrigerated; and (3) not marking how long food was left in the refrigerator.   

Gross."}
{"text":"why doesnt anyone wear gloves? i never saw any of the 3 employees go to the sink to wash thier hands. i watched an employee take an order (touch the computer, and touch the credit card) then immediately  turn around and start touching food to cook. i confronted an employee on the matter and he told me that there is sanitizer under the counter... wouldnt you have to bend down to use it?  as im speaking about this another employee tries to hand me a paper written by the general manager. what does that prove to me? i work in service  industry, i know health code."}
{"text":"Best fast food italian hoagie I've ever had. Leagues better than subway and even better than Quiznos!! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food is tasty.  But, the downtown location really has issues.  There were four errors on my order today.  The first two were related to the ordering process, requiring that my order be  entered a total of three times.  At the other end of the prep line, I find that they've botched the order anyway, and have to re-make the sandwich.  Despite having already waited almost 10 minutes for my food, my \"corrected\" order was put at the back of the food prep queue.  So, I waited another 5-7 minutes for my order.  Since my order was for the \"special of the day\" I did not expect such difficulty in filling the order.  Then when they call my name and hand me my sandwich, we have to have a discussion about whether or not I ordered the \"deal\" with fries and a drink.  Despite having the proof of what I paid for on the receipt in my hand, I was told by two employees that I had ordered a sandwich only.  Really?  After all that waiting I have to argue about my order?  I won't be back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"Usually not much of a sub person. I was on a hurry and haven't had breakfast or lunch and found myself in front of Penn Station for the first time.

I came in and immediately noticed the quality of service - these guys mean business. They're not your typical \"Hi, my name is sunshine let me know what I can do for you\" (on second thought that's probably more of a strippers name ;-), but are dedicated to providing you with the service you deserve yet serving everyone in line in an efficient and effective manner. I much prefer that approach to the standard \"service lines\" you often get without much to back it up. 

I ordered the Chicken Parmesan sub and took it back to my car leaving towards the highway. Little did I know that these types of sandwiches are probably not the best to eat doing 75 mph with your work clothes on...

Long story short: Awesome sandwich, absolutely loved it, but when I got to my destination in Cary, NC needed to make a quick stop at the mall before my meeting and buy a new shirt ;-)"}
{"text":"Subs are really good and fries are one of my favorite French fries anywhere. Wished service was better. Last two visits we watched several people very upset with service-4 out of 6 0ne visit and two on another. Our food took too long for a fast food place but luckily we were not in a rush. Management is obviously lacking in experience. No coordinated prep of food -order taking-delivery. Multiple mistakes on orders. Hope they work things out or they will be out of business by next year. Would hate to see that happen."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal. The staff are well trained and even seem to be having fun while working. Great job!"}
{"text":"Best sub i ever had- got the Dagwood which has 5 kinds of meets, you can choose from myriad of items,  had spices , not alot of bread ,very tasty, it was best sub I ever had period. Help was very nice, Novi location"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness I had an excellent sandwich from this place it was an Italian and it was so good"}
{"text":"First time! Just what the doctor ordered. Built my own artichoke and sausage sub. Hot, melted cheese and mushrooms complimented a very tasty sandwich. Fresh cut fries available here, too."}
{"text":"Penn Station has great food, and the prices are pretty reasonable (but definatly on the higher-end). Every time that I eat here, I get a Philly Cheesesteak, fries, and a fresh-squeezed lemonade. The quality of the food is very high, and is 100% consistant every single time that I eat here. I have never had a bad meal here, and have never had any issues (other than the prices, which are somewhat high compared to other fast food restaurants). Overall, Penn Station is a great place to eat, and if you like Philly Cheesesteaks, they have one of the best that I've ever had, so it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this location!  The customer service is spot on, the bread is by far, the best sub bread I'ver ever had, the french fries are delicious & for dessert, you can't go wrong with their yummy chocolate chunk cookies.  My 8-year-old asks if he can eat there everyday."}
{"text":"I Love Penn Station Subs.  They truly are the best in town.  Go see Tom off Providence rd and 485. They have great monthly combo specials and consistent taste."}
{"text":"Delicious subs and amazing fries!! I have been going here for lunch roughly once a week since they opened and I have ALWAYS experienced great service and awesome food. The subs and fries are always hot and fresh to order and the bread they use for the subs is soft yet crunchy, so yummy! When your craving a delicious sub and fries (how many sub places do you know that serve FRIES instead of chips) stop by Penn Station you won't be disappointed!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were really good.  We had the cheesesteak and Italian. Both were very tasty.  Fries were great and we tried fresh squeezed lemonade and it was also very good. But I got to say a guy named Chris was so very nice and helpful.  Not sure if he was the manager but he made us laugh and could not have been nicer.  It took less than 10 minutes to get our order"}
{"text":"Everyone makes mistakes.  It is how we deal with those mistakes that determines our success.  We went as a party of six, on one check.  Five of our meals came quickly and were of decent quality.  The sixth meal was not received until 29 minutes later.  During that time we repeatedly asked about the missing order, and were initially told \"it should be on it's way.\" The staff seemingly took no effort to find out what the problem was.  Only after repeated queries did they decide to look for our order printout, verify that we had paid for that meal, then start trying to get it made.  IF SOMEONE SAYS THEY ARE MISSING THEIR MEAL, GET IT IN PROCESS, THEN VERIFY PAYMENT, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!!  After everyone was finished, we still had to wait for the last meal, and get it as take-out, so the rest of us could get back to work. 

As a side note, there are NO SALADS on the menu.  They did make me a salad as a special request, and it was very poor.  My meal was received quickly. I am not sure what it cost (our copy of the receipt was not itemized) our party of six was $64.00.  

You can eat way better food and have better service for that price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. They totally messed up my order and after waiting 36 minutes never offered an apology. Do not go here."}
{"text":"It's convenient, yummy and clean....We live at Silos South End.   My husband and I share the 10\" club and medium fries and it is delish."}
{"text":"Awful. Completely agree with the other reviewers. Poor service and even worse food. I am pretty sure the gas station next door has better quality sandwiches than this place (the neighboring Dunkin Donuts certainly does).

For $7-8 you get a sandwich role that is skinnier than a baguette with almost no meat/filling. Oh, and on top of everything, the place has a 95 sanitation rating! One of the worst restaurant ratings I have seen since I moved down to North Carolina. 

So bottom line; you will likely get poor service, poor quality food, and, as a kicker, you might also get food poisoning due to poor sanitation. No thanks!!"}
{"text":"I went to Penn Station for the first time Yesterday. I frequent this shopping mall a lot, but somehow this sub shop has manage to stay hidden from me (until yesterday). I must say the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the philly Cheesesteak with everything except the pizza sauce. It was amazing, and their bread is awesome! The fries was just as good, freshly cut and hot out the fryer. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was staying nearby, and after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did as it was a pleasant surprise.  Very fast and friendly staff.  The place was nice and clean.  

I had the cheesesteak, and while it was not as good as the real thing hot off the grill in Philly, it was very good in its own way.  Don't get me wrong, it was really really good.  I also had the fries, which are cooked in peanut oil, and while I asked for ketchup, I never even used it as they were very tasty all by themselves. 

I would certainly go back again and again."}
{"text":"Do you want a real cheese steak sandwich? Great service, fantastic subs, and amazing lemonade. 10100101010101× better than subway or Jimmy John's"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  Best sub I've ever had. My son-in-law turned me on to this place one Sunday after working all morning building a fence.

I had the best Philly Cheese Steak ever (although I've never been to Philly). I'm pretty sure it's the best you could find in Charlotte. Come to think of it, I have never seen a Philly Cheese Steak on other sub shop menus - And granted, I was starving that Sunday afternoon, and would have probably eaten a bologna sandwich on white bread. So, just to be sure, I've been back a few times since and every time enjoyed the subs.

If you've never been there, give it a try. You'll love it. They make the subs to order, hot or cold, a large selection of meats, cheeses and toppings, unlike other sub shops.  And the price is right.

Just writing this review is making me hungry. See you at Penn Station."}
{"text":"Firstly ,I would love if they wore gloves. Second, the last time I was there the man preparing the food was doing multiple things. Unfortunately I didn't catch him before making my sandwich, cause apparently grabbing the broom, phone, and etc wasn't means to stop and wash your dirty hands. It kills me how much people just don't care because they are not the ones eating the food so therefore they take less precaution and people like that should be fired and not allowed to work in a food place establishment."}
{"text":"Lucky I am giving this place 1 star. Ordered a sub a long time ago and asked for no onions because my wife doesn't eat them. Well we got home and the sub had onions in it. We called and they said we would be in a book for a complementary sub. We moved away and were in the area months later and decided to come in and get the sub. They didn't have our names, and the associate half accused me of cheating the system. Needless to say I walked out and will never come back again."}
{"text":"Penn Station is my all time favorite place to get a sub. I drive 45 minutes just to get these each time!!! The bread is always fresh and soft, the fries are cut fresh, the lemonade is squeezed there and the COOKIES ARE AMAZING!!! Worth the drive no matter how far it is!! They are pretty quick and the prices are great. The meat is always fresh as well."}
{"text":"This place is quite good. Not much to add as the previous reviewers summarized things well. The fresh cut fries & lemonade are good. I like the Italian however the Philly seems to be the \"signature\". Prepare for very greasy - but tasty - food. Location is pretty convenient as was already mentioned. Don't waste your time at the hoity-toity place two doors down."}
{"text":"I used to visit them in other cities when I traveled,  so I was very excited to finally get one close to home.  I was there the first day and got the cheese steak.  The service was great,  management was there apologizing for delays but I really didn't think it took too long, especially for the first day.  All employees were extremely friendly and the sandwich was awesome!   Love the buns and the fries were great too.    Went back yesterday and had the reubin and fries.   Again,  I was not disappointed in the service,  friendliness of staff and the reubin was very good.   Prices are reasonable,  and less when compared to some other similar places.   Welcome to the area,  very glad to have them here."}
{"text":"First off, I ordered from the Cold Deli Classics section and I got a hot tuna with melted cheese. Was told I should have ordered it special. I guess I should have known they run their cold sandwiches thru the toaster. Took 20 minutes for a sub and I was first in line. 
Here's a hint don't toast your cold items and they'll be done faster."}
{"text":"Everything was great until I got a super long black hair cooked into my sandwich as I already ate more than half highly upset! I called to let them know the lady  just says oh ok we will just remake it no apologies the best thing going was the nice girl who took my order she has great customer service skills. Also there was a guy working there who came from a brake outside and just use a squirt of hand sanitizer and began cooking food eeewww gross his hands should have been washed with soap and water who knows what he was doing outside . As much as I love penn station this one gets thumbs down I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered my sub... the kid working the cash register took it to another customer by mistake.  She brought it back up to the counter and said, \"I asked for no onions, and no mushrooms...\", the kid said, \"we can remake it for you...\".  He then took the that sub into the back room (not the area where they make the sandwiches).  He then asked the cook to make the other customer's sub... the cook said, \"it's right here...\", he took the woman her sub and then went into the back room got the original sub and brought it to me.  I watched the whole thing go down, and I confronted him about it... he said, \"no, ahhh... let me... we can remake it for you...\"

I walked out... didn't even ask for my money back... disgusted!  WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was top notch! We wanted half of our sandwiches to go and they kept it in the oven so it would be warm while we ate the other half in the store. The chicken teriyaki sandwich tastes just like French onion soup. I've never had such a unique sub!"}
{"text":"Since they moved from the Park Rd location, this place has really gone downhill. Not sure if it's related to a management change, or what the reason, but service here has really gotten poor.
The last two times I phoned in an order, I was rushed as if I were somehow in the way of their other business/customers. Tip: I'm also a customer - actually more than one since I usually order for my whole team at work. They haven't gotten a single special order right in the last two visits - something as simple as 'no mayo' seems like a challenge for them.
Also their fries, which used to rival 5 Guys for greatness, always seem to be undercooked these days - by the time they get to our office (5 minutes away) they're a steamed pile of soggy potato-like substance that no amount of malt vinegar will remedy.
I'm not in the business of pitching a 3rd strike to a restaurant, 'fool me twice' and all that.
I won't be back."}
{"text":"Who the hell puts mayo on an Italian sub!  I ordered it to eat in the car and realized they put mayo on it.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Subs r ok defiantly not the best.  Little pricey also for what you get. Service is ok and are little ghetto here."}
{"text":"Looking to ruin your diet on the way home from work cause you're too lazy to cook dinner?  Look no further than the delicious sandwiches Penn Station can provide you with!"}
{"text":"I love penn station! I live nearby this one and go here a lot. Everyone working is always very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Nice sub place.  

I'm a fan of the club w/o cheese.  

Good price, service has been quick and subs toasted subs are better than most.

(They've also never messed up my order a single time in about a dozen visits, so don't fear other comments)"}
{"text":"I love me some penn station. My favorite is the dagwood and fresh cut fries. The staff always goes out of their way to be nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We order wraps for a meeting yesterday. This was an embarrassment and I cannot understand how Penn Sation would deliver such things ... we could not find out  out where the chichen salad or turkey were... just some sort of liquid in the wrap... embarrassing and for sure not tasty.
The explanation from Pen Sation was that wraps were new things for them to do ... but why would they  dare selling such food items  that only damage their brand and upset customers! Just sell what you do best!"}
{"text":"Great quality subs and fries. Really like that the fries are freshly cut all day long."}
{"text":"THE STATE OF THE STATION ADDRESS

    Hello everyone. Tonight I am here to address the Penn Station Nation. 

    All across America, when our great people think about tasty food, they think about Penn Station East Coast Subs. Everyone knows they have the best sandwiches from sea to shining sea. Tonight, I will share my personal story about Penn Station with the country.

    It all started one night at about 9pm. My personal assistant came in and asked me what I wanted for fourth meal. My mind instantly went to Subway, but I then decided I didn't want shitty food. I craved something fresh. I desperately struggled with my decision for many seconds, until my assistant Adam said \"Why not a delicious, juicy, and fresh Philadelphia CheeseSteak from Penn Station East Coast Subs?\" I was delighted to hear this fresh cut suggestion. I jumped up and called for my chopper. 

    About 15 minutes later, I stepped into my helicopter. My best friend Joe was piloting and Michelle was in the back. Before I knew it we had arrived at Penn Station Rocky River. Once I stepped in the door, I was bombarded witha smell like no other. The only way to describe it would be if you could make freshness into a scent. I was kindly greeted by a great looking man that looked like he has never had a booger on his fingers ever in his life. He took my order of a 7\" Chicken Teryaki. I watched my scrumptious sub cooked before my very eyes. I could hardly wait as my sandwich was gently placed into the oven to cook. When the juicy chicken sub emerged from the oven, it looked like angels frolicking in the clouds. I sat patiently as a wonderful stocky man with a backwards cap said the sweet words: \"I have a Teriyaki for Barrack!\". A single tear rolled down my eye as I raised my hand to signal that I was Barrack. My first bite was a sensation I have never felt before. My taste buds exploded in mouth from the sheer flavor. Next I needed to try the Fresh Cut Fries. I quickly grabbed a handful of the long and flash fried Idaho potato. I stuffed them into my mouth and felt that sweet euphoria I thought I'd never feel again. The rest of my visit was the best experience of my life. 

    And that Nation, is my story. I now declare the Philadelphia Cheese Steak from Penn Station to be the national food. Thank you for your time. Goodnight."}
{"text":"Tried there on  Friday at 11:15 AM for 4 subs, never got out of there till noon. Need to pick up the pace and open at least at 10 AM if they want boating traffic..too bad service was so poor, sub was actually decent. I like the bread."}
{"text":"Excellent subs, great fries with a nice friendly staff.
Check them out...try their steak and cheese it's awesome."}
{"text":"I went there a few weeks ago had a veggi it was great..went back yesterday it was terrible got home it was soggy filled with oinons mooosh sandwich I live 8miles away they wanted me to save the sandwich and bring it back for investigation..I threw it away never going back."}
{"text":"Have been here probably a dozen times now and have yet to be disappointed. The 6 inch subs are a LOT of food for me and I am always stuffed. I've tried the Philly cheesesteak, the chicken teriyaki, and the Reuben- all of which are delicious! 

A word to the wise though. . . Don't ever look up the calorie, sodium, or fat content..."}
{"text":"I love the subs at Penn Station. The cheesesteaks are really good if you dont get them with the pizza sauce, I have no idea who thought that was a good idea. I prefer the one in Rock Hill over the one on Providence only because I go there more often and the staff there know what I want . This is not to say that the one on Providence couldn't learn :)."}
{"text":"They said they were out of fries.... but the place is literally decorated with potatoes? The sandwich was made quickly and still tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Super quick, hot, and yummy! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the cashier looking at me with his eyelids barely open....it was too creepy not to mention, but otherwise good experience!"}
{"text":"Well its now Official Penn Station is the BOMB!!!!
My 10 year old Daughter who doesn't eat anything but Chicken Nuggets (basically) has on the record said today \"Dad this is AWESOME\"

I told her we are going to eat at Penn Station, she said DAD they make Subs....... I replied and yes you are going to order and try a sub.

Now I ordered her the Italian....(Which I Love) but to be safe got it totally plain, just meat and cheese!!  Yes I WON  She liked it.
Bless you Penn Station!!!

Fresh cut Fries of course she gobbled those up and had a fresh squeezed Lemonade."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:08pm with a friend of mine and placed our order right away. By the time I paid for our food it was 5:40pm. Our food still wasn't done or ready until 5:50pm. They brought it out and it was all completely wrong. He specifically asked for no onions due to allergies and it had onions. We sent it back and they remade it and it still came back with onions. Also, I didn't even eat my sandwich because I watched THREE different people handle the ONE 6in at separate occasions with bare hands after handling cleaning rags/products and other food. We drank our lemonades and returned the food. We didn't even want the money back. We just wanted the service and food we paid for. Left the refund on the counter and walked out. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Just left there. The 2 gentlemen closing out were in great spirits and service was awesome. Food was hot as hell and served with a smile. I will be coming back and recommending to co workers!! Ps. The Philly Cheesesteak sub is the best!"}
{"text":"For a quick, inexpensive cheesesteak, this place can't be beat. Better than D'Angelos or Jersey Mikes. Fast and friendly. 

Also, homemade French fries. From real potatoes that can be seen from the counter."}
{"text":"Used to love PS. Today I waited 20mins for my order on a tight schedule for lunch. Repeated my order three times actually. Get back to the office and my order is wrong. It's clear to me that your employees don't care too much about this either. Place was slow so there was no need for this."}
{"text":"I have only been to a Penn Station once before (a different location), and at that time I was so impressed and excited that they had an artichoke sandwich on the menu that I really glossed over the rest of the experience.  So I was happy to stop in this past weekend for a quick lunch, but this time I was a bit of a let down.  The artichoke sandwich was still there, but it's really greasy.  I felt very rushed to place my order as soon as I stepped in the door and had a hard time getting the attention of the cashier when I had a question.  They must have noticed my scowl though because more than one worker stopped by our table to ask how we were doing and take away our trash.  Nice save.

Not very kid friendly.  No changing table, and I didn't notice any highchairs."}
{"text":"When you have a hankering for a Steak & Cheese look no further. Honestly their bread is amazing. Give them a try. Fries Please!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. I wanted to save half of my Philly Cheesesteak for later. That was the plan. It really was.

But as I kept eating, I knew all attempts to abort the process would have been futile.

I agree with what others have said about Penn Station restaurants: Very efficient service, great personalities, clean, TVs, newspapers. Despite the fact that it's a chain, I felt as though the employees added a \"special touch\" to dealing with their customers.

I'm going to give four separate ratings for Penn Station:

Sandwich: 4 stars. It was delicious, but there was something a LITTLE bit off with the bread. It was sturdy-ish ... it was definitely good in terms of keeping all the ingredients and the grease at bay, but it wasn't as good as some of the more (ugh, I hate myself for using this word here because I'm not from Philly and don't have all the experience in the world when it comes to cheese steaks) authentic ones I've tried. But still very good. And yes, I ate the whole thing.

Fries: 5 stars ++. DELICIOUS. Soooo freaking good!

Lemonade: 3 stars. It wasn't really for me. Though I did appreciate all of the fresh lemons hanging around.

Service: 5 stars. As mentioned above, it was great.

Now that I've had my Penn Station experience, I think I'm good for another few months or so until I get a craving. Glad I gave it a shot as a result of a fellow yelper's review (thanks, Andrea Z!)"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, very quick service and always polite and efficient when I go there for lunch. Their Italian sub is delicious; and their fries are really good too. Freshly cut from actual potatos! Would recoomend to anyone to give them a try!"}
{"text":"Went back to give this place another try.  I received some off-yelp criticism that I should have tried the Philly Cheesesteak because the \"chicken parm\" I had earlier wasn't a main menu item, and was just in a supporting role.

So off today I went to see if I just made a bad menu choice.

I had a 10\" Philly Cheesesteak and a medium french fry.

So first, the french fries, tasted fine but I got about 25 shorties..... Half of the french fries were about 3/4 of inch long.

Next, the main attraction, the \"winning\" cheesesteak was just not so winning.

Just so I'm clear

The Bread: it's good, has decent crunch, and is fairly flavorful.

The amount of meat: reasonable for the sandwich, but definitely not generous.  The chicken parm had next to no meat on it!

The flavor: This is the where and why that this place just falls flat on its face.  Once again, the predominate flavor of the whole sandwich is \"Grilled Onions.\"  The steak is flavorless, the mushrooms non-existent, the banana peppers ok.  It just ends up tasting like a whole bunch nothing.

I taste grease and onions.  I see no compelling reason to try this again.

The chicken parm and steak tasted almost the same to me.  I almost couldn't tell the difference!  When you start having multiple proteins taste the same, you're doing something wrong!

If you want a decent sandwich, try either Fernando's on Liberty (pretty decent) or Peppi's (even better) on Smithfield towards the bridge.  Fernando's is the closest to PSECS, but Peppi's serves a better sandwich.  Get either the Ultra Cheesesteak or the Blazing Saddle (and see my previous reviews on yelp for both of them!)

Thumbs down PSECS, thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here within the last week. My fiance and I both ordered subs. The service was noticably slow (But I was to expect that, they're toasted and made to order). The issue was the service and the quality of the subs. We both ordered custom made subs. Hers was a veggie sub with a couple things left off of what the normal sandwich comes with. Hers was wrong and had everything on it. Mine was very easy only three ingredients. And maybe you can guess by my rating, only two were on there. It's a joke to me. How hard is it to make a sandwich correctly. There was no one in the restaurant but us. The guy making the sandwhich seemed to be in a horrible mood too, so that added a lot to why our sandwhiches were made incorrectly. So basically, it's very hard for me to understand why someone can't read what needs to be on a sub and do it and check things off. Crazy. This is the third or fourth time this has happened too!

I would blame it on the employee turnover this place has. They continuously have someone I don't notice working there. My problem is I love these subs, but this specific location is absolutley horrible. The workers absolutely suck. 

Go learn how to be nice and read a peice of paper."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches and the staff is always friendly. If you want a solid chain-restaurant sandwich, stop in.  You have to get the Italian sub-yum!"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak anywhere in Charlotte. Love the fresh fries as well!"}
{"text":"I love the steak and cheese. The staff is very friendly and I dont spend forever waiting on my order. I also love the cleanliness."}
{"text":"My husband & I had a great experience at Penn Station subs on st Patrick's day. We stumbled upon this sandwich shop on our way to meet friends and decided to drop in for a quick bite to eat. We ordered a food long Italian with a medium order of fries and shared.  Both the sub & fries were made to order, hot and delicious. I love a hot Italian hoagie & fresh cut fries! It was plenty of food for the two of us. The location was clean, our food was made quick, and the staff was incredibly friendly. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, delicious subs, and very clean bathrooms! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm from the North and love a cheese steak so thought this would be perfect since it's right near my home.  Unfortunately, either the staff is underpaid, under-trained, or both, because the service has been AWFUL every time I've gone there.  They are consistently under-staffed and the ordering process makes no sense (and is rarely followed b/c of the under-staffing).

I managed 3 restaurants in my past life and understand the need to keep labor costs down but not at the expense of your livelihood / restaurant future.  

Unless they make some large scale changes I've made my last visit to Penn Station."}
{"text":"The food tastes great but it's terribly overpriced for portion size. I'm tired of this place constantly scrimping on the meats. The last time I ordered a large, there was meat on only 2/3 of the cheesesteak. They used to be so much better."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude. Stood at the counter for 5 minutes and was completely ignored. When we asked if we could order they said 'there's lots ahead of you' and walked away. When we turned to leave, the actually laughed at us. 

Great job penn station. You've permanently lost a customer."}
{"text":"The subs are OK, 4 or 5 stars no way...please.  I have been here a few times but don't go as much now that there is a Jersey Mikes is the area, as they have better hot sandwiches than this place.

The service here was always good and the food is OK just not worth the stars all these other reviewers are giving this place.

Overall I like the lemonade and the fries are decent.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Great quality subs and fries. Really like that the fries are freshly cut all day long. So tasty! Good quantity of food for the price. Although price is a bit expensive in my mind. Service is efficient but not overly friendly. I've tried various subs and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"If it is a great sub sandwich you seek then Penn Station is the place to get it... I have been visiting this location for the past 7 years and 9 times out of 10 the sandwich always reminds me while I keep coming back for their delicious cheesesteak. The only reason I cannot give them 5 stars is that they have made me a fresh cut fry addict and I think I may need therapy now to stop eating them.... 

Seriously though great food with speedy service and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza and Sausage subs!  Not health food..but simply fantastic!  I don't stop here often..but always enjoy it when I do!"}
{"text":"I love Penn Station, this is in my top five of sandwich shops.  I first started going to the one in Rock Hill, so I am glad they brought one to Charlotte!

I love the flavor of their subs! Their hot subs are really their speciality.  I love the philly, pizza, and sausage subs the best.  The chicken parm is also good.  Kevin loves their Italian.  

I also like their fresh cut fries, but a real treat is their chocolate chip cookie.  I should have never tried those things, they are awesome.  The vanilla flavor in the cookie, chocolate chunks, just yummy! If you can be good and wait until you get home to eat it, I suggest putting the cookie in the microwave for a few seconds, it is melt in your mouth good - just like it came out of the oven!

I wish they did something for their regular customers, like buy so many subs get one free.  They have the monthly sub deal, but I don't care about drinks or sometimes don't care about that months sub.  I've joined their email club, but coupons are rare.

Overall, love their subs!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at Penn Station in probably 6 years.  I forgot how good a hot sub tasted.  Gimme that Italian sub any day.  I am not sure it helped my fat loss goal for the day ah but what the hell...French fries are cut fresh and yessir I slathered them in malt vinegar.  Prompt service and very friendly employees."}
{"text":"Great food (& quick). Staff is very friendly!! Always greeted with a \"hello\". Great fries too"}
{"text":"The chicken philly is amazing! Very filling sandwich, and now addicted to the people who work there! So much fun!"}
{"text":"Good sub, great fries, and exceptional service.  Not in the area often but will be sure to visit when I return."}
{"text":"So-so. Not a big fan of their bread or meat. Service is always good though. We have been there 5 times and it is always consistent."}
{"text":"The staff is more interested in having fun than serving customers. They paid little attention to customers while engaging in personal conversations, playing movies, and taking smoke breaks. The food was pretty good actually. I'd rather have a meal somewhere that the service was great and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped by to get dinner on a Sunday night. The place was empty. We were promptly greeted and our orders received. I got a call Philly cheesesteak with extra meat and my wife got a grilled veggie sandwich. The food took like 10-15 minutes to come out. My sandwich was really amazing and the steak tasted so good. I put some hot sauce on it and that made it taste even better. I will certainly order again. Per my wife, her veggie sandwich was good too. Rudys used to be our go to place for sandwiches mostly because they have beer too but this place is very comparable."}
{"text":"I came to Penn Station on a lunch date on a Monday afternoon. The dining room was quiet but there was Pandora playing on the TV so that gave the place a little more life. 

Ordered the classic Philly Cheese Steak sub with small fries. The sub was bigger than expected and was a great value for the price we paid (we split the sub). The cashiers were very nice, and the whole staff seemed to be in a good mood. 

I don't usually go out to chain restaurants, but this definitely fills a craving that comes up every once and a while. I do plan on returning in the future."}
{"text":"These are the best subs. They always use fresh ingredients and the service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I had been warned by friends that the quality and service at this location had gone down. But I was sick and thought fresh cut fries and lemonade might make me feel better. I called in to place the order and was told they would not make them until I got there.I was ok with that, at least they would be fresh.  When I arrived 5 min later, I see the lemonade was not ready and  the woman who was supposed to be making it was more concerned with pulling her pants up and fixing her hair than cutting lemons.And she wasn't wear gloves so I was turned off after that.  I cancel the lemonade and just get fries. I live 5 min away. I sit down to eat my fries only to find they are ice cold, over cooked and hard as rocks! I will not be going back to this Penn Station again."}
{"text":"LOVE the subs! The level of service at the Steele Creek location is by far the best. Employees are always friendly and I never have to wait too long for my sub whether it's a slow or busy day."}
{"text":"I love this little shop with delicious sandwiches and French fries! The fries are delicious, and I don't think many people realize this. Everything has good flavor and tastes fresh! Usually not a line and because they make everything fresh, it does take a bit of time. But the food is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great subs! Comparable to Quizno's. The prices are good for the amount of food you get. Their fries are great! 

I always get the cheese steak with sausage added. The lemon aid is good too!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite spots to grab a sandwich. 

Great location and the customer service is always on point. Employees seem to be happy and eager to help you get started on the order. 

They have a great selection on sandwiches and the fresh fries are a must have here. Love seeing fresh peeled potatoes on the spot,  not something you see much of now a days. My favorite sandwich is the Rueben. The sauce is a must have on here, gives it a lot of flavor, I'm European and love sauerkraut, might not be something everybody loves, but it tastes great, perfect ratio of meat to the bread. Must try here. 

Reason for 4 stars is because they don't have ranch dressing, you have to have ranch dressing to go with the fries.  Other then that, stop reading and check them out."}
{"text":"This place is really REALLY good! Stayed at a nearby hotel and stopped in to get dinner to go for 4 of us.  6 inch sub was perfect size and the small fries was extremely generous with the amount of fries that are in the serving. 

The staff working the evening of Saturday June 23rd 2018 (around 6:30 pm) we all super friendly.  They are a perfect example of what customer service should be.

They have hot a cold subs (Rueben was AMAZING) and all of the subs can be made into salads. I am a sub girl at heart and Penn Station East Coast Subs are better than most of the other places that I will frequently go to."}
{"text":"Subs are very fresh and tasty. Fries are fresh cut and really top notch. The one additional positive about this place is the staff. They are mostly younger adults and teens, but the management is doing something right, as I have been in a number of times and the staff have been very friendly and courteous. My orders have always been accurate and fresh/hot. The one slightly negative aspect is that the pricing structure is a little high, but you are paying for quality product. I would definitely recommend a try!"}
{"text":"For a busy Saturday afternoon this is the worst service I have ever seen. They had about 2 people working and no one even came to the register to take our order. I had to keep staring someone down to even get their attention. Awkward. Once we ordered no one was even at the register so we could pay. I quickly realized then that no one who has been in front of us had gotten their food yet and there was no sense of urgency to get anything out quick. The only time I may ever be back here is on a Tuesday when it may be far less busy."}
{"text":"For my team and I this is our go-to place for lunch. I usually bounce between the chicken parm and the chicken teriyaki subs, because neither have lettuce or tomato or mayo on them. Their bread is fresh baked, and they have delicious square chocolate chip cookies. 

Their sizes start at 6\" which is usually more than I can eat. They also have the choice of turning your sub into a meal with fries and a drink. The fries are comparable to Five Guys, which means they are delicious! The prices can be a little pricey with the meal being $9.40(ish), and the 6\" starting at $4.99, but it's definitely worth it for quality."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight and didn't care much for it. Been here before but this will be it. The sandwich fell apart and was inconvenient to handle. Tonight they had the Pandora on the TV set to some rap station and the lyrics were highly inappropriate. I don't need to hear the N-word when waiting for my sandwich."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Penn Station. I agree with previous reviews...nothing fancy about this sub shop but they do have some darn good bread. 

Here's the rundown:

Steak and Cheese-So I'll be honest it comes with a bunch of stuff that I'm sure combined is delicious...But I'm not into all that and really just wanted to taste the flavors in the meat so I kept it simple and just had steak, cheese and banana peppers. It was a pretty solid sandwich. They grill it up right then and then run it thru an oven...which is a nice touch. There were good flavors to the meat but the real winner for me was the bread! It was really delicious. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside...perfect!

Fries:There hand cut and could be really delicious if served up hot. But be careful, if you are getting to-go the fries come in a cup and all of them will end up at the bottom of your bag causing a greasy mess....just guess who was lucky enough to find that out the hard way!

Lemonade-Biggest downer....it was watery and even adding sugar when I got home didn't help. There was nothing freshly squeezed or delicious about it. Let's hope it was a bad batch. 

I'm looking forward to trying more of their sandwiches. I'll keep you guys posted!"}
{"text":"Penn station has very good food and excellent service. Service is number one for me. You could have great food, but if you are a dick and your servers are snobs, I won't spend a dime there."}
{"text":"The service is fast, and the workers were very friendly. The bread is soft/chewy which is perfect for the hot subs that get thrown into the oven. 

The philly-cheese steak is their staple, but I usually prefer to order the chicken teriyaki. Add peppers & onions and BAM you've got yourself a great lunch/dinner. 

I love that they have fries here as opposed to the standard chips that most sub places have. The sizes are huge, so a medium is more than enough to split between two people.  Also: their lemonade is hand squeezed and AMAZING. It's addicted, so save some extra calorie points for a refill."}
{"text":"It's almost ludicrous that I've not reviewed Penn Station before, considering how many times a month my husband and I order from there.

Other places may win on creativity of ingredients but if the bread is poor, it's all over. The thing that makes Penn Station stand out from other sub shops in the area is the quality of the bread they use. Crispy, crunchy, chewy, flavorful, able to hold all ingredients within - it's always fresh, never stale.

I'm partial to the Philadelphia Cheesesteak as well as the Dagwood, but love every sandwich on the menu. I can honestly say I've never been disappointed with either the quality of the ingredients or the customer service."}
{"text":"Big fan, had the Philly cheesteak with mushroom onions and pizza sauce. Really enjoyed it. Only thing is their rolls are quite thin and wish I knew that before ordering because I would have ordered a bigger sandwich. Great service and quick too. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Penn Station offers a delicious selection of subs, with a bit of an unhealthy structure to the building of the sandwich. They let you do whatever you want, if they have it, they will sell it to you on the sub. 

The staff and service is always above par. A thing that I appreciate in a fast food environment. In fact, service is excellent here on the regular. 

As for the three star review, I base that mostly on the price point, which is a bit high for my perceived market value. Also, and I know the fries are made fresh, but somehow I always get more disappointing fries in my batch than delicious ones. Not sure how that happens."}
{"text":"Customer service lacks ALOT to be desired!  Something in the food irritated my lips!!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning after eating the Chicken Teriyaki sub. Last 48 hours have been hell. 

Thanks Penn Station!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while waiting for my car to be serviced across the street at Pep Boys. Excellent service, friendly and helpful. I ordered a 6\" Ruben, with fries which was not fatty, had good flavor, hot, and the fries perfectly crispy. Would definitely stop by again. I can't imagine eating a much larger sandwich, just this was really filling!"}
{"text":"Penn Station in Avon is finally OPEN!! *Happy Dancing*This place was packed with a line all the way to the door when we arrived about 12:45. We waited in line for 15 min to order then heard there was a 30 min wait to get food. That's fine. It's Penn Station and they just opened Wednesday. We only waited for 10 min to get our food which was perfect!  Hot, delicious, correct toppings, etc. I'm sure once thing calm down a bit all will be running on time. So glad to have a closer store than the one in North Olmsted. Will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"It's a sub shop. Don't come here if you're expecting some artisan bread and hand-cured meat products. 

Definitely one of the better chains in comparison. Also, these dudes serve fries with their sammies. Way better than a wimpy-ass bag of chips. Truth be told, the fries are pretty awesome.

Had the chicken salad with some peppers. It was a little heavy on the mayo, but flavors were balanced. 

Would I go back? Yes. Would I go back right now? No. Would I revisit the menu with a curious friend who just so happened to have a craving for a sammich and french fries? Of course."}
{"text":"If you want a tasty sub at a reasonable price, stay away from this place. Weakest, most overpriced sub I have ever ordered in my life. Almost no meat, almost no extras and way overpriced!!!! Don't say I didn't warn you!!!"}
{"text":"My sub was good but my fries were cold. None of the employees wear gloves when making your food, which I thought was super nasty. Some of the guys were nice but one employee was really rude and gave attitude."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was very clean , friendly, and had great food. I will be going back to that location very soon. thanks for the great sub!"}
{"text":"Fresh and fast Cooked to order. Just don't like the loud TV"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and fries! I like the size options of the subs, and the flavors are all delicious. Staff is awesome. Cons - only one I can think of... the subs and fries are moist and juicy, but the to-go bags are thin paper, so if they had some bags that don't soak through it would be even better. But regardless, it is always a no-brainer for lunch!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few times, never have a problem with my food. However, Customer service isn't the best. Cashier was not welcoming and looked like she hated her life."}
{"text":"So for a fast food place their food is amazing! They serve nice toasty subs. My go-to is the Italian sausage sub or the chicken teriyaki. They have menu options or you can create your own. They also have lighter options for people. And their fries are pretty good or just get a bag of chips as your side. The service is pretty fast. The staff is friendly. If you eat in just sit down and they will bring the food to you! They also serve fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and freshly made lemonade."}
{"text":"Sure, it's a chain, but they make good philly cheese steak sandwiches.

I'm not a fan of their french fries as they tend to be a little on the oily/limp side for my liking.  I prefer a crisp crunchy fry with bite to it.

Their lemonade is also very good here.  I think I stop in for the lemonade more often then eating the food though."}
{"text":"Food is always good here but the service was bad. When I was ordering the cashier was giving me a bad look. I ordered a sandwich with turkey lettuce tomato and mayo and the sandwich had no mayo. I noticed this after a few bites and they wouldn't give me another one because they said I ate to much to make me new one. It's getting three stars because the fries were good and it was quick."}
{"text":"SO much better than Subway and Quiznos put together.  Fresh meats, fresh bread, awesome flavors.  The place is very clean, staff is polite.  This is definitely our go-to place for subs."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the subs were good. Personally I feel that they are a little pricey considering its just a sub."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak is your typical cheesesteak. Cooked hot and fresh on the spot. The atmosphere is nothing special.  I wish they had one of these near Avon-area..The only one close is in North Olmsted for me."}
{"text":"Overpriced!

No complaints about the food. It took a little longer than it should have for such a simple menu... But that was not a big deal.  The food was actually good, although Chick-fil-a has better lemonade at a better price. 

I ordered a cheesesteak sub (regular size), large lemonade and fries. It came to $12. $6 to $8 would have been a reasonable price. $9 to $10, I would have felt it was a little expensive. $12... A lot too expensive for this kind of place. 

$12 is too much for sub, fries and a drink from a restaurant slightly more upscale than Subway or Jimmy Johns. 

Would I go Back... Eh, hard to say at this point. Probably not. I'd be more inclined to hit Viva Chicken, a could miles away if I'm going to drop $12 for lunch (actually $11 for a comparable sandwich, a side and DELICIOUS basil lemonade). 

Lower your prices guys... And I'll be in on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Well I left a review a few months ago but just had to leave another one. Just had the steak & cheese sub. It was outta this world delicious! I got it with meat, cheese, sautéed onions & pizza sauce. The quality of the sub was stellar and the taste was fresh! I'll definitely be back for another"}
{"text":"French fries are outstanding. Some of the best I have had. Everything else was mediocre at best. I had the Italian sub and the meat tastes like it came in a can."}
{"text":"I was working out of town and needed a quick lunch and decided to order a sandwich from here.

Bread was awesome and so was the turkey meat. I really enjoyed this sub, an awesome old fashioned sandwich shop. So good!

I really want to go there and try some more of the sandwiches. My coworker got the Reuben and that looked amazing."}
{"text":"I don't usually like these kind of fast food places, but if you are super hungry and you need a quick fix that tastes great, this has got to be the place.  It is one of those fast food places where all the workers have a very specific task and it works like an assebly line with great efficiency.  They yell out things to each other that are in some sort of Penn Station code.  I ordered an Italian hoagie, which is my old favorite.  It was greasey, but really delicious.  Italian hoagies tend to be on the greasey side of things.  The fries come in a cup, which is different and pretty unique.  I have eaten there a handful of times and I am never really disappointed."}
{"text":"Everytime I come into penn station, I get a delicious Reuben. I am always greeted by the enthusiastic workers and my food is done right. I've lived in New York for the better part of my life, and now I can enjoy a superior Reuben for a lower price. I mean $11 for a 12\" and a fry. Come on now. See you soon Penn Station!"}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak sub with marinara is the bomb, could have better more hospitable service though."}
{"text":"Wow I am impressed. We don't eat out very often but with the hustle and bustle we needed something quick and I must say in all seriousness I think that they have THE BEST Italian sub I've had in quite a while! Soft bread, perfect amount of dressing and meats. The 8in filled the guys up and the 8in made 2 meals for me. Between three of us we shared an order of fries. The fries are a really good treat to! Officially hooked. This will be our new place when we need to eat out / a cheat meal. Next time I'm going to try the Ruben sub!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was very disappointed.   Service was a bit surly.  There were no napkins.    Drink options were poor.  My sandwich was embarrassing.  I got a 10 inch Reuben, which is a $9 sandwich.   It had about 7 sad pieces of corned beef on it.   Maybe 2-3 ounces.    I should have just gone next door to Arby's.  I would have gotten more food for less money.   And it would have tasted better."}
{"text":"I haven't been to another Penn Station subs so I can't compare this to the rest but its a pretty decent hot sandwich chain in my books. 

I've only tried the cheesesteak the two times I've gone and its definitely not a true Philadelphia cheesesteak, but it wasn't a terrible version either.  

I love the fries!"}
{"text":"I had to give a shout out to this place. My friend and I stopped by here last week because he has been telling me about it for ages but I've never thought about it while I was out. He said I absolutely had to try the Philly Cheesesteak sub. Man, let me tell ya, best Philly I have ever had. The put plenty of steak and mine was loaded with cheese to the point that it was sticking to  my fingers. I got it with all the fixens on it. When we left I wanted to turn around when we were a mile away and go back and get one more to take home with me. The do the Philly justice!"}
{"text":"Wow. I am a long time fan and customer but will never go back to this location.  Ridiculously rude incompetent crew."}
{"text":"Just picked up a to go order, the Dagwood and the artichoke with mushrooms.  Really good!"}
{"text":"Always hustling, great fries! One of most underrated sub places around. Really fresh bread. I am a fan of the Italian and my roommate loves the chicken parm. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Quick service, Sub is very filling. 8\" sub was almost too much for 1 person for dinner. Not shy on toppings or meat. Fries are fresh and they put them in the fryer when you order them."}
{"text":"Thank you for helping me with my burn! This is the most welcomed place with very nice people. I burnt my hand with boiled water at my room, but need to get to school immediately. After simple treatment, I grabbed a Ziploc to go out and find place for ice which could be helpful with my pain. Then I came in Penn station, they were so nice and care to help me with this emergency. Thank you! Thank you so much!The ice I put on my hand on the road to school was very important and helpful. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Staff isn't paying attention. So slow. They forgot to include one of our orders and then when we asked for it they gave us the wrong order and it was gross and all grease."}
{"text":"Fresh and amazing subs famous for the Cheesesteak but the Italian and chicken Philly are also my favs. I get angry at myself for going to other places because they've been very dissapointing over and over. I just wish Penn Station had cheese sauce for their fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Eaten here 4 or 5 times and it has been good, better than the other locations I have eaten at. I think theyare getting a bad rep from a few reviews..."}
{"text":"I love Penn Station, but the service in this location is exceedingly slow.  Use common sense and try to come here during off-peak hours if you're looking to snag a sandwich and be out the door in less than 10 minutes.  Also, good luck trying to find parking.  

Otherwise, with regards to the food, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"We got two Tuna melts and neither one had hardly any tuna. Very skimpy on everything. Not worth the cost no value"}
{"text":"My favorite sub joint! The pizza sub with Italian sausage is the best! Their fries are ridiculous & they give u plenty. When u order the pizza sub ask for a side of sauce to dip ur sub in. U will not be disappointed. Forget the rest. This is the best! Oh yea, buy a cookie chunk and ask them to heat it for u! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"The \"Italian\" is a sub that I will be back to eat again, and again! Word to the wise it is a pretty salty sandwich but I like salt so I was very happy with what I got. 

The fries were talked up so highly before I got here I was a little disappointed but I will be back to see if I came on an off day. 

The atmosphere is very casual and the staff was quick to make some suggestions to someone like myself who was visiting for the first time. 

Wait time was pretty reasonable. $$$$$ Price is were Penn Station falls short. The price compared to the other sub companies around town is significantly more for the amount of food received. 

I hope to revisit and update this review with to reflect the same thing everyone else is saying about the fries."}
{"text":"Ok I read the reviews of Penn Station East Coast Subs and they weren't all that great. I was berated by some very close friends for wanting to try this place but every place deserves a fair shake. All told its not a bad sub. Plus the fries are fresh cut and pretty good as well. The staff was very friendly, tried to up sell me and delivered my meal with a smile. That's all you can ask for. :)"}
{"text":"I am just visit the family in the area. I needed good food and quick service. On a whim I pulled into this little strip mall of a shopping center because I was hungry for a good sub sandwich. Well, I certainly got what I was looking for and more. It looked a little unassuming from the outside, but after entering the inside was clean and everything seemed to be in it's place. Upon entering through the door you were greeted in a family manner by the counter person and asked, \"How can I help you?\". There are large printed menu boards mounted above the counter area, which is set up like a deli counter. After choosing my sub sandwich type, size- 6in., 8in., 12 in., etc (yes they went bigger), and if you wanted it toasted or not( I got mine toasted). Then move down the counter to order fresh cut fries and your drink. It was self serve for fountain drinks. You pay got the meal and get your cup and by the time you are done filling your drink your order is up. The whole process takes maybe 5 minutes. Now for the tale of the tape! How is the food? Right? Well, given the minor investment of a measly 5 minutes of your time, the food is really quite good. The sub sandwich has good balance of meat and cheese ratio, the condiments perfectly fit don't over power the sandwich, and the bread is a baguette type of sub roll which lends itself to toasting very well. Now we come to the Fresh Cut Fries. The fries are flash fries do in Peanut oil (those with allergies may want to note this). I like fries that are fried this way because they seem to have a lighter texture and taste to them. Then again I do not have any good allergies to contend with.the cost was fairly reasonable at about $9. Only thing that is disappointing is that I do not have a Penn Station - East Coast Style Subs near where I live, which is ironically near the east coast."}
{"text":"At this establishment I ordered the Philly cheesesteak with extra mayo and onions also with an order on fries. I swear their were more onions on the sandwich then meat and the fries were overly salted. For the amount of money I paid it was a waste. I'll have to give this place two thumbs down....."}
{"text":"Are the subs good?  Yes.  Is the steak grilled fresh?  Yes?  Do they use MSG to make the meat taste better than it actually is?  Yes.  For the last reason they get two stars."}
{"text":"You know.... I always stop by Penn Station when I get a hankering for super good fries.  Stopped today and was not disappointed. No idea how they do it.... but after eating one order of small fries.... there was just two drops of oil from the fryer on my little platter.  How can you ever find 8 oz of fries and NO oil in the mullet wrapper!"}
{"text":"It had been a horrible day.  Lean Cuisine was not going to cut it.  Let's go to Penn Station East Coast Subs!

Located off of Providence Rd, just past 485, this is in the same shopping center as Hickory Tavern and Harris Teeter (and Carvel!).  At 7:45 pm on a Wednesday (school night), there were more people there than I expected.  

Upon walking in, I gave my order to a friendly gentleman, then moved a few feet to pay.  Drinks are self serve and my meal was brought to my table a few minutes later.   There are a few tables outside (which people were smoking at - GROSS), and quite a few tables inside as well.

The food:
12\" cheesesteak ($9) - I can eat a 12\" Subway sub with no problem, but this bad boy, wow... towards the end, I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it.  But I tried hard and believed in myself and managed to eat everything but the crumbs.   Served smoking hot, the meat was plentiful and well seasoned on bread that was toasted enough to keep the ingredients together (for the most part), but still soft on the inside.  I didn't go with the fully loaded cheesesteak (I don't like mushrooms or mustard) and had cheese, onions and mayo.  Absolutely delicious, though a bit drippy.
Small fries ($1.69) - meh, they were fries.  I am not a huge fry fan and just ate a few, but they were hot and made from potatoes.  Ketchup is self-serve from a pump next to the drink machine and they also have malt vinegar if that is your preference.

It was just over $13 for a 12\" sub, small fry and a drink - a little more that your average sub place, but quite good.  Good food, friendly employees, clean interior, fresh tasting ingredients, Penn Station is a winner and I shall return."}
{"text":"Good hot subs, better than Quizno's. Fries at great! Service is slow, which is a product of the system, not the workers. Staff is always friendly and helpful. I rate it 4 stars due to their sloww system of ordering."}
{"text":"Zero accountability and lack of concern for quality or order accuracy. 

I've been going to this location for a few years and have never seen the same employee twice. The high turnover contributes to the abysmal service. Tonight one of the employees gleefully told me \"It's my last day, so *shrugs*\"

Let's dive into the most recent visit:

I enter the store, briefly glancing at the menu before looking at the lone employee. I shift closer and closer to the employee's sightline and he finally acknowledges my presence and asks: \"Do you know what you want?\"

I slowly give my order, pausing after each sandwich. He mumbles something about \"cash out at the end\", so I wait by the register.
Two other employees arrive in the meantime (one cleaning up the store, who comes from the back, and a woman who comes through the front door). The woman immediately takes the register, accepting my payment. She begins touching things in the prep area WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS, and flits into the back room. The young man that was cleaning,takes over the completion of my order, while the person who took my order left to smoke outside. I was short a fry, and when I brought it to the employee's attention, he stated: \"I wondered why he made so many fries.\" 

I get home, confident that my order will be correct after spending $40 and 15 minutes in store. I asked for no cheese on the sandwich. The ticket read \"No cheese\". So why was my sandwich so packed with cheese that I couldn't open it? I immediately call the store, requesting the general manager's number. They refuse, but give and email address. I email the GM, to give him a heads up that I am dissatisfied. I drive all the way back to the store, with the screwed up sub and the rest of the food that was cold. 

My husband asks to speak to the manager, and the guy that messed up the sandwich says \"I am the manager\". My husband asks for the sandwich to be corrected and to exchange the cold food for hot food. The 'manager' takes the sub THAT HE MESSED UP TO BEGIN WITH and refuses to replace the cold food. My husband asks for the number for corporate... they waste his time by giving the store number instead. Someone must have contacted the GM in the meantime, because he calls to also refuse that the order be remade hot and fresh. The GM gives the ok for the other sandwiches to be remade, so we wait for those. We left with hot sandwiches and cold fries, wasted time, and wasted money.

TL:DR  Don't waste your time at this Penn Station location. They will mess up your food, give you the runaround, and leave you with a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the better sandwich place in North Olmsted.I almost always get the Philly cheesesteak with mushroom, onion, provolone cheese and mayo. On occasion I've switched it up and had the chicken salad sandwich, also fantastic. The fries are a little under cooked for my liking, but not horrible. Lemonade is fresh squeezed and one  of he better lemoades I've had. Prices are a little steep, but definatly worth every penny. You may find yourself waiting longer for your food then you would at McDonald's, but again well worth the wait and few extra bucks!"}
{"text":"Love the food, but wow. Second time here this week that the cashier is the ONLY smiling, friendly person behind the counter. Quaylin has a great attitude, even when the sassy woman snapped at him on Sunday. Wish everyone had his great attitude!"}
{"text":"So I ordered the cheesesteak special and my wife ordered the chicken salad. We had to try this location because it is right down the road from work. Food was great. Service was better than I expected for a brand new Resturant. The food was prepared timely and correct. I went with the fresh-squeezed lemonade based on recommendation of cashier. It was good call."}
{"text":"I have been to this Penn Station a number of times. Most penn stations I have been to seem to be inconsistent with the amount of meat they put on their cheese steaks. I found this one by Great Northern to be a lot better than most! until; recently. the 2 cheese steaks My wife and I ate their last night had very little meat on them ! they go very heavy on the sauted onions to cover for the lack of meat! What a shame  20 dollars for 2 onion sandwich with veggies. We also ordered a large fries lightly done! no salt and they were over cooked! what a shame! unless we get a buy one get one we wont be back! I am not a vegetarian, I like my meat!"}
{"text":"The Strongsville location has over the top customer service. Will and his team are excellent!!!They know my order and start making it as I walk in the door. One of the cleanest fast food franchise locations have ever been in. I think the review below about using bear hands is a review of another location. I have been coming to the Strongsville location for many years and that is simply no the case or I would not eat hear."}
{"text":"Always fast and their classic philly steak is so juicy. Favorite sandwich shop in Charlotte. The staff is always friendly and working hard. We frequent this location.  The fries are made fresh, hot, wedged."}
{"text":"Right down the middle is all I can say about Penn Station ECS. We did a carry out order with 3 subs. Mine was a Club Sub with a side of fries. This was a fine sandwich, no complaints, however it didn't stand out either. Just a solid, if average, meal."}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly at this location and they never seem to disappoint. I love building my own sub: grilled turkey, provolone, grilled onions, banana peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, olives and honey mustard. The honey mustard is bomb and the workers recommended that I order a side of it to dip my fries in. Oh and did I mention the fries? They are hand cut when you order them (look behind the counter and you will see them cut the potatoes). They are awesome and a must!

I've also had the veggie sub, which is good for all your leaf eaters out there :-) it Included grilled veggies, which is a nice mix up from other sub places."}
{"text":"No Service even if you do have Shoes and a Shirt On

This place opened last Friday so as of today it is open a grand total of 4 days.  Not much training time it's less of a training issue and more of a culture that the customer is secondary.

This is not a review of the food because I ended up leaving before I ever got served. Granted I paid for the two subs I ordered but with payment comes a verbal contract to deliver and that never happened.  It's not a review of the physical facilty because how bad can it get in 4 doors.

My wife is out with firends viewing Christmas lights so I thought I would give Penn Subs a try. After all, I've watched this place being built from the time they tore down the self serve car wash, to the read clay and finally a brick and mortor struture and I had heard from others that the sandwiches were pretty good. 

Decided to get one for my dinner and one for her for a midnight snack.  For her I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and I had a Cold Italian.  Had to repeat the order three times because the person taking my order was not paying attention to me but to all of his friends around him. Ended up ordering a Hot Italian because it was easier to just go ahead and get that than to explain for the 4th time, I did not want it hot.

Went to the other end of the counter and pay and had to decline an order of ketchup three times. Should have been obvious because this order was to go, did not have fries and nothing else you would put ketchup on.

After waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting, I left.  Granted I had already paid but I did not pay for the agrivation I was going through.  

Bottom line, till they grow up and find out that this is a business and not a social club to see all of your friends, your time and money is spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Don't know if it's a chain or not, but the subs are fantastic!  And listen, if you know how finicky children can be, my brood of three rambunctious boys love to go here and will even ask for it by name!  That alone would be enough for a great review!  And comparing this joint to Jersey Mikes is the WORST comparison you could make.  Don't get me wrong JM is good, but NOWHERE near this place!  JM is the red headed step child compared to this place."}
{"text":"Very good sub shop in a really busy section of the city. I love their chicken parm subs that are made with grilled chicken with the option of mushrooms and onions. I recommend this place if you're in the area looking for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious filling subs  nice place to sit and enjoy lunch or dinner quick with your order subs come out nice and hot"}
{"text":"I've heard some good things about this sub place. And I finally gave it a try and yes, I like it! 
In comparison to Subway chains, Penn Station offers more options for size ( 6\", 8\", 10\" and 12\"/foot-long) but less options for filling and flavoring. Their Philly Cheese Steak, the significant sandwich here, tastes just right to me,"}
{"text":"We really love the subs here, you will pay a little more, but the taste is fantastic, Fries are exellent. Service is really good and place is really clean."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this place after reading reviews and hearing good things about it from friends...........(yes, there's a but, a big old butt).

BUT...

When I ordered something went wrong, way wrong.  Either they need to up their medical coverage benefits or hire new, competent staff.  I ordered a Club sub cold (hearing check).  The slip showed what ordered (eye check).  What I got was a toasted sub...ugh, all I wanted was a cold sub.

I didn't want a toasted bread, melted cheese or hot meat.  I wanted it nice and cold.  I hate having wilty type of lettuce, tomatoes don't taste the same to me, and when you add the sauce beforehand and heat it up, it doesn't taste the same.

I may give this place a second chance, but only after the bad taste is out of my mouth."}
{"text":"We went in here 10 minutes before close and the 3 guys working here were the nicest guys ever. They were so gracious to us and made incredible subs for us. Will be back"}
{"text":"I just started traveling into Cleveland for work, and this place is .5 mile from my hotel.  Great fries, but even better subs!"}
{"text":"I went here a few days after they opened. I ordered the 6 in. Grilled Artichoke Sub and a side of fries and an iced tea.  The sub was good, but I felt the price was a bit high for the portion size. The Grilled Artichoke sub has canned artichoke hearts, melted cheese and mayo on it. The fries were great and the iced tea tasted fresh. I was satisfied with my meal, but it did cost around $11. The service was good and the restaurant was clean though, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Compared to several other sandwich places such as Subway or Jimmy John's, I found East Coast Subs Penn Station to give off a vibe of higher quality. I ordered the month's specialty: the pizza sub ( of course I forgot the exact name.) The presentation was beautiful and the sandwich could compete with some pizza places. Yes I know it would a different type of pizza with all that meat but still. One nitpick I had having little to do with taste was the relative lack of options. Still I feel as though another trip in which I order a \"regular\" sandwich would allow for a more complete review. 

The service was quick and efficient yet professional and the restaurant was relatively well maintained. Unfortunately I forgotten my own golden rule: a reliable method of judging how well maintained a food joint is lies in how clean the bathroom is. But hey, how can I penalize the restaurant for my mistake."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great sandwiches, yummy fries and lemonade that's freshly squeezed. I moved to Charlotte from Ohio and was excited to see Penn Station was here too!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to Penn Station East Coast Subs while I was in Charlotte, and I have to say I thought their subs were amazing! I had the Chicken terriyaki Sub with mushrooms, and a side of their homemade fries. I had never been to any chain restaurant that made their own fries, and to order, before! It was really impressive.

I wished I could give them 5 stars, but unfortunately when I went to the register to pay for my sub, the girl who took my order failed to input it into the machine. Thankfully the manager helped get my order to the right people to make my sub, but it was still a bit irksome.

If you are in Charlotte and looking for some good fries and a sub, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that after recently being converted to Dibella's, Penn Station really didn't stand much of a chance. I had heard so many rave reviews from friends about this place that I figured that I would finally lay it all to rest by trying it for myself. And unfortunately the result was not extremely favorable.

I would most closely compare Penn Station to Quiznos.... but not as good and much more expensive. I found the food somewhat  bland and underwhelming and when my final cost was calculated I felt gyped... or maybe raped is a better word. For a lower price I could have had a much better tasting sub at either Quiznos or Dibella's (and here it would have been twice the size).

Although the staff wasn't rude, it was very apparent that they weren't enjoying their jobs. The girl who helped us slouched and mumbled and didn't make eye contact. Although, I have considered that perhaps I'm asking too much in a society where customer service is no longer expected.

I would recommend that if you are in this area and are in dire need of a sub in your belly, head over to Quiznos which is directly across the street."}
{"text":"Disgusting! If it were possible to give this location a negative star rating, I would! Avoid at all costs! 

I went in to pick up an order and no one greeted me for over five minutes while I waited at the register, when I finally was greeted, the cashier had the nerve to get an attitude and act as though I was disturbing her. To top it all off, not only did they completely screw up my order, THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY FOOD!"}
{"text":"Don't understand why there are such bad reviews. I tried it for the first time yesterday and had the philly cheese steak with Swiss cheese. It was delicious! I will definitely go there again to try some of the other selections"}
{"text":"Chicken parm sub with banana peppers was great. I love that everything is cooked on the grill right in front of you. The staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Great subs, excellent service at this location. Love the chocolate chunk cookies as well. Robert is the man!"}
{"text":"I love Penn Station!From the bread to the toppings to the chocolate chip cookie,it just can't get any better.I've been a fan for some years and make a stop when I am on this side of CLT.I wish they would open up one closer to the northside.The employees are really nice and friendly at this location."}
{"text":"Our office got subs to go. Friday at lunchtime was pretty busy. 

The bags were dripping with grease when we opened them up back at the office. 

Chicken Parm was pretty good, but didn't realize it would be grilled. Veggie sub was just ok, hardly any veggies on it. Fries were natural cut but a little too soggy for my taste.

Prices ended up being about $10 per person for lunch which is slightly high, it standard for the area. 

Not overly impressed. 

Might try it again sometime."}
{"text":"A blast from the past.   I have eaten at Penn Station since the 90's.    They offer a variety of sandwiches but I always gravitate to the Philly Cheese Steak.

The fries are fresh cut and cooked fresh for you.   They take a Five Guys approach and fill your bag with fries and place your sub on top to keep them warm.

This location seems hidden but was a great find.

Great food at a decent price."}
{"text":"I haven't actually been into the restaurant, so can't comment on some of the challenges others have had with the service. I always send my boyfriend over to pick up my subs. It's a no-mess, nothing fancy kind of place that's a great place to pick up a quick sandwich when your fridge is empty. 

That said, I have never been disappointed by a sandwich. The bread is amazing, and the ingredients are fresh and prepared well. The steak and cheese is really great - not too greasy. We added sautéed banana peppers for a little crispness, which was amazing. The small sub is the perfect size, too. Not so big you get about 10 meals out of it, but enough to make you full. 

Not the most amazing subs I've ever had (I'm from the East Coast), but definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Really good food at really good prices,  there was so much meat in my sandwich it was falling out the sides!  I eat here quite often as I work downtown and have always had a good experience"}
{"text":"Garbage. The meat is like old hamburger meat they try to Mask with sauces and Banana peppers. A sad imitation of a Philly Cheese steak. Go anywhere else with you hard earned nine bucks."}
{"text":"They were very nice at this location.  They were out of plain ice tea at 9pm, but offered to make more so my mom could have her tea.  The food was delicious and just what I expect from penn station :)"}
{"text":"It's Penn Station so you know what to expect food wise but the service is so-so and they are very disorganized. I see only two other tables occupied but my wife's sandwich came out and then I had to wait about 5 minutes for mine. Meh"}
{"text":"I ordered the italian special with fries and drink.  The sandwich was so full of oil the bread was soggy and split open.  It did have plenty of meat, but I wasn't wowed by the bread or the overall flavors.  It did have some nice red tomoato slices and lettuce though."}
{"text":"Yes , new Management with great crews !! Ate at different times some dinners n lunches . Talked to new Manager very positive ! Love my Artichoke!"}
{"text":"Penn Station is not my favorite sub place, but my husband likes it. The food is decent and subs are tasty. I like that the fries are fresh and they have malt vinegar which takes me back to my travels in England. What I don't like is that prices aren't set for combos except the sub of the month. So fries and drinks are ordered a la carte. 

Customer service at this location is not always the best. It seems like no one ever smiles and that you are bothering them when you are ordering or checking out.  I also had one incident where my husband and I were on the same ticket. They asked for his name but not mine. So my ticket said \"woman\" when the sub came out. They could have taken a second to ask for my name. 

The subs are good and made fresh, but customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Penn Station before, but I must say my artichoke sandwich with chicken was pretty tasty. Fresh cut fries are always a pleasure to see on a menu and the fries would be especially great if Penn Station served cheese sauce to dip them in mmm...

The price was reasonable and the wait was not too long, my only real complaint would be on the staff. One young lady was exceptional; very friendly, helpful, and patient, but the others not so much. As soon as I walked in the door I was jumped on like a lion eager for a bite out of a gazelle. Thanks for the welcoming hello, but no need to ask for my name and keep asking me what I want to order when I am not even at the counter and I'm faced away from you; give me a minute to look at the menu and I'll come to you when I'm ready. The other issue would have to be on sanitation, the young man who put my fries down also rang up customers on the cash register and never took off his gloves. When I asked him if he would throw away the gloves and get new ones before handling food again, he laughed at me and said \"It's okay, we sanitize\". Um what? He then pointed at a little foam dispenser. 

The kid wasn't violating any food safety rules, but it is recommended by the Ohio Health Department \"to change your gloves and wash your hands between 
touching money and preparing food.\" Also there is this, \"Plastic or Latex gloves are considered SINGLE-USE and task specific. They must be discarded and hands properly washed when interruptions occur in the operation such as dispensing drinks or handling money.\"

It's a shame the tasty food is in the background of this review, but when you laugh in the face of a customer concerned about your sanitation practices while preparing their meal, you're lucky to even get two stars."}
{"text":"Decent subs for a national chain. Quality is pretty good and staff is relatively friendly. Place is average all around so that is why it gets 3 stars.  There bread is one of the better breads you will find for a hoagie too."}
{"text":"This is the last sub place in the area that we've yet to try. We went to Penn Station for a quick Memorial Day lunch. As you walk in, you notice the easy to read menu, wooden benches, and the meats (or lack thereof) in the cooler. I got the Chicken Cordon Bleu, my dad got an Italian, and we split a medium french fry (we had a Citipass for a free sub w/ purchase of another sub, 2 drinks, and a medium fry). The fries and my dad's sandwich came out first. 

The fries were delicious, better than Five Guys, which are pretty good! My dad liked his sandwich as well. Mine finally came out, and the first thing I noticed was the sheer amount of cheese on the bread. Ugh. I had a bite, and it basically was cheese and ham. I quickly figured out I ordered the wrong thing, I did not like it one bit. I sort of swallowed half and was done with it. I would definitely come back and try something like the chicken parmesan next time.

The service was very good. The gentleman who took our order was lively and respectful, and seemed like someone you could sit down and have a chat with. I would definitely come back to Penn Station and update my review after I try something more up my alley."}
{"text":"For the price, I expected to be blown away by their sandwiches. This place gets PACKED for lunch during the week, so don't go if you're short on time. 

I ordered a 6-inch, toasted  \"Dagwood\" create your own sandwich with turkey, cheese and veggies. The bread was ok, but I was not blown away by the overall sandwich. 

The fries looked delicious, but I couldn't handle that heavy of a meal for lunch or I would be asleep at my desk in no time. 

Next time, I'll probably save some money and go to Subway, where I'll get a footlong subpar sandwich, drink and chips for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of penn station and frequent every couple of months to get my greasy sandwich fix. Today as I was ordering, a roach climbed along the wall near the counter. I quickly cancelled my order."}
{"text":"Went there at 8:20 pm and was closed when they were supposed to be open till 9:00 pm. Very unhappy."}
{"text":"I won't spend too much time writing a review of a fast food sub shop, but I am a fan of Penn Station. There are four chain sub shops around town that I would recommend, and Penn Station is one of them. Oddly, the one with \"Sub...\" in its name is not. 

A good sandwich starts with the bread, and Penn Station's buttery hearth-baked baguette, toasted to perfection, provides the quintessential foundation for a fantastic sandwich. My go-to's are the chicken cordon bleu, chicken teriyaki, and the grilled artichoke (with chicken), but I have tried them all (save for the tuna salad because I think that's just gross) and they're all really good. 

The tomatoes are always perfectly ripe; not the weird green ones you find at other places, and the lettuce, onions, peppers and other produce are also of equal quality, which makes a huge difference to me. Anyone who has been to the other places and have witnessed the brown lettuce and greenish tomatoes knows exactly what I'm talking about. Not a worry at Penn Station. 

Their \"fresh cut\" fries are also on point, fried in cholesterol-free peanut oil which provides for a slightly different flavor profile, but they're served unsalted. I suppose I get it, but c'mon, you're still eating French fries, don't tell me about you heart and blood pressure problems now! Throw some salt on there guys! 

Finally, if you're looking for a little sweetness, surprisingly enough, Penn Station's chocolate chunk cookie squares are to die for. Slightly under baked in the middle giving you just a hint of the raw cookie dough, with melted chocolate chunks; you're going to want another. 

Writing this review actually reminded me of how much I really do like Penn Station. Great sandwiches, great fries, and great cookies! What else could you possibly ask for?"}
{"text":"My go-to place for their chicken salad and fries. Seriously some of the best fresh-cut fries around (with malt vinegar)! If you get the large order, they aren't kidding when they say it will feed four..adults! And the staff there is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I live near the one in Shadyside & ordered a decent cheesesteak one time (although I added extra meat after reading reviews) 

Bobby & I headed to the downtown location maybe a week after it had opened. We had plans for dinner that day so decided on a cordon bleu to split & get our stomachs by a few hours.

We sit down & eat. After 3 awkward bites of bread, mayo & lettuce (ick), I open my half sub to find 4 measley pieces of chicken.. & not chicken strips.. just chopped chicken. oh yeah there were a few more (maybe 5 total) of pieces of ham the size of my brittle nonexistent fingernails.

So if you enjoy lettuce subs then you'll love it here for lunch."}
{"text":"Everything here screams fresh. The lemonade, Fries, and made to order subs. i came around 8pm the area was clean order was made fast."}
{"text":"While the sub itself tasted fine, it was not the sub I had ordered. I watched other customers who ordered far later than I had get their subs five minutes before I had gotten mine - a sandwich I did not order. But as i had gotten take out, I couldn't even switch to the right one. I got an artichoke sub instead of the chicken teriyaki i had ordered. I just hope the poor sod who got my sub wasn't a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I love a good Penn Station sandwich; I've never had a bad one!  I've had a variety of their subs and they've always been great.  I highly recommend their sausage, chicken teriyaki or Philly cheesesteak, all are fantastic.  They have fresh-cut fries which are always great, too --not to mention they have malt vinegar which makes them even better.

This location in particular is nice.  I've never seen the place busy, and it's extremely clean.  Like most of their restaurants, they setup in a cafe style so you order the food then its brought out to you.  This is a great place for a quick sandwich --a sandwich that is a few notches above the typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"When this place is not busy they are super quick. Subs are pretty decent. Just got the chicken philly. A little light on the meat gotta get double chicken. Fries are amazing. Kitchen workers look like they're waiting for closing time."}
{"text":"I only ate at a Penn Station and it was at this particular location.  I am a very very very picky eater.  So when I get my order made special it is like a totally different item.  However I really enjoyed my meal.  I thought the cheese steak with only tomatoes was very tasty. I only requested tomatoes on my sandwich.  Because of calories I rarely eat fries.  These fries were very good.  In all, for a semi fast food place, it was very nice."}
{"text":"Staff is not the most pleasant but the sub tastes good, especially the veggie grilled one! Highly recommend the sub. Staff hiring could be made better to have it a move inviting place. But no complains on subs!"}
{"text":"So I just drive like 30 minutes to this location to find that it has been closed. I would recommend updating your internet accounts to reflect this as to not waste any other potential customers time and money."}
{"text":"I love coming here to eat with my husband.  We always split a Philly cheese steak and large order of fries."}
{"text":"Came to this Penn Station and they gave me burned fries.  I'm very disappointed because I always get good food at these spots and now this.  Sorry, but you only get 2 Stars"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and totally disagree. I was there for the first time and wow had great service, great food and the employees were smiling the entire time.  I enjoyed my time there and will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"This place is poorly run, took me 15 minutes to get to order with only 2 people in front of me and when I went to the register there the cashier had run away. Not even busy and poor customer service is disappointing."}
{"text":"Free sub if you download the app! Great service and the Cheese steak is awesome!"}
{"text":"Penn Station is one of the vest sub sandwich joins around period! Subway who more like Wrongway? Firehouse, over priced. Penn Station is Fresh made to order flat grill crafted sub's designed for an explosion concert to your taste buds. Hands down the greatest chocolate chip cookie in the Worldddd!"}
{"text":"Consistently great grilled subs made fresh.  Don't miss the fresh cut fries cooked in peanut oil. Service here is always fast and friendly.  Best sub in the area.  Great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"When we mentioned it was our first time, they gave us the fries for free. Great friendly service for out-of-towners."}
{"text":"The club sandwich is my favorite and it's really good. The employees are friendly and the service is usually fast."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this location. The staff are always friendly and make great subs! I was curious about the cookies and the manager let me try one for free. I usually get the chicken teriyaki sub and it's always perfect! Riveting with plenty of umami flavor. Get some fries to go, they are plenty to share in case you have a girlfriend like mine who never asks for fries but is the first one to bring them out of the bag..."}
{"text":"Not sure why some of these reviews have low stars and yet very good comments? I am a regular customer here at this location, and I give all 5 stars because they deserve it. The staff is all 5 stars and the food ( philly cheese steak ) if excellent for the price. I love the fries and chocolate cookie at the end of the checkout line. Come on guys, we HAVE to help our small local places out. ( our government sure won't help them )
Keep on doing a Great job Penn Station!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot.  I don't eat here every day because I don't want to weigh 300 pounds, but, I could.  Great people, best fries in town, and Cheese Steaks are as good as anything in Philadelphia - and I should know - i lived on the cheese steak diet for 5 years of college in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Fast ,convenient and very satisfying . They feature a variety of sub choices and toppings. I took home a menu to look over and I am curious to try out the grilled artichoke sub the next time I stop in.  Tonight I ordered the steak hoagie and originally skipped the fries but gave in and ended up adding a small fry much to my delight.
The staff is very courteous and helpful and they were able to keep the orders moving for their customers dining in and those calling in for pick up."}
{"text":"I love this place. Wow the steak sub and fries are so tasty and filling. A bit pricey I think but so darn good. I come to this place as often as I can. Love the Lemonade and the team here gives first-rate service."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here it had just opened and the food was hot and service was great!  Went back a couple more times and food was still good but service is a hit and miss."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the slowest sandwich place I have ever been. They had two people working during lunch, one of whom generally seemed to be trying while the other was clearly disinterested in her job. Will never return. Could have eaten at a full service restaurant in the amount of time it took to get a sandwich here."}
{"text":"This is my second time thought I would give this Penn Station another try I have tried others but this Penn Station is run by a bunch of young people who looks scared who don't know how to do anything as far as customer service the weighing of the meats is a little ridiculous there's a lot better ways to do it then to show people that there so chintzy when it comes to giving portions of proteins it's not like the sandwiches are cheap it's very expensive the breads bad they really don't know how to cook customer service is bad if it wasn't for the best french fries on the planet nobody would ever go here"}
{"text":"New location, on point. Had to wait a few for the sub, maybe they'll get a little faster as they are still new. 

Cheesesteak is awesome. Try it out! 

Sign up for their emails too, you'll get offers sometimes!"}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteak around! I know it's a chain but I have been going to Penn Station for years and am never disappointed. If you want a fast, fresh philly cheeseteak, this is the place to go without a doubt. Plus it's cheap!"}
{"text":"Penn station used to be the lunch spot or for a quick pick up. The staff used to be amazing and always welcoming. The last time I went to get penn station was last night as I was trying to call in for a to go at 7:15 the phone line was dead it didn't sound like it was busy. I knew that they closed at 8 so I decided to just go there and wait since the phone wasn't working. When I told them their phone wasn't working the \"manger\" went and reconnected it right in front of me. After everything I heard them say about customers I will not be back there even though I love the food. So rude and that is not how you treat customers with so many other take out options around us."}
{"text":"Probably if not one of thee best sub sandwiches around. Good here if you like subs and did I mention potato patch fries freshly cut!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, Philly cheesesteak is amazing!  Don't hesitate - just go here and get some good eats.  You won't regret it!  I'm from out of state, my only problem with this place is that there isn't one closer to my home in Idaho!  You guys rock."}
{"text":"Maybe they've made some changes? My boyfriend and I went here for a quick dinner and not only were our subs great but so was the customer service! I had the Philly cheesesteak, my boyfriend had the tuna salad and we shared a medium fry. The fries and the lemonade made me feel like I was at a state fair! Fresh cut fries and fresh squeezed lemonade! Both of us will be returning customers!"}
{"text":"I waffled on the 4 or 5 stars. I said to myself, \"Self- only Skyline and Shake Shack chains consistently deserve the 5 star rating.\" Then I remembered how much I like the Italian subs at Penn Station. They always bring my taste buds much happiness. It's my favorite hot Italian Sub. There, I said it."}
{"text":"I think Penn Station is great.... a little pricey but you do get great quality subs here.  I like their Philly Cheese steaks.   I would only give them -1 star because their subs always come with a lot of grease which i'm not a fan of.  I also like their Italian sub and their chicken subs isn't to bad either.  Their lemonade is very good and freshly squeezed.   Their fries are pretty good as well and you do get a lot when ordering med and greater sizes.  I would come back here a lot more often but It's just not healthy.  Finding coupons helps a little with the pricing but to be honest they beat out Charley's subs and way better then Subway and Quizno's and Mr Hero, They beat out Jimmy John's as well but JJ's just do cold subs so can't really compare them.

This location sometimes puts way to many banana peppers on the philly's..."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say, the remodel inside has cured the problem with the gnats around the soda counter. Food is always great! Service is unmatched. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I love the Italian it's the best. When you want to cheat on your diet this place  is worth it. Fresh bread and prepared just perfect!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times now, this time wasn't as good as the others.  I only ordered three subs and only one was a special type order, no tomatoes or mayonnaise on one 8\" Italian and the rest where normal, 12\" Italian and a 8\" chicken salad.  I had to tell him a couple times the order and we went down to pay at the other end and by that time they had already messed up the sandwiches.   They had to redo them to get it right,  it wasn't rocket science or anything confusing.   By the time I got the sandwiches home I was only able to eat maybe 3/4's of mine because the bread was too soggy to hold up anymore and fell apart.   One good thing was the French fries were decent which I added the malt vinegar to as well.  I guess it's hit or miss here, I had a couple good sandwiches there in the past,  it also depends on who is working,  never saw this crew before but the guy actually making the sandwiches looked like he was working hard while the others were in and out of the back room.  I will still try it again in the future."}
{"text":"OMG MY SUB WAS REALLY GOOD!! I had the vegetarian sub and added artichoke!!! The staff was friendly. They bring your sub out to your table. The cookies were AMAZING!!!! Place looked clean and also they had 60in TV on the wall with ESPN playing. Nice place for lunch"}
{"text":"This place has a great sandwich, great fries, great lemonade, great service, and great prices.  This is exactly the type of place I wish we had more of in SF.  If you are in the area you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sandwich shop!!
I get the grilled vegetarian loaded up with provolone and teriyaki sauce.
Pair it with the fresh fries and an iced tea and I'm a happy gal!
The service is always fast and friendly.
The lady manager is a delight!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Penn Station subs since I tried them in KY and my experience at the Park Road location has remained true to form.  My favorite is the chicken teriyaki (all the way) and it's always fantastic.  And their fries are so fresh and delicious.  I've never witnessed any unclean actions on the part of the employees, so all-in-all, I'm a satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Penn Station location a couple times and have always had a good experience. The food is generally made fast and tastes good. The place itself is a little small so i don't think i would want to eat in during the biggest part of the lunch hour and just get it to go then. Overall I like the place and whenever i'm out in North Olmstead i'll probably end up eating there if i'm hungry at the time."}
{"text":"There subs are much better than subways or any other sub place. There food is consistently amazing and fresh. The last time I went here I got the chicken Parmesan sub, and my girl friend bought the Philly cheesesteak. Both were amazing. We also had to buy there fresh cut fries. They have so many subs to choose from, it's always so tough for us to choose what kind to buy. No matter what we choose, it always tastes great!"}
{"text":"As with most fast food places, the person you interact with can make or break your experience. 

Location - the Yelp! Map is slightly off. It is next to Five Guys in the strip canter. 

Food - five stars. They offer sub sandwiches with a good variety of hot choices. We spilt a 12\" Philly cheesesteak. Delicious! The fries are thicker and are pretty average. I prefer shoestring, so my average rating on fries is skewed. 

Service - the person taking our order was less than intelligent and downright rude. He asked for a name for the order. I gave him my husband's name. So, he turns to my husband and asks what WE want...even though I started the order. We had to repeat the order five times because we asked him to leave off the mayo. Seriously, not the most intelligent person I've met. The guy at the end of the line was fantastic. He was polite and apologetic (he overheard our order process).

If in the area, I'd return. If I lived here, I'd go twice a month for lunch. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is not the best Penn Station I have ever been too.  They skimped a ton on the ingredients they put in their sandwiches.  The staff was pleasant but the sandwiches were less than stellar at this location."}
{"text":"My husband works close by and decided to be awesome and bring me some lunch. 

We both had the 8 inch steak and cheese sub with mushrooms and onions. The sub was very flavorful seasoned right and satisfying. The fries are made fresh and you can taste the difference, the only disappointing part was when they ended :) 

I gave it four stars because it is a little pricey but that won't stop me from coming back to try the other options."}
{"text":"Came in with a large group for a late lunch. Brittany was awesome and very patient!  Everyone's order was correct (and delicious). The fries are outstanding (as are the cookies)."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday evening & it was practically empty. We ordered, paid, and the food was out within minutes...fresh and hot. Everyone ordered the Italian. The hot Italian tasted better than the cold Italian. When ordering you have the option of fries or chips. Beware if you have a peanut allergy because the fries are cooked in peanut oil. I think Penn Station is decent place for a quick bite. You won't have the most amazing sandwich ever but it definitely beats out subway."}
{"text":"Ordered cheese steak sub.  Came out quick because it was 2pm, but when I got home 10 minutes later I found it was super greasy, the meat had hard pieces of nerves and the bun was soggy.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, decent food. Would return."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Penn Stations I've been too! For those of you who've never been to Penn, it's a sub shop kind of like Subway but with more options for the inside of the sub and less options for the bread. You can choose a 6\", 8\", 10\" or 12\". They serve great French fries too so make sure to order some, and the fresh lemonade is a must! 

About this Penn Station: it is very spacious and was kept very clean. There were 3 guys working behind the counter but they were all very nice and helpful! When we got our subs, they were in the middle of making a fresh batch of lemonade and since they make all the fries fresh those weren't ready either. So one of the guys brought out our drinks a few minutes later to where we were sitting down. By mid-sub, we realized we still hadn't gotten our fries.. I went up to the guy who took my order and he immediately apologized. They had the fries ready in another few minutes and even gave us free cookies! (Which are also insanely good)

All in all, the customer service was great, the food was great and the place was great!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place because it always smells wonderful while driving by. I love the smell of vinegar fries. My co workers highly recommended it so I gave it a shot. My husband loved it me however not so much. The prices were way to high! My sub wasn't good at all. In fact I gave it to my dogs. They seemed to like it. The fries were good but pretty soggy. The best thing for the whole meal was the cookie. I'd go back for the cookie. The rest not so much. Sorry Penn Station."}
{"text":"I would NEVER eat here again! They dont wear gloves when they prepare the food and I totally understand that you dont have too since the grill is right there but not everyone works on the grill and the same woman taking money I witness her cut my sub. Sandwhich was not worth $11. Jersey Mike's is much better!"}
{"text":"I can't eat here anymore because it's not good for me but I just wanted to stop and say I miss you. I miss your beautiful philly sub, perfection fries, and beyond yums chocolate chunk cookie. 
I miss you. Hit me up sometime."}
{"text":"Got their grilled veggie 6\" sandwich. The taste was great. Compared to subway this sub had a lot more flavor and was hot, grilled and delicious.

Another place to go for a nice veggie sandwich. It is hard to find veggie options in most places  and even if you do, they are not delicious. This is an exception.

A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches! I've eaten almost all the things here. I keep coming back time after time. I went philly steak this time. Fries were amazing and we kept the vinegar and ketchup flowing. Lemonade and ice tea on tap and the service and food is fast casual. Hugely awesome spot for lunch. Continue the great work."}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews, but had to write this one.   This is by far my favorite sub location.  The food, service and value is amazing.   The entire staff is so nice and professional.   Love this place!   My favorite is the cooked Turkey Dagwood!"}
{"text":"Providing this disaster of a restaurant with 1 Star is generous. How in the world with a \"build your own\" sandwich can you completely botch the order? I ordered possibly the easiest order for them to date. Bread, Turkey, Veggies, cheese, mayo/mustard, very specifically ordered \"No Pork\". 
 My order was \"To-Go\" or \"Carry-Out\" and I was in a hurry so didn't think about checking for accuracy. I go to car, drive away 30 mins or so to my destination and go to eat my food. I got pepperoni, ham?, wasn't turkey for sure, and grease. Bread was so soggy I couldn't even unwrap it. Pathetic. Thanks for the waste of time, money, and energy writing such a poor review. #DoNotEatHere"}
{"text":"I love Penn Station!  I have been a fan of this place for several years, and I am so glad this place has been right now the road from my job.  They have delicious hot subs and some of the best fries when you get them hot.

My favorite subs here are the Italian, the Grilled Artichoke (a great vegetarian option), and their Club.  If you prefer to choose your own toppings, their Dagwood allows you to do just that.  You can get their subs cold or toasted, and they come in four different sizes.  As for sides, you can get a bag of chips to go with their subs, but you would be sorely missing out on their great fries.  When they are fresh, they are simply bomb-diggity!  And if you're craving something sweet, their chocolate chip cookies really hit the spot.

This location is pretty convenient and reasonably quick.  You can call in your order and come pick it up or wait in there.  I will warn you that the wait area by the register is very small and gets cramped with one or two people there.  Sometimes the fries are not completely fresh, although most of the time they are pretty good about it here.  Additionally, sometimes this location takes a long time to get orders around.  Still, they do a decent job here.

Overall, I give this location 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Subs are boring.  Subs are a vessel to cram food in your facehole and still have one hand free to drive, slap someone or even throw up gang signs.  I had a coupon for buy-1-get-one so I used it no problem.  They open at 10:30 which is nice.  The desk warriors in the corporate world usually don't start lunch till 11 so ya have the place free of desk jockeys for the first half hour.  They were \"open\" but door was locked, floors were wet and no cash in the register yet.  Place has fingerprints all over it.  Needs a wipedown somethin' awful.  Next door is a laudromat which is great people watching too.  Crack a 40, eat the sandwich in the whip and watch the show..."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast and friendly service. The place was clean and the environment was nice. Definetly will be going back for more delicious subs."}
{"text":"Nice place for a decent sub.  I always opt for the grilled veggie sub, which I enjoy.  Their fries are really good too.  Good place to try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Jim and the strongsville penn station are great.  They are friendly quick and the food is great.  I still think they make the best sandwiches out there.  The lemonade is fantastic."}
{"text":"Penn Station isn't bad but not exactly a place I would try again. The subs were decent, probably better than subway but nowhere near as good as quizno's. Quizno's simply uses better ingredients, has subs that seemed to be crafted by a chef, so all of the flavors compliment each other while Penn Stations subs seem  more haphazardly thrown together and then toasted. 

Their fries are fresh, blanched first and then finished the second time in oil and as another reviewer put are greasy but good. Overall their food is adequate, with a slightly higher prices like Quizno's but without the high quality and taste of a Quizno's."}
{"text":"Food was quick, delicious, and the people were very nice. Loved it and will def come back!"}
{"text":"Great subs and great service.  Picked up a tray of Italian subs for my son's party this weekend.  They give you all the extras such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc. in separate containers so you can make the sub as you want. The kids loved them.  Can't go wrong with Penn Station."}
{"text":"Overall: Very good subs, excellent fries but high prices.  They need to cool it on the up-selling.

Food: 3 stars.  The subs are good but very skinny.  The fresh-cut fries are excellent.  They should have a Hawaiian (ham & pineapple) like Great Steak does.

Prices: 2 stars.  The subs are definitely on the expensive side.  I believe an 8\" is $7.49 and a 10\" is $8.79.  A medium fry is about $3.50.

Service: 3 stars.  They seem to be annoyed when you don't know what you want.  Also, they try to up-sell you though the whole line, including adding fries, fresh squeezed lemonade and cookies.  It feels like they care less about your experience and more about selling you more stuff.

Atmosphere: 3 stars.  It's set up like a Jimmy Johns.  They have a big-screen TV with sports."}
{"text":"I was running errands in the area and realized I hadn't had a single bite of food all day and I was craving a sandwich. I looked on Yelp and Penn Station Sub Shop had good reviews and was nearby so I thought I would give it a try! I order a 6inch tuna salad sandwich, small order of French fries and a drink. It was delicious! The fries were fresh and cooked to order, the tuna salad was terrific and the veggies were crisp and fresh! Definitely will come back again! The customer service was excellent and staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"The steak and cheese was ok....I was really wanting a really good steak and cheese sandwich. I will go back and try a different sandwich in the future. The lemonade was excellent!"}
{"text":"At first glance I was like, \" wow that's a skinny sub\" but there was plenty of meat and toppings. I could only eat half. The fries are really good as well."}
{"text":"After informing the manager about being sexually harassed and feeling like my gender was being dehumanized I was fired. 
Is it coincidence that they fired me the same week they find out I'm non binary?"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing to me. I've walked by it several times, thinking 'I need to try this place'. I got a 10\" cheesesteak. It looked no where near how good it looked in the picture.

The length looked short, although I didn't have a tool to measure. There was a skimpy amount of meat. No lettuce or tomato. Mayo & mustard? I must not have heard that properly. For the price I paid I felt like I got the short end of the stick. Before I was done eating I was regretful that I didn't go to DiBellas instead.

My experience was so disappointing that I don't think a second chance would make a difference."}
{"text":"This place is like any other sub place except it doesn't let you make changes to your sub order. I asked for pepperoni on half of my sub. The woman that worked there was hesitant and stated that they usually didn't do that. I would prefer she told me that it was against their policy but instead she said she would do it \"just this time\" and the  put pepperoni on the whole thing anyway. She seemed a little rude and honestly the sub wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Great service, they greet you like they know you and say goodbye! I felt cherished.. Their fries are to die for. Fresh cut potatoes, malt vinegar for seasoning. There's always a plain dealer newspaper and CN or sports on the big screen TV.  Everyone who works there seems to say hello and ask if everything is all right. My favorite, the phillly cheesesteak is a perfect sandwich when double meat and extra onions are requested."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Penn Station ever since the first time I tried them. I don't think I had a bad experience with the food. There has been one time where I had a bad customer experience but otherwise, all the workers are friendly. They bring you the food and sometimes will take your tray for you. They have 12 different subs to choose from and their fries are really good as well. I would recommend Penn Station over Subway, Jimmy Johns and Jersey Mikes."}
{"text":"Great fast food. People were very helpful and friendly. Food was hot and well prepared. Great value"}
{"text":"Amazing subs! Sweet & friendly staff!  Very clean. Highly recommend the chicken Philly cheesesteak, fries, and the chicken cordon bleu! Lots of veggie options like the grilled artichoke.. Love it"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try them for a while. I was craving a cheesesteak and expecting a cheesesteak at least at the level of the mall food court, but this was much much better. The steak, mushrooms, banana peppers and bread were all noticeably fresh. The fresh cut fries were solid. Their fresh squeezed lemonade rivals chickfila's. note: this is not a subway type of sub shop. you wont find too many light or healthy options, but you can create your own sandwich. the employees were super nice and the meal wasn't expensive at all. if you're looking for a nice, great tasting sub and not afraid of calories, then definitely check them out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!! I loved their club and the fries. They were delicious. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Haven't had one of their subs since I moved out of Bloomfield.  I think the Rt 8 location does a nice job and their a solid, filling sandwich.  Definitely a go to for the food deprived Mars area."}
{"text":"A coworker and I ended up checking out Penn Station Subs when we were looking for something besides our usual lunch spots. When I learned they had a pizza sub I was beyond thrilled because I can't think of any other place around work that offers that. It was something different so it was perfect.

The sub itself was good but not great. Certain bites didn't taste like they had much sauce if any at all. I tend to like my things a little more on the saucy side so that was a bit of a disappointment for me. My only other complaint is regarding the size and price of the subs. The prices seem like a bit much for a sub that doesn't have a whole lot going on. Other than that the taste was great and I would definitely go back at some point. However it won't end up being a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"The fries are great but I thought the sandwiches left a lot to be desired.  The Reuben sandwich was dry.  The Philly wasn't really improved by the tomato sauce."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail for a free 6\" sub yesterday, and I was in the area, so I stopped in for a quick snack.  I was only here once before, and I honestly wasn't too crazy about the place.  It was when they first opened, and I ordered a steak sub and fries, and I didn't think the sub was all that good.  Well, when you have a free coupon, what do you have to lose . . . ?
I ordered a 6\" Artichoke sub (with optional mushrooms).  I also asked for light cheese (which I think they forgot about, because it was pretty cheesy to me).  It was a tasty sub for sure, I enjoyed it.  I certainly wouldn't call it my favorite or anything, but it was satisfactory, and it hit the spot as a light little snack, (and the price was right).  I have one more coupon for a free french fry, so I will be back again sometime soon, and as I remember from last time, I think the fries here were pretty decent.  The only thing is, there are so many other better places around here to eat, that this place would not be among my top choice for food in the area (like Brick N Mortar), but overall, I give it the A-OK rating.

P.S.  I thought it was nice that they offered free mints on your way out the door, but unfortunately, the ingredients were not listed on the wrapper (Sometimes mints use artificial sweeteners of which I am allergic to), so I declined."}
{"text":"I got a 6 inch Italian and I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very helpful and friendly, while the sandwich was grilled perfectly and the cheese and meat good quality and tasted excellent. I will say that this particular sandwich was just a little bit salty and a bit messy.

All in all, very good location if you need a quick cheap tasty lunch."}
{"text":"I can't help but love this place. The club and the rueben are crave worthy. The fries are fresh cut and the lemonade fresh squeezed. The staff at this chain location are always friendly and the store has recently had a facelift and appears to be very clean."}
{"text":"I have been going to Penn Station for years, and although it is NOT healthy at all, it sure is tasty.  I went got lunch there while out Christmas shopping.  I ordered the grilled veggie with teriyaki and small fries.  There is just something about Penn Station that I love.  They do sandwiches really, really well.  Add some malt vinegar to your fries, and they will be some of the best fries you've ever had.  Love me some Penn Station!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best philly cheesesteak in town! The chicken or plain artichoke is very good too. The downside is the wait time which is iffy no matter the time of day."}
{"text":"First time at this food spot and it was good! I got the Philly cheesesteak with everything and wow that was a lot of meat, cheese, and toppings. I got the fries too, they were also good. All for a decent price. Okay food coma just hit"}
{"text":"Love this place :)

Penn Station is my favorite chain sandwich stop.  The workers are always friendly, the food is always made fresh as you order, and is always consistent.  I have switched up multiple things on the menu such as getting 1/2 artichoke and 1/2 Philly and they never have problems creating sandwiches.  The fries are fresh cut and they are always overflowing out of the container."}
{"text":"I started a job in North Olmsted a few months ago and this has rapidly jumped into my top two places for lunch.  I have yet to have a sandwich here that has been anything but outstanding.  They have good fries (and put out malt vinegar for them....perfect) and the lemonade is excellent.  This location also seems to have a great staff and they're fast, friendly and attentive.  Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"I've been to Penn Station many times.  I've been to the Rock Hill, Providence Road, and even the old closed location on Park Road Ext.  I mostly frequent the Providence Rd. location now.  

I always get the cheesesteak sub so I can't comment on the other subs that they serve.  The steak comes standard with cheese, onions, mushrooms, banana peppers, and pizza sauce.  I get mine with just cheese, onions, mushrooms, mayo, and mustard.  What makes these subs so good are the fresh ingredients.  The steak is sliced fresh and the bread is baked there.  Also I'm pretty sure they butter the bread and toast it which adds that little bit of extra flavor and a few inches to the waiste line.  The fries are cut fresh and cooked up just right.

The subs can get a little on the pricey side but I guess you get what you pay for.  I think the 10\"-12\" sub is in the $8.50 range which does not include fries/chips or a drink.  Tack those on and you are easily in the $13+ range.  

If you are looking for a tasty cheesesteak give them a try, just head to the gym afterwards!"}
{"text":"I've only ate here twice but each time I come it just gets better and better. The service is excellent I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooooooo good! 

Great sandwiches, awesome staff, great prices, and gotta love those fresh french fries and lemonade!

Shoot... it was just what the doctor ordered after a day of fishing in the rain at the Westport Marina."}
{"text":"As I continued by reuben adventure around Charlotte to figure out how they all stacked up I stopped in at Penn Station - I was pleasantly surprised with the result. Although far from the healthiest reuben so far, it was definitely in a top third of the many I've tried across the Queen City. I wasn't expecting much from a chain-sub type place, but the corned beef was freshly chipped and piping hot. It was loaded with a thick layer of melted cheese and plenty of russian dressing. Overall I was quite impressed!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Server got the order wrong and blamed us for it. Can't speak for the food, but if it's good, I will go to another branch before going here again."}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be our last. I love a good sub! Gentleman at the cash register was friendly and answered my questions. Food was served to us in a few minutes. I got an italian sub and my husband got a create your own. We shared a small order of fries and they were crispy and hot. The small order is plenty for two people. The subs were delicious and the toppings were fresh. We will definitely come back. The staff is very friendly. As we were leaving they told us bye and thanked us!"}
{"text":"Always good. You cannot go wrong with the Philly Cheese steak. For quick food it's a solid choice. The place is always very clean. And everyone there is usually nice."}
{"text":"Wow, 20$ for two sandwiches and LG fries that were the size of hotdogs and fries overcooked not to mention slow service with 1 customer in front of us. Used to be a go to place but product and service lately keep us from weekend stop. This was last chance don't waste your money. Arby's across the street is better,also they had cool cleveland sports-centric decor but it's gone too,like us."}
{"text":"I heard them talking about this place on the radio and decided to pay a visit.  It's located in the former open,closed, open again, closed again Quiznos on Park road near Selwyn ave.  I had a Philly and tried the fries and lemonade.  The sandwich was pretty good but expensive.  Seriously, I get that good food should cost something but I was taken back by the price.  The fries were ok.  Could be great if they had vinegar.  

Overall, it's a nice alternative to all the other sandwich places around the area."}
{"text":"The subs at this place are great (I got a grilled italian with extra pickles). The fries were just so so but the star of the show for me was the homemade chocolate chip chip cookies...don't go here without getting one! My coworker and I were in the area for business and stopped by for a quick lunch. The place is very clean and the staff was really great, giving us recommendations as we had never been there before. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to Penn Station many times but today was my first time to this location. It was opening day. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and directed where to place our order. Easy choice for me, cheesesteak! Can't go wrong with that. I added sautéed onions and mushrooms, mayo, lettuce and tomato. The flavor of the meat is good. It not dry or like a steakum that some fast food places offer. It's real meat. The bread is fresh baked and soft, not the chewy crusty type. I also had french fries and a drink. They have the best french fries. Made from fresh potatoes. Only complaint was my order had a lot of little fry baby bits. I shower my fries in vinegar. They have iced tea which was good, Pepsi products and fresh lemonade. Once you order, you sit down and they bring the food to you. They came by once and asked how everything was. My 6\" cheesesteak, small fry and drink came to $10.44. Quick and tasty little spot! Glad to have them in Gibsonia. I will be back often!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but it took me FOREVER to get my sub. It wasn't very busy too. Hopefully, it was just bad luck and a one-time thing"}
{"text":"0 stars!  We haven't been to Penn Station recently, but we had an extremely bad and outrageous experience here a few years ago that has prompted us to never return!  I truly hope that management has changed since then.  Basically, my wife found a hair in her chicken sandwich, and management didn't want to make her another one (she wanted a refund at this point).  Anyway, we must have been standing there about half an hour as the snide and wiseass employee from hell kept calling (was she really?) her regional manager (or whomever) to confirm that it was OK to issue my wife a cash refund!  She was clearly playing games with us.  I remember I blew my stack in frustration, and stormed out of there in shock and disgust at their lack of basic customer service!  I don't even remember whether my wife got her refund or not.  One of the absolute WORST dining experiences ever.  At least under that management a few years ago."}
{"text":"So good. Club is my go to! Lemonade is great and the service is awesome. Really quick to bring out the food. A little overpriced, but that's all Penn Stations. By far the best sub shop around."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 10 years, love the Italian sub.  Staff is always friendly. Place is always clean."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes in line at the register to order watching 5 people showing their backs while prepping food. They had no interest in me. Easy decision to go right next door and do business elsewhere. Second time I tried to eat here. First time around they couldn't take my order because their credit card machine didn't work. It's a chain. Not sure what the fuss is about but I'll never know because this place is run by a monkey."}
{"text":"I can't seem to get a normal cold sub in this city. Grilled subs are fine, but sometimes I just want a good old fashioned Italian hoagie. I ordered a cold Italian sub at Penn Station and I got cold toppings on a toasted bun. Ugh. I'll have to remember to be more specific next time. Overall, just OK."}
{"text":"Very disorganized. Food okay. Heavy on the grease. Gave me the wrong order then my friend had to get a refund after his food didn't come after 30 minutes!! And that was a pain too! No people skills by this group. Too slow for lunch time."}
{"text":"1st time EVER eating at a Penn Station since moving here 3 years or so ago and I really liked their subs but absolutely adored those perfectly fried freedom fries!!  If you don't know already, the fries are not frozen, they are cut and fried on the spot.  Oh yeah, a large fry is really all 3-4 people need, I just got overly excited and ordered the bucket.  I have to say though, between the two of us (wife also LOVED THEM), we put quite the dent.

As for sandwich, I obviously went with the 10' Philly with meat, cheese, mushrooms, onions, and banana peppers.  This must be the big seller because the person taking my order rattled off exactly what I wanted.  You can also add mayo or mustard, but thought the calorie count already exceeded my daily amount.  The wife, lets call her Alison, had the 8\" Club.  As did I, Alison really liked the quality of the meat but also the bread.  Not too crisp where the roof of your mouth feels like someone took a metal rake to it.  I sampled a taste and agreed with the quality of all the ingredients.  Double meat / Double cheese isn't needed in my opinion but I can see how people would go for it especially after a night of drinking.

Last but not least is the freshly squeezed lemonade.  YUM!!  What a difference compared to the fountain crap.  Definitely a must get.  The large is also big enough to share between 2. 

Kid friendly, clean, bathrooms on site, and nice employees.  Food is relatively quick.  I will be back very soon.

HINT: Sign up on their website to receive emails and they will send you a buy one get one coupon.  WOOT!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new and clean Penn Station, despite what one of the other review may lead you to believe. No problems for me like the other reviewer had (she said she was pregnant so maybe the hormones were ragin' that day, I don't know). Good hot subs. The chocolate chunk cookie is to die for but it's 400 calories so I should expect it to be good."}
{"text":"Look, I ain't ashamed to admit it....I looooove me some Penn Station. I know it's a chain and I can hear people saying 'yeah, but it's not AUTHENTIC....' Blah blah blah. I usually don't frequent chains, nor fast food. But I've got it bad for Penn Station Philly Cheesesteak. Meaty, melty goodness. 

Also, it's super clean in this restaurant and the staff are actually very friendly and (gasp!) greet you warmly and make eye contact! Not your typical chain-store service. They always have a PD for you to read also - a nice touch. 

Yum! Get you some!"}
{"text":"I can't even. This place is one of our go-tos when we want a good stuff-your-face with delicious quick meal. We've tried a couple of different menu items over the years but nothing compares to the original Philly Cheesesteak here. So warm, melty, toasty and delicious. The bread is the secret here I'm convinced - just the right amount of chewy and crusty. 

The service is always friendly and the restaurant always clean. Plain Dealer up front for you to read about the latest while you wait or while you eat. 

If you've never been to a Penn Station, next time you think about fast-ish food, try it out. No doubt you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"What is up with this location? They honestly have a bunch of moronic teenage boys running this place. Not to mention their friends that sat at the table by the register talking to them the whole time. Somebody can't make french fries here because they were horribly over cooked. Also it must be too much to ask to put vegetables on a sandwich because even though I requested them and they were on my receipt they didn't appear on my sandwich. Whoever was supervising that day cut the guy off that was taking my order so he could use that computer to take someone else's order. Really effing rude. The only person that deserves any kind of praise was the guy that took my order. He was very nice, a younger guy with curly brown hair. I will never be returning to this location again. I will spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always packed for lunch.  Probably because Pittsburgher's love greasy hoagies.  If that's what you're into, then you'll probably love this place too.  Not my cup of tea.  I ordered one of the \"ligther\" options and it was still full of grease and it left me with a nasty stomach ache."}
{"text":"I am incredibly disappointed with this Penn Station! My family and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches before our long drive home to Indianapolis. The sandwiches were okay, but the service was terrible.  I am certain the man taking our order was stoned! I wish I knew his name to point him out, but all I know is that he is a very tall white man with dark hair. 
I specifically ordered 2 of our sandwiches without meat. Yet much to my dismay they put meat on all of our sandwiches! Two hours into our drive home, I was disappointed with the myself and the service of this Penn Station. I knew the man who took our order wasn't paying attention, and I should have checked the sandwiches before we left. Anyways, the service was sub par! I would recommend saving time and going elsewhere for your sandwich needs."}
{"text":"Penn station has delicious subs, including the Italian and the Pizza.  My biggest issue with this location is that the employees don't do well with any kind of special requests.  For example, I ordered an Italian sub with no mayo over the phone, which was confirmed by the receipt, only to receive an Italian sub slathered in mayo.  It's like the guy prepping it saw \"- mayonnaise\" on the order and assumed that meant \"emphasize the mayo.\" I have several coworkers who have had similar experiences with sauces and condiments here."}
{"text":"Yummy fast subs for a good price. Dont go to subway when you have this place. Fries are recommended for a side. Probably a dollar more than subway"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the sandwiches here. Only downfall at times is the wait on getting your food due to everything being cooked to order. Call ahead and skip the wait if you don't have much patience."}
{"text":"The big issue here is consistency. Inconsistent service, inconsistent food, and an inconsistent process. There are signs directing you where to go to order and where to go to pay, but over half the time, you get yelled at for waiting (for a long time) at the \"order here\" area instead of ordering at the \"pay here\" area. Even with the inconsistency of the sandwiches, they usually are better than Subway and both places are close walks for me, but with enough bad experiences, I am leaning towards just doing something else on a permanent basis when it comes to grabbing a quick bite close to home."}
{"text":"Came here after receiving a coupon for a free sub when registering with their new app. After holding on to the coupon, because their wasn't a location close to my house, I decided to hike it over to Remount Rd for a late lunch. 

When I arrived, no one was present. I immediately noticed the fabulous, spotless interior. The gentleman taking and preparing the orders was very polite and thorough. I ordered the chicken philly with mayo, onions and mushrooms and a small order of their freshly-cut fries. After paying a bit over $2 for everything, thanks to that awesome coupon, I chose a seat outside. 

After 5 or 6 minutes, my order was ready. Everything was piping hot. The fries were perfectly crisp outside and super flavorful with just the right amount of salt. The sandwich was heavenly. The perfect ratio of meat to veggies to mayo to bread to cheese. The bread was soft inside and crunchy outside, the onions and mushrooms were perfectly cooked, the mayo was present in just the right quantity and the cheese was oozing from the sandwich. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. It was the perfect sandwich, indeed. 

As I sat outside and dined (on a truly hot day), I was able to watch the LightRail zip past a few times which made for a delightful experience. 

All in all, I will be back next time a Philly cheesesteak craving hits. Penn Station gets it right, which is surprisingly refreshing for a chain."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and low-key. Have a lot of veggie varieties as well as \"The Dagwood\" and make you own ingrediant subs. They bread is far superior to the bland sub rolls of other sub places-you know who they are.

This is a chain with only a few locations in NC. I highly recommend the artichoke/mushroom sub. Served hot with lots of cheese and sauce!"}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

I fell on the scene a few days ago after himming and hamming for 30 mins as to where I would like to eat. Reading a few reviews and going on their webpage i found if you get their mobile app you can receive a free 6 inch sub. 

Did someone say FREE?
Yes, yes please I think I have enough to buy that.

I think this is the first time I actually went in without knowing what I wanted already. So standing their looking at the menu like a New York tourist. The young lady asked if i needed some help deciding what i wanted to order. I descided on the Pizza Sub. Think a pepperoni pizza. Now put that in between bread. POW, BANG, BING, BONG!!!! There you have it. I added sausage to the sub and it was pretty good. I would get it again. Next time i think I'll try another sub just to get another sub under my belt. 

They don't have a lot of different subs which i like. Be good at a lot of sandwiches. I'm all in. 

TTFN"}
{"text":"Penn Station is a great place to get a sandwich.  It's fast food that could easily be served at a restaurant. It's fresh & Hot made to order.  The fries are great also.  It kills any of those other grilled sandwich places.  The taste is light years ahead of a SubWay Philly sandwich.  
Restaurant is clean and people are nice, defiantly go there.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always impressed with their service. Even when a mistake is made (I asked for no pickles and got pickles) they will remake the sandwich and make sure that you are valued as a guest.

Really great sandwiches and even better personalities. On my first visit, I told them my name when I started my order and when I left there was a resounding \"Goodbye Kayla!\" No I wasn't a regular but the simple effort of remembering my name made the trip one well worth it."}
{"text":"After two years of hearing people rave about this place, I finally decided to give it a try.  Admittedly, I'm not a sandwich person and try to avoid breads as much as possible, but I still went into it with an open mind.   Unfortunately, it was still a huge disappointment all the way around. 

I ordered the Italian sub toasted with no mayo.  What I got was the most pathetic looking \"sandwich\" I have ever seen.  It definitely did NOT look like the picture on the menu!  The meats were sparse, shriveled and overcooked (crunchy) and my sandwich lacked the tomatoes that were promised on the menu.  It was almost comic  just how miserably inadequate the itsy-bitsy pieces of meat looked on the bread.  I actually ended up taking all of the meat and cheese from one side of the bread and putting it all on one half just to make it look like a real sandwich.  The taste was nothing extraordinary and the crunchy pieces of salami and whatever \"meat\" they put on were definitely not worth it. Ironically, the bread was tasty.

My Partner In Cuisines chicken parm. sub was tasty, but still desperately lacking in a good topping vs. bread ratio.

People who like fresh cut fries may enjoy the fries at Penn Station, but I wasn't a fan as I prefer the smaller, crunchier shoestring fries.  With those, however, at least I knew what I was getting into. 

For the money you pay to get a hoagie at Penn Station, you could get a really good sub (or at least a half decent one) at a local pizza place.  I will be doing that from now on and certainly not returning to Penn Station."}
{"text":"Good place for a well cooked/toasted sub. They're priced slightly higher than Subway, but that's because the product is better."}
{"text":"I had really big dreams for lunch today.... then I went here.

Too unkind? Well I realize my dream was really big and thats why I am going with 3 over the 2 star rating only because I had a 2 star floating in my head all day.  My job has me driving all over the county 4 days a week so I thought Oakland, great lunch spots, I'll try some place new. 

Back to my dream... I was dreaming of a big cheesey ooey gooey onion pepper slathered Philly cheesteak sub with lots of bread maybe a little au jus dripping down the side. Fattening sure  but I would have covered half and saved it for later.

I walk in and see the photo menus, using photos is a bad sales idea because the food almost never measures up.However everyone is doing it I get it. One deceiving difference here was the bread. It was sub style large white bread in the photos, ok pretty much what I am used to for \"east coast subs\" being a ny girl. 

My dream begins to defer... as I glance at the menu I see no green pepper offered in the photos oh well I can deal with it, then when I order sadly so sauce offered other than mayo (yeck) and mustard so I stick with mustard cry for lost peppers and decide to go with a combo. For a four inch sub and a combo its 8$ after tax. Ok thats fine because remember my dream with the Big thick meaty sub?

I sit and wait for my food friendly service, ok price, my belly grumbles. Then I glance down at what the cashier brings me and shed a philly tear for what I see on my plate. It's some sort of deflated philly subway shriveled looking thing. Not much meat or cheese, few veggies and EEK a baguette? The meat was pretty flavorless, cheese just eh, and again can I cry of the lack of veggies?

Don't get me wrong Je t'aime the baguette, crispy on the outside soft inside..... with some slabs of brie, cucumber tomato and a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic. Just Not on my philly sandwich. Ya dig? 

This is where my dream deferred, I'm saving it for Philly or the next time I am back home in ny.

The fries were nice fresh but not crispy, but the sandwich was very small not enough to hold me through the day. So if you have any metabolism at all I would order a larger sandwich and skip the combo, better value food for buck. Note to self next time im in this spot I am going to Chipotle, they never let me down for flavor and value.

So this place is a chain sandwich shop don't bring your big lunch dreams here save it for someplace else. I do like a few chains but not this one."}
{"text":"Very delicious sandwiches! The chicken teryaki is one of my favorites! Don't leave without getting some of their fries, definitely the best I have had in a while! Philly cheese steak it is the most ordered sub on the menu. Prices are a bit high, but it is still very tasty!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  I had a cheesesteak, the wife had teriyaki chicken, and the kids shared a build-your-own ham and cheese sub and we all had some fries.  They were paitient with obvious n00bz while we perused the menu. 

I thought the cheesesteak was excellent, & the fries were as expected.  As an adult with a severe shellfiah allergy,  I was happy to find a shellfish-free place & a fish free place in general on a Friday during lent.  Everyonevs sandwiches are gone, so they must have been good!

I hope to try the reuben some time soon.

They do cook in peanut oil, so nit allergy sufferers be warned.

Oh yeah... GET a cookie!"}
{"text":"There's really not much to dislike here. Plenty of combinations and fresh cut fries. A sub, fries, and a drink can get pricey but it's very high quality. So you will get your money's worth.

Now if only they offered a wheat bread. Only white is offered. It's VERY good and soft white bread, which should be noted."}
{"text":"I've passed this place several times and have been meaning to go in and check it out.. Didn't get the chance to, until an out of town friend came to visit and we were looking for a local place to grab a quick lunch. The service was great - very friendly staff, and the food was excellent as well - I got the 10\" chicken cordon bleu sandwich, my friend got the 10\" reuben, and we got a medium fry to split. After half a sandwich, we were both full, and wrapped our sandwiches to go. Later in the day we pulled them out of the fridge and stuck them in the oven to warm up for another meal - they were so good, possibly even better than the first halves. I would definitely recommend this place for a delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Good food if you can get someone else to pick it up...
We stopped in for a sandwich tonight around 7:30 or so. It's just a sub shop, but very good food, fries. Friendly service by the young guy that greeted us. But I probably won't go back simply because my bf and I smell like smoke, onions and grease. We both changed when we got home and I had a bath too, but it's in our hair. I don't know what the answer to this problem would be but I'd really have been upset if i was at lunch and had to go back to work smelling like that. 

I'd like to add, it took two days to get rid of that smell - washing all clothing and even our pillow cases because it was in our hair. I would never go again."}
{"text":"There are so many better sandwich options in this city, don't waste your time at this Penn Station.  First, our food took a very long time to arrive, and there weren't many patrons in the place. Then, when our food came, it was all wrong and seemed to be thrown together in a rush. Also, there was only about 2 slices of meat on both our sandwiches and the person I was in ordered a larger sub. I would think the meat would be proportional to the sandwich, but apparently not. 

Honestly, it was a situation where I wanted to say something once our food came out, and I should have, but we didn't think it would have taken as long as it did for the food and didn't have time to wait for a re-make. Save your time, and money and go to a different spot."}
{"text":"Nice new location.  Have never eaten a PS sub so when this location opened near my work decided to give it a try.  Staff was friendly, especially a nice women that seemed to enjoy her work.  I thought the price was very reasonable. You can order a 6, 8, 10 or 12 inch sub.  The fresh cut fries are cooked in peanut oil.  Drinks include fresh made lemonade, fresh brewed tea and Pepsi products.  
My Italian sub was very good.  Had the meat grilled and then it is put thru a little oven to melt the cheese. The Italian had ham, hard salami, pepperoni, provolone and was topped with lettuce tomatoes, red onion and banana peppers.  At the end of the sub assembly they put on vinegar, salt & pepper, oregano and mayo.  The meat tasted good and looked to be fresh.  Probably had a tad to much oregano for my tastes but not overwhelming; next time will probably ask to limit or hold the oregano.  My side order of fries were very good."}
{"text":"So I finally tried the new sub shop in our area Penn Station and was hopeful that we had a convenient place to eat that was better than the general places around...

Nope, but it looks like I had a better experience than most of the other reviews. Lucky for me the place was not busy and I got in and out with my Togo order in about 15 minutes (three subs, one hot and two cold and fries). 

But there's where the fun stopped, unfortunately I was reading the other reviews for the first time as I was waiting for my food. My experience was a bit different- none of the staff seemed excited to be there, more of the walking dead, and after reading the Yelp reviews I made sure I had my three subs and fries before I left. But when I got home I realized that they got my daughters order wrong (cold turkey sub mayo only - how can you mess that up!?!?) they put cheese on and no mayo... The other two were pathetic subs with no enthusiasm and the fresh cut fries were lame.

I'm feeling bummed - what a waste of a good location!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and grabbed a sub to go. I ordered the chicken and it was pretty tasty. It is real grilled chicken and took a few minutes to cook. They also had an artichoke that sounded terrific."}
{"text":"Gotta love Penn Station East Coast Subs! My brother from Cincy (they're the official sandwich of the Cincinnati Reds) turned me on to this place. They have wonderful cheesesteak subs! I get my with everything but the pizza sauce. The spicy brown mustard & banana peppers give it a nice kick. The bread is so fresh. Such good flavors in that sub. Usually I get mine to go so I don't get the fries. I'll call it in as I'm driving there, run in & pick it up. I try to get by there at least once a week if I can. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheese steaks I've ever had outside of Philly. Actually they are even better than some I've had in Philly. Fresh cut fries are perfection and the portions are massive. Don't get a large unless you have help eating it all or are trying to OD on potatoes. Really love this place. I go here whenever I'm in this part of town. Wish they'd open more locations in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I am going to be honest. I have eaten alot of sub's in my life... Penn Station has the best i have ever tasted....and the shape is beard friendly..... But the taste of the steak and cheese sub is unmatchable. Penn station won me over...not with service or company ethics but with extremely good food. The only bad side is i can not find anything comparable....Penn station is the best  plain and simple."}
{"text":"Great hot subs, fast service, good eats"}
{"text":"The quality of Penn Station subs is very good. The taste was also good.  I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms. It was made to order and it was hot and delicious.  I didn't notice the metallic aftertaste that I remember.  My family really likes these subs, so I guess we'll be back to try other offerings.

Good service too!"}
{"text":"So places that sell subs sometimes do salads and I stopped in for this.  This place is close to my new place and I'd never been before so I decided to check it out after work one evening.  I asked if they did salads and the worker told me they could make any sub into a salad.  I chose the chicken teriyaki and was shocked when I got home and opened the box.  They literally cooked chicken, cheese and mushrooms on the grill like they would for a sandwich and put it on top of chopped iceberg lettuce! Yuck! I will never go back! Gross, I had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Great people; satisfying, hot sandwiches and irresistible fries. I don't know what most people expect out of a sandwich, but theirs surpass whatever it is I might have hoped for. Wonderful, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside bread, generous cheese, spilling over onto the bread and making a nice little cheesy crust. Artichoke sandwich is my fav. Also, they have nice, tart fresh-squeezed lemonade. Yummy."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this location. The sandwich wasn't bad, but it seemed rather thin as if the bread wasn't given time to rise to the appropriate size. My fries were SUPER salty!!!! I couldn't even eat them. The environment was low key when I walked in and it seemed fairly clean. I will probably try this location again simply because I live close, but I'm hoping that this was a one time event."}
{"text":"This location being next door to my favorite beer and coffee spot is so convenient. Its always been clean and organized when I've dined. There's inside and outside seating along with a small to-go order table where people wait. 

The subs are extremely delicious and easy to split between 2 people with a side of fries. Lots of meat, cheese, flavors, and veggies. Just tell them how you like it! The price point for a big sub and fries was around $15 so its a little high if you're planning on eating it yourself for lunch. They do offer a small sub for about $7.

Once I just ordered a large fries, about $5.50 and it was huge, hot, salty, crispy... just perfect! The employees are nice and helpful. I was offered the malt vinegar and ketchup packets since I was a to-go order but they also have the malt vinegar in bottles if you're staying in."}
{"text":"Average. That just about sums up my experience here. I've driven by several times and always thought about stopping. I'm not disappointed that I did but I won't be chomping at the bit to return. 

Previous review mentioned that the employees were not wearing gloves. This practice has not changed and is a bit bothersome. Overall store isn't the cleanest and employees aren't winning any customer service awards any time soon. 

Food was decent. Nothing life altering and a little on the pricy side for what I got. Ordered five sandwiches and a large fry. The cheesesteak was by far the best of the lot. Fries were not evenly cooked and could have stayed in the fryer a few more minutes. I'd rather visit a Firehouse Subs for a superior sandwich. 

So if you read all this you see why the first line sums is up. Average."}
{"text":"Penn Station holds a special place in my heart, they pride themselves on delivering hot made to order subs using only the finest ingredients.

My only complaint is that the workers love their jobs so much they sometimes take a long time to make your subs because they savor every moment they get to serve their amazing customers"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars.  They don't wear gloves when preparing the food.  No hats or hair covers either.  No napkins at the drink station and the ketchup dispenser was empty and they had only been open an hour.  I like the food, but the unsanitary conditions were disgusting.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I just went there toward closing time and they were already completely ready to go, the grill was off, the food trays were already all wrapped up, and the 3 guys that were working were wiping down all of the tables. So when I walked in, there was a comment made about me walking in 5 minutes before close, then one of the guys (pale w/long black hair) wiping down the fryer throws down his rag and walks in the back. Then some other guy (Hispanic looking) walks out from the back, followed by the first guy and a third (tall white kid). They all looked at me like I was the one in the wrong for being being hungry and coming to the restaurant they work at right before close.  

What makes this bad is that they were not even able to serve me anything during business hours. I worked in a sub shop for years, the expectation is that you are serving food during business hours. You don't pack everything up and leave the second 10:00pm hits. That's when you should start clearing out the food, not walking out the door. 

My advice to these kids working here: Learn the  meaning of customer service. You absolutely never give the customer attitude, you never express anger toward a customer, and certainly never turn someone away before the end of business hours, it doesn't matter if it's 9:59:56pm you are there to serve the customer. 

My advice to the owner: Find polite kids and corteous employees that know they should be able to serve a hungry customer no matter what time they come in to your store. Otherwise close earlier."}
{"text":"I'm a sandwich fanatic, so I had to try Penn Station. This place has fantastic bread, which is certainly a necessity for a sub shop. It offers a nice variety of subs - even two vegetarian options, a grilled veggie and a grilled artichoke. I really enjoyed my grilled vegetarian sub and my husband enjoyed his chicken parmesan sub.

All of the employees were friendly and helpful, seeming happy to be there. One of them even recommended that my husband and I share a medium order of fries instead of each of us getting a small, so that we could save money. That's not something you see often in an industry that loves to upsell.

This location is too far to go for lunches, but I'll absolutely go to the one on South Boulevard."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice...I got the artichoke sandwich with mushrooms and chicken added.  The sandwich was delicious along with the fries!  The wait on the other hand was kind of ridiculous.  We called in our order, and they told us 5-10min when it would be ready.  We got there at 10 min after we ordered. Only 2 people were eating inside and 1 person ahead of me.  It took about another 10-15 min before I was fully paid, food in hand, and ready to leave.  I guess call ahead doesn't save you any time here."}
{"text":"seriously love this place. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The food is fantastic. The fries I don't care for. Don't get me wrong, they are good but I'm not a big fry person. The only downside is that they don't have combos. It's all a la carte. Price is good. You get what you pay for, for sure! And try the chocolate chip cookies at least once. You will be hooked! So soft and moist, perfect if you have milk handy. :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich this location they take care of you when your in a rush . I call my order in a lot and it's ready when I get there . Try the Dagwood with all the meats great sandwich my favorite. Their fries are fresh cut fried in Peanut oil great taste with some malt vinegar. Friendly staff and always offer condiments with order . Kudos Penn station!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. Their subs are delicious and reliable. I always get the Italian and it never disappoints. On Tuesday or Wednesday they give away free cookies with meal. They are bite-sized but very good. Based on quality of food I would never guess it was a chain."}
{"text":"Real good spot in Monroeville to grab a quick sandwich, hot or cold. Last time I went it was 30 minutes before close and the employees didn't mind. Fries were delicious too! Definitely go here if you want something quick and that tastes good."}
{"text":"Penn Station East Coast Subs was super quick and easy, and the people working there were so friendly! Ordered the 10\" Philly and it was delicious!

Didn't think that I was going to like the fact that they put marinara sauce on a Philly cheesesteak but I told them to do it anyway since it was there \"thing\" here... I ended up loving it! It was probably one of the best Philly cheesesteaks I've had outside of Philadelphia. 

Go here if you're in the mood for a good quick sandwich and you don't want the usually chains (Subway/Firehouse)! Fries are decent - kind of like Five Guys fries."}
{"text":"Went to the Strongsville Penn Station for very first time today. Although living a couple miles away, always overlooked this restaurant.  Couldn't have been more pleased with the service, the restaurant itself, the staff and the food.  We the cheesesteak, fries and lemonade.  It was the best cheesesteak I have had. Previously went to Fairlawn to get one, but no more.  This one beats it hands down. Fries fresh cut, and hot. Lemonade as good as my own. Everyone smiles when greeting you.  We will be back, and have an idea we will not be visiting Fairlawn any longer. Kudos to whoever is running this one."}
{"text":"The place just opened and I had fair expectations. I was there on their second day and again today.  I had a Philly cheese steak and an Italian sausage sub. Both subs were about as expected and would have been a lot better with different buns. They use those same hard buns that Jersey Mike's uses. It's what you see laying out on a buffet table, people put butter on them and call them 'hard rolls.'  The fries are fresh cut and fried in peanut oil, that's a plus for them.
They also offer fresh lemonade that can be purchased by the glass or the gallon. 

Otherwise the service was great-way too many employees, but I'm sure that will be adjusted. Everyone was courteous and friendly and apparently competent. 

A ten inch combo was just under 15 dollars, which I suppose is a little higher than average but I guess they have to pay all those employees some way.

I'll probably go again since I work and live close by, but I would go more often with actual 'sub'
buns."}
{"text":"avoid at all costs!!! they don't wear gloves while preparing the food directly in front of you. after i saw the guy wiping his hands off onto his dirty shirt i asked why he isn't wearing gloves. he stated that they don't have to wear gloves on food that isn't put on their conveyor belt for 20 seconds. purely unacceptable. bread and most deli meats are \"ready to eat\" which means you need to wear gloves when handling them. what if i didn't want my sandwich toasted? are you suppose to make it with your bare hands and give it to me hoping i don't notice?? no thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and food is really good, my favorite menu item is the Chicken Teriyaki Sub which in my opinion is best when ordered with extra Teriyaki sauce.  It was my last visit that prompted me to write this review.  During my last visit to this location, I experienced the best customer service I have ever had at a fast food joint.  I believe the fellas name was Julian.  Hats off to this guy for going above and beyond to make it the best fast food dining experience I've ever had.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Another sandwich place franchise in town, with several locations in Charlotte.  The one located on Remount is close to work, so lunch I went.  

Sandwich options is ok.  Chicken or beef mostly, cooked on the grill. There is cold cut option, but amazingly they have corned beef but not roast beef.  I had the Philly Cheesesteak while my bf had a cold cut turkey.  

Ordering process is a bit chaotic.  So the first person behind the machine only takes sandwich order and your name... Nope they don't care if you want fries or drinks or anything, just the sandwich and name.  Then you go down not even 7 feet to another person, who now needs to finalize your order and take your money.  The problem is if you want fries, she has to yell out to the kitchen staffs, who are between the 1st order machine and the cashier.  And all of the sudden Greg or Craig become an issue.  So why don't we just tell the 1st person to begin with?  End result is you may or may not have your fries when your sandwich comes out.  Awesome!

The food quality is nothing spectacular. I like the crunchy bread.  But they don't give you much meat for $4.50 6-inch sandwich. It's more noticeable when you dont ask for much filler items.  I almost needed a microscope to find the turkey hiding under the lettuce. 

The fries was good, but this is no Five Guys, these fries are not meant to be shared. 

And lastly the staffs there were a little unsympathetic for such a new place... If they don't care now, gosh they really won't care later. 

Good luck Penn Station, I think you may need it to survive."}
{"text":"Very fast friendly service when you want to get in and out and not waste time. The philly cheese steak sub with hand cut fries was awesome and hit the spot. There located next to Good Bottle by my favorite bottle shop in NC, and always plenty of free parking. Great spot for lunch !"}
{"text":"Great service, great sub. I went with the classic Philly Cheesesteak, though I did let them put mustard and mayo and some other veggies on it as well. Very tasty, very messy. Not bad for $10 for the larger sized sandwich (no fries or drink for me).

About two hours later, the carb drain hit me and I was out for a nap. So if you do choose to have a big sandwich, be prepared. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this chain and this particular location is pretty ok. Service is usually really fast and efficient. The food is fresh and tasty. Nice to have as an option during lunch downtown."}
{"text":"I've only recently discovered this place. I don't know why I've never gone before, I see locations everywhere. The steak and chicken parm sandwiches and fries are like crack. Can't get enough. The crew at the Centre Ave location are always so happy and friendly. Maybe it's the crack-like food? I'm joking, they're honestly sweet and patient kids."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! I treat myself to lunch at this restaurant every once in a while and from the moment you walk in, the service is excellent! The staff is very personable and accommodating. The subs are huge, they really hook you up! I highly recommend the grilled artichoke."}
{"text":"Is it weird I'm not really a sub/sandwich kinda girl?  I think it just ends up being way too much bread and not enough ingredients.  So I'm always hesitant to try these kinds of places.  This was a sort of \"out of desperation, I can't find anywhere else to eat that's really fast in the neighborhood\" kind of sitch.  Glad to have find this nice alternative.

If you know me, you know I hate Subway.  The smell, the stale ingredients, the horrible time of my life were I ate it for like a year or two straight (because of working at the Starbucks across from it).  YUCK!  So I'm ultra picky when it comes to sub shops.  This place really seems to have fresh ingrediants and a nice selection of subs.

I ordered the Italian sub toasted  The bread was delicious and also an Italian type.  Although I do love Italian bread, I do wish they had a wheat option, so I could feel a tad better about the amount of mayo and Italian dressing they put on it...which I loved by the way (I love me some sauces!).  I also wish they had put in a a little bit more meat and veggies.  I was left with about a quarter of the bread empty because I had eaten all the good stuff out of it already!  Still, it filled me up and was pretty tasty, and that makes me a happy camper!

It will now be added to the regular rotation of \"Fast Food\" options in the East End, and I'm A-Okay with that!"}
{"text":"Steak sub was decent, just enough meat, to many onions!
Fries great, nice and hot!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of their bread, but the toppings really offset this. It delicious, cheap, and satiating. I will most likely come here again."}
{"text":"Backstory: I waited to try a philly cheesesteak until I was able to go to Philadelphia to get one which wasn't until 2013. It was worth the wait. Since, I have made it my business to try phillys at any restaurant that sells them. 
Penn Station has the closest to the real thing in Charlotte that I have had. Yes it could use more meat and the bread should be seasoned with the meat juices but the flavor is spot on. It has the peppers and onions and mushrooms and all the condiments. This was hubbys sub and he was mad bc I kept eating his. 
I had the chicken parm. I give it a 'C' for effort. It's just chunks of chicken breast drenched in pizza sauce and then cheese. It's not breaded and fried like chicken parm usually is. It's not screaming to me chicken parm instead it scream pizza sauce with chicken chunks. There is absolutely no flavor other than pizza sauce. I was disappointed with this sub. Then my favorite came the french fries. They seemed fresh kinda like that guy restaurant that has five in the name. I enjoyed the fries and hubbys sub. I will try it again because unless it's just bad everyone gets a second chance."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I just went there for a quick bite. As I waited in line, I witnessed the manager take an order, touch several things  and without washing his hands or putting on gloves, start making someone's food. Worst part.. he was making a Philly Cheese and a piece of the raw steak was hanging off the bowl. So, once again with bare hands he grabbed it and put it back then with the same hand grabbed peppers for the sandwich. Forget how disgusting that is.. but it is a health concern since he is contaminanting the vegetables with raw meat. Then to top it off, he answered the phone and then put his hands back into the raw vegetables. Never once washing his hands or wearing gloves. I am pregnant and something like that can make me very very sick as well as make my baby sick. I walked out without ordering because I was so disgusted!"}
{"text":"I had to come in and try their new wrap! You can get any sub of theirs in a wrap and what's even better is that their monthly special for March is $6.99 for a wrap, a small fry, and a fountain drink. I got the hot club of course and it was delicious. I honestly think that their wrap might be more worth it than their subs in terms of size because my wrap was pretty large in comparison to a 6\" sub that I would get normally. But then again I didn't take the time to look at what the prices are for the wraps. Whoops.

The wrap was packed full of meat and veggies and it was so good. The fries are always delicious here even if they always give you less than you want. Service is still amazingly friendly and fast. All the workers at this branch are super great."}
{"text":"Penn Station is part of a chain that has arrived in Pittsburgh.  I think its pretty similar to a Quiznos but with different sandwiches.  I eat here for lunch every now and then and their subs are very tasty. I usually get the artichoke and it is just delicious.  They make their own fresh cut fries and that is the icing on the cake, they are fresh, greasy and salty (which is in my book what fries should be).  Sometimes you'll even get a taste of their homemade cookies with giant chocolate chips.  However they make their subs it seems like all of them have added grease in them, which is not really what I am always looking for.  
You can customize your sandwich when you order it, and it is printed on the ticket they use to construct your sandwich.  Unfortunately, 9 times out of 10, they don't look at the slip, and my order is wrong, and I have to take it back to the counter for a modification.  There are also some decent coupons for this place, but it is like pulling teeth to get either the person placing the order in the computer, or the person who actually checks you out to get the deal.  I always have to involve management if I bring a coupon.  
Hassles aside, the food itself is great if you're in the mood for a heavy sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've experienced here. Man taking the order was rude, had an attitude and doesn't look at you when you're ordering. Definitely won't be back and don't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Consistant service, quality, and good value.  Workers are very friendly.  Fries are excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub place. It's made more like a pizza, open faced and toasted and is really good. Share the fries, there are a lot."}
{"text":"No product. ...that's what greeted us at 4pm on National Sub Day. I can't believe there was no  product. Really nothing at 4pm in the afternoon. ... we're a family of 6. It's not worth traveling to a restaurant with no product"}
{"text":"Holy Hell. I can't believe this place has the worst service ever!  I was visiting a neighboring business and came here to grab something to eat to take home.

The first issue is you were supposed to order at the cashier at the end of the line instead of at the beginning of the line as you normally do. That should have been my warning, right there, But no, I went to the cashier and ordered my sandwich and fries with no drink.

I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited...for at least 30 minutes for friggin sandwich and fries.  One staff member asked me what I was waiting for and said my sandwich had been ready for 5 minutes but we were waiting on the fries. And I complained that my sandwich would be cold by the time the fries were finished.  The acting manager cutting the potatoes one order at a time. Let's wait some more..

I give them credit for trying to calm me down in my now irate status but it was not so successful.  The sandwich maker actually made another sandwich but yet the fries were still not ready.  

I asked for my money back and this was also a hassle.  The sandwich maker again tried to calm me down. Finally at least I got a receipt but still no meal.  It was now an hour after I left the neighboring business.  At this time all I wanted to do is leave Penn Station and go to McDonald's where I know my food would be available almost immediately.  After checking with my bank 2 days later, I never received a refund. The manager at this place has no clue what he is doing. I promised them that I would never be back. I'm just glad it was just a $15 meal that I lost money on and not more than that."}
{"text":"Well I tried a new place last week ! Me and Austin just ran in and had lunch on the fly.... It was Awesome the Philly cheesesteak is super yummy you won't be disappointed at all i think.. The staff was super helpful and nice and the restaurant was vary clean, its definitely one to frequent and we will be back !!"}
{"text":"Only giving two stars because of the bread which I liked. Got the philly cheese stake, added some mustard which I didn't ask for and made the sub horrible. My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki which was unbelievably salty, like burn your mouth salty. Could not eat it. Had to remake the chicken in the first place since it was made without the onions and mushrooms and everything. I think they used the same bread since the girl making the food asked if she could just make some onions and mushroom and throw them on instead of making a new sub. Maybe she added more salt or something but it was disgusting and inedible from the amount of salt. Even the Philly had way too much salt, on top of the fries with the salt, needless to say I did not feel well the rest of the day from the amount of salt and cheese consumed. I get you want to add cheese but again way too much cheese on both of our subs, like picking off globs and globs of cheese.  Cashier with the little Afro hair was so awkward, took the order wrong and we had to repeat ourselves three times. Overall will probably not be back or will have to special order the way I want my food. Please cut back on the salt tho!  

Tried again, so disgusting, bacon completely undercooked, salty salty salty! Will never go back"}
{"text":"On top of being soggy, the bread seemed pretty undercooked.  Cheesesteak was just ok - definitely have had better in Charlotte.  For the price, would rather go to Publix.
Fries are VERY greasy."}
{"text":"Been twice now and my first comment would be that they need more training on customer service, how to take an order, use the register to enter the order, deal with and prepare an order that strays into adding this or leaving off that...

In terms of food I've tried the cheesesteak and the hot club. Bread is decent, meats and cheeses are good quality. I've just never gotten the sandwich as I actually ordered it which is annoying. The fries are fresh cut and good as well. 

I may give them a few months to figure things out and try them again but the food is not good enough to overcome the service negatives so they better get on that training."}
