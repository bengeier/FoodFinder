{"text":"Went to give this place a try as I drive by it quite a bit. Went there on a friday at noon for lunch but I should have saw the signs when the place was practically empty. Only 1 table had people at it. I figured I would get what their namesake sells - the 'original' pastrami sandwich. I got it on rye bread (supposedly fresh) along with a side of cole slaw and a drink. Total came to $12.96.
When i first got my meal I was rather disappointed. For close to $13 I expected more. The sandwich did come with a fair amount of meat. Nice and warm pastrami. As for taste it was lacking. I had to go and get some mustard but as mentioned in other reviews it is rather dull. For 'fresh rye bread' it was DRY and bland. I slathered on the mustard and that did not help much. The coleslaw was loaded with mayonnaise it seemed like and tasted rather dull and boring. Even the pickle along the side seemed to have a faint hint of garlic but otherwise bland and tasteless. The pastrami itself was really good though. I could see myself going back and ordering that specifically from their 'deli' menu (they have a menu so you can take home amounts of meat/cheese/soups by the pound which seemed novel). I don't see myself ever going back here for lunch. There is a Subway a couple doors down and that works out better on the pocketbook. If you need a nice quiet place for lunch though this is your place! In the time i sat there and finished my sandwich only 1 other group pair came in and sat down."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The meat taste like it had been sitting under a heat lamp since the 80s. I am still thirsty from it being so dry. Please don't be tricked like i was by the clever name, and nice exterior. 
I want my money back ! If you want a Real , tender , zesty and taste-full pastrami ,Go to the Yardhouse at Town center."}
{"text":"First of all, I really wanted to like this place.  I've read such positive reviews and I was really looking forward to a great pastrami sandwich.  

I ordered an original pastrami on a french roll with potato salad and a soft drink.  The total bill was $12.88, so I would say a little on the expensive side.  The french roll and the pastrami were both very dry.  I had to keep adding mustard to moisten it up a little.  After every few bites, I had to keep taking a drink just to put moisture back in my mouth.  I've heard they make their own rye bread, so maybe that is better?

The potato salad looked good, but the seasoning they use is heavy on dill.  I don't like dill at all, and so that is all I could taste.  If you don't mind dill, you might like their potato salad.

By the end of my meal, I had most of the potato salad and the two ends of the dry french roll left on the table.  I ended up eating the rest of the meat plain.  

Maybe I just caught them on a \"bad\" day?  But judging that I was there around Noon (the lunch hour), and there were only three other people eating,  shows that this is not a local favorite."}
{"text":"Soooo I love Reubens and pastrami sandwiches.

I don't know how close the nearest Togo's is (somewhere in California, I'm sure), so I don't even try to get a decent pastrami sandwich anymore.

However, I felt the need to try Tommy Pastrami. Just had a craving, I suppose.
First off, it IS somewhat expensive. But there is no way you'll get HALF as much meat at Subway or Quiznos with their dumb \"$5 - tons of meat\" crap. Lies, lies, lies. I can barely eat the sandwiches. They are A MEAL. What a mistake getting fries. However, the fries are delicious. Just the way I like them. I didn't even need ketchup. So I guess it wasn't a mistake at all...?

The mustard is necessary for the sandwiches. I need some extra flavor.

I was too lazy to make corned beef/cabbage/potatoes/carrots - instead, my crazy Irish family is celebrating St Patty's this weekend. A reuben/pastrami with spicy mustard and crispy fries will have to hold me over 'til then."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the place. Not trying to be rude, the bread was stale. When we walked in there was only one other person during the lunch hour. Our order had several mistakes too. I would be hesitant to come back after this."}
{"text":"Worst place for a pastrami sandwich I ever went to, the pastrami itself was tasteless and bland it was not even pastrami it had the taste and consistancy of sizzlean, an insult to call this dried out jerky new York pastrami. Shame!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat for lunch (or maybe even dinner). 

This is a new casual eatery opened on Gibson Rd in Henderson. This is near my work, so I decided to try it out since I've heard good things about its California locations...

Well, I am usually not a big meat eater...but this place was excellent!!! Just like the name implies...you get pastrami here in addition to other succulent sandwiches.

The portions are HUGE!!! I got a \"small\" which felt like an XL pastrami. I am originally from the East coast, so let me tell you when I say that it was the best pastrami that I've ever had, it means a lot. The meat was tender, but not too much so, spicy but not overkill. Rye bread is delish and made fresh--you can really taste the freshness in this place from bread to meat--everything is super fresh and top notch.

The prices are a bit high for a sandwich place, but considering sandwich sizes and quality, it is worth it.

I also tried their liver sandwich, which was excellent as well.

With each sandwich combo, you either get a side of potato salad (pretty good, but not ground breaking in taste), cole slaw, chips or fries. Fries are excellent dinner-style and taste great!!!

Overall, I am glad that this place opened. It is definitely one of the best lunch stops out there. I would even try it for dinner if I ever so desired..."}
