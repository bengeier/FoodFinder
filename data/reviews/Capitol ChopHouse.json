{"text":"I gave an overall 3 stars because I took into considerationt these 3 factors: taste, price and service

TASTE: Everything we ordered here was delisioso! My husband and I had the wagyu beef carpaccio infused with olive oil, with capers, permesan and wonton skin for appetizer; and we agreed to give 5/5 for taste. The meat melted in your mouth, and everything combined together was so good. We told the waiter that we wanted to share everything, and we order the wedge (salad), prime ribeye bone in, and lobster tail. They were nice enough to split the salad to two plates (and big portion, i must say) but the taste was so-so (3/5). 
The ribeye and the lobstertail was superb (4.5/5). The meat was juicy tender and tasty. We also added crab oscar sauce on the side (for extra price), and greeen peppercorn sauce (free). The lobster was.. well.. fresh (I am not a big fan of melted butter for your seafood but I got no complain).
oh and gave you three different kinds of butter, all of those were soo yummy.

PRICE and SERVICE: Everything was expensive, and they didn't have anything complimentary for your main entrees. You have to order sides (fries, asparagus) etc., or even the sauce for your steak. I don't mind the price as much (considering the restaurant was part of HIlton Hotel, if I am not wron) but the service did not qualify for  a 4-star hotel at all. The waitress we had was slow, and she was not busy serving other customer. She spent much time talking with the bartender around the bar area. She was not aware that our surf and turf was missing the turf (lobster tail), until the manager pointed out that to her. She was not aware if we had our salad yet, and she was busy talking and drinking soda at the bar.  Thus, the price combined with the service was 2.5/5.

Combining the price service and taste, we decided to give it 3/5 stars. Had it been a middle-price restaurant, I would have given it 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I arrived late at the Hilton on a business trip to Madison on 8DEC08 and due to the snowstorm, decided not to venture out to eat. So I went to the hotel restaurant 'The Capitol Chophouse' for dinner. 

Due to the near empty state of the restaurant, only a large (~20) party in the back room and one other family of 4 a table away, I was seated immediately. The decor is neither unique nor offensive, jumping on the current generic steakhouse decor with the bar having the alcohol bottles on under-lit glass shelves behind it and the main dining part of the restaurant dimly lit with dark wood wainscoting and blood orange red walls. Flowers and vases stuck to that deep red and orange theme as well. 

I ordered nearly immediately. A petite (8 oz.) Filet Mignon ($34) ordered med-rare and a side of sauteed mushrooms and waited... and waited... and waited. It took 45 minutes for my order to arrive, by which point my waitress had already apologized three times for the delay, even though it was not her fault. 

When my steak arrived and I cut into it I was immediately dismayed to discover that it was not 'med-rare', but was instead 'well done'. Maybe the overcooking is why it took 45 minutes?!? No trace of anything even remotely pink in the middle. I immediately pointed it out to my waitress and she agreed and apologized once again. What was once a pretty good piece of meat was now essentially a dog chew toy. She asked me if I wanted another, but at that point I was too hungry to wait any longer. 

About halfway through my gnawing on the overdone steak the manager arrived and apologized, unfortunately he didn't offer to do much about it (reduce the price, comp me a cocktail or dessert, etc.). He only commented on how they had changed the mushrooms to a bourbon saute and asked my opinion. I agreed that they were pretty good as I had been smothering the steak with them in order to choke it down. 

I consider myself a BBQ expert and I know how only 30-seconds to a minute on inattention can completely alter the cook level and texture of seafood or meat. While I can't fault the service, if you are a steakhouse and you can't get the cook level on your steaks done correctly (and in a timely fashion) you need to fire someone in the kitchen and find someone who can...especially when you are charging $30-40 per steak and the place is nearly empty.

Considering the price (over $50 w/tip and w/out wine), if I make it back to Madison I'm taking my future business to Tornado Steak House."}
{"text":"Lee was our server and was great at giving advice on what to order. He gave us multiple samples of different sauces to have with the steak (which was awesomely prepared and cooked). I would recommend the scallops and of course the steak! Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went to chophouse and had a very good meal.  The waitstaff was very professional and clearly were top notch.  The food was good - but pretty standard.  I had an amazing soup, a pretty good Salmon but the dessert (some caramel dessert) was lacking. Nice atmosphere, amazing location.  A little bit pricey.  Worth the splurge downtown."}
{"text":"I'll admit from the start - I have only been to Capitol Chophouse during Madison's Restaurant Week.  With that said, it's a must on our list every season because out of all the restaurants serving lunch, it is the best value.

We started off with the tomato and mozzarella salad - our server let us know that the tomatoes were from the farmer's market and the basil from the restaurant's garden - and the \"onion gratin,\" aka french onion soup.  Both were nicely seasoned and solid dishes to order.  

We both ordered grass-fed beef burgers for our main dish and this is one of the best in Madison.  You ask for medium-rare, you get medium-rare. While that should be par for the course at a steak house, I have found a lot of places in Madison like to tend toward medium-well at least.  The budget is BIG and came with fries - so I decided to save half for later, which made for a tasty late night treat.

For dessert they had a cheesecake that sounded good, but neither of us could pass up peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  The cobbler was made in its own ramekin which meant the crust-topping went all the way to the edges and the fruit was warm until the last bite.  

For $15, you can't beat that deal and I'd venture to say it's worth a lunch time stop any time you are in the mood for a solid burger.

Also, a special shout out to the service here.  Our server, Candace, was knowledgeable about the menu, personable, and made the experience all the better."}
{"text":"We had dinner here during Restaurant Week and needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.  While I understand that Restaurant Week normally brings in a different type of clientele to Madison's more upscale restaurants, that is no excuse to provide terrible service.  Not once throughout the duration of my 3 course meal was I asked \"how is everything?\" \"is your steak cooked properly?\" \"did you enjoy your meal?\" Nothing. There was no explanation of the restaurant week menu either. By the time my entree was delivered my drink was empty, and I was never asked if I would like another. The extent of my servers comments were a simple \"here\" and \"you're welcome\". 

I was looking forward to the opportunity to politely share my comments with the hostess on our way out, but we were also not acknowledged then either. In my life, I have never given a restaurant or a server negative feedback. I also have never been treated more poorly.

Just thought that it would be worth sharing so that others who take advantage of an opportunity like Restaurant Week are not similarly disappointed by such rude service."}
{"text":"After a little snafu regarding serving times, the gentleman at the front was more than accommodating and solved the situation at hand perfectly!! I had a DELICIOUS breakfast and will happily come back next time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"I DID like this place until they discontinued my favorite gin. I was very impressed they had it in the first place (I had one). They assured me there was more but that wasn't the case. 
The bartender Lee, however, the day before, gave me exceptional service. The food is above average.

UPDATE:  I got charged $6 more for vermouth, even though I had it straight up without, but because I said \"martini\"???  Go figure!  Dumb   Downgraded due to being dumb"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 8 years as a hotel patron.  This place has really gone down.  I ordered my dinner at 6:30p.  No one in the restaurant.  2 people at the bar.  Finally got my dinner at 7:15.  A 45 min wait is unacceptable for a filet & green beans & no customers!  I really miss Mary the former bartender.  Current bartenders lack that great customer service you expect from such a pricey restaurant.  Wines by the glass are cheap brands at high price."}
{"text":"Good place, nice music. Upscale environment. Our waiter David was very nice and professional."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for restaurant week. The appetizer was salmon with seaweed salad. I thought the Salmon was exceptional, well flavored with an excellent texture. The seaweed salad needed sesame oil. My husband did not like the appetizer. Entree was scallops. They were well cooked, though seared only on one side (points off for that). I loved the silken texture and delicate flavor of the parsnip puree, but the spinach was bland. I thought it was ok, my husband was disappointed. For dessert I had the cheese tray, quite pleased with that (too full had it at home later). My hubby tried both other desserts as they brought the wrong one. I also tasted. Not a fan of the gingerbread cake at all, odd flavor combination. The Apple crisp was better but very strong cinnamon. Hubby didn't like it. I ate a couple bites and ice cream off the top. Asked them to pack the cheese tray and rest of dessert to take home, but waiter only did cheese tray and not the dessert which was barely touched. Points off for that also. Overall not the best experience, but decent. I would consider giving them another chance, but I doubt my husband would, he didn't like much at all about the meal or service."}
{"text":"I was staying in the hotel and tried the restaurant based on the scores. The food was good but not great. The wait staff is courteous and attentive and the wine list is good.  I had a halibut dinner special that was not on the menu.  As I said good but not great. Will be looking for other places while in town."}
{"text":"I was staying at the attached Hilton hotel and against all my rules, decided to eat in the hotel (10f and just stopped snowing)
I had the 16oz Prime Rib with mashed potato and asparagus.  The meal was very tasty, the service was OK, but the prices in this place are a killer.
$30 for the Prime Rib was pushing it, but to then have to also purchase the sides made this a $50 dinner and into the good, but not that good category."}
{"text":"This place is located in the heart of the capital city next to the Hilton hotel. 

They have a somewhat limited selection, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The sides are sold separate of the entree as is the case in most Chophouse's."}
{"text":"Had sides and drinks at the bar. Calamari is excellent. Prepared with tomatoes, capers and a lemon butter sauce. Superb. The Brussel Sprouts were very good.  This is a cousin to others in the Chophouse chain. Smaller than most, but high quality ingredients and careful preparation."}
{"text":"Review for holiday buffets only.  My previous experiences were great  but in the past two or three years the quality and number of offerings has declined.  At one time they had terrific crab legs and they declined over the years and at Thanksgiving they had none.  It is just not worth the money any more."}
{"text":"I can't say that this is my favorite upscale place in Madison. But the ambience is great - my boy and I visited here on our first official date!

The steaks are good, you can feel safe here asking for a black and blue (which is even rarer than rare!). Seafood is good here too. I like it here, but my favorite thing is the bread and butter!!?!?!?! There's always 3 different kinds of butter/cream cheese - 1 regular and 2 special flavors. so gooooooddddd. Otherwise... I'm alright about this place.

Ambience is great but somehow the tables are too huge when a couple sits across each other.. A little loud to chat across the table though. 

In summary, come here for a special night to get steaks done just the way you like or for some lobster Mac and Cheese ;)"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 5 stars not because of the food but because of the service I received, i felt like i was in a 5 stars hotel. 
I had the salmon croquettes that came with asparagus, this was like eating butter, delicious and great combination. For my main entree i had the Dry Aged Rib Eye, i asked for it medium done, this was also delicious but i think fresh pepper would have enhance all the flavors. 
To finish i had a raspberry cave with mint ice-cream. 
I came here by myself but the waitress checked on me all the time to make sure i was okay, he also suggested my appetizers and dessert. He was the BEST WAITRESS that has ever helped me, he also looks like a man taken out of a movie lol"}
{"text":"I was there for a group dinner.  Overall, the service was very good. I felt bad for our servers, because we also were having some \"official business\" discussions that could not be interrupted, and the staff was trying its best to be attentive while not bothering us. It's a very delicate line to balance for them, but they handled that wonderfully. 

I ordered a 20 oz. bone-in rib eye.  It was a very good steak, and perfectly prepared and served. The sides were fine, but nothing special. 

For the life of me, I can't figure out why they would offer a Wagyu flatiron steak. A flatiron is not really anything special to begin with, and why a restaurant would offer such a \"high end\" offering of a rather low-end cut of beef is hard to comprehend. I asked our server several times to inquire about that with the chef, but never got an answer.  

The desert lineup was pretty standard. A seasonal special was the egg nog creme brulee.  Aside from being poorly conceived overall, it also was served badly. There are two theories on creme brulee. One is that the custard should be chilled and the caramel crust on top should be hot.  The other is that ithe custard hould be served warm, and the caramel crust on top should be very hot. In this case, it was neither. Luke warm custard and luke warm caramel crust. Neither tasted particularly good. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. 

The atmosphere and decor at this small restaurant were quite nice, but the service and food made this entire meal an unbearable experience.

The server rarely stopped by our table even though there were only about a dozen other people in the entire place. This includes not delivering our drinks, bread, or food. The only time we saw him was to take our order (which did come out quickly) and deliver the check. He didn't even run my card or return with the slips in order to thank us for being patrons.


The food at this a la carte restaurant could definitely be of higher quality for the prices they charge. For 8 dollars, I expect mashed potatoes to be smooth and flavorful, but got the exact opposite...lumpy and bland. To top it all off, we ordered asparagus as a side as well and it arrived unseasoned and undercooked.

Will not return."}
{"text":"I went to the Chophouse for Restaurant Week.  Many years ago I had lunch at the Chophouse during Restaurant Week and it was wonderful. Their regular prices are out of my affordability range so I was excited to return.

My dining partner is a very old (not in age, of course) and special friend and we have very similar taste buds. We both heartily agreed that the dinner was lackluster at best. We were deeply disappointed.

Our server was excellent. He was knowledgeable and attentive. 

The best part of our meal came first. I had a wonderful wedge salad that was exactly what I had hoped for. Well-chilled iceberg lettuce, a bit of bacon and creamy blue cheese  dressing. My friend had house cured salmon that was tasty and light. Both looked as good as they tasted.

For our entree I had the steak and my friend had the scallops. The scallops were \"fine\" but I didn't hear any moaning which is not a good sign. My steak was lacking flavor and it wasn't very tender. I ate about a third of it and took the rest home. I don't think I will eat the leftovers.

We ordered a trilogy of sides- asparagus, baked potato and something else I can't remember... again, \"fine\", not a word you want to hear.

Last but not least was dessert. We ordered one pear and one apple dessert. They were boring and cloyingly sweet. Again we left most on the plate.

Dining out is a treat for me. I do not have to spend a lot money to be wowed. But every now and then I like to treat myself. I took a chance and for $60 I was terribly disappointed. I drowned my sorrow at home by grabbing an ice cream treat from my freezer. Now that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"A typical steak joint with a menu you would expect of a Wisconsin superclub. I have eaten here several times, and it always seems to have a business crowd (i.e. Hilton guests who talk loudly about work). The steaks are cooked approximately, as ordered, and the apps & sides were good. But there are better steak joints in town."}
{"text":"Very clubby. Good steaks. Excellent service. Expect to pay premium prices"}
{"text":"went with a group.
had a good table in a private room; had some apetizers, oysters, shrimp coctail, crab cake.
the crab cake was not good, other appetizers were good.
had the t-bone 24 oz steak it was very good although it was more rare than a medium should be.

all in all, it was good but very pricy."}
{"text":"Nice menu with a variety of different cuts of meat. My boyfriend and I both ordered the new york strip. I ordered truffle butter and Bearnaise sauce with mine, and my boyfriend ordered a blue cheese crust for his. The steaks were cooked well, and tasted great. The truffle butter was great, but we were both a little disappointed with the Bearnaise sauce. We also ordered soup (french onion- made with a brown ale for me and clam chowder for him). Both were very good. We shared roasted garlic mashed potatoes as well. The meal was very good, but I agree with other yelpers that it was a bit pricey."}
{"text":"9/26/13 My wife and I had dinner at the Capitol Chophouse.  We enjoyed an appetizer of scallops, shrimps, oysters, and crab legs.  For an entrée she had the Black Earth pasture raised lamb and I had the Black Earth grass fed rib-eye.   We also enjoyed a bottle of pinot noir by Archery Summit's Red Hills Estate.  If you want steak or seafood dine at the Chop (end of story).  :-)

They are part of the downtown Hilton Monona Terrace Hotel and will validate your parking."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton Monona Terrace Hotel and felt like getting a dessert after dinner. I went over and got the creme brulee which I was able to take back up to my room. The dessert was average and I did not finish it. I cannot speak to other menu items here."}
{"text":"Ok steak, expensive, really poorly trained staff and inedible vegetables. Ordered veg trio. The asparagus was cold, tough and coarse, the half of a baked potato had been dried out under a heat lamp. My glass of wine came from a bottle that had been opened for at least a day and was off but the bartender stated it was vacuum sealed so it was fine."}
{"text":"Great service!  Amazing scallops.  The bread was the best part - not kidding, it was delicious!!! Wedge salad was also delicious.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Meh.  It was OK.  We were in Madison this past weekend for our 1st Anniversary and I really needed to find a place the first night that I could make reservations at seeing we were dining with our 7-month-old daughter - weren't sure how she was going to handle a long dinner out -  and I also needed a place that well, makes a damn good steak.  I figured it was safe to assume that something with Chophouse in the name would make a decent filet.  

Things started off very promising.  Our server, Liz, was incredibly nice and was wonderfully sweet to us and our little girl.  She was very apologetic when it took a ridiculous amount of time to receive our first course - carpaccio and she even removed it from our bill.   She was great and she is the reason for one of the stars.  Finally after the carpaccio - which was quite delicious, not overly flavorful or brilliant, but good enough - we received our Caesar salads which were actually brilliant and delicious and receive star number two.   Though, in a \"chophouse\" a salad should NOT be the highlight of our meal.  FINALLY, our steak comes out.  We both ordered a filet done medium rare and while their level of doneness was not an issue, it was just the most absolute boring filet I've ever spent $38 on.  It was completely unseasoned and looked like it came off a Weber grill out back.  Scratch that, a filet off a Weber grill out back would have been far more delicious.  I was expecting something far more luxurious - a nice solid sear, etc.  This did not meet either of our expectations at all.   We went with the a side of mushrooms and they were pretty good.  By no means the best damn mushrooms I've ever eaten, but they were pretty good.  All in all, this place was a big miss for us and left a bit disappointed.  I kept saying we should just got to Ruth Chris', take our daughter to a chain, it'd be easier, this and that and dammit - we should have.  

We certainly wouldn't make any effort to go back here, nor would we recommend it to anyone else.  The food just did not match the price point they seem to believe they're at."}
{"text":"I've only been here once because Capitol Chophouse sucked my wallet dry that day.

I had the 18 oz. ribeye, which was juicy and tender. The Capitol chop salad was pretty good too. I have absolutely no complaints about the food itself.

But I just can't justify coming here. The $$$ sign on Yelp should be changed to $$$$. Capitol Chophouse is definitely a pricey restaurant. I'm assuming it's because rent downtown, and especially within a hotel, is high. For the price you pay, there are surely better options out there. Try Tornado if you haven't already. Costs are more or less the same, but the quality and options are a lot better."}
{"text":"Hilton Monona Terrace has always treated me exceptionally well, so it pains me to give this restaurant such a low score. I ordered the chop salad and the ceviche. The chopped salad was delicious - finely chopped, tasty blue cheese, zesty dressing. Then the scallop ceviche came out ... the scallops were canned, the avocado was the type you fine in a bag that gets squeezed out, and there were 2 sprigs of cilantro. By far the worst ceviche I've ever had, and after 2 bites - my stomache turned. 

Maybe the other dishes are better, but my ruling is this is just another hotel restaurant/bar. There is better food not a half mile down the street at Graze and Et Tiot. I will walk there next time."}
{"text":"Drawn in by the festive Christmas decorations outside,but disappointed by the overall experience. Although our server was very accommodating with our dietary restrictions, the food was awful. Shrimp cocktail was flaccid and smelled like chlorine, fried Brussels sprouts were inedible ,burnt beyond recognition, grilled broccoli was raw. The quality of the steak did not warrant the price. Would not recommend!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a trip to WI the last week of June. We wanted a special night out, so we went to Madison and happened upon Capitol Chophouse. I'm glad we did. The service was great, the food was amazing (I had the grass fed ribeye), and the ambiance spectacular. I loved the historic building and the retro furnishings.

Thanks for a wonderful evening out!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I've had better and the prices were higher than the better that I've had.  This was table wine in a champagne flute.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst steakhouses I've been to in Madison.  The food was absolutely terrible.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because the salad and dessert I got were decent.  Otherwise everything about the main dish was bland, unseasoned, and undercooked from specification.  I even tried the other dishes people in my table had gotten and they were all just as bad.  If you're in the mood for a steakhouse that's downtown I would recommend going to Delmonico's instead."}
{"text":"since we can't give half stars, i'm giving two (but you'll all know that i really mean 1.5). 

just so this isn't entirely negative, let me start with the good: our steak was cooked well, and the sweet corn fritters were probably the highlight of our meal.

alright, moving on. i came here for restaurant week, and as corey d. notes in an earlier review, this visit became a way for me to find out that i do not ever want to eat at this restaurant again. the restaurant week menu was full of things i love eating, but i had seen the mixed yelp reviews on the food and the service, so i did have some reservations about spending my money here. but i thought, everyone on the menu seems like standard steakhouse fare, how bad do you have to be to screw that stuff up, right?

welp.

for appetizers, we had the aforementioned sweet corn fritters and the caprese salad. as mentioned, the fritters were the highlight of our meal. it helps that i'm a sucker for all things sweet corn, but these were quite delicious and they weren't too heavy or doughy. the caprese salad was underseasoned. 

for our main courses, we had the grilled flatiron steak with a chimichurri sauce and roasted cherry tomatoes on the side, along with the king salmon fillet in a sun-dried tomato vinaigrette with spinach. as mentioned, the steak was cooked well, but my girlfriend found the salmon tasted fishier than she'd like. on top of that, the sides were god awful. both the tomatoes and the spinach were way overdressed, to the point of being inedible. they were limp and soggy and just unappetizing to look at. thankfully, this was one situation in which i was happy that the portions of sides were so paltry.

to close out our meal, we had the chocolate brownie mousse and the raspberry sorbet. the mousse didn't have much of the lightness or smooth texture that you'd normally expect of a mousse. the brownie was hard and unpleasant -- i didn't even know it was supposed to be brownie bits until i looked at the menu again. the raspberry sorbet was actually quite good, and mixing it with the mousse actually made it palatable. 

i get that we were ordering from the restaurant week menu and the portioning probably wasn't the same as it would be had we ordered from the regular menu, but still -- it's sad when we're asking for a second round of bread after we've just eaten the main course. 

speaking of asking for a second helping of bread, the service was just as atrocious as described by some of the other reviewers. again, i went in totally expecting that the service might be a bit slow due to restaurant week, but this was just ridiculous. the place wasn't even that busy, and the dining area wasn't so large that our server couldn't see what was going on with us or how our meal was progressing. either he wasn't very attentive/perceptive, or he just didn't care. i would have been okay with it if our server stopped by our table right as we were seated just to say, \"hey, i have to attend to x, y, and z but i will be with you as soon as i'm done!\" or something along those lines, but, you know, more tactfully/respectfully than the way i phrased it. any acknowledgment would have been nice, honestly. after our food came out, our server was once again nowhere to be found. we flagged down multiple different servers for more bread and more water throughout the meal. we had a different server bringing us water and a different one bringing us our bread. our server did check in with us to see how we were doing/how the food was... at the very end of our meal. neat. thanks.

count me among those who were massively disappointed with the food and the service. what a waste of $80+."}
{"text":"Where else would an engaged woman meet her future father-in-law (FFIL) for the first time? A steakhouse, of course! 

Last night's dinner was not surprisingly good. The ambiance was just right and the bar was a beautiful greeting into the place. That was the first thing I noticed for some reason. 

Lee, our server, was very knowledgeable about the menu and was attentive without overdoing it. He recommended the crab cakes, but we opted for clam chowder, french onion soup, and a Caesar salad. Although they were all delicious, I really should've just ordered the darn crab cakes! My FFIL loved his clam chowder: definitely not fishy. My fiancé liked his french onion soup, but he said not as much as he thought he would. The beer in it, Ale Asylum's Madtown Brown Nut Ale, may have contributed to that opinion. My Caesar salad was as good as I expected: it's a no-fail salad, I think. Not too much dressing but not dry either, not too much parmesan. The ciabatta crouton and the anchovies were a great complement to the salad. I wanted more!

We all ordered the tenderloin; I had the smaller 8 ounce portion which was more than enough for me since I inhaled my salad. The special for last night was scallops along with the tenderloin, which they both had. The steaks were cooked to our liking and the scallops looked beautiful and tasted even better. The sautéed mushrooms were not a disappointment, although I wish we didn't order 2 of them. I really wanted to have some spinach, man. Oh well, next time.

Dessert was warm apple crisp. The caramel ice cream wasn't too sweet. The crust on top was a little too much sweetness for me (WHAT?!) so I bypassed that and dug into the bottom for the apples. Mmmmm! 

Overall, a satisfying (and pricey!) dinner. My goal for next time is to try their fish selection and lobster mac and cheese. Hopefully sooner than later!"}
{"text":"We went for restaurant week. The food was good, the service excellent, the atmosphere nice. My husband's steak was not the best steak ever, so perhaps at full prices we would have been a bit disappointed, but the rest of the meal was quite good. 

We brought our baby and felt comfortable. There was a range of people dressed casually to very dressed up, and the restaurant had a pleasant buzz but was not loud."}
{"text":"Great mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked filet! I loved it! Service was a fine, but the restaurant smelled like seafood...not the best atmosphere. Delicious food nonetheless."}
{"text":"I rarely go to restaurants located in hotels but because it was late and I was tired I tried this one in the Hilton Hotel. Very good food! It's on the expensive side but the grilled salmon on a plank, cauliflower, served with fresh bread and Wisconsin butter was very, very good. I had a cheese plate, all from Wisconsin, was excellent too. Recommended if you're looking for a steak/seafood kind of place. It's very close to the state capital too. Hmmm."}
{"text":"Absolutely Terrible. I had high expectations for a restaurant of this price point. Wow, was I disappointed. I have had better food and service at McDonald's. We had drinks in the bar first, and the bartender made a mistake on one of the drinks in our party, nicely came by to apologize, and ignored our empty glasses. 10 minutes later we were able to hail her for another round. Then, on to dinner. Our bread arrived 90 seconds before our food, but note we waited 60 minutes for our food. The appetizers were overly salted and gross. My steak was literally rotten, and that didn't even warrant an apology. The prime rib my partner ordered was almost as bad as my rotten steak. The service was slow and non-existent - we waited again forever for a drink, much less the bread. The chowder was ok, but for your money you are better off going to Outback. At least their chowder is hot, tasty and their service actually exists."}
{"text":"After a couple of drinks at the Olive Lounge, I walked across the hallway to Capitol Chophouse. We got nice seats by the windows, it was weird seeing the people who live next to the hotel trying to do a BBQ out in the cold.
Started off with red wine and white wine. Love the huge wine glasses, but it makes it hard to keep track of how many glasses you are drinking. Started off with nice warm rolls with 3 types of  butter: your normal yellow butter, sundried tomato butter (amazing!) and jalapeno cream cheese. The sundried tomato butter tasted so good, must be because of all the fat oh well. I had a Caesar salad for an appetizer and oh my gosh, it was huge. They were very generous with the cheese too and it was delicious. For my main course, I had the special of the day which was halibut with a thin crust of hashbrown on top in white wine cream sauce. The fish was very soft and the cream sauce was oh.. so creamy. The sides are huge and meant for sharing. We got the mushroom which came with pasta. The mushrooms had some truffle oil and smelled amazing.
I wish I could have desert but I was too full.
I forgot to mention about parking. If you park in the hotel (Hilton Madison), its $3 per hour, you might want to consider parking on the streets."}
{"text":"Due to errors made by the Hilton staff that night, I honestly wasn't optimistic about the quality of the food. But boy was a proved wrong! I ordered the Salmon for dinner, and it totally hit the spot. The presentation of the salmon resting on a bed of spinach, Israeli couscous, and dreamy, creamy sauce was just the bee's knees. Though it seemed like it wouldn't be enough food for a tall guy like me, I was definitely satisfied by the end of the meal. 

**I would say, though, that Israeli Couscous is NOT plain couscous. They should make the distinction, for the benefit of gluten intolerant customers, especially.**

Meanwhile, the bartender, Amanda, was a joy. Her drinks were superb. Her attitude was positive. She was as helpful as could be, conversational, and funny. I will definitely be going back to see her again.

The breakfast, I'd say, was less exciting than dinner. I felt like the effort was just lacking, in comparison. For example, the grapefruit juice didn't taste fresh. The omelette was luke-warm when it got to me (and they were not busy). However, the toast that came with my order was amazing. Whatever they're doing to the bread, they should continue to do! :D"}
{"text":"Came here for Restaurant week because I can't afford their regular menu normally.  

I had the NY strip and the boyfriend had their salmon.  Both of these are also on their regular menu, I believe.  The atmosphere here is intimate and cozy.  Even though we were seated not 4 steps from a larger table of 6 people, we were never bothered by their conversations.  For whatever reason, I kept getting lost in this place as I couldn't figure out which was was in and which way was out.  

The bread is fresh and I enjoyed it, especially with their accompaniment of sun dried tomato butter, sweet cream, and honey cream cheese.  My favorite was the honey cream cheese.  

My NY strip was tender, but the baked potato it came with was pretty average.  The salmon wasn't especially impressive either.  I had an appetizer of mini shellfish sampler which came with an oyster, half a crab leg, and a jumbo shrimp, which was pretty good but I wasn't wowed.  Everything was fresh, but there was nothing special about the preparation.  Although, I find this to be pretty much the case in general with steakhouses.  Tender beef, but not much else that's noteworthy."}
{"text":"When we lived in Madison, this was a frequent date night stop for us.  Typically, the service is really great, the ambiance is romantic and the food great and consistently great.

I am a fan of the little things.  I always enjoy the different spreads to begin the meal. I once had a cherry butter that was amazing but has eluded me since.  Their shrimp cocktail and chop salad are fantastic.  I normally go for the bone-in ribeye which is great.  Please remember that medium at most steak houses means slightly red in the center which is just the way to order it.

I like that the food is often local, the deserts are great and change with what is in season.  

I truly miss this place.  A recent visit to the \"best steakhouse in Seattle\" has left me longing for the chophouse experience."}
{"text":"I tried king crab legs and lobster tail tonight. They are so great! And I enjoy the environment and service very much."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet:

Wine - a delicious Syrah.  There were plenty of reasonably-priced options to choose from.

Appetizer - Clam Chowder.  Yum!

Entree - I got the king crab legs.  They came pre-opened, which I love because then I do not have to get messy.  The legs had plenty of meat on them, and tasted/smelled/looked freshly-caught (Which I always appreciate when I'm hundreds of miles from an ocean).  My date had the filet.  I tried a bite and it was delicious, but I still prefer Tornado (Although I'll give Capitol Chophouse another chance).  We got a twice-baked potato as a side dish.  It was ENORMOUS.  It was also delicious, so I highly recommend you order one (Maybe to share).

Dessert - Creme Brulee.  Perfect finish to a great meal.


I can't help but compare my experience at Capitol Chophouse to my past experiences at Tornado.  The menu options and prices are very similar.  I've tried the crab and filet at both restaurants, and if you forced me to choose I'd have to give a slight advantage to Tornado.  Having said that, eating at the same place over and over can get stale.  If you're looking for some delicious seafood/steak offerings and want to switch things up, give Capitol Chophouse a try."}
{"text":"I still love this place. 
Most recent April 2013 brought about the freshest clam chowder that hit the spot during the dreary-never-happens rainy-Seattle type weather that we kept having. 

Sorority sister loved loved her mini-chopped salad and her previous experiences were less than stellar the time she visited before. 

The Cuban isn't a first nor tenth choice but everything else at lunch works. 
FYI: the seafood mac & cheese is best when eaten while at the restaurant. It doesn't heat and eat well the next day. I'm serious.... take my word. It just doesn't congil/conjil well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both love this restaurant. We ate here twice during our four days stay in Wisconsin. Cheese Goat brie is awesome. Lamp chop is awesome too!"}
{"text":"We are out of town guests and have been told that the chophouse is a place to go. So we went and it was just a sad experience. Our server was trying too hard. The ambiance reminds me of early 1990. The onion soup was plain and no flavor. I had the filet which was great but my partner had the strip and it was over seasoned. The mashed potatoes were just overly salty...wouldn't recommend to anyone...oh the manager came by but we had already finished...overall not good"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment, especially for one connected to a hotel.  There steaks are very good and the service is very professional. I recommend the chopped salad for a real treat"}
{"text":"was staying at the hilton and didn't want to order room service, the weather was bad outside so decided to treat myself to a nice dinner. my server was very nice and provided wonderful service.  she told me about the half orders of the sides and mentioned how generous the a la carte portions were. 

i had the chopped salad (half order) and the prime rib and mashed potatoes (half order) and i really enjoyed every bite. couldn't finish the prime rib and potatoes so i consumed when i returned home."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night.  Let me clarify that it was not my choice to eat here.  While the yelp reviews were mixed, I most certainly gave it fair shake.  

First, it took forever to get the Waiter's attention to order our wine.  Then it took forever to order our appetizers.  We ordered the Shrimp cocktail and oysters on the half shell.  The shrimp were good and plump; the cocktail sauce was tasty and had a nice little bite.  The oysters were half heartedly shucked.  Made eating them difficult.

For the main course I ordered the 6 oz filet.  I ordered it \"bloody\".  What came out was more medium rare.  The lobster mac-n-cheese was way over cooked.  And the cheese was a congealed mess.  The creamed spinach was pretty good.

For the price of the meal, the food came up way short! Would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mary is great!  others comments about her are spot on.  sensitive to the needs of those at her bar.  the Chop Salad is fabulous.  don't miss it.  curious to try the other offerings...  wish I hadn't had so many snacks earlier in the day...  I suspect the kitchen is well run.  my food was lovely and quickly received.  fresh.  pretty.  made me want to eat slow and enjoy every bite fully.  wish I had the appetite to accommodate the Restaurant Week menu...  maybe tomorrow?!"}
{"text":"You must try the bone in filet. One of the best steaks I have ever eaten. It was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. Had excellent service both for dinner and a recent brunch trip. Bottomless mimosas, salmon fritters, and lox Benedict. Delish!"}
{"text":"If you want an excellent dining experience from friendliness to cleanliness and awesome food in between, look no further than the Capital Chophouse! The menu had a varied selection that should please any palate. Our waiter Renee took excellent care of us, our drinks were supreme and the hostess Olivia was delightful.  The food was outstanding! We can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Good, not great. For the price, there are better steakhouses to choose from in Madison."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed.  Was slightly confused about where you are supposed to enter since we weren't staying in the hotel, but once we found the hostess stand we were seated right away.

This place was packed but it didn't feel like it because the ambiance and lighting were so well done.  I loved the pictures and the decor.  The waitress was very friendly and knew what she was doing.

We ordered two bottles of wine and immediately got warm bread and homemade butters which were fantastic.  I ordered the steak and potatoes with the fresh seafood appetizer.  The appetizer was perfect and great and the entree was even better.  My steak was cooked to a perfect Medium Rare and I ate it all.

The prices were extremely reasonable given the portions and service and I would certainly go back again!"}
{"text":"nice, but kinda pricy for that quality... well since it's at Hilton, should see that coming. btw, the cheese there is really tasty, I bought some extra to enjoy back home."}
{"text":"I ate my filet mignon with a plastic fork. Talk about tender. Omg best steak I've had in a while!! Everything was so good!! Hubby got the NY Strip and LOVED it. Mashed potatoes, grilled broccoli, clam chowder. All was so amazing!! Bread was the only disappointment due to it being rock hard but the rest makes up for it! What a yummy dinner in the comfort of our hotel room!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for a celebration of my best friend's engagement.  Price wasn't a concern for such an occasion.

The service was great, exactly what you'd expect in a high end establishment.  The tuna tar-tar and oysters were amazing.  Three of us got the prime rib.  It was the best I've ever had (well, next to a place that has been closed for a decade).  Perfectly bloody and tasty.  My girlfriend went with the Filet Mignon.  I almost regret her choice, she is continually begging me to take her for it.  I don't think I've been to a steak house that had better food.

And, to top everything off, I had a Beer Float.  Yes, beer and ice cream!  If you're an adventure eater like me, this is worth the trip itself.

The price tag and location are the only drawbacks.  I didn't like parking in a hotels huge ramp and then finding my way there.  Other than that, this is phenomenal steak house."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for work. I always sit at the bar. If Mary is working, you will have a great experience. Great drinks, excellent food and phenomenal service. There may be better food in Madison, but you will not find better service."}
{"text":"The service was awful.  And painfully slow.  Only three tables with guests at 5 pm and it took nearly an hour to get our dinner.  After we told the waiter we had a show to be at that evening.  And when the waiter was questioned he copped an attitude and became even more scarce.  

My steak was cold so that took another 10 minutes to remedy.   By then we had to leave for our show so my meal was a huge disappointment.  

Oh and the menu is nothing like what is listed here on yelp.  Save yourself the frustration.   Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"As a restaurant in the Hilton, it is overpriced for average food. I'm torn between giving this place three stars versus four stars because I did enjoy what I ordered, but it cost a lot.

I ordered salmon, which came with steamed spinach or chards if I remember correctly. The salmon was good and whatever the sauce on top was good as well, but nothing special. I also had a side of lobster mac and cheese - delicious, but so obvious that they use whatever is left of the lobster besides the tail to make it. (The lobster tail is another item on the menu.)

My boyfriend ordered the New York Strip. I'm no meat expert, but he said it was decent."}
{"text":"We checked out the menu and reviews before coming to Capitol Chophouse, so we knew the place was going to be very expensive.  Our review isn't really going to take cost into consideration, because we don't think that you can put a price on the high quality of food that we were served.

There were six people in our party and we ordered a large variety of food.  Starters included a Ceasar salad, Roasted Beat Salad, Wedge Salad, and Clam Chowder.  Main courses were the 14oz dry-aged Ribeye, 18oz bone-in Ribeye (wet-aged), 12oz New York Strip (wet-aged), Sea Bass, Salmon, and Tuna.  Sides were two types of spinach, creamed corn, and lobster mac.  We finished the meal with multiple desserts.

Despite so many main course orders, each dish came out at the same time and cooked perfectly.  My 14oz dry-aged Ribeye was cooked exactly Medium Rare and was probably the best steak I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  My wife was so happy that her Strip was cooked to her specification of Medium (pink throughout, warm, and firm).  We didn't try any of the fish dishes, but they looked perfectly cooked and appetizing.  

Each of the side dishes came out family style, so we were able to share each one.  Our favorites were the Creamed Corn and the Sauteed Spinach.  The Creamed Spinach was good, but we are more accustomed to a drier, baked version of the dish; Capitol's version seemed more like a creamy soup with spinach in it.  The lobster mac was good, but we didn't find much meat in the dish, but plenty of flavor.

The food was amazing and the professional service just sealed the five star rating for us.  Quick, friendly, and knowledgeable waiters.  All of our questions were answered perfectly (I didn't know the difference between a dry and wet-aged steak) and all of our dishes were impressively served perfectly and simultaneously.

We recommend Capitol Chophouse for a couple looking for a romantic meal in a sophisticated setting or for a large business party with multiple tastes.  Everyone will be satisfied with their meal and happy about the great service."}
{"text":"I've been in here since this place took off. My roommate's friend was working here at the time when the chef was trying out new menus.

I love the cozy downtown darker dining experience and the restaurant has an overall upscale feel which compliments the meals that come out from the kitchen.

Get a good deal on dining during Restaurant Week which this restaurant regularly participates."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week last year and definitely will not return.  Our waiter was snobby and seemed like he didn't want to wait on us but only did so because he had to. We got the prime rib sandwich and it just did not live up to our expectations in any way. The meat was better on its own and was tough and hard to eat. I won't be recommending this place as I feel it is overpriced and overrated for the quality of food and service."}
