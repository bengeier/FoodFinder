{"text":"I realize at this point this might be redundant but I just had yet another sub-par experience at this restaurant. It took an excessively long time for our appetizers to come and everything seemed cheap and crappy. Presentation was bad. It took quite a while again after our appetizers for our mains to come. My mom commented to the waiter and he replied \"2 min\" without even going to ask the kitchen what was up. It was definitely longer than 2 min. When the food came it was less than delicious. My pork and my brother's steak were extremely tough and clearly the cheapest cuts from the grocery store. My mom was not happy with her sardines either. The food was edible but not enjoyable at all. I could have made something better at home. In addition, none if their menu matches what is on their online menu and I found this annoying and misleading. People reading these reviews: listen to them!! This place is not worth your time or money when there are so many other good eats in Kensington."}
{"text":"Their food is good and the service is friendly but both can be improved. 

However their patio and live music saturday nights is amazing... You will love it if you like listening to beautiful music and eating...over several ours..not rushed. Beautiful...feels european more than american/canadian."}
{"text":"Amadeus has a nice atmosphere; my friends I thought it'd be a safe bet. I don't know if I caught them on a bad day, but boy was I wrong.

Our food didn't arrive for 30-40 minutes. The restaurant was nearly empty. When the waiter brought us our drinks, he spilled water on my friend's phone and instead of apologizing, chastised her for having it on the table which I found a little strange. I wouldn't have minded the mistakes if his behavior wasn't so defensive.

After lunch when he brought us one bill and we'd asked to have separate bills, he said he couldn't bring us a new set of bills after printing. This would have been fine, since he figured out the different totals. However, after I'd paid with cash and my friend tried to use debit, he told us debit wasn't taken for purchases under 15 dollars (I don't think there's any sign in the bar area that says this; could be wrong). This would have also been fine, since there was an ATM literally right beside us, if he hadn't continued with \"This is why you should have paid for the one bill. One of you could have used your card and just paid the other back.\"

The food itself was super underwhelming. For 10 bucks I got a plate of chicken Caesar salad that was basically a handful of old lettuce with a couple croutons, barely any dressing (I mean, I don't like drenched salad but it was dry) and sub-par chicken. My friend's fish fillet apparently tasted/looked like (as someone already commented) a frozen grocery store item.

Poor food. Rude waiter. Maybe it varies between dish and employee, but it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend who is Portuguese and he suggested that I get the pork sandwich and fries. I found the sandwich to be decent, especially because of the onions and peppers they topped it with. This place has a small upstairs area by the bar if you want a more intimate scene and also a basement area where you can host parties. I would return if I was in the Kensington area again and maybe in the summer where you can sit on the patio!

Don't forget to stop by the churro shop after your dinner for some dessert!"}
{"text":"the food did not taste good.
the service was decent.
would not go there again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Amadeus since I was a child.  My parents would take us here for special occassions and some events.  The food is just as good today.  

The patio and bar are awesome weekday afternoon hang outs for those that have the luxury or skip a day to watch some soccer.

I go back atleast once a year, and tho the service is slow and has taken a hit since Mr Amadeus passed (his daughter now runs the place) the food makes up for it.  Best to make reservations for dinners as the place is small and they hold a lot of group events.  

Being Portuguese and living in the old part of the city I've tried a lot and Amadeus makes the best Carne Alentejana and overall their food is far superior to other Portuguese places in the city.  

They offer a dinning, bar, patio and take out experience so you can enjoy great food in different ways!!"}
{"text":"I had a really nice dinner here.  I ordered the vegetarian burger  - it is actually vegan and it is made from eggplant and black beans - it is made from scratch and it tasted good.  The bun was fresh and tasty.  The best part was the delicious home made hot sauce which was so good.  The server told me how they make it from scratch and it takes weeks to make in barrels - yummy.

While I waited for the entree they brought complementary bread which was soft and fresh...

I would recommend this resturant."}
{"text":"Below average food, slow service, dirty basement washroom. Their only saving grace is the Kensington patio. 
Came here with a group of 7. Everything served was underwhelming, cooked with subpar ingredients. Pasta was overcooked, bread (with whipped butter) was stale, gritty mussels, pale and limp fries."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend. I got the lasagna and she got the fish platter.  Both were not good at all.  My lasagna was dry and overcooked with hard crusty edges.  The tomato sauce tasted like it had been poured out of a chef boyardee can.  My friend's fish looked like the fried frozen fish fillets you find at the grocery store and she told me it tasted like that too.  It was also very overpriced for the kind of food you are getting.  I am not sure how this place continues to attract customers and how it manages to hold onto its spot on this prime piece of real estate.  

I'm giving this place two stars instead of one because the service is good and it was enjoyable sitting outside on the patio."}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating here. Grilled sardines, dried cod (bacalao) and clams were basic and good with decent sides. Blends in well with the pot and beer atmosphere of Kensington"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant service I ever got.
The server was incredibly rude, unprofessional, judgemental and, actually quite stupid. And when I asked for the manager/owner, she never showed up. 
I agree with Bruce E., Avoid this place like the plague!
We went up Augusta Ave to the Indian taco place and got a wonderful service."}
{"text":"This is just for the patio, not the food. 

Came here last week with a friend from out of town. Wanted to show him some of the sights of Kensington. Patio was nice enough and they served the rum and coke nicely ( they gave you a can of coke and you could add as much as you wanted for taste)"}
{"text":"A cautious 3 stars.

The corner spot on this patio, under the tree, is one of the very best vantage points in Kensington for people watching. Randoms will even come over and beg for money or try to have a nonsensical chat with you. Nice shade, intermittent sun and free entertainment!

Beer and bottles of wine are the way to go here. The mixed drinks are usually watered down.  I always regret spending money on the food here, as it's usually a miss. The servers are among the grumpiest I've ever encountered. Not even a trace of a smile or the will to help you. They even seem pissed off that they have to bring you drinks. I blame the management. I think they're treated pretty badly by the boss, here. There's no other way to account for the fact that they're ALL having a bad day ALL the time. Obviously, it's not me-- cuz I'm awesome.

If I can get my seat on the patio, I'm all good. It's also a nice break from all the hipsters crowding all the other patios in Kensington. But be prepared for some attitude and eat before you show up here or have something planned for after."}
{"text":"Great service, and unique menu. The Portuguese burger was fantastic! Our table also enjoyed the Portuguese-style steak! Wonderful views of Kensington Market. Stop in for a quick drink!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague!   Way too overpriced for the location and service given."}
{"text":"The location is very good and the food is ok - just a bit overpriced for what it is. You can get much cheaper food around Dufferjn St, with identical quality. Solid place, though."}
{"text":"They have the worst calamari ever. Really thick, over-cooked, and chewy. The sauce was a mix of cocktail sauce and ketchup. Nice to sit on patio in kensington market, but the food I tried was awful."}
{"text":"We stopped by the neighborhood with intentions to visit Kensington Market, but the sudden downpour of heavy rain led us to find shelter and a place to grab lunch. Passed by this place and decided to give it a try.

It's a Portuguese restaurant, but the fish filet with chips I ordered didn't seem very Portuguese. However, it was pretty delicious for what it was. The sub sandwich was very soft and the fish filet was crisp, fresh and not heavily deep fried. The fries were the antithesis of soggy and delicious with the whole meal. The patio seating gives you a great seat outside without being directly in the sun, or in our case, away from the pouring rain.

They have some jazz bands playing on the weekends, as indicated from the posted flyers, so this place must be a happening locale at night. Might come back to check it out if I'm ever in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Came here with my Portugalphile parents this evening.

Reasonably priced, you get legit Portuguese food.

Service was superb - attentive and quick to meet our requests.
When the parental unit meet someone from Portugal, they get really, really, really excited. Our poor server... however, he entertained them and they seemed content to talk about their favorite country.

Food was delish.
I had the chicken with wine and mushrooms smothered on it. 
Simple, but awesome.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amadeus is fucking awesome!!!

What a perfect patio for drinking and chillin away the afternoon with some tru neighborhood peeps.  And the musical talents are a-class.  My hubby and I split the grilled sardines, they were totally cool and split the plate for us and it was delicious.  Great sangria, too.

Good times, these are the good times."}
{"text":"This is a traditional Portuguese  restaurant with \"home cooking\" flavour.  Do not order pasta here as Portuguese people know nothing about pasta.  I ordered the Portuguese steak $19 and comes with potato chip fries, a fried egg and steak in a sauce all served in a clay plate.  Their shrimp soup and collard soup are really good.  Chocolate mouse is home made and very rich flavour.  If the weather is nice and you sit on the patio it's great.  The restaurant is dated and the music is mellow - Brazilian. Service here is always really good."}
{"text":"Good Grilled Calamari plate. The patio is a good place to hangout.
I tried their pasta, is not soo good - although it comes with yummy sea food on top of it.
Their sangria, No - I wouldn't drink that again."}
{"text":"Service was poor as we had made reservations online and the server indicated that they didn't have a reservation and just said, meh it happens. Then after when we asked for separate bills he went on to say that they couldn't and told us, well most people just charge it to one person's card and pay that person in cash. I believe I know how to divide the total by 9 people and I don't need to be taught how to do that. Obviously I wanted separate bills for a reason. The waiter also spilled water on me and my purse and did not even offer me another napkin to help wipe it off. I also refused to use the bathroom after my cousin used it and advised against it due to the strong odour. 

All the food was also overly salty. The \"risotto\" was not really a risotto as it was swimming in liquid and all the seafood (which we had a lot of) was over cooked and at times slightly burnt. Also, the prices are not printed on their online menu but the two $$ as indicated on yelp is not accurate it was more expensive than that. Overall I will not come back to this restaurant again and am surprised that it had 4 stars when I had chosen this restaurant off of yelp."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and they just came out with this amazing new platter which I really enjoyed"}
{"text":"The review is for the front part of the restaurant.  Was here Easter weekend so the patio and the dining area were closed.  The restaurant is located in Kensington and gets quite busy in the summer - especially the patio.  

The front part looks like a dingy bar...to be honest not what I was expecting.  I had the calamari and wasn't impressed.  No flavour, it didn't have that beautiful texture that I was looking for.  They had a goat special due to it being Easter and the 3 people who ordered it said it was delicious.  So perhaps the calamari was frozen then and not fresh.  

I will however say the service was great!  Very attentive and always making sure we had what we wanted.  I would go back to sit on the patio - however not sure if I would spend money on food though."}
{"text":"While strolling around Kensington one of my friends was particularly hungry (it was Halloween Day and Seven Lives Tacos and Rasta Pasta, both on my must-try list were closed, what gives?!) so she chose this place because I think their Halloween decor stood out to her. Which in retrospect is really not how you should be picking where you want to eat.

Aside from the Halloween decorations this place doesn't really have any ambience and the tables are really small. Our group of 5 were placed in a tiny circular table where we were basically elbow-to-elbow. You get complimentary bread but it was obvious it had been sitting out for a while because it was cold and unappetizing. Because I wasn't very hungry and just looking to warm up, I ordered their Green Collard soup which came with Portuguese sausage. The soup was a disgusting, salty, gross mess with 3 minuscule pieces of sausage.  The rest of the table got fish sandwiches + fries which were mediocre.

I think this place stays open because of its seedy regulars. The group of middle-aged men yelling at each other and shotgunning beers midday, while an elderly woman was going to town on a bowl of prunes was pretty funny to be in the midst of but I'll never return."}
{"text":"We loved our dining experience at this place. We were a group of five and ordered a variety of items: cod, halibut, steak, seafood bisque. Everything was very tasty and portions were generous. Shout-out to our server Cassandra who was very sweet and friendly. This is a family restaurant and it really feels cozy. Live music on the patio added to the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service was rude and not attentive. When I advised the waitress of my dissatisfaction the owner never came over to address.   Sangria was very good. My calamari was unable to be eaten. I returned it."}
{"text":"So it is Kensington! So expect \"ambiance\" inside and mostly outside. 

Family owned restaurant/+great patio. Food is traditional, simple, priced right and service is top notch - especially when family is in.

Recommend getting a (or two) pitchers of sangria. Definitely one of the best in the neighborhood - again, that is awesome Kensington."}
{"text":"It was Civic Holiday when my mother craved for Portuguese take-out. Having read some of the horrific reviews, I decided to take a chance for its convenient location and I'm glad I did. Elizabeth and another gentleman were attentive and patient from the start. I ordered soup, grilled sardines, cod fish a braz, chicken breast and the tomato pork chop special. 

Realizing I didn't drive (I'm petite) and I'd have trouble carrying such a big order, Elizabeth offered to call me a cab. Other than the cod fish stir fry which could have used less salt, a a tad less oil, everything else was pleasant. I don't think I will make an effort to visit, but I may stop by if I'm ever in the neighbourhood for an authentic Portuguese meal."}
{"text":"It was ok.
Food was ok.
Great atmosphere. 

Drinks and snacks kind of place.  Great place to watch the opening of The World Cup 2014!"}
{"text":"I had an excellent time at this restaurant! I had dinner with my parents in this restaurant and, apart from the delicious food and the atmosphere that transports us to the cozy Portugal, the staff is very friendly. Super well located and with a very affordable price. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice patio facing Augusta Street; great for people watching.

I ordered the Pork Alentajana. Didn't know what it was but it seemed like it was one of the restaurant's specials. My girlfriend got the grilled chorizo.

The pork alentajana was okay. Its basically pork and potatoes in a sauce. It was pretty salty. The pork was dry, maybe overcooked? Not sure if thats how the dish should be though but i like soft and tender meat. Portion size was decent but not worth $18.25.

The grilled chorizo was pretty good, seemed a little dry.

Some positives: they gave free bread and butter. The bread was cheap but I appreciate that they gave something. When we finished a basket of bread they gave another without us asking. Their refill game was on point as well."}
{"text":"My husband is from Portugal so my cousin suggested Amadeu's Restaurant for our last meal in Toronto.  The restaurant has a beautiful patio and is located near the Kensington market.  It was Sunday so there was a nearby street fair going on and parking was difficult.  A word to the wise, read the parking signs or you will end up with a ticket.

Anyway, we sat outside on the patio and were served by a lovely Portuguese gal and guy who checked on us frequently.  My husband spoke to them in Portuguese and that seemed to make them smile.

The menus were in English and Portuguese and were a little ragged.  They need to reprint and re-laminate them since they're a little old and worn.

We ordered a cheese plate and some shrimp for appetizers and most of us had a steak dish covered in thinly sliced potatoes.  It was delicious, flavorful, and authentic.

Not sure why there the reviews are so negative on here, but I can only imagine it's because of the reviewers themselves.  It's a really nice spot, a little on the expensive side and not somewhere you would go to eat everyday, but a perfect spot for a romantic evening or to bring out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef burger and fries and spouse ordered the fish of the day with potato salad. Extremely disappointed with the burger as the patty was extremely small and tasted just ok.  Tried it but won't return. Lots of better places to eat in Kensington market."}
{"text":"I'm being nice with 2 stars, and only because my first experience here was good.

This second time will be our last.  We arrived on a sunday.  It wasn't very busy, but we were left sitting for so long, we started to wonder if they'd even noticed us coming in.  The waitress seemed out of her element, had no idea what she was serving, and was more than careless with our orders.  I went with my husband and my best gal pal.  We all ordered the 8 oz. surf and turf dinner.  My husband asked for medium, my girl, well-done, and myself, med-rare.  

Thirty minutes after ordering, our food hasn't yet arrived.  We've eaten all our bread and start to get fidgety.  In comes our ever-lost waitress.  She has 2 of the 3 meals ordered.  Of course, it's mine that isn't ready.  I ask the waitress, more just out of frustrated sarcasm then to actually get an answer, \"So why is it that the steak that needs the LEAST amount of time to cook is taking the longest to reach our table?\"
To which she literally sneered at me and said \"it's coming just wait\" (?!)
Finally my food arrives, and my hubby and pal had waited for me to begin their meals...and..my steak is well done.   wtf...
I look at my husbands steak, thinking, perhaps they've given him mine.  Nope!  His is well done too.  The only one of us that got what they asked for was my girlfriend.
So now I'm eating overcooked, tough, grissly 8oz and I get to my last piece....I pick it up and discover....oh YES...a dead insect!

At this point, my patience has reached it's limit.  I'm not one to make a scene, but I do expect to eat a $35 meal sans winged creatures swimming in the meat juice *ick*
I don't lose my cool, but calmly call over our hopless waitress and point out the offensive creature.  She promptly takes away my food (I'm still starving because I hadn't even touched my side dishes) and brings me my bill...

She charged me for the meal!!!!  I couldn't believe it!  I told the manager I refuse to pay for it but the lady insisted we pay and got really b*tchy.  Not cool, never going back!"}
{"text":"After aimlessly wondering around Kensington Market  for half an hour we stumbled across this lovely place.

One thing that really drew my attention to this place the lovely blues music I could here from a block away. We ordered the Paella which was seasoned very well. moist..It was a beautiful thing. I also got a fish filet sandwich; once again well seasoned with lettuce and tomato served on a bun. It was busy, so the service was a bit slow, but definitely worth the wait.   

I strongly recommend you pay a visit  to this place..you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great service, bland codfish.

Not very representative of what I would expect from such a flavour filled fish. A delicacy of the Iberian Peninsula."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The patio is awesome, and the live music fantastic.  The waitress who served us, also Portuguese, had a really interesting sense of humour that I thought was hilarious.  Her facial expressions were pure gold.

The only thing I didn't like was the smoking that pretty much every person at every table around us partook in.  Apparently I didn't get the memo."}
{"text":"One star for the patio. Prime view of Kensington. 
Frozen hamburger patty and a handful of frozen French fries. Terrible. 
Patio for drinks may be fine but there will never be a reason to eat there. Just don't. Really, just don't. Far better places in Kensington at more reasonable prices. 
Leave this place to the unwitting tourists."}
{"text":"Went here last night in search of an early spring patio treat when all the other Kensington options seemed too crowded.  

The service couldn't provide any details on their annoyingly inadequate menu descriptions:
\"What comes with the fish?\"
\"Potato. . .(long pause) veg.\"
I'm not sure if the server is new but the whole order-ordeal was quite laboured.  Another server took his place as his shift had ended, and she was far more on the ball.

I ordered the fish sandwich, which was okay but it seemed a bit soggy and the bread was inappropriately large for the size of the fillet.  It came with a surprisingly small amount of standard-issue fries.  

One of my friends didn't get what he ordered; instead, a reportedly disappointing steak sandwich was served.  My bf got the same fish sandwich as I did; he wasn't blown away but he commented that it was fine--he was quite hungry though :).  

All our food took a long time to come as we shared a pitcher of beer. 

With all the other options in the area, this place should up its game a little to remain competitive."}
{"text":"The service was very slow, we ordered fried calamari , fish sandwich and Portuguese burger. The food was not good, the fish sandwich felt very plain, nothing special. The pork burger is made with some kind of processed meat that has a strange taste."}
{"text":"Amadeus is an institution in the market and has been there as long as I can remember. Funny enough after years of walking by we finally decided to try it out because I was craving sardines for dinner. Sitting on the northwest corner of Augusta and Denison Square the place consists of three separate little rooms, a more formal dining space, a bar and outside seating both in front and facing Bellevue Square. Because there was a soccer game playing on multiple televisions throughout the space we opted for the more formal dining space. Situated on the north end of the building it featured a selection of tables backed by a bar at the western end of the room. The menu filled with Portuguese inspired dishes had lots of fish and seafood options. I ordered their grilled sardines and a Portuguese pineapple drink (that while sweet was really yummy) while my friend had their cod dish. The service provided by an older gentleman and a younger waiter was really attentive and the food really delicious. The sardines were exactly what I wanted. They were salted and grilled with some grilled peppers, and boiled potatoes as accompaniment. My friend's cod dish consisted of fried salted cod, eggs, potatoes and olives and he too was happy with what he ordered. The food and the service made it the perfect way to end a beautiful, warm Saturday."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Good service. Good food. Spacious patio.

I ordered the cheese and prosciutto platter, the bitoque steak with an egg and batata chips on the side. Not bad!!"}
