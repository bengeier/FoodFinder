{"text":"I love Duke's! One of the best neighborhood bars I've ever been too. Great bar food and good wait staff keeps me coming back. In addition to the karaoke and bingo on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Server was an ass, left before we even ordered. I know Dukes does not care, because they were busy. They won't ever miss my business, and they will never get it. F, you to the ass server."}
{"text":"Great food, burger was awesome!  Sirloin salad-fantastic!  Friendly staff, 18 year anniversary party, Marley Taylor rocked the house with live music!  This place has it all, sports, patio, dance floor and super menu!"}
{"text":"This is a great all-around \"go to\" place. You want to grab a bite or a cold one with a old friend, or a (very) casual first date with a new someone? Tastey food, reasonable prices, decent service, sports all over the place, pool in the back. In a town where douchebag nightclubs come and go faster than imaginable, theres a reason why Dukes remains."}
{"text":"The owner is (for lack of a better phrase), a business-incompetent jerk.  I will NEVER return to Duke's. There are amazing restaurant choices nearby that I highly suggest everyone support.  Bad business should not be encouraged."}
{"text":"A bunch of Co workers and I went here for lunch thinking of breaking the normal lunch time routine.  Well the experience was terrible to say the least.  Our waitress lost our simple order and came back to us a half hour after she took our initial order to admit it.  Things happen, Its understandable.  But another half hour goes by with  no signs of our food or even a heads up when it might be coming out. Now we are late coming back from our lunch break and we just wanted to pay for our drinks and go. We felt as it was forced upon us to stay and did not feel like it was right.  So long story short. She did not give us any discount on her mistake,  they gave us to go boxes.  Messed up everyone's order in the to go box,  and each paid 13 dollars for a lunch that tasted so un-cooked that half of us ended up throwing it away... If you do go here..  Just make sure you have plenty of time to hang out."}
{"text":"Used to be our favorite sports bar but last time we had a waitress with a bad attitude and was not even cute, looks like a meth head!! Dont they know if they hire good looking girls with a pleasant attitude, they will get more customers, going elsewhere, dont need service with an attitude!!"}
{"text":"Headed to Dukes to watch the Montana football game as they have a satellite they show the game with. The past few years we have been fortunate enough to see the game at home on Root Sports or Altitude.  This is one of the weeks the game was on neither. So off to Dukes we trekked from Glendale. First of all when the game is on at noon you should not be waiting till noon to find your satellite feed. As  we have gone  sporadically in the past 5 years this has become the norm. Wait till noon to find the game. Spend the entire 1st quarter trying to find the game. Someone finally hooks their computer up and we see 30 seconds of game and 10 minutes of buffering.  Don't plan on watching the game if you are expecting to. The owner should be offering a discount to all who sat there that ordered food and drinks. Not my idea of watching a game at a sports bar. I will say the food and drinks were great as usual.  Believe me I have eaten there more than once without being able to see the game. I also see you have removed all the booths and put in foosball tables leaving 
even less seating. Might I suggest moving your pool tables into that same room and putting all those tables into the middle room which is much lighter and would provide more seating . Also you might want to think about upgrading your satellite if you are going to consider yourself a site for Montana football."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot.  They have a pretty decent selection of beers on tap, for reasonable prices.  Plenty of TV's.  They have two rooms of pool tables, with more tables than the majority of bars in Phoenix.  Most importantly, they have all of the sports channels.  As a Boston fan, this is the only place that I've found that has NESN.  They are very willing to put on a dedicated TV for you if you ask...not always with sound, but it's better than nothing!  Plus, there usually aren't too many college douche-bags there, so it's generally a chill atmosphere.  Also, their back patio is awesome, as it looks out onto the greenbelt, rather than a parking lot like most places in the valley."}
{"text":"Dukes Well Vodka got me sick?? I never get sick from drinking, if you go there Don't order any well Drink from Dukes. I called management after getting sick and to let them know they might have bad well Vodka, and the Manager Al kept making excuses on how I got sick and started to argue with me. He didn't even say sorry. I won't be going to Dukes any more and if you go there hopefully you don't get sick too, Jaime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't bring my bottle of water in because it's a health violation? Dafuq? 

You can't give me both fries and tater tots with my burger? Dafuq? 

Your system can't split our 3 pitchers of beer between 2 people? Dafuq?"}
{"text":"I have my favorite servers. Great service, love my Tuna Steak Cesaer salads! Thanks for caring: Jesse, Jenifer, Shawn, Megan, Monica, and cooks Jesse and Jason who do the best job of cooking the Tuna Steaks. To make it perfect, make the Tea stronger and the Ranch dressing thicker."}
{"text":"Like seemingly every sports bar that exists, has ever existed, or will ever exist (in this reality or those realities of the alternate variety) this place is pretty average, decent, perfectly fine, OK.

I mostly come here for the trivia and to grab a beer or two.

The food is fine, typical pub fare. Nothing special or particularly impressive, but gets the job done if that's what you're looking for.

Not a place I'd go to if really wanted a nice meal and super tasty food, more of a drinking, watch a game, play some shuffleboard type of place. Same as any other sports bar."}
{"text":"Now that the head chef went to another restaurant the kitchen is disorganized. They knew tonight would be a busy night with the asu college game but they still ran out of the daily special. I think this is piss poor management from an owner who has supposedly been in the bar business for 30 plus years. Maybe he should pay more attention to his business instead of if he has a full drink in front of him. The servers are great and friendly. The bar would be dead if it wasn't for his daughter running this place during the day. On dozens of occasions a random non-Arizona sports game has been on the main screen instead of the diamondbacks or coyotes game. This might as well be a dodgers home city bar because the dodgers are always on the big screen. When we ask the bartender if we can watch the diamondbacks they say the owner is at home watching the bar on security cam and wants the dodgers on. Does he think the dodgers will bring more business? 
Lol...forget ever coming here if you are a  hockey fan. The owner hates hockey and it's never on the big screen. This bar has only survived this long due to the area lacking good restaurants. Hopefully that'll change soon with the new development happening on McDowell. The only reason I come back to this place is because it's within walking distance. He needs to remember that there's  more on than shitty Montana football."}
{"text":"I've been going to Duke's for a long time. The service is decent and the food is average. But recently something made me decide never to go again.

A few weeks ago, I was sitting at the bar and I noticed that there was one girl there who is an LA Kings fan. It was the night that the Kings eliminated the Coyotes from the playoffs. She was (needless to say) excited. She didn't appear drunk, nor was she obnoxious nor taunting the many Coyotes fans. However, I witnessed the owner demand her to leave. I felt this was unfair, as it seemed the only reason he had was simply because she was cheering for the opposing team.

I've been to Dukes when the Lakers were the star attraction, so you can't tell me that this is an \"Arizona\" bar. She was treated unfairly. Period.

Because of this fact,I will not be back. There are far too many other sports bars (with better food, better service, and may I say better hospitality)."}
{"text":"THE WORST BAR FOR DRINKS........stay away from this place.  The food is very bad and greasy and don't complain because you will get asked to leave... the owner is a complete jerk and drunk most of the time.... if you go stick to the beer the bartender has no idea what she is doing...The places is filthy....just go when the lights are on!"}
{"text":"Well so far this is my favorite spot to go. Staff is friendly, even to me. And food is good, California burger with potato salad. My new go to food."}
{"text":"We used to love going to Dukes on Wednesdays for trivia.  Then they changed their menu, increased their prices, and didn't change the level of service.  I've never been treated so rudely as I was tonight.  I will not be returning to Dukes."}
{"text":"If you like the elderly and are not a minority its the place to go!  
If your too loud they kick you out or come over and tell you to be quite.  
Not the place for people looking to have fun."}
{"text":"I come out to Scottsdale every year in March for one weekend, to do two things: to watch spring training baseball and watch the opening rounds of NCAA March Madness all day at Dukes.  And it's heaven.  The service at Dukes is friendly and attentive, they have good bar food, and a bloody mary station to get you going in the mornings.  They have more tvs set up than you could possibly ever need, with multiple rooms that cut you off from the main bar area so you or a group can watch your own game on a big screen with volume.  It's a real sports bar that knows how to run it's tvs and put the best games on.  They have multiple pool tables, buck hunter and shuffle board."}
{"text":"No stars even though the wings are very good.   Are they worth 12$ per order of 10 ?  I don't think so.  We went in to watch a game. Just me and my two boys.  Each had a order of wings and fries.  They kept bringing us refills throughout the game (not telling us they were a 1$ each for refills.  Over all for some wings and fries  and multiple refills that were a DOLLAR each , our bill for lunch of wings and fries was over 65$.  Are you FUCKING shitting me ?  Service was slow at best.    It's such a shame.   Good wings just to get shit on.    Don't think I'll return for that kind of abuse."}
{"text":"From my door, it's a five minute stroll through the greenbelt to Dukes. They have a nice patio. They have enough TVs to show all MLB/NFL/NBA games. They have plenty of shuffleboard and pool tables. Yet, I've only been to Duke's a few times and I am not going back. This place is just bad.

Mixed drinks use cheap mixers (such as bottled sour mix for margaritas). They offer a pretty basic beer selection at a rather high price point. I think PBR pitchers might be more modestly priced, but that might be only when they're on special.

The food is pretty bad, even for bar food. And pricey. Sure, the menu is gigantic and I've tried many different items, but I didn't find anything good. Everything seems to be made from freezer-to-fryer or packaged products. I'm not exaggerating: the burger and fries for about $8 is a thin, previously frozen patty with a handful or supermarket fries. I could go on about salads, sandwiches, and ribs. In the same price range, you can get a much better version of anything on the menu at Four Peaks or Zipps or even Devil's Advocate.

One of the owners was there on a few occasions. I guess being the boss of (and drinking in) his own bar is some sort of dream of his. He treats the place like his kingdom. He'll ask patrons \"how is everything?\" and get mad at them if they have anything negative to say. I feel bad for the rest of the service staff; they seem to be above average, but when the overall situation is this bad it just doesn't matter.

In this city, sports bars are a dime a dozen. I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Finally a place to watch local sports with sound.  I always find it unbelievable that many sports bars here in town look past our local teams and support the foreign hoards from Wisconsin, Minnesota, NY, Illinois etc..  Not at Dukes...local first.

Please return to your frozen tundras and leave us with the Suns, Cardinals, Devils and Coyotes.

The food here is nice bar/pub fare and is always fresh and hot.  Drinks are plentiful and service respectable.  Would like to see a little more variety on the taps but other than that Dukes is a great place to catch a game."}
{"text":"The beer was not cheap, and the food was horrible. I'm pretty sure it was frozen food they heated up in the microwave and sold to me for like 12 bucks. What a scam!

The only reason I don't give it 1 star is this would be a fun place to go to hang out and watch a game or play pool, but don't expect it too be cheap. I think you could get cheaper prices on Mill or Old Town."}
{"text":"Such high hopes I had for Dukes.  Opening night of the NFL...exitement is high, the place is packed.  We're eating, drinking, watching the game, the crowd is into it, when mid way thru the 3rd quarter, a microphone comes on interferring with the NFL broadcast, announcing its time for TRIVIA!!!!   WTF!!!!  Its opening night of the NFL and you're holding a trivia night!!!!!  Unf***king believable!!  This is a \"SPORTS BAR\"?????  I mean...what can I say!!!  I'm so tired of \"sports bars\" playing karaoke, holding trivia night or playing music while the SPORTS are on.  We immediately closed our tab and left.  The most pathetic part was that the waitress advised if we moved to the back where the pool tables were, we would not be able to hear the trivia!  How 'bout you move the trivia back there and let the NFL fans watch the damn game!!!  Very, very sad.  Sports bar??? HA!!  What a joke!  BTW, my wife ordered the \"full\" order of ribs, expecting a full rack, but recieved what would be considered a \"half rack\" anywhere else.  On top of that, she said they were the worst ribs she ever had.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Dukes.  The location isn't idle, kind of off the beaten path, but upside... easy parking.  The atmosphere is great... exactly what you want out of a sports bar.  Lots of seating, lots of tv's, lots of pool tables... easy to get a beer.  I would recommend it for anyone looking to watch a game or have a beer at a chill spot."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years! Food is not the greatest, but the wait staff is awesome and really take care of you.  Pool tables, darts, and air hockey keep you entertained while you enjoy drinks from the bar.  Trivia seems like lots of fun, but for me, I frequent Dukes for the karaoke on Saturdays. The good Dj's allow for lots of fun all night long.  There is lots for the sports bar lover to enjoy here!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's right down the street from our house, & we come here almost every weekend. It might not be the nicest looking place, but the food is awesome & the waitstaff is great. Their prices are also great, & I love that they have pool tables. Yes, the interior could use some updating, but I think the datedness adds to the charm.  If you're looking to uppity snooty Scottsdale, this isn't the place for you... But if you're looking for laid back people, good food, & good prices, this is the place."}
{"text":"Hello my fellow yelpers, please take the time to read this yelp because I'm going to expose the truth about the establishment..

I used to be a employee here at this establishment and I regret it. The food was terrible, the staff was rude and disrespectful(except a few) and the owner.. Don't get me started on how much of an a hole he was. 

Now I'll start with the food, working at this establishment, the food took forever to cook.. I would ring in a simple salad and not get it for 20-30 mins.. Now it doesn't take that long to make a salad, the coordination and the communication was terrible.. As a server we would always have a pager on us when the food was done, and there were time food would sit in the window for a long period of time.. Because the cooks wouldn't page us.. Now that being said.. I would ask the cooks to remake my food.. But I guess reheating it in the microwave counts as a \"remake\". Now Dukes signature dish I would say would have to be the wings.. Now, I've eaten alot of chicken wings and this place they're disgusting.. All they do is deep fry them and then extremely sauce them and give them to the customer.. You can say it was more sauce than wings.. Which would incline to a terrible stomach ache the next day.. Another this is alot of the apps were already pre-made.. Other than the mozzarella sticks, everything else was store bought.. The hummus, the cheese, onions rings.. Everything. Do don't be fooled when they say it's all homemade.. Pfft yea, and pigs fly. Also don't go on a busy day either and order food because as I said ealier, you'll wait up to an hour just for your appetizer..


Now for the staff, 
Let's start with the bartenders.. 

MEGAN- very welcoming, very nice and has a great personality.. If it wasn't for her I would of never stayed because she had a heart and that's what defines her. 

MONICA- She was ok, I would ask her something and she would give me a straight answer.. Now when I requested a drink from her.. Yea it took awhile to get my drinks..but she's eh ok. 

Monique- was there to work and Always gossip about everyone . I hated that about her.. She was always gossiping like a 12 year girl alway talking about someone If it was either a customer or even An employee..like it was some kind of reality TV show. I always came into work thinking it was high school again because I felt bullied. 

Mark- oh mark.. This man was in a \"management\" position and was terrible at it.. He would always flirt with the girls, giving them free shots and would rather Stare at a pair of boobs than help his fellow Co workers out.. He was always an a hole to the other workers (other than the girls). As an example, I would ask him for a drink.. His response..no. Or yea hold on.. Then he'll \"playfully\" laugh and say, just kidding.. Like no you weren't.. I heard him talk rude to customers, I heard him make comments that were disrespectful.  So if you go to Dukes and see mark working.. I advise.. LEAVE! just turn around and leave 

Now finally Rebecca (crow) she's like Megan, she was nice and very informative.. She always had answer to my questions..so I don't have any thing to say about her.. 

Now finally the wait staff.  
Just a heads up, you walk in there, the majority of the waitstaff are either high, or extremly rude.. There are a couple female staff are just there to work.. Rude to thier tables and rude to their fellow employees.. Like honestly if you see an ad for this place.. DO NOT APPLY!!!!! Unless your a total B*tch or a stoner.. Because that's all what Al seems to hire.

Now to the owner-
AL. Word of advice.. DO NOT GO TO THIS BAR WHEN THIS MAN IS THERE!!!! And you'll know it's him because he's either yelling at someone or the only drunk ass old man there at the bar. This man has terrible.. Terrible.. Terrible managing experience.. You get hired the first thing he says is.. Your my family and I treat you like family.. HA LIES. I've seen this man grabbed and PULLED one of the servers hand and yell at her because there was a napkin on the floor.. This man only has three computer systems and  he's yelled at people for not using the one in the area. He's yelled at people for not having drinks on the table when they just sat down..hes very judgemental...towards other people.. You walk into the bar wearing cowboy stuff prepared to be yelled At to leave.. Or even shoved out. Because this man will lay his hands on you, if he doesn't like you, he's even layed his hands on the waitstaff thinking it's ok to shove your finger into someone chest or to grab some girls arm and pull her away to yell at her because there is a napkin on the floor.. One of these days he's going to do that to the wrong person and he's going to lose that bar.."}
{"text":"Although we've been here many times in the past (and enjoyed the experience), I was very disappointed to see the menu recently has been streamlined.  The server told us that someone new is now running the kitchen, and has simplified the menu to focus on quality.  Not impressed.  The hamburger that I order came on a kaiser roll that tasted as though it had been pulled out of a bag of rolls.  The \"pound\" of wings that my son ordered cost us $11...can find less expensive and better wings at BWW, Zipp's or even Barro's Pizza.  Very disappointed with these changes in food quality and pricing.  To add insult to injury, we were there today on  NFL opening weekend.  The place was packed, which added to a wait time of over 30 minutes for pretty mediocre food."}
{"text":"Accidentally stopped in on my way to the mountains. .what a wonderfully fun accident it was!..I enjoyed great food,people,laughter, and fun...I played darts,pool...and absolutely enjoyed the atmosphere here...I will make it a planned dinner and fun place to hang in the future..fabulous!"}
{"text":"Well Condor and The Duke go way back, but Sunday was the first time I went for \"Brunch\".  After vigorously exercising along the Scottsdale greenbelt with Scraps, the Wonder Dog (\"SWD\"), for over 10 minutes, we ascended to the patio at Dukes. While I recovered from the workout, Angie, the pet friendly waitress, attended to SWD with ice cold agua fria. The Breakfast Burrito with chorizo was the next undertaking and it was muy bueno. Although no sports were on that early (well the Indy 500 was on, but that is just driving and I can do that locally), the Patio at Dukes was the perfect place for an early morning for a Man and his  Dog."}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill,  is it pretty much a dive bar now w/ prices to match the Scottsdale club scene w/ service nearly nonexistent, do yourself a favor stay far away from this s*!t hole"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot about 8 years ago. I loved all the staff and the food so I figured it wasn't going to be much different and was excited to be back. However my server Paula wasn't very attentive and didn't seem to care. I am a server and a bartender and have been for 10 years so I know the industry very well. She didn't seem happy and I had to get her attention to call her over numerous times, she never asked how our food was; which we didn't like (we got the chicken fingers). I asked for 2 things of blue cheese and 1 more ranch for the chicken before we tried it, they cost .75 each mind you; we tried the chicken and didnt like it so we asked for something else which she got for us but still charged us for the dipping sauce we didn't even use. I think she should have taken them off my bill since they never got used, but I guess she needed the money. I left her a 15% tip when I shouldn't have left anything, the service wasn't good and the food wasn't good. If I ever do come back I'll just sit at the bar and make sure I eat before I come."}
{"text":"Just there for game 7 of World Series, an historic event either way, yet they have no volume or low volume for the game.  They have some trivia guy yelling at full volume but are unable to get game volume.  They also had rodeo and other bs on tvs not realizing the importance of this game.  I gave up a long time ago but gave a second chance tonight.    Won't be back for anything important.   I could imagine what they would do for a Super Bowl. ...  Loud Kareooke? ????

Not a Sports Bar.  See elsewhere."}
{"text":"As a sports bar with a SB menu it a good set up if you like this kind of fare. Unfortunately they only serve conventional brand beers instead of local and or regional mircro beers. So if you like the corporate brand beer and basic sports bar food you'll be fine. Staff is cool and they offer a ride home service if you need it.

The owner \"Duke\" pops in for a few and will talk to customers.  I stopped in only because it was in walking distance from 3 palms hotel i was staying at."}
{"text":"This is what you call a real sports bar. TVs are lining the place with every sport showing on tv. There's a wide range of seating inside and on the outside patio. There's darts, pool, shuffle board, arcade games, and probably more. Friendly staff and good service. The food is your average bar food with reasonable prices. It's a great place to unwind and catch a game. Bonus... They have a giant sign above the bar that reads \"Cowboys Suck\"."}
{"text":"I feel like such an idiot - we tried this place when we first moved here, walked in, then walked right out.
7 months later, we say \"hey, let's try this place Dukes ! Never been there \"

I groaned to my self when we walked in \"you IDIOT\". This place still sucks. 

OK , we wanted to see game 3 of the Heat-Thunder finals, and guess what the audio was in the bar ? A frikking GOLF tournament ! Can you say LAME ? 

So we walked in and politely asked these 2 scummy 20-somethings if someone was sitting on the table between them and the big screen showing the bball game (which also overlooked the temporary kiddie play area with about 8  6 year olds having a birthday party - egad) 

One of them said \"yea, they're free, if you don't block my view\". I glared at him with my best  \"as if...\" look (he was puny). So we sat down, I looked at the kids, then my wife, and we both said 'let's go back to Majerles\", so we left. 

I just don't like the layout of the place, it's got awkward and uncomfortable seating, and the absolutely worst thing about this dump ? 

Kids-in-the-bar. Yes, there are kids in the big section off to the right.  I don't go to a bar that allows kids (Zipps in N. Scottsdale does and they're off my list, too)

Anyway, there are TONS of better bars around town and I dunno, the place just gives me the hibbidy-jibbidys for some reason..."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar. Wonderful staff and decent food. My faves are chicken cordon blue sandwich and western burger. Good soups and nice salad selection. Avoid the onion soup - no onions and cold cheese on top.  Overall though a great place and nice food!"}
{"text":"Great drinks. Terrible food. About what you expect in a sports bar. It's got a nice view being on the green belt."}
{"text":"Been going to the bar and grill for 6 yrs I will never return to this place again. Today my wife and I with our lab sat on the patio had a drink and ate lunch. I got up went to the men's room came back to my table paid the bill left a tip as usual . I stood up to leave when the owner got in my face screaming at me !! He was holding a beer and you can tell he had to much to drink. He was yelling at me at the top of his lungs to get the hell out of his place and never come back. I had my side arm on my hip. Been going there with it on my hip for the last 4 yrs never had a problem . I always look for signs that say no firearms allowed . I have never seen one posted anywhere. He stood there inches from my face yelling at me. Great way to treat your customers . Screaming I don't want packers here!!!!! So I guess I'm a packer fine I am using my constructional rights. I told him if this is his he treats his clients that I'd never return. He said fine I won't let your kind in here. Then proceeded to yell get the fuck out of here!!! I turned and said don't worry I'm not ever coming back to this place. Then yelled what are you going to do ?? You wanna pull in me. I said are you fucking nuts!!! He kept screaming as I walked away.  Sad he could not had been civilized and walked up to me and said sir I guess you did not know we don't allow guns in here. Please do not bring it again. But no he had to be abusive and very mean. This is precisely the type of person I try to stay away from. Reason being they are unstable and you just don't know what they will do .  When he asked me to pull on him this told me just how disturbed this man is. He should be ashamed of himself. I wear the gun to protect myself and other people from crazy nuts like him. I respect the law and abide by the law ."}
{"text":"Good ribs and bar food. Great staff! Leave a little extra time if you are pressed for time at lunch though"}
{"text":"this place pretty much fits the bill for what you expect.  beers.  lots of pitchers.  they even have some device that i haven't seen before to actually keep your pitcher cool while you're drinking away.  club sandwiches, burgers, fries and lots of televisions with just about every possible sporting event showing within your view.  i wouldn't say it's incredibly impressive or the clientele is going to make your jaw drop so you don't necessarily need to drive all over town to get here. but if you're in the neighborhood and need to quench your thirst with a basic selection of beers and kill that pang of hunger with serviceable food while watching the game on solid, average-sized screens then this place will suffice.  this place values consistency over being stellar and i guess there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"Greatest sports bar in PHX and maybe the world.  COWBOYS SUCK is written above the bar.  TVs everywhere, tolerable food, and a great make it yourself Bloody Mary bar on the weekends.  Dog friendly, cool staff. Awesome park right there also."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place but...how in the hell do you charge for coke refills...$1.....seriously? You can't possibly need the money that badly! I'd give it no stars just for that reason alone. And this is coming from someone who has owned 15 restaurants at one time. So, I know the drill and rarely complain about restaurants."}
{"text":"Literally, was here for 2 hours before everyone at the table got their food. Server was rude, manager was rude. The manager Marcia literally said \"I can do a cart wheel and the splits\". I felt mocked, I came here for awesome bar trivia with Darrell, but unfortunately I won't be back. Hopefully the manager and the serving staff gets their act together."}
{"text":"I have to let the public know the Salmon at Dukes is amazing, you will thoroughly be satisfied !!!! Never dry, over cooked, &  litely seasoned to perfection, the digestion and flavor is certainly hard to distinguish from the wild salmon where I lived in Northern British Columbia, Canada!!!!!  Seafood Salmon LOVERS  THIS IS A FOOD THAT YOU WILL CRAVE !!! Ummm try it I've never been disappointed ! 
Thank you Dukes I had a relatively quiet .....relaxing dinnerawesome conversation with Scottsdale City Employee,  a disc golf tournament player, &  great staff !!! ..I  look forward to  nites as this !  Thanks"}
{"text":"Bottom line:   the food is nasty.

My wife ordered something and then went to the rest room.   With in the 2-3 minutes she was gone the food was waiting for her.    It was terrible.    I can see this being a decent place for beers and a game but do not eat there."}
{"text":"Dukes is a solid sports bar with a low key vibe and friendly staff. My only complaint is as a DD; they not only charge $4 for a soda but $1 a refill. Most bars don't charge for soda, especially for DDs."}
{"text":"Great place good food and fast service! I would like to say my wife got harassed by one of the gym trainers from across the street while she was waiting in her car in your parking lot, we no longer feel like we can go here safely without being approached and questioned by a bodybuilder from pt by joes when I just wanted a burger."}
{"text":"Always fun and the food is great! Family used to come here all the time, especially for trivia nights lol."}
{"text":"The bartenders are the only reason I listed this as a two star, I've had several issues with Dukes and honestly I've given too many second chances. Monica is the best bartender in the valley and is totally worth it a visit. The food not so much and the waitresses are garbage, they cuss customers out and ask for Id's just for water and the manager laughs in people's faces."}
{"text":"First I must say Todd is great! However the nachos are weird. I expected real cheese and it's covered in nacho cheese. No mention of this fact on the menu otherwise would not have ordered. I used to get REAL nachos here all the time. I think you should warn a person if they are about to order nacho cheese. Just sayin! Guacamole was good though, no surprises there."}
{"text":"We had a great time playing trivia. The man running the trivia show was really sweet. I wish they had the trivia question on the TV screen. That was the only thing that I would say. It was a lot of fun going to a bar and having entertainment for two or three hours. Much more interesting and fun then  just sitting there drinking"}
{"text":"Stopped by Duke's this morning after finding positive reviews on Yelp. The food was decent enough, but I was ignored by the waitstaff after I was given my food. It took over half an hour AFTER I was finished eating to flag someone down to get my check. It would be one thing if the place was super busy, but there were only two other customers in the entire building. Definitely not worth it, and I would probably only go back if I was in a group."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would. I just moved here from another state and decided to try Duke's for dinner. Instead of having dinner, my night was ruined. As we sat down the waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. Everyone at the table ordered water. She then asked for ID because \"you have to be 21 to be in here\". She did not say \"21 or with an adult or guardian\". She wouldn't serve us or even discuss what our situation was without sending a manager over. I am 25 and legal guardian of my 16 year old sister who was with us (she was the only under aged person). sitting next to us are two adults with their young child. The manager, Mark, was 10x worse than the waitress. He was a smart ass and after hearing our issue, he laughed and said \"why do you come here then\". This place is absolutely awful. Never in my life have I been treated this way at ANY customer service based place of business. Disrespectful, out of line, judgmental and rude don't even begin to touch on the service we got here."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant/bar!  I usually go with my boyfriend but sometimes we bring our kids AND our DOG!  When there is no kids with us, we sit inside and watch sports with TV's everywhere!  If kids are with us, we can enjoy playing some of the games that are separated from the bar (darts, pool, shuffle board, etc.).  And we especially love going with our dog on the patio.  They bring water bowls and treats out for them and there is usually other people with their pets as well.

The food is really good!  I love the Ruben and their Jamaican Salad but honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like.  Plenty of beers on tap.  Prices are good. Restaurant is always busy and laid out nicely.

And finally, if you've had too much to drink, they have a free cab service right outside the bar.  You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch games and drink. Lots of tvs and I'd say the food is on the better side for a sports bar.  They have phone chargers and the service is usually timely.  If in the area I would check it out."}
{"text":"Dukes is hands down my favorite dive bar in Scottsdale. I have had some major life events take place at Dukes, including a boyfriend dropping the \"L bomb\" for the first time. How romantic, right?! 

Anyway, I always have a good time at Dukes. They have about a million TVs, pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, Buck Hunter etc... Definitely a little something for everyone! I find their drinks very reasonably priced - it seems like they always have specials on beers and shots. 

The food is pretty decent for bar food. I'm a big fan of the buffalo style wings, they're nice and big and juicy. Nom nom nom! 

Dukes also provides a free cab service if you happen to indulge in too many spirits. Don't drink and drive, y'all!

My only complaint is that once or twice I've caught some attitude from a bartender, but that's probably a fluke and service is usually fine for a dive bar."}
{"text":"It is just down the street from me but as far as food goes it is just okay...

The reason the rating is so low is due to the fact that we were there to watch the Finally Four and during the same time they decided to also make it trivia night?!? It seemed that everytime one of the teams would make a break they would also be yelling out another question, totally a distraction. Not a good move for a SPORTS bar."}
{"text":"The night started at Dukes. It was bigger and cleaner than it looks from the outside and offers an impressive range of salad. Yes, I had salad at a dive bar and I do not regret it. I also had beer, and a vodka cran on the house for whatever reason. I must say that I like Dukes. Ok, it will not become my go-to but if I lived close enough, I would be a regular of sorts. 

Small stuff that I really enjoy, is the fact that you can borrow a phone charger (you have to give up credit card for trade) and have it charge your phone while you do whatever you do. Small stuff that I find very cool.

Also they have this cool anti-drink&drive policy where they take you home if you are inebriated. I don;t know the details, but the fact that there is one is very cool. Very very cool 

In the end, it's a like a divey sports bar. And that is OK."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place but its getting more and more expensive and the service in the tables is slacking sometimes. Good game coverage but the prices are steep."}
{"text":"Duke's is my place to grab some lunch when I want to get away from the same old grind of a sandwich. The food is okay and has always been fresh when I have eaten here with co-workers. The hot wings, burgers, sandwiches, and salads are all pretty good!  It is a sports bar so if you are wanting to do an intimate lunch or want to speak without having to raise your voice a bit. This would not be the place for you. If you are a sports junkie than this is the perfect place for you to come and relax and watch various sports on there 15+ televisions and have a cold beer."}
{"text":"They have an all new menu, totally fresh! No more freezer food, and they have Orange Shandy on tap! I'm in heaven!!!"}
{"text":"typical bar food,  not fantastic but edible.  probably frozen then cooked at order.  great patio overlooking green belt.  Ashley and I stopped there on bike ride to lake by ASU.  Played frisbee  in green belt below patio after brunch.  cool place to stop. lots of televisions inside but did not go inside."}
{"text":"I will try to be constructive with my critique of this place.   The food was average.   I did not care for the zucchini.  The Philly Cheese Steak did not have much flavor.  Everything tasted like frozen microwave food.   Furthremore, the service was not very good.   Our server was very forgetful and non-attentive to us.   I have no reason to ever come to this place again.   I will not provide a recommendation for this place."}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss. Just like the food. 8 out of 10 times the burgers are excellent but then they lack consistency. A few times they've screwed up the order and sometimes it's overcooked. They could offer onion rings as a side with burgers instead of a $10 appetizer. That would be nice. When it's busy this place seems to fall apart badly. They really have some servers who try and do their best but you can tell management and leadership is lacking. The owner is often here drinking but I've yet to see him lift a finger to help service expediting food or getting drinks for people when the bar and wait staff is clearly buried."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any sports game.  They have TV surrounding the place, it gets loud when a big games are on.  But great food and drink specials.  Try to get there early, sometimes you can't find a parking spots if you go late."}
{"text":"The wait staff is amazing and the food is good, but God forbid you're in here when the owner is getting drunk. He runs people out  a lot if they get in disagreements..."}
{"text":"Good deals on certain days for food. Large selection of sports to watch on the various tvs. The patio setup is great in the fall/winter but brutal during the summer months. The service staff is attentive and take orders as soon as you sit, but I wish the menu had more variety."}
{"text":"Duke's doesn't have the best food or beer in town, but the patio is dog friendly which is neat!  I have brought my Boston Terrier - BUDDY here a few times and we both like it!  The clientelle at this bar is very \"old school\" and mostly \"older\".  The nachos are really good and the CHILI CHEESE FRIES are quite good also.  They have kilt lifter on tap and a pretty good selection of other beers.   It's fun to look out onto Vista Del Camino Park at the passers by as you nibble on your food and sip your ice cold beer!!  Everytime I see Duke's I think of Fraiser's Dad from that TV show and he the name of HIS bar was also \"Duke's\""}
{"text":"Lame.....................

So I was looking for a good dive bar near my house. I am not talking Apache Rd in Tempe divey, where the patrons could possibly stab you, but a good low key hang out. I need a Cheers.

When I read the Michael C.'s great review that said they have free car service to pick you up and drop you off I thought I had found my place!

OH how I hate being wrong!  I went here with a friend Saturday night, after waiting 30 minutes for the car to pick us up, the driver told us he had no change so we could tip him. So we ended up giving him in a tip what a cab would have cost us. It was obvious he was scamming us, but what is the point of confronting him? I needed him to take me home later.

Now this one won't be a negative for the guys, but there were way more chicks than guys. I prefer a few more guys in a bar.  But I guess the biggest missing element for me was fun people to talk to. I love going to a bar with a friend, having a few drinks, and meeting fun people to talk to. Those people weren't here. It was a weird crowd, and not in a good way. One weird solo guy at nearby table was actually leaning in and listening in on our conversation, then he would make comments out loud, but to himself, about what we said. His back was to us the whole time. The whole thing was a little One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The music and the karaoke were entertaining, but I prefer a bar that has interesting people who you want to meet.

The waitress was almost completely devoid of personality. The little that was there obviously hated being at Dukes! She sucked, and she screwed up our bill.

One lady who worked there named Cynthia stopped by for a minute, and she was cool and friendly. Thanks for the 5 minutes of friendliness Cynthia!

Another negative was the brightness of the bar. Hello, bars should not be that bright. You needs just the right combo of alcohol and dim lighting to meet your future ex-boyfriend.

Just an overall disappointment! Unfortunately, I won't be back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Server was awful. I asked for wine and the server said they didn't have any . I looked at the table across and two people had wine. He didn't know the beers- we knew more than him. He took our order and brought out our food, but left without leaving us silverware or condiments. My salad was watery and tasted terrible . We had to ask other servers for things we needed. The waiter also took my drink before I was finished . Overall horrible, horrible service ."}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the spicy burger (it had some clever name but I don't remember what it was) and a local draft beer. The burger was phenomenal. The service was really great the bartender Monica was really gracious. 

They have Karaoke if you are into that kind of thing"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, service is a bit spotty, but otherwise good.

No doubt its a huge place with a ton of TVs and good food, great place for sports fans! Cowboys fans beware!!!

Stop in and cheer for favorite team."}
{"text":"The service was responsive and friendly.  I love watching sporting events here. This is my number 1 place to go for watching games. Friendly and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ok. I had two five dollar gift cards and decided to try some food and a beer. I still refused to order any of their thirty salads, but I did try the $8.45 grilled buffalo chicken wrap and it was better than expected, but still three star material. The buffalo sauce had a good kick and the chicken was grilled strips - it was all stuffed into a tortilla with grilled onions and a few peppers and lettuce. They forgot my side of dressing and the fries were standard frozen, but crisp and the slaw was good, but not homemade. They serve late, so if your in need, try the wrap, you will be filled up. Couple bucks less and it might have been a value deal."}
{"text":"Rude waitresses. Bad service. Microwave tasting food. Seems like it would be fun if the food didn't taste like garbage and the help was pleseant. It smelIs bad inside, kind of like vomit. I love dive bars but this place has taken it too far. I will never ever go to this place again and I would not send my worst enemy there. May God have mercy on Duke's soul."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar, in dire need of some redecorating! This place looks (and smells) like 1974, nix the HD tv's. Its an OK place to meet a pal for a beer, but no dates, or it'll be your last date with that Gal!"}
{"text":"So, stopped in for lunch today. First time, and the last time.  Sat at the bar, service was good.  $3 for ice tea, my brother also ordered an ice tea. Another $3. 

I asked for a refill, Jackie States $1 refill. For damn ice tea.

Tell you what, the minimum wage law kills business, but for lunch, $31 dollars later (chicken strips and a club sandwich) I'll frequent other places in the area.

$7 for tea. Unreal."}
{"text":"Good ol' Duke's! This place is a standard for us. We go there often and LOVE trivia with Darel! Service is hit or miss. Some times we have great service, other times it is dismal. Prices are decent and it is a fun atmosphere. It is a good local spot with staff you will recognize. BTW, this is where I had my first date with my man, so that gives it four stars!"}
{"text":"Great place to go play pool! They have nice tables, shuffleboard, and TV's. The service is great. The food is pretty good for bar food. The nachos are on point! They have a nice patio outside. If you are into frisbee golf there is a great course right next door. You can stop in for a beer halfway through the game if you want. They have good happy hours. The best part is they give you a free ride home if you had a couple too many! They do pool tournaments from time to time and they are always doing specials on the weekends."}
{"text":"I don't know why I kept going back to this place. First of all if you go there you will probably get bad service. They have two people that work their that are good, the rest of the staff is horrible. They are remodeling the place, they need much more than a remodel.  The owner needs to take responsibility of his establishment and not let his staff run his restaurant. Remodeling isn't going to improve sales it's the staff.  Have I mentioned how bad the staff is there. Could be a great place but no one cares there. Don't bother going to this place. I would love to see it go under and have some new take it over that actually cares. Go to pranksters, much better service."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for Super Bowl. Seating was OK and some TVs didn't have best clarity. People were there to watch the Super Bowl, yet they didn't have all the TVs tuned in for it. We asked, since the ones over the bar had every other TV on another station and it was distracting. Waitress said they are a sports bar so they needed to play any other sports on TV. Watching a story about Allen Iverson or Curling was not worth even having on, but they wouldn't change the stations.  Ordered Chili Cheese Fries that come with cheese and onions. Our server asked if we wanted cheese and onions?!?  So what are chili cheese fries without the cheese? They came, cold and without onions.  I ordered ice tea and found out that refills cost money. Who does that?? Asked for dessert menu and was told they don't serve any desserts because their kitchen is too small. The owner, I presume, had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert because we don't drink?  People who drink, eat desserts. Not a place I will go back too. Wasn't impressed, at all."}
{"text":"Regular sports bar with a couple of unique amenities.  Large patio on the Scottsdale greenbelt.  Menu where every sandwhich has a corresponding salad version (essentially replace the bread with lettuce).  Lots of specials, and a fun birthday offer.  It's quite large with multiple sections, and televisions all around."}
{"text":"The menu of salads is expansive!! And on Wednesday nights they have a special on the salads for I believe around $6.50. They also have sandwiches, drinks and an outdoor patio. I was really impressed with the salad I had.. I know salads are hard to get wrong but it was a big heaping portion of greens with yummo fried chicken atop and a bonus that I happened to go on a Wednesday night for the special. (: 

I know this place is popular, they stay open until about 12A every night and serve food very late. Millions of TV's, seating and a chill atmosphere.

I haven't had a drink there but am definitely thinking about it next time before I hit up Old Town Scottsdale since I live nearby."}
{"text":"So sad to write this but it needs to be fixed ASAP! Please have a manager !!!

Past few times horrible service . We won't see our server for a very long time and won't get drinks unless we start another tab at the bar .

Honestly -anyone - just stick with sitting at the bar . It's very hard to track out anyone for a meal,drink or bill.  ( and it's not that busy )

Sad .not sure if we will be back for awhile ."}
{"text":"This place is great! We needed a late night dinner and the menu was impressive for being 10pm on a weeknight. The food was really good and it wasn't just standard bar food. My buffalo chicken sandwich was huge! A very generous sized chicken breast with lots of fixings. I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Outdoor patio where my dog hung out while we watched football, great drink prices, yummy sandwiches and we really loved the wings! We are visiting from out of town and we like it so much we will be back for MNF tonight."}
{"text":"This place has decent coverage of the games. Waited what seemed like for 50 minutes for nachos. Let's get it together."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great for watching football,  service was good and a Bloody Mary bar was a treat.  We had a group of 8 and a nice table to converse.  My beef is with NOT informing us that the 18% gratuity was included.......therefore I tipped another 20%......sb the responsibility of the staff to remind us.....shame on you!!!   I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This sports bar is a real sports bar with a menu that has your awesome bar food with other healthy options. I am gluten free and had the best BBQ bacon cheeseburger that had a gluten free bun! It was so amazing! The staff is friendly and the drinks are always on the ready!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30 on a Wednesday and ordered promptly.  It took 30 minutes for a salad and a french dip (and they weren't very busy).  The fries were cold.  The sandwich was cool.  The au jus was hot enough to burn my lip, thereby rendering the whole thing inedible until it cooled.  The ranch was so runny it was like water.  And, to top it off, got a touch of food poisoning.  Won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"This is your typical sports bar with mediocre fried food options, but it is great for watching the game as they have a plethora of televisions. They could use to clean it up a little bit as it feels a little dirty. However the owner loves to give out free shots when his teams play."}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent service and food. Very comfortably back patio. Gone back several times"}
{"text":"I came in on a Wednesday night for trivia and had a pretty mediocre time. Six of my friends all met to eat, drink, and have a good time, but service kind of ruined it for us. I was sharing pitchers of beer with three other dudes and it was all I could do to get more beer. It took about thirty minutes to flag down the waitress and then get the next one delivered. Half an hour with nothing to drink.
Add to that that our food took a really long time too. Now, it being trivia night i was prepared to cut the kitchen some slack... But our food came out an hour after we ordered it and it was cold. Even great food isn't that good cool cold and this was just standard bar food. 
The trivia on the other hand was a high point. Their announcer is clear and repeats stuff often enough that everyone gets it. The trivia is diverse and interesting and I felt like everyone had a chance to win it. (We got third!) 
Ultimately however, we brought a designated driver because we wanted to drink and we left pretty sober."}
{"text":"I'm slowly becoming a Thursday night regular here. Although I am not 80 years old, I do thoroughly enjoy Bingo night. It gets me to focus, it makes me EXTREMELY competitive (like seriously, I will bust the table over if you sit next to me and win) and well, I love the chance at winning cold hard cash (read: $5).

But Bingo aside, Duke's isn't a bad place to roll into. They have a pimpin' ride right outside the bar that will take you home (fo' free) if you get too drunk and cannot drive yourself home. This is becoming quite the trend for sports bars in the valley and although I don't know how often they get used, I still thoroughly applaud and support this trend to prevent drunk drivers out there.

Alright that's enough of my sob stories. Lets talk about the food. Thursday night has rack-of-rib special for $8 which is a great deal. If you are a healthy eater like me, the menu has like 20 salad options. HOWEVER, note that the salad options kinda go like this \"caesar salad, chicken caesar salad, prime rib caesar salad, salmon caesar salad, cobb salad, chicken cobb salad, prime rib cobb salad, ....\". So, they're not particularly delicious, but if you get prime rib on a salad for the same price as just the salad (sans the prime rib), I would call that a decent deal.

For the sports lovers, let me just say that this is as sporty of a sports bar as it gets. There are TVs everywhere and you will hear the bell chime every time there is a TD. My favorite is the giant screen TV in the tiny tiny women's bathroom: so, if you are alone there and are ballsy enough to pee with the stall door open, you can watch your favorite team while making more room for your beer. Creepy? A little. Cool? Very. 

A solid 3 stars for effort and a decent atmosphere. An imaginary +1 for the hot Michigan fans there. Not that i'm partial to them or anything... :)"}
{"text":"We were riding the Scottsdale trail with our granddaughter and stopped at our half way point to eat lunch. It has now been an hour and we are still waiting for our food. I understand that the Montana Football game is their busiest day, but seriously. Plan ahead and work at full staff. This bar is huge inside and I'm sure it's packed. We opted to eat in the patio and every table is full. Good thing we packed some string cheese. Very disappointed in the service. We were here 2 weeks ago on Sunday after riding and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. May rethink this spot. Portillos sounds really good right now!!"}
{"text":"The staff was personable and attentive, even when the Steelers lost AFC Championship :( Bartender has a good pour and drink prices seemed little less than base price of \"call liquor\" in Scottsdale. 
The food I did sample was just good enough, not great.
All in all though super chill, where nice people wait on nice people who come together for fun, food and drink!"}
{"text":"I like going to dukes! I think it's a really fun environment and has good bloody Mary's which are hard to find in Phoenix. 
I've been there maybe 10 times and only once did we get decent service. If it's busy when you get there, expect to ask for your server, as they won't notice you for 30 minutes or more. Once, we had a group of 6, and the waitress finally came by and brought us fries. When we had eaten half the fries and she returned, she said \"who ordered these?\" We had all assumed one of us did or she brought them over as an apology for the wait. Wrong! She grabbed them and scolded us for eating another table's fries. The one time we received our food within a normal time frame and had a polite server, made a world of a difference. This won't prevent me from returning for a game and a bloody, but Id go there more if the service improved."}
{"text":"Dukes more like Pukes. 
Positives-
AVG food and Descent service
Negatives-
This place is dirty the chairs were dirty and the glasses and cups were old and dingy. My friend was given and Ice holder that keeps the beer in the pitcher cold and it was broken and looked old and NASTY.
Also a weird crowd with very little scenery, if ya know what I mean. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night for trivia and the place was packed.  They have a lot of pool tables, shuffle board and a million TVs.  Everything you could ever want in a sports bar, right?  Well here is what you don't want. It is SO loud in there you can barely have a conversation.  Our server was missing most of the night and when he did show up he screwed up our orders.  

I give it three stars, 1 for the wall of TVs showing different games, 1 for the menu that has a lot of variety including 2 pages of salads, and finally 1 star for the fact that they have a bloody mary bar.  This alone will get me back in there to watch football on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but!! It took an hour and 45 min to get our food. The one star is for the amazing service our waitress gave us. I felt bad for her that the kitchen was so slow!! Thanks Megan."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hang out places. If you want good beer, good company, and great service this is your place. Super friendly staff, has great wings and tater tots as well as shuffle board. Great atmosphere to be in for a chill Friday night"}
{"text":"I am not usually the \"sports bar\" type, so the first time I went to Duke's, it was because of a friend's recommendation for the food.  The daily specials are quite a steal and since we went on a Saturday, getting a decent ribeye for less than $9.00 seemed like the way to go.  We enjoyed the meal, had the patio to ourselves and it was a lovely day.  When we cashed out, the server gave us a birthday postcard to fill out, so we did.  Last week, my fiance received his, so we decided on going Saturday so he could have the ribeye.  This time, we sat inside because it was a bit cool outside.  A bit loud and way too much basketball, but hey it's a sports bar, right?  Again, the food was good, especially considering their really low prices.  My guys vodka tonic wasn't up to par, but all in all, we enjoyed the experience and will go again next month for my free birthday meal."}
{"text":"The food is better than typical bar fare - my husband and I both enjoyed the food - but I cannot recommend this place because we had such a bad experience here. 

This was our first visit to Duke's on McDowell Road, which is pretty close to our home. Great location for a sports bar and a cool place to watch sports on a hot summer day in Scottsdale. 

We went to Duke's to watch Game 7 of the NHL Western Conference playoffs, and the owner refused to put it on in the main part of the bar, despite multiple customers' requests.

He told hockey fans to go to the pool (billiards) room to watch the game. No one went.

As we were leaving, my husband told the owner that we would have stayed longer if we could have heard the game. \"What do you want to hear, the puck going into the net?\" he says, laughing at us. And he tells us, \"See ya later,\" telling us if we don't like it we can leave. Who does that??

We weren't asking him to turn off the Dodgers game. We wanted him to turn off the sound for baseball and turn ON the sound for hockey.  

We'll never go back to Duke's. Scottsdale has many other, better choices."}
{"text":"Trust me, I have all sorts of love for dive bars. But this one is just not on my list. We used to play trivia here and that was a good time. Other than that it is an easy place to pull up to on a bike off the green belt."}
{"text":"It's a great local spot, and is exactly what you expect of it. It has a ton of TVs, good bar food, and great prices. I suggest this for a laid back night, or to watch a game. They'll accommodate most requests on one of their many TVs."}
{"text":"Great service! Fish tacos are fantastic.  My son had wings and loved them.  Great bloody marys, nice portions, not too big or too small.  Very reasonably priced.  Near the green belt so eat, drink, walk..;)"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun, attentive staff, cheap (or free) pool. Reasonably prices drinks!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Great service, good prices.  It's a nice sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Down in Scottsdale on business, this was the after meeting place.  Great ribs, shrimp, salmon, and sliders.  If the carried Bud light on tap, I would give them 6 stars."}
{"text":"Wings were solid, big and cooked well.  Chili was decent with lots of cheese.  Southwest burger was cooked nicely, mayo on the bun was a mistake.  Tater Tots were crispy.  Beer menu could have used some more craft beer but I'm splitting hairs here.  Good joint, will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar! Here once a week if not more. My parents love when they visit from Cali and come on trivia nights. My pup loves the patio as well."}
{"text":"service is hit or miss but amazing sports bar.  No DUI taxi and the owner is big cards fan."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the food
However, I do appreciate that they have a LOT of salads on the menu!
Yay!

This is a good neighborhood bar.  If you're looking for trivia, karaoke, cheap happy hour drinks and you live in the neighborhood.... GO!

If you don't live in the neighborhood, don't bother."}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised when we had lunch here last Thursday. The bartender was super friendly and attentive and our food was delicious! Very good experience!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff! Great tap list and inviting environment. Had the Hess ipa solid local beer. The fish and chips were great highly recommended. Rebecca and Jackie were the best! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My friend just moved in to the apartments next door and got a $25 gift card so we decided to check it out. I was more than pleased with the atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Wednesday and Friday are trivia nights and I will definitely be returning to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great spot, friendly staff, good food and drinks with a ton of TVs, pool tables, darts, fooze, buck hunter etc.  Reasonable prices and open floor plan.  Great friendly atmosphere and like the other reviews report its not a \"Scottsdale scene\", this is where you and your friends go for a beer, to watch a game, shoot some pool (or fireball shots..maybe both), or stop in midway through a disc golf game.  Patio is dog friendly so weekends its a great place to walk and enjoy a beer with other dog lovers.  This is a great spot for a casual night with friends, trivia on wed and Fridays is better then most places trivia (actually challenging general knowledge not just filled with crap pop culture questions, its actually good for all ages). One of the few true sports bars on the east side of town.  The owner AL is there most times and takes great pride in his bar and sponsors allot of local teams and charity events!  

Food Review (Updated 1/22/16): Well when I had written the original review they had just redone the whole menu and everything was fresh way above expectations for a while.  Although I still go there all the time and love this place I felt I need to update the food part as it was not accurate any more.  The food is still way better but has slipped back to above average bar food, and in the Scottsdale market with gastro pubs and sports bars everywhere if your just going for a great food experience there are allot of choices specialize in food. If you want a great neighborhood sports bar with good food and tons of TVs this is your place.  Quesadilla, Egg McDuke Burger, Chicken Tenders, are still my favorites.

FAMILY?: During normal lunch and dinner hours it is fine for a family but if you take your kids to watch a football game at a bar on Sundays maybe you should read some more parenting books and not be mad that its a BAR environment (a few of other reviews complain about not kid friendly during football, personally i hope they don't come back as they really mess up my football experience giving me dirty looks when I curse the Damn Packers... its a sports bar people).     

FOOTBALL:  DA BEARS!!!!
Unlike zips and other venues in Scottsdale you can actually watch all the games at once there is a wall of tvs not just scattered tvs.  Get there at least 30 min before your game on Sundays as it fills up and you need to snag a table or grab one from people leaving from prior game.  It is a go to football spot for most people in a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"Who is warming up to Dukes? This guy!

Been in more frequent and I must say the place is looking great. Updates to TVs to start and the staff is on point. Great/ quick/friendly service all make me rethink why I haven't been hanging out here more often.

I really like the food, everything has been great in the last few months, but my favorite dish is the shrimp platter."}
{"text":"If you like subpar bar food and service that takes forever, come to Duke's.

The one redeeming quality is the dog friendly patio, it's a pretty large patio as well. Inside there are tons of tvs, pool tables and they even do trivia multiple nights a week. 

When I've eaten here however, I haven't really been that impressed. I've always never chosen this place, my friends did because they live walking distance from it. Duke's a 2.75 Star restaurant to me... not awful but definitely not something worth traveling for."}
{"text":"The menu is a vegetarian's nightmare. You are pretty much stuck with either nachos (does not include beans) or a veggie burger (obvious microwaved boca burger). They do have shuffle board, but you have to pay, and its timed, so make sure you pee prior to dropping in your quarters because you got maybe 15 minutes to bust that game out or your screwed."}
{"text":"We stopped in at this bar on a Friday afternoon after realizing that the gluten free bakery in the same shopping center had closed it's kitchen. We were seated outside on the side patio. We enjoyed our view of groups playing Frisbee golf and people out enjoying the beautiful day. The food was pretty mediocre. We started with the fried zucchini appetizer. I ordered the veggie burger sans bun with fries for my entree and my sigo had the Philly Cheese steak sandwich with Au Jus. My \"burger\" came with a measly piece of lettuce so I asked for extra which I don't believe we were charged for. The food we had was just OK."}
{"text":"Go here if you:
Like to watch sports
Don't like to wear anything fancier than a brand new T-Shirt
Just want to chill out
Hate to dance
Like pool
Like beer

Don't go here if you:
Take 2 hours to get ready to go out
Drink fine wine when you go out
Can't decide whether PCL or Dirty Pretty is your favorite bar
Expect a DJ
Don't like an age diverse crowd

This is an awesome spot to grab a beer and watch the game.  The place is generally full of people that are similar in tastes.  I am not sure if I would classify this one as a dive bar, but it does have somewhat of that feeling.  It is also a lot bigger than it looks from the street.  If you like sports bars and are nearby, it is a must to try it."}
{"text":"I'm not even a big fan of sports and this is easily my favorite bar. The prices are really cheap for a bar and the food is good considering it's just bar food. They have daily specials including a day where you can get a two dollar hamburger with fries. This means its a real hamburger, not a tiny little thing. My mom and I can share it. 

Pool, Shuffleboard and Darts are available as well as other games. Electronic cards and racing. The service is always amazing even if theyre very busy. I've never had a bad waitress here. 

The best part is that they have a giant private room and guess how much it is to rent it out? It's completely free. You just have to book it in advance. They could have easily charged a lot for that private room since it includes its own shuffleboard and pool table. 

Also they have a FREE designated driver who will take you home. All they ask is that you tip them. There's no reason to ever go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar (my cousin loves this place). It's huge with great vibes - everyone is friendly. Their beer selection is a bit lacking (I'd like to see a few options other than the normal Bud, BudLight, and a few \"crafts\"). Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. Other than one cocktail waitress the service has been RIDICULOUS.  Most of the food I have had is pretty gross, wings were ok. The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because they have free pool nights."}
{"text":"They make an awesome prime rib steak salad for 8.75, I love there tuesday special, prime rib steak with fries and salad for like 7 dollar, but you have to order a drink to get the special, so i order a bottle water, still a great deal. The steak is very tender and Duke's only use the best meat, plus they only use non transfat oil to cook all there food. Duke's kind of health councious on how they cook things. But eating a burger is still bad for you, but at less they are trying to keep it more natural."}
{"text":"It's up and it's good!  The best sports bar in town.  Friendly service, fairly priced food, excellent game day atmosphere."}
{"text":"When the bartender says it sucks, then the place must really suck.  A group of us went here on a Wednesday night and we were told that this place was really bumping before.  Two churches close by complained and the original owners picked up a left for a new location.  So whatever you heard in the past probably don't hold up to what it is now.  My co-worker that saw this place in the hey-day was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here after flying into town on business.  The girl at the front desk of our hotel recommended this place.  There was some disc golf event going on so it was very busy.  It took about 45 minutes to get menus and waters after we had already been seated.  We ordered burgers and sandwiches and some beers.  The beers came out pretty quickly.  We waited about an hour for our food.  My French Dip was good and the burgers were good, according to my co-workers.

I cannot give this place more than three stars due to the fact that grabbing a quick bite turned into a two and a half our ordeal."}
{"text":"I've come to Duke's a lot for carryout orders later in the evening, probably 50 plus orders. They are open during hours many places are closed which I love. 

However, while they claim the kitchen closes at midnight, bar at 1AM, the last couple times I've called in they've closed the kitchen well ahead of midnight. This gets frustrating as a frequently returning customer who enjoys their select group of late-night food options.

I will no longer be going to Duke's because of this, sadly. They have some good food options and their attempt to be available later in the evening is wonderful but inconsistent."}
{"text":"I am very convinced that there is no such thing as a sports bar with good service in Scottsdale.  Dukes is no exception.  

I went to Dukes last Sunday for the Chargers game and it was packed.  I was pretty happy to see a sports bar within stumbling distance to my house that was actually a lot bigger than it looks from outside.  Sure, its in a strip mall but I can overlook that.  

What I cant overlook is how downright miserable our server looked when she was actually anywhere near our table, which wasnt often.  I almost deducted two stars for this, since other friends of mine had been there the day before and said their service from another girl was equally as poor.  

What I do like about Dukes:

Cheap drinks
Bloody Mary bar
A billion TVs
Shuffle Board
The layout and big space
Free Wi-Fi (No I did not take my laptop, but for those fantasy football players that must have their scores immediately, it seemed like a good thing)

All in all, a good place to watch the game, whoever youre cheering for.  Maybe service at the bar (instead of at a table) is better."}
{"text":"Cool staff, nice place and some tasty foods.  There are two parts I am having issues with however.  

First they had a free driver service for many years and it says they still have it on a few pages.  Not so and I am upset they did not have the foresight to update things once they changed the service.

Secondly were their ribs.  They tasted great!  There were some disgusting fat nodules though and the bones were oddly cut.  That cut down the enjoyment however for me."}
{"text":"Good sports bar.  It was Thurs and they ran out of the rib special.  Salad was good.! Beers are cold."}
{"text":"Great sports bar.  Plenty of seating, plenty of tvs, and dog friendly patio.  Nice selection on menu with daily specials, they sometimes run out of menu items which isn't cool but there are plenty of other good selections.  Try the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and green chili gravy...yum."}
{"text":"We came in to watch the GRIZ play as the owner is from Montana. This place is dingy, dirty, and has horrible service. I've never been to a bar that charges for refills. Not a fan of this place. Not sure why people come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place as it was very close to my hotel. Had an Ice Cold Beer, and good service at the bar area. In addition as it was Monday night they were doing a special on their basic burger or a pork tenderloin sandwich for $4.00. 
I chose the PTS and it was pretty good, not amazing mind you, but tasty and the price sure was right. It was served with nice crisp and hot fries, and it hit the spot perfectly.
I would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and a cold drink. Plenty of TV's as well for your sports watching needs."}
{"text":"Hidden in a random strip mall, there's a good chance plenty of people pass Dukes without realizing that they are missing out. Now, this is a dive bar so like all other dive bars, you have to take it for what it is. The floors could be shinier, the bathrooms could be cleaner, but then it wouldn't be an authentic dive bar would it?

Duke's is a solid choice when looking for a place to play some bar games, watch sports and enjoy some drinks. It's spacious and great for large groups. You name the game, they've got it: several pool tables, darts, shuffle board, Foosball, etc. TVs line the walls with your favorite sport teams playing. With the reasonably priced drinks, this is a good place to pregame before a sporting event or set up shop and watch it on TV. 

I've hosted a party at Dukes and it's a perfect location because of the size, TVs, games and most importantly, because they don't charge to rent out the party room. So, you can have up to 100 people in a party room without any fees! And, for a girl on a budget trying to throw a low key party, this was a perfect choice. 

So I suggest Dukes if you are looking for a dive bar night on the town and you don't want to just sit around when you get there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Erica is the best!! She makes the best margaritas! Can't go wrong! #teamerica!!!"}
{"text":"Come here after kickball all the time! The food is good and the beer is grand. It's a small hole-in-the-wall but it is fun."}
{"text":"Great place for sports, shooting pool, playing shuffleboard...you name it!  Just had the chicken Oriental Salad and it was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Although I appreciate the new \"fresh menu\" Dukes is trying to convey I think they missed the mark. I ordered a turkey guacamole sandwich and it came with a choice of sides and I got a salad. The salad came out first which was fine then the sandwich came out and it was just a half a sandwich on a plate. My husband ordered the salmon which was a little salmon strip with mushy broccoli I and rice a roni type rice. 
They need tweak the menu more in order for me to go back. The beer wouldn't draw me in. I can go to another sports bar for that."}
{"text":"Oh what's to say about Duke's that hasn't already been said. I've had some really great times here over the years AND there've been some times that I wish my friends would just let me forget already.

Karaoke, build your own bloody mary, $6 pitchers and rock -n- roll nachos are all part of why I never mind coming here.

One word of caution, though, if you're drinking said $6 pitchers, it's probably flat beer and not too fresh. Often times, you can see a server dipping a straw into the pitcher and briskly giving the beer a stir, causing it to \"head\" up a bit before bringing it to your table. But it's piss beer anyway, so you pretty much get what you pay for.

My favorite times coming here are during games in which hometown teams are doing well and the owner gives away free shots. Also, the patio is nice during the winter.

Oh yeah, free car ride home if you're too hammered to drive. So please tip the driver!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food, and overall a good time! Also there is an entire room dedicated to foosball and pool which pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Ended up here on a Saturday night after a long day of solid drinking... and it continued nicely here with some karaoke.  I can't speak to the food here because we didn't order any, but the service was solid and the drinks were nice & cold.  

The karaoke host was great and the selection of songs was vast.  I like that they had a couple of books to look at and choose your songs from - sadly the last few times I went it was just luck of the draw whether they had the song you wanted to sing.

I'll be back, and next time I'll try the food!!"}

I would say this place was my type of bar 10 years ago, but now in my early 30's I need something more up to date.  This place is huge and has a decent patio.  Table to video games in every room.  Nostalgic sports awards to basic sport memorabilia hangs along the ways with advertisement of alcohol.  Large TV screens here and there with random channels playing.  

I just didn't get a good feel about this place.  Drinks seem pretty affordable here, but the food wasn't too impressive.  We ordered the burger with fries, artichoke dips and jalapeño poppers.  I didn't eat the burger, but the fries were stale.  Ever ate fries that were in the freezer too long and the left in frying oil that needed to be changed?  Yeah it tasted like that.  The artichoke dips seemed like it came out of a box.  It didn't have much taste and the only thing I ate was the tortilla chips.  Finally the poppers were probably the \"best\" of the night between the dishes.  Nice and creamy once you bit into it and crispy on the outside.  

Overall, serve was good since we were the only large group of people in there.  If you live close by and need a drink I would recommend this place.  However, the immature crowd and poor karaoke music doesn't make we want to stay too long. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay place on the greenbelt.Food is average at best.Drinks are all about a dollar to two dollars more than you would expect to pay in a place like this.Usually crowded with a lot of regulars.Pleasant atmosphere with a patio.Relatively clean place.I like the shuffleboard.The owners name is Al he likes to get drunk and argue with the customers.He likes to talk politics ,worships the Democrat party but oddly most of customers that discussed politics are very conservative.His daughter Jackie runs the day shift she is nothing like her father, always nice to the customers and knows her stuff.Some of the staff is super friendly like Rebecca and Monica others the exact opposite.The one gal that works there is always shooting me looks like she hates me, don't know why for she only waited on me once,I was not rude to her in any way just asked for a beer and left a tip.Lots of TVs,they will try and put your game on."}
{"text":"Totally sufficient for a few rounds of pool or darts while keeping an eye on the 67 tv screens they have mounted on the walls.

Just stick to the cheap pitchers of domestic beer. I ordered a rum and coke and it tasted like cleaning products. 

I would come back, but only if I didn't feel like driving all the way to Lucky Break in Tempe."}
{"text":"If you want to eat in a barn with a bunch of animals then sit on the Dukes patio. And the waitress pet the Animals and then serve you food. So it's now called Pigsville instead of Dukes! Or if you want to sit outside away from the pigs, you can move to back of patio and inhale all the second hand smoke and die from that. Overall it is a disgusting place. I wouldn't even Piss on the patio let alone eat there and if you want your animal fix just order the food because the waitresses will bring your food after they have petted all the gross animals."}
{"text":"I only had a couple of beers here so I can't judge the food, but the atmosphere is great. It's much larger inside than it appears from the parking lot. The staff is very helpful and courteous and they had tons of TV's. It was a great place to watch sports and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good local spot! No complaints... always decent food and good prices. Waitresses don't know how to play trivia which kinda made it more confusing but still figured it out."}
{"text":"There's something about sports bars in Scottsdale and Phoenix that's always makes me feel like I'm getting nickeled and dimed. I found Dukes to be the best out of that group though.

Dukes reminds me of a Doc & Eddies North. It doesn't feel corporatized like, say,  Gallagers.

Dukes is kinda divey, feels like your large local bar and it did a good job accommodating our groups for college football games.

I even saw a private area reserved for fans watching the University of North Dakota. If your bar can accommodate fans of an FCS  school, I'm impressed. 

TVs are spread throughout the bar, there's a pool table and games and they are consistently open Saturday mornings so you can watch your team's 9:00 am kickoff (unlike some bars).

I haven't been to Dukes in a long while. I once watched a game there when a drunk football fan tried to fight me because I tried to explain to him two teams from the same conference cannot play in the Superbowl. He felt like I was showing up his football intelligence. 

He was there alone and I was with a group. When I told him I wouldn't go into the parking lot with him he went to the bar and stared me down   waiting for me to leave. One of the ladies I was with complained to the staff. He offered her a free drink for her inconvenience. She then explained to him that it wasn't her he wanted to fight.

Okay, so the staff isn't brilliant. It's still a good place to watch football.
Unfortunately I can't comment on the food because I don't remember eating any. I think Tempe and Chandler sports bars are better values when it comes to food. 

I'd go back to Dukes over Upper Deck, Gallagers, Half Moon, Full moon or Blue Moon."}
{"text":"I have been going to duke's with friends for years...past 3 times there not so good twice are food was frozen they would not take it off Bill just bought a drink which was nice but should have been addressed...also sitting at bar last time was like we weren't even there...very disappointing we really like going there"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today. The food was good but the service was horrible. I got a burger with sweet potato fries. The ketchup was fermented to fix the problem. ICK! Good luck trying to get anyone's attention! Obviously won't go back after this experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by after playing kickball at papago park. I wasnt expecting much as I have always considered it solely a bar. Where the particular item I ordered was strange for my taste buds it was good. I had the Jamaican chicken salad with the jerk chicken. I must admit the chicken was cooked perfectly and the flavor was delicious. I also had a bite of my friends' chilli, also tasty. Finally, it also amazed me to know they accept children before 9pm. I know, I know who brings their kid to a bar? In my defense, I learned this eve that they earn the title bar AND Grill for a reason, that reason? A six page menu with plenty to choose from. I am fairly certain we will return before seasons end. Oh, my waitress was awesome and cooperated in bringing my bill right away so I could be sure we got out before 9 :)"}
{"text":"This place was a blast.  The drinks keep flowing and the crowd was amazing. My bartender Monica was super nice and she can sing too!!!  It was Karaoke Thursday... I had so much fun with almost 56 televisions, who wouldn't love this place!!!

I'll be back at Duke's real soon.....real soon!"}
{"text":"I love dukes!! Never had any bad service here, price point is good and I find the atmosphere nice!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Duke's a lot during my 3+ years in Scottsdale. I've drank, eaten, played trivia and had some really good times. The service and the workers are always great and have a smile on their faces.

With that being said, I went to watch Football this weekend and I saw about 5 cockroaches in and around the room I was in - on my table, on the floor and walking on the wall. I was pretty disgusted by it all, but wanted to finish watching the Pats game. I then went to take a sip of water and there was actually a fucking cockroach in my water glass. Thankfully the Pats were up because I couldn't stand to be in there any longer. I went home and showered.

Sad to say it but I will never go back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now and love Monica. 
By far my favorite 'dive bar' with both the perfect amount and variety of bar games. 
The food isn't bad either!"}

{"text":"Wrong Food Twice.  Cold food when brought back.  Poor service.  If you want wrong food but good trivia this is your place"}
{"text":"Is this place closed?  Just went at 3:30 PM on Monday and the doors were locked and nobody was inside."}
{"text":"I come here every time I visit Scottsdale.  It is in my old neighborhood so it's a nice place to reminisce.  They have an outdoor patio that overlooks Eldorado Park.  They have pool tables.  The service is always pretty good and the food is yummy.  Good prices, good times:)"}
{"text":"This is the place to be. Football, pool, trivia or a bite to eat. Their soups are awesome and Ribs Ribs Ribs Thursdays are the best. The waitstaff are friendly and The TVs always have every sporting event on. Ask for meg"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Plenty of room to play pool and other teams. The nachos are phenomenal. I always a lot of fun"}
{"text":"I've ridden my bike here with friends and lunched on the non-smoking patio a few times. I always order the Reuben and have never been disappointed. The service is good and the waitresses are friendly.

I just learned that both patios are dog friendly, as long as the dogs are leashed.  I'll add Duke's to my list of Dog Friendly establishments. Peekaboo is going to be happy to hear that."}
{"text":"Pool tables. Shuffleboards. College Football games galore. And of course, plentiful pours of the Malibu Rum :) a great spot for fun times!!! And did I mention Sundays they have free pool from 7pm to close?? Wow!!! Plus Duke is from Montana. Double the star rating!!!

Bonus points for their car service when you get a bit tipsy :)"}
{"text":"Come on, MT vs MT State charging $20 a  head. Really?  We go there during regular season and support you and the team and this is how you reward good patrons. 

Who knows of another Montana bar??"}
{"text":"This guy that works at Dukes, I just posted a pic of him. When my friend and I ordered a shot, the bartender didn't know how to make it.. that guy said the ingredients,but forgot an ingredient.  When I said it needs a splash of sprite also, he thought I didn't hear him and he said ya it needs sprite if you're gay. Now yes I am gay, but I only said it needed sprite because that is the proper way to make it.. I don't appreciate someone trying to be funny who works at your establishment drinking at your bar in their work shirts.. I liked to come here but I don't think I will be anymore.. way to go Dukes"}
{"text":"Duke's is the best neighborhood bar in this area: HANDS DOWN! The menu has been revamped and everything that I've tried is ABSOLUTELY delicious. We go there anytime we can and the service is always on par...there are fun games, lots of TVs that play all the games, and the patio is dog friendly. Great place that I'd recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food is alright here, the service is always poor, and I can't help but feel every time I come here they try to screw me outta money. Serve me a flat pitcher of beer and refuse to replace or refund it. Bad Business in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a bar guy but I really enjoy coming here. The atmosphere is laid back and has a varied mix of patrons. They have all of your classic bar games and although sometimes busy, there is always something open for you to play. Drinks are priced fairly and the bartenders work hard for their tips. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Bar food and drinks. The staff was very nice and there are plenty of TVs to watch games."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars, simply because the staff is so friendly and interactive.  I didnt catch the bartenders name (red head) but she was so nice and everyone looked to make sure that we were happy.  Watching football on a weekend day, it was very easy to make us happy.

The food is not exceptional, but very good price wise, and there are plenty of games to keep people interested.  I have taken a first date there on a few times, and it has only helped never hurt.

Based on fun and customer service I gotta give the 4th star."}
{"text":"Good service.  Food is ok, but a little expensive.  Lots of tvs.  Friendly atmosphere with all ages present.  Pretty loud.  Got the chili - it is good but they put way too much cheese in it.  They should make the cheese an option.  Got a salad as a wrap.  It is ok, but the raw carrots in it add hard cruncy bits you hae to deal with.  Finally, the Guiness tasted strange."}
{"text":"Great sports bar, tons of TVs with all sorts of sports.  Food is pretty good for a bar.  I ordered a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was prepared very well, it was not over cooked as most non-seafood specific places tend to do.  Server, Meghan, was very nice & kept my drink full.  Free wi-fi is always a plus."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. You can get any game u want. Food is above average for bar food and large menu. Great activities. Trivia, karaoke, buck hunter, pool n darts..."}
{"text":"Pretty cool sports bar in Scottsdale! We play softball at Papago so this is the perfect spot afterwards for some apps & drinks. The menu was a little expensive for what I'm used to at a sports bar ($11 for wings...). We got the sliders (3 for $6) & tots (1/2 order for $4) & 2 beers ($5 ea). It was pretty popping on a Wed around 9 pm-- I think Trivia was going on. Service was good, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location by a lake. The steak sandwich is delicious and huge! Not fatty pieces and the horseradish mayo in it is very good. Also had the spinach and artichoke dip... the dip, the most important part, was very good but the chips weren't great. Waitstaff is very friendly and attentive. Also the patio is dog friendly which is very important to this dog mom."}
{"text":"Great venue for a low-key, sports environment. They offer lots of beer on draft as well as bottled choices.

Try their potato skins w/fat kid's ketchup (i.e Ranch) - you won't be disappointed. Made me a tad bloated the next day, but still tasty and sinful.

Service was excellent - very friendly servers w/frequent check-ins."}
{"text":"Subpar at best. TV's are mediocre quality accompanied by claims they can't change the stations due to being pre-programmed. Until you don't want to order food then they miraculously change the channel. Either way alright chicken tenders without a good fry ration. All in all, their \"America's #1 Sports Bar\" banner is cause for curiosity."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I live around the block and have had more than a few good nights here. Not only are the drink specials on point, but the food is amazing as well! The hummus platter is my personal favorite but I love their salads as well. At this rate, Dukes will always remain our go-to spot :)"}
{"text":"The food is awful.  Cold and tasteless.  Service so so.  Had to tell waitress twice for items.  Beer was good"}
{"text":"Trivia night at Duke's is one of the highlights of my week. It's a great excuse to hang out at Duke's and eat some of their great food. They have quite the menu and I always have a tough time choosing what to get. I typically go with the sandwich and soup combo, but the salads are awesome too. Service is hit or miss, but not bad enough to keep me from coming back every week for trivia night :)"}
{"text":"Hand cut fries are NOT hand cut. Frozen fries just thrown in grease. The Bloody Mary bar was a stingy mess. The old lady behind the bar didn't take our order right away. We wanted breakfast, she said we couldn't order breakfast because it was after 11:00, it was 11:01. About 2 minuets later they rang the bell to indicate breakfast was over."}
{"text":"Went to Duke's again the other night and realized I had never written them up. We go there often enough. For no other reason than there is always a space at the bar and thir wings are respectable. In my many visits (happy hour pitchers are a GREAT deal), we have tried many of the sandwiches, burgers, even fish and chips. Nothing super good or super bad. Standard bar fare. Lots of ASU students working there, lots of sports on the plethora of televisions. Can get really crazy during big games. Trivia Sat nights 8 pm. Also fun. Dog friendly patio and frisbee golf right outside. What more can you ask? Also fun is watching Duke's owner (I think his name is AL) command staff to keep the place to his standards."}
{"text":"I used to live within walking distance of this place, and it has major kudos because it is on Vista Del Camino park, which has a pretty sweet disc golf course on it!  It is on hole 12 actually!  Most people make this their hole one, and finish up here!  The other cool part is you can take your dog on the patio..at least you could when I was there. 

The BBQ hot Buffalo wings, which are not on the menu, but you can ask for them and they may be available, are deeeelish!  I love em.  I also love to see a place that has a two page spread of salads.  But, I do not want said salads to come out with lettuce from the green salad mix bag, YUK!  I love salads, love love love them!  But don't be fooled by the two pages of salad options, they are all served with the premix iceburg lettuce bags. YUK again!  

I really love this place because it looks SUPER small from the outside, but is actually pretty big on the inside!  They have like 10-12 pool tables and they are in pretty good condition. They have 2 shuffle board, 2 electronic dart boards, and at least 4 old school dart boards with the chalk board scoring system!  

I definitely recommend this place if you live in the area, the bartendar's and waitresses, or waiters, will get to know you fast,, and your experience will get better every time.  Just don't go there with hopes of having dinner.  Bar food and late night snacking types o' meals!"}
{"text":"Dukes has got to have the worst wait staff I've seen these days. I used to live down the street and probably would've considered it to be my favorite dive bar in the area for a while. I've recently returned and have to say it had to be the absolute worst crap bar dining experience ever. Hopefully they still have good football Sundays. Otherwise I'd venture to say with the speed the place has gone downhill they should not be around too much longer unless the owner(very rude, drunk?, old man) has deep pockets. Unfortunately south Scottsdale does not have many good choices for sports bars. Good thing I don't live up that way anymore."}
{"text":"First time here.  Didn't know what to expect.  Pretty nice place and good selection of draft beers including local beers.  Only negative was that they don't put Buzztime trivia on a tv, have to use the tablets.  Never had that happen before.  Everyone who has Buzztime puts it on tv's. That's how you get group synergy and get your bar in the national rankings. Helps us drink more, too."}
{"text":"Service was timely. We sat in the patio to avoid the noise inside and it was perfect. The have fish and chips all the time so if you have a craving it's a perfect place.   Dog friendly patio is a plus.  Good cuts of meat cooked to order.  We will return!!"}
{"text":"Zipps or Twin Peaks ... Much better sports bars. Way cuter staff, way better food, and much friendlier guests.

Got asked to leave because I'm a fan of a team other than Arizona!

Owner (Al) and bar manager (Mike) are useless jerks. Totally rude and unaccommodating if you're a fan of anyone besides Arizona.

Oh, and sports fans beware: they do BINGO on Thursday nights. God forbid you want to watch a game that night without hearing \"Beeee... Eighteen.... Beeeee... Eighteen....\""}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place and what a mistake! The only good thing I can say about this place was out waitress Brie. She did everything she could to give us good service but that's about where it ended. It's a Friday night and they are busy but first thing the guys tried to order bud light draft and they don't have any then they don't have bud draft .  The guys finally decided on a different beer and they stirred the best with a straw to make it look fresher. As we are placing our order we are warned they are busy and it will be about 30 minutes to get food. We decided to stay instead of starting over somewhere else.  30 minutes later my husband and I get our food, 15 minutes later 2 of our friends get their food then another 15 minutes or other friends for their food. One of my friends fries were ice cold another ones order was completely wrong. The other 2 said their food wasn't  worth the wait. We complained to a bartender and they chewed out waitress out and none of it was her fault. They had our waitress in tears. While waiting we also saw 4 servers did in the trash for something and go straight to getting people's food without even washing their hands. Finally we had to be THOSE people and get a manger and they discounted or meals but that was not the point. They need better people in the kitchen better hygiene and better stocking of popular beer."}
{"text":"Perfect place to watch a game with friends on the weekend, or to just grab a beer or two after work. Love the laid back atmosphere. Pool tables, darts and shuffle boards are a great touch to this place. Thumbs up to their bloody Mary bar.....delishious!!"}
{"text":"First time at the bar and I was pleased. They had a different game on every TV. The waitress Bree was so nice and helpful. The best ever. And you get very large portions for your money. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"If you're going for trivia night go early to grab a table and food. The orders run about 45min behind once trivia is about to start. It gets packed. I've only been here in trivia nights and enjoy the atmosphere. The hamburgers and appetizers are well seasoned and in large serving sizes. The alcoholic drinks are hit or miss. Tequila sunrises, whiskey sours, and Jack and cokes were too strong or just not made well. The waitress was nice enough to take a couple drinks our tap because of the taste. I'd go back."}
{"text":"First time here in years and I must say that the quality of food has gone down hill dramatically.  Came looking for a specific game, from Gilbert, AZ mind you and they did not have my game on with sound. I understand we live in AZ and with the Cardinals but you have to accommodate all customers which they did not. They said and I quote \"This is what you got.\". The quality of food has gone down as well. Spinach and artichoke dip had very little spinach and a whole lot, over abundance of artichoke.  Pick it up Dukes.  Very dissatisfied customer."}
{"text":"I have to review Dukes because I live right next to it.  Even though it's a sports bar that looks like it fell right out of the early 90's, it's still a good place.  All the food is good bar food that's not expensive.  Great beer specials nightly and a hilarious crowd of people.  Go in and grab a seat at the bar, you'll see old drunkards, young idiot frat kids......I guess that's pretty much it, but it's still fun.  Go on Thursday for Karaoke, there are these two creepy old guys that sit seperately from one another, and just pass off the mic each song between the two of them.  It is the most awkwardly entertaining thing you will ever see.  Also, Saturday and Sunday morning bloody mary bar that you can't beat."}
{"text":"Duke's is the top place in Scottsdale that my friends and I like to hit up to watch a game, or just grab a drink and bite to eat. The place is huge, the food is priced well for a bar, and there's almost always a decent beer special.

In addition to several TVs placed around the bar, there's plenty of pool tables, dart tables, and shuffleboards to keep everyone entertained. 

The menu is big for a bar. The odd, also very good, part about that menu is the salad selection. Duke's has two pages of its menu dedicated to salads. While not something you'd expect from a sports bar, it's nice to know that there still is a healthy selection I can choose from while watching a game.

Another cool feature is Duke's \"No DUI Car.\"  It'll take you to your next destination.  How can you not like that?!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale, and Dukes is right down the road from where I live. I went twice when I first got here. The first time I went to watch the Panthers game.. since there are no Carolina bars in PHX. Our waitress was AMAZING! She was friendly and down to earth, and always went out of the way to make sure we were satisfied. The food during that visit was pretty sub-par- I got their strawberry walnut salad, and they offered me every kind of dressing ever except Balsamic Vinaigrette. I feel like that's a pretty basic dressing to have and I'm still confused as to why they have 3 fruit vinaigrettes but no balsamic- but I digress. My boyfriend got a burger medium-rare, and it came out well done. I will say, though, we ordered onion rings as an appetizer and they were SO DELICIOUS. I don't know what kind of crack they put in their breading but omg gimme dat!

The onion rings were actually what coerced me to go back a few days later- I couldn't stop thinking about them! This time I went with the BBQ chicken salad and it was better. On this visit, we met the  owners and they were both really great- we could tell that they truly cared about their business and their patrons. Definitely a plus.

My only other complaint about this bar is the lack of lighting. They have closed shutters over all of their windows. Yes, I understand this is the desert and it gets hot- but it would be nice to not feel so cramped in."}
{"text":"My boyfriend plays softball games down the street from Dukes, and we have made it a new tradition to come here after every game. Win or Lose. It's fun and convenient for his teammates and the fans to have a beer or some food after the games which in the summer league made us all very thirsty! 

You would probably never see Duke's from the street or think there could be anything worth while in this strip mall but Duke's is a buried treasure. It's a dive bar so don't get your hopes up to high, but they have great drink specials and very friendly and fast staff. 

Fall league is starting at the end of September on Tuesdays so Duke's is where I'll be Tuesday nights after the games!"}
{"text":"This is my spot.  Great food, I can watch my game with no problem.  I have to have sound.  They really treat you right.  Oh, and did I mention the awesome food.  Plus, they'll get you home safe with a free ride.  If anyone else asks you, tell them that Sunday football there sucks.  Only because we don't want it to get any more crowded.  We don't like waiting for our beers."}
{"text":"I'm at lunch at Dukes often and I enjoy the food and service. Nothing fancy but they do it right.  Great atmosphere with TVs everywhere playing your favorite sports, pool tables, etc... if your looking for a good sports bar with good food and drinks you will like this."}
{"text":"This dive bar is in the corner of Miller and Mcdowell in a strip mall.Don't be fooled by its shabby exterior this place is Huge with tons of tv's,pool tables,darts and what not.
They also have outdoor seating and a smoking patio.

During the day service is slow even when the place is empty.
~Fish and chips $12 served with coleslaw and tartar sauce.
~Buffalo chicken $10 served with a side of tater tots.

I was definitely not a fan of the fish and chips the fish wasn't even fried in a batter and the slaw tasted funny.The buffalo chicken however was delicious,it was an open face burger with lettuce,tomatoes & red onions.The chicken was tender and grilled to perfection also had some heat from the buffalo sauce.

I would say go if you're a fan of dive bars,watch a game or play some pool just not for the food.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Location always plays a role in how a place is perceived, but I think that's particularly true for Dukes. This is about the closest bar to my parents house in south Scottsdale, so I've started coming here more and more when I come to visit. It's located in a random strip mall in a fairly residential area so it's not a place that people are gonna necessarily seek out. That being said, I think if Dukes were located someplace differently (even if it were still in a strip mall) it might be thought of a LITTLE more highly.

I mean, it's big. There's a TON of TV's (they even have them in the bathrooms). The drinks are cheap (especially the happy hour specials, which I believe actually run pretty late). The have pool tables, darts, and I think even a few arcade games. There's a patio. In my experiences, it's clean for the most part. They have a LARGE food menu. To be honest, I've only tasted things here and there when others have ordered stuff, and although it's not great, it's not bad, and like the drinks the food is affordable (I believe they offer a different deal each day). They also offer some sort free car service for those who can't drive home (I believe within 5 miles). The friend I usually come here with lives within walking distance, but we've taken advantage of it before. And like I said, the strip mall where's Dukes is located is in a highly residential area so I'm sure there's a lot of people who can take advantage of this service.

The only complaint I have about Dukes is I have encountered more than one bitchy/slow server. I've never been here when it's that crowded though, so it's generally not been a big deal (might be a different story when this place is packed)."}
{"text":"A good dive bar in Scottsdale if you want to stay away from the main downtown area. Tons of Tv's which are viewable from nearly any angle you sit in the restaurant including a large TV with the main game on. Even though it was packed when we were there, staff was still friendly and fairly attentive given the crowd. Food was actually good and the beer was about average price of any place else in town. 

I will most likely be back to this bar for more games in the future."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar! The bartenders, specifically Monica, Rebecca and Mark are super friendly and provided great service. All and all an awesome watering hole."}
{"text":"Bigger than expected sports bar. They have games like foozeball and shuffle board which is fun. The food is okay at most. We had the chicken quesadilla and nachos. We had wanted a burger but a couple that we met there told us that they were told that all their meat comes to the, pre-cooked (which makes me look at restaurants different when they write that they can only cook medium+).

The service was bad, but I can't blame it on the servers. Even on a busy football Sunday, you seat yourself. The poor servers are running around and it takes forever to get anyone's attention and to get anything. 

Oh... And the no specials on Sunday / during football game is another negative."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe how rude and absurd of a man the owner is. After seeing that Duke's had the channel our favorite football team was playing on, we decided to stop in for some appetizers and sports. For the first portion of our visit, everything was okay. We ordered chips and wings, all of which were average but sufficient. On top of this we had a friendly enough server. 

As many do, upon eating we stuck around to watch more of the game. That's when everything turned sour... or more specifically we had the delight of meeting the owner. Now, the owner was someone we noticed from the beginning of our meal, as he sat at the bar eating nachos and cheering against the U of A as they played their game (not for their opponent, just enthusiastically against them). Upon realizing we were Wildcat fans we soon became recipients of many dirty looks, but remained unfazed thinking he was just another restaurant patron. As the half progressed the looks became more frequent, and we realized that despite being quiet and respectful customers, he clearly had an issue with us. During halftime he made it known, as he rushed to our table, angrily grabbed our napkins off the table, and then proceeded to condescendingly yell at us, demanding we order more food or get out. We understood his point (although it could have been delivered more kindly), and began picking out new items to order. We then ordered, only to be angrily reapproached by the owner five minutes later yelling at us and asking whether we had chosen something to order. We explained that we had, at which point he then said, \"WAIT!!! Are you guys 21?!\" We replied that one of the three of us were, promoting him to yell at the top of his lungs, \"STOP. STOP. YOU CANNOT BE HERE WITHOUT ADULTS!\" We had seen many children and had seen no signs explaining this policy, and were left extremely confused, and with an entire restaurant of people turned in their seats to watch him yell at us, with their jaws dropped. He then said our order was cancelled and we had to leave. 

In all honesty this review doesn't do the situation justice at all. The owner was an EXTREMELY rude and aggressive drunk man, who singled us out over a sports rivalry (there were MANY other tables of people watching sports without food on their tables, and we had done literally nothing to draw his attention or disapproval). He treated us extremely immaturely and condescendingly, and showed no evidence of skills in customer service. In fact, one of his staff even came up to us and apologized for the owner being a \"drunk a$$hole.\" We left sad and embarrased, not to mention angry. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"We stopped in this morning.  The door was open, but the waitress finally came over and said, \"we don't actually open for 30 min\" (hmm, so maybe keep the door locked?).  We live in the area and this was our second time at Duke's.  Our first time the food was ok, but the customer service is really lacking!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Duke's on Wednesday nights for Trivia. It's probably the best sports bar in Scottsdale. Here are TVs all over the place and they actually have the volume on!

The food is always decent. Some things are better than others but I haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after we had school open house. We ordered food. 2 of us got moldy bread sandwiches. We told them about the mold... They fixed the sandwiches with new ones...didn't give us anything off the bill after the 2 of them are half of the sandwich. Hope they dont get sick and we need to call the doctor because they have food poisoning. 
They let us fill out a bunch of birthday cards...you get $10.00 off your bill on your birthday.   
Yay!!  Free mold..."}
{"text":"I asked for a beer with no foam and was told, by the bartender, they couldn't do that with the owner standing right next to us. I asked him for a beer with no foam and he replied \"ain't gonna happen-a beer with no head is a naked beer\". He added more negativity. It wasn't an unreasonable request...but the response didn't need to act like it was. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ugh....when you have thoughts that you are going to a dive bar, and you get this?  Not a pleasant thought.

Went there with a friend on Saturday night (can you all guess who that was??? LOL)  and the first thing I kept on thinking was...\"Wow this place is bright.\"  Very sports bar atmosphere with horrible Karaoke and weird people.  

Yes, there were a lot of ladies there....so the pickings for men were slim.  I had a couple of drinks and all I wanted was to find a decent guy to stick my tongue down his throat!  (Kidding, y'all)  All I got was some pretty boy who thought we were talking about curling and some weird dude next to us who sings a bad ass Barry Manilow. 

Oh!  And when we were waiting for our ride (plus on the car service availability) some weird freak of nature walked up to us outside.  He was talking to me in some weird radio announcer voice in my ear.  All I wanted to do was run hom and shower and sanitize my hair and ear.  

2 stars for the chicken fingers (yummy) and car service.  

So not a dive bar."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and just amazing welcoming staff. Tvs galore. MLB package and amazing friendly service"}
{"text":"Pros: Dog friendly patio. Separate Non-smoking and smoking patios. Overlooks greenbelt. 

Cons: No Happy Hour food specials?!!! All apps are $9-$11 (wings are $11!!!). 

Maybe that's why it's dead inside and out on a gorgeous day during HH."}
{"text":"This place is a joke!!! Just went in here with my friend and her sister and ordered water with the intention of ordering food. Immediately we got carded. My friends sister is 15 years old but my friend is her legal guardian. I asked \"why do we need  and ID when we are just ordering food and water\". She says that's the rules. I said I've been here many times and never carded when eating and ordering food. She said well to bad that's the rules and I can grab a manager of you would like. I said yes please. She sent someone over named Mark. He didn't introduce himself as the manager but said what's the problem. We explained and he said that the rule. We said we understand that but we are ordering a water. He said that's the rule. I said you know I've been here several times and have inconsistent service. I don't understand why ordering a water props a waitress to ask for an id. He said that rule. I asked why is it when I go to Applebee's I can order food and a water and not get carded. Why can I go to Philly's down the street and do the same thing with out getting carded. He said of you don't like it then you can leave. I said I've had several issues with this place and have written bad reviews and corrected them because management has fixed the problem. But this is ridiculous. He said then why do you keep coming back if it's that bad. I said because it wasn't managements fault it was the staff but this time it's management which means that this place is dysfunctional on all levels. We walked out angry and upset and with no resolution. I believe most restaurants would have handled this much differently. I prefer to give them my business and money.


Also forgot to add It was 6:30pm when we went in not 9 where I would understand being carded."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  We had the club sandwich and irish nachos ... so good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Our hotel shuttle driver recommended it to us as a midpoint from our hotel to the Scottsdale Stadium (shuttle can only drive a 5 mile radius and the stadium was outside the radius, but save us money for a taxi he could drop us off here, and there is a free shuttle that takes you from Duke's to the stadium).

Pros:
(+) $4 mimosas. What a deal!
(+) Awesome atmosphere (cool laid back sports bar)
(+) A plethora of TVs so you can watch whatever game, wherever in the bar
(+) Bartender was friendly 
(+) Games as well - shuffleboard and billiards from what I saw, there may be more but I don't know
(+) Looked like a sufficient food menu
(+) Tons of seating

Cons:
None! Seemed like an awesome place. We were only there for about twenty minutes and it was the middle of the day, but I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is huge and has so many TVs that every sports fan should be satisfied. Food is excellent, even have breakfast on weekends for the early games! It's right on the park and has a beautiful outside patio"}
{"text":"The worst!! It took the waitress nearly half an hour to bring us our drinks, and nearly an hour and a half to get our food (and our appetizer came out with the main course). When we finally did get our food, it was cold, and the bread on my sandwich had hardened - it actually cut my mouth it was so stale! Our waitress ignored us so effectively that we had to find a different server to help us replace the dish so I could actually eat. I cut this place a little slack because it was trivia night, and thus very busy, but still. Bad service is bad service. At least the trivia was fun."}
{"text":"Last visit was a vast improvement... It is always based on the level of service.  It was really cool to see a bunch of military recruits there- always a plus.  The guy at the table next to us snagged their bill before we could - an indication of the caliber of people that frequent the place.  The server will make or break your experience - the food is good, the atmosphere is great for family, friends and/or a great night out however the experience is contingent on the service...  the park behind the place is a great view too."}
{"text":"Awesome place for sports watching! Better than any other place, besides being at the game live. 

They have tons of TVs, no way I could count them all. Around 50 or so if I had to guess. If you post yourself up at the bar you have at least 8 right in front of you, perfect for watching multiple games at a time. Now if you only had more eyes to spread around then you would be set. 

Their food menu is huge too, something for everyone. Great appetizers/finger food, awesome sandwiched and 30 different salad for the healthy minded. The Reuben and Ahi tuna salad are a few of my faves. 

The bar backs up to the golf course so you have a great view while sitting on the back patio. Like I said there is something to entice anyone. 

Word of advise: if you are a Cowboys fan, DO NOT go here! You have been warned."}
{"text":"This spot was conveniently located right by the hotel I was staying at for work. I decided to go there since it was past 10pm and most places near by were closed already. All of the bartenders were very nice and struck conversation. There's a ton of TV's. Which is great for a day of watching all your sporting events. They even had a complimentary taxi service to avoid drunk driving and DUI's. I thought that was cool. I ordered the Cajun Salmon Salad. It was extremely boring! The food I'd give 2 stars. The 3rd star is because I was happy with the Customer Service."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a regular. 

Duke's is a local sports bar in south Scottsdale. It's right on the green belt, so it's convenient for cyclists, disc golfers, and dog walkers who use the park. The property kind of has two sections to its patio with both overlooking the park. 

There is a lot of space inside with tons of TVs. There are pool tables, shuffle board, arcade games, etc. They have bar trivia twice a week, and the regular emcee is friendly. 

I usually just drink beer here as far as alcoholic drinks go. They usually have at least four IPAs on tap which I wish they'd rotate in some other ales. If you order a pitcher, they'll give you an ice chiller. 

I think the food is good. It's not fried dive bar food. They have some unique dishes. I usually order the sliders, steak salad, fried shrimp, or chicken tenders. 

The service is great. Lots of personable bartenders and waitresses who are attentive and friendly. They'll put on any game you request, too, without hassle. The owner is regular, and he'll say hi to customers. 

It's a great spot for catching a game, pit stop for park guests, bar trivia night, or if you live in the area, for pregaming or capping off a night in Old Town or on Mill."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's really bright inside, has tons of huge televisions, more pool tables than you can imagine, lots of places to sit, and several various bar games... just a billion things to see and do here. It's like a fucking carnival in Vegas.

The drinks and specials are quite reasonable, and they have a pretty good selection of beers on tap. They have a good bar menu and lots of salads. I had a chicken caesar and it was mighty fine... I saw some of the other food and it looked pretty rich and greasy. Don't go here expecting to get diet food. The rest of the menu is nachos, burgers, sandwiches, soups, wings and other assorted deep fried stuff. Even though they let me put my own dressing on my salad, and I didn't use much, 

The crowd sucked when I was here, but I imagine it varies wildly on any given night. The staff was super nice. I mean, the friendliest bartender I've ever met. This place has so many things going for it, but so many things against as well. For starters, it's located in a hidden useless strip mall behind a Denny's and a Peter Piper Pizza. It's also trying to be too much. It's like a local dive bar with lofty aspirations and a high self-esteem.

It's totally worth going to, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone unless they asked specifically for something exactly like this... but such a request would be unlikely. They have a long list of things going on here, so if this is close enough to your neighborhood to make it your neighborhood bar - you could do worse."}
{"text":"Drink refills are $1.00. Since free refills are industry standard in the U.S., it makes restaurants that do charge come across as greedy, insulting, or unappreciative of the business. 
Ordered 2 small fountain drinks for my kids ($3.90 total) and they wanted $1.00 each for refills. We could have stayed there all night getting free refills and Dukes still would not have lost money. 
Spoke with the manager but she stood her ground on the rule.
Food was average for bar food. Perks were bike parking by the patio so you could sit buy your bike if you're on a ride through the park and free WiFi.
In the future we'll be stopping at Zipps instead. 
Sorry to see them lose future business trying to squeeze a couple extra dollars out of me on one visit."}
{"text":"Wow...I've never been to such an unpleasant place in my life. First of all, it took 30 minutes for us to even see our waitress. She took our orders another 30 minutes after finally bringing our drinks, Then brought our food an hour after that. Our order was completely wrong and some of our food didn't even come out till 2 hours after it was ordered. Our waitress was rude and had no idea what she was doing. The manager wasn't helpful at all either. I definitely do not recommend ever going here...I know I never will again."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood grill without pretensions and with good draft beer. Dog friendly and great patios (a smoking and a non-smoking one)!  Just wish they still had the peanut butter and jelly burger!"}
{"text":"Our neighbors told us about the prime rib at dukes, we went last week, our first and last time, not cooked there the bartender told us, so you can only have maybe Med, we like ours rare, I would just go and pick up from AJs!"}
{"text":"Took over a hour to get our food,  order was wrong so had to wait again... Didn't take it off the menu with either wanted to charge us for a refill too. Didn't check on us much, no apologies and we had to ask for the check. Soda was still almost $3. I got water, I know how nickel and dime this place can be. Used to love them, now... Nevermind. Server was chill but lacked emotion and enthusiasm, tired maybe, but dealing with that wrong order was wack..."}
{"text":"Dukes mails me out a Free Appetizer ( $ 10) for my Birthday . When I go in they Refuse to honor it .Show them my Drivers License . Still Refuse . It's Ok , will NEVER set foot in the place Again ! Save me from spending $ 500 on $6 IPA during Football season . Thank you Dukes for saving me $$$$ this Fall"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to give this review because the secret squirrel status of this place adds to the overall outstanding rating. In my opinion, the perfect sports bar. Big place with tons of tvs showing a variety of sports. Friendly and competent staff. Draft beer (and full bar). Wings and numerous other bar food options. This place is a sports fan's sports bar. If you are looking for fancy anything, just keep on moving, this isn't for you. But, if want a place to be with real people and eat real food with a cold beer (or other adult beverage of choice), then you will enjoy Duke's hospitality and straightforward offerings."}
{"text":"In walking distance and pet friendly! It sure beats the hell out of pranksters scene and service. The servers are always so friendly and give your puppies treats and water. The food is okay. But for drinking a pitcher on the patio and relaxing mixed with the small amount of exercise you get from the short walk it is definitely becoming a bar that I am a frequent customer at!"}
{"text":"Free car service to get you there and home safe??? Hell yea!

Dukes is a divey, large sports bar with a million TVs, decent food, and cheap ass drinks.

Specials every night ($2 burgers on Mondays), Karaoke on Wednesday and Saturday... Pool tables, shuffleboard, a misted patio for smokers, etc...

Located close to old town - so this is a great place to get your party started!

This is a found treasure :)"}
{"text":"We go here after softball games on Thursday night. The drinks are cheap, the food is great, and the service is outstanding. The biggest draw to this place is the bar itself. It has lots of pool tables and dart boards, two huge patios that overlook the green belt and lots of TVs. My only complaint is the Karaoke they do on Thursday. It is horrible and ruins the whole vibe there. Oh, and they have the no DUI car that will drive you home for free...but don't forget to tip."}
{"text":"Awesome meal. The Tuna Steak Caesar salad hit the spot. A late night snack put a smile on this face. Great tunes, and a nice outdoor patio ... Non smoking makes it nicer , Megan made sure everyone was filled and satisfied with what they want."}
{"text":"I'm not a big bar person so I didn't come for the drinks or the atmosphere. I met some friends here for drinks and something to eat. The service was really quick and I have to say I ordered a BLT and it was one of the best I've had anywhere. Also it came with coleslaw and it was really good too. Not many places get coleslaw right but Dukes did."}
{"text":"Duke's is quite an interesting place, hidden away in a random Scottsdale shopping mall. I've been here a few times for team trivia with friends- both Wednesday's and Friday's. One of the organizers has frequented for a few years and notes that it's never busy one night over the other. You'll see a variety of patrons at Duke's, it's not a typical place for one group or another.

Service is kind of hit or miss, sadly. One evening the server was on point! He knew when to swing by & ask for refills, the food didn't take long to order and be delivered. And it appeared had a bunch of tables- my props to him. One of my more recent trips was the opposite, surprisingly since they weren't terribly busy. The guy seemed very out of it. He walked by our table a few times without acknowledging our attempts to get his attention, and also disappeared the entire time it took for our food to be delivered (25-30min). Cashing out was quite painful with him too. 

The food is just kind of meh. I was told they pride themselves on salads, but I've not been impressed- over-dressed, not a lot of anything else. The totchos are decent, nothing else is really worth mentioning. I'll probably return since my friends love it and I love trivia."}
{"text":"So, I called to place a To-Go order and the staff member that answered said they were to busy to take the order....  Remind me to not call them in the future and to spend my money somewhere else.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place definitely was a great stop while getting my car looked at. Thanks Eddie for the recommendation!

When I first walked in Dukes this place was busy for lunch. I walked into the bar and took a seat. I was immediately greeted by a nice lady. She handed me a menu and I was a little overwhelmed with how big it was. I quickly scanned it and saw they had a breaded pork tenderloin! Coming from the Midwest this is a staple I had very frequently coming from Iowa. I placed my order and realized they had a ton of TVs! My food arrived very quickly and I destroyed the pork tenderloin and tator tots! This place was a quick in and out for lunch while the staff was very friendly! They checked on me over 10 times start to finish. Thanks for the great service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"For a sports bar this one is one of the most underrated but most awesome places in Scottsdale.  Big game days can make it get packed so arrive early if you want a seat.  There are plenty of TVs through the bar so being able to see a game is always possible.  
They have the main bar area, a dining area, 2 large group rooms which can be reserved for parties and work functions.  There are areas for pool, darts, and other fun games. They offer karaoke nights and team trivia nights.  They also have ample patio seating with both a smoking and nonsmoking sides. The patio overlooks part of the green belt and the Shelby disc golf course.  Dogs are welcome on the patio too. 

The food isn't fine dinning quality but it is one of the best bar foods I've had (and I grew up touring sports bar with my pops so I have tried many)  They have a fabulous burger called the egg McDuke in once a fried egg is topping off your burger.  Probably my favorite dish.  Most of their appetizers and salads are phenomenal. 

I am never disappointed by their drinks. The beer specials are always great tasting. Their shots are ridiculous in size and always potent.  The best feature about Dukes is their no DUI service.  This is a free cadillac chauffeured ride home so that you don't have to drive drunk. More places should offer such a service."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review, we came here yesterday for NFL Week 1 and we enjoyed ourselves very very much. Got to the bar at 9:30am, walked up to the door and they had a tv map already done outside so you know exactly where your game was being showed, we were there for Lions/Vikings and they had it on in the lounge with sound. 

Got in early enough to grab a seat on the couch that made our experenice that much better. Our server(s) were as prompt as they could be seeing it was very busy. 

The crowd was upbeat and fun and the atomsphere was great.

We will be back for Weeks 3-17, since I'll be at the game next Sunday here.

Go Lions!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The new menu is great!! I love how doggy friendly they are :) I read all of bad reviews and i feel like those people are just pretentious! This is a sports bar environment! The servers are always friendly. I actually saw a guy get kind of rude with their server there, and they handled it very professionally (way better than I would have handled it)"}
{"text":"Horrible,horrible service and supremely overpriced food. $11 for 10 tiny wings? Really?"}
{"text":"Great place. The Duke burger is very good alone with the tater tots."}
{"text":"This bar is located on the greenbelt. So when you're riding you're bike and feel a little thirsty, just ride up and have a drink. The fish and chips were yummy. I tried not eat all of it but I couldn't resist. The fish was thinly breaded, which was awesome. But I felt like it was overcooked. I may need to try it again. The steak was okay. The bartenders were super nice but I forgot their names. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. The food is terrible. I mean, really, really, bad. The majority if the servers have zero personality. 
The drink specials are good and they dislike Cowboys (the football team), so thats a plus."}
{"text":"This place could be great if not for the owner!  While having a conversation with the manager about a very small issue (and we where having a pleasant conversation) this old man walked up and stood behind the manager.  I asked the manager, \"who is this gentleman?\"  Turned out to be the owner who proclaimed, \"I OWN THE F*****G PLACE, THAT\"S WHO I AM....WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!?!\"  I asked the manager if I'd said something wrong and he stood quiet.  It was clear he deals with this a lot.  Maybe it's because his boss sits at the bar and drinks and then tries to interject when he clearly shouldn't.  The story goes on from here, but I digress.  My friends and I paid out tab for one pitcher of beer (so we where there less than 20 min) and took our business elsewhere.  After spending $286.00 at the other location it has become our new hangout.  There is another post here about the owner kicking out a Kings fan....I find that story COMPLETELY believable after what we had happen.  I wouldn't spend ten cents in this place all because of the owner!"}
{"text":"Watched the Cardinals game here today. Super crowd, breakfast burrito was delicious.  Our server Brandy, was attentive but not hovering. Al, the owner is passionate and fun loving!  Key: don't be a tight ass with a shitty attitude and you will have a great time!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night.  It was busy but not packed.  One of us ordered a burger (special of the day) and the other fish and chips (a regular menu item).  It took 40 minutes to get our food.  Reason:  we are geared up for cooking burgers tonight not fish and chips.  Really!!!  So if you order something other than the special of the day, it is going to take forever to get you meal. Won't be back anytime soon......besides, their prices on regular items have gone up considerably in the past year or so......"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a dive bar that just oozes sports...this is the place to be! Now, Dukes is a great place to settle in for a Cardinals game because they an official Cardinals headquarters. Not to mention you get a free shot after a Cardinals touchdown if you are wearing gear with the logo on it! 

They are also an ASU bar, but let's not get into that. You won't find me there for those games....beardown! They have so many TV's of all shapes and sizes around the bar so I'm sure you'll find a game or sport that you enjoy. Not to mention its a big place with multiple sitting areas, indoor and outdoor...and yes they have a couple tv's outside!

I haven't tried many things on their menu yet but I am a huge fan of their Honey Hot wings. They are delicious!! Last night I tried their Wednesday ribs special and the barbeque sauce is so yummy. Next time I'm ordering their chicken tenders buffalo style! On Sunday's they have a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar that goes till 4pm. 

Last night I was also able to experience my very first Trivia Night! It was a lot of fun and the rules are pretty straight forward and simple, however, the questions are not as the night goes on! It was nice to get out on a week night to try something different. I think they have Trivia Night twice a week. 

The staff is friendly, our server last night was awesome. It's a sport's bar, with bar food, and sport's bar decor, nothing fancy, nothing special, but it is a welcoming, have a good time kinda place."}
{"text":"I come here about every 3 weeks. Always enjoy The Dip or the Rueben.  Service is consistently very good and attentive. Krissy is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Has a patio and dogs are welcomed. Inside the bar, many tv's are mounted and positioned well to enjoy games. food was tasty. service was at best mediocre. we were there two hours and our waiter failed to refill my water until he brought me the bill. It was an acceptable place to watch a game in a pinch, but not likely to return."}
{"text":"Oh good ole Dukes. 
This place is what it is... A sports bar with no frills or fluff and I like it. 
Tons of TVs to watch sports and if you get bored you can play pool, darts, arcade, and even buck hunter (my fave)!
The food is nothing to rave about but not bad at all. We always order the wings, fish and chips, quesadilla, and of course tater totts. 
Don't come here and expect the scene you'll get from old town. This place is for locals and friends... The more the merrier in a casual environment. 

Ps: they have trivia night and I've done it a few times and had a blast!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!  Old crowd and ragging old drunkin' Owner!!

Go to Papago Brewery instead. 

DO NOT SUPPORT BAD BUSINESSES !

Review Below:

Ive been to this bar a few times, every time I leave annoyed.  The bar is in a great location, and they have a dog friendly patio - last night I found out why it's so terrible.  While getting a drink my dog kindly walked over to the owner, he then began shouting at me and my dog.  He drunkenly ranted about how the dog 'looked' like it might take a poop, I asked if he hates dogs so much and looses his ability to control his voice to a paying customer, why he would even say dog are allowed.  

This place finally makes sense; it's the worst bar around because the owner is an old angry drunkin' man.  I actually feel sorry for his wife, as she stood there in all of the glory that was his anger, ragging at an upstanding military veteran and paying customer, in what must be a failing bar."}
{"text":"Shuffleboard, pool, golf arcade game, foosball and dartboards make for a fun time at this place.
They also have a HUGE interior bar with plenty of space for seating. We typically go during the day so it's slow. We've gone a few times at night and there was live music playing, which is awesome.
Wednesday nights they do live trivia at 7:30pm and Karaoke on Thursday and Saturday nights. 

If you aren't interested in singing or competing in anything.... theres a bunch of TVs so it's cool to go to watch sports games.
They have really affordable food and specials everyday. 
Here's the breakdown:
MONDAY: is a burger, turkey burger or pork sandwich for 3.50 (+1.00 for fries)
TUESDAY: is prime rib with salad and fries for 10.75
WEDNESDAY: is ribs served with coleslaw, fries or potato salad for 9.75. Or their healthier option of one of their salads they offer for 8.50
THURSDAY: is the same rib offer from Wednesday.
FRIDAY: is the shrimp platter with fries and coleslaw for 8.95 Or Baja fish tacos for 8.95 that come with fries.
SATURDAY: Jack Daniels marinated steak! With salad and baked potatoes for 10.75

Another great thing about this place is how accommodating they are if you have a large party, you can bring 50+ people without having to pay reservation fees and all that nonsense like a lot of restaurants/bars will do you in the scottsdale. 

Also, I've never had to use it... since I live 10 minutes away walking distance, but they do free \"avoid a DUI\" drives home from here...thats super legit. 

I will forever love this place!"}
{"text":"Woah Nelly! The exterior give no indication how spectacularly large the interior is.

That's probably a good thing given how packed this place is on Sundays during football season. I came here as part of a UYE Jeff E. planned (thanks el Jefe!). I was stunned when I opened the door. 

More like floored by the amount of people. Luckily they sent a hunting party to find me.  You need to get here early (before they open) to claim a table during NFL season. No joke! 

The televisions are fairly large. So no matter where you're seated you're guaranteed a sweet view.

For food I ordered sliders as I wasn't up for a big plate of food. A set of (3) were only $6. They were delish!"}
{"text":"First off, I have never seen a double spread on a sports bar menu for just salads-- wow!  We got just some fried appetizers to accompany all our booze so I can't say more about the food except that it came really really fast and killed the hunger pain that had set in prior.

Paula was our server and we were a really rowdy mix of people and she handled the gang  well--  attentive, fast, friendly.

TVs all over the walls, a decent looking patio, pool tables, Golden Tee type arcade games and my favorite, shuffle board. 

Sound was at a good level, almost wished it was louder b/c our conversation was pretty offensive and I didn't want others to hear it!"}
{"text":"Yah! Found another great place for lunch near the office. Had the Tuna Steak Caesar Salad and it was fantastic - huge chunk of tuna and only $8.50

This place is always packed at lunch. $2.50 burgers on Monday, $6.95 prime rib on Tuesday, $6.50 Salads - 29 of them, on Wednesday. You get the picture.

BOTTOM LINE: Good 'n cheap eats for Lunch. Probably a great place to watch sports too, but I go there for lunch"}
{"text":"Sports bar?  If it's not in the AZ area, they don't have a clue.   They would rather play UFC replays that regional college basketball.   No consideration when asked to change channels.  \"TVs are set as they are. \" was the answer we received.   Slow service, mediocre food and hostile bartenders round out this experience."}
{"text":"A group of us went here Friday night to watch the Stanley Cup Final- and like another reviewer we were told to go to the pool room to watch the game. So we finished our drinks and went to Max Sports Grill. Love the fact that Dukes is on the green belt and very close to home- but really disappointed when we were told by our waitress that the owner hated hockey and he feels it doesnt bring in business so he refuses to put it on with sound in the main bar. Well it brought 6 of us in and we left because of the owner's personal preference (and we still had a couple more people that were going to join us).   I think it is safe to say for our group that next time we will just go straight to Max's"}
{"text":"We go here regularly - it's a good sports bar with decent grub.  Lots of pool tables and other activities you would find in a sports bar - but with a staff that sets it over the top.  I can't rave about the food but I can tell you it's consistently good, but not great.  They do have a great variety of salad options (and wraps) that is fairly unique for a sports bar setting.  The location over the park is excellent, great for locals to ride bikes or walk to."}
{"text":"Duke's was a semi-regular hangout for me and my friends for their trivia and karaoke nights.  We were willing to overlook the meh food (seriously, their food used to better, now it's really not good), outdated decor, too loud TVs because it was fun to participate in those nights.  But after our last experience we are boycotting Duke's from now on.

We came with a group of 10 people.  From the start my friend told our server that we were going to split tabs.  NO mention from the server that she would not split our tab.  After eating my meal, I ask the server for my bill.  NO mention from the server that she would not split our tab.  End of the night there is a beer that has not been assigned to anyone's tab.  We all double-check our bills and they are all correct -- no one at our table ordered that beer.  

Instead of the server thinking \"hey maybe it's my mistake\" (after all the restaurant had earlier tried to serve us a Dr Pepper we didn't order and a burger we didn't order.... so it's not like they've got the most organized system in the world) she shot at us \"I'm bringing the manager\" and stomped off.  Honestly, it was like a $4 beer.  I was about to pay for it, even though I hadn't ordered it, until the server started acting like such a brat.

Then the manager comes over and proceeds to berate us and tell us \"this is why we don't split tabs for groups this big\"  Me and my friends are all thinking \"uhhh... okay... then why DID you?\"  My friend even told the manager \"we want to fix this mistake, we just want to figure out what happened.\"  But of course, instead of working with us to solve the problem, the manager just chooses to ignore my friend and keep lecturing.  Instead of talking back to her, which I really felt like doing, we just sat and let her talk down to us (even though we had done nothing wrong) and left and vowed never to return.

In the future we'll probably stick to going to Thirsty Lion for trivia nights.  The food is a LOT better, the atmosphere is nicer, and most importantly we've never been yelled at like we were little children when going there....

We even won a $20 gift certificate for getting 2nd place at trivia, but NONE of us are willing to go back there so looks like it will go un-used!"}
{"text":"Don't ask me why, but came in to Dukes again and paid $2.95 for an Iced Tea.  Then proceeded to pay $2.00 for each refill.  $6.95 for Iced Tea?   I guess we will be drinking water going forward."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to grab a quick bite before my pedicure appointment close by.  I found a nice spot at the bar, and was immediately greeted by the bar tender and brought a cold glass of ice water.  

I reviewed the menu, and then ordered a small Cobb Salad, with medium rare Steak on it.  Whey my salad came out, it was larger than I expected, and delicious.  The steak portion was generous, and it was delicious and perfectly cooked.  All of the ingredients were fresh, and when I realized that the kitchen had left off the boiled egg, the bar tender quickly ran back to the kitchen and brought me the missing egg.

It was a very comfortable experience, and I intend to go back to enjoy that salad again sometime soon."}
{"text":"We went to Dukes last night and had a great time! We ordered cheese sticks, which were delicious but a little cold in the middle, hot wings which were fantastic, meaty and classic . The ribs  pulled right off the bone and came with creamy coleslaw. The drinks were so cheap. 4.25 for a vodka cranberry and 8.50 for martinis. The bonus was team trivia. The questions were not too easy nor too hard and everyone seemed to be having fun with it. We came in 5th but in our defense, there were only 2 of us playing and all other teams had like 5 -8 people. The only complaint is that the game, the jukebox and the trivia emcee were all playing so it was hard to hear the questions. They should turn off the other stuff when trivia os on. Our bartenders were great and although they wear name tags, I forgot their names...Crow and Monique, maybe? Ran into some old friends and a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE dukes! Come in a few times a week and have the best time with my girl friend. Staff members are extremely nice and food and drink prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've had fun hanging out here, especially since it's walking distance from the apartment. However, the beer selection and food menu are mediocre... With so many craft breweries popping up in the Easy Valley, it's hard to justify not supporting local breweries, especially when some of these local breweries also offer awesome menus."}
{"text":"Duke's is a great place to grab a beer and watch a game. Weekday lunch is busy at Duke's but the salads are great and cheap. Check out the crispy buffalo chicken salad..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 11:40 am.  Saturday, today.  The menu items were off limits, but could have breakfast and all the appetizers, until 12 noon.  Really?
Sales prevention team."}
{"text":"When I first moved into Scottsdale from Tempe I wanted a dive bar next to my house like I always had in Tempe.  For 3mos I didn't even know Dukes existed!  Luckily I finally found my way over into the random strip mall it's tucked into and checked it out.  So....the most important thing other than beer? Fried food.  And there's is amazing!  Fried zucchini was d'lish!  I also noticed that they had a ton of games on the other side of the bar that I didn't have a chance to check out.  I have only been once so far but I can guarantee it won't be my last !  It's about to be cruiser season and you better believe I'll be recruiting friends to ride cruisers over, eat amazing fried food, drink beers and play games!  Let's get the fall/winter kicked off right! Am I right? :)"}
{"text":"Holy Moley Duke's - What a crowd for the first Sunday of the NFL Season. I know you open at 9:30 and by 10:00 there was barely a seat in the place. Loved the way you set up the rooms with various games on the larger screens and that Bloody Mary Bar was perfect. This place was hopping and the service couldn't have been better. We had breakfast steak and eggs. The rib-eye was fantastic and the eggs were cooked as ordered. The potatoes were pretty sad though - sorry Duke's. They tasted like they had been sitting in a pot for quite some time. Drinks were cold and like I said, the set-up was really good. They even covered the pool tables to make extra seating for fans. I'd come back here for sporting events but I would get here MUCH MUCH earlier!!"}
{"text":"We have seen our server walk back and forth and never talk to us. Just wanted a beer and some food but that's to much to ask. This place is AWFUL"}
