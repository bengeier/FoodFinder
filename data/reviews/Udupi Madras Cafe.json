{"text":"I have been to Udupi Madras Cafe multiple times and the variety of DOSA'S there is incredible. I love the mysore masala dosa, Chettinadu Masala Dosa, the delicious chili paneer masala dosa and the list goes on. The desserts are equally great. Dont forget to try the Udupi Special GADBAD Ice Cream, its one thing you cannot miss if you go to udupi. On saturday and sunday, it even has an awesome BREAKFAST BUFFET with variety of chutneys, south indian delicacies like vada, idli, Upma,Pongal, sheera etc.  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is friendly and overall ambiance is great. The decor allows the simplistic beauty of the food to really shine. It's one place that really reminds me of my native place and the culture of India."}
{"text":"This place is one of the good south Indian places. Food quality is good and the place is clean. A bit spicy, but that's how south Indian food is supposed to be. Good overall value and I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing and wonderful surprise that we found on Yelp when our two other Indian choices in Mississauga didn't pan out.

I've had dosas before (mostly on Toronto's Gerrard Street and in New York City), but these were definitely the best I've ever tasted: flavourful pancake and nicely balanced spices in the filling. The chaat papri as well as the dessert and chai were similarly tasty with wonderfully intense flavours.

Prices were very reasonable, and the atmosphere was best described by girlfriend as an upscale \"South Indian Diner\" with families, elderly groups, and young couples all enjoying straightforward but delicious food in a bright, friendly room."}
{"text":"Bottom line the food is delicious, but the service is mediocre at its best. We ( 6 of us) were there on a Saturday. We ordered Vadas as our apps. Vadas are crispy but slightly oily for my taste. I ordered the famous paper dosa. It was extra crispy, just way I like it. However the potato filling was slightly bland and you would not really care much as the condiments they gave compensate for it. In terms of service, the entrees were brought at different times rather than at the same time. The washrooms were not that clean. Overall I had a positive experience dining here. Dat crsipy dosa mmmhmmmm :)"}
{"text":"Decent food....weekend brunch buffets are better deal"}
{"text":"- Great food, wish it was consistent and i would give it 5/5. Awesome buffet over the weekends. Service is good too."}
{"text":"I mostly eat North Indian but this place is just amazing. Great dosas and great lunch buffet.

I usually end up here at least twice a week. Although it's a South Indian restaurant, the channa masala and batura are better than any North Indian place I've been too. Prices are the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden in a commercial complex in the heart of Mississauga, so I don't think it gets a lot of passersby business. This place was recommended by my sister, who used to work nearby, so we tried it. 

As a huge fan of South Indian cuisine, I've experienced many dosa huts around the city. I have to say that Udupi is my absolute favourite now. Their service is friendly, the food comes quickly, and it tastes fresh and is delicious. 

I had the chili cheese dosa. The dosa skin is crispy at the edges, and hearty in the centre. The cheese was perfectly melted, but my only 'complaint' was the chilis weren't spicy enough. But I think they toned it down cause we weren't brown :p the dosa is not too oily and rips easily, minimizing the sloppy mess that can come with eating with your hands. 

I will be back for your, chili cheese dosa. I love you."}
{"text":"Went there last week and a young man our server was really good. The construction during dinner time was awkward but food was good. Tried Mysore dosa yum!
Was short on curd so couldn't have curd rice that day!
But will come back another day!"}
{"text":"This place has great Dosas. Small hole in the wall, but those are the best finds!"}
{"text":"Love it! Eat in is best because steam makes takeout soft.  Hard to get a seat for bigger groups, but 2 can get in no problem.  Very good food at amazing price.  I love every type of dosa there.  Clean eating area."}
{"text":"The place has authentic South Indian food. It's not really to go crazy for but it's pretty decent. I prefer going for the weekend buffet since it has a lot of options. 
North Indian food is not good at all."}
{"text":"Glad to have found some vegetarian Indian while in my short stint in Mississauga for work, but the food was hit or miss.  I did eat here twice, so it's definitely worth checking out, and far better than food court fare, which is what you are stuck with when staying at a hotel by Square One.....

The dosi are definitely their strong point, which I'm guessing is the reason why it is the main part of their menu.  Nicely crafted and the 2 different fillings I tried were very tasty.  However, I had a couple things that were just plain bland.  I forget the name, but the appetizer that is a donut shaped lentil-fritter- good concept, but very bland.  Also, the lentil based \"pizzas\" (forget the name... again) was very bland, and the worst part was that we ordered the vegetable one, and literally, the vegetables were that bagged, frozen, corn/peas/diced carrots mix.  Yikes.

All in all, definitely a place to consider in Mississauga, but stick to the dosi!"}
{"text":"Never again. Very poor service and unfriendly staff. Stale food. Recommend staying away from this place. Gurulakshmi n Sarvanaah Bhavan are 10 times better."}
{"text":"It is a really good Indian vegetarian restaurant especially if ur in the mood for dosas. I would recommend the pau bhaji dosa it is amazing and unique and its not too spicy. The masala dosa is also good if you want a simpler choice. And if your not into anything spicy, get the cheese dosa. The service is nice and quick too."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Check out their weekend lunch buffets from 11am - 3pm I think? Waiters also come around special food items of the day during the buffet period. 

Food tastes authentic and mighty fresh. We're going back again this weekend! 

Even though the place gets packed the owners still figure out a way to fit you in. Now that's customer service."}
{"text":"One of the best South Indian places in Mississauga. Try the weekend buffet. You might have to wait a bit to be seated, but its worth the wait. Fresh food and OK service . Considering the price you pay, its a great option for a lazy Sunday brunch or any other day!!"}
{"text":"Went for a family lunch and we all were super impressed with the quality of the food.
Dosa was fabulous! There were about 8 of us and no one had a bad thing to say about their meals. Staff was great as well. You can park for free under the restaurant and give your plate number to the restaurant when you sit."}
{"text":"I usually pop in for a dosa, Udupi Madras is one of my favourites. It's not absolutely the greatest. The atmosphere is nice, and the selection is great, but there are some better options out there."}
{"text":"good, cozy, homely sort of place. the sambhar is lipsmacking. Love the food and family atmosphere.

Not a cheap place(hence 4 stars), but food is good."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the staff. We made reservations and had come with an infant - both of which were properly accommodated. We asked to be moved to a bigger table and without hesitation the waitress moved us over - mind you, the place was not busy when we went but still it was nice that she was able to give us a better table. 

I ordered the paneer masala dosa and it was amazing. Others at my table also loved their food. 

Downside was when we asked about a mango milkshake the waitress offered me a lasso (not the same thing). But when the other waitress was asked for a milkshake she actually knew what we wanted. Both still tasted great. 

Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent food but very stuffy place. Due to warm food being cooked lively, it's super hot here and you can't enjoy food. This is a continued issue since years."}
{"text":"Myself , my friends and my relatives have been visiting this place from past 9 years I can say the quality is improved a lot. I love their coconut and tomato chutney. 
Last week I visited, I had their Mysore garlic dosa ( blend of Mysore chutney and chilli garlic chutney ) topped with some secret spices and fresh cut Vegitables like onion tomato capsicum and cilantro. I can say it was ultimate heaven. 
Also don't forget to try Mirch masala  and  Kanchipuram Kara  for high spice tolerant like me. 
We tried their Paav bhaji and it was ready really amazing, I remembered Bombay and Juhu beach street food 
Oh ! Before I forget, I highly recommend you guys to try their Udupi special Gadbad ice cream. Really special 3-4 combination of ice cream. Madras coffee is the best."}
{"text":"We went to try masala puri but they don't serve it anymore, hence ordered bisi bele bath and set dosa.. I'm from Karnataka, so I know how these two should be and how it tastes.. It was nowhere close to set dosa or bisi bele bath, it tasted Like sambar rice, and no boondi but papad.. A big disappointment.."}
{"text":"When you're driving your kid to Mississauga so they can go to a birthday party at SkyZone and you're feeling like some decent indian look no further than Udupi Madras Cafe. Not only is it delicious and almost entirely vegan (there was only one dairy item) but it's also a buffet!"}
{"text":"So the boyfriend and I are sitting in our hotel hungry and freezing so we go on Yelp to find some food. I come across Dosa Palace and I'm like let's gooooo. So we find this hidden place on the second floor of some building and it's glowing and pretty and bright. Then we look at the menu and we look at each other and we're like...omg..where's the meat? Then we quickly glance around the restaurant deciding whether we should make a run for it because we're carnivores at heart. But we're in Toronto - where else can we go? We don't know where anything is and our GPS doesn't work. We order in scary anticipation as to what we're getting.

HOLY CRAP! The dosa was so good. Thank god we didn't leave. The potatoes, onions, other stuff, good stuff, amazing stuff inside the dosa - I inhaled all of it before I even knew what I was consuming. There was a lot of food. I was stuffed after eating anything and everything on the plate.

Just go here. I promise you won't be let down. I promise you'll want to make a 2 hour trip for it just like I will in the near future again. Hey! Shut down your computer and go already!"}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food, had been there for a buffet and liked most of the items. They have both south indian and north Indian choices."}
{"text":"This is my favourite South Indian place to go to with my family. The service is attentive and always smiling, the food is delicious and hot, and the wait staff is always happy to provide extra saamber and chutney at no extra cost! 

My favourite thing to get here are the masala dosas. The dosas are light and crispy, come with a generous amount of aloo and the chutneys and saamber are unlimited with each item ordered. If you have kids coming with you, make sure to order the Dollar Idlies. They are small dollar sized idlies that will be sure to be a hit."}
{"text":"When you have to wait for 1 hour to get 2 idlies, you think it cannot get worse. But the quality of food, bad hygiene, and rude staff makes it even worse. Hopeless place. Used to be one of the best, but is now a big disappointing."}
{"text":"Really good authentic South Indian dish served here at Udupi... Loved the food! I had dollar idly, onion rava chilli masala dosa and my hubby had sambar vada, Mysore masala dosa. 
It tasted very much like home food :) 

Suggestion: dollar idly could be served in a bigger bowl as it's difficult to fit your spoon and eat ! Other than that fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice. I have had lunch buffet in several south Indian restaurants across North America. This would probably fall in one of the best in terms of taste. Though the place is a bit crowded on weekends, the taste beats for the waiting time. I love the Golli Bajji! I am a Mangalorean and getting Golli Bajji in US/Canada is hard as finding water on moon! The bisibelebath is awesome! The chuttney never tasted stale, so my idli and vada went well them. In short, if you really want to taste some of the vegeterian south Indian food, go here, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay there's a reason I'm plummeting my review update down to 2-stars. Let me take you on my Sunday journey. 

We went in for dosas (rice crepe filled with potatoes or other fillings) since it had been what felt like ages since we got to devour some. Little did we know that Ala Carte dosas are not served on Sundays and only the buffet. I've slowly grown out of my liking for buffets and without too much fuss on my end, we decided to be open-minded about it and give the buffet a try. 

1 word plot thickner: TERRIBLE. 

Lesson learned: I will never sacrifice quality of food over price. Unfortunately, $11.99 doesn't get you too much in an all-you-can eat veggie buffet. The lines were insanely long and compact, and the food was below sub-par. Food was flying out in order to keep up with the demand but came out very low quality; everything just seemed tasteless and mushy. Not to mention, rules or standards were ignored. Example, asked if we could order from the ala carte menu before dining from the buffet, the response was no stating that they only served buffets during lunch hours on Sunday. Next thing I know our neighbors place 2  orders off the ala carte menu. Special treatment much? 

I've been going to Udupi for quite some time now, but I will say honestly that the idea of a Sunday buffet is more of an annoyance than enjoyment. From experience and being \"open\" to things, I'd recommended dining in on weekdays and weeknights to pick and choose dishes off their ala carte menu. 

Not too impressed with our recent dining experience; however,  I will go back to dine in for what Udupi IS good at!"}
{"text":"Great hot food. I would recommend.
1. Ghee Roasted Paper Masala Dosa 5/5
2. Rawa Chilli Masala 5/5
3. Sada Dosa 5/5
4. Pau Baaji 4/5
5 Madras Coffee:  horrible

Stop serving Madras coffee that is water based. Making American Coffee and then diluting with milk is why you didn't make it 5/5. You know how to make great food...Just learn to compliment with great beverages (that's your untapped market)."}
{"text":"Had been many times to this restaurant, the last one being on 19th May 2018. As always it serves authentic South Indian food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is probably my third visit and all of them have been before these apps came along. Secondly on the New Years Day at 11:30ish the group of us consisting of 27 of us including kids landed on this restaurant to have our brunch buffet. It became crowded after we started and people at UMC had set up and open a section for the additional crowd. 

Tons of choice for the all vegetarian South Indian cuisine buffet. Idlis, Medu Wadas, Dosas, Goli Bhajias (fritters), Upma, Pongal, Sheeera, Curd Rice, Sambhar, Rasam, Bisi Bele Bhath.... so much and more. 

Most of the dishes I tasted were done well. The dosas Crispy, the pooris freshly fried, the rices dishes well seasoned, the sambhar little thin for my taste, the rasam tangy and spicy at the same time. The channa Masala was a surprise-unlike the Punjabi version this tasted great with different spices and a good one not to miss. 

Idlis you should miss. Were too grainy and not soft. The coffee as well which is a marquee for any South Indian restaurant was a 0.5/5 stars. 

Would come back for sure if buffets were my thing."}
{"text":"First off, this is only my 2nd time having South Indian food. The last time I had it was like three years ago and to this day, I still don't know what I ate.  It was \"okay\".  

However, this place, the food was awesome!  I didn't know what I ordered, so I had to take pictures of the menu to see what it was called.  

Soup: Rasam - it had pineapples, onions and some other spices that I don't know.  Nice kick to it.  Really enjoyed it.  It tastes like a broth with a bit of tomato flavour, pineapples, onions and some hot peppers to it.   Served in a tin container. Kind of cool. 

Entree: Udupi special spring dosa: Thin crepe stuffed with spring onions, cabbage, bell pepper and with Hakka sauce. The crepe is so delicious.   Very fresh.  Oh, and it came with some dip or something...I dunno....but the think orange-ish one was absolutely amazing.  

As you can tell by my review, I had no idea what I was eating, but figured I would try it since it's a 2 minute walk from my house.  No regrets.

The one thing they could improve upon is service.  When we walked in (two Asians), they brought us water and the menu but never asked if we needed any help.  I had to wave them down and tell them \"we've never had this type of food before, so any recommendations?\" After we asked that, service was fine.  

I think the waiters/waitresses need to be more proactive here.

Otherwise, very new, interesting and good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian food! Service is great too. They have a large variety of dosas. Also, they have some North Indian options"}
{"text":"Good food! Good choice of dosas! 
Great madras coffee. 
I love the poori kurma!
Assorted appetizers comes with lots of different items. 
Idli bath is good!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary food. Nothing to write home about. None of the items was out of this world. Sambhar was OK. Chutney was bland. I always compare south Indian food to guru lukshmi. So this was disappointing. Would I go again. Probably not. If I'm spending my money I'm spending it on guru lukshmi."}
{"text":"Great South Indian Food. Gurulukshmi and Udupi compete head to head for the top spot for south indian food, Udupi wins in my opinion because of the moderate pricing and friendly service. 
P.S. The parking is free :)"}
{"text":"This place is one of the good south Indian places. I really liked the masala dosa. A bit spicy but thats what I was looking for. Good overall value."}
{"text":"Foodis really nice. Dosas variety and taste is good. They should improve on their service but its acceptable. Try it out if you love dosas or if you are a veggie."}
{"text":"Love south indian cuisine (vegetarian)

Great breakfast and wkd lunch buffet. Good decent choices. 

Free parking when you register your car. Customer service is pretty good.

Loved the thali, dosas are not better than Guru Lakshmi but still pretty good. 

Large amount of tables. 

Still more menu items to try."}
{"text":"I am a big Indian food fan.  I love northen Indian and dont have much experience with southern Indian.  This establishement is purely southern Indian.  I went looking for Butter Masala and none was to be had; so I had a spicy potato filled dosa.  I did not know how to eat it but I managed.  Very good.  It came with a coconut something er other and a really good soup.  I enjoyes it veey much.  At the time I was the only white customer.  That says a lot about the authenticity of the food.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good sit down Indian restaurant, this is a place to check out. 

I've been a few times now and the Poori Baagi is definitely my fave!! One portion comes with 2 pooris, a potato curry and one more white curry that tasted delicious. Poori is usually hit or miss because sometimes it can be super thick  and oily, but not here! Their poori was fresh, thin, and super crispy!

Atmosphere wise, it was decent. Definitely a family style restaurant as there were a lot of kids around. A little noisey, but still a great time.

The service was a bit slow as waiters kept passing us by as we tried to get their attention, but it wasn't the worst experience I've ever had. 

BTW, there's free parking below! It's in the underground portion, and shows a $5 fee, but if you're eating at Udupi, just sign your license plate at the front desk and you're good to go!

Overall, it was a good eat and if in the area, I'd go again."}
{"text":"We were here on Canada day with my family. We ordered Idli-Vada, Masala Dosa and Chola Batoora. After a 45 min wait our food arrived with a young manager (I'm guessing because he wasn't wearing the uniform worn by the servers) serving it to us. He only served the idli vada order, upon reminding him that we were waiting for the masala dosa he said \"do you want all the orders at the same time?\" (would he rather have only some of us eating on the table?)He then informed us that there was no more Chola Baturas for the day and instead we should order pooris because there is No difference. 

We just ordered Chola Batooras, if you dont serve them, just say we dont serve them right when the order is placed... not after a 45 min wait.

Anyways on to the quality and taste of the food. This restaurant offers below average south indian food, there are no lentils in the sambar its just mostly sambar masala in water, the Chatni is made with some dry coconut powder. Both items were truly below average in taste.The Dosa, idli-vadas were nothing special either. 

Overall Review 

Food-1/5
Service-0/5 
Ambience-1/5
Overall rating 2/5, still a pretty generous rating for this place."}
{"text":"We had these guys cater a party for us on November 3.  It was very cold out but they set up their stuff(table, chafing dishes, large griddle with gas tank) in the back yard and cooked up a storm for our guests.
We started with vadas, which were amazing!  Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with excellent coconut chutney and the orange chutney, as well as sambar.
The idlis (steamed rice cakes) were good....nice and soft......but some were cold maybe due to the weather?? 
The dosas were excellent. These were made fresh to order for each guest.  They had a variety of pastes (chili garlic, and 2 others) that were lathered onto the dosa while it cooked and then each person got to choose whatever toppings they wanted: potato mixture, onions, tomatoes, green chilis, cilantro, cheese, etc. They cooked 4 at a time and it took mere minutes to cook the dosas so people were not waiting long for their turn.  Plus they had the idlis and vadas to keep them busy until their turn for dosa.
They ended the meal with a very nice sweet dish.  It was like a halwa...with pineapple? in it.
Our guests enjoyed the food and we will definitely do another outdoor dosa party in the spring or summer so our guests don't have to go in and out of the house to get their food."}
{"text":"Its small south Indian cafe with good choices of south Indian dishes and good food. But the ambiance and service is horrible.
They need exhaust in kitchen, whole restaurant has very poor air circulation and stinks. By the time you finish your dinner and step out your cloths will stink too."}
{"text":"Came through during lunch on Sunday. Buffet was on. Decided to try it out nonetheless. 

The good, the vada and sambhar was not half bad at all. No where near Guru Laxmi's food but still. The lassi (thick yogurt drink) again was nicely thick and done nicely. 

The bad, bleh not worth the $14 for the buffet. Though I will give place the benefit of the doubt that the non buffet section is better as the other reviewers have stated. The idlis (steamed rice cake) hard and not good. Rasam pretty darn terrible. Stay away from the North Indian dishes (cottage cheese, chick pease etc). Saying they were dry, tasteless and weird would be nice. 

Will I go back? I truly don't know. I just might to check out what the good reviewers meant. I will say that stay away from the Sunday afternoon buffet."}
{"text":"I wish I knew about this place before! Its so yummy, doesnt smell at all compared to other south indian places that Ive been to and the prices cant be beat. 

I had the potato bondhas for an appetizer and the mysore masala dosa for a main.......both were awesome! The lassi wasnt up to par, but I dont like mine as think as others do. They had lots of variety in dosas as well.  The service was quick and nice and the restaurant was clean. I would definitely introduce it to others as a nice place to eat. 

There is a free parking garage downstairs which was a big plus!!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Indian food ain't bad! I'm not a vegan, granola type guy but needed a somewhat healthy meal after being away on business for several days. I was hoping for something spicy and order as such, but I guess they didn't believe me (white guy). It did the trick."}
{"text":"I have wanted to visit this restaurant for ages! It is across the street from my work and I kept thinking of going but cheaping out. Well, my last day at this job came up and I knew it was now or .... Another time, lol. 
First off, decor is tired but and sort of cheap looking but I'm fine wth that as long as the food is good! We had to wait a bit to be seated. The server was in the back and didn't know we were there. Didn't know what gluten free meant, but I know what dosa's are made from so I took a leap of faith (a delicious leap of faith). 
I ordered the cheese masala dosa and omg was it ever good! Just the right amount of cheese, the dosa was crispy and tasted amazing! The potatoes and onions in the middle were great (though I think I would have been so happy with the cheese I wouldn't have missed the potatoes, haha). 
So so good!!
Prices are pretty reasonable for a nice, filling lunch. Around $10 for a dosa. 
Yum yum yum! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4-star for the DOSA because that is all I ever order when I go here. The Dosas here are delicious. I have been coming here for quite some time now and enjoy myself every time. The appetizers are also very tasty. The Dosa and Uttapam are what I enjoy most and the different flavors that they offer for each are amazing. The staff are friendly. The restaurant itself has free parking right under the restaurant. The restaurant is clean and not very large in which case it does get busy on the weekends around dinner time. But you can still find a seat. All of the food is South-Asian and vegetarian which is another thing I like because you know there won't be any contamination for vegetarians. 

Definitely a must-try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Udupi is a restaurant that I never seem to go to anymore since I now associate with times when I have no car available. This is because it used to be my go-to place during the days I didn't own a car and couldn't travel far to eat. Therefore, it's been pretty long since I last visited and now have a lot of restaurants to which I can compare the food to. 
Now that I have tried several south indian restaurants, whereby Guru Lakshmi is my favourite, I tend to compare all of them to the best I've had. 
I finally decided to eat at Udupi again and nothing had changed since I last visited, from the decor to the menu options and also the level of crowd, which as before, was never busy but never empty either. 
Their menu does have quite a variety of dosa options, although not as many as as unique as Guru Lakshmi's. 
I ordered the idli to share and then the Mysore dosa. My brother got the Chole bhatura. The food arrived within 5-10 minutes. The idli was smaller than the kind you would get at Guru Lakshmi, but softer. So, wasn't better or worse.
My dosa was served just the way I like it, not too soft and not too crispy. They also put less oil as instructed. The bhatura was the best I've seen in the GTA, since they were actually thick, puffy and huge, unlike the ones we got at Saravanna Bhnavan, which were super thin, greasy, and which deflated immediately. My brother loved his food and actually wondered why we don't come here more often. I enjoyed mine too. When in comes to the taste, I would say that the dosas' taste as good as Guru Lakshmi's. The only reason Guru Lakshmi still is number one for me is because of their variety of dosa's and the presentation.
When in comes to the service, it wasn't super friendly and attentive, but no one was rude either. Also, prices were pretty reasonable.
Most probably my second favourite south indian restaurant in the GTA so far."}
{"text":"Soooooo I really built this place up and had it on my list of must go to places. This review is based solely on the weekend breakfast buffet in comparison to Anjappar Chettinad and Saravana Bhavan. 

To start off with, the service here is horrible:
As an example, there was one waiter and one person behind the counter. There were no plates upon our arrival and we had to search for the waiter who was in the kitchen for quite a while. Unlike, Anjappar, this place does not have free coffee and it had to be ordered separately. The waiter sent us to the person behind the counter and that person asked us to ask the waiter. When we explained to her that it was him who had sent us - she huffed and took the coffee order. This costs extra! 

The food was ok - we definitely preferred the puris and the dosas but the sambhar, potato bhaji and Rava kesari were quite bad. This is definitely not a place we will be returning to."}
{"text":"Udupi  is known for  its South Indian Cuisine .  I have gone a la carte and done the buffet . I prefer a la carte and recommend you  go with that  as well If you go a la carte I  recommend the Dosas  mainly paper masala dosa. Their lunch buffet is fresh but too carbohydrate heavy and sadly exclusively vegetarian . Perhaps adding meat to the buffet would  result in more customers. I find myself only having Dosa and the random soup  textured dishes or the vegetables.  While there is other items like rice, pongal, sheera, it is  an excessive amount of carbs  when one carb available like dosa will be fine. I will always return but only for Dosas off the menu and will have the buffet if meat items get added .  Make sure you try the dosas here , and ask for no  ghee  because it feels much healthier this way . .
The service is really good with attentive servers who give a good and authentic experience ."}
{"text":"Great food nice decor but let down by extremely poor service. I would give it 5 star if they can improve the service. We ordered butter garlic dosa,chilli garlic dosa both were good.Sambhar and coconut chutney were great. I wish to go back there for food but until they improve the service standards I am not going back. How do they expect us to eat sambhar without a spoon, we had to ask for one. We asked for drinks menu which never arrived. There is no concept of tracking orders, orders were taken for customers who came after us while we were waiting for someone to take an order.If it wouldn't have been food I would have rated it 1 Star"}
{"text":"Loved the freshness and authenticity. Also the ambience has got an amazing Indian feel to it. Taste wise its awesome. And parking is convenient. We ordered roast ghee masala dosas and tasted great. The service was prompt and we left the place very happy. Will be back for more and soon."}
{"text":"Was expecting excellent food and pulled in 6 of us but was dissatisfied 
. Iddli felt frozen and defrosted rather than fresh batter
. Dosa was made from yeast, not naturally fermented
- chatni was made from dried coconut, not fresh

Last but most importantly, the quality of a restaurant is measured by the cleanliness of its restrooms. Don't store table cleaning sprays under the sink in the restroom !"}
