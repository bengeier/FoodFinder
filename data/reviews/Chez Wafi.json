{"text":"Really yummy!! Great service! Very hospitable! Good prices! The person working there (manager? Or not?) was very nice! I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Wafi goes back to the 1980s where the family owned and operated Patisserie Arlekin stays as a shiny star in the humble city of Tripoli Lebanon, now the years of experience come to present us with the best authentic Lebanese dish."}
{"text":"Excellent everything!  The owner (Wafi) is very welcoming. His quality of service is surpassed by the quality of the food. Even the tea is a home blend and it's excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing new place....delicious traditional Lebanese kaak filled with the traditional Zaatar as well as a variety of cheeses, meats and sweets...super friendly owner..highly recommended"}
{"text":"This was honestly one of my best eating experiences I have ever had. I could tote all the wonderful ways this place is amazing, or you could go yourself and know that you are family and welcome the second you walk through their doors. If you know nothing about the food, they will walk you through it all suggesting things that others usually get or are traditional in toppings plus you can just choose your own and just be you and be accepted. The coffee is an amazing compliment to the bread and the light toppings that sing to our taste buds. Go here. Don't walk, run, they are worth your every moment and I for one will be back every chance I get."}
{"text":"We went there for weekend breakfast, really liked the food, the service was very nice and hospitable as expected from lebanese owner :)"}

{"text":"Chez wafi is a new Lebanease concept of fast but healthy food but it is a traditional concept in Lebanon. The store opened few month ago & offers a variety of flavours in the same bread called \"kaaek\". The owner is very welcoming, the ingredients used are good quality. Everything from salty to sweet dishes every single dish is delicious. It's really worth the stop. The ambiance is great, service is awesome, it's really a gem to be discovered."}
{"text":"Great food served by a friendly staff. The owner (Wafi) takes great pride in his product and his customer service, truly a friendly face.   The kaaek is as good or better than any I've eaten in Lebanon, and the ingredients he offers as toppings are all fresh. The whole store projects a clean, professional atmosphere. This will definitely be my new go-to place when I need a taste of the Middle East!"}
