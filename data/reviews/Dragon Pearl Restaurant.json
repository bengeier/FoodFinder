{"text":"We ordered from here last night for my brother's birthday. He really wanted Chinese food but we couldn't go to the place he wanted because he had lots of school work to finish. So I ordered our meal to be delivered from Dragon Pearl instead after reading the Yelp reviews.  I was happy that they did deliver since not many places do now however it took them almost 2 hours to bring our order and I phoned right when they opened at 5 pm. I was not pleased it was almost 7 pm before our meal arrived and we were all very hungry by this point. I don't even live very far but I had already changed into my sleep wear after my long day of work and did not feel like driving anywhere.   When we ate our food I have to say I've had better and much cheaper. The ginger beef didn't have that kick we were looking for and the fried rice was surprisingly bland. The Wor Won Ton soup was very good however the broth wasn't salty like most broths are and there was a nice helping of vegetables in there as well. I was however impressed by the dumplings most places they are dry and very heavy and you feel like you swallowed a ball of rubber but these were very good we finished off the order in no time.   I would for sure stop in and eat the won ton soup or the dumplings any day because they were really good. However the food didn't wow me. I felt like some of the dishes were missing something. I also found the cost a bit much for me. Normally we pay about $55 with tax and tip when we order else where here we paid $70 including our $9 delivery fee and tip."}
{"text":"This is our favourite place to go for chinese food - it's pricey, but as far as chinese goes it's better than a lot of places we've been. Rarely tough, usually fair on quantity, and always good service."}
{"text":"Ate salt pepper squid, potstickers ginger beef...  All pretty good given that calgary isn't a chinese food Mecca. Will recommend to people craving for decent chinese food in calgary. One bonus, pretty clean dishes and silverware"}
{"text":"I am fortunate enough to work in Inglewood so I can enjoy the Dragon Pearl for lunch anytime I like. The owners are lovely! They are always smiling and friendly. The Dragon Pearl has a fantastic lunch special. The portion is a fair size...enough for 2 lunches actually! I LOVE the Szechuan Beef! It's not that sticky, sweet mess you get in dingy food courts. The beef is so incredible tender and the vegetables are always perfectly cooked. Just the right amount of crunch from the broccoli... Yum! They also have a delicious Wor Wonton soup. Perfect for those chilly fall days."}
{"text":"Love Dragon Pearl. We moved to the neighbourhood 3 years ago and was hoping that this local Chinese resto would be our go to place for takeaway & sit in. We were not disappointed!! The quality of food is always excellent and the food is very fresh and piping hot. We get a takeaway from here at least once or twice a month and it is always great. The service is friendly and they genuinely care that your needs a met. Would recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"I love the Pan Fried Dumplings. They are made with a Rice Wrap instead of using Wheat. Everything I have ever eaten there has been delicious and trust me it is worth the drive..."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 25 years! We used to road-trip from Red Deer back in the days when bars were closed on Sundays, so we had the day off. I have introduced so many to this place, never a negative response. My Aunt even took Ginger Beef on the plane back to Ontario, she was so impressed! Love to go with a group, so we can order many dishes. Favorites: Ginger beef, salt and pepper squid, chow mein delight, hot/sour soup, fried dumplings.... On and on"}
{"text":"So this is my 100th review and my first in well over a year. I've heard great things about this restaurant. People have told me that it's the best in the city.   I just ordered my first take-out order from Dragon Pearl, and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed. The dumplings seem to be their specialty but I found them to be a bit too doughy for my liking. People raved about their salt and pepper squid, but mine was over-cooked and the batter to has too much egg and not enough crisp. I carried that container of squid for (maybe) two minutes before I ate it, so it's not because it  was sitting in a closed container for too long.  I'll continue to order food from Dragon Pearl to see if I like it any better, but I'm going to order my salt and pepper squid somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that no self respecting Yelper has found this little Chinese gem in Inglewood. It's a small, cosy, friendly, family run business, that has been a round along time, surviving the highs and lows of Calgary.   I tend to be a little cynical about ethnic eateries in North America, as the exciting, intense, bold and spicy flavours tend to be reduced down to levels of boring blandness, for the undiscerning masses weaned on ketchup and salt. This joint is different and you feel it the moment you walk in. You are politely greeted, politely seated, and proudly served. The owners reflect the Asian courtesy and honour always afforded to their guests. A rare experience in many  North American establishments.   The menu is fabulous with both Szechuan and Mandarin style dishes and the food is exceptional. From the fresh pan fried dumplings ( I don't like steamed anything; preferring the unhealthy fried options) to one of my very favourite starters, the salt and pepper squid, which evaporates in your mouth, (Okay, I'll concede it gets close to melting in your mouth) followed by spicy Szechuan Ginger Fried Beef....and sampling all the other dishes ordered by my companions around the table. One is forced to conclude, that exceptional food, prepared lovingly and humbly in honour of you the guest, makes living and dining out , one of the most pleasurable and wonderful experiences.   I urge you to try this place. It's incredibly good. The prices are inconceivably reasonable and it's embarrasing to pay as little as we do for something as extraordinary as this in Calgary."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out yesterday.  The dumplings were flavourless, the ginger beef had a very odd taste, and the eight precious jewels were just okay.  On a positive note, the vegetarian spring rolls were excellent.  All-in-all a very disappointing meal.   Too bad - I remember when this was an excellent restaurant.  I don't know what's happened to this Inglewood classic?"}
{"text":"I have always eaten in the restaurant. I've been happy with it. The only thing I don't care for is the plum sauce, but I think that's just me, nothing wrong with it. I think I'm just used to the sugary fake stuff other restaurants use and theirs is probably real. They bring everything out hot and sizzling. The pan fried wontons are the best. I could just eat those as my whole dinner. Actually, I think I did once a couple years ago."}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl was the first Chinese food restaurant I ate at in Calgary. Eight years later, it is still one of my favorites. Quick, friendly service and fresh, delicious food makes it our family's go to choice for dining in or take out.   Try the specials, they are delicious. Also salt & pepper squid is a must. My son (5) eats his body weight in Ginger Beef while saying \"that is spicy\" the whole time."}
{"text":"Honestly. At best, food court quality. We ordered delivery, nice staff, quick, but all six of us were disappointed. It must have changed ownership since I visited last. Many better to choose from. Sorry to be negative. Hot and Sour soup was good. B"}
{"text":"Dragon Pearl in hands down the best Chinese food in the city, with huge portions. The CASHEW CHICKEN  is a must have when ordering from here. Dine in or take out are both great! I have looked up the heath code inspections and it is confirm they run a clean kitchen which is more than I can say for lots of Chinese food restaurants."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. Apparently the chef has changed and its completely different than it used to be. Ginger beef doesn't taste even remotely like ginger or beef, almond chicken wasn't crispy and it was all just generally not good. Waste of money in my opinion"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Consistantly good with friendly service.  I go about once a month and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the hot and sour soup, a small order would do 4 people  Also tried the special chow mein, skinny noodles with cabbage, chicken, pork and shrimp  Kinda bland on both accounts I was hoping for more"}
{"text":"I would give 2 stars but taking the Calgary factor into account (not many Chinese restaurants compared to Toronto)  I got the takeout option, Shanghai Fried Noodles. It was soggy, kind of bland, minimal meat, and overall meh. Upside is takeout is fast (I got it 30 seconds after ordering)  I would NOT recommend unless you really wanted Chinese food and didn't have a lot of time to spare."}
{"text":"For the price you get a good sized serving and it always comes pipping hot and fresh when we get it delivered. For chinese food I'd say this place is average. I'm a huge fan of soups and I think their hot and sour is ok but I really don't like the won ton. They have a reasonable selection to choose from. I like the Mu Shu. Make sure to order some extra pancakes as the Mu Shu is plentiful and more than the pancakes you get."}
{"text":"Wow. Lot's of positive reviews here. That's funny because this is the worst food I've had in a long time. Slimy mushrooms on the pork made me gag. The ginger beef was unchewable. The dumplings were half filled with oil. The fried rice was burnt and crunchy. They give you lots of food but we threw out most of it. Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"When it's nice and clean, with good food and service, that's worth a return, like this one.    Figure i'm just a tourist here, but this Inglewood seems like a nice part of town.  anyways, ordered the pan fried dumplings, not only was it's nice, big and juicy, but the nice crispy texture from every bite.  crunchy skin yet soft as dough.  quite busy during lunch."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom nom! That's what my tummy was saying after lunch today. I'm pretty sure it'll say the same thing when I did into the leftovers of my lunch combo later this evening.  Dragon Pearl's been in Inglewood for ages. Seriously! Word is Ian's pushing 30 years in the neighbours. If you've walked passed it in the past, stop in for a bite next time your in the 'hood instead of going on by.  The interior is modestly decorated, dark red-ish walls and paintings to match, two large circular tables, and then perhaps a dozen more smaller settings. The tables are each set with a bowl, plate and chopsticks. No cutlery here right off the bat, although my server asked me if chopsticks were fine or if I'd prefer to have a fork.  I came in for a late lunch and was greeted and immediately seated (as tends to happen with late lunches). My server was as friendly as genuine as they come. Dragon Pearl's got a variety of lunch combinations, all are served with rice and your choice of won ton soup or a spring roll for $9.50. I ordered the chicken cashew dish with a spring roll and a pot of jasmine tea. I love that my whole pot of tea was only $1!  My rice came in its own rice thermos, and the chicken cashew dish was big enough that two people could've easily shared it. The spring roll was fresh with a nice crunch to it when I bit in.  Yummy food, more than decent prices... you might just make a regular out of me Dragon Pearl."}
{"text":"I have not eaten Chinese food for years... then was additionally put off by a recent unhappy experience at another small Chinese restaurant in town that was disappointing in every way. (May write a scathing review of it, when I have simmered down). So... to have such a delicious meal here was very restoring. Nice fresh ingredients, freshly and rapidly prepared. Best Chinese food that I have had in years."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with high hopes given the yelp reviews I read. Left very disappointed. The dishes prepared are not aligned with authentic Chinese dishes that I'm used to eating. The dishes are drenched in soy sauce and all taste very similar. My moms dishes are better than these! The restaurant was completely full when we came in though, so perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes. All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic, traditional Chinese."}
