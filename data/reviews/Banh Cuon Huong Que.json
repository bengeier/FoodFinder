{"text":"Nice, clean decor but mediocre pho. When we entered the resto we were greeted and seated immediately. Worth noting it was around 130 pm which I thought was still around lunchtime. However, there was no other customers inside.   Ordered pho with well done beef and the meat was cut in thick slices and was hard to chew. Also this is a cash only place yet it does not quite reflect in the price. I felt like I was paying for the cleaner decor and friendly service (which of course, is still very important when it comes to dining experience) but not so much for the food.   Safe to say I am not coming back soon. If I am to return maybe I would try their banh cuon (specialty?)"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me for their chicken pho by my sister. The establishment itself is located in an unassuming plaza... I wouldn't have noticed if it weren't for my sister and I drive pass this restaurant almost daily.   I ordered chicken pho with rare beef and beef balls. There is only one size for the chicken pho (in between a medium and large). The portion was really big for me and they were very generous with the meat. The broth had a milder taste compared to typical beef broth, and it wasn't salty, which is good. This dish is $9, which I feel is well worth the price.   The specialty here is actually banh cuon so that's what I'll try next!"}
{"text":"We went there today on 13 April 2018.  Today happened to be a Friday the 13th too, so I guess our luck ran out.  We ordered a bowl of the rare beef pho and a bowl of beef pho.  They weren't all that bad but the rare beef was very tough.  The server wasn't all that friendly, but the place was respectable."}
{"text":"Easily the cleanest Viet resto in the area. The banh cuon was great. Service was also above average!"}
{"text":"I came here one day after order their speciality banh cuong to my surprise They microwave the rolls it was overheat when u pick it up with chopsticks it break apart.maybe their food is not fresh they need to use microwave to serve to us. Sad"}
{"text":"Best place to go for banh cuon in jane and sheppard if youre in the area (rice noodle roll wrapped around vietnamese minced pork with sweet fish sauce) We got the Banh Cuon Dac biet (house special variety)   For $10 it was a very filling and delicious meal ! And the server was really cute and friendly too"}
{"text":"Came here several times before under old management and this new one. Their specialty Banh Cuon is good but not consistent so is the pho. We have been there several times and food tasted different each time. Wished there was consistency, would make it a lot better than their counterparts. Some days better than others. Service is better than the others along jane street."}
