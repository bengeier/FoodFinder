{"text":"Look, I don't have a problem with the concept. Bring on the fun and sexy girls in lingerie. I'll eat crappy food, I'll put up with bad service, I probably won't even notice the dirty restaurant. But if that's your thing, if fun and sexy girls are your gimmick, you better make damn sure your girls are fun and sexy. Which the girls at Fantasy Grill are not. So what have you got when you remove fun and sexy girls from the equation? Crappy food, bad service and a dirty restaurant. F'in gross, man. Stay away."}
{"text":"The \"F.G.\" has apparently closed down... For good. I can't help but feel a little bit bad. I really did want to see it make the \"full transformation.\" But maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Ah well."}
{"text":"What genius came up with this idea? Let's see, what would be a great idea for a new sports bar/ restaurant. Hmm how bout have chicks in corsets and lingerie serve the food and dance. I'm a member of lunch club and was sent a 50% off coupon for this place..Called a few friends and we all met there for lunch. I had no idea what to expect, but women walking around in lingerie at noon was not it. In addition (no offense) the girls were not attractive.. I would have paid them to put more clothes on.. It was like seeing the D dancers, only in broad daylight and I wasn't drunk, I was clad in my corporate attire on my lunch break. Weird. The food was horrible, really horrible, but I don't suppose many people are going for the food. The chicks couldn't even get in to the \"fantasy\" they were supposed to be creating. At one point a girl hopped up on  table and began hula hooping with the most bored expression on her face.. And she couldn't hula hoop either so her show lasted about 7 seconds. Lame."}
