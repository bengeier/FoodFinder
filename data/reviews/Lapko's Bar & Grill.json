{"text":"Good  people.  They have fair prices and they have a good  jukebox.  It's probably the most chill place in town."}
{"text":"My favorite part about Allegheny County isn't the big chain locations and fancy brand new spots (though I'll try anything once), but it's the places that give us our unique something from nothing flavor not found nowhere else and Lapko's, is one of those locations that lives up to that.  If Cheers was still on the air this is what it would be like.  Original Tin ceiling, vintage memorabilia, old school charm looking to add in some new school style.  A pool table and to my surprise one of those table top bowling games (this is the place for some great Instagram pics).  I didn't eat but they serve food also, probably next time.  If 8th and the Water Front continue to dedicate itself to revitalization I believe this place could survive long through another era of A homestead boom.  I could kinda see Homestead creating its own SouthSide esque.  If you are fresh in town, looking for somewhere new to add to your untapped account, or always stay here yet never been, I'd suggest giving this place a visit."}
{"text":"It's not the sleaziest bar in Homestead but with a few tweaks it could be.  I'm only here because I'm trying to get that Soused Badge and wanted to make sure I earned it properly.  I'll be nice and stop my review here...  Got a shot of Absolute and moved on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for cheap drinks before the Blackberry Smoke concert.  This bar, I think epitomizes an old Pittsburgh steel town dive.  You can practically feel the steel mills chugging away when you enter.  Old men drinking cans of PBR and Natty Ice.  They class it up a bit by pouring it into Iron City pint glasses, though. Why pay $4 - $6 for a pint at the Waterfront when you can get a Budweiser draft here for $2.50.  Looking for a cheap dive in Homestead?  Your search ends here."}
