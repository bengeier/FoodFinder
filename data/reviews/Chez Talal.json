{"text":"Authentic Lebanese food is often hard to find outside of Toronto, but as a Newmarket resident I'll need to look no further.

This place is clean, family-friendly and the smell of flame-cooked meats on a spit is certainly welcoming. Salads look and taste very fresh. A short chat with the owner revealed that he has a strong passion for cooking and has fine-tuned a number of authentic recipes over the years, and it shows. The food speaks for itself. I would highly reccommend their chicken shawarma, one of the best I've tasted.

Overall a very satisfying experience and will certainly visit again!"}
{"text":"Had their chicken shawarma for the first time today. ..chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned....fresh hummus and veggies
All around best shawarma in town .
Will definitely be back for more food..looking forward to trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff...great food. Supreme veggie (with chicken) is an amazing low carb option. Tastes great. Got second one  take out for dinner ."}
{"text":"The food is good,  but the service is terrible. If you go there to eat,  expect to wait half an hour minimum for your food."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb shawarma.  Rivals those in Toronto.

The cauliflower shawarma is a must try. Butter soft cauliflower crisped up on a flat top.  They then add their delicious fries for added meaty texture which you can then dress up with toppings of your choice.

Talal himself is a gracious host.  With everything prepared fresh and the feeling like you're family here, this is an absolute must tl visit."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my mom and my sister we all ordered the falafel wrap. Fresh homemade falafels made to order. We also each got a sample of falafel which was really nice. Wraps were all super filling and all the toppings were super fresh. Great customer service the owner was a super friendly, genuine and nice. Prices reasonable. Will definitely  be going back."}
{"text":"second time here and the food was good. I called in advanced to order my food so I could just pick it up. I arrived and my order wasn't ready. the girl working there was just chit chatting with another person. had to wait for 15 mins. she kept saying it'll be ready in 2 mins and she kept chatting away. I asked for not spicy but found hot peppers in my food?!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my mom. I live downtown but come to Newmarket to hang out with my mom once a week. I'm a vegan and it's tough to find a place that my mom and I both like around here as she's super picky about her food. I was so impressed with how much care the owner put into preparing my vegan meal! He made sure to use utensils that hadn't touched any animal products when preparing my plate, I didn't even have to ask! Very good food - everything is fresh and homemade -and amazing customer service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am currently doing a Shawarma Tour of the GTA. This place is one of my favourites. Huge portions!!! Amazing Flavour!!! Super Friendly Staff!!! Good Price. 

The Chicken Shawarma sandwich is Deeeee-lish!!! I will be back to try the Beef.... and maybe a Babaganoush."}
{"text":"I liked very much the Falafel sandwich, really well done!
Serving customers should be a little faster."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week, the food is beyond amazing it's worth the price! I always get the chicken shwarma dinner I can eat alot and this dinner fills me right up! The best part about this place is the environment inside the owners are so friendly and nice that it really makes your trip in even more worth while!"}
{"text":"Tried a chicken/beef mixed shawarma with extra hummus, garlic, pickles and hot sauce, it was delicious!  Talal is a friendly guy who opened a bantered where he joked about charging me $100 for this topping and a $1000 for that, but in the end the delicious sandwich was a very reasonable $5.99. 

I would recommend Talal's restaurant because of the fresh made food and himself, who takes pride in his shop and the product!"}
{"text":"We just noticed this place as we were driving along Davis Dr.  It is great to have another place in town for shawarma.  Since my husband and I have been here 3 times in a week I would say it is a winner.  The owner, Talal is so proud of his food which he makes from scratch and it shows because everything is delicious.  We have already tried the okra bel zeit and the fava moutabal along with chicken shawarma sandwich and the fattoush salad.  Also the girl who works the cash is so sweet and polite."}
{"text":"Super nice guy, very polite and the food is awesome. Finally. Shawarma in Newmarket"}
{"text":"I've had falafel at many different places but the falafel at chez talal is by far the best I've ever tasted it was full of great flavour. aside from the amazing food the staff working were very friendly and welcoming and the restaurant was very clean. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Nothing but the best service every time and the food is delicious!! Everything is made fresh in store daily! I love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Best Arabic food ever!!! I love this place! You have to give this place a try. Great food, great service and nice atmosphere. We came here with my boyfriend and his family who are Arabic. We came all the way from Scarborough. I have tried many Arabic restaurants trying to get some good authentic food. We tried mostly everything on the menu and it was all so so delicious, fresh and full of flavours. And I would 1000% recommend this place to anybody. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and made fresh right in front of you. Many options, and very large portions. Highly recommend the falafel which is fried fresh to order. The owner is incredibly nice and friendly. He lets you try the food first before serving it to you to make sure you like what you are getting. We had an amazing experience and will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for authentic Mediterranean Cuisine. Fair prices and outstanding fresh food. Very nice, local family business. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great small restaurant 
Delicious Lebanese food
Owners very nice & generous with good sense of hospitality 
We tried warak Enab, falafel& a mixed grill platter"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma plate in all Richmond Hill, Aurora and Newmarket Area. Tried it myself today and loved it. Will be coming back this week."}
{"text":"My favourite place for shawarma!!! Talal is a very nice man and works very hard. Always gives a generous portion and inexpensive. Everyone is friendly , food is great , prices are great. What more could you ask for ? I come here all the time. Keep it up Chez Talal!"}
{"text":"So good! The staff are super friendly and generous! We got 3 shwarma dinner plates, mixed beef and chicken. Got extra garlic and hot sauce on top! The hot sauce is actually hot and is absolutely delicious!  The owner had samples out for the expanding menu. We are from out of town but we will definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly family-run place with large portions and fresh food. Quick service as well. Would definitely come back! We had the chicken shawarma dinner with a side of falafels and it was enough for 2 adults and 1 toddler for lunch!"}
{"text":"Given the length of time that Davis drive has been a war zone as they have made accommodations for the new bus lanes there is no way that Chez Talal should be as popular as it is - I mean you couldn't access the businesses for over a year. 

Yet here they are, a ring stand alone shop in the same parking lot as a host of run down businesses (and a drug/alcohol rehab clinic) rocking solid star rating with higher than normal numbers of photos and reviews for the Newmarket area. 

Baffled and curious was I? Yep. So I pulled in. 

It's a small footprint, set up like most shops of its kind. A. Counter you walk up to and order backed with meat on spits and a grill. I'm fairly fluent in Lebanese cuisine but I asked anyway what they recommended. Without wavering the owner piped up from the back - \"Try our chicken shawarma. And once you're addicted, you come back and try everything elae\". Sold. 

And goddamned it. He was right. One of the freshest, most succulent, and moist. Chicken shawarma I've had sincey days living in the \"little lebanon\" area of downtown Windsor. A place where every business owners tells you that their shawarma \"iz beast\". And to their credit theyre all right somehow. 

Amazing food and best of all no nasty after math which I tend to get from shawarma (heart burn, burping. Etc)

Everything made here is fresh made daily, hormone and preservative free so you can be confident thatbyiure getting a great meal. 

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly, the food is so-so.  I've been a couple times and the same each time.  It's okay in a pinch, but there are better choices."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food!  Nice to have this restaurant in Newmarket!  Tabbouleh is made fresh to order!!"}
{"text":"You must try everything on the menu at least once! I recommend the veggie supreme - a salad with any meat or falafel you like on top. The tabouli is a must as well! Fresh food not fast food!!!!"}
{"text":"Was very unimpressed, had the chicken Shawarma plate, the salad had no dressing on it, just shredded lettuce, some mashed up tomatoes and a couple hot peppers and pickles.  

Chicken came out of a tin can , dry as can be. I don't know why alot of Shawarma places resort to this. If it's not right off the spit you are wasting your time. 

Hummus and garlic was nothing special and hot sauce was flavourless and not even that spicy at all. 

Overall pretty bland."}
{"text":"Most amazing and friendly staff! Currently sitting on the patio a Mediterranean chicken shawarma panini while my boyfriend enjoys his hamburger and some delicious sweet peas and rice. So happy and im going to bring everyone i know here!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat . Not too crazy about  and drink is not included 
But their shawarma is amazing very clean , good service, very fresh"}
{"text":"Get extra hot sauce!!! Friendly owner, falafels are made fresh. Garlic potatoes took it to a new level."}
{"text":"This was my family's first time ordering form here and the food was delicious and such a nice change from your regular pizza/burger takeout. I ordered a chicken shawarma dinner with rice and it was so so good. The garlic sauce is everything, and the hot sauce is so spicy (which I could never say no to - it has such a good burn to it!) The meal comes with tons of chicken and rice, pickled veggies, a pita and hummus. It's delicious on its own or all mixed together with the pita. So much food in one portion that we all had left overs. Will definitely be back when I'm craving something different! 

ALSO! 

The owner was so so very kind. He chatted with me the whole time and asked about my Christmas/New Year plans. He seems like such a lovely man, and made the whole experience that much better!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for food that is both healthy and delicious... You better stop at Chez Talal.. The ocra stew, chicken shawarma, followed by Green Capsicum Dolmethes is heavenly.."}
{"text":"Delicious food! It is a little pricey but you get SO much so it's worth it. The only thing is that it takes a very long time to order...but you can't fault a business for being busy, right?"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My husband and I got chicken schwarmas and they were super tasty. Will absolutely be going back. Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to chez talal. It was fast and the food was delicious!!! I highly recommend the hummus, garlic sauce and fries. I ordered the shawarma dinner and the portion size was huge!!! It came with rice and a ton of sides. The staff are super friendly and offered me a coffee to enjoy after my meal was done. The food is fresh and all the items served are delicious. It is a great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I keep trying places that have shwarma because I've been hunting for ones IN Newmarket, rather then having to head to Aurora or Richmond Hill to get the kind of quality that I expect from good ones.

*sigh* Nothing special here.... some of the items ono the menu such as these garlic potatoes I wanted to try were not even available. The seasoning on both the chicken and the beef wasn't very full of flavor, the hummus,  garlic puree, and tahini sauces were kind of meh.

May as well keep driving to Aurora."}
{"text":"Located just a few minutes from Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket is Chez Talal. Chez Talal is a great place to get delicious shawarma at a good price. The owner here seems very nice and is quite talkative with his customers. 

I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap ($7). The ingredients were fresh and the food was delicious. I would love to order the chicken shawarma dinner the next time I'm here since it includes a pita and a drink for just $10. Or maybe I would try the falafel. Either way I'll be returning next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Lovely and friendly service, just you feel like Talal's personal gust at his home. 
We ordered Tabouleh, Kafta and Shesh Taouk, and Lebanese traditional stuffed grape leafs.
Extremely delicious, we tasted freshly fried Falafel the only crispy falafel i know in the GTA.
The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner and staff. Food is great. Had the chicken Sharma and the falafel. Would come back."}
{"text":"Being Lebanese myself, its very hard to find authentic and GOOD tasting Mediterranean food, especially Lebanese. I stopped by and grabbed one chicken shawarma sandwich along with one falafel sandwich (I was hungry). The first thing I noticed was how much the owners reminded me of my own parents. This is literally a \"mom and pops\" shop, as real as it gets. 

The chicken shawarma was one of the BEST I've had. Flavourful, juicy, clean cut chicken, and you can tell the veggies were fresh, and not in the fridge from the day before. The garlic shawarma sauce was heavenly. Make sure you ask for a bit extra, I like to get one on the side for dipping. (Id also recommend asking for a few fries on the shawarma, that's how its done in Lebanon)

As for the Falafel, this was my major concern. Ive tried Falafel in over 10 restaurants and it was a shame to see how poorly made it was each time. Ive had it all from microwaved and soggy, to fried and undercooked. I was AMAZED by how delicious the falafel was! I found out after complimenting the owner that he is famous for his Falafel. It was perfectly crispy, cooked all the way through, and is literally the best falafel I have ever had. 

I look forward to going back to Chez Talal with my family and friends just to show them what real, good Lebanese food tastes like!

Thank you for your AMAZING food and service!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!! I had the fattoush salad and falafel wrap and both were very good...especially the salad. Even though it was not busy, the food preparation was slow but I think that's because everything is made fresh. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner, food tasted great but the only complaint is that I found a piece of plastic in my food.  You can imagine what might've happened it I hadn't found it and swallowed it.... still very delicious food and I'd come back ;)"}
{"text":"The shawarma was good by my dish was mostly fries and not meat which was very disappointing.
He hummus was not tasty and very sour.

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So good. The prices are very fair, and friendly service. Will definitely return, can't wait to explore the menu. Today I enjoyed the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Outstanding! You can put a lot of credence into a Lebanese restaurant by how well they do Falafel, and these guys do it awesome! Not overcooked, not dry, just right. Had several of them along with a chicken shawarma sandwich, fully loaded of course. Asked for some pickles on the side, the fine gentleman was more than happy to oblige. I will be returning to try the kabobs and the dips, they make it a point to inform you, everything is made fresh daily, and by the taste, it's hard to argue. Finally a Lebanese place in Newmarket/Aurora worth returning to..."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and the food is made fresh for you. Really liked the garlic potatoes... Full of flavour. Only thing is that you have to wait. But if you have the time it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. Perfect place for snacks; kebeh, manakeesh, pastries, soups, appetisers."}
{"text":"This seems like a family run restaurant, husband and wife. 
Food was fairly cheap and Owner was super friendly. Chicken shawerma plate came with a drink for  $10; not the best shawerma I had and not a lot of meat but it's fine given the price is fairly cheap. 
It's a good place for quick bite if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Talal is amazing chef! Always home made food fresh daily! So friendly, he is always offering samples of new food for you to try. Best customer service and great prices. 

How can you go wrong !"}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma in Newmarket!!! I've heard about this new place and had to give it a try.  Wide range of Lebanese dishes that are all made fresh to order.  The owner is engaged with his customers and has amazing food on his menu.  This is a family owned and run restaurant and anything you order on this menu will not disappoint.  So here's what we had:

Fresh to order Falafel 
Yes they are! Unlike other restaurants that have them premade and cooked and sitting there, here at Chez Talal they cook them fresh to order.  The best falafel I have ever had!!

Veggie Supreme
All I can say is wow!  Vegetables and lettuce and a mix of sauces are combined.  He also adds a pomegranate sauce from Lebanon that tastes out of this world and we topped it with beef shawarma.  The beef was out of this world!!  I have never had a dish like this and one of my favourites.

Chicken Shawarma Dinner
Fresh juicy chicken shawarma with tahini, garlic paste, vegetables and rice.  Plus a pita.  Great portion and fresh and delicious.

Baba Ganouj
Homemade goodness.  Topped with special spices and pomegranate seed.

A Spinach Meat Pie
Spinach, herbs and spices, lemon filled in a home made dough.  So good!

A Meat Pie
Amazing meat and homemade dough.

The owner will offer samples, friendly and proud of the great dishes he's producing.

The most fresh Mediterranean food I've had in Newmarket and surrounding areas.  A real jewel and can't wait to be back!!"}
