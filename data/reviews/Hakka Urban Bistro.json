{"text":"Words can't describe my experience at this wonderful restaurant! From the lovely staff to the very own chef who has created an assortment of delicious meals and desserts! The food was incredible and I left there wanting to taste more things!! We will definitely be coming back and ordering from you!! All the Best."}
{"text":"Love this place! The decor is inviting and elegant, and the service is friendly, attentive, and quick. The dishes were flavourful, not at all overwhelming, with just the right amount of spice. The food was fresh and steaming and ready to be devoured! The host made sure my daughter, who has a nut allergy, was well taken care of and accommodated. The fried bananas are absolutely amazing and the lemongrass ice cream is out of this world, a must have! We will definitely become regulars!"}
{"text":"This place was a nice find!  Great food... and at such a reasonable price!  The Manchurian beef, butter chicken and sweet and sour fish were amazing... banana fritter things for dessert was delish too."}
{"text":"I love this place. LOVE.  Everything I've ever tried has been soo good. Last night I tried the Karahi Gosht for the first time and I'm completely hooked! Not even kidding I might go back today for more.  The staff is friendly and the food is incredible. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Family run joint, so support it even more for that reason. Everything made fresh, takes time but patience worth it. Crispy Beef 5/5 one of the best I've ever had. Pineapple Chicken 5/5 Dry Chill Chicken 5/5 Wings/Black Pepper Chicken Balls...Excellent."}
{"text":"Found ourselves in the area and visited them again a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing experience. I had a Chilli fish with rice. It was fantastic. Wife liked her dish as well. The service was great as last time.  Now that's the kind of restaurant I can drive from Brampton to eat at, when I have an itch for Chinese food. You don't see such fresh ingredients being used at a hakka restaurant often. May be I ordered the wrong dish last time or it was a little off, but my experience this time was fantastic."}
{"text":"Really nice combination of food. Tried the chilly beef and green curry - highly recommended. Very nice service also"}
{"text":"Amazing service.... never had no fork or spoon on table... water was wormed(tap).... pad Thai was very tasty...even with the chefs hair rolled up in It...,I sent It back awesome.... they brought me one nice fresh one back It even had peanuts in It... I was allergic.... I told them that the first order.... but the server was awesome (no lie she was nice)"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Hakka cuisine. I tried this restaurant out with a few coworkers. We grabbed chilli chicken Poutine, garlic shrimp balls and chicken corn soup. I really liked the chilli chicken poutine, nice and spicy with green and red chilli, big chunks of chicken, gravy went nice with the cheese and fries. Chicken corn soup was excellent, good consistency, I personally hate it when it's too thick. The restaurant has a very clean modern aesthetic with a small bar. The owner was very friendly and my food was out quickly considering it was lunch rush, looks fairly busy around lunch time so you may want to call ahead to check. If you're a fan of Hakka definitely check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, and ordered the manchurian chicken dish. It came with rice and the meat had some kick to it. The food although a bit spicy, was pretty tasty and flavourful! Our server, an older woman was soo friendly and sweet! Throughout the entire ordeal, she always had a smile on her face, apologized for not having the table set up previously - didn't have any issues, but she was still so informative and you could tell she genuinely wanted her guests to have a good time. She even came to our car to give me back my ring which I had left on the table. I will never forget that!"}
{"text":"The chili beef is awesome coupled with a bowl of soup for 8 bucks. Very friendly service in a serene setting with relaxing background music. It is my weekly lunch stop. Great variety on the menu and the Indian dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I live nearby and have been waiting for a great Hakka restaurant. This place is very clean, friendly staff, and the food quality is top notch. Everything we ordered was clearly made from scratch with no compromise on quality. They're new to the neighborhood and will hopefully also introduce a delivery service soon."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now and tried various dishes. This is 100% authentic Indo Chinese otherwise known as Hakka in the GTA. The family is from Kolkata and makes some great dishes. This place is right up there with some of Hakka places that have been here for the past 30 years, better than any of the new joints that try and pass their food as authentic."}
{"text":"Brand new and very clean.  Excellent food and always friendly.  We live just north and often ate at the previous two restaurants that were at this location, one Indian and another Hakka, and these guys are the best of the three.  Family owned and operated. Menu has lots to offer.  They use high quality meat like you'd cook at home.  And despite having some really tasty sauces and curries, your clothes don't stink when you leave.  They were able to provide lots of options to my brother who can't do gluten, eggs or dairy.  I definitely suggest you give then a try."}
{"text":"Chef/owner went to the washroom and didn't wash his hands...he then went back into the kitchen to continue cooking and at no point did he stop to wash his hands before preparing food."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a Hakka restaurant that does great Asian and Indian food like this one!  Usually Hakka restaurants excel at Chinese/Thai cuisine but falter on the Indian fusion.  But this place is exceptional at both!  I was surprised at how amazing the Indian dishes were including tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and the amazing eggplant dish.  They were better dishes than many dedicated Indian restaurants can make.  Can't decide on whether you want to Chinese, Thai or Indian food tonight?  You don't have to choose because this restaurant can make all those cuisines amazingly!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was a little tricky to find, the signs weren't lit at night so we passed it a few times before finally calling in to figure out the correct spot ( across from TD in the Plaza). It seems to be a small family run place, with a rather  simplistic yet cozy interior. We were greeted promptly however, despite only having one other table to serve, we weren't served water for what felt like at least 10 minutes until getting up to ask for it at the counter the second time around (took one star away  for that reason).   We ordered Tom Yum Soup (8/10), Seafood coconut soup (10/10), Pad Thai (surprisingly a little sweeter than assumed 7/10), and Mango Chicken (10/10). The food was served pretty quickly, the hostess herself served us swiftly and came to check up on us a few times as well thereafter. To sum up, I can definitely see myself going there again especially to try out the Chilli Chicken Poutine on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Great food with friendly and quick service! We ordered the Hub Spicy Wings, Tom Yum Soup, and House Special Hakka Chow Mein to share. Portion sizes were good for two people. The shrimp in the Tom Yum soup were very fresh, the wings were  juicy but were more mild than spicy, and the noodles had a delicious off-the-wok taste. Our waitress (and possibly the owner) was also very nice in giving us a bigger portion of soup to share. Will definitely be coming back again especially on days we don't want to cook!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places for lunch. I always grab the food to go. Very friendly ,helpful and altogether pleasant lady at the cash. I got the golden curry lunch special today. Their portions are enough for 2 lunches for me. Also their spicy fries, tho just spiced. Are to die for :)"}
{"text":"Excellent place, friendly staff and owner, food is always fresh and cooked to order, great for brining clients and quick lunches"}
{"text":"Was looking for something other than run-down Hakka No. 1 or Bros for a Friday night... SO GLAD we stumbled across Hakka Urban Bistro.  Everything was flavourful, spicy, and reasonably priced ($10-12) per dish. The place is clean, modern, and the hostess is super friendly.   We had the HUB Special spicy chicken (appetizer) that (I think) are chicken pakora. Approximately $8 if I remember correctly, but was a really good portion. The chicken was sooo soft and juicy and the batter was light and spicy. Amaze-balls.  We also had the Manchurian Beef that was super saucy. My fav to mix with rice.  Next we had the chicken masala... also amazing. Spicy yet light, and loaded with chicken. No veggies in this dish, just straight up chicken and curry.   Last was the house special fried rice. It was good - nothing out of the ordinary but it was nice to have both chicken and shrimp. Also nice to actually see the eggs. This dish was also a bit more dry than Chinese stores, but that's cool too cause ya'll should lay off the oil."}
{"text":"Flew in to visit family in the greater Toronto area and nostalgia for Indo-Chinese food got the better of us.....  Service was slow - we got our drinks immediately after we got there but it took them a full 20 minutes to come back to get our food order (and this after two treks to the counter) and another 35 minutes thereafter for the food to show up. There was a party of six that left in a huff after having waited 50 minutes with nothing to show for it, so tardiness seemed to be a bit of a recurring theme.   We had the Chicken Manchurian, Chili Chicken and the Sweet and Sour chicken - decent sized portions  but oddly enough none of the entrees came with rice....Which I found rather incongruous for a Chinese restaurant.  Overall, I'd rate the food a solid 8 out of 10, but the poor service and desultory attitude of the owners/waitstaff pretty much rendered the whole experience intolerable."}
{"text":"tried veggie chowmein .. chicken manchurian & pepper chicken appetizer . Very good  New place"}
{"text":"We happened by this place by chance on Friday evening. It was impeccable service from the beginning to end, with a friendly chat and too it off excellent food!  We had the corn chowder soup (made vegan on request), Manchurian noodles and the chilli paneer. They are very flexible in substitutions, which is perfect especially for vegetarians or anyone else with any allergies. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"By far the best chowmein i have tried in canada. Yes Canada... and trust me i have tried many in Alberta, manitoba and ontario.  The owner is a very nice and sweet lady.. i just loved this place so much good energy and vibes.. feels just right here."}
{"text":"Was hungry on my way to a meeting and pulled into this plaza. Being a fan of Hakka, I chose this restaurant over the others and boy am I glad I did.   A disclaimer. I'm a big fan of Hakka style food and as a result, I've been to a lot of Hakka restaurants.   I arrived at 5pm. The place was empty. I figured it must be the timing as everyone was making their way home.   The place is relatively new and has a very modern clean vibe which is nice. Seating for about 40.   All of the tables were nicely set and everything was spotless. I've never been to a restaurant that is this clean (including the bathrooms).   After some deliberation, and trying to eat healthier, I opted for the spicy Thai fish with steamed rice.   Took about 12 min to arrive which was fair.   The fish was extremely tender and flavourful. The sauce is spicy but not overbearing (I can handle heat but don't like food too spicy as it kills all the other delicious flavours).   Generous portion of fish served in a delicious spicy sauce finished with coriander.   The steamed rice was cooked perfectly.   My only bone to pick is that there were a lot of lemon grass blades in the fish sauce - so almost every time you bite, you're chewing on the lemongrass. While flavourful, it's not very pleasant to chew on especially when you're tying to enjoy the actual meal. I'd recommend that the cook remove the blades of lemon grass prior to serving.   The pieces ranges from .30-1cm. Some of them were obvious to the eye, whereas most of them surprises you when it's too late.   All in all, this is an excellent restaurant with delicious food and great service. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was clean and the dinning was absolutely set up very nicely. The service was great! The lady there was super sweet and made sure she attended to all the customers in a very timely manner including myself. The food was good and was comparable to the other Hakka restaurants I've visited. However, the chow mein was a little too oily and the biriyani was a little plain. Overall, it was a pretty good restaurant and will definitely be visiting again. I rate this place 4/5 because I have had better but hopefully during my next visit I can rate this 5/5."}
{"text":"Having tried a range of Hakka restaurants in GTA, I can say this restaurant deserves a write up.  Very nuanced dishes, prepared with care.  We ordered basil fried rice, beef green curry, chicken with assorted vegetables banana fritters, soups and Hakka chicken appetizer.  Everything was excellent, only caveat was some dishes were slightly salty."}
{"text":"We were in the area and searched Yelp for vegetarian options. This place had quite a few on the menu and good reviews. Turns out they didn't have most of the vegetarian dishes on their menu. No lentils, chick peas, paneer; they were out of everything except eggplant and tofu. Eggplant was pretty good but mostly sauce not a lot of eggplant. Tofu was ok but the sauce wasn't the best. The place was clean, server was nice and seemed to feel bad they were out of stuff. Don't make a trip here if you're looking for vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service. Very fresh and tasty authentic hakka food. Clean restaurant with nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations.  It is by far the best Hakka/Indian food I've ever had.  My one co-worker was even a skeptic, but was raving about the meal days later.  I ended up getting two entrees, but portion sizes were plenty for an average appetite.  It has just the right level of spice, it had a good kick but able to enjoy the flavor.  The dinning space was very casual.  Perfect for lunch and take out.  We got dinner and dined in.  We will definitely be back to this place when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both of the times I loved the food and service both.  It is a family owned restaurant with a twist to Asian food. Their food is fresh and served with warmth.  I loved the veggie Manchurian pakora, just amazing and so unique in taste. Sprint rolls are good too. I love spicy a d their house chilly sauce is adds a nice kick to the food. Veggie chowmein  was excellent, this is one or few places to make the perfect chowmein."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!! I didn't know what to order because everything looks delicious and the menu was huge, so the waitress helped us out and man, was she on point with her recommendations! The staff is amazing and the food was delicious. Everything tasted fresh and was perfectly cooked! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the golden chicken curry, assorted vegetable with chicken and 2 steamed rice. The food was fresh, smelled great and tasted great too! It's not cheap (50 bucks altogether), but then again I'm happy I paid more because the quality was definitely worth the price! My only complaint, and it's barely one, was that the potato in the golden chicken dish was too small. I'm used to large chunks, almost quartered potatoes. These ones were cut real thin and in strips. But other than that the taste was great. If you're going to order it, tell them easy on the spice, the golden chicken is a strong \"medium\" I would say. I'll be trying some other their other dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Delicious.   Just finished my first meal at Hakka and it won't be my last. Mango chicken and Manchurian beef were great."}
{"text":"10000000/10000000 is my review!!!!! The owner is extremely caring and friendly! The atmosphere was perfect! Extremely clean!   The food was the best Hakka my boyfriend (who is Indian) and I have ever had!!  We ordered: Vegetable spring rolls - mouth watering!! Black pepper chicken (kinda looked like pakoras)- BLEW OUR MINS!! We could have had another order! Tandoori chicken- was so juicy and soft and melted in our mouths omg yes! Chilli chicken dry - BLOW AWAY FROM THE FLAVOUR!! Thai fried rice - I could have ate the entire plate to my self - and it was huge !! For dessert we got the fried banana with icecream AND THE STRAWBERRY SAUCE, chocolate shavings and the little cookie was all home made!  Clearly no words can describe how good it is until you have gone yourself! It's new to the area so let's show it some love!"}
{"text":"I finally returned for another dose of Hakka at HUB....this time I decided to push the Hakka boundary \"lets see what they can do\" so I ordered the Chili Chicken lunch special.   As usual, I had my choice of spring roll or daily soup, I opted for the Sweet & Sour soup. Again  I found the soup mediocre at best, it was not bad but absolutely nothing stood out. Regardless, the Chilli Chicken was were I wanted to focus my attention as this is a Hakka mainstay and where all Hakka restaurants hang their hat.   So how was it?....hmm, I will start off by saying the food was fresh, no cartilage (again almost expected when eating Hakka), served with white rice, I asked for substitution even though it says no subs, was told they can make an exception since it was quiet but it would set me back another $3 dollars for noodle, little to rich for my taste (guess that's another way to discourage exceptions).   Got my plate and dug in, it looked great. Despite all the good, I was disappointed, not from the taste but from the obvious attempt to be overly safe, I found there was little to no heat, even though there were green chili's on the plate! There were no chilies on the table that I could add to the plate and as a result, it was bland and tasteless.   Overall, HUB is a great place to start your Hakka journey and go from there, I still stand by the 4 stars and would recommend HUB to those noobs looking to venture into good Hakka food, but, it looks like I will have to venture back to Scarborough if I want to get something a little more authentic. My only recommendation to the restaurant would be to ask what heat level customers would prefer, perhaps that would help to crank up the flavors wherever possible, oh a substitutions help too ;)"}
{"text":"I like this place for their lunch specials and food freshness.  I ordered the red curry with chicken lunch special. This came with rice and a spring roll. The spring roll was literally dripping of oil and didn't have enough filling.  The portion of the curry was massive and to my liking. I got  a generous amount of chicken, curry and eggplants. It was packed with flavour and my taste buds were satisfied. The reason I m giving it 3 stars is because it had way too much oil. The entire day after my meal I kept getting nasty oil burps. Hence I will not be ordering the same thing again.  The green curry that I have tried before was great and I would recommend that. They just need to keep it easy on the oil!"}
{"text":"I loved the friendly service here. The lady was super sweet and she made it feel like such an inviting place. The menu was simple to read with plenty of options. I had the pineapple thai style chicken. It was delicious! And the portion size was good. The lunch special came with a spring roll or soup and steamed rice. I had the spring roll and it was just right and my boyfriend had the hot and sour soup which he said was flavourful. He also had the Manchurian chicken and he gave it 2 thumbs up. I would definitely make this a regular spot to come back to. Great customer service experience. The lady also gave my boyfriend an excellent pointer: \"a lady has a big heart\". Only the three of us know the story behind this but overall this joint deserves a 5/5 for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place, fast, fresh and huge flavor. Try the Manchurian or chili chicken, you won't be disappointed. The lunch special comes with your choice of soup or spring roll. Really good."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few hakka places and this was one of the better ones. The lunch and dinner menus have a wide variety of options and the general decor and presentation of the restaurant and food are pretty good. The only issue that one might notice was the service was a bit slow, but the quality of the food definitely made up for it."}
{"text":"We went in and we were the only customers. The owner was very nice ans seated us promptly. We ordered the chilli chicken, manchurian chicken, chili beef, chili chicken wings and hot garlic veggies. Even we were the only customers the food came very slow (20-40min) The food was fresh and delicious. However it lacked the strong herb and spices of authentic hakka food that im used to. The menu also did not offer bombay chicken which is my favourite hakka food. Decent food in a nice atmosphere. Just make sure you have company to entertain yoy during the wait!"}
