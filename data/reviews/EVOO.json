{"text":"Welcoming tasty confort food! EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) is a cool place offering a variety of dishes. I've been here 3 maybe 4 times and they never fail to deliver. As usual, when my head is pounding with the repercussions of a crazy night,  I need to fuel up with high amounts of proteins. 

This is why you can't go wrong with the Full Irish breakfast plate which is rich in energy. The plate is super tasty with gaspor sausage,  eggs, back bacon (yummy), black pudding, piglet liver,  soda bread, a grilled tomato and potatoes. Needless to say all this  will fill you up big time and partially erase any hangover. 

Although full,  I'm a glutton and I had to satisfy my sweet tooth. I had remembered loving their scones back in the day. Although they weren't on the menu the waitress made them happen and OMG they are freaking deliciouuuuus! 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"We recently attended the company Holiday dinner at EVOO. The restaurant is small so they closed it for us and treated us like family. The food... a three course menu with choices for each course had some thing for everyone.  All very tasty but I have to admit my favorite course was the two hour cocktail and superb appetizers ..salmon mouse, pate, crudités all sourced locally and the cocktails were fantastic!"}
{"text":"You can always ask for a few things to be better at any restaurant. EVOO is no exception here however its incredible service really sets it apart. Because of food intolerances the chef created a custom dessert for me which was truly wonderful. Spent a full half hour making it. Really went above and beyond. Food was very well prepared and innovative if not a little sparse. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Fool me once.....

Needless to say Evoo will not fool me twice.  If Cuisine Soignée stands for \"If I make it sound fancy, and make it look fancy then I can overcharge and no one will be the wiser.\"  I'm not implying that is what they set out to do but....

I was there for brunch a couple of weeks ago with 5 other friends and we were excited. The service was great, and my latte was tasty but that is really all the positive I have about the place.  Oh yeah, the chairs were comfy.  

I ordered the baked potato.  Poached egg, piglet bacon, creme fraiche, salsa verde, harissa, cheddar all over a baked potato.   Sounds great right?

WRONG.  The potato was room temperature at best and underseasoned.  The poached egg was small and the yolk did not flow over my potato as i expected.  Needless to say my dish was dry and cold and at $13 dollars unacceptable.

Fuggedaboutit'

No really, forget about it."}
{"text":"Evoo is a fun place to brunch! The large windows, comfy banquettes and the warm not noisy atmosphere give the perfect setting for a nice relax brunch. The service is attentionate and discreet to add to the feeling of privacy. The waiting staff describe nicely the most recent cocktails with homemade pulps and new inspiration plates. The lattes are delicious and the tea set adorable. 

The cuisine here is made with a lot of heart and originality. I have been here a few times and so far, each plate I tried was original and yummy. The classic full irish plate which will satisfy the biggest appetites, the tasty smoked fish with its delicate fennel and apple salad, the special house breakfast casserole and today, the shrimps etouffee. I was delighted with the quality and freshness of the shrimps and the sauce really please my tastebuds!

Finally, let's not forget the scones!!
Their scones are just so heavenly !! Although they are not always on the menu, one should ask if the chef will accept to make some or come back another day to try them! Dulce de lecce and basil creme fraiche are on top of my list."}
{"text":"C'est la 4ème fois que je viens chez Evoo (3 brunchs et un souper).
Claudie, vous accueille avec le sourire et offre toujours beaucoup de détails sur les plats et la carte, ce qui est toujours grandement apprécié.
J'ai eu l'honneur de rencontrer le chef aujourd'hui, Peter, qui m'a lui même apporté mon full Irish.  Ce fut délicieux, encore meilleur que les fois précédentes, peut-être le fait que le chef me l'ai servi lui-même 
Autre raison pour venir ici, le choix des ingrédients, on perçoit très bien l'importance que ça a dans les plats et dans les saveurs qui nous sont transmises.

Pour un épicurien, comme moi, l'important ce n'est pas la quantité, mais la qualité et chez Evoo, vous trouverez ça. 
De plus cette petite touche Irlandaise apportée par Peter, apporte une touche d'originalité.

Je tiens à préciser que je n'ai pas été soudoyer par Evoo, c'est juste mon avis. 

A bientôt"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with a friend Sunday morning. The staff was friendly and my meal (baked eggs with veal meat balls, tomato sauce and cheddar cheese) was outstanding. Will definitely return in the near future for dinner."}
{"text":"Spent New Year's Eve there. The food was amazing, farm to table style with all local products from Quebec. 

Try the Francobolli (big ravioli with homemade ricotta) or the slow cooked bison. The $37 menu on Thursday is a real bargain... 
The warm chocolate cake was sublime and the perfect way to end our meal. Wish they had more vegetarian main dishes. 
Cosy decor and friendly service. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, nicely seasoned and spiced. We had a very tasty brunch.  Love that they make so much themselves and buy mainly from local farmers. Friendly service. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went for MTL à Table event at EVOO. We ordered the appetizer fish escabeche for appetizer and was really tasty. The pickled veggies married really well with the fish and tomato jam. Second appetizer was amuse bouche of roasted Brussels with beets and  walnut dressing. It had a nutty flavor from walnut, bitter roasted Brussels and earthiness of beet went very well. If i am down there again will definitely visit."}
{"text":"I like this place..as you can tell by the ratings.

I came here once on a last minute \"must find a brunch place\" whim, and was pleasantly surprised and happy with the service, food, and prices. The warm milk-rum-banana drink was out.of.this.world amazing and so is their apple coleslaw. I came back just to get those 2 items but then got distracted by many other items on the menu....

The menu itself is very limited but every item is creative. The only negative is that their fried items are a little too oily (ex. the hashbrowns in the Breakfast Sandwich plate) but overall great place that I'll definitely be back to!"}
{"text":"For full review and many photos check out the link below!

EVOO was an amazing meal! It's been a month but I'm still thinking about the fried poached egg that they have. SO GOOD. 

The service is amazing, the atmosphere fits the restaurant perfectly, and the prices are fair. Without a doubt I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Just got back from EVOO.  I live one block from this restaurant. I've passed by this place  so many times but the name and under the name, EVOO, \"Cuisine Soignée\" bothered me.. ( (whisper) the real fine dining, fine cuisine restaurants don't say they serve fine cuisine, don't ya think? :P)   

Well~ This morning inspired by New York Time http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/05/12/travel/20130512-SURFACING-5.html

I decided to try my neighborhood restaurant while I live here - Oh~ I am moving out of Montreal the end of this month so I need to go to all the places that I want to go and yelp it !

Hummmm Scones!  I wanted to eat as dessert but I was full :P  Order it as starter.  You will love it.  It kinda reminded Lawrence donuts( I love them too ) but it was scone :)  Yumm!

The eggs are perfectly cooked.  All the breakfast meats were super yummy.  
My husband said it's the best breakfast place in Montreal. I think so too.  ( better than Lawrence)   All the ingredients seem very fresh and high quality.

The name isn't that attractive but other than that everything was great :)"}
{"text":"I know it's tempting especially within the St Henri area to head over to Joe Beef or Tuck shop. But EVOO's service has it on lock. You truly are treated like family when you visit here. After a year since visiting this establishment, they immediately recognized me and embraced me as one of their own as if I never skipped a beat. You can't fake this kind of warmth. Sophie, Peter  and Claudie are amazing and they care tremendously about their food and customers. I can't praise them enough for what they're trying to do here. While other reviews may nitpick minor details about them and their food, what I had here last year and today are exceptionally well prepared and it shows the attention to detail they pay to their food as well as service. I would wholeheartedly recommend any lone business travelers to give them a try and sit at the bar. Chat up the staff and owners and actually get to know them and what they're trying to do. Simply put EVOO has won me over with their food, service and genuine warmth. Can't find better restaurant peeps. PS. The cocktails that Claudie makes are amazing. Try the Monticello and the raspberry cocktail. Both are superb."}
{"text":"I've been to EVOO twice now a year apart and both times they've been superb. From their original cocktails to their fresh bread to their delightful amuse bouche, their welcoming, inviting and low key atmosphere is a fresh departure from the other nearby establishments.

Go there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Location: On Notre-Dame east of Atwater. It's about a 10-minute walk from Lionel-Groulx metro. 

Service: Excellent - the wait staff was super friendly! Our waitress took the time to explain every single dish, including how each drink was made. Our water glasses were always full, and she came by frequently to see how we were doing. This was my first time at EVOO and I was really impressed with the stellar service. 

Vibe/Decor: Judging by their music, I could swear they raided my personal collection - so... great music with a pretty chill vibe. Personally, I found the decor to be a little outdated and lacking in energy. It was pretty dim but I think they're currently going with lavender walls with some purple striping here and there. 

Food: Pics are forthcoming, along with the full menu. We started with a delightfully warm dinner roll that was made with tomatoes and... onions? I don't remember but the bread was freshly made and delicious, served with olive oil. Our waitress then unexpectedly brought over an amuse-bouche - a sliver of beet with some other stuff on top. I love beets so this was a hit for me. Before I continue, I should mention that there seems to be a LOT involved with their ingredients (i.e. there are a LOT of them), making it hard to keep up with every little detail. 

Drinks: Tanqueray, raspberry, basil, lemon and sparkling water. AMAZING!

Starter: Homemade Ricotta with anchovy sauce and croutons. While I liked the texture and consistency of the ricotta (it was obvious that it was fresh, too), it left me feeling underwhelmed from a flavor perspective. There just wasn't enough of it. 

In-between the starter and main, our waitress brought over sorbet to cleanse our palate. The flavor was super unique and interesting - Quebec tomatoes. I really enjoyed this - it felt fresh and you could really taste the tomato.  

Main: Cabbage rolls stuffed with rabbit and served in a lemongrass broth, with carrots, potatoes and radish as sides. Again, it was obvious to me that each dish was freshly prepared. But, like the ricotta, the flavor of this dish was lacking, overall. The rabbit had a pleasant and distinct taste that I enjoyed but I couldn't really taste the lemongrass in the broth. The veggies were delicious but undercooked. The dish was served with two cabbage rolls and they were huge. I think one would have been enough for me - so no complaints about portion sizes! I think I would have preferred it if the rolls weren't so packed with rabbit - it sort of felt like I was eating big fat sausages and I think that 'looser' meat would've felt less filling. I liked this dish, but it was in need of seasoning.  My friend ordered the Francobolli - ravioli stuffed witih ricotta and topped with a roasted sesame crust. I had a taste and again, zero flavor. 

Dessert: I don't know that I would call this dessert - basically, I had a piece of goat cheese (cheddar) with some jam, caramelized pecans and lavosh (like a flat bread). The menu indicated that the jam was strawberry but that wasn't the case, as when the dish was served to me, the waitress said it was wild cherries (cerises de terre). I loved the lavosh, but when I think dessert, I think something decadent and sweet. The other option was bananas with caramel and creme fraiche, but that whole combo just doesn't work for me and that's why I opted for the cheese. 

Verdict: I had really  high hopes for this place, but left feeling underwhelmed. While I did enjoy the meal, and appreciated the great service, I'm not sure if I would go back or not.  You should check it out for yourself and see what you think - it does have good potential."}
{"text":"Wanted to try somewhere new for brunch and this place had been on my radar for a while.  Headed out with kids and a few friends to try it out.  Just east of the Atwater market, it has a simple, fresh and slightly rustic decor with vintage kitchen implements on the walls.  This is not one of those \"eggs every way you can imagine and 47 varieties of waffles\" kind of brunch place.  The menu is short, only about 6 brunch items on offer, with the philosophy that it is best to do a few things very well.  So it may not be the best choice if you like a lot of variety at brunch.  Also not the best for younger children as there is no kids menu and the menu is fairly sophisticated.  My 13 year old was happy with her banana chocolate French toast, the only sweet item on the menu.  I had the smoked fish, which was a delicious piece of freshly smoked salmon, with eggs and apple slaw.  Baby was content to gum away on the accompanying toast.  Wonderful fresh ingredients, well prepared and just the right portion size to leave you full but not stuffed.  Also had a very good chai latte made from scratch.  Service was friendly and attentive.  It was slow-ish, but in a good \"it's Saturday brunch, relax and take your time\" kind of way.  They also do dinner, will have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Montreal was the first stop on our 3 city Canadian vacation.  We had a beautiful room at the Ritz Carlton.  Maison Boulud is the hotel restaurant and bar, and we enjoyed many hours eating and drinking there (be sure to get the Madeline's).  One of our bartenders there suggested we go to EVOO for brunch and we did--what a great decision!
It was a 10 minute cab from our hotel, in a kind of sketchy area with multi-national restaurants surrounding.
EVOO is a modern space graced by a trio of Owners/Chefs.  The food choices are creative and different from your usual brunch fare.  They make some awesome drinks.  The price is reasonable.
After brunch we took a cab to Notre Dame Cathedral which was fun and an interesting area.  We took a carriage ride.
Montreal is a magnificent city, not as big as Toronto and not as small as Quebec City.  Perfect size IMHO.
EVOO is highly recommended!

{"text":"Nice fancy small restaurant. I could tell by the portions that it has a french flavor in the place. Althought their pricey menu, I still could enjoy their walleye tartare (tartarefest). The fish was well prepared and felt fresh. 

The waitress was kind and very friendly. I liked the ambience of the place. 

I would cone back for their regular menu, whenever I'd feel fancy enough :P"}
{"text":"J'ai été au restaurant EVOO un vendredi soir frisquet. J'étais accompagné de ma douce. Le restaurant est situé sur Notre-Dame au 3426 Notre-Dame Ouest. C'est à côté du Marché Atwater dans le Sud-Ouest.

En entrant, on remarque une signature classe. Tout est propre, on a un mur de teintes mauve que ma blonde aimait beaucoup. Il y a beaucoup de mauve quand même. Le restaurant se veut chic.

Le service est quand même impeccable. Très bien reçu et très bien servi tout au long du repas, rien à redire là-dessus.

On y offre des  entres-repas. J'appelle ça entre-repas, des petites bouchées entre les repas. 

Ce n'est malheureusement pas un apportez votre vin. Ma blonde a pris un cocktail maison très bon, c'était avec de la purée de framboises et du basilic avec du gin.

Le restaurant met l'emphase sur la provenant des aliments. Il met beaucoup d'importance sur les aliments préparés au Québec. Tout au long du repas, vous serez donc expliqué sur la provenance des aliments.

Menu : 6-7 plats allant de 21 à 29$.

Pour commencer, nous avons eu du pain frais et chaud provenant de la bête à pain. Ensuite, premier entre-repas, deux petits ronds de betteraves avec un peu de fromage de chèvre fait maison et de la peau de poisson frite. C'est un goût différent.

Ensuite venait notre entrée. Nous avons pris un oeuf entouré de prosciutto frit sur une salade. C'était rafraîchissant comme goût. Nouveau. Nous avons pris l'entrée à deux et c'était en masse comme entrée. Je recommande.



Ensuite venait le 2e entre-repas. C'était une limonade maison congelé pour faire comme un popsicle avec un peu de poudre de limette qui pétille dans la bouche. C'est comme des bonbons, mais avant le repas principal. C'était bien plaisant.

Venait ensuit le plat de résistance. J'ai pris le steak. Il ne portait pas ce nom, car ce n'était pas exactement un steak, mais c'était semblable.

C'était bon. Je m'attendais à dequoi de relativement meilleur pour une plat à 29$, mais je pense que j'avais de très hautes attentes.  Ma blonde a pris le francobolli et WOW. C'est un genre de ravioli avec du fromage ricotta à l'intérieur, mais avec un extérieur différent que de la pâte. J'ai eu un crush sur son plat plus que le mien.

Le meilleur moment du repas arrive... le dessert!

Belle sélection de dessert je dois dire. J'haïs devoir faire un choix dans un restaurant du genre. Mon choix s'est arrêté sur le dessert le plus sucré, bien sûr. Du bannofee... banofi.. banane-toffee. Ce dessert est une tarte habituellement, mais le restaurant a préféré \"l'ouvrir\". On y trouve : banane, toffee fait maison, crême et biscuit. 

J'ai de la misère à l'expliquer, mais c'est bon.


Je dirais un 4/5. Je suis content d'avoir pu goûter un autre bon restaurant du sud-ouest!"}
{"text":"Food: Was good. I've watched every single episode of Top Chef and I'm assured the chef at EVOO did too as the menu consisted of dishes made on the show. Pretty much. 


Ambiance: Clean, minimalist and cold. It had a cafeteria feel. Dimmed lights and candles are majorly needed here. Hint!! 

I had a great time with my girlfriends despite being the only ones there on a Thursday night. 

Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"A great experience with this farm to fork restaurant. The food was very fresh and menu appear limited to what was fresh for the day. Cocktails and wine selections were delicious. The appetizer and entree menu has a limited 5-6 selections. We had the duck and venison which were cooked perfectly. Soft shell crab and beef carpaccio were a great appetizer. Service was friendly and attentive. Would definitely come again and recommend to my friends that want to try food that is unique. Desserts were on point. A great food experience overall!"}
{"text":"Super service, beau decort! Les choix de plats sont limites mais recherchés. Il y a du pain maison sans gluten trop bon et quelques choix de dejeuner paleo. 

J'ai pris les oeufs en casserol sauce tomate et boulette de veau du quebec, c'etait tres bon, mais rien de special. Mon ami a pris le sandwich Gospar, selon lui très bon. mais j'ai trouvé que ca ressemblait a un croque monsieur! On a aussi pris des scones maison, bon mais pas wow. Parcontre, ils etaient a la farine de blé, donc c'est plus dure a juger. Rapport qualité prix très bien."}
{"text":"L'intérieur est classe, bien décoré et lumineux, c'est spacieux !
Première déception cependant en venant manger un midi en semaine et se rendant compte que c'était une carte de brunch. Un jeudi midi j'ai envie de manger un lunch, pas un brunch ou au mieux d'avoir le choix entre les 2 !
Deuxième déception quand j'ai vu qu'il n'y avait aucun choix végé dans les plats excepté un granola aux fruits.
Ok pour un brunch mais pour un lunch ca passe moins bien, surtout très dérangeant qu'il n'y ait aucun plat végé. J'ai fillouté en prenant 2 hashbrown à coté pour \"remplir\" un peu le ventre en plus du granola qui n'est pas le plat le plus consistant du monde ...
En dessert le gateau au chocolat était bon, d'ailleurs comme tous les plats mangés.
Au niveau des prix j'ai trouvé ca un peu cher, heureusement que c'était un repas payé par ma boite car sinon je l'aurais encore moins apprécié ...
Pas convaincu en l'état, je ne reviendrais pas de ma propre personne."}
{"text":"Things you say when you taste your food at EVOO: \"Oooooh my goood!\"
Amazing everything, the super courteous waiting staff will explain the complex menu in great details.
We had the home made beignets for dessert (that's right, couldn't resist a \"breakfast dessert\") which we devoured before I had a chance to photograph. Sigh...
Way to go chefs!! I'm single, feel free to call me."}
{"text":"Service impeccable. Nourriture excellente. Ambiance reposante. Bon rapport versus prix. À conseiller. Réservation facile. Service rapide. Bonne portion. Présentation soignée."}
{"text":"Just disappointing. Maybe my expectations were unjustifiably high, but this place definitely takes itself very seriously, so why shouldn't I?

The decore is nice but a bit formal for my personal liking. If they were able to back it up with food to match, I wouldn't care, but they didn't.

All the serving sizes were small, and none of the dishes cheap. I got the their 'big' breakfast, and it came with ONE egg. I didn't even know people did breakfasts (let along 'big' ones) with one egg - what's the point? It had a 'hint' of bacon, a sausage that was nothing if not forgettable, and two small pieces of toast. There was some other stuff, but I can't recall what it was - it was that kidn of meal.

The food was 'meh', and the prices were 'ooof'. No-one got sick, but I've got to give this place one star."}
{"text":"Came to Montreal on a business trip and found the restaurant when searching online for \"Farm-to-Table, Montreal\". Made reservations for two for supper. 

Service was the best it could be, with our sever Claudie being incredibly friendly and helpful. The Head Chef and Chef de cuisine exchanged bringing our dishes to the table and explaining their process in creation and how certain dishes reflected David's (Head Chef's) origins in Dublin. Very thoughtful and attentive. 

This is impressive alone for me--but then the dishes were incredibly flavorful and thoughtful. everything was delicious, but the highlights were the Butternut Squash soup and the Smoked Venison. I always thought that butternut squash soup in general was a bland soup, but this had over the top butternut flavor and the pickled mushrooms balanced the richness extremely well. The venison had a very strong smoke and tea flavor and was cooked to perfection, and i could of just eaten a bowl of the Jerusalem Artichoke sauce alone. 

Very impressed, and if I'm ever to come back to Montreal, I will immediately make reservations here again. I always feel fortunate to come to restaurants with this much passion in there food. Thank you EVOO!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times as I live near by. I think the young owners have been doing great with this place since the beginning. Nice atmosphere, good, creative and fresh food and great service is what you'll find here. Although I've never been amazed by the dinners I've had here (but greatly satisfied nonetheless), the Irish breakfast they serve at brunch is absolutely delicious! Everything is homemade, from the bread to the blood pudding. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Mon repas favori de la journée : le premier. J'adore le petit déjeuner et le brunch alors quand des amis nous ont invité à aller essayer EVOO, j'étais contente. En même temps, je n'étais pas certaine d'aimer ça. Moi j'aime un bon brunch qui remplit. Alors quand j'ai vu les photos de la nourriture, le super placement à la française avec des petites décos bien subtiles comme un point d'huile et un pétale de fleur, j'avais l'impression que ça ne serait simplement pas mon genre de brunch.

J'ai pris l'assiette poisson fumée. Thon? Saumon? Je ne sais pas, on ne nous l'a jamais indiqué, mais il était bon! Ça venait avec des ufs brouillés à perfection et une salada au choux et pommes que j'ai adorée. En fait, j'aurai pris un gros bol de la salade et j'aurai été contente! Donc de mon côté, vraiment bien comme brunch. Mais le reste de la table est restée sur son appétit un peu. Par exemple, mon chum avait pris le Big Irish. La plus grosse assiette habituellement sur le menu, mais qui n'avais qu'un seul uf. Ein? Un uf avec un GROS déjeuner? Pour 17$ l'assiette, considérant le prix des ufs, ça fait vraiment cheap. Et si j'ai bien compris, il n'a pas été impressionné du tout des viandes qui composaient le reste de l'assiette.

Côté ambiance, ça fait bistro-lounge-français un peu moderne et chi-chi, mais le service était quand même bien amiable. La seule chose que j'ai trouvé étrange était qu'on nous répète quel plat on avait devant nous en nous emmenant l'assiette. Ça peut être l'air d'un détail (et ça l'est vraiment), mais je n'ai pas besoin qu'on me répète ce que j'ai commandé, surtout un fois l'assiette placée devant moi. Ce qui m'a déçue le plus, est simplement le prix. À deux, avec nos lattes, c'est revenu à 50$. Pour un brunch, c'est cher!"}
{"text":"Two and a half years ago, I came to EVOO for a quick brunch with a friend. The experience was good enough that I told myself I should come back for dinner at some point. Well, it took awhile but for the event of MTL à Table, I finally came back last week ready to see how EVOO held up after all this time with my girlfriend and some friends of ours.

First thing of note for me was the completely change in decor. Gone was the contemporary white and purple look of before. Now, the space is more rustic in appearance with a harvest theme running through the room - use of light yellows, harvest tools and greenery on the walls, old mismatches wooden chairs and a large mirrored wall in the front. Compared to before, the space feels warmer although there is lack of pop visually and the room still feels a little empty somehow.

I also need to make mention of the wonderfully offbeat playlist that played all night - jazzy covers of pretty much anything possible from \"Stacy's Mom\" to \"Gangster's Paradise\", \"Girls Wanna have Fun\" and Kanye West's \"Only One\". For the entire night, our table was laughing and smiling at the great and weird songs to the point of asking our waitress exactly how found these songs.

We decided to start with some of their speciality cocktails. Personally, I went for the Autumn Martini - Ice Cider, bourbon, apple juice and spices. An excellent blend of sweet and spice. Officially a cocktail I need to re-attempt at home.

My girlfriend went with the rhum ground cherry - white and brown rums mixed with angostura bitters and ground cherries. Not a huge rum fan but again a very nicely balanced cocktail. A hint of bitterness to go with the spiciness of the rum and the sweetness of the ground cherry.

Amongst the four of us at our table, we were able to try the entire menu EVOO had set up for MTL à Table. The first starter was a Bass Escabeche with roasted cauliflower, yogurt, smoked tomato jam and pickled fennel. Nice tender pieces of poached bass served cold as is traditional of a escabeche. The use of the smooth yogourt and the smoky tomato jam provided nice flavour kicks to pair with the fish. A nice presentation as well.

Second starter was a homemade Ricotta salad with cucumber, brussels sprout, carrot, beet and walnut dressing. Another beautiful presentation and a wonderful fresh. A great creamy rich texture to the ricotta and the use of all those fresh vegetables matched up well with the inherent richness of the cheese. 

The final starter was a red wine onion soup with parmesan foam. The lack of that big crouton and melty cheese that we usually associate with a French onion soup made this feel a little lacking in the end. The flavour was very nice though - the red wine coming through strongly in the broth. More a question of expectations than anything else.

Our first main was the Québec bison ribs with Anthony's vegetable stew, chimichurri and pangritata. The meat off the rib was beautifully tender and juicy - simply falling off the massive rib in the plate. The pangritata breading added a little crunch and the vegetable stew provided a hearty comfort to the dish. Very enjoyable.

Next was the mushroom ravioli with Mr. Petit's confit goat, pear, crispy cipollini and parmesan. Nicely sized raviolis with a solid amount of filling. Nice flavour overall with the addition of the sweet pear provided a nice counter to the goat itself.

Finally, we had the stuffed quail with Gaspor bacon, grilled lettuce, Labrador tea, sage mascarpone and root vegetables. The bird was nice and juicy and the rest of the dish had this great feeling of being technical but still comforting. Another excellent dish.

Desserts brought further enjoyment. First was an assortment of Québec cheeses with some caramelized nuts, apple butter and fennel and coriander crackers. Next was an medley of desserts - salted caramel flan, aerial chocolate, apple, fireweed ice cream and some meringue. A great showcase of different technical skills and flavours. Very good across the board. The final option - for a little extra cost - was the Banoffee - caramelized bananas, dulce de leche, creme fraiche, shortbread and toffee. I was very happy I went for the extra cost to get this. The combination of the bananas with the caramel and the toffee was perfectly sweet and some nice crunch as well. This dish disappeared as quickly as it arrived at our table.

It may have taken me longer to come back than I hoped but EVOO thankfully did not disappoint. An excellent meal - a showcase of technique and great ingredients - that left us satisfied and full. With all the changes and new restaurants opening on Notre Dame, it's great to see EVOO is holding its own and providing a great experience.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to Evoo twice for brunch and had an amazing experience! The ambiance is modern, chic, and confortable.The food is incredible and you can taste the high quality. The chef said they buy their food from a local farm. I had pulled pork on french toast (pain doré) which I got both times since it was so good! The cute Irish chef came out and delivered our meal which made a personal touch and lasting impression.
The last time I went to Evoo I was on a date. I had to choose where to brunch. Since I was so impressed my first visit, I picked Evoo. My date was impressed with me and amazed how I found such a cute place everyone doesn't know about yet. We had a great time. I highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"Resto engagé, alliments de saison et locaux, tres bon service, belle déco sans etre luxueux, lumieres tamisées. Personellement je trouve la presentation des assiettes flayé.. une question de gout.. ( evoo : extra virgin olive oil )."}
{"text":"Servers are friendly and attentive. Food was good-very good......the heirloom toamato salad starter was excellent as was the pasta&squid starter, stuffed quail main course was very good, veal dish not so much.....Banoffi pie dessert was very very good.
Decor is minimalist and boring,seats are comfy, tables look like cheap cafeteria tables. My biggest complaint was the amount of tie this meal took.....I'm sure they are intentionally dragging the service out to keep the place looking busy....and as good as the food was...it wasn't good enough for a two and a half hour meal. Probably wont be back....."}
{"text":"Classy place with a great brunch menu and a friendly staff. I had the full Irish breakfast and a friend of mine had the BLT. Both were great with lots of homemade ingredients. Despite being stuffed we had beignets for dessert with bacon ice cream which was again delicious. Very interesting place and reasonably priced for such a great experience."}
