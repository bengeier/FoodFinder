{"text":"The food is great here, the service is great. The guy who helped me out was SUPER friendly. You almost never see that nowadays. It isn't expensive, and the food tastes fresh. Plus they have giant cookies, always a plus."}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening of this new Burrito Loco location in Great Lakes Mall. It's located in a stand on the edge the main food court, and the owner was there hosting a raffle table across from the stand itself. It looks pretty much as you would expect any food court stand to look, and operates pretty much as you would expect a build-your-own style burrito/taco/bowl place to operate. They have quite a few different meats to experiment with, and you can ask for as many sauces as your heart desires. We tried the carnitas and chorizo, neither of which I was loca about since they were lukewarm to cold temp, but the chorizo at least had some flavor and texture to it. The same cannot be said for the carnitas. The special Burrito Loco sauce definitely helped redeem the meal, as did the enthusiasm of the owner as he was talking about building out the business. 

Service was pretty speedy even with the sizable line on opening day. Prices are around $7-10 per portion depending on your protein and additional toppings (guac is an extra $2.50???). 

I know you're all thinking this too: the Monster Burrito challenge is not yet in place at this location, but they have plans to bring it soon! Unfortunately no challenge winner shirts are being made as of this moment, but you can purchase your own \"Let Us Roll You One\" shirt here."}
{"text":"This place has burritos tacos quesadillas salad bowls chips and salsa cookies Mexican sodas and other drinks. I ordered the chicken teriyaki burrito and the carnitas tacos to go. The burrito was the size of my head and you get 3 tacos with an order. My order was made fast. My burrito broke when she was rolling it so she dumped all the contents into a new shell. There is an array of toppings. Rice beans salsas pineapple fajita veggies lettuce guacamole queso sour cream and cheese. Some things are an extra charge. The chicken teriyaki had a nice flavor and the chicken was tender. The carnitas I didn't care for the taste. It was tender but not a favorite. This place is convenient right in the entrance of the mall. It's priced right for the amount of food you get. It was like 14$ for both items. I would like to try the quesadilla next time. I would recommend."}
