{"text":"Popped up to the rooftop bar last night for dinner and drinks. The location was great, service was pretty good and I got to sit in the sun for a few hours. 
The menu was limited and the food was average, but I would probably stick to drinks next time to enjoy the view without ordering a meal."}
{"text":"We went there on their grand opening day, \"May the 4th be with you\". I made a reservation just in case it, and luckily I did. My first impressions were great, the view, the layout, background music, and the atmosphere. The service was great, no complaints and well versed in the menu.

We ordered a pitcher of red Sangria (Wish it was a little stronger, but that is just my taste) and Salsa tasting (salsa verde, hot sauce butter, pico de gallo, red chimi, aji amarillo) & House Fried Tortilla Chips and they were tasty and are both recommended for you to try it. We also tried all flavored tacos, which are all great, but I find it to be pricey for paying it in full versus the happy hour price. The portion sizes to price ratio for all dishes (except tacos on happy hour) are on the small side. 

Overall, I would only come back here during happy hour, view on a nice warm days (tacos & drinks are enough to take away from this place) and nothing else."}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot for happy hour! I was greeted by the hostess at the front who directed me to the top floor for the rooftop. Once seated I had Brighton(spelling?) excellent service from start to finish. Beautiful view and everything you would need for a great happy hour. Drinks were good and I tried a fish taco which was good, kind of small, but the taste was good. Awesome experience"}
{"text":"I found this place as a top restaurant/bar to visit in Calgary before planning our trip and it didn't disappoint! Firstly, the atmosphere at the top of this building is incredible with a beautiful view of the river. We didn't have a reservation (visiting during May Long) but they quickly found us a table. The service was equally as impressive as the bar itself and our waiter, Liam, was attentive and frequently asked us if we needed anything. My husband had the tacos and I had the ceviche - both very good. Next time we're in Calgary, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Today is the third time I have been to this place for lunch. First and second ones were okay. There is not much food selection, sure. I do understand that the price point is a bit high because of the location. The only thing is, which is also the important thing for me, I look for a food establishment is customer service. The server assigned to us was very inattentive and, personally, I did not feel some sort of care from them. It had turned out a bad impression for me and going back at the rooftop patio will not be an option in the future, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes to be seated on the rooftop.
We got contacted that a table was ready for us. Waited 10 minutes for our server to come get our order.
No one came so my boyfriend went to the bar to order our drinks (because we thought maybe we had to go up ourselves). Bartender informed him we order at our table and she'd send someone our way.
We waited 10 additional minutes and no one still came.
Needless to say, we walked out.
No apology. Nothing. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Popped in for a drink and the view. The view was amazing. It was a bit breezy so it was great that they had blankets for everyone. The drinks were good, we all got pretty basic options like canned cider and vodka soda. We ordered the smashed avocado aka. guacamole to nosh on, the portion size was really small. I'd happily come back for an afternoon cocktail any day."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to try out the Rooftop Bar @ Simmons but we unfortunately never got the chance. When we got to the Simmons building, we made our way to the patio. There appeared to be many open seats. The hostess asked us if we were looking for a table for two and we replied yes. She then asked us if we had received a text. I told her that we had not and she informed us that we needed to return to the main level and check in. We proceeded back to the main level and checked in with the people in the lobby. They asked me for my cell number and told me I would get a text when a table was ready. I asked how long the wait might be and she said it would likely be over an hour. I was a bit shocked about this as I had been on the patio and there appeared to be many available tables. Not wanting to wait for over an hour my wife and I got an Uber and went to Cannibale in Bridgeland (EXCELLENT SPOT BTW). About 10 min after we had left, I received a text telling me that the table was ready. Not sure if it was a lack of communication between the patio and the main level but it was not a great experience for us, and I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Great views. Terrible food. Why does this storyline sound so common?

To gain access to the patio, you have to check in with the people on the ground floor who would then try to radio with the people upstairs.  After 10-15 mins of back and forth and reception issues, they told us just to go upstairs and see if we can find a spot at the bar while they would keep our names on the list.  I think we could have done this on our own.  

When we arrived upstairs, to our surprise, there were plenty of open tables available. What is going on?

While we ordered the usual drinks (they were fine), the food is overpriced and lacking. We ordered this $8 caramel ice cream gelato sandwich. And get this, it was presented to us with its plastic wrapping still on.  It was as if someone walked to the gas station across the bow river, bought something from the freezer for $2 and re-sold it to us for $8.

C'mon guys. At least put some effort into this. If you're trying to go for the upscale factor, at least take the liberty to remove the plastic wrapping around the gelato sandwich.

If you want to come here, come for drinks only.  And on a full stomach."}
{"text":"The view is honestly amazing. The atmosphere is very nice with good music and great service. We had an amazing waitress who was very friendly. The burger was a decent price ($16) and it came with a side and it tasted great. The location view and food was worth every dollar. Maybe the other food isn't good but the burger was great! They also have heaters all over the patio incase it gets cold. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Not-so-hidden rooftop patio at the Simmons Building, an old mattress factory turned into the new social rendez-vous in the gentrified East Village. The building is known for housing hometown favourite coffee roasters Phil & Sebastian, the trendy Sidewalk Citizen Bakery and the more upscale charbar bar and restaurant. To get entry to the patio, you need to check-in first with the host or the hostess at the charbar counter, even if you just want to stand by the bar, and you will be put on a wait list if room isn't available. While you're waiting for the text message notifying you of the availability of a table/standing spot, have a sip at their exquisite home-crafted cocktails at the bar near the entrance!

The rooftop patio is operated during evenings by charbar, but with a grill menu adapted for rooftop cooking. Items such as DIY tacos, grilled fish and grilled vegetables are part of the more casual, shareable tapas offered on the rooftop as opposed to the regular sit-down menus. The beers and cocktails offerings are decently priced and varied, and sometimes guest chefs are even invited to wow the patrons. I had the pleasure to grab a few concoctions by a guest chef from the Natives Tongues Taqueria when I went!

As for the ambience, it's simply unexpected for such an unassuming location in Calgary. From the rooftop, amazing views of St. Patrick's Island, the sinuous Bow River and the downtown's skyline, including the Bow tower. On clear days, Bridgeland is also seen clearly from the patio. If you're on a date, make sure to grab a table near the water, or snuggle near the fireplace at the back of the patio if you dislike the Prairies' gusty winds."}

I'm not rushing back to this place. Not even for the view. 

We dropped in on a hot and sunny afternoon for a drink and to give their mexican menu a try. 

The tacos . . . sad really. $5.00 for one mini luke warm taco. No real effort went into the production of these tacos, not tasty, not well filled, nothing.  I've never been to taco time but I would think the tacos there would be better. 

The view of the river and the opportunity to people watch is great. But the expense drinks and tacos.  Not to mention the so - so service don't make me want to go back and try any other menu items.

Maybe you can get takeout at the Charbar and take it up to the rooftop :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some afternoon drinks on Sunday.  First we checked in with the hostess downstairs at Charbar and were told 20 min wait, so we had a drink at the bar downstairs first.  After 30 mins, we asked again and \"apparently\" they tried to call from upstairs but were having technical difficulties.  When we got upstairs, at least 1/3 of the tables were empty.  When we asked to sit at 1 table, they said it was reserved, yet the website says they don't take resos.  The views were definitely stunning however, as others have said.  Service however, extremely slow!!!  15 mins for waiter to come over, and another 15 mins for our drinks to arrive.  Also ordered the riblettes to munch on.  While tasty, portion size was a bit small.  Overall, come if you want to see the views, but nothing else."}
