{"text":"Had a Chicken Souvlaki meal here and honestly wasn't able to taste a thing. I know I was putting chicken, rice, a potato wedge and salad in my mouth but the taste was non-existent. Portions- huge !! To the point that it's not even appealing. Salad was fresh but the dressing was too tangy for my taste. Tzatiki was meh..... Would I try it again- No. If you want a good souvlaki meal in the area than hands down Zets is the way to go.  Staff: very kind and helpful. Very approachable. Overall- Not Impressed."}
{"text":"I have never had a better chicken shawarma before. I work nearby and discovered this place by accident. I always order the same thing- chicken shawarma plate. Their tzatziki sauce is great because it is not overpowered with garlic and it has a mellow sweetness to it. It complements that juicy and tasty chicken. Someone below said they prefer zets which is down the road- I'm 100% sure that was a troll because zets chicken is dry and bland- please give these guys a try."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but when we ate there, there was no music playing and the employees were watching a film on tv really loud and it just wasn't a pleasant experience. Something tells me they don't really care."}
{"text":"Buttered chicken shawarma was great. Server was super cheerful too :)"}
{"text":"One reviewer called Airport Gate a poor man's Zet's. Not bad, except that suggests the prices at Airport Gate are low and they're not. Average to slightly high is more accurate. But the food, sadly, doesn't compare. I order gyros on a pita. The gyros was okay but the tzatziki was weak and watery. The entire sandwich tasted like a collection of its ingredients rather than a whole thing in delicious harmony like you'd get a Zet's.  My brother ordered the chicken shawarma salad - a dish not available at Zet's. He said it was tasty enough but it was apparent that the chicken was very thinly slices, too thin, and there wasn't much of it.  While there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, it was difficult to find a table that didn't need a wipe. On the plus side, they take credit card, unlike Zet's. Overall, there's no need to come here when Zet's is just a few minutes away and the food and value is FAR better."}
{"text":"My co workers and I passed by this place frequently.  Finally we decided to give it a try. So far compared to other shawarma joints in the area that we 've tried this one is on top. Portion sizes were decent and the staff was friendly.The shawarma themselves were delicious. I think i ll be coming back for more."}
