{"text":"We had Al Mustafa cater for about 50 people and let me tell you, everyone enjoyed the meal. We had it catered for the first time from them and It was a very pleasant experience.

Veal Biryani 5/5 Chicken Qorma 5/5 Tandoori Chicken 7/5 Chana Masallah 5/5 Koya Kheer (desert was a sold out show) 10/5 Fresh Tandoori Naan 5/5 Fresh Garden Salad 5/5 (much better compared to other catering of same nature) RAITA Yogurt sauce with herbs 5/5  Food here is Halal and they also delivery the food at your location for a price."}

{"text":"Al Mustafa catering and takeout is on lakeshore in the same location where a samosa shop used to be, which is how I discovered this place looking for some samosas.   Kasim (the owner) does mostly catering for people and events and has a limited menu available daily.   Do not be put off by the lack of signage or decor - this is a catering kitchen and the food is delicious.   The portions are generous and to my mind represent great value for money.   Due to a family member being on a salt restricted diet I asked Kasim if he could prepare the food with less salt and oil and he was happy to oblige and now after my third order im happy to say the quality and taste is still great.   So far I've tried:  Tandoori chicken tikka: tasty, juicy, flavourful Nihari: not too fatty and tasty Channa Masala: small tray for $20 dollars gets you a healthy portion and it tastes like home cooked food. Chicken kabab and Beef kabab: simply delicious.  I have a standing arrangement with Kasim to Prepare a few trays weekly for my family and we have started taking his food when we go to visit family and friends and the response has been universally positive. Moreover Kasim is an absolute gentleman who takes pride in the quality and freshness of his product. I will continue to be a regular customer."}
