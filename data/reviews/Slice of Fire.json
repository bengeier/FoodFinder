{"text":"Drove past here on their opening day and we just had to stop in!

The interior of the restaurant is very clean and modern with large windows and lots of natural light, which created a nice atmosphere for us to enjoy our meal.

They have a large selection of pizzas to choose from including lots of vegetarian options which sounded delicious. Quick side note, their menu is priced so that when you pay with tax at the registrar it's a nice even number! 

For today, we opted for a medium Carnivore pizza for two people to share for $25. The pizza came out quickly despite the large crowd of people that ordered before us. 

The crust was perfectly thin and crispy, and it held up great throughout our meal. The pizza came with a generous portion of excellent quality cheese and meat. 

Overall, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The food was fantastic, and it definitely fills a demand for fresh, authentic pizza that was missing from this neighbourhood. 

However, for a medium (12\") pizza, we found the $25 price point to be a little too high. All the best to the owners of this spot! They were nothing but friendly and welcoming to everyone who came in.

4.5 stars. I'll definitely stop by again in the future to try one of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Aww. What a disappointment.  I waited month for this place to open with so much anticipation. It opened and of course I had to try it.  I ordered 2 ex-large pizzas which ran me $50. Which I don't mind paying for good pizza.  Unfortunately it wasn't very good.  The positives are they are friendly, the cheese was generous and they are timely  
The negative, I think they forgot the tomato sauce. It was literally cheese and pepperoni no tomato sauce to be found. And it was slightly under done. The grease was literally dripping off the pizza slices(yuk) I initially thought it was from the cheese which it was but also the dough was extremely greasy too.  I was so excited for an awesome pizza place to finally come to markham. Unfortunately they did not make the cut. Definitely not a good experience"}
{"text":"What a lucky find! We found this place on Yelp while we were staying at a hotel in Markham on a family vacation. Beautiful pizza shop in historic downtown Markham Village. It's a family owned shop and Hans and his family have created a gem in downtown! Wish we had looked at the menu before we ordered. They have specialties ranging from pork belly topped pizza to salmon & capers topped pizza with smoked salmon cured on spot by Hans! We loved our cheese & veggie pizza topped with complimentary house made pesto. Yum! Stop looking for other pizza joints and just go here. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Try the Ephesus vegetarian pizza with spinach, olives, sun dried tomatoes, and artichokes! 

Delicious pizza made with L O V E ! 

Welcome to Main Street Markham"}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza place on Main St Markham that isn't a regular chain. This business has been on the radar for many of the patrons in the area for a while, but the wait is finally over. 

The decor is very modern and welcoming, that of a high end pizzeria. Big open windows help light up the space and is perfect for those foodie pictures.

The staff were very welcoming and even came outside to greet passerby's and answer any questions.  Once inside you're greeted by a window of readymade slices and staff who introduce the available options and what toppings are on each slice to make your selection that much easier.

The pizzas are made and heated on a conveyor belt oven similar to ones you see in Domino's and Costco. The ingredients are incredibly fresh and the pizza is full of flavour. I opted to try the \"Carnivore\" pizza slice, and it was absolutely amazing. 

They have a variety of speciality pizzas as well, but the menu is very concise and far from overwhelming. The best part is the prices are set in a way that after tax they make up a nice round even number, saving you from fumbling for change. 

I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area and want something a little different from the standard cardboard pizza offered nearby."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza for the first time this week.   It's by far the best pizza I have ever eaten.   The staff are super friendly and the interior is clean and modern.   You can tell the ingredients are fresh, the sauce is home made and the owners truly know how to make a great pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza!  Tried the Honey Pork Belly and the Carnivore. Welcome to Main St Markham!  About time we had a top notch gourmet pizza place."}
{"text":"The name is a bit deceiving, leading the mind to think it's a wood-burning oven, but even still, the pizza is great!  I had the Hawaiian with the addition of mushrooms and devoured every bite.  It's a nice thin & crispy crust with flavour for miles :).  You can buy a hot slice from a selection of ready-pizzas or order medium or large to share. Stop in - you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try tonight and really enjoyed it! This new pizza shop is a family run business and you can tell they take pride in what they make. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are pretty big, the food is awesome and their service is just the added touch.

The location itself is fairly small with only a few tables to sit and eat. We ordered two extra large pizzas: The Aloha and Carnivore. The Aloha is their take on a Hawaiian pizza and the pineapples were fresh, not canned! The Carnivore is like their meat lovers which was also very good. You can also taste the freshness of the tomato in their marinara sauce.

One thing that did take longer was the prep/wait time of planning to dine in. It took about 20 minutes for the pizza to bake but it was well worth it. My friend who was pregnant was also offered a free slice of pizza to keep her from getting to hangry which was very friendly and generous of them.


Towards the end, they also started sampling their garlic bread which was baked with fresh shredded garlic and it was a great freebie.

I highly recommend giving them a try but do warn that their prices are a little more on the expensive side however you get what you pay for! A delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place on our way to another restaurant and decided to eat here instead - turns out it was opening day. 

They offer 22 kinds of pie (8 vegetarian) made to order, with 2 options of dessert pizza. Each pizza comes in two sizes (medium and x-large) 

We ordered the Carnivore (double smoked bacon, pepperoni, fresh sweet Italian sausage, ham, German salami, their mozzarella blend and parmigiano). 

Crust was thin but crispy, and they are generous with the amount of meat and cheese. The flavours were all there - it was very good. 

A little pricey, but we received quality ingredients and fantastic customer service."}
