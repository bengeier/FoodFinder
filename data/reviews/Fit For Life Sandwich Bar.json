{"text":"Disappointingly rude service. The one guy who wears a hat is constantly rude. He seems to hate his job and the customers who forces him to actually work.

The food is cheap but tastes cheap. I think I got sick from eating here.

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This fit for life is at the back of a news stand store.

I went in because it smelled really good from the street.

The guy in front of me was buying some sort of huge double-protein steak + chicken wrap, so I ordered the same.

It is actually pretty delicious! Good value for money. Meat very tender and juicy.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I reluctantly went here with my co-workers for lunch despite my previous bad experiences and vowed never to return.

I took advantage of their $5 daily special (as they didn't deserve any more of my money), which that day was a chicken shawarma. I asked for extra hot sauce and jalapeno peppers to remedy the blandness of their sandwiches. I gave this visit an extra star because my shawarma was actually not bad and for $5 it was cheaper than a coffee and a muffin and I didn't feel gross afterwards.

I am still dismayed by cashiers here handling food and money at the same time, both with and without gloves -- what's the point of taking off your gloves occasionally when you're going to handle both cash and food at the same time. This was done by a different staff than before, so it seems that handling food and money at the same time without a change of gloves seems to be a common practice for everyone here. I kept a good eye on the cashier so that he was not touching my food pita with his dirty hands.

I managed to snap a funny photo where the cashier was bouncing between preparing sandwiches and working the cash. He took one glove off to handle money with both hands with the gloved hand holding both paper money and the glove he just took off! Stupidity at its finest!"}
