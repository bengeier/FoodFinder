{"text":"Ordered lunch take-out yesterday with 3 other co-workers. We weren't much for variety, one of us has pad thai, and three of us had spicy noodles and chicken, all came with two spring rolls each.  Pros:  -Spring rolls are great, crispy and hot. -Spicy noodles were moderately spicy, but not overwhelming. The dish came with red pepper and green beans. -Pad thai looked okay, not too red which typically means they've loaded up on ketchup. -The food was ready fast (10 mins). -The portion was big for lunchtime!  Cons: -Please, dear lord, UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE! The hours of operation are incorrect (we called at 11, when the site said lunch starts and phone just rang and rang), the format for the lunch specials is really difficult to take in, and it just needs an overall revamp."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly service. The Pad Thai is delicious! Food and wine prices are both very reasonable. If you enjoy Thai food you will not be disappointed with this restaurant. Highly recommended. P.S. there is plenty of parking in the back and another entrance there as well, which comes in handy in winter months."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The decor and the wine list leaves something to be desired but the staff, the service, food portions and the authenticity of the cuisine is impressive.  My favourite dish hands down is the Emerald Curry Chicken, fortunately the portion is generous enough that I'm usually able to get a lunch out of it the next day. The flavour is perfection. This is definitely something I could eat every day!"}
{"text":"First time visit to Orchid Thai.  Ordered the shrimp tom yum soup which I found had lots of intense flavour, and the papaya salad which was mixed with a perfectly balanced house dressing.  Will be going back very soon to try more!"}
{"text":"Great place! Vad, the owner was very friendly and attentive to our needs and flexible with our requests to modify our orders for a vegetarian version of a curry dish as well as a toned down spice level for the golden curry chicken.  He also suggested a to start off with the lemon prawn soup - he knew what he was talking about - it was absolutely tangy and refreshing!  I will definitely go back and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really like the Thai food here. We have yet to find anywhere in the area that can compare.  One of our go to places. It's fun to go in as well since they have done an interesting job decorating with lots of authentic pieces from Thailand"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai food in York Region! Always fresh, and I eat hear 3 times a week for lunch."}
{"text":"The best thai food you will ever. It is consistently top - notch tasting food, with the friendliest staff.   The thai spring rolls, red curry and grilled chicken are too die for. And the fancy mock tails are tasty and worth the splurge for pregnant and non - drinking friends who are tired the usual drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Service is top notch as well.  Takeout portion sizes could be a tad bigger but excellent nonetheless"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and Shrimp Chips are authentic. Thai style renovation is exotic? Love it."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Richmond Hill/Aurora area; I think it is better than the two on Major Mac/Bayview area :) We had following: Fresh spring rolls: FRESH, too much carrot :S and the dipping sauce was a bit too sweet for me but it was fresh and yummy.   Golden chicken curry: everyone loved it, luckily we had some roti at home so that we could clean/wipe out all curry sauce.  Pad Thai: ok, it was good. Thai shrimp curry: I like this curry too but my parents preferred the golden chicken curry. Papaya salad: a bit too much dressing; it was tangy, a bit spicy, crunchy and very refreshing.  It is a much order item for summer.   Siamese beef: it was very favourable. The beef was marinated and came with the same dipping sauce as spring rolls."}
{"text":"My first time here. They have good and friendly service.  Tea is Ok. We enjoyed the Pad Thai we ordered.  We will come back again."}
{"text":"Our first time eating here with my family... the food was great! The freshest veggies, the nicest chicken pieces, amazing flavour and great noodles/rice. Of highest quality for sure, not your average Thai restaurant. Definitely upper lever with reasonable price! Highly recommended and our new favourite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"First time trying Orchid Thai.  Was very impressed.  Service was excellent.  My wife is allergic to shellfish and waiter was very thorough in verifying what foods may contain any shellfish in the sauce etc.  My son and daughter each had a shrimp dish (green curry and sweet & sour) -both were very tasty.  My wife and I shared two chicken dishes.  The Green Curry chicken was excellent.  The cashew chicken was decent but not anywhere as good as the green curry chicken.  Ambiance was nice. Very pleasant restaurant and we all would certainly come back again."}
{"text":"Hands Down - best Thai place in the GTA! Tastes exactly how food does in Thailand. Lunch was barely $10 for soup, spring roll and main. The main options varied of a list of over 25 ranging from coconut fish curry, pad thai, spicy beef, green chicken curry, etc.   The owner was very nice and hospitable! I loved it! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was looking for a lunch spot in Aurora today and glad to have found with the help of yelp!  Place: spacious, clean, and comfotable inside.  Adorned with lots of decor/photos from Thailand inside, like a 'museum's as the shop owner described it.  The plaza it's in looks a bit small/old from the outside, but step inside and you will be pleasantly surprrised.  Food/Price: great value!  Lunch menu meant for weekdays was still offered on the weekend, many choices for $10.95 and comes with soup and spring rolls.  Portion sizes are good and food tastes good.  We got the green curry chicken, tamirand curry beef, pad thai, and chicken skewers app.  My fav was the green curry chicken!  Too bad no Thai Iced Tea or Thai Coffee today, I wanted the mango sticky rice for dessert but it was not in season.  Service:  staff was very friendly and personable.  Overall a great dining experience and I would come back again when in the Aurora area."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant boasts an authentic taste, ambiance and nature that does Thailand proud. This restaurant is so good I had to write a review even though I'm living in Australia. It's always the first place we go when I fly in.  Lunch is a steal with a soup, springroll, and main dish for only $9.95. You will often find yourself waited on by the owner himself who I've never seen without his full face grin.   Spicy tofu is a favourite of mine and a dish that I have never been able to find duplicated anywhere else. The pad thai is divine as is the mango salad, chicken cashew nut, green curry, panang curry.... okay, I must say I've never had anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.....hands down the best coconut rice. Service was prompt and courteous. Restrooms were spotless. Overall an excellent dining experience!!"}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant is designed to be tropical style, cozy environment really makes feel like you are dinning in Thailand. Their customer service is also great, considering it was our first time there, they have recommended lots of options in details. I personally am not a big fan of Thai food, there is that strange taste within the food which I dislike about, maybe that is why I am kind of disappointed at the food there, to be honest I think that the raking is a little too high for the actual quality.  I am not a competitor, lies are unacceptable!!! this review is written after my experience at the place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nicely decorated and people there were super friendly. Our order arrived quickly, though the place was almost empty as we came for early dinner. We had Thai spring rolls, mango salad, Tom Yam Goong and Seafood soups, red curry with shrimp, and beef with oyster sauce. Everything was excellent, in fact it was one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. Will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with my friends last night. I didn't have much experience with Thai food before so I was a bit skeptical... However, the pad thai and the beef (can't remember exact name) was delicious! The jasmine rice we ordered on the side made a nice addition. Also, the waitress was polite and friendly. It was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We had the mango salad, shrimp rolls, vegetable curry and beef tamarind curry. All were really yummy."}
{"text":"There are many Thai option in Newmarket and Aurora and this is one of my favourites.  The family that runs this shop is very attentive and sweet.   I always opt for the lunch menu $11.99 and it comes with an entree, a spring roll and a hot and sour soup.   I had the pad thai - which I believe is authentic. It is the perfect balance of sweet and sour. You can really taste the authentic-ness from the wok fried pad thai.   Hands down they have some of the best spring rolls as well :)   I sometimes also get the red curry with chicken and rice which is flavourful as well. The dish is a blend of curry and coconut milk - delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise once you walk in the door. The ambiance and food is well worth it! Was very comparable to food we had in thailand"}
{"text":"This is not an update; this is a response to the owner's comment on my original review. The claims made in the owner's comment are false and misleading. I have never been associated with any of Orchid Thai's competitors at any point in time (except perhaps as a customer) and have never emailed the business.   In fact, I received a message via Yelp from the owner on July 3rd, 2017, offering me a free dinner of my choice to potentially change my mind. He also requested my address to send me a gift card. I would never release my address to anyone online; and most importantly, I refuse to accept a free meal/bribe in exchange for a good review. I did not respond to that message.   I intend to protect my rights to post truthful and valid reviews of my particular experience with this and other businesses on Yelp, and I will not be removing my review. I hope in the future the owner can take the constructive criticism from guests without resorting to any further lies and attempts at defamation."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Real authentic in flavour!  The pad thai is my fav here and i usually get them to cook it with green curry sauce for a kick! Love! Beef basil is wonderful also.  Lunch special is a good deal ends at 3 pm. Includes a spring roll n soup. Around $9  Owner is pleasant along with rest of staff.  Call for pick up 20 min advance.   Def try! You won't regret!"}
{"text":"It's ok.. nothing compared to Toronto Thai food. Quite expensive as well for what you get ie Thai grilled chicken was $13 and it consisted of half a pounded out chicken breast on the grill. Tom yum soup was up to standards, not really spicy at all. One and done."}
{"text":"After being to Thailand it is hard to find a place that compares in both food quality and customer service. This place has nail it. From the authentic food to the friendly staff this place is wonderful."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in town!  My family absolutely devours the crab fried rice and pad Thai. I can never decide between my favourites (Green Curry and eggplant). The owner and host are always accommodating and welcoming.  Headed there for dinner now!"}
{"text":"We got the pad Thai here and fresh spring rolls and it was absolutely delicious! The decor was a little over done but regardless, the food and service were amazing."}
{"text":"There are so many good Asian restaurants around York region, but this one is a cut above.  When you first walk in the door, you can't help but be struck by the level of decor.  It is not high-end, just oozing with personality and charm that augments the experience.  I started with the Lemon Shrimp soup, on another recommendation.  Its light flavourful broth with perfectly cooked shrimp were gone in no time.  The main dish was the mixed seafood basil, a dish pleasing to both the eyes and the palette.  The seafood was perfectly cooked, which is really the only thing that must be correct with seafood (other than freshness), but the sauce was amazing!  Service was friendly and attentive, the whole experience was great.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT. Every time we go there we end up stuffing ourselves because their curries are so darn delicious.   Interesting, exotic atmosphere and very nice people working there. Take-out is quick and delish with fair size portions for the price.   Favourites include fish Thai curry, beef with oyster sauce and ginger chicken.   Only downside is they close quite early. Wish we could sneak in a Thai fix a bit later in the evening when we have an Orchid Thai craving!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I love the lunch specials, pad Thai, soup and spring roll is my usual.  We order there once or twice a month, they never get it wrong.  Tried the Basil beef, the mixed seafood and the shrimp fried rice.  They have lots to choose from, the owner, and chef are extremely polite, the staff always has a smile and they are happy to answer questions at anytime.  Call in over the phone for pickups and they have the food ready in 20 mins or less! What I like best about this place is the consistency of the food's quality.  I have tried  other Thai food  spots in Aurora and it was a hit and miss or they always mess our orders up, however at Orchid Thai, we ordered over 20 times over the last 2.5yrs always yummy.  They even make a special for my 3 yr old who likes just plain veggies and shrimp."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good in Orchid Thai. My faves are Chicken and Shrimp Basil, Shrimp and Cashew Nuts, Pad Thai, and Curry dishes. They have lunch specials that come with soup and spring roll. Servers are very nice and cheery."}
{"text":"First off I want to start by saying I was with a large group of people. Food was amazing, came out very quickly, very tasty and the meats where juicy with some great sauces. Most importantly it was all well cooked and hot. Staff was incredibly friendly always asking if we needed anything else and checking up on us. Would definitely recommend to anyone likes Thai, or is trying it for the first time. Will definitely go back again with more friends"}
{"text":"This restaurant sets a standard for how I rate all Thai restaurants.  It is by far one of my favourites.  Clean bathrooms.  Friendly knowledgable staff.  Healthy food.  Pleasant establishment, with lots of artistic work done inside.  Beautiful dishes and cutlery.  Prompt service.  I had the basil pork tonight.  Normally this would be basil chicken or beef, but they have made this special for me.  I also had the coconut soup.  It was delicious and spiced well.  Lots of vegetables, and attention to freshness.  I've been coming for over 14 years now to this restaurant, and have had parties here as well.  Never disappointed and always treated very pleasantly."}
{"text":"This is a popular restaurant in Aurora. The food is delicious, well presented and fresh.  Doesn't taste heavy.   I had the spicy vegetable with tofu. And my partner had a  coconut curry with shrimp. Both dishes were excellent. We started off with vegetarian spring rolls. They were ok, nothing special.  The service is efficient and friendly.  Decor has a heavy Thai theme.  Pricing is creeping up. I would recommend Orchid Thai for delicious Thai dishes."}
{"text":"My first time at Orchid Thai Restaurant and I believe it may be my favourite over Chinese Food.  Atmosphere is relaxing, staff very friendly and helpful with menu selection. Both chicken curry and beff stir fry where delicious, each having their own marriage of flavours. Spring rolls were fresh and crispy.   There is nothing like the feeling when you have eaten good food and you are salivating for next time."}
{"text":"Has turned into one of my favourite go to takeout restaurants.  Previously, I use to go to Thai Basil, but as they've become too expensive I find myself going more to Aurora now.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Orchid Thai is the Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to, great service, friendly staff, great tasty foods, highly recommended, you must try their pad thai, spicy noodles, red beef curry, coconut fish curry.  Will defiantly go back there again soon!!"}
{"text":"Returned after 3 years and was pleasantly surprised , I truly enjoyed the experience . Spring rolls are crunchy and delicious, shrimps good size and decent portion  , and tasted really good. Service was attentive , decor as always very cosy ."}
{"text":"The owner had the audacity to tell me I must have given the 4-Star review by mistake and that I should correct it to 5-Star.  WTF???  Really?  You know what? I did make a mistake.  You're a 1-Star scrap show for telling me how I should rate you.  You should have kept your trap shut and be happy you had a 4-Star and keep striving for a 5.  Screw you, you lost a customer.  Now I get a message that he doesn't need customers like me and that he'll sue me for defamation.  Good luck.  I didn't defame you at all, I told the truth of what you said and you go off the rails on me? Do people really want to support business owners who behave this way?  Not me."}
{"text":"This is a lovely and very authentic Thai restaurant, ambiance of pictures and cute paraphanelia give a lovely atmosphere. Service is very quick and dishes are priced reasonably $8-$13 with excellent, fresh dishes. Favorites are: Pad Thai, Basil chicken and green vegetable stir fry. Dessert is meh, but everything else is fab, highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"One of the better oriental restaurants in the north GTA.   Staff made the experience extremely enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came in to try the Chicken Penang which is one of my favourite Thai dish . Their version is not as sweet as the ones you get from other Canadianized restaurants and it has a generous portion of veggies , creamy blend of coconut sauce and a bit of a kick from spices. Feels very Homey and the chicken tasted really fresh. Would recommend for anyone that wants a nice relaxing place to eat with family or friends."}
{"text":"Been here on a number of occasions. The atmosphere and the decor are fantastic.  Food always comes hot and fresh and consistently delicious. Red curry chicken, and mango salad are must haves. Reasonably priced and always leave happy."}
