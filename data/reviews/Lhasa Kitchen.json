{"text":"I first tried Lhasa Kitchen because it's the closest of the Tibetan restaurants to me, but it's never disappointed! Chicken chili with gravy, bean datsi, and beef momos are my usual order (enough for 2 to 3 people!)."}
{"text":"We were wandering Parkdale, looking for Indian food, and were steered toward 1422 Queen St. by a local. I was hurriedly checking Yelp on my phone and this address showed up as an Indian restaurant?? Instead, we were greeted with the warm colours of Tibet, a culture which seems to be saturating that little disheveled strip of Queen. Right across the the big liquour store, it's easy to find, yet was unlisted on Yelp. How cool was that?! When I asked how long they had been open, our young server said, a year. Whoa, interesting. 
One of our group of 4 asked about gluten-free options, a question that was met with genuine puzzlement. I knew right there that this was gonna be a treat! How refreshing.
I asked about their signature Tibetan dish, and she said the dumplings but then she warned that it would take 20 minutes to make them as they were made fresh to order only. Fantastic! Now you have my full attention. In no time we had a table full of delicious food, all interesting, and all new to my palette. See my pics, wonderful! 
She warned against the salty/savoury butter tea, as many don't bother drinking it, and suggesting the lassi instead as it would go with the food. We were served up thick and flavourful MANGO lassis. Now that's a treat! The straw stood proud when slipped in the yogourty goodness and the flavour was rich and creamy. And trust me, you do need the cool comfort of the lassi when eating their dishes. They all have chilies so careful of biting into them, they kick ass!
And the hot sauce, more of a hot sauce paste, was incredibly hot as well, worth trying for sure.
The fresh made dumplings were amazing with the al dente (chewy), doughy outside and the juicy beef inside. They offer most dishes with beef, pork, or veg, but for some reason our chosen dishes were all beef based. Regardless, this is a must-try spot in Parkdale.
The family feeling here is genuine and through-to-the-bone, as they make sure you're doing ok and a farewell is sure to make you feel the experience as you leave. Our table of four received a bill of only $45 so make sure you overtip to help keep them in business. Hate to see them pack it in due to low cash flow. Highly recommended in Parkdale!"}
{"text":"We walked by this restaurant and saw the menus posted up front, which was convenient since we compared it to another restaurant next door that also had menus posted up and decided to go to this place because the prices looked better.

It was 5 PM and the place was completely empty. It's a small restaurant, with seating for about 20. They have two tables up front by the windows, which provide a great view of the LCBO across the street. There are decorations along the walls, and books on tibetan culture available for your use while you're waiting for food to be prepared. There's a TV near the back, with various music videos playing including some tibetan dances and buddhist chanting.

They've got one washroom in the basement. The entrance to the basement is hidden behind a large curtain. However, right behind the curtain, is the door, which may be closed. Of course, you won't know there's a door there because it's hidden by the curtain! So if you're used to just walking through these kinds of things, make sure you stick your hand in front. It is also a stairway down into pitch black darkness, which is quite interesting to see. You should definitely check it out when the light's turned off.

The menu provides a decent variety of options. We were wondering what were some more tibetan options and ended up getting some momo's, shabhaley, and a bhutanese dish called \"Phak Sha Paa\" which was pork belly with radish, marinated in a number of different ingredients.

You can hear them cooking your food in the kitchen. This may be in part due to the lack of customers so making food as they are ordered makes more sense. In any case, be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your food.

Between the four of us, we shared 10 cooked momo's, 10 fried momo's, 4 shabhaley, and a plate of pork belly. The momo's were good: generous amount of meat inside. Shabhaley was not as crispy as I thought it would be, but it was still pretty good.

The pork belly was disappointing. There was a picture at the back of the menu that showed a nice large plate of pork belly, but when it came out, we realized there were only 4 slices of pork belly, and the rest was radishes. And this was one of their more expensive dishes at 10.99! It tasted alright, but definitely would pick something else.

When you're paying the bill, they take cash, credit and debit. But they also take apple pay if you prefer something more modern. They'll also split your bills no problem.

Overall, it's a nice place if you have time to sit and eat."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place has yellow laphing. It's super spicy but it's so good. Their momos are also one of the best in Parkdale. I also had the mixed vegetables which was good too. Good value for quality food."}
{"text":"Having become a big fan of Himalayan food, I already had Lhasa Kitchen bookmarked on Yelp, but then I read that it is the only place in Toronto to get Bhutanese food, so it became my destination for an early dinner this past Tuesday. The restaurant only has seating for about 20 people, but is pretty spacious and bright inside. There are a few pictures and decorations on the walls, with a predominant orange and brown theme. The service was fine, even a little reserved perhaps. I was told upon ordering that it would be about 15min for the momos, but my other dish arrived in about half that time. There is a TV there, but it was playing music videos (of Himalayan singers perhaps, certainly not the MTV kind) while I was there, which provided some nice background music.

One page of the menu has all the Bhutanese food, and that was my first destination. I chose the Shamo Datsi, a delicious bowl of mushrooms with chili and cheese, with rice on the side. The mushrooms were mostly large slices, and the sauce was really thick with large pieces of green chili, which made it a little hotter than I expected. I am not sure what the rice was prepared with, but it was flavourful on its own. For momos, I ordered the steamed vegetable, which were well-stuffed with carrots and cabbage and peas. They were just a bit stiff and very good also, and the chili sauce that came with them was again rather hot.  As always, I ended my meal with a cup of butter tea. A lot of the menu is similar to other Tibetan restaurants along Queen West: curries, noodle soups, a meat or veg thali platter; many of the Bhutanese dishes are similar to what I had with different meat or vegetables in cheese and chili/tomato/onion.

My total bill was $20 for a lot of really good food, so definitely a strong recommendation. While I quite enjoyed the spiciness of both my dishes, it may not be for everyone, and I wondered if it was only my choices or if all of their food is hot. I guess I'll find out, since I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I noticed that there were a number of Tibetan restaurants in the parkdale area, so decided to try one with some friends and we just ended up stumbled upon Lhasa. The restaurant is small, non-descript and we were the only ones there. However, the servers were extremely friendly, service was great and everything seemed truly authentic.

Tibetan cuisine is a unique experience and Lhasa tasted very authentic. I've been to Bhutan and travelled in Asia, so I recognized many of the flavors. We ordered a chicken curry, momos (dumplings), chili cheese pork. I highly recommend all of the dishes, so much flavor with everything. The chilies are quite spicy and warning, they might not be what you expect (lots of chopped whole chilies, not like the western dish).

If you're looking for an authentic taste of Tibetan cuisine, look no further!"}
{"text":"Me and a group of my Yelp friends literally stumbled upon Lhasa Kitchen while browsing on Yelp to look for a quick dinner spot before our Yelp Elite event later that night. We were impressed by Martin S.' review of the restaurant (also congrats on the ROTD!), which led to us giving Lhasa Kitchen a try. 

Environment:
Having no experience being in the Parkdale neighbourhood before, I was allured by its local charm and the small businesses along the Queen West. Lhasa Kitchen was located near the Queen West/Lansdowne intersection, and it was easily accessible by street car. For those who drive, there were also paid street parking as well, though similar to other downtown streets, the roads were quite narrow with only 2 lanes. 
The restaurant was quite small and could probably only accommodate 5 individual groups of diners. We were here on a Tuesday for dinner and the place was quite empty, with only 1 other table besides us and some take-out orders. The d√©cor definitely reflects the Tibetan culture with colourful quilts for table cloth and Tibetan music playing in the background. It was funny because it was playing Tibetan pop music for a little while at the beginning, but for the most part of our meal it was playing a repetitive Buddhist temple music lol.

Food:
Lhasa Kitchen was a family-owned business that served Tibetan food, a cuisine that I have never been exposed to before, so I was in for a ride. Taking recommendations from Martin's review, we ordered both the steamed and deep-fried Beef Momo (Dumpling), a Beef Patty dish, and a Pork Belly with White Radish dish for the 4 of us to share. 
The Beef Momo was definitely the must-have at Lhasa Kitchen. The portion was large with 10 Momos per order and the beef was super juicy with great flavours. I personally preferred the deep-fried Momos more. 
The Beef Patty basically used the same type of beef that was in the Momos, but I found the shell to be too stiff and a little difficult to chew. 
The Pork Belly with White Radish dish was disappointing, as there were only 4 slices of pork bellies, and the rest were just white radish. However, the flavour was good and its spiciness was perfect for eating with rice. 

Service:
The service was quite slow due to it being a family-owned restaurant with approximately 2 people running the restaurant. It took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive at our table. I did like that the server/owner didn't bother us very often when we ate and she only came over periodically to refill our water. 

Overall, Lhasa Kitchen is a good restaurant to try if you're looking for a cheap dine-out, as our bill came down to about $12 per person with tax and tips included. The flavours were good and it opened my eyes to Tibetan cuisine."}
{"text":"I love their food and services is always top.I really enjoying their juicy momos:) the server was very young and sincere about their services"}
