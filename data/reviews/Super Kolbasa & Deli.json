{"text":"Super Kolbasa has all the standbys of a Polish deli: kolbasa (of course), rye bread, sauerkraut, and the rest of those eastern European goodies you might be looking for. It's old school, too, in the sense that they haven't diversified into non-Polish foods: for instance, there are noodles, but only Polish noodles.  My only real complaint is that, in a predominantly Polish neighbourhood, a Polish deli doesn't exactly stand out. I suppose that it's not exactly fair that Super Kolbasa does get a little lost in the shuffle for me. They're worth a look, especially when Benna's down the street gets to be too much of a zoo."}
{"text":"Good luck getting served if you don't speak polish. There's a very clear hierarchy here. Despite this, I  Will wait for the home smoked village sausage. This isn't your generic gristly kielbasa Get it when its still warm. Peel off the casing and dip in it some spicy kozliks mustard. yum"}
{"text":"5/5 for value. Very tasty schnitzels and soup. The meat on a stick is also supremely tasty. Go to the Keg if you looking for amazing service, check out Super Kielbasa if you want some great grub!!  Tip - they sell these mushroom dumplings (look like mini pierogies). Grab a dozen and heat them in your soup for a truly delicious experience. With a meat on the stick you're set."}
{"text":"SUUUUUPER KOLBAAAAASA!  come on...when you see the name, don't you just want to shout it this way with extra exclamation marks?!   I like this place, and perhaps their items do not spectacularly stand out amongst others in the area, however, I still do like their prepared foods, including their deli salads...they have this one pasta with sausage and sauerkraut that is oh so greasy but tasty and filling in a homey nostalgic sort of way...which is funny cuz I never grew up eating polish food...but that said, it reminds me of my university meals, what better quick meal then cooked noodles with cut up sausages, onions and lots of pepper?  ohhh and now....now i'm intrigued by the explanation of these chocolate cream fudges by kim b!  ...i'll look for them on my next trip there!"}
{"text":"I live near this place and come here at least once a week. It has prepared food for take out. They always have lots of fresh soups made that day or the day before. My favourite soups are the pickle soup (a Polish classic), and the tomato soup.   They have tons of food to choose from and it's all very cheap. Schnitzels (chicken and pork), chicken/pork sticks, crockets (sauerkraut or chicken), meat balls, sausages, chicken, fish, bigos (a polish cabbage stew - vegetarian or meat), coleslaw, beet salads, different pasta salads, pierogies (cheddar, cottage cheese, cheddar jalapeno, meat, sauerkraut, and sometimes fruit), cakes, deserts, polish preserves, juices, and many more things!   The polish ladies who work there are all so cute and nice. Also very fast and efficient. This place only takes cash so make sure you go to the ATM before. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for cheap, lunch/dinner, Polish, prepared, hot and cold food :)"}
{"text":"Great cooked sausages and Salisbury streaked with onions.  2/$5.    Wish I brought more $ as I was just in the area for an appt & only had $10.   The lady said you have enough as their is no tax on it so I ended up with 2 Salisbury steaks  & 2 sausages with fried onions.  Delish !"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE IN TORONTO... Go to one of the other butchers in Roncie if you prefer good friendly service!   The women that work at this place are heinously rude. They treat everyone who comes in like they're a burden and do nothing but roll their eyes at people and say insulting things about their customers in polish. They don't realize... Just because I don't order in polish, doesn't mean I don't speak it...   Don't go to this place unless you wish to be humiliated to your face in another language. If you speak polish/Ukrainian/Slovak... Go in for a good laugh to see how a bad business is truly run..."}
{"text":"Having had some time to explore our new neighbourhood, I can confidently say that Super Kolbasa & Deli is the best place to buy prepared Polish food in the area.  Sure, some of the other spots on Roncesvalles will lure you in with a bigger selection of grocery items and baked goods (lamb-shaped Easter cakes, anyone?), but they really can't be beat for staples such as cabbage rolls (the best, but lacking in any kind of sauce - you'll have to add your own if you need some), pierogi, pork cutlets, and traditional sides, such as potato salad, beet salad, coleslaw, sauerkraut, and a variety of soups.  Everything is charged by weight, and the lovely ladies behind the counter will sometimes throw something in for free if the wind blows in the right direction.  Be warned, it is cash only, and it can take them a bit of time to get some items out into the food counter.  Sometimes their cabbage rolls aren't ready until 11-11:30am, so for best selection, don't go just as they're opening."}
{"text":"Super food! This place is absolutely perfect for weeknight meals when you don't feel like cooking much. In addition to great home-style Polish foods ready to take away, they also have a decent little selection of other items like sour cream, herring, cheese, and jarred items. Everything is 25-50% less expensive than any big brand grocery store in the area. Don't be put off by the lack of posted hours or the not-friendly service - they aren't tying to be terse. That's seriously just how service in Poland is. They're just not interested in sucking up to the consumer, but they are interested in helping you. Just point and ask and they'll help you right away - I'm sure they need to get people in and out pretty quick to earn enough profit to pay rent on Roncy. I don't speak a word of Polish and it's always fine. Food is either labeled in English it pretty obvious Only suckers pay double for boring food (and so-so service) at Sobey's up the road."}
{"text":"You want to snicker at the name, well at least I do, but this truly is a super store.   It sells what you'd expect; perogies, borsct, and yes, kolbasa but I go for a more delicious treat. Something you wouldn't expect.  They sell these little bags of candy there and on a whim I once bought a bag of candies in brown and white wrappers with a cow on them labeled \"Chocolate Cream Fudge\" trademark \"ZPC-Milanowek Poland\".   I expected a tough-gotta-work-at-it kind of candy but oh I was so wrong. It was sort of soft but with a little crunchy and then gooey fudgy inside. I ate another and another and even now as I write this, my desk is littered with wrappers of candies come and gone.   I am hooked. DAMN YOU SUPER KOLBASA!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim and came back for seconds! Amazing, amazing food--tried the giant potato pancakes, sauerkraut with mushrooms, pickle soup, yes PICKLE soup! What else.... oh yes, PIEROGIES!  Super Kolbasa is indeed quite super and so were the three Polish women working behind the counter. We were taking food to go for a picnic and they made sure we were all set with utensils and napkins :) Will be back to try EVERYTHING else!"}
{"text":"As winter sets in, my household diet has thinned down to almost exclusively root vegetables and Super Kolbasa offerings. It's *totally fine*!   This little shop of the Polish Pantheon has made life a warm haze of cabbage and pork, dappled with sparkling kefir and double-smoked garlic polish sausage (which is truly delicious).   The treatment here is a no nonsense kind of place. Everything is good - just point and shoot. It will cost about $12 for a big bag of food, so always buy in liters  - you can eat a lot more sauerkraut than you think if you don't have anything else!"}
{"text":"As much as I love the food here I will NOT be returning due to the disatisfying customer service from one individual. I just got home from a quick stop in the store and upon my checkout the lady at the cash tried to rip me off - I am actually extremely upset with the way she handled the situation as she was in the wrong - typical stubbornnes from an older lady. I counted my money to double check it was not an error on my part but everything balanced out (after she gave me my correct change).   You need to update your phone number as I can't even call the store to voice my concerns to the manager so that this doesn't happen to anyone else!"}
