{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at VBC. I went with a group of friends for dinner on a cool summer night. We sat on the patio, which is really quite nice.  Our waitress was ok. She didn't tell us about any specials up front, and when we asked, we weren't particularly blown away by them anyway. She also seemed unsure of what kind of soup they had. I think she was maybe adjusting to using a tablet to take orders. Whatever happened to writing them down?!  Started with some beers and the chips and beer cheese dip. The appetizer was warm and flavorful. They were out of several beers, which the waitress listed so quickly that I forgot which ones they were and tried to order two of said beers. None the less, I eventually got the hibiscus saison, which was a beautiful color, dry, and bubbly. I really wish that they offered a tasting flight, but I didn't see it on the menu anywhere. Everyone else in the group seemed to enjoy their beer choices too, but it would have been nice to sample them before ordering.  I had a chicken wrap and tots. Loved the tots! Nice and crispy, and well-seasoned. The chicken wrap was a bit unbalanced in its assembly-- lots of lettuce in one half, chicken in the other. Still, it was really tasty, just required some reconfiguring.  We lingered on the patio near the end of the night (a Tuesday) and I didn't feel as though our waitress was really laying pressure on us to leave, which is nice. As a former waitress, I can appreciate wanting to get out of work on time! They sort of cleaned up around us, but let us wrap up in our own time.  Overall a pleasant experience!  EDIT: I was back at Vintage and now they offer \"flights\" in the form of sampling glasses. There's no set amount you have to get, and each glass is $1.50, unless it's over 7% alcohol, then it's $2."}
{"text":"Let's face it: you probably go here for the beer rather than the food (which is not bad--solid bar fare).  Everyone at my table enjoyed their food.  The stroganoff was highly recommended, as was the tiger burger and the chicken pot pie...but I haven't personally tried them, so I can't vouch for 'em.  I had the hilarious idea that I'd go light and order soup, so I opted for the white chicken chili (it SOUNDS light, right?!). It turned out to be a roux-based, cream-laden, sour cream and cheese-bedecked stew that--while being very tasty--was undoubtedly in the quadruple digits for calories.  The beer though.  Woodshed IPA....yum."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience with the Vintage that I have to share!  I ate there about a month ago with my mom and I had the chicken & waffles.  We had shared an appetizer, so I didn't actually get around to eating the waffles until I got home.  The waffles were really bad.  One bite was almost entirely baking powder, so the batter had not been properly mixed or something.  Anyway, I emailed the Vintage to let them know.  Later that week I got an email from the chef - he apologized and acknowledged the problem.  Additionally, he told me that my email had led him to totally rethink the dish and that if I wanted to come back and try the new version - it would be on the house.  I just tried the new and improved chicken & waffles and I have to say they are the BEST I've ever had!  The new waffles are Belgian style and the chicken breading has been made slightly sweeter, more crunchy and lighter in color.  It seemed like the thigh meat had been cut thinner than before too, so the breading / meat ratio was higher.  The gravy was not thick anymore - it was sweeter and more buttery; a dramatic improvement!  If you've been disappointed by the C&W here before - now might be a good time to try again."}
{"text":"I am really surprised that this restaurant doesn't have a higher rating.  My husband and I go here all the time and we have never had a bad meal.  I would recommend all of their burgers, the pot roast balls and the chicken and waffles.  Their fries are also really good although i'm not sure if they're made in house or not.  Of the appetizers I've tried, the irish nachos and the cheese curds, neither was all that great but one time they were running poutine and that was awesome.  I feel like this is the one of the best (less expensive) restaurants in Madison and I like that they serve both burgers and sandwiches and actual entres.  Also food has always been served to us in a timely fashion which is nice when you arrive hungry."}
{"text":"The good: their fries are amazing. I probably had a pound of them on my plate-of which I, embarrassingly and in a glutton filled blur, ate in it's entirety. Thick cut potato fries with a sound, but not excessive level of seasoning. Well done.   The Bad: cheese curds. These were a waste of about $9. The largest cheese curd was smaller than a marble. Save yourself $6 and grab some from Culver's.   The bottom line: solid sandwich and burger menu. Outdoor dining. Overall ok-ish food that'll be tasty at the moment but leave you feeling a bit disgusting and filled with regret about 20 min later."}
{"text":"Very good burgers; great shepherd's pie. But other dishes hit or miss. They try too hard with their salads, and just put too much stuff on them for my taste. I ordered what I thought was going to be a \"chicken salad\" recently. What I got was a chunk of grilled romaine And and whole, crustily breaded chicken cutlet with some other stuff.....not what I wanted at all, menu could be clearer. But great for big groups, good beer, fun atmosphere. But stick to the burgers!"}
{"text":"the stroganoff is AMAZING....I would have never ordered it, but our server recommended it.  (It doesnt say it on the description, but it is finished with truffle oil=YUM)... The flavors are so complex and delicious!  Cannot say enough good things about it. Highly recommend it :) also their 'trepidation' beer is quite good too.  Other people in our party liked the Mac & Cheese, Pork Chop with Sweet Potatoes, and the Fish Tacos.  Meatloaf was ok.  Overall, cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was excited when this place opened, the west side needed a cool hang out bar. Unfortunately out of the four times that I have been there, I have been disappointed.   The bartenders do not know how to make their special drinks, one bartender forgot to add the cranberry to the cosmo, which another bartender noticed and fixed. On other occasions a few of us ordered some of the other special drinks, such as the champagne drinks, again, less than desirable.  The one time we went to try their beer, since it had finally been brewed, we ended up walking out because the waitor straight up ignored us for 25 minutes and as we were walking out he caught up to us in the parking lot and started yelling for us to come back.  The food sounds impressive on the menu, but its not.  For the price I would rather drive over to the Great Dane in Hilldale/Fitchburg.  We will continue to frequent Babes for drinks instead of the Vintage.   The vintage has potential and I hope that they correct the various issues."}
{"text":"Best burger ever!!! Beef tasted like it was ground fresh that day. Awesome service cool classic vintage gastropub vibe!!! Definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"This place blows. The service and the people who run the place suck and don't believe in customer service. The only reason I ever go is to meet somebody and the last two times I've been there I've left very unsatisfied and complaining to the manager. Again, the service absolutely sucks and the managers are never willing to step in a make things right. I hate this place and don't recommend giving them your business."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good replacement for JT Whitney's, this is not it, at least from a non-alcoholic standpoint.  The menu is average at best--typical American fare at a brewpub.  The brewer's root beer and ginger soda were \"meh\" at best.  My party ordered 3 entrees--the shephard's pie, the chicken caesar salad, and 3 orders of the fish and chips.  The shepard's pie was bland and gravy-dominated.  The caesar salad was unremarkable and the ingredients weren't fresh--the roasted red peppers were straight out the can.   The fish and chips were the worst part of the story.  We ordered the fish and chips and were asked what sides we'd like.  We were confused as to whether we were getting an additional side (other than the chips, which are in fact french fries, which every sane person knows and is what the menu says).  We were told no, that there was only one side.  Ok, we said, we'd like the chips.  The fish showed up with  . . . potato chips.  Really?  When we politely tried to explain that we had ordered the fish and chips, the person who brought out the food (who wasn't our server) got very defensive and said \"well, you ordered the chips\", but brought us a basket of underwhelming fries for free.  I'm not sure where the miscommunication or misunderstanding happened, but it was odd.    The best part of the meal was the side salad that came with the shepard's pie, which was actually quite good.  The customer service was average at best.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"VBC is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  We were regulars at Vintage downtown and when we grew out of the college crowd we graduated to Vintage Brewing Company on Whitney Way.  The drinks are great, food is even better.  TONS of gf/vg options; very appropriate for Madison.    Personal fave:  homemade black bean burger!  (You'll thank me)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, tasty beer, and delicious, reasonably priced comfort food. The Hibiscus Saison was the perfect antidote for the summer heat. We split the Big Sky Burger, which was super tasty, and the tator tots with truffle oil (which was worth the extra $1.75."}
{"text":"Great beers and good services but not impressed with the foods. Friends both ordered the Friday special fish fries, and I the fish tacos. They turned out basically the same thing except mine was on soft tacos with some oddly-flavored coleslaw (with miso dressing?). Fish was flavorless and too much breading. Tots and soups tasted good. I might go back just for the beers and try burgers next time."}
{"text":"Had a great pastrami sandwich with sidewinder fries for lunch, washed down with two pretty good ales. Good, attentive waitress made things even better. I'd definitely go again, and recommend it to anyone looking for a casual lunch with good beer."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Creative and well executed. Chicken and waffles and sweet potato chestnut burger were unreal. This could be a new favorite. Except...  Awful service. We had to ask twice for multiple things, so many of which should be obvious (refill empty water glasses.) since it took so long, we asked for our bills as soon as our food arrived. When our server returned, we asked her to stay so we could give her our cards. She turned and walked away for 10 minutes. This is in a nearly empty restaurant. It took an hour and a half to eat lunch on a Wednesday at 1 pm.  Great place if you have lots of time. If you have the patience of a saint, you will be rewarded with superb food. Otherwise, you should go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let's just say this. That damn Popper burger was so friggen good, I have never inhaled food so fast in my life. I made the bar atmosphere uncomfortable with the carnage that took place while I was taking bite after bite without even allowing time for my previous bite to get masticated and eaten.   It's been 20 minutes since I took my last victory bite, and despite my very full and uncomfortable body I am one happy human.   Quality beef. Quality ingredients. Quality workers. Amazing experience"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner and evening.  The private room was great for my brother's Wedding Rehearsal dinner.  We had a good time tasting the beers at our own private bar.  I enjoyed the different brews I tasted and ended up with a pint of the Hibiscus Saison.  It was nice and refreshing on a hot and humid night.  Dinner was yum yum.  I had the BBQ Beef Brisket.  Never had Brisket before and it was so good.  Nice balance of BBQ sauce and meat.  The corn was a little over cooked and think if it were later in the summer the corn would be better.  Service was great, friendly bartender and server."}
{"text":"\"I don't wanna talk down about the place. The beer is good, the place is good, but the stroganoff sucks dick\" - Nate T."}
{"text":"busy place on a friday night.  had their scaredy cat oatmeal stout, and it was very smooth.  i would have had a couple more if i wasn't planning on eating a lot of food.  their house made fried cheese curds were definitely fresh, and probably the highlight of the meal.  my girlfriend got the homemade beef stroganoff, and raved about it.  i got the bacon wrapped meatloaf, and i was a bit disappointed. it was probably 2-3 days old.  it was cut thin, and the meat itself was very dark and near dry.  the green bean side was cooked perfectly, and i can tell they use fresh produce and vegetables.  i would go back, but i would stick more to beer flights and appetizers."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and there was a 15 minute wait which I thought was a good sign.  I had a burger and my husband had the pulled pork. The burger was nothing memorable. It was unevenly cooked and had too much black pepper.  The tomato slice served with it also had a green center and was not ripe.  I know it is a small detail, but I expect a better tomato when paying $10 for a burger.  The pulled pork was room temperature and a bit spicy.  Our server was friendly. My husband was brought the wrong side dish, but the tater tots were better than the fries anyway.  I might go back here for a beer and appetizer on the patio, but I wouldn't go back for lunch."}
{"text":"We took a group of 8 (with 3 kids under the age of 8) here as a last minute thing on New Year's Day.  We sat in the bar overflow area which meant a bartender would be our waiter that meal.  Joe the bartender was awesome!  He was attentive, helpful, timely and friendly.  He checked on us many times despite our location being somewhat far from the bar.  We didn't have to wait long for any of our drink orders.  The food was also very tasty.  I had the Irish patty melt which was delicious.  Everyone in our group loved their food.  Given the circumstances, it was the best service I've ever had.  I'll be back just for the service.  Thanks to Joe"}
{"text":"We weren't planning on stopping in Madison on our trip from milwaukee to new glarus, (yes, a beercation), but the guy at stubbys in milwaukee said if we liked good craft, that was the joint. So, we managed to fit it in, but it meant we got there right at open. The host came outside to set up some special boards, didn't even look at us or say hello. That was a bad way to start. We sat at the bar. Ordered a couple of flights and food. Fish tacos r excellent and very large. Portion sizes r very generous. Being beer geeks, we r always psyched to go to breweries and talk to the bartenders about their beers. I guess coming so early wasn't something the bartender was happy about. He was clearly too busy setting up to care about talking beer or otherwise with us. He didn't promote their beer, didn't tell us anything about anything. We were clearly a disruption. It's such a shame bc the beer was actually really good! Food was fantastic, service sucked. So go, try the beers, but don't expect anyone to care that u r there!"}
{"text":"I'm here for Epic training so have had the opportunity to try a number of restaurants in the Madison West area.  I would return to the Vintage and would recommend to others.  Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff and patrons.  I was solo, so sat at the bar and ended up with great company and conversation with my neighbor.  As far as the food:  I had the mushroom swiss burger...lots of strong ingredients which could have easily gone wrong but it was delicious!  Despite the potential for these strong ingredients (mushroom pate, balsamic reduction, red wine something) to overpower, everything was in just the right proportion to complement but not overwhelm.  I also liked that the burger was not HUGE...so many places think bigger is better, but the size was perfect.  I still could only eat 3/4 of it.  Tater tots as a side were delicious.   Crispy and perfectly cooked.    I had a Belgian beer (not on the menu) and the basic lager.  I'm not a beer aficionado but both were tasty.  I was glad to have the option of lighter beers as so many breweries and brew pubs only feature heavily hopped or malty beers which are not palatable to me.  Overall, great job, Vintage!  There are lots of restaurant choices in Madison, and you guys have got it right!"}
{"text":"My friends and I met up here for team trivia the other night. We had a large group and sat in the bar area near the pool tables.  The services was fabulous. We had an attentive bartender who stopped by pretty frequently to keep our drinks filled. He also was prompt to wrap up our bill right near the end of the trivia bringing us each separate bills.   They have a good selection of their own beers as well as several other options on tap and in the bottle. I tried the hibiscus saison which is a farmhouse style ale. I thought it had great flavor and would order it again.  This was my first time at their trivia night. The DJ was fun, keeping things moving and included a great selection of music between questions. There was a wide range of trivia questions which would appeal to a variety of age groups."}
{"text":"Vintage is a neat place. While the food is good, not great, the beer is always fantastic. I've had a couple menu items that i've really enjoyed, and a couple that were ok, but i continue to return. Beer snobs will love the experimental styles like the Pumpkin Ale and Habiscus Saison and beer guzzlers would enjoy lighter offerings like Daytripper or McLovin'. The decor is very rustic and invokes a sort of \"vintage\" Wisconsin feel. They are a good place to enjoy a couple beers with a friend or dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Easily the Best Burger in the Madison Area and beyond! Great Beers too!  I've eaten here thrice, every time I have gotten the same \"Home Grown Burger\". It has apples on it which is different, but it adds extra juice to the already juicy burger. I have told everyone I know about this place but that is not good enough for my level of enthusiasm about this place so I must tell the internets.   In tasting meals delivered to others at my table, I was not as impressed but then again I was comparing it to the Best burger in Madison.  You will get \"5 star food\" if you order a burger. I cannot vouch for the rest.   ---A note for Beer lovers, and enjoyers: This place brews their own beer and has a good variety. It seems like the beer list is always changing but hey, I've always found something I like."}
{"text":"Oh why, oh why did The Vintage open on the Westside after we moved to McFarland?!? We spent nearly 15 years in good beer/good food exile on the Westside only to have The Vintage take over the less-than-spectacular JT Whitney's space!!! I absolutely love the retro vibe and cool feel of the space, however it's the awesome and creative beer that gets me to battle the Beltline traffic. The bartenders and servers are always attentive and willing to talk beer; that's not always the case at a popular brewpub. If you're a fan of Belgian beer, you must try the Dedication. One of my favorite things about The Vintage is the creativity of the brewmaster; just when you think a beer can't get anymore interesting, they come up with Tread Gingerly - a ginger-spiced Belgian strong ale aged in wine barrels with with Brett cultures!!!"}
{"text":"I am so very pleased with my experience dining at The Vintage last night! I'm a Vegetarian with Celiac, and my boyfriend is not. It's always a pleasant surprise to find somewhere that can accommodate both of our tastes. I am deeply appreciative of any place that offers a gluten free bun and a veggie burger replacement. I decided on the 'Home Grown' with the black bean patty and a gluten free bun. I was the happiest girl in the world! The arugula and apple flavors were incredible! I was also impressed that they offered a gluten free beer! Though it wasn't brewed by them, I was so delighted to be out on a \"burger and beer\" date with my boyfriend.  I also loved the vintage style decor! Well done, Vintage! You've just earned a couple new regulars!"}
{"text":"I don't drink and so can't comment on the brews, but been here twice now for dinner. For Madison / American food, it was pretty good. The first time was for Restaurant Week; can't remember the exact dish but it was excellent. Wraps and burgers also good. Not too loud and nice-casual. Dark, modern-retro styling and black-and-white films running on silent all night."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brew pub in Madison.  The beers are generally excellent, the upscale tavern fare delicious.  I steer friends and family here whenever I can.  The hog wing appetizers could be a meal unto themselves, if you ordered at least one per person.  Their calamari is perfectly breaded and fried.  My wife loves their stroganoff, and BBQ mac & cheese.  Both are wonderful comfort food dishes.  I prefer their bacon-crusted meatloaf, either as an entree or on a sandwich.  The combination of bacon and the spicy ketchup elevate an already moist and tasty meal well above what most folks think of as meatloaf.  My only complaint about the burgers is that they may be too large, with each featuring a half-pound of local beef from Knoche's.  I recommend the tiger burger, which they top with roasted mushrooms, caramelized onions, lots of provolone, bacon, and prime rib.  It's so good I barely look at the other burgers on their menu.  Their beer dinners, with several courses of even better food paired with short pours of beer, are amazing."}
{"text":"We returned to The Vintage Brewing Co. for dinner this past weekend. We really want this place to be great but unfortunately have not had great experiences. I will say that the beer has improved from our first visit but the kitchen needs some help.  To start things off, our server listed off 4 beers that they were out of. I completely understand how that happens sometimes but 4 seemed like quite a few.  As we were looking over the menu, he also informed us of 3 or 4 entrees they were out of for the evening. It was 7:30 on Saturday night and the place was dead. Doesn't seem like they ran out, just seems like poor planning.  Hubby and I both ordered the Woodshed IPA & it was great. We started off with cheese curds that were just okay.   Hubby ordered Not Your Mama's Stroganoff for his main meal and a cup of corn bisque. The bisque was great. The stroganoff was absolutely coated in parmesan. When the food was brought to our table, you could smell nothing but parmesan. He said the flavor was decent but it was just barely warm. By the end of the meal it was ice cold and he's a pretty quick eater.  I ordered the Southwest Chicken Wrap, opted for grilled chicken rather than fried & decided to go with the fresh veggies for an upcharge of $2.25. I think they must have skipped the Hoodoo sauce that was supposed to go on the chicken. They also completely missed the corn salsa that was to be on my wrap. It was quite boring. Something I could've thrown together myself at home in a few minutes.  Overall, I think the food is a bit overpriced, especially if you want to \"upgrade\" to a side that isn't prepared in a deep fryer. I don't expect to go to a brewpub and eat healthily but it wouldn't hurt to offer some healthier options for the same prices as the already overpriced unhealthier options.   I'm sorry Vintage Brewing Co. I really want to like your food but I think I'll just stick with the beer from now on."}
{"text":"We do like this place.  Great burgers. Yum!  Taking off a star because they are always out of some beers and they charge for everything (including things like ranch dressing)."}
{"text":"Ok place.  Service was good.  Nothing to write home about. Lots of parking.  There are better brew pubs in town if you are looking for good beer, but not many that are bigger."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times and will come again.  The food is a bit hit or miss, with generous portions, but a chicken dish that was way over seasoned and a bloody cheeseburger, have us a little wary.    Overall it is a comfortable place to eat and the wait staff is attentive and helpful.  We would come back for beers, but stick to the sandwiches.  I had a ruben that was very good."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place we have never been dissapointed by any of the food."}
{"text":"I originally gave this place 3 stars, but I'm now revising it to 1 because I believe it has seriously gone downhill. I remember eating at The Vintage shortly after it opened and was AMAZED by the quality of the food and everything was absolutely delicious. I've been here at least 6 times for dinner since then, and the last 4 times the food was horrible. I've ordered something new each time, thinking it might have been a fluke. But nope, every item I've encountered on their menu is consistently unappetizing.    I was shocked when I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf this past week and discovered it was nothing at all like the meatloaf I had ordered in the past. It consisted of small, greasy pieces of meat with hardly any bacon. You could only taste the grease in the meat. The brussels sprouts were obviously frozen... even though they were supposed to be their seasonal vegetable. The mashed potatoes were runny and covered by a gravy that taste as if it came straight out of a can. This is a long and sad fall from the meatloaf they had on their menu a year ago - a meatloaf that was thick and juicy and probably one of the best I ever tasted.   I can only assume that their entire menu has changed and all of it for the worse. My boyfriend ordered one of their burger specials and he barely ate half of it - it was the sloppiest, mushiest looking burger I have ever seen.  I will point out that the service at The Vintage has always been great, and I like their beer. I'll come back to drink... and it's a nice joint to do just that. But I'm staying clear of the food from now on."}
{"text":"The Irish Nachos..and maxmillion awesome combo..Party in the mouth..We had a sandwich on marble rye bread,,,the out side crust was dry.Over all though looking to try some more foods,and beers.Their  Scarrty cat was on the tame side for a dark beer lover like me..But it was still a good pint *-*"}
{"text":"All 4 of us hated our food. I had a build your own chicken sandwich. The bun was soggy, the avocadoes were brown, the onions were unrecognizable and it had a strange perfumey taste. Fries were super salty and I usually love salt. Asked for a side of ranch and got a tiny little cup and was charged $1 for it. Really? Everyone else hated their food and 2 out of the 4 of us got sick off of it. Never again!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub type, good food, solid service."}
{"text":"The natural comparison is the Great Dane.    Food here?  MUCH BETTER Beer here?  This is simply not a comparison.  Vintage wins.  Like the Packers playing the Bears - there is just no competition."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I wasn't super stoked. I think I hyped it up too much in my head and it did not meet expectations. Do not get me wrong, it was great. But the portion sizes just did not match the price to me. I would go here again, just not my first choice."}
{"text":"We just had one of the best meals in recent memory at vintage brewing.  They have the best Weiss beer I've had outside of Munich as well."}
{"text":"My wife & I came here for the first time to celebrate after purchasing our new home.  The Divine Swine Sandwich and Fish & Chips entree were over-the-top!  Some great beers, too - we had Woodshed IPA & McLovin Irish Red.  Looking forward to trying more.  Our server, Randy, was prompt & hilarious.  Thanks again.  We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is the perfect \"let's meet for drinks not downtown\" place. The atmosphere is awesome and so chic. The bar is amazing and they have some awesome and fun drinks.  Love, love, love."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite burger joint so far in the Madison area (my other is Brassier V). The portions are generous for decent prices. My favorite burger was the Tiger burger (I think that is what it is called though it isn't listed on the online menu when I was checking the name) which was a burger topped with thin cut prime rib with bleu cheese, mushrooms, etc. I have also tried the Big Sky Burger (a western bacon burger - my wife's favorite), the cheese curds (not crunchy enough for me), asian pork belly bites (alright), and their homemade rootbeer (pretty strong on the licorice flavor).  Like I said, this has been my favorite burger joint and it comes highly recommended. Great for kids too!"}
{"text":"Extensive and Great beer selection. Awesome burgers. Recommend the meatball burger or the 50/50 blt burger"}
{"text":"3 words: 50/50BLT, chicken & waffles, pork belly bites.  All three were amazing. The syrup gravy on the CnW was melt in your mouth buttery deliciousness. The pork belly app was crunchy with a kick; a perfect starter. All of the flavors in the 50/50 burger exploded in my mouth. That burger alone, will bring us back. The service was great. They were fairly busy for a Friday evening, but we couldn't tell! Our server was very friendly, and had our drinks, and food orders to us faster than expected. He had recommendations about the food, and was  knowledgeable about the beer and menu.  Atmosphere is classy, yet laid back. I can't say enough good things about our visit on 8/21/14.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"The new west side Vintage is a great space to go out.  I was never in the old JT Whitney's, but I like the set up now - a large bar, an area to use for dancing etc. and plenty of seating since it's also a restaurant.  I went out for drinks and was very satisfied with the prices and the service.  A great addition to the west side for younger people to go out and mingle."}
{"text":"Didn't know the kids menu was the same as entrees. The Mac n cheese was hardly enough for a small child.  The Bee's Knees beer was lame."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Food isn't amazing but surprisingly good for a microbrewery. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The beer is great. The food is decent. I hear often how poor the service is particularly at the Whitney way location (I frequent the downtown location) - but my first experience goes as follows:  We show up at 8 on a Friday with a large group following a funeral. Tons of tables available outside so we ask to sit down and they tell us that section is closed. Then they do us a \"favor\" and let us sit down. The wait staff refused to serve us so we had to go up to the bar. Then it rained so we went inside and they again said all the empty tables were not available. They again did us a favor and let us sit down. Again they all refused to serve us with a waiter. I would say the service is the worst in town in my experience. When your income is dependent on customers and hundreds of dollars sit down and you refuse to accommodate you have to think the leadership at the organization needs to be evaluated. Too bad, the beer is fabulous."}
{"text":"We have been here many times, today Boooo Do not like the menu choices at all. Nothing jumped out & said yum. Had a burger medium served a hockey puck.... Bro man had the so-called Chicago philly??? You could get it wet or dry, he got it dry with au jus on the side, what a joke really the au jus was nothing but warm water. I have always been amazed with the Vintage so I'm going to chalk today as a BAD DAY. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hmmm...this one's tough.  There are many things I like about the Vintage- the decor and waitstaff being two.  Our most recent visit was less than awesome, primarily because my burger was ordered medium-well and came out bloody. The outside looked good, but when I cut into it, it was way underdone.  Our waiter took pains to make it right, and he verified that he'd put the order in correctly, so no fault there.    My bigger challenge is with the menu itself- it's extremely caloric and heavy, with virtually no lighter options.  Even the salads are really loaded with creamy dressings and cheese, nuts, etc. Sounds yummy, but I don't want a big tummy. I noticed that almost everything on the menu was a dollar or two higher than comparable brewpubs, as well.  We'll likely return, but would love to see some less decadent options, and better pricing."}
{"text":"Beers are great. Burgers are amazing. Staff is awesome, friendly and helpful which is nearly as important as the first 2 things.   Try the HomeGrown burger, its got white cheddar & sliced apple. So good. Scaredy Cat stout is great."}
{"text":"Beer, beer, beer, and they serve food too! Get there early on the weekends or you will get stuck with a wait.  Bar staff always friendly and knowledgeable. Prime rib sandwich and burgers (Knoches!) tasty on cold Madison nights.  Chipotle and Lime chicken wrap unexpectedly awesome.  We love it - have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent brew pub, considering it's basically in the middle of a parking lot in a strip mall. The food is good, but the beer is really, really good. Also, the wine list is actually very nice. And the best part is that the bar is open late, with a bar menu. Sure, it's limited but when you're hungry late at night and you have family in the area, Vintage is convenient.The ambiance is cute and Wisconsin-y, the bar it big, but the dining room is also very big. The menu has a lot of interesting items but they seem to run out of things and not tell you before you start ordering-- this includes beers. The service is very cheerful, funny and good. Definitely a worthwhile destination for friendly service and excellent beer-- I loved the Weiss beer. On one visit, wanted the pretzel but they were out. On another visit, my husband picked two beers that were out before he got to a third that they had, so don't get your heart set on any one thing on the menu because they might not have it! The flatbread on the late night menu is actually fairly good pizza."}
{"text":"Can only give one star, as we were left unattended at the bar. Without a drink or service...we left.  The bar was kind-of full. We seated ourselves and watched the bartender go around the bar offerering established customers refills. This went on for 8 minutes before we decided to leave. He never paid attention to us once.   During our stay, we witnessed them pour beers that were 50% foam. As educated beer drinkers, we know this means the beer is warm. Problem: THEY POURED EXTRA FOAM INTO PITCHERS AND THEN USED THESE PITCHERS TO FILL PINTS FOR THE SERVICE BAR. On top of that, we also saw them pour these foam-catching pitchers INTO GROWLERS being sold to patrons. Not okay.  Upon leaving we told the hostess, who was very nice, that we were never served. Her response was: \"None of the 3 bartenders served you?\"  ...There were three!!?? Holy moly! We left and went to \"Babe's\" a few blocks away for good service....and they were great."}
{"text":"Been here twice since it opened. Once to eat and other for drinks..   I think its just what that spot needed! The remodeled interior is very well done! I love the nice big bar. The booths surrounding the bar can fit six perfect for drinks!   Drinks were very good! Try out the sangria, and any of the ice cream drinks.  Yum!  The food was good also.  I had the pulled pork sloppy joe and I was happy with that.  I did think a few of the items on the menu were a little overpriced.. Thats why I stuck with the Joe.  It was very good though!  The waitstaff was very friendly and our bartender was really up on his game.  Now keep up the good work people and I think the Vintage Brewing Co. will be here quite some time.   Can't wait to taste the currently brewing beer!  Sounds yummy!  Any day now....."}
{"text":"Vintage Burgers I am a cook at Vintage Brewing Co., so while my rating may be biased, I can provide you with actual facts about our menu. After reading one review that falsely stated there are breadcrumbs in our burgers, I took it upon myself to set it straight. At Vintage Brewing Co., we have several types of burgers. Our regular burgers are formed in house, and made with high-quality ground beef sourced from Knoche's butcher shop. There are 0 additives in them. NO breadcrumbs or other fillers, just 100% beef. Our Meatball burger does in fact have breadcrumbs in it, as would a normal meatball. Our 50/50 burger is made with a 50% beef and 50% bacon mixture (again, no breadcrumbs). And last, but certainly not least, our Buffalo burger is made with locally farm-raised buffalo, and absolutely no fillers. Hope you found this review helpful, and will stop in and investigate our burgers for yourself. And if you do have a gluten allergy, or just want to live the gluten-free lifestyle, I'll be happy to put a burger on a gluten-free bun for you. Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Madison restaurants of all time. Always get the tots with your meal, you will never regret it. My go to is the Home Grown burger. The apple pie shots at the downtown location are excellent! The owner love to use vintage décor and lamps, just as much as I do :)"}
{"text":"Nice location. Waitress was ok, nothing special shall I say. Nice setup but it was very dark in there. It wasn't crowded but she sat us in between 2 other groups which was puzzling to me. You can try a few samples but the waitress acted as she was getting annoyed and kind of pushed to order a beer. My boyfriend ordered a double grilled cheese burger, another friend got the surf n turf as I ordered BBQ tacos smh. What was I thinking? They brung out 2 huge burgers. The grilled cheese had 2 cheese sandwiches with a huge burger in between with 2 friend eggs including tomatoes, lettus and onions. Huge! Surf n turf was 4 jumbo shrimp on a huge burger topped with cheese and hollandaise sauce! Perfection! Besides the the waitress acting as we annoyed her and her sitting is in the crowded area and it being dark. The food was good except those damn tacos. Boy was I pissed when she sat those burgers down next to my bullshit taco dinner SMH! She could at least warned me lol!!!!"}
{"text":"Large, diverse, and delicious selection of beers made in-house. My only complaint is that every time I stop here they are out of a beer I want to try! The food is good too and the staff is accommodating about substitutions. Also, they have great Badger game specials."}
{"text":"Much improved over the old J.T. Whitney's. Good happy hour specials."}
{"text":"-4 stars for the food that my date and I had, +1 star for the wait-staff service, and being seated quickly during an extremely busy Thursday night.  My date got the chili - only ate half of it. There was so much cheese in it, and she said it tasted like spicy marinara with beans.  I had the beef stroganoff. It was so oily, that there was an oil slick underneath. It also caused me to have gastronomical issues for the remainder of the evening.  I might go back to try a burger..."}
{"text":"Man oh man! Why is it that most places in this city have trouble cooking a burger to the right temperature? I've started ordering rare burgers at restaurants in hopes of getting something less than a chewy over done burger.   Congrats Vintage! That black and bleu burger was probably the best burger I've had in Madison. It was seasoned well, had a great crust, cooked to the requested temp, tasty toppings and a sturdy bun. Yum yum yum! The prices on some of the burgers are high (up to $15), but when you consider the size (1/2 lb. patties) and how damn tasty they are, it's worth every penny   To top it off, I had an incredible beer: Toil & Trouble. I've never tasted anything like it and I'm at a loss for the right descriptors...sort of a sour ale, but totally different. Here's the description: Spiced with heather tips and mugwort (no hops), brewed with a portion peat-smoked malt, and wildfermented for a pleasing tartness... unless your name's Beowulf, you've not tasted an ale like this! Don't hesitate on this one...it's limited and our server warned us it won't last long.   I can safely say, if want a good burger and brews head out to Vintage."}
{"text":"Stop by this place after work hours and it was busy so probably happy hour going on but got seated quickly. Great beer menu that I got the sample flight and liked all my choices. Also ordered food and got the chicken and waffle and the wife got the pork belly. The pork belly was very good and everything melted but it was just not my cup of tea, the wife enjoy it. Finally the chicken and waffle, the waffle was average nothing special but the chicken tho, amazing! So amazing that I'd just order the chicken along, so juicy and tender and crispy. I made the mistake of pouring all the syrup over everything but over all nice vintage feel to it. Definitely go back for their list of beer."}
{"text":"Everyone can agree upon Vintage - its location, beer selection, menu. I recently experienced one of the private party rooms in the back of the building. It was nicely done, with what appeared to be a full-ish bar and taps (vs pop up table). Staff did well tending to the buffet and our drink needs.  This month I also experienced a happy hour, which I haven't in some time. They offer some deal each day of the week, most of which don't apply to me, but I of course love a $1 off tap. I have recently discovered Vintage's McLovin (red ale and clean). This was of incredible relief to me since, like at some other local breweries, I previously struggled with finding beers that were clean and clear (not the face wash) for people with allergies, however also not their local version of Bud Light. There is an in between! McLovin is it.  Given it was a summer on a Friday and I've heard their fish is good, I tried the fish tacos. I was pleasantly surprised. Three tacos arrived accompanied by a small dish of salsa and a very large portion of both beans and rice. Inside each taco was a whole piece of fried cod (as thick as my wrist), among other goodies. I apparently felt the need to eat all three, though saved the sides for later.  Patio is cute with different sized tables, hanging lights; the noise from the road was not nearly as much of an issue as I anticipated. Waiter was too attentive(?) for our taste, checking back incessantly making us feel as if we needed to leave despite there being many open tables. This is a good place to drink late in the night but after being so full and given the vibe, we continued drinking elsewhere. Vintage has its purpose."}
{"text":"I am so glad I didn't review this place on my first visit. The service was absolutely atrocious to the point where we weren't sure if we'd come back. We decided to give this place a second chance, because the food really was great. I now count Vintage among my favorite Madison restaurants.   The food is consistently mouthwatering and portions are more than ample for the price. And they nearly always have a different nightly food special to add on to their somewhat simple menu.  For an appetizer you must try the heaping plate of nachos (add chorizo, YUM!)   I am also quite in love with the beers they brew in-house. Truly a variety for every type of beer-drinking palate. And they have new stuff on tap all the time- with some especially tasty seasonal selections.   As if the food and brews aren't enough, I am absolutely enamored with the atmosphere and retro decor! I always looks forward to my bill being brought to me on the sweetest little vintage plates!"}
{"text":"I've got nothing to say about the brewing, as I don't drink, but the food is very good. I've been a couple times now, and everyone I've been with had thoroughly enjoyed their food. \"The Popper\" was amazing. I also enjoyed the Big Sky burger, though it was a bit salty. The fries are very, very good."}
{"text":"Great food and big portions, fantastic beer selections. Been there 5 times in the last five months and have had great service and poor service from waitresses. But it has been progressively better and better the more often I've gone. Management seems to have addressed the concerns I've seen in reviews. I really hope they get it dialed in because their products are too good to miss of poor service."}
{"text":"You guys! Why does this place only have 3.5 stars? I LOVED IT. So far, this is one of my fave spots in Madison.  The décor is right up my alley - just as it's called, it is vintage, and most rockabilly.  You can also watch them do whatever it is they do to the beer while it's fermenting. SO COOL.  Their beer list is insane. Being a basic white girl, I ordered the pumpkin beer and it was hands down the best pumpkin beer I've ever had (and I've had my fair share). It had just right amount of spices, pumpkin, and sweetness. I also tried the Dedication and it was basically life changing. I would go back just for this. Seriously, I've never had anything like it before. So complex.  The food was pretty solid too, and inexpensive. I had their version of a Rueben which had corned beef patties and was delish. My fiancé had their Taco Tuesday flatbread special and that was also great. Just a little spicy, but not too much. Our server was great (I wish I could remember her name!) but she really took her time explaining their brewery to us, their menu, her favorites, and also that they are expanding.  I see us becoming regulars at the place, and I will be stopping in very soon to fill up a growlers of their Pumpkin Disorderly."}
{"text":"Yikes!  I guess if you want service at the bar you have to be a regular....  I waited for close to 10 minutes without being acknowledged.  In server world, that is 8 minutes too long to not acknowledge your paying customer's existence.  All around me people were being served, even those who arrived after me....  At least the ones who seemed to \"know someone.\"  I was finally saved by Peter who realized that neither of the other bartenders cared to help me (though as soon as my male counterpart arrived, he received service within 3 minutes).    I think I'll stick to table service.  I haven't been disappointed there yet."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision for dinner...on Badger Football game day....on Family night.  So literally every place was packed and every place had a wait of at least an hour...so our expectations were low.    The hostess was very nice and reasonable on her time estimate for 2 people (20-30 minutes, I think we were seated in 20 mins).  She came and found us in the bar where we were enjoying some delicious Pumpkin Disorderly.  We watched as waitress after waitress kept passing us by before we flagged one down and told her we were ready to order.  Despite the poor service, she apoligized and told us she thought we were already being helped because we already had drinks (that we brought over from the bar).  Simple mistake, its busy and she was honest with her response which I respected.  The food was awesome.  Mainly burgers and bar food -- I had the pinapple and cream cheese burger with waffle fries.  You could put cream cheese on a shoe and I'd probably eat it but honestly this was really well done.  It was a thin slice of cream cheese, not a glob, and it was matched perfectly with the sweet grilled pinapple.  Reasonably priced and we were in and out within an hour.  I would check out this place again."}
{"text":"The service her is amazing bad.  We watched 2 bar tenders wait on about 10 people who came in after us.  When the bartender waited on some women that walked up next to us I made the mistake of saying hey we have been waiting for a while.   We were scolded and told \"I doesn't need this.\"   I am truly sorry I ruined her day with my frustration and would like to apologize for disrupting her night by attempting to buy beer.   I am happy to say I don't NEED to ever go to a restaurant or bar where the employees are rude to their customers.    I agree with many of the other comments here that service is almost non-existent."}
{"text":"We had bbq baked Mac and cheese and fish & chips. Good food, great beer. We'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Come here often with friends and coworkers.  Drinks and food always good.  Home grown burger is phenomenal.  Tots are always a treat."}
{"text":"I have been to the Vintage Brewing Company twice now, and both times my food has been fantastic. The first time I went I ordered the stroganoff, which was one of the best things I have ever eaten. The perfect comfort food for a fall day. The second time we went I got their fish fry, and the pieces of fish that they serve were huge! Definitely worth the price we paid. The fish was delicious too.   I'm a big fan of their beer selection, all of which (aside from guest taps) are brewed there I assume. I was pleasantly surprised by their wide selection of different beer types. A lot of times with smaller breweries you only get one decent beer for each type (porter, stout, hefeweizen, etc.) but here they had a pretty decent selection. I'm for sure looking forward to going back to do some more beer tasting, & to definitely enjoy that amazing stroganoff again."}
{"text":"So far the experience here is terrible. Here at 5:00 feb1 no warm greeting from the hostess clearly not thrilled to be seating us. We sat near a nice fireplace  and then waited for 10 min until simeone finally stopped by the table and saud she just came on and didn't know anyone was in her section. We will see if the food is worth returning becausd si far we are not at all impressed."}
{"text":"Giving Vintage full stars for they exceed expectations. Went there again last Saturday night for dinner. The last time we were there we had their burgers and they were amazing, one of the best in town. Anyway, on this night we started with the Asian Pork Belly Bites as an appetizer. We were worried about portion size as these are more of a gourmet app than cheese curds. Well, we got six huge pork rolls that are deep fried, rolled in  sweet Thai chili sauce and served with wasabi-cilantro aioli and pickled veggies. Okay, I truly believe this is the best appetizer I've ever eaten in Madison if not of all time. Epic must have. For dinner Jack wanted the meat loaf, but he wanted to be daring and tried the Pot Roast Balls - a pot roast dinner, beer battered & deep fried. Three chimi-like balls that contain braised beef short rib, roasted carrots, caramelized onions & roasted garlic mashed potatoes and served in VBC Scaredy Cat Stout beef gravy. While it sounded really good, the deep fried battering just didn't quite go with the contents, but accolades to the chef for daring to be different! They weren't bad, just didn't hit home that night. I ordered the chicken pot pie and they did it right. Perfect flaky crust and the correct contents and consistency that most restaurants have not been able to pull off. Accompanied by their IPA and a great (and cute) waitress, this is a place we will definitely return to soon. Heard their nachos are incredible. Kissy"}
{"text":"This place is super delicious. But, if you are looking for an in and out sort of lunch or dinner, I would not recommend this restaurant. The service is incredibly slow, especially if you have a large party. I highly recommend coming here because the food and staff are awesome, but certainly not a place you want to grab a quick bite to eat..you'll be sitting for a while."}
{"text":"Love this place!   From their beer to their food and service they rock!  Favorite place in Madison."}
{"text":"Visiting someone nearby, he recommended this place. Had the High on the Hog burger with the spicy coleslaw. Top notch. Friendly service."}
{"text":"They brew decent beer. The food is average to above average depending on what you order. The service has always been good on my visits. The patio is nice in the summer."}
{"text":"Just wanted to send out a \"thank you\" to Barnyard P. for the kind compliment he sent me on this review.  \"Good of you to yelp so much, so we can all keep up with how damned clueless you are\"  So, I assume \"barnyard\" is an owner or close friend of this place.  Thanks, you made me smile today Barnyard.  Now when you finally post a profile or review something....then you can message me again.  http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LgYkIqEVtJK_ZJBYVeTj0Q"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom good food and even better beer, this place has changed hands over the years but Vintage has finally pulled it off, fast service with good food is a homerun anywhere but here it makes you come back."}
{"text":"Great food and beer selection! A lot of more classic German, American, and Belgian styles, but a few had some more modern twists. We had a great server and hung out for a few hours at the end of our first day in Madison drinking several different pints between our group.  Overall a great place that I will for sure visit again the next time I'm in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"Summer in Wisconsin can be best described as: beer, cheese curds, and outdoor seating. Vintage  Brewing Company lays this perfect backdrop for catching up with an old friend. The hibiscus saison was delicious and beautifully red-totally unexpectedly nice."}
{"text":"My food was excellent (3 fish tacos and homemade pretzels with beer-cheese dip).  Portions were generous.  I took home a left-over lunch and sadly had no room for dessert.  Next time, I'll restrain myself with my main course.  Great beer, drinks, and wines!      The place is run like clockwork and the staff was attentive and very professional.  The entire place is sparkling clean and orderly--including the bathrooms.  Yay!  They've taken a pretty big space and made it feel cozy, charming, and warm with lots of seating and lounging areas.  The decor features loads of fun, authentic, and enviable antique pieces and the atmosphere created is original.  Nothing is squeezed out of a tube here--antiques, not reproductions.  So many nice little touches--lamp light, bathroom toiletries, flowers, an old score board, etc....  A great addition to the neighborhood and Madison!"}
{"text":"Rolled up to Vintage Brewing Company after the game and as a stop before we hit the road back to Chicago.  I don't know if I was expecting a tiny little bar or an industrial park type joint, but I was thrown off by the expansiveness of Vintage.  The place is pretty big and fancier than I would have thought (I think the leather couches threw me off), has a nice sized bar (with a fish tank! I don't know why, but I love that), a view into the brewery through large glass windows, decent seating inside, and a large patio outside as well (where we opted to sit).  I ordered a sampler (make my own of course...but they had two pre-made flights as well) and some nachos for the man.  I didn't care much for the nachos (I am the pickiest nacho enthusiast alive) but the beer was pretty good.    Here's what I tried:    Daytripper- Decent ale but too light bodied and crisp (almost pilsner-y) for my taste.  Rhine Heights- Malty and smooth and hoppy enough to have SOME bite.  I think it was an Alt-Bier.   Better Off Red- Nice malty presence with a decent hoppy finish.  I could drink a pint or two of this no problem.  Woodshed IPA- YEP.  This is it.  Aroma is deceiving as it's hoppy and spicy with a nice malt backbone but doesn't smell like anything but grain.    Scaredy Cat Stout- Strong espresso flavor with a nice vanilla-y finish.  YUM."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, many of the drink items (including obviously the beer, but also soda's) are made in house and they are very good! Great food, great atmosphere, overall a place that is worth checking out even if it is a little pricey for some items.   Also you can buy their beer they make in house and take it home with you, which I recommend since it's great!"}
{"text":"Oh dear! I hate to submit a scathing review (I really do) this but the pumpkin ravioli with arugula and walnuts that I had here the other day for lunch was quite possibly THE WORST plate of pasta that I have ever attempted to eat in my entire life (and I am over 50, people). Honestly it was almost inedible to the point that I left over half the meal on my plate and actually walked out of the restaurant still hungry. I didn't want to embarrass my friend who took me to lunch and so graciously presented me with a wedding gift (yes, I just got married) so I said nothing. It was awkward enough that my friend had ordered a dish with no mention of nuts in the menu description and when it arrived it had nuts all over it (she is highly allergic). She said sometimes she breaks out in a rash just by breathing something in that has nuts. Anyway, I could scarcely believe the lukewarm, rubber-like droppings that were supposed to pass for pumpkin raviolis drenched in the most disgusting, tasteless sauce that resembled creme-colored mayonnaise (it tasted like it had been thickened with starch). Yikes! Drinks are another story at Vintage (hard to screw up a bottled beer or beer on tap) but the food leaves a whole helluva lot to be desired. I have only eaten at Vintage three times: once it was so-so (I don't remember what I ate, maybe a burger on the outdoor patio) and the other time (it was the first time) was a rerun of this visit--completely and utterly  awful. I am not trying to be a drama queen here. I am NOT a picky eater. I can assure you that I will gobble down just about anything especially when I'm famished which I often am, but holy batman this meal was borderline unforgivable. I actually felt SORRY for the ravioli as it resembled something that had been killed, boiled, stabbed, broiled, beaten, and then microwaved...TWICE. That's the only explanation I can come up with for how something that is supposed to be a delicate, delicious, winter treat like pumpkin pasta could taste so god awful bad. So sorry, Vintage! I'm sure I'll be back for Happy Hour one of these days but three strikes, you're out when it comes to your food. I'm afraid you won't see me back for lunch. :("}
{"text":"All batter no fish fry.  Burger cold and red in middle. They offered to \"put it back on.\"  Forget it, not worth the wait and tater tots (only + in dining experience) would get cold.  Food was less than mediocre but the rude waitress guaranteed the single star."}
{"text":"I can see where this would be a regular stop. Lots of brews available and a nice variety on the menu. Service was fast and friendly. They charged us for chips which we didn't get. When we pointed that out they were really good about taking it off.  I discovered I'm not a chicken and waffle guy. That's on me, not them. The rest of my crew enjoyed their meals. The chicken noodle soup was...interesting. More like a vegetable soup with chicken and elbow macaroni.  You could do worse than this place, but I know there's better out there too."}
{"text":"When JT Whitney's finally closed, and the long, slow process of turning the space into the Vintage was over, I was really looking forward to what it would turn out to be. Vintage Brewing is a great place to get a drink, but the food didn't live up to expectations the time I was there.  But you know what, if I can hop off the Beltline, and stop for a drink in pleasant surroundings, I'm not overall concerned if I'm not crazy about the food.  I'm curious about there in house microbrews, and will be looking forward to those in the future."}
{"text":"So I've become a convert. The sidewinder fries are great, the burgers seem much better (though they could maybe add another signature burger or two to the menu), and the noise levels seem better."}
{"text":"We had our wedding rehearsal dinner there. Also my wife threw her friends wedding shower there. They have great food, great beer, and all but once great service. Once a bartender was a jerk to me but people have bad days.  They have a great menu. It's one of our favorites for date night and we love meeting our parents for a night out."}
{"text":"So for starters, we ordered the fried cheese curds. Not bad, they were hot and what we were expecting. We ordered the fried pickles next. They came out luke warm, and still frozen in the middle. We sent them back, and the wait staff was accommodating, and the advised us that they would be removed from our bill. My wife ordered a salad, and it was as expected. My dad ordered a wrap, it came out hot which was good, but the potato tots were also cold. Again, it was brought to the attention of the staff, and again they accommodated and brought him out a hot fresh order. My mother had a chicken sandwich which was good. Finally, I ordered a medium rare burger and curly fry potatoes. The fries were hot and good, but the burger was cooked to death, and was STILL cold in the middle. Yet again, this was brought to the staff's attention and they removed it from our bill. I ate half the burger because I was pretty hungry, and was tired of complaining. We tried. THEY tried, but we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't get to Madison very often, but when I do this is a stop that I like to make when I'm with friends.  There's plenty of seating here, along with a bar and an outdoor patio.  They make their own beer which is fantastic. McLovin, Toy Boat IPA, Scaredy Cat and the Ginja Ninja are some good ones to try. They do rotate their own beers, and it's sad when you had one beer one time and then it's not there another time. I've never been disappointed with the food. The last time I was here I had the BBQ Mac n' Cheese.  The top layer was all the cheesy goodness and the bottom layer was shredded BBQ pork. It was a great combo putting the two  main WI food groups together (cheese + meat). The pork a little spicy for me, but I'm a wimp when it comes to that stuff.  Good thing the server kept filling up my water glass."}
{"text":"Great beer, good food. Enjoy sitting outside in summer enjoying their beer selection."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a relaxed, casual, yet quality place around Madison and this is it! From their wide selection of home-brewed craft beers, to the varying and tasty menu, this is a must-try for anyone! The waitstaff and bar tenders were super friendly and accommodating. Some of the highlights of our visit were the ranch dressing and the bees knees craft beer. They also have some very local cheese curds. I highly recommend Vintage to everyone!"}
{"text":"One star ( no star if I can give) for the service they provided. Right from the time we entered the restaurant, we had to wait for about 10 mins to get seated. We requested to be seated outside, the hostess told us they don't serve outside today. She didn't ask us our preference for a booth or a table, she just seated us. After we ordered, we saw waiters carrying food outside to serve guest!!!! I asked our waitress why we won't allowed to and she said well.. It's been raining. Well... There was no freaking rain!!!!! Even after we were seated and had ordered our food, we saw a couple being taken outside. Not even commenting about food. We could have just walked out then but since we ordered already. We stayed. For however good the food may have been( which by the way wasn't out of the ordinary) the service was bullshit. Our food took 40 mins to come out!!!!! Not coming here again for sure!!!! I don't usually go there but it felt like racial discrimination!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I know none of us beer-lovers wants to admit it, but craft beer has become completely mainstream. We've tried almost every style of beer out there, and deep down, we're pining away for something more.  Which is why you should come here. In a city with a glut of amazing breweries and brewpubs, Vintage stands out because it does things differently than the other places. I always look forward to the bizarre and unique beer choices that I'll find each time I visit. Not to say that they don't also have very solid, classic styles of beer - the Woodshed IPA and the Derby Girl ESB are fantastic. I just love that I can also come here and try the Jinja Ninja or the bright pink Hibiscus Saison if I feel like mixing things up. If you come on Monday, the beers are only 2.50. Let me repeat that: amazing craft beer for 2.50 a pint.  And quite frankly, Vintage is clearly home to some really innovative thinkers. When I attended the Great Taste of the Midwest in 2011, Vintage had what amounted to a huge, swank lounge set up at their booth. You could laze about on leather couches, enjoying the brightly colored fish swimming about in the enormous fish tank while you sampled their beers. This, in the middle of a grassy field at Olin Park.  The atmosphere at Vintage itself is very similar. The place is dark, dark, dark, with low lighting, dark wood, and a beautiful aquarium behind the bar. There are many comfortable places to sit or lounge, and the dining area is similarly dark and comfortable. The icing on the cake is the brand new outdoor area, where you can eat or drink under the lovely little lights strung across the patio.  I generally go to Vintage for the beer, but I've enjoyed some good meals there as well. They have creative menu ideas that are generally well-executed. The portions are huge, so feel comfortable splitting an entree with a friend."}
{"text":"The Vintage has a few big hits (pulled pork mac n cheese, pork roasts balls etc.) however the quality of a number of items on the menu is lacking.  3 hours after eating the BBBLT last night I found myself hugging my basement sink, EXTREMELY sick... first guess would be under-cooked pork belly on the sandwich.  In a previous visit the shrimp Bahn Mi also fell far short of expectations.... Some good, 2 Great, the rest.... eh."}
{"text":"The Vintage has some of the best beer in Madison. They always have a great variety of beers to choose from and excellent food to boot. My favorite beer is the Woodshed IPA.  The perfect match for the patio on a hot summer day. Plus they have a grilled cheese cheeseburger, yes thats right, a cheeseburger between two grilled cheese sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Vintage Brewing Company definitely brews some strong beers. I enjoyed my \"Scaredy Cat\" - a pitch black beer (Oatmeal Stout). I must say, I haven't traditionally been a fan of dark beers, but I have really started to find ones that I enjoy and this... this is one that I can add to my list.  Now, the food. I made a mistake when I ordered the Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger. Yes, it's a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, burger, fried egg, and another grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Which, yes, that is a lot of food - and I went in with the intention of saving extra for lunch the following day. Plus, I've had a similar sandwich in Winter Park, CO and loved it. For me, the ham in the ham and cheese just tasted 'off.' I don't know if the ham went bad or if it was simply one too many ingredients.  I think if I go again, I will stick to something a little more simple, such as the Home Grown Burger (I hear that is one that I need to try). I will also be stopping by their downtown locations, I hear there are some great drink specials there and I want another Scaredy Cat soon!"}
{"text":"Good local brew pub, but we didn't have anything that knocked us off our feet or encouraged us that it was a must return.  The dinner salad, and homegrown burger we had were good and well prepared.  The Whippoorwill witbier and Summer Sihat (sp?) beer were pleasant but don't stand above other summer craft beers we had enjoyed."}
{"text":"Cool bar! The fish tank is a nice touch. All types stop in. And the energy is always a good time. Try the trepidation beer... It's dope!"}
{"text":"Good food. Drinks are drinks. Atmosphere is okay. I like the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I was expecting something amazing from this restaurant, but I was sadly let down. I thought for the prices I would at least not leave hungry, but for $8.75 we got a portion of cheese curds fit only for a small child. My buffalo burger was good, but all of the unnecessary toppings coveted the flavor of the meat. The worst thing that we ordered was a mac and cheese with BBQ pork. The pork tasted like canned tuna and the sauce was beyond bland. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the beer here.  I've eaten here twice and was not blown away by the food.  It's good pub food, though.  The place gets pretty busy on weekend nights."}
{"text":"I heard about Vintage Brewing while I was at a different stop on my Madison leg of beercation.  I decided to squeeze it in while I was in town.  I am glad that I did.  Vintage is located in a standalone building next to a strip mall.  There is plenty of parking.  The interior is large and new looking.  It is tastefully decorated with lots of wood.  There are a fair number of TVs but they are not overly obtrusive.  I sat at the bar in the center of the place.  It is a large rectangular bar with seating all around.  There is a big fish tank in the center.  The bar stools were comfortable and there was a chair rail for my feet.  They also had purse hooks for the ladies.  I had limited time to enjoy Vintage so I ordered the sampler.  I asked for one of everything they had on tap.  That turned out to be 17 beers!  I ended up staying a little longer than I had originally planned.  The selection of styles was very impressive and overall the beer was good.  There were a few lighter beers as there always is at these places.  They weren't bad, but just not my style.  The oatmeal stout was very tasty and so was the APA.  Of course I liked the barrel aged beer too.  There was an islay style beer that I found very interesting due to the unique peat flavor.  I am not a big fan of islay scotch, but the beer was worth a try.  I am not sure I could drink a whole pint of it though.  I was planning on eating at my next stop of the day, so I didn't order much in the way of food.  The fried cheese curds gave me something to munch on while working my way through the many beers.  Since I was at Vintage on a weekday afternoon, the place emptied out after the lunch rush.  It felt luxurious to have the whole place to myself.  We chatted with the bartender and the hostess who were friendly.  Our water glasses were filled repeatedly as we savored our collection of samples over a couple of hours.  Overall, I liked Vintage so much that I bought the t-shirt.  I liked the wide variety of beers and the atmosphere was nice.  I would definitely come back to this place if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Three stars is probably generous considering the entrees we had, but the service was excellent as was the beer.   My wife ordered the shrimp scampi with pasta which was delicious but she was a little dismayed when she bit in to a shrimp tail--then another.  Who leaves the tails on shrimp in scampi?  I guess the Vintage does...   I ordered a full rack of their ribs and thought somebody was playing a joke on me when I attempted to cut into them.   I've seen much softer leather!  I called our server over and asked if they had some less-done ribs (and I NEVER send food back to the kitchen).  The second batch was a little better, but still tough as hell on the ends. Low and slow on pork, Vintage!   Our server was very attentive and pleasant, the beer was excellent, but the food sucked."}
{"text":"Great beer!  The food is usually really good, but there have been a few times lately that quality is way down."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and a beer after our son's volleyball game last night.  My wife ordered the BBQ Baked Mac N Cheese.  First impression was unappealing, but she gave it a chance.....after getting into the meal, it was extremely dry and lacked flavor.  I ordered the Breakfast Burger (medium)....presentation was good and it looked appealing.  Unfortunately, the burger was well done and the sausage gravy was very bland.  Great beer, not so great food."}
{"text":"For a small brew pub, they sure do make a tasty beer.  And the names?  Yes, I WILL have a McLovin.  When you think of brewpubs in Madison, Vintage may not be the first mention.  Now it definitely will be for me.  The beers made here are incredibly good, and there is quite a good selection as well.  The food is also excellent as well.  I had the chicken pot pie, and while it ended up more like a chicken pot pie soup, it was still good.    This is a great choice for American style food and most definitely a great stop for beers."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Our waitress was not only gorgeous, but super nice, informative and helpful. The food was everything my taste buds could have asked for! This place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"One of our absolutely favorite restaurants. We come here lots and it's absolutely delicious, with great food AND great drinks."}
{"text":"We were determined to give this place a fair shot. Today was the third and final time we'll walk out of there dissapointed and over charged. First off, let me say that I do like the places ambiance and set up. But don't plan on stopping in for lunch and getting out of there under an hour. Saying the service is slow is an understatement. Our last visit was on a Sunday afternoon (a typically slow time) and our server didn't even take our entree order til after we had been finished with our appetizer for over 5 minutes. The food is inconsistent and leaves you wanting more. But what takes the cake is that we were upcharged a dollar for a side of mayo and then another dollar for a side of BBQ....the server never mentioned any kind of charge. There are way too many fantastic places to eat in Madison to waste your time here."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have tried a handful of dishes. Everything is good, but the Asian Pork Belly Bites and the Stroganoff are the best!   I have always had good service and the food is good quality and value. But the only dishes I will go back for are the Asian Pork Belly Bites and the Stroganoff."}
{"text":"We stopped at this charming little brew pub on a road trip and I absolutely loved the 1930s style atmosphere! It really adheres to its name. The beer, the food, and the service were great, and we had a wonderful time. I definitely would recommend this restaurant and look forward to giving it another try!"}
{"text":"My husband is obsessed with nachos, and I don't think we will ever beat the ones here. If you want the house made chips crispy, you'll have to get on that pile quickly, but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"I remember eating at Vintage a couple years back and not really liking it, and things apparently haven't changed. Everyone's food tonight was pretty bad, and we won't return.  First of all, it's way too expensive. Some of the burgers are like $15! I opted for the Chipotle Turkey & Bacon ($10.50) only because the menu made it sound really special. It looked and tasted like something you'd get from Arby's. My friend's Chicken Pot Pie ($11.75) was a muddled mess, and several dollars too expensive. One of us went with the Crispy Buffalo sandwich, and that was a confusing disaster. It's a ground chicken patty slathered in buffalo sauce. Why ground chicken?!  Doesn't that technically make it a burger?! It was disgusting. Lastly, one of us ordered the Southwest Chicken salad, which was also a confusing mess. I guess you'd call it a deconstructed salad. It was weird, and my dining companion struggled with it.   The only good things about our visit were the beer and the staff. The beer was decent and every employee we dealt with was fantastic. A shame about that food, though. Blegh."}
{"text":"They've got a really good selection of beer. I don't think I've ever tasted a beer better than the McLovin.  Their food is so-so. Some menu items are delicious while others are awful. I don't recommend getting any sort of fish here. It's usually very dry and tasteless. Their prices are a bit on the high side too.  The service is just fine. Wait staff isn't always incredibly cheery and friendly, but they get your food and bill to you quickly.   Good place for a nice lunch or a few beers in the evening."}
{"text":"The menu is a couple bucks pricier as many point out, but still very good. The Tiger burger (prime rib on top of a buger) is amazing and many of their own brewed beers are very solid.  Pretty big place with a nice, old school decor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, interesting food choices, gluten free menu, excellent service. My husband had the \"better off red\" for his beer choice and loved it! My son was equally happy with the \"wheat heavy\". To quote my son...the food was fanfrickintastic!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty fair.  Some of their brews are pretty good, others are not so good.  Service has been spotty."}
{"text":"Written in nov. 2015....  I go for the beer.   Big improvement during the last year on the pretzels and tots, thank you. Used to taste dry on the inside and hard on the out.   Pork nachos, delicious."}
{"text":"It's an OK place.. The beer is meh and the food is meh. Nothing we had was good. The waitress knew nothing about the beers they brew in house. Just what they were called and the food was extremely salty and dry. The kids pasta had spicy sausage in it instead of hamburger. So needless to say all the meals went half eaten. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have lived in the madison area for awhile and this place has been consistently my and my husband's favorite place for lunch.   The food is delicious and staff are incredible!"}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience here with the chicken wings!  My girlfriend bit into one and it was still frozen on the inside! Opened up mine with a fork and had the same results. Could not believe it!  Bartenders where very embarrassed. Maybe someone should be watching the cooks more closely. Apparently serving fresh food is to difficult for this place!"}
{"text":"I have ate all kind of food in my life Asian, Middle East, traditional American and fusion. We were here for Epic training and stop here form local recommendation. I ordered Chickn and Waffle. And I am not even like chicken that much..  Wow!!  It was so good.. So GOOD!  So good that I  want to move to Madison. Unfortunately, we are staying here only a few more days. Hope we cross path again.. I know the chance is slim to none..   Thank you for a wonderful surprise in the gravy."}
{"text":"Fantastic Beers! Awesome selection! Food was OK. So far my favorite brewery in Madison with a ton of beers. Overall shared sample with a buddy and tried 12 unique brews (all brewed by Vintage). Only 2 out of the 12 were not very good. Highly recommend trying Dedication, Brett-ication, and Trepidation (my fav).   Had a southwest chicken salad to try and eat healthy, but I didn't look close enough at the description. It was breaded and the lettuce was on the side in one big chunk with a ton of rice. The description is (Cornmeal and pistachio crusted chicken breast served with a grilled romaine wedge, white rice, fire roasted corn salsa, pineapple pico de gallo, avocado and a generous amount of cilantro lime sauce.) It was exactly that. Good but not that healthy for what I wanted.   Definitely would go back and recommend this place for the beer, atmosphere, and food."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they really excel with their brews. The Belgian styles that they turn out have all been amazing.   If you're out of town, it's a must stop. If you're local, you already know."}
{"text":"Amazing beers, yummy food & friendly staff!  Favorites here are the curds and mac & cheese."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the latest trend in Madison restaurants is in charging it's patrons $8-9 for a very small basket of cheese curds?? The Vintage is no exception here. My stomach and wallet both kind of wept when the appetizer came out. They tasted just fine, but damn.  I ordered the Honey Pecan Chicken Salad sandwich as my entree. I generally love chicken salad, and this was an interesting twist to it. It was just way too sweet and I couldn't finish it - and I've got a bit of a sweet tooth. Their seasoned fries were pretty bland and gross, too. My partner enjoyed his meal, which was the Big Dixie. Idunno, the sandwch looked like a heart attack in the making to me."}
{"text":"First timer. Server recommended our dishes. Good food. Good brew. I will go back."}
{"text":"New local brewpub that took over the location of what was a chain restaurant. Great atmosphere, very friendly staff. I'm vegetarian but thought the food was great - not just mine but my husbands as well, and he's no vegetarian. Simple menu based on WI classics: mac & cheese, roasted vegetable salad, burgers... not greasy or freakish, just well prepared and reasonably priced food.  No news on their locally brewed beer yet (because its not done a'brewing) but their beer list is outstanding. YES, outstanding.   One final thing - we sat here with computers writing in the bar area for a good 2 hours and they staff was great to us. Free wireless. Great spot - recommended."}
{"text":"Server rolled her eyes at us when asked to see if we could still order the beef stroganoff. Last time we were there the kitchen made it for my wife even though it wasn't on the menu. I understand servers make low wages but still humor me to see if the item could still be made. Could be why no one was in the restaurant on Sunday. It will be quite a while before I come back. Poor service is really unbecoming."}
{"text":"If you enjoy $4.00 Spotted Cows this is your place. I was here just to kill time and wanted to try one of their brews, however for a glass of their micro brew you had to dish out some serious cash. What if I don't like it? It's hard to like a place that overcharges for beer. The inside of the restaurant is very modern and I'm really not sure what the place used to be. Don't let the crappy exterior appearance throw you off. The inside has this cool vibe as mentioned above. Location is ok, what else is on Whitney way besides a grocery store and some strip mall discount stores? It would be nice to see a place like this in a more open piece of land to allow for more parking and better entrance and egress."}
{"text":"Their rotating beer selection is legit. A staple year round selection is the McLovin"}
{"text":"I was passing by Vintage and  some of the previous reviews made the sandwiches worth a try.  I was seated promptly and given a menu, the waiter showed up quickly - asked if I wanted a drink besides water - I did not.  The waiter came back a few minutes later - asked if i was ready and I ordered a pastrami sandwich.  I enjoy horseradish (which the sandwich came with) and was looking forward to giving it a try.  The waiter asked which side i wanted (I hadn't looked and said so) he waited patiently without saying word....  i selected tater tots and off he went...  No specials, no talking me though the sides... hmmmm.    The sandwich arrived with very little wait, the marble rye bread looked inviting - the horseradish as it turned out had been slathered on like heavy mayo and totally over-powered the meat  - I ended up eating it open face.  the tots were good which i wasn't really expecting.  Two gents got seated at the next table, same waiter came over - asked about drinks and when they were about ready to order he gave them a complete run down off all the specials without being asked.  When it was time to do the sides, again - he volunteered info that I hadn't received,,,  game breaker?  No but it did lower the service level for me.  It wasn't enough for me to talk to someone but the visit wasn't enough to bring me back either - not with so many other places in and around Madison doing well.  I would have given 2.5 stars if half stars were allowed.  Rounding up to 3 was acceptable."}
{"text":"This is probably a sacrilege but I'm not a huge fan of beer. That being said, their scotch ale was really good. It was oddly light and had notes of caramel with a clean finish. Their stout was waaay bitter and devoid of the coffee notes you'd normally expect from a stout, but would pair well with a dessert, I think.   Anyway, as far as the food goes, I was floored. They have this menu item called Irish Nachos. It's thick, crispy potato slices with bacon, ranch, and herbs on top (and probably other stuff but I'm drawing a blank). Srsly, it's phenomenal. I also had their \"locavore\" burger option, the Home Grown Burger. Local, grass-fed beef with white cheddar, apple slices, arugula, and an apple cider reduction sauce with a side of black pepper aoli. Oh yeah--I asked for it done medium, and it was cooked perfectly. I'm pretty sure the clouds parted and I heard singing when I took my first bite. Then I ate until I wanted to die...and I would have died happy.  Also, I had this near-cathartic food experience while warming up by their fireplace and watching some bizarre, dated, bawdy Britcom/musical on the television. All in all, an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Well I will preface this review with the fact that I was here for dinner and not for drinks. It seems like a great place to grab a beer. However here are my thoughts on the food. I got the fish fry and it was ok. Nothing to brag about but decent.   The place is noisy so if you are looking for a place to have a conversation this is not the best venue. But it is large so it is good for a bigger group of people, which is how I ended up here."}
{"text":"3.5 really. Good beers, massive food portions, a bit loud and difficult at times to have a conversation. The hostess greeted us promptly as we walked in but we chose to find seats at the bar. The decor was kinda cool with the walls lined with vintage beer paraphernalia and hanging lamps, but also a bit odd for a craft brewery to have so much macro-brewery heritage on display. Their location amongst the strip malls was also odd and parking was limited however many people were their to catch the shuttle to the Great Taste so it probably is not always that bad. The lighting was very dim for daylight hours but not annoying. We had to ask for menus, but that just tells me they get a lot of local business and both their food and beer menus were impressive. I started out with The Grodz and followed up with Velouria which was pleasantly pungent peach wheat beer. The nacho platter I ordered was mammoth and dense, loaded with cheese, pulled pork, veggies, salsa and sour cream. I barely finished a quarter of it. My buddy's grilled meatball burger was largely proportioned as well but I think we'd both try smothering else the next time. The beers were really the stars here and while they don't offer a traditional flight they do offer taster glasses for $1.50 that you can pick choose for your self. The bartenders were busy and a bit gruff but never rude, they just didn't appear to have the time to be more helpful or friendly as some others have mentioned. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"*Immensely* improved over JT Whitney's, which I thought was horribly depressing. It's been redone to be simple, warm, and comforting, with nice views of the ginormous fermentation tanks. No news on the home brewed beer yet, but great to have a solid brew pub on the West side.  Great local beer list, super solid pub food. I had the fish n chips and was pleased. Camped out on their free wireless without hassle at all. Just what the West side needed."}
{"text":"Beer-wise they have all the bases covered here with everything from a blond wit to an imperial stout with lots of credit for incorporating a nicely varied smattering of guest taps too!  Food-wise the name of the game is creativity - from my delicious deep-fried pot roast balls to the capresse grilled cheese to the seared ahi sandwich special...we are big fans!"}
{"text":"Average food, average drinks, crowded all the time. They have some good specials on off peak days, and a nice patio. Super loud college bar, a little pricey."}
{"text":"The Vintage isn't my favorite brewery-restaurant combo in Madison, but that probably says more about this city's plethora of glorious brewery-restaurant hybrids than the Vintage. I used to come here more often when they had trivia (frankly, I'm not sure why they stopped - the place was PACKED for it on Tuesdays). I can't give it a much higher score, though, due to some snafus that I've had while dining here.  First, the good stuff. When everything goes according to plan, the staff is friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The beers are excellent, and there are almost always specials of one sort or another on various drinks. Hibiscus Saison isn't often in season or in stock, but when it is, it's a tart, fruity glass of deliciousness and quite possibly my favorite summer beer. A welcome surprise is their mixed drinks, which often fall to the side in brewpubs. Their sangria is a personal favorite. As far as food goes, I'm a fan of the cheese curds (although they're quite greasy), the meatloaf sandwich, and the Big Sky burger. The bathrooms are well-stocked (points for any bathroom that includes hand lotion at the sinks) and clean.  Now, for the less-good stuff. First, they won't seat your party until everyone is there. I know this is a common practice in most larger cities, but it's still enough to raise an eyebrow in Madison. Second, the beautiful outdoor patio has so much potential, but there are some significant problems. A lot of places will have some sort of mosquito deterrent in the form of citronella candles or torches, but that isn't the case here; I was eaten alive in the five minutes I was outside. Also, we had the misfortune of being seated directly under a pair of speakers with music so loud it was difficult to have a conversation; at times it even felt physically painful. On this occasion, my companion and I moved indoors due to these factors, making sure to speak to a server before we were moved indoors. This is where things began to unravel. The music was still extremely loud, especially considering this was a Monday night and the restaurant had very few people in it. There was only one other table of diners in our section, and it would seem that our move led to us being seated in customer purgatory, since neither of us could get a server's attention the vast majority of the time. There was one slightly-older female server who took pity on us whenever she saw us and made sure we had what we needed, made sure our food was tasting good, etc. However, I don't think it was her section, so we didn't see her often and would desperately try to flag down a server, sometimes waving our arms at the servers who congregated by the patio door to chat with each other and who were doing a great job at ignoring us. The noise level in general is fairly high, with practically nothing to dampen it. There are also some items on their menu that are ridiculous or bland/stale. The pretzel appetizer is tough and appalling. The spinach artichoke dip is fairly bland, and it would go much better with baguette slices than the tortilla chips that are served with it. The Irish nachos are anemic and fairly flavorless. And the grilled cheese cheeseburger - which substitutes an entire grilled cheese for each half of a burger bun - is a foot high, impossible to eat, revolting in concept, and seems like a transparent ploy to get Adam Richman to visit.  I'll still be back for more Hibiscus Saison, though. Mmm, beer."}
{"text":"This is a gem for the west side and so glad I found it!   I hesitated to go here for the appearance of the exterior. Plopped at the end of a parking lot for strip malls, and slightly dingy looking paint job made me wonder. But, was pleasantly surprised when we strolled in one Saturday afternoon for lunch to find a spacious yet cozy, updated dining area and bar. Good tunes too.  We've been here 4 or 5 times now for lunch and dinner. Portions are great. Apps are delicious - I've had the nachos, which are made with a homemade spicy nacho cheese sauce. And we've also had the f ried curds. These curds are far better than the great dane but not quite as good as the old fashioned, but give them a run for their money.   Burgers are delicious, juicy, perfectly cooked and thoroughly seasoned. Fries are those awesome fat steak fries (you can get waffle fries too I believe). And, they've got tots on the menu. HELLO! My husband says the black bean burger is the best he's had anywhere too.  Also super happy with the shredded pork mac & cheese - comfort food in a crock...imagine spicy shredded pork bbq topped off with bubbly mac & cheese. Super yum.   The beers I've had are tasty, and need to spend more time trying even more of them. The only thing I wish is that they had an outdoor area."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Loved the menu and the HUGE beer selection. Prices extremely reasonable. Highly recommend the 50/50 California BLT and meatball burgers. Like that you could make your own beer flight with as many beers you want. Will definitely return to this gem!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad, but nothing that great either. Some colleagues and I stopped in for lunch after some meetings, and we were happy with our meal and the service. We had some fried cheese curds as an appetizer, and w eloped them. Who doesn't like fried cheese? I ordered fish and chips, and everything tasted fine. I also had my friend's leftover sandwich, which was also good. Overall, no complaints. Just no standouts either. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"My mouth dropped open when given this huge yummy Bleu burger and twisty-type fries. How on earth can anyone finish a burger here? And fries?! If you can, geez, maybe get a different hobby.  Chris, you are an exceptional server, very kind and genuine. Thank you. We will be back, and I will get the gluten free bun just for kicks. And probably take it home anyways because it will be huge as well.   Love the patio when there's no kids and wanna be Kardashians. Great atmosphere inside; good lighting, good for small groups. I'll be back for the Crispin Cider too. And the dartboard I saw while rolling out."}
{"text":"Wow...we stumbled upon this place after flying in from the west coast. Super! Amazing beer selection, and delicious food. The pretzel appetizer was fantastic.  I had the veggie burger which was spicy with great flavor.  We sat at a table next to the bar which was lively and entertaining. If we are in the area, we will go back."}
{"text":"15 DELICIOUS micro brews on tap, and we tried a sample of them all, all fantastic. Full, local and organic menu- the fish tacos were spicy and delicious. Our waiter was awesome, friendly and had great recommendations. A little more expensive than the surrounding spots but totally worth the extra buck!!"}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday and of course they had a fish fry.  The nice thing about the place was that it did not overwhelming smell like fish.  This is a definite plus.  It was crowded and loud, which of course at a brewery you would expect.  However, it is was borderline annoying as you could barely converse.  My group had the Irish Nachos as an appetizer.  They were ok but not for the price.  It is a loaded baked potato cut into slices.  I will pass it on if I were you.  It is just nothing outstanding.  I had the BBQ Mac & Cheese.  It was amazing.  It comes in a casserole dish and the pork is baked under the noodles.  The presentation was beautiful, the meal was delicious and it was definitely worth more than the price.  My husband had the fish.  It comes with 1, 2 or 3 pieces.  The pieces are as long as the plate.  He was very satisfied with his food and had to take a piece home.  He ordered the 2 piece meal.   Overall, I give it a 3.  I liked it, I loved my dish, but the overall atmosphere just did not make me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Love love love Vintage Brewing Co! The atmosphere is mircobrew/supper club/grandma's house circa 1960. Beer list is varied and the drink list is full of fun retro cocktails. The menu is awesome! If you love good burgers and comfort food, this is the place. Other than the burgers and sandwiches the rest of the entree menu feels a little like what you might expect to be fed for a Sunday night family dinner. The cheese curds are amazing!  My only complaint they've taken seasoned fries off the menu. Bring back the ranch fries!"}
{"text":"Have you even had their beer! Seriously though, try the beer. The Scaredy Cat Oatmeal Stout is great -my stand by order. The Shadow Planet is friggin dreamy, a must try!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the positives. Great food, prices, waitstaff and location. It's a lot more mellow and upscale than the downtown location and great for watching a football game. The food is great. The menu is fairly standard, but the quality of the food is the real kicker! It always tastes freshly prepared and very flavorful. They have some solid apps too. I may go back just for those.  Oh, Vintage, how I want to be impressed with your beers, but am continually disappointed. Out of the four or five beers I've had from Vintage, I've never loved a single one."}
{"text":"Oatmeal Stout, Yes!  Fish Fry, Yes! Great bar burgers, Yes!  The Vintage is clearly a great place to have a social gathering or just a random Friday night.  If you love beer, you will love the Vintage.  When you order food, you will most likely be taking some of it home. They give you decent servings. Plus, if your like me you will be filling up on beer as well.... This place is hit or miss for service. They're really busy Friday and Saturdays. But, if you have an evening during the week I would suggest hitting it up. Plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"Love this place! !  Great food, awesome  service and nice atmosphere!  We've been here several times and the food and service is consistently wonderful."}
{"text":"Our first dining experience living in Madison! Will not be our last, either. Vintage has a dozen or so of their own brews to showcase. I had a pint of the bees' knees - an excellent honey beer that hosts the actual mouthfeel of a spoonful of honey. I ordered the quinoa cakes with chicken. Wasn't what I was expecting- pretty bland considering the ingredients. Chicken came out like chicken tenders. Service was great and decor is fun."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite restaurants by far! I have such a hard time finding restaurants to eat at, and when in doubt Vintage is always on my mind! Love the food you honestly cannot go wrong with what you order! Burgers are great, specials and not to mention the beer! Also service has always been great, had maybe one bad experience but that doesn't mean the restaurant deserves to get their points docked. It happens! Anyways vintage food is great! Eat everything!!!"}
{"text":"Since my first review, I've had the fortune of visiting Vintage and having dinner at least eight times. I have yet to find something on the menu I don't like. And now that they've opened the patio, they've become one of my favorite places for summer dining. Try the fish tacos, the BBQ Mac & Cheese (it sounds like stoner food, but it's amazing), or the meat loaf sandwich. If you're not in the mood for rich fare, the buffalo chicken wrap is awesome. And, of course, the beer menu is variable and delightful, but probably best for those with an adventurous palate."}
{"text":"I have always had good experiences at Vintage. Great selection of beer and a variety of tasty food.  I had the fish tacos which were very good. My girlfriend had the chicken caesar salad which she said was also good.   Quick service and fair prices.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight after relocating to Madison.  My wife and I were really happy with it.  Reds have long been my favorite beer, and the McLovin' was as good a red as I've had in a long time.  The chicken and waffles were very good as well.  The chicken was absolutely perfectly cooked.  I was surprised when the plate came that the kitchen didn't trust me to know how much syrup to add to this whole delightful monstrosity, but it turns out they were right and I probably would have screwed it up if I did it myself.  Two minor dings, but I'll have to update after I've been back a few more times: the waffles were a little doughy and underdone, and the cheese curd app we had wasn't wonderful, but it was good enough.  Also, yay for having a changing table in the men's room.  Now we can bring the kid and I can not worry about shirking diaper changing duties due to lack of facilities.  It's the little things."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem! vintage may not look like much on the outside, but the inside is super cool and the food is delicious! We were there at night with friends for drinks (get the cucumber mixed drink if you can - it's super refreshing and tasty) and there was a fantastic selection of beers and mixers. Bar was super crowded so service was a bit slow (about 5-10 minutes to get a bartenders attention and get your drinks), but that was to be expected and the drinks are big enough that you don't have to go back multiple times.   We came back the next day for food, and it was even better than expected. They serve a wide variety of entrees and we were all very happy with our meal. I got the sweet chili chicken wrap, my fiancé got the Ruben, my sister the grilled cheese, and my dad the jalapeño burger...none of us were disappointed. Service was fast and our server had great reccomendations. Can't wait to get back and try more foods!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a solid rotating beer list that is brewed in house. If you enjoy craft beers I would recommend giving their brews a try. Another bonus is you can take their beer to-go. They have a cooler up front with pre bottled/canned beer.   I really enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant/bar as a whole. I can truly say this is one of the few places I feel comfortable enjoying a beer by myself. The staff are very friendly as well.  There are a handful of items on the menu that are my go to's. One being the BBQ Mac n Cheese. It is the perfect balance of cheesy, with a bite of spiciness at the bottom from the BBQ pulled pork.   The Stroganoff is always a great alternative if you are not a fan of spicy. This is a more refined topped with sirloin and truffle sauce.  If you are looking for something hearty during the fall/winter months I also highly suggest the Chili. It does have a bit of a kick to it. But I love spicy food so I enjoyed it a lot.   Overall it is a solid 4 stars from me. I would have given them 5 stars but there were a few times I ordered the BBQ Mac n Cheese and it came out a bit watery (they didn't drain the noodles enough). Even with that mishap, I still order that dish just about every time!"}
{"text":"I've come here for specific items over the past few years and wanted to like the atmosphere. Each visit has been disappointing with lackluster service and food. Pretzels, I think they want to pass them as homemade but they aren't hot nor tasty - seem like frozen from a box. If they are house made there is no indication in flavor, texture, temp, or appearance. The most recent dinner the entire table ended up with soggy, tasteless fish and chips when we were all craving a Friday Fish Fry and VBC was the nearest restaurant. I was salting that fish like crazy to no avail. Also, if the chips are supposed to be house made they are not fresh fried. It's just cold chips which are unappealing. I wish the food could be hot, fresh, and visually appealing, because I like the idea of VBC but the food consistently is disappointing."}
{"text":"The vintage has been a great place to stop and grab a drink with co-workers, but not somewhere I would suggest to go for dinner. The food is typical bar food... mostly fried. At my most recent visit I grabbed the chicken sliders appetizer. It came as three sliders with more fried onions on top than anyone could ever want or need.  I was a little disappointed to see that the chicken was ground up and then formed into a patty rather than a solid piece. On top of that, I had asked for no bacon and instead was given sliders with bacon and no cheese. Our server was quick to correct the problem and it was evident that my food was actually re-made, which I appreciated. However, I don't think I would order it again.   The restaurant has a large square bar area that has always seems to be packed. There is separate seating in the back of the restaurant with patio seating in the summer. We were seated right away on a Monday evening and there is plenty of parking outside. My friend had a $3 beer for happy hour which she thought was pretty good... although, I wasn't impressed with my mixed drink. Overall, worth stopping in at least once. Definitely check it out and see what you think."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: 3 Uniqueness: 4  ---------------------------------------------------------------- The Vintage is a delicious option for date night - just not too often.  The menu offering is really unique but most options are heart stopping. I'm fairly certain this place keeps the population of Dane County's cardiologists in business. It's all delicious but mostly fried or covered in sauces.  Do the right thing and order tots as your side. Also, the pork belly bites are probably one of the most insanely fatty delicious things I've ever had - deep fried porkbelly covered in thai sweet chili sauce."}
{"text":"holy cow.  or fish.  We went to the Vintage for a work celebration lunch with about 12 people.  The service was good and we sat next to the fireplace.  The food was fantastic.  I had the fish sandwich and pub fries which was excellent.  The sandwich had 2 huge pieces of breaded fish and a toasted bun with a pitch-perfect sauce.  I took 1/2 the sandwich home as did 2 others.  The pub fries were as expected and delicious.  Others had the meatloaf which was good and grilled cheese did please.  I would go again, maybe have some beer this time."}
{"text":"Ranks as some of the best burgers in town. One of the few go to places on the west side.  Beer is great and don't forget to ask about their cask offerings. Only complaint is they do a horrible job updating their draft list and never have any info on the casks."}
{"text":"I like the decor and it is a good idea, but the food was meh."}
{"text":"Went a couple weeks ago, so I don't have the particulars. However, with a small but unique menu, good prices, and good staff, as well as some tasty brew, we will definitely be making another trip. Pits the old jt Whitney's to shame."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped at Vintage Brewing for Friday evening Happy Hour. My review is focused on the food, service and atmosphere. We ordered the Spinach Dip, Fried Cheese Curds, Loaded Potato Bites and Asian Pork Belly Bites. The best app by far was the Loaded Potato Bites--presentation, flavor and size. Cheese curds were not hot in terms of temp. I like my curds hot! The Spinach Dip was average with lots of dipping options. Now to the Asian Pork Belly Bites...sorry not a fan...grisly and tough.   I agree with another reviewer that to get served at the bar was tough. I had to move to an opposite side of the bar after waiting a bit to get acknowledged.   A plus on the atmosphere you get visibility into the brewing area where the magic happens."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Madison restaurants. Came in for some of the famous \"It's Not Your Mama's Stroganoff\" and was bummed that it was removed from the menu.  The BBQ Mac and Cheese and curds were great."}
{"text":"Great menu, lots of items to choose from! However, if its Friday- get the fish fry! Do it and thank me later. They also offer tater tots on the side, which is kind of my favorite thing ever."}
{"text":"I've waffled between 4 and 5 stars for vintage but I'm back to 5.  Our last 2 visits the service was perfect.  We had a long hiatus between the last visit and the one before and the menu seems to have been greatly expanded while we were away.    One detail that has never waivered - the beer has been superb from day one and only ever gotten better.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I don't know... it's okay.  Everything just seemed pretty mediocre, but I realize it's not easy to please everybody every single night so maybe I picked a bad one.  I'd probably give it another shot sometime for beers and apps."}
{"text":"good beers, friendly staff, fun atmosphere and great fish tacos on thursday"}
{"text":"This was my second time at vintage. I had the home grown burger and it was off the charts. I washed that down with their IPA and the Pumpkin Disorderly (a pumpkin ale that only comes out this time of year) awesome place to grab a beer and some quality food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Brewing may be the claim to fame here, but this place REALLY knows how do to a burger right.   I had the Home Grown Burger today, and it was absolute perfection. I ordered it medium rare, and it came out thick and juicy, and made a mess all over the plate when I bit into it - which is exactly what I want from a burger. There were sharp notes from the aged white cheddar cheese, sweet from the crunchy apple slices, tanginess from the apple cider reduction, and a subtle peppery bite from the arugula and black pepper aioli. I'm pretty sure that when the waiter came by to ask how everything was, I just made a ridiculous MMMMMMMMM sound.   I realize that brewing is this place's claim to fame, but I was there for a business lunch, and could not sample any of the tempting concoctions. But with a burger like that, I didn't miss it. I also need to point out that this menu features something called the \"Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger\"- which is a burger with ham, two fried eggs, cheese, and onions, sandwiched between grilled cheese sandwiches. I could never order something like that, but I appreciate that it exists.   We ordered the brownie sundae for dessert, and were pretty disappointed with the tough consistency of the brownie, but the burger was so good, I'm not taking away a star."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed tonight!! I've been here once  before and it was good. The server girl had a terrible attitude and service. Walked right past the table numerous times, and she didn't approach when other people of our party came. We wanted to switch romaine for iceberg lettuce and that was too much by the look on her face. The wraps and burgers were DRENCHED in sauce and they were inedible. It was just really bad and super disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Vintage is a solid place to get together with friends. I've mostly been here for happy hour, but I've also dined for lunch, dinner, and late night as well. Portions are large, the menu changes every now and again, and they seem to make everything in house, which is great. Vintage also brews their own beer, and my most common order is the Bee's Knees (please). I recently sampled their hibiscus brew and that was really tasty and perfect for summer.  Since most of my visits have been for happy hour, I'll focus on that: + $1 off most taps and $3 rails + they are happy to split appetizers across several checks + the totchos can't be in any way good for you except for the endorphin release you get from how delicious they are - tater tots topped with homemade queso sauce, barbecue pulled pork chili, corn, cheese, and jalepenos - we have a serious obsession with these + a lovely outdoor patio and quiet back room if you want to have a more intimate conversation  - you can't participate in the happy hour specials if you sit outside, which is super weird - you can go inside to order your drinks, but then you're stiffing your server - occasionally servers are a little out of it, either not super concerned about checking in/serving us or seeming distracted when they are  The tasty food and drinks and the friendliness of the staff far outweigh those minor quibbles though, hence making it a spot we return to again and again."}
{"text":"A must-stop in the Madison area for any beer lover, though enjoying some suds is certainly not required.  Vintage has a large tap list of house-brewed beers, many of which are award winning, all of which are delicious and with plenty of styles to chose from, there's something for everybody.  The food? Exceptional. I haven't had a since thing that wasn't absolutely satisfied with if not overly impressed by which seems to be the case more often than not. My two personal favorites which are increasingly hard to divert from when I'm out there are the buffalo chicken sandwich and bruschetta chicken sandwich; both are nothing short of orgasmic. The fries make for a great side for both and I haven't had a bad service experience there yet!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on a Friday night just to try a few of their brews.  We had already eaten and just wanted to finish off the evening with some suds.  We got a flight of 5 beers the first time and then another 4, so we had a good assortment to judge on.  The ones that stood out were the Hibiscus Saison, Jinja Ninja, Trepidation and Dedication.  The winner was Dedication followed closely by Trepidation, yum yum yum yum yum!   When we are back in town we will definitely swing by again and maybe try the food this time :)"}
{"text":"Awesome good food. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and these awesome twisted fries. Waitress was spot on and kept the refills coming."}
{"text":"We went in to order take out because my cousin had recommended the pork bellies.  It was really delicious.  It is cubed pork bellies that are fried and glazed.  You dip them in this wasabi sauce.  I love that wasabi sauce so much.   I didn't order anything else so I don't have a comment on those.  Also did not interact enough with the staff to comment/rate on that.  The interior of the bar is really cool and relaxing.  I sat in a sofa while I waited for my order."}
{"text":"Big fan of the burgers, especially the Home Grown. And the beer selection here, all made in house, is vastly superior to the *ahem* competition brewpubs nearby. Outdoor seating is also very relaxing-- Vintage can be a quiet place for dinner at 7pm or a raucous place for beers with friends at 10pm. They have a considerable amount of live music as well."}
{"text":"Recently, I have been to The Vintage several times in a short time period and I have to say this place isn't bad!  Typically I am here for late night drinks but recently I have tried the food here as well.  The service every time I visit is great.  You are greeted at the door and given your seating options.  I typically will go to the bar and grab a seat there.  I must say that I have never had poor service at the bar.  The bartenders are always pleasant, helpful, and efficient.  We had dinner there recently and the waiters maintained the same level of service.  We ordered their pork belly appetizers which is of course deep fried but also delicious!  I ordered the chicken and waffles and really enjoyed it.  The chicken and waffles were extra crispy which is nice because it comes with gravy and syrup so there was no sogginess anywhere in sight!  My husband ordered the mac and cheese on the recommendation of the server.  I thought this was a bad idea and though I hate to admit it, I was wrong!  The mac and cheese was da bomb!  It was the best that I think I have had anywhere; even better than homemade.  There was a nice helping of shredded pork at the bottom of it that added to the flavor.  I like the Vintage and can't believe I have only recently opened myself up to their food options.  Though their menu is small if the rest of the items are anything like what we've had there so far I should be in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Can't quite figure this place out.  They brew onsite, and some of the beers are really good.  Others, almost undrinkable.  And, the interior is really odd.  Diner furniture mixed with wood tables and a modern looking bar?  Decent menu, but as others have noted, uneven service.  Long wait, on Thursday night, but largely because tables sat unbused endlessly."}
{"text":"This place is perfect!  Can't wait til they open up in Sauk City on the river!  McLovin is the best."}
{"text":"It kills me to do this because 3 of us had an amazing experience here. My BF however had a meal that should not have been served to a dog! I understand things happen on accident, but how they handled it was disgusting.  I wont even go into details of my good food because I would never go back. My BF was trying really hard not to complain and ate half of his grilled cheese. He finally could not take it anymore and opened it up and showed me what they served him. It was literally a slice of white bread not even grilled and ONE PIECE OF COLD AMERICAN CHEESE.   We figured this had to be a mistake. He nicely showed our waiter. He took it away and came back only to tell us they took $3.50 off our bill since he did eat the other half. I have no issue paying but when you send crap like that out of your kitchen then slap us in the face with 3.50 off? NO!   Management needs to get it together. Or maybe they don't focus entirely on food here since the bar does so well. I will say the bartenders make some amazing drinks!"}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I'd been here - although I can't really remember why. Because now, I really want to go back. I was here with some friends a couple of weeks ago, and we got a table outside after only a couple of minutes wait. Sure, it looks over Whitney Way and the parking lot, but it's a really nice outdoor patio! We enjoyed some appetizers to start. If you're wondering if you should try to pork belly bites - yes, yes you should. You definitely should. We also tried the fried pickles. They were good (not too much breading and still crunchy) but not amazing. For dinner I very very much enjoyed the jalapeño burger. I would definitely order that again; but really it was the fries that were oh so good. For the life of me, I can't remember the name the beer I liked, but it had juniper in it. I'm sure it will jun-ip-out at you if you're looking at the menu! I thought the service was quite good. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Come here everytime I am in town! Being from San Diego I love craft beer and Vintage Brewing is spot on. They are just courageous enough to make unique and delicious beers, but also have very well balanced options! Also the food is fantastic! Get the pork belly bites! Lisa is great!"}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 6 for some dinner. Our sever was friendly and relaxed, and the food here was pretty good; tasty, big portions, and exactly what you'd expect from a brewery.   Our group mostly kept to ourselves since it was our first time here but it seemed like there were many regulars that the servers and bartenders knew--sort of like this was the regular stomping grounds for some--and that seemed like it was a big draw for the place.  The experience at this place doesn't really stand out to me too much but it wasn't a bad experience for me and my group at all and I think we'd be happy to come back again sometime."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Madison for pub food. Solid menu with good options.   First thing to realize: amidst its Americana retro decor, Vintage leans more towards gastropub rather than straight-up pub fare. What that means is you'll find a culinary twist on classic favorites along with a wide beer selection that includes seasonal brews - for example, peruse the burger menu and you'll come across \"charred scallion aioli\", \"baby greens\" and mushroom pate in their version of the Mushroom and Swiss burger. Just realize that you may not find an exact rendition of a classic dish and you won't be disappointed. (Most notably, there isn't a \"signature\" burger that resembles a 'classic' American burger, so the 'build-your-own' route is your next best option.)   For the families, the kids menu is decent - I haven't found anything that really stands out.  Pro tip - Vintage shines in their sides. While all the sides are all excellent, the tater tots alone - yes they have tater tots! - would steal the show. The chef's side salad is probably the best side salad in town - it's a spring salad mix with fresh vegetable additions.   Dish(es) that I've liked: their fried fish (whether stand-alone or in a sandwich) always came up tasty. Dish(es) I didn't like: the Big Dixie was dense and somewhat cloying with the cheese and the BBQ sauce combo.  Vintage gets 4.5 stars but rounding down due to price. While prices are affordable, your dollar doesn't seem to go as far as it does with other similar, brewery establishments such as the Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"Edit: OK thank Kara for turning this review around. She was attentive and totally on it tonight. Food was still awesome. You've changed out minds about Vintage... Congrats =)    Well get it to go please.  That's what we should have said.  Their food was great. Plenty of portions, great quality, and good prices.  The service was horribly lacking. From the front desk girl who seemed confused, our waitress who never checked on us, and the other waiter we flagged down for drinks that forgot about us totally.. we won't be dining in again."}
{"text":"Second time here and I'll be coming back again and again. The first time I had the pork belly bites, pretty much an orgasm in your mouth."}
{"text":"We spent the day at Devil's Lake doing some kayaking, so by the time we crawled in I was thirsty for a good beer or two and running on empty.  Vintage Brewing coddled both needs handily.   Vintage has about 15 of their own crafts on tap, which is pretty impressive given their size (average restaurant).  That translates into a diverse beer menu with a little bit of everything.  I'm not an Irish Red fan but couldn't help noticing all of the awards next to their McLovin selection on the menu..so I gave it a whirl.  I'm very glad I did.  Best Irish Red I've ever had, hands down.  I was pretty tired and didn't want to get into a second beer at dinner.  So I asked our waitress for a small pour of Sarsaparilla Killa, a Belgian Black ale with molasses, dark cocoa, black licorice and old fashioned root beer stirred in.  Yeah...that's what I said...that's one hell of a concoction!  It's smoother than it sounds and has a nice flavor.   Quato literally resided in my stomach so dinner couldn't arrive fast enough, which was the 50/50 Cali BLT.  Here's the menu story: \"Equal parts of house ground beef & bacon compose this beautiful burger. Topped with pepper jack cheese, avocado, chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomato, onion and a fried egg on a Parker House roll\". That's what I call awesomeness on a bun!  I inhaled the damn thing as well as the mashed taters on the side.  After eating I felt like another beer but also faced 140 miles to get home, so I capitulated.   Next time I'm back in Madison this place has a strong chance of seeing my mug.  Top notch everything across the board. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about Vintage.  They used to be one of my favorite places to go, and to take people who were visiting from out of town. Their beer selection is fantastic, they had a number of great gluten-free options on the menu, and my only complaint was that it gets *really* crowded/noisy on the weekends.  Their tater tots are fantastic. Their signature drink, a Jack Kerouac, is one of my favorites. Their selection of micro-brews is incredible.  But every time the menu gets revised, more GF options disappear. Last time I was in, I was excited to try a couple of their new burgers, only to be met with a perplexing response from our waitress. On my previous visit, our server had told me they have GF buns (though they're not on the menu) and the burgers have always been a GF staple for me there.  *This* waitress, however, insisted (after supposedly checking with the owner) that there were also bread crumbs in the burger patties (even though this is something I've checked a number of times over the years, and was assured they didn't) -- anyone who serves high-quality burgers doesn't need bread crumbs in them! Save it for the meatloaf!  So why, my dear Vintage, do you offer gluten-free burger buns and then put bread crumbs in the burgers?  After this last fiasco, there's not much left I can eat on the menu except for a salad.  This makes me sad."}
{"text":"I usually come her for dinner. I drink beer and enjoy their good dinner menu. I went for a brunch today but their menu was very limited. Instead, I tried a lunch menu, which was a hamburger. I would say that I was bit disappointed at their burger. In addition, some of customers were very loud. Not a good lunch experience."}
{"text":"I'm a self proclaimed \"ale conner\".  Vintage Brewing passes inspection.  There is a wide craft beer selection - over 10 house taps as well as about 6 rotating guest taps - IPA/APA, saisons, stout, wheats, Belgians, pale ales, Irish red, ESB, and others that defy classification.  They also have bottles and cans, primarily for the non-craft beer drinkers.  The food is moderately priced and fantastic - burgers, wraps, salads, steak, pot pie, meat loaf!   Also, they offer deep fried tater tots as a side!  There are plenty of TVs to catch a ball game, but Vintage is not a sports bar."}
{"text":"I only had the beer, but I was very happy with this brewery's take on a wheat beer. The bar is very nice and designed in a square with the tvs and bartenders in the middle. There's a nice litte fishtank in the middle as well. The crowd was pretty small for a super bowl night, but decent. There was also an adjacent bar with table tops for two and stools. If you are staying in Middleton and are not trying to travel too far into Madison, this is a good stop."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and foosball! Go fight win"}
{"text":"This was my first and last experience at the Vintage. My friend and I were looking for a place to eat lunch on a late Sunday afternoon. We found a coupon for buy 1 lunch and get 1 free so we thought we could get some really nice food at a decent price. The experience was horrible from the start. We walked in and it was not busy at all. We had to wait about 3-5 minutes before the hostess returned from the bathroom to greet us and seat us. While waiting the bartender awkwardly looked over but did not offer to help and two other staff members saw us waiting and not being greeted and did not help. We asked to be seated outside because it was such a nice afternoon. As the hostess seated us outside, we said \"Why is no one else seated outside?..It is such a nice day!\" Her remark was, \"There was a possibility of storms earlier. Everyone else must just be pus****.\"  My friend and I were a little taken back by the hostess using such vulgar language. it would not be my first choice of words to use to your guests sitting down to eat lunch. In my opinion that is an offensive term.   The server was very slow to get out to us and take our order. He was very monotone and had no desire to be at work it seemed like. He was hard to understand and not friendly. We ordered the buffalo ranch chicken wrap and the sweet chili chicken wrap. They were nothing special and I could make wraps better than what they served. My friend asked for ranch and it was forgotten and he did not bring it out until he was reminded and by then we were almost finished with lunch. If she had waited for the ranch the fries and wrap would have been cold by then. Again, for a Sunday afternoon when the place was empty it did not seem like an arduous task.  Upon leaving the restaurant, we walked by two staff members who did not say anything or make eye contact or hold the outside door to the patio or the door to leave. It just seems like if you are going to be in the service industry, you should try to offer better service to your customers.   Very mixed feelings about this place, as I believe it is a decent place to grab drinks, but it will be very hard for me to go back."}
{"text":"Wow! For a place trying to build up a business, you'd think they'd be interested when an actual customer shows up at the bar. I came in looking for a friend I was meeting for lunch and was ignored as I searched the place to find him. When I couldn't find him, I sat down at the bar and was again ignored by all the employees who were busy doing whatever employees do when there are very few customers in a place. It always troubles me when I have no trouble seeing employees at a bar and they have trouble seeing me. Were there invisible customers lining the bar on either side of me? Was I invisible? Are they not paid to scan for customers? I don't know, but I walked out and waited for my friend at the ugly table outside in front of the building. I won't be giving this place another chance. And check out the almost identical post on Google."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous since when we pulled up it looked like the place would be on par with an Outback Steakhouse, Chilis or any other crappy chain restaurant.  I think it's just the unfortunate location (random stand alone building in a strip mall).  Well the food and beers were nothing like what you would get in a chain restaurant.  I felt such relief when the food started rolling out and everything looked cooked to order and fresh (not frozen and warming under a heat lamp).  Everything that we got was exactly how we wanted it to be and our server was attentive but with just the right amount of sarcastic snarkiness to make us all laugh and enjoy our food and drinks even more.  I can't remember what I ate (sad) but I remember I got to order a Raspberry Tart on tap (god I love Wisconsin beer) and I ordered the house vanilla soda with a shot of Pinnacle Whipped in it.  Sooo perfect together.  All in all, lunch at Vintage was perfect and I would come back again."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were okay. The BBQ Macaroni and cheese was awesome! The bloody mary wasn't anything special but good."}
{"text":"This was our second meal at Vintage and it was pretty good. I really love the decor/theme of the dining area. I had the BBQ Mac n Cheese. It was really yummy. Our server was prompt and friendly. My first experience at the Vintage was pretty lackluster. This is why I could only give 3 stars. I will go back again and see how things shake out."}
{"text":"Limited menu, food not very tasty or unique."}
{"text":"Vintage offers a solid range of tasty beer, and a menu of creative bar food that won't leave you disappointed.   The bar is a little bigger with several televisions and a beautiful salt water tank. The ambiance never lacks. If you're looking for a scrumptious meal, I recommend the Dixie sandwich, complete with bbq chicken and mac and cheese, plus a side.   The IPAs and ales tend to be crisp and/or smokey but not too filling, complimenting much of the food.  Only once have I ever had to wait awhile for a table, but the bar opened up faster which is always fine by me. Service has never been anything but good with servers and bartenders who are happy to make recommendations. As a little plus, the restrooms are larger and typically quite clean. It's a great place for winter nights or summer afternoons with plenty of options for all."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of beers on tap at a good price. I got the Rueben sandwich, and the corned beef was not good at all."}
{"text":"I've only been in to this location for the beer. And, it gets a 3 star. Compared to all the other craft beer in the Madison Area, I'm giving the beer here a 3 star rating. Service has been slower (even on slower days) compared to other venues. The selection of beers is OK and they do offer some options for people. I had an oatmeal stout this last time and it was OK. It was dark and had a creamy head, but lacked in a flavor profile. This is a great place to meet people after work, for lunch or a large party for dinner/drinks (get a reservation). They some bar seating and bar tables for casual get togethers. They do have a full section of more formal dining. Good location off the beltline on the west side. Looking at some of the other reviews, I may have to make a point to stop in for food one of these times."}
{"text":"Very nice brew pub to compliment the Madison beer scene. All the tastings in the beer flight were good. The food menu is also quite good. Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. I typically check-in about once a month or every two months. It's never too busy for happy hour and the food and drinks are good. If you plan on bringing a larger group during the dinner rush, you might run into a longer wait. Also, I love the outdoors patio. Great in the summer!"}
{"text":"This is a very fun place to go. The atmosphere is like stepping back into the 50's and they even have old black and white movies playing in the background.   The food is a B+, but also very reasonably priced. The Irish Nachos appetizers are excellent and they have good sandwiches. The fish tacos were also surprisingly good. The beers I've had are also great."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on the West side of Madison and am thinking food. I'm thinking BBQ Baked Mac & Cheese at Vintage Brewing Co. Not only is it one of the better mac n cheese out there...but it has spicy bbq pulled pork as a base then a nice layer of creamy pasta then topped with seasoned bread crumbs. It's a must try if you go.   And pretty much you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Their burgers are fantastic (Big Sky Burger is pretty badass). There's also the bacon-crusted meatloaf with a side of mash potatoes and veggies...pretty awesome indeed. And recently I just tried their Asian Pork Belly Bites from their appetizer menu, sweet and savory, melt in your mouth goodness served with wasabi/cilantro aioli. Muah.  And I'm giving this a five since they've found a way to really heighten up the flavors in American cuisine, providing it at affordable prices and they brew their own beer, which is another speciality they have.  http://www.getnmahbelly.com/2013/02/vintage-brewing-co/"}
{"text":"Large place with many booths, subdued lighting and lots of dark wood. Nice ambiance. Only stopped by to try their beer and sat at the bar which had a fantastically clean saltwater aquarium in the center. Friendly bartendress. We just had time for 2 of their drafts: the Weiss and the Belgian Dubbel. Thought the Weiss was excellent, thought the Dubbel was superb. I also like the fact that the Dubbel came in a goblet. I know its a smaller serving in the goblet, but the Dubbel was I recall 9.2% ABV so they never come in a larger size. We did not peruse the menu, but as I said, they must serve a lot of food because most of the place had booths and tables meant for dining. They had a side room besides the bar meant for drinking versus eating too. Some of the tap beer was available in 22 oz. bombers, but growlers were the main take home option."}
{"text":"If you like your beer served with a side of poseur attitude then this is the place for you. And are my girl and me the only people who can hear that mosquito beater whining over the completely convincing rap music?"}
{"text":"Heads up! Get to this place early if you want to eat there special.  5 stars for great tasting food, minus 2 for and an unfriendly hostess."}
{"text":"Vintage's overall rating is a 3.5 and that seems accurate.  We had planned on having lunch at the Old Fashioned but as usual Capitol Square was a total clusterf*#k. Plan B - lunch at Vintage because it was close to our destination and it was open. Turned out to be a pretty good call.  I love the interior - warm, and full of \"vintage\" touches. Like super awesome old beer lamps, rotary phones and great advertising art. They've got a big bar area which I'm sure is a great place to watch the Badgers.   The Mister started off with a stout ($5/pint) which he liked, and I went with a Moscow Mule, my drink was well made, properly served in a copper mug and reasonably priced at $6. We also had chese curds which were crispy, gooey snd very nice.  For lunch proper, he had the Home Grown burger which is served with arugula and fresh apple. That's not normally a thing he'd order but he loved it - I had a bite and was surprised at how well apples go on a burger. I went with the Gobble Gobble which is homemade pulled turkey, stuffing, homemade cranberry relish and a side of gravy (!) for dipping. I liked it but it was overly salty - maybe that comes from the stuffing? You'll have your choice of sides - go for the tots. Always go for the tots.  Service? Okay, not super attentive but very nice.  Hey Vintage, I've got an amazing menu idea for you. Take those tasty tots, pile on some of that homemade turkey and add some of that lovely gravy. Bam - THANKSGIVING POUTINE! Just remember where the idea came from when it gets you on the Food Network, okay?"}
{"text":"I am still working off my splurge here from the other weekend. The place is large and has a lot of unique offerings. The fish tank in the middle of the bar is very spectacular as well. There are many beverage options including in house and others as well. I like to see that they are not above serving other operation's good brewed options - class act.   The food is served in large portions and is very good. I definitely enjoyed my main and could not even begin to conquer the full thing. For a side I got the tots and while they were cooked to a golden brown the oil they were fried in tasted funny; like it was old or used one too many times. Or maybe I am just not a fan of the oil they use - I'd have to go back.  The price seemed right for what you got and the service was very friendly. I would definitely go back here if I was craving a unique twist to comfort food staples and a good beer."}
{"text":"I have not had a meal here yet, so I can't give it a better rating yet.  However, a few weeks ago, when the weather was still very warm, I had some drinks and appetizers on the outside deck and was very impressed.  Very good apps, vast beer selection, and great service.  It they keep doing this, they will be successful.  I will update my rating after I have a meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and have always enjoyed the food.  The popper burger is amazing!  The apps were pretty good too.  A little dimly lit which makes reading the menu difficult.  They are very accommodating, especially to larger groups."}
{"text":"Server karen:  Well... was served uncooked salmon, was re-served dry salmon on top of the same now cold rice and asparagus, split up our tab incorrectly.. we had to pay for the uncooked salmon. And all we could think about was whether or we thought it was rude to ask her to take the salmon off our tab, as they did not.  She was pleasant, though the mistakes changed the entire experience quite a bit."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed, complained that my chicken was undercooked and someone from the back came in and told me it wasn't pick and you should be fine.."}
{"text":"I went for the beer. I got a number of flights (5 oz) but got some cheese curds and soup.  The beers were ok, but I didn't find my flavor.  However, I did give it 5 stars because of the food. It was seriously the best soup I've ever tasted! The waitress was one of the nicest people I've ever met.  I just left dying to go back. Next time I visit Madison, I will be going there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while working in the area. It is a bar and grill type that plays on the vintage name with lots of chotchkie decorations that makes you feel like your grandma turned her house into a bar. We had the Wisconsin Fish Sandwich and the Patty Melt Reuben; both with tater tots. The fish sandwich had 2 big pieces of fried fish that were not greasy with fresh shredded lettuce and what tasted like house made tarter sauce. The Reuben was equally good as a different twist on a patty melt. Tater Tots were standard and there were several other side dish options I would try on future visits. The service was average, nothing really stands out good or bad; it was in the middle of lunch hour so the restaurant was almost full. Overall decent spot for lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Mushroom demi-glaze on the mushroom Swiss burger was absolutely amazing. Excellent non-greasy pub chips. Nice variety of veggies on the chef salad, but could have used more dressing. The innocuous-sounding cilantro lime vinaigrette is loaded with jalapeño so beware!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere. New patio overlooks Whitney Way. Drinks are good and the food is very good.   If you like the retro feel, the Vintage gives it. The old signs on the walls give you something to look at from time-to-time. It's comfortable and a great place to meet friends or groups.   I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"After visiting several brewpubs around Madison, I didn't have my hopes up...but I was pleasantly surprised with Vintage. First off, very welcoming environment with nice seating and fairly quiet. The service was great as my waitress was very attentive but not overly so. The food was very tasty although the fries could have used a tad bit if seasoning. The beers were tasty and I enjoyed the majority of the ones I've tried. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"It is a such a fun bar and restaurant to visit and there are some good brews to sample as well.  The vibe is has a traditional Wisconsin vibe but with a more modern, updated twist.  I've been there with medium and larger groups and the service has been good each time and the food is consistent and solid.   I did a to-go order on my last visit and it didn't take too long to get the items which was good since I had two wiggly children waiting with me.  They kid food menu has a good number of items and there are some fun options for the adults as well--homestyle food with a twist or fun update.  I was also impressed by the XL can of their house-made root beer.  The perfect size or 3-4 people to share.  There was a item that was added to the order that was forgotten but wasn't essential to the meal and the service was kind and efficient and the fact that the kids were happy made me less annoyed about the missing item."}
{"text":"Having a late weekday lunch at VBC yesterday was a real treat. Looking for an alternative to The Olive Garden to take my wife's grandfather to, I opted for VBC based on what I read here on Yelp. First I must say how impressed I was with the \"vintage\" decor. The lighting, chairs and tables as well as lots of black leather couches and seating gave the place a cool vibe. There was a roaring fire in the fireplace which gave it a cozy feeling on a dreary cold day. The menu is extensive with soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta and full entrees. I had the Ravioli with Andouille and chicken. It was quite nice. I washed it down with a VBC Weiss beer which was good---not great. My wife had the chicken pot pie that was REALLY GOOD. She had the Belgian style Wit beer. While I'm not a huge fan of this type of beer, this was one of the best I'd ever tasted. Service was friendly and attentive. Nice to have a new place on our list, next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, the beers are great, And the ladies are sophisticated. This is my favorite place to sit outside and enjoy a drink and music. Idaho nachos, the regular nachos, and the pork belly bites are all amazing. The fish fry is fantastic and the burgers are all great!!"}
{"text":"Very good beer.   Their happy hour is a good deal - I had no idea what I was spending at the time, I was just ordering what I wanted.  When I cashed out, I was pleasantly surprised with the bill.  The oatmeal stout was so good!  I couldn't get myself to order something else.  A few friends passed their selections around to sample and I have to say all the beers I tasted were on the mark.    All the food looked really good - I didn't get a chance to eat much, but it's safe to say they aren't digging stuff out the freezer for you - it's pretty crafty and tasty.  I was pleased with the service.  Everyone was friendly and service was quick even as business ramped up through happy hour.  Vintage Brewing is in a great location for the west side - ideal for happy hours, lunch or dinner.  I'll have to schedule a \"lunch with mom\" and update my review with food input."}
{"text":"Vintage is a great go-to place for dinner and drinks. I recently went for a friend's birthday on a Sunday night. Plenty of tables available for our large group.   Great house-brewed beers, and a large selection for a microbrewery. The food is great, awesome burgers, tater tots!, and the pizzas on their late night menu are tasty."}
{"text":"I found this place to be less than inviting.  I've visited many brewpubs around the country, and they're generally happy to have you try their beers.  Vintage charges for tastes.  Not just 4oz sample glasses, but tastes.  Some they won't let you try at all without buying at least a 4 oz glass for $3.  I usually like to try a taste before buying an unfamiliar pint.  I can't remember ever being refused a simple taste.  I spoke to the manager and he reiterated that they couldn't let me try the beer without paying for it.  What a terrible policy for a brewpub.  On the positive side, our sandwiches were pretty good.  The burger was done correctly as well.  The sides were nothing to brag about though.  Their fries were supposed to be great, but they were just basic french fries with little flavor.  By the way, they charged us one dollar each for tiny sides of barbecue sauce - without informing us that there would be a cost.  It looks like management is obsessed with nickel and diming customers to squeeze out more profit.  I love brewpubs, but I won't be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Vintage is a solid 3.5 stars, I'm generously rounding up because the Asian pork belly bites are my favorite thing and I recently tried the rip rip mac & Cheese which was... ridiculous in the best way.  I generally get take out when I'm staying nearby and I can reliably count on my order being wrong every time. Also, they seem to nickel & dime you for every little thing. Example: I ordered their poutine a couple of times when they used to offer an upgrade with pork & a fried egg. The pork was overwhelming, so I once ordered it just with the egg and was charged the full upcharge despite getting none of the meat. They also once got confused & charged me for the sauce on my rip rip chicken and on top of it gave me the wrong sauce.   But, if you dine in there's a nice patio. This place is always ridiculously busy too. I'm not sure it's worth waiting for, but do grab some of those Asian pork belly bites if you can."}
{"text":"We've been to Vintage Brewing Co several times for both lunch and dinner.  Went again the other night with friends and had yet another good meal and good service.  Perhaps our favorite thing about VBC is the decor- we love the comfortable retro feel of the place.  This time most of us had burgers and sandwiches (based on the other reviews we've seen on here, all of us avoided the ravioli).  I had the Home Grown burger, which I've had before, and it was really good- cooked just right, not super messy to eat, and the apple slice gives it a really nice crunch.  I had tater tots as a side and as usual, they were great- it's so easy for tots to be soggy, but these were nice and crispy and perfect. The husband had the Little Pig Little Pig Little Pig sandwich, which he really liked, and the curly fries, which were tasty but I thought the tots were better. Our dining companions all enjoyed their meals as well.  We all had various beers (Sister Golden Ale, Woodshed IPA, Toy Boat, and the Oatmeal Stout) and everyone seemed happy with their choice.  I had the Woodshed IPA and thought it was a pretty basic, run of the mill IPA.  Nothing that really stood out about it, but it was good and was a nice complement to my meal."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. I've been here for dinner with friends, drinks after a meeting and even sporting events and have never been disappointed. The menu is great, the beer is awesome and you can't beat their outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Inventive Menu.  Warm inviting space.  Good brews and spirts.  Perfect for after work gatherings or pre-game dinner.  Have been there a few times and I know I will be back."}
{"text":"The staff can be hit or miss but the Vintage is killing it right now with their menu.  We go there often.  Not sure what back-of-house adjustments they made but they're working.  Front-of-house can be a bit cliquey and catty, but it's still worth it for the food.  Menu changes seasonally."}
{"text":"Great beer, great menu.  They have a selection of homemade sauces. Absolutely love that touch.   Service is great.  With all the micro brews in Madison I'd say this is most underrated."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good. My server was attentive, and got my orders correct.  The food was... Not great. I had a BYOB cheese burger, and it was super dry and not very tasty. My companions did not rate their food highly either. Everything was dry and bland. There are better places to eat in Madison. Drinks were good though! So maybe stop in for a drink, but go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"I come for the bartenders, cheese curds with homemade ranch, and their fantabulous Bombay Sapphire and tonics!  I can't say enough things about the quality service and food here."}
{"text":"The Vintage has been our go to restaurant when we are on the west side shopping, or meeting up with friends or family members. I've been here only for dinner at various times over the last few years. It's in a convenient spot and the menu is pretty varied - there's a little something on there for everyone. I would say we are here at a minimum of 3 times a year if not more.  It is a great casual spot when you have no idea where to go or what your guests may be interested in eating. I also went on a date here with my fiancee when we had just started dating, so it's safe to say this could also be a casual date location.  They have interesting decor (vintage/retro obviously), a huge bar area and plenty of seating. Vintage has their own beers so you definitely want to try a glass or two. I've had anything from the Sister Golden Ale to the McLovin. They offer many seasonal brews/drinks, so the menu is always different. For their menu, I typically stick with wraps, burgers, etc. What I can recommend is always order the tater tots as a side!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.  Good beer!  I had the fish tacos, which were tasty.  Perfect crunchy texture to the batter!  Just enough spice, but not overwhelming.  I had a bite of the meatloaf sandwich which was also tasty.  Big portions, neither of is finished our lunch."}
{"text":"I love to come here on Thursday for 1/2 off Vintage brews and $1 rail drinks. Laid back atmosphere, good beer, and yummy cheese curds. The outdoor patio in the summer is a great place to sit, chat, and people watch"}
{"text":"So glad there's some good food to spruce up the heavily trafficked Whitney Way area.  The atmosphere: Bar, booth, and table seating. There is a small party room if you have a large group.  TVs are located around the restaurant, although there are some areas with fewer TVs if you don't feel like watching sports.  The beer:  Rotating menu of their beers berwed on-site, along with detailed descriptions and plenty of guest beers to choose from  The food: Mostly American food; a wide variety of appetizers, sandwiches, and burgers, along with some full entree items and BBQ selections.  Also daily specials.  The Home Grown burger is my favorite; local beef patty with thin apple slices, arugula, cheddar, and vinegar reduction.  Sometimes you get crazy specials too, like pheasant casserole (good!)  Sports watching:  The Great Dane is somewhat comprable, however, the Dane is crazy if you don't get there early.  On the other hand, you will be surrounded by other WI sports fans if you go to the Vintage, but you can actually get a seat!  During the rose bowl, they had free apple pie shots.   The food here is a reliably good. Take a break here before getting on the Beltline or on a game day."}
{"text":"It would definitely be a 5star for their beer. They change the menu seasonally(?) but there are always lots of options, also feel free to ask for recommendation or advise, the people are also very good at helping you decide.  Nothing special about the food, but overall is a nice place to hangout with friends and watch a game :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always amazing & the drinks delicious. The staff are great as well. This time, I tried the grilled meatball burger & it was ridiculously wonderful. It's made with Italian sausage, short ribs, & some other magic. Topped with cheese, marinara sauce, & pesto sauce. Do yourself a favor & try it."}
{"text":"The food is fine. We had tasty nachos and a perfectly decent burger. But I have to say, the service is terrible. The server actually dropped my burger while on her way to deliver it, did not apologize but simply commented that it was the first time she had dropped one. She picked up the burger,  but left the onion, etc. on the floor throughout the rest of our evening. I ate my side dish and, when it arrived, my burger, while my companion tried to slow down his consumption so he didn't finish before I started.  All around, a weird dinner. I would give the place three stars for food, but if I could give them two for service, I would."}
{"text":"FOUR WORDS: ASIAN PORK BELLY BITES. If you go here, and you don't order this, you've already made a mistake. Even if these don't sound appetizing to you, which it should, STILL ORDER IT. Order it for your table, and be the talk of the ages. Show off your prowess and adventurous side. Besides this, you can never go wrong with the BBQ Baked Mac n' Cheese. It is topped with a perfect crust of bread crumbs. Filled with cheese throughout the dish. AND AT THE BOTTOM: Some juicy BBQ pulled pork, which was an amazing surprise. Pro-Tip: Check the beginning of this post, AND BUY MORE PORK BELLY BITES!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 2 Star only because the waitress has been great. Other than that my experience here has been awful. I know people usually come to a place like this and pay more attention to the \"adult\" beverages but I'm here with my kids, so I chose a pepsi to drink. All of the sodas come from a gun, so be prepared for them to be watered down. Unfortunately, there is no other option (can, bottle, etc). The wait for our food was ok but several others than came after us got their food before we did. When our food arrived it looked good but the \"fries\" (which are semi curled potato wedges) are gross. The smell that's coming from them is a nauseating mixture of old grease and tortillas. The taste isn't any better. My husband gives his Stroganoff a \"meh\" and the beer he tried is sub par, leaving a gross after taste. The kids like the build your own burger, which is huge for a kids meal but are grossed out by the tortilla grease riddled potato wedges. All in all a terrible experience, spending way too much money for something I can tell the cooks or better yet management, didn't give 2 craps about."}
{"text":"Our of this world phenomenal! Lived every bite. The hoof wings were a treat, the cheese curds delicate and awesome; the bbq Mac & cheese blew me away. It is a bed of pulled pork covered with Mac & cheese. House made root beer and cream soda were killer.  One of my favorite must-hit places in Wisconsin"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the first time for a couple of post-work beers, and enjoyed it.  I had their oatmeal stout (very good), and their pale ale (fizzy and pretty forgettable, but fine).  We sat at the bar, and the service was attentive.  Our food was solid and arrived within a reasonable time.  It happened to be team trivia night, so my companion and I hung around for that - it may have affected the crowd's demographics a bit, but I thought there was a pretty good mix of people here.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the location (stand alone building near strip mall) but the beer is top notch.  Great job last fall on the Rye IPA and this past weekend enjoyed thir IPA and a coffee infused brew.    Have not tried the food but I do recommend buying a growler of their beer."}
{"text":"What a pleasurable experience!!! Loved the beer, had the abbey double dedication, so full of flavor and just right up my alley. Also tried a non local bilbo baggins which was appealing. Their pork belly appetizer was huge for the nominal price tag, it was a little heavy for me , so I decided to take the rest home for later. It was a little luke  warm, but still delicious, also enjoyed the wedge salad which might be the best wedge I have ever had. The pickled tomatoes were like candy and the bacon lardons were perfectly crispy!! Great size and value, was dismayed to learn I had been charged $1 for extra dressing, but it was still worth the price tag. Service was also exceptional and I can't wait to come back and try many of their sandwiches and entrees!"}
{"text":"A good late lunch early dinner at a place we stumbled upon. We were driving through and had to stop at Big Lots (bc it's my husband's fav bargain store that's not really open in Chicago anymore so we stop at any one we see) and then we got hungry and this place was across the parking lot.  It's much nicer on the inside than the non descript exterior would have you believe. And while it's got a brewery and vintage styling going on, it's still got that big suburb restaurant vibe than a local quaint town or hipster city vibe. Not that that's a bad thing, it does it's job it's just not as memorable a place for me because of this.  We sat next to the fireplace which was lovely on a cold day and the food was good, nothing too crazy or memorable just good solid food.  Friendly service, good gluten free options as well."}
{"text":"I have considered this my favorite restaurant in Madison for some time now, so I better get around to writing a review.  It saved me again today when everywhere else I tried to go had a 45 minute wait.  Decided to just go to Vintage again and there was hardly anyone there - their loss!  They have pretty good beer.  Sometimes hit or miss.  I always start with a few tastings, which are reasonably priced, and go from there to pick something out.  They will fill a growler for you if you find something you really like.  As good as the beer is it is outshined by how great the food is!  Some standouts are the pork belly bites or the breakfast style corn dogs for apps, and the chicken and waffles, 50/50 burger, and mac and cheese (spicy, and so freaking good the next day).  Nothing I have tried has been boring.  Sit outside if you can, they have a nice patio.  The inside is sometimes too dimly lit for my taste and the music can be a drag, but nothing that keeps me away."}
{"text":"Still waiting for our food. It has now been 25 minutes. For a medium rare burger, a side salad and a cup of soup. Really?  There are open tables - not like they're super busy. Our server is not the best at his job.  We'll choose somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Still a 3, my husband got the High on the Hog burger that was insanely spicy but did not have the indication of being spicy like other dishes had with a pepper symbol. The description does mention hot peppers but it should definitely have a spicy sign by it like the other spicy menu items. My husband could not finish it and did not feel good afterwards.  We really enjoy their pork belly bits and their burgers, sans the high in the hog, are pretty top notch. Mine is always cooked well, medium rare and it's a nice portion of local beef. I also enjoy the stroganoff with steak. I had the Black and Blu burger tonight with tater tots but they really need to change their fry oil more often. Several times now their fries have tasted like their fish fry and tonight my tater tots tasted like tortilla chips. It's kinda gross if you think about it, not sure how old that oil is for the flavor to permeate other fried foods. Will probably pay the extra 2.50 for a side salad next time to avoid this problem.  Service is still eh and awkward. We've been getting it to go lately and I like that better. This place could easily be a 4 stars for me but I can't get past the service, atmosphere, and the old fry oil."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to review the Vintage many times over the years but its taken me a while because I'm never quite sure if I want to give them 3 or 4 stars.  That struggle probably reflects my true opinion of them as somewhere in the middle, but due to a few recent positive experiences they're getting the 4th star today.  The low down-  Burger-Bar Restaurant with a classy but casual vibe in an area of town that desperately needs some life.  In the location of many failed establishments before it, this Vintage actually beat the odds and has been around for quite sometime (ignoring their downtown spot).  I think a huge part of that is the fun atmosphere they've created with a solid selection of beers, menu items, and lounge style interior.  And like my visit today included, their always excellent patio.  They have a vibe that is much more inviting as a post-work or night-out beer spot than their predecessors, and that's why they keep things hopping late into the evening.  The beers are heavy but tasty, and while I'd rattle some of my faves off to you, everyone's palette is different so just try some and you'll eventually hit the mark (or at least be in a happy place soon enough).  I'd say they're above average for most of the brewery/restaurant combos in Madison, and there's enough selection to keep you interested.  Cheese Curds are delicious here, and Burgers are their forte.  I'd argue they have one of the better burgers in town, not quite Dotty's level but impressive nevertheless on the presentation scale and sourcing of ingredients.  You get your money's worth ($8-15), and the accompanying fries are both unique and full of starchy goodness.  It's also great that there's a smattering of choices even within the burger selection, most of them oriented around different ethnic backgrounds (Japanese, Italian, Mexican, etc).  Still on the food side, their late night menu after 10 includes shareable pizzas for $12 and appetizers for $5.  You won't leave hungry.  Service has always been the questionable side for me, I've had nights where the bartenders/servers were friendly and conversational, and others not so much.  The last few times have improved though, and I've seen enough of the same commentary in reviews here, so I'm of the belief that they're trying to make strides on this.  And with the wonderful outdoor patio that they have, it's the perfect time to do so.  Sit outside on a nice summer day, treat yourself to that albatross burger you oh-so-love, and soak in the goodness of Wisconsin.  Life's too short to not have some good beer and beef every once in a while"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!! We had a long wait due to short hand staff, but the food was amazing!! The burgers are so good and there are a ton of sauces for your fries! Start with the pretzels for an appetizer too!"}
{"text":"Always a great time at this brewery.  The food is wonderful, the staff friendly, and the beer...AMAZING!  I can't brag enough about the selection of beer that they serve.  There is a wide selection on draft they brew themselves with wonderful selection of food.  It's the place to be whether with friends, family, or yourself.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I love the Vintage and come here a lot. I would recommend it to others, but it feels like more of a 3.5 star kind of place lately.    The atmosphere is cool. The restaurant is very large and can accommodate groups well.  The bar area has plenty of TVs. They have a great happy hour. The service has always been timely and pleasant.  Some of my favorite dishes are the pot roast balls and the stroganoff. My husband's favorites are the pastrami a-go-go and the burgers. The fries are really good. An amazing appetizer I can't get enough of is the chips with beer cheese dip.   So why 3.5 stars? INCONSISTENCY.  I've had many good experiences, but I've also had experiences where I've been disappointed with my favorite dishes. For example, I raved about the pot roast balls and my dad ordered them and got a plate that looked like 2 good pot roast balls and one weird misshapen half of a pot roast ball. On another occasion, I talked up the beer cheese dip, and my friends and I were disappointed when our dip was served at a luke warm temperature. On my most recent visit, I had the pumpkin ravioli which had a delicious filling and an amazing sauce, but the actual ravioli was very thick and dense and chewy.    I expect better from you Vintage! I'll keep coming back, but they need to work on serving a consistent product, so I can stop wondering if I'll get an awesome meal or be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this place! But the salmon sandwich that I had there last week deserves a review of its own! This was the best salmon sandwich I've had. Perfect combination of ingredients: pan seared salmon, arugula, pickled onion, bacon and a delicious sauce. It is even kind of annoying how much I liked it because later that evening I was thinking about getting this again next time I go back and I was also thinking about going back there like the next day!"}

{"text":"Had dinner at the Vintage last night and enjoyed it very much. We started off with the House Smoked Salmon Dip. It was delicious, if a bit pricey.  I had the Blue Heaven burger,  and my companions had: the All American burger, the Hold the Meat Burger, and the Fish & Chips. Everyone was pleased with their food, and Mr. Fish & Chips declared it was the best fried fish he'd had in a loooooong time.  The decor is fun, without being twee. Service was good.   All in all, I'd say this is a very nice, and much needed addition to the West Gate area."}
{"text":"One of the best comfort food destinations in Madison.  And there are too many comfort food places.   The beers are excellent.  The burgers are the best in Madison.  I repeat,  the burgers are the best in Madison.  The Nachos always rock.  I have found myself seriously disappointed that favorites drop from the menu.   The Tiger burger,  though wrong by nature,  was consistently the best burger I have ever eaten.  I almost left out of anger the day it wasn't on the menu.  Also loss of the stroganoff was a sad day.    Dear chef:  we would be back at least 3 more times/ year if the tiger returned."}
{"text":"We were staying in Middleton, it was a rainy night, and wanted a good, close place to watch the SF Giants playoff game. Off to Vintage Brewing Co. we went.   Upon arrival around 6pm on a Tuesday night, there was no wait at all. We ordered the pretzel appetizer that came with cheese-beer dip and mustard-beer dip. The pretzel wasn't that great, it was doughy and chewy. The cheese-beer dipping sauce was better than the mustard one.  I got the Home Grown Burger cooked medium which was just the right away of pinkness. The burger was sooo juicy. Slices of apple in a burger? Weird, I know. But the flavors complimented well with the slice of apple. It was a delicious burger. I would probably opt for the potato chips instead of tater tots had I know that potato chips weren't the Lays one but home made!  Overall a solid place for a burger! I'm looking forward to trying The Old Fashioned and comparing the two burgers :)"}
