{"text":"This is, I  believe ,  my third time coming  her√® .  I have  ordered  their wings ,  catfish ,  and  polish boy. Let me start with the positive  :  so far, the chicken  has been  consistent with  always  being  perfectly  cooked . ..golden brown with a nice crunch. The polish boy had a nice flavor ,  the cole slaw was good, and the catfish  was okay. The young lady at the counter was very pleasant .   Now the  negative: I  don't  know  how  they  cook/heat the polish  sausage ,  but it was  almost  dried out like leather .  The fries are so so. The catfish could  have been  fried a little  harder, but not a big  deal - I  don't  think it was  cooked  -to-order. But lastly ,  the main  reason  I  come here  is for the wings, and they  are consistently  TOO SALTY !  The breading  that  they  use for chicken  and fish  needs less salt!  It is for  this  reason  that  I  may  not return  anytime  soon, if ever. Very disappointing  when this is the  only  thing that will keep me away . ..other than the overly salty  breading, it   has  a delicious  flavor .  Maybe I  will  give  another try in a few months. Oh, I  definitely  will  never  order  the sliced 7-up pound cake again--it was cut so thin  for $3+ a slice, and was  not that great. I hope  the manager reads this post  and see the need to cut back  on salt."}
{"text":"Drive by everyday for work. I like to support local business so I thought I'd give it a try. Walked in, one customer was waiting. Young woman was by the fryer breading and putting items in the fryer. She said hello and continued to work. Only other person I saw was a repairman working on a fryer on the left. Waited at least 5 minutes before she came over and took my order, asked how long it would take for Challenger and she said 4 minutes. Placed my order and waited and waited, 12 minutes. Fish was very strong and mushy. No crunch at all. Some of the lettuce was brown. Put 2 packets of hot sauce on sandwich and couldn't taste it. I tasted directly from packet and nothing, no spice, no heat. Fries were barely cooked and plain frozen ones. Nothing impressive here. I'll spend my money somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"I ordered the challenger and trust me it was a challenge to it. Is was so nasty. My stomach hurt for 24 hrs. I see the potential. However I felt that the sandwich could have been made with more care and fresher tomatoes. It was later in the evening and they where busy. But still my experience was not good."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I wasn't optimistic but I'm so glad I ordered! We had an orange roughy dinner, whiting sandwich and chicken & waffles. Everything was really good including the fries and cole slaw! The customer service was great, it was crowded and I watched them prepare and package my food. Everything was separated just the way I like it and the proportions were big!  Suggestions: the waffle was a little soggy but still tasty; maybe put holes in the container. Don't place all the cold items on the sandwich for the same reason. The chicken was also delicious, just a little saltier than I would've liked.  Everything was wonderful nonetheless. I'm happy we went and we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty decent but I would not return to a place that heats up food in a microwave. I mean they didn't even bother to hide it, it's directly behind the counter, clearly visible to everybody. I only saw about 3 orders of green beans go in there. The staff looked overworked and worn out. I won't waste my time coming back."}
{"text":"Wait time is extremely long.i ordered 2 peices of perch and 4 peices shrimp. Taste was ok but very greasy. Fries were soggy no salt  The roll had a funny odor couldnt eat it.not to good but its soul junk"}
{"text":"So, this was only my second time going there and my last time as well. Was told they were out of an item (which was the main reason I was there) cashier told me not to cut my eyes at her in very nasty tone. Caught me completely off guard. I asked her what was she talking about...She replies: you cut your eyes at me because I told you we were out of that item. I explained to her that I was not, and that I had to rethink my order. Needless to say she went on, but tried to clean it up in the end. Customer service is everything to me...And today it was terrible. THIS IS WHY I DO NOT PATRONIZE BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES! CHECK THE ATTITUDES!!!"}
{"text":"Their waffle is the best I have tasted. I'm not sure what the secret ingredients are, but they combine to make a cloud like pastry that combines with the chicken to fill you up and leave a big smile on your face. The staff is friendly and helpful and take the time to explain menu options."}
{"text":"The floors are sticky and service is ridiculously slow. Polish boys and chicken were both subpar."}
{"text":"I noticed that Sam Sylks opened a second location on Mayfield in South Euclid so I figured I would give it a try.  Located in a free standing building with a small parking lot that used to house a Mr. Hero.  When you walk in there is the order counter with the kitchen behind.  The menu is a variety of chicken and fish along with sides.  Since it was a Tuesday, I figured I would get the Challenge sandwich special which is 2 large fillets of Whiting on a bun with lettuce, tomato, tarter sauce and a side of fries.  The portion size was generous, with the Whiting a bit strong in flavor, but with a crispy coating.  The bun was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of fish so I ended up taking it apart to eat.  The fries were very ordinary frozen french fries, nothing memorable at all.  They were unable to provide me with  a cup of water, but offered to sell me a bottle of water.  I was hoping that Sylks would provide a nice alternative to get some affordable fish nearby, while not horrible I was underwhelmed by the food.  Hopefully they will improve as they move forward."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is not that tasty. It's a bit on the bland side. I ordered fried shrimp that tasted very frozen and bland, it was quite mediocre. The french fries were dry and tasteless but the perch fish was ok. It's not enough to go back and try anything else."}
{"text":"I keep trying this place even though I say I won't be back. I returned after they wanted to charge me an extra .50 for seasoning even though I had never been charged before. I returned after they either didn't answer the phones or had me on hold for over 5 minutes and was already in the place. But why does it take over 25 minutes just to get an order of fries??? My arteries are better off without."}
{"text":"If your hungry don't come here. The service is very slow I called my order in and they told me 15 minutes over the phone. When I got here I waited another 30 minutes. It wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Went in there today for the first AND last time. I decided to eat in, not take out. They were not busy with other customers, I was the only person there. They were cooking take out orders. During my entire visit they did not engage me in any conversation. The cook walked in front of me at least 5 times, did not acknowledge me at any time. The counter girl did not say anything to me outside of taking my order. When I left, they both completely ignored me even though I was the only one there and saw me get up, walk to the door and walk out. I will not patronize any business that does not even understand common courtesy or make any effort to be appreciative or decent.  South Euclid Location."}
{"text":"Stopped by to support a local business and a great DJ. He's always done so much the community, but he could have kept this idea though. Both my husband and I got the Challenge sandwich and fries. His whiting had bones in it and it was under seasoned, but crispy. The bun was a plain hot dog bun. When we picked up our food we asked for hot sauce, the hound lady at the counter politley told us it was in the bag. My fault for not checking, because when we got back to our office, all we had was ketchup.   The decor is very minimal, but the prices were decent. There are more flavorful alternatives just around the corner. IF I go again, I'll try the chicken."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place on 3 occasions. The first time the food was good, not great, but good. The next time the fish was so greasy and over cooked it was so hard I had to throw all of it away because you couldn't eat it. The fries got thrown away too because they were grease soaked and very heavy. I didn't call them or anything I just left it alone. I, like an idiot, went back today and low and behold, my experience was worse than awful again. They upsell but the food portion is not in proportion with the upsell pricing. I called this time and requested a manager and was flat out refused by Trish. I ended up 'having to' talk to her who yelled at me and never offered an apology she only said \"well if you don't like it just bring it back and get your money\". Of course I am not going back .... EVER! I have also sent picture messages to my friends and family and shared my experience with them. They will support me and glad spend our monies elsewhere. I will be sharing this with more of them as soon as I speak with them, especially the ones who live close and tend to get a little lazy and want fast food. There was no reciprocity. Sam Sylk's just lost a few of us."}
