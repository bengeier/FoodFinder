{"text":"If you're looking for homecooking in the Kannapolis/Concord area, this is your spot!  I was quite pleased with my sampling of turkey wings, fried chicken, green beans, collards, rice and gravy, and mac n cheese.  The cornbread was average, but the yeast roll was pretty good.  Overall, they were pretty solid and should do good business in the area."}
{"text":"Moved to the area in Nov. 2012, and pass by this place all the time.  Finnaly stopped in and gave it a shot.  Took it easy and tried the chicken fried steak, collards, and fried okra.  The take out box was filled nicely.  Damage was just over 8 bucks and definitely got my monies worth.  Seating area was empty except for one guy.  Looks to be more take out then anything.  
The collards were seasoned good, not overpowering.  The rest of the food was as expected from a fryer.  I'll repeat here and get a bit more adventurous.  I would definitely say it is worth a chance."}
{"text":"I thought that this would kill it but... What it did do was to kill a bottle of Pepto. I can tell you that I and my wife prayed to the toilet GOD. It looked great but, the sour smell of the oxe tail should have told me something.Now I know why there was no one in this place and they are not open on the week-end. 
                    Great idea if you could make it happen...I would have given them a extra star but, when you cook canned green beans and tell me they are fresh well... that does not have any Soul."}
