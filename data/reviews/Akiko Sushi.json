{"text":"Nice ambience, service and food. Offers both sushi and japanese style hot dishes. Reasonable price for lunch specials ($9+) and all-you-can-eat buffet ($16 at lunch, $24 for dinner, weekend nights are $27)."}
{"text":"The sushi pizza was okay, but all three rolls tasted like cucumber and rice...bland.  Expensive for such quality and small portions."}
{"text":"The restaurant is sooooo good! From the entree to the meal! The salad is a must eat! also the dragon eye's is delicious"}
{"text":"Love this place! Now there are new owners and they changed up the menu a lil bit... Which is too bad because they removed my favourite rolls from the all you can eat menu such as; spider and Gucci. However, I still very much enjoyed myself and it will beats places like kanda and sushi \"st Jean, crescent, st Catherine\". The oriental dishes are very good aswell! Nice scenery located upstairs overlooking Côte des neiges."}
{"text":"This sushi place is either a buffet or you can order à la carte. I went for the buffet and I did have a good time but I do have pros and cons list.  Pros: Excellent service Good menu selection Cute restaurant Fresh avocado  Cons: Stingy on the cheese Small sushi size (but if you get the buffet it doesn't matter) They were all made in the restaurant as we ordered them but they didn't all taste fresh  The restaurant has no air conditioning so it feels so stuffy as you walk in"}
{"text":"J'ai commandé par téléphone, je n'ai donc aucune idée du service sur place. Je me soupçonne une intolérance au saumon, je demande donc un combo au choix du chef, mais sans saumon. On m'annonce que c'est la première fois qu'une telle commande est faite. Je me sens unique (et mal à l'aise).  Prix abordable, mais rien d'exceptionnel côté goût. Je trouve l'ensemble de l'oeuvre assez sèche. Livraison en 45 minutes en milieu d'après-midi. C'était ok pour satisfaire une envie intense de sushi, mais si je commande chez Akiko à nouveau, ce sera en salle, pour admirer le portrait entier."}
{"text":"Wow... Very nice unexpected surprise.  An awesome little sushi place!  They take great care to make a very pretty plate. It's a nice quiet pretty little quaint spot up above the city corner.  The waiter was very attentive and the food I had was most enjoyable.  My guests were all happy with their meals. We may come back soon to try the all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi if you're not opting for an all you can eat gluttony fest at Kanda's.   Came here today to order to-go and went a little crazy at first. It came out to 62$ for two people and we decided to instead go for the \"chef's special\" which was 20 pieces for 18$. On top of that we ordered tempura and tofu. The tofu was really bad and I'd never order it again. The tempura was delicate and great but a very small portion.  The sushi was phenomenal! Can't really tell you what was all in there but it was just great. Every piece was made with care and bursting with flavour.   While I'm living in Cote des Neiges i'll be coming here for sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!  The only good bring your own wine I found in Montreal.  I used to get delivery nearly 3 times a week and I moved to Miami.. I miss their tartare rolled in rice paper and lettuce.. I think it's called Gucci .. I can't find anything similar to it anywhere. I miss this place.. I for sure am going to stop by during my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Just had some amazing sushis from this place.. we had the chefs special with 20 pieces and some tokyo ones..  loved everything from the environment, the staff to the food. And was really delighted by the low sodium soy sauce. Highly recommended :)"}
