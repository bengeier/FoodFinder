{"text":"4th time coming here and its still closed. Never open when it says it would be and never open any other day, I give up. I'm convinced it's a wrap for this place. Hungry Island died of starvation"}
{"text":"Everytime me and my family come to get food, WE NEVER LEAVE DISAPPOINTED. The various food choices are as FRESH as they come. I've seen them at the Rugby 7's and Pure Aloha and never miss a chance to get my samoan food fix. Me and my family will continue to support our only Samoan eatery for many years to come!!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another review about how impossible it is to come here because they don't keep their own hours. I understand  \"island time\" but not even being open on your designated days is pretty sad.  I've come by on weekday afternoons, weekend lunch time, and shortly before close- no one is ever here.   Neighboring businesses have received my patronage instead and have said they're not sure this place is even open. Their social media pages make  more  mention of their pop-up booths at events and plate sales rather than their actual store. What a joke."}
{"text":"I've never been in here but my review is about the fact that I went there and the doors were locked when the hours shown on their door should have been open.  I tried calling this business to see what was going on and no answer.    I've asked other people in the surrounding business to see if they new what was up with this place and they've also said they've encountered the place being locked when they should have been open.    Anyone know the deal with this place?  I really wanted to see what this place had to offer."}
{"text":"BEST Samoan food in all of Las Vegas! Its delicious and homemade! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Talofa! We appreciate the fact that this place sells items that we can all appreciate. However the advertised open hours were not honored. I hope to see a business that can stick to their advertised open hours---it will certainly help with your credibility. Thanks."}
{"text":"We were excited to find this place. The Samoan food was amazing, according to my husband.  I loved all of the leis, t-shirts and islander jewelry.  The owner was very kind and gracious. :-) Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have been here on 4 different occasions and each time it was closed, when the posted hours said it was supposed to be open....I won't be going for a 5th time....fooled me one too many times!"}
{"text":"It's a good place if they kept to their opening times. We've been there since 10-1033 n still not open. People are in there but no one answers the phone...smh"}
{"text":"I recall this place being some sort of Tongan and Samoan market a few years back.  Uncle that was serving me claims that the owners have switched several times until it became the Hungry Islander.    Inside you will find that the mom and pop Polynesian store specializes in anything from crafts, memorabilia, collectibles, canned islands foods, frozen turkey tails, lamp chop necks, as well as other island favorites (Manapua, Zippy's chili, Portugese Sausage, S&S Saimin, Shumai, etc.).  As usual, Polynesian hospitality was in full effect and although ran on a skeleton crew of two when I was there, there was no shortage of courtesy what so ever.  Also, remember that because I am from the islands, I ain't scared to tell it how it is, so no bias perspectives here, uh thank you.  You will trip out wondering where the food is at first, but you will find that there is a buffet bar towards the rear of the establishment, serving up daily made hot and fresh Sapasui, Palm corned beef and cabbage, Faiaai Pilikaki and Samoan Sausage.  The dishes are served with rice or taro and comes in 1,2 and 3 entree plate lunches.  The only thing is that the cheapest starts at $10.99 and the grinds are take out only.  Its hard to go wrong with corned beef and cabbage, the sausage could use a little more seasoning or at least a dipping sauce, but was very tender to say the least.  The Faiaai Pilikaki (Mackerel and Mayo Mix) was ohhh so good, but probably not the best in terms of calories.  I had my dish with taro and didn't complain about the serving portions.  After all, Samoa's number 1 export ain't coconuts or green bananas...it's NFL athletes.  I will most likely be back to by some goods for the house.  The pricey plate lunches may reserve my cravings to maybe once every month or so.  Still, Polynesian food is a not as easy to come by unlike its Hawaiian cousins.  I already know all the true sole's must know about this place, now that they have been here for over a year this April.   If you like Samoan food, and because it is somewhat of a specialty due to its scacity, I would have rated this place a 3.5-3.75, rounding it to a nice 4 star experience.  Not bad at all.  Cheeee Hooooooo!"}
