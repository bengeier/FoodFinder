{"text":"Great food and wonderful service!!!! The manager is really friendly too! I would definitely recommend the steak quesadillas and the margaritas. I love the feel of the restaurant and that they are renovating the front entry. I can't wait to see it completed. Thanks for making this meal and experience!!!"}
{"text":"I had the fajita combo and found it to be better than I was expecting.  The ingredients were fresh and hot off the grill.  Our first waitress was great! We had a 2 year old with us and he was being kinda fussy so without asking she brought him some things to color.  Then her shift must have ended because it seemed like we were forgotten about with our drinks not being refilled and the check taking forever so when you go don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for the flautas alone.  They come with this mango-flavored sauce that is outstanding!  Most Mexican places give you chips and salsa while you order--they have got to have the best chips of any in this area.  They are usually warm, salted, and crispy-thin.  The kid's menu is terrific, too.  The kids get a very healthy portion of food plus an added ice cream sundae--and it's cheap!  The best price and food for kids.  
Two downsides I can think of:  1) The margaritas are weak, and 2) You will smell like a tex-mex kitchen after you leave--I mean your coat, hair, everything."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible and that is the nicest words I can use. Arrived for lunch and we ordered al a carte burritos. First issue, it took over an hour and 20 min to even receive our food. Then second issue, we cut into or burritos and they are ice cold as though they took the beans, cheese, and steak rifht out of a bag and rolled it into the tortilla. After bringing this to the attention of our waiter he just takes the plates and walks away. Then, we are given our bills which charged over 13 dollars for an al a carte burrito. Wth?? So we ask for a Manger as the manager approaches we are scolded by him and basically made out to be cheap skates in front of everyone and are told we are ignorant of we think cheese should always be melted.

Absolutely horrible. Horrible food, horrible manager, and way way over priced do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Terrific Margaritas and you have to ask for Antonio! Best Server! He knows the menu, checks I with you regularly and can change up any menu item to be exactly what you want. Vinnie is a great Bartender and pours up some spectacular concoctions from the drink menu. We'll definitely be  back. Great food and great evening!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. Only thing is they are kinda expensive. The waitress was nice and attentive. I also like that they make fresh tortillas to order for the fajitas. But here's where it sucked. I paid and  I wanted to box my food and take my leftovers home. I asked for another side of pico de gallo and she said I would have to pay for it. Are you serious! It's a tiny cup like for dipping sauce. I agreed to pay the 1 dollar. At least she brought it to me and said she wouldn't charge me but next time she would. Probably realized how stupid it is to open another check to charge for it."}
{"text":"Best tacos in vegas area! Their little scoop of sweet corn masa (OR WHATEVER IT IS..LOL) is amazing and addicting. Always great service and never a bad bite."}
{"text":"Fresh...not! Went here years ago when they first opened and was impressed. In the neighborhood and remembered them so decided to try again. Major disappointment. The dish I remember best no longer on menu. Order beef chimi. Yuck! Filled with unseasoned ground beef and covered with what looked like (and tasted worse than\" Cheez-Wiz.."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons to love Chevy's!
Awesome table side guac. It's delish and they will adjust the spiciness and chunkiness to your liking. They do great promos all the time, like buy one combo get one for a penny. Fresh homemade tortillas that you can watch being made! Fruity margaritas! Prickly pear, melon, etc.

I am a very picky eater, and a vegetarian, but they are always willing to make substitution and make things totally fresh to accomodate me. This is one of the few places I will drive 25 minutes to eat at."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just get a hankerin' for some chips and salsa and margaritas.  Chevy's to the rescue!  I love their seasonal flavored margaritas; tonight I had the cranberry margarita... mmmmm!

No, it's not \"authentic Mexican\"... it's fresh mex as specified by the name, so there shouldn't be any surprise that this doesn't taste like your neighborhood Mexican joint.  If you go in knowing what to expect, you'll enjoy your meal.

The thing that really surprises me about this location is how empty it is.  Maybe Chevy's just isn't that popular in Arizona?  Been here twice and both times, we were one of just a few tables.  That's all right; made for good service and fresh food."}
{"text":"We finally made it out to Chevy's after having their chips and salsa at many an event with our friends.  As always, they were pretty good - tasted way more fresh than the chips at El Toro/Dos Reales.  I ordered a steak quesadilla and it was huge and awesome.  I've been craving another one ever since we went!  My husband got something called the Chevy spread?  I dunno, something like that, but it had all kinds of enchiladas and stuff with it and he said it was good - even the corn frittery thing that was on the side.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"The three stars is due to the wait, 20 minutes on a Monday night at 730? I don't think so. And they only had a tiny portion of the restaurant open so there were tables everywhere that couldve been filled. 

Most of the staff, while friendly, made apparent how much they hated their jobs. The manager ran around picking up and cleaning in a frenzy, everyone else rolling their eyes as they went. But SUPER friendly when talking with you. So I commend this place for the friendly service. 

For food I got the fajita nachos. Very very good. Individual nachos are made so that you're definitely getting your money's worth on each chip. They skimped bad on the spur cream and it took 10 minutes to get a side of sour cream so the second half of my nachos were cold by the time it came around. 

Dessert-- ordered fried ice cream. 5 minutes later, queue waitress not holding my fried ice cream but instead informing us they \"ran out\".... Uh what? 

Nice staff, pretty good food. but not prepared for even twenty customers total at one time... Not cool."}
{"text":"This place deserved no stars.. It's called Chevys fresh mex but there wasn't nothing fresh about it.. The food tasted like I went home and warmed up leftovers in the microwave. Just horrible. Service was horrible.. This place really made my valentines day a total BLOW.. The \"head hancho\" gave us 20% off it should have been 50% off it was that bad.. Never will I eat here again..."}
{"text":"We drive 45 min from home to eat here.  It's hands down still the freshest, funnest, most consistent flavors you'll get and well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great Marg's, Love the shrimp & corn bread app!"}
{"text":"I like Chevy's.  It's \"good\" Mexican food.  Not great, but good.  It's more Tex-Mex than Mexican.  We like to get the mixed grill.  It has a little shrimp, chicken, steak and pork...something for everyone.  My favorite part of Chevys is the freshly made chips. Yum. The food is a little greasy and the price is a little high, but every once in a while, that's okay.  My trip today was a little disappointing since they messed up my order. Oh well...I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"The last 2 times I've been to Chevys has been very disappointing. Chevys has been my favorite restaurant for the past 4 years and lateley the food is not that great anymore. 
I always order the chicken fajitas and my son orders the mixed grill and lately the meat is dry and tough, does not have the flavor it used to, and they are skimping on the veggies and meat while they are now charging $3 to $4 more for the same meal than they used to. Also they have changed the kids menu and it's crappy compared to what it used to be. The flautas are gone which were my daughters favorite. No longer my favorite restaurant. No longer willing to pay $17.99 for mixed grill and $14.99 for chicken fajitas that are just so so."}
{"text":"Most forgetful server ever! It must have been his first night ever.... he forgot the extra plate, the extra side, chips n salsa, and most bothersome....... our drinks!!!!!! We were eating our meals and our drinks had still not arrived. And our food was spicy so we were in dire need of a drink.... then at the end he brings the bill and forgets to add the coupon we already gave him."}
{"text":"With limited options in Campaign this weekend, I suggested Chevy's. I remembered loving this place in college -- The whole \"Fresh Mex\" thing did it for me. 

Well, where to begin..... The guac was bland,  food was luke warm and my steak taco was ground beef. Also, the service was mediocre. She wasn't even bad, she just lacked a personality. Not that I wanted her to do card tricks or something, but  a little smile goes a long way.

You've been granted a 2nd star purely because of that wonderful corn mush you serve with every meal.

Bummer Chevy's... I wanted to like you."}
{"text":"My mom and I come here at least 3 times a month, we always enjoy, the food, drinks, friendly atmosphere.
The chips and salsa are the best, they make them fresh evert day, that's what makes them so good.
Kudos to Vinny he rocks at margaritas and customer service."}
{"text":"The chicken fajitas are marvelous. The tortillas are handmade and the chicken is moist and flavorable. Our waiter on this recent visit was efficient  and friendly. Our only complaint was the carnitas were loaded with fat."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Chevy's. I ordered the fajitas, which were pretty good. I got all beef. The chips and salsa were very good. I like a lot of cilantro and it was perfect. The problem with this place is the service. It took about 15 minutes after we got to our table for our server to come take our drink order. We had waited so long that we were ready to order, but he quickly said what can I get you to drink and ran away. Another 15 minutes and we got the drinks. You really can't mess up a beer order, but it happened. I ordered Coors Light, and I got Miller LIte. No No No. When I did finally get the Coors LIght it was hot. Enough said on the beer fiasco. To the food. I really like the Fajitas. They reminded me of Uncle Julio's in Dallas. Our server checked on us once but I think he was on something. He seemed really hyper and it was hard to understand him. He rushed to clear off our table before we were even finished. I would go back if I happen to be shopping in Arrowhead Mall again, but I wouldn't make a special trip. I am giving them three stars because the food was pretty good, and they are the best fajitas I have found in Arizona, but the service just sucks."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food. It started off well with the chips and salsa - the chips were hot, light, and crispy and the salsa was so good I ended up eating it literally by the spoonful.  The portions are very generous. Both my entree (fajita grilled chicken soft tacos) and my wife's were outstanding."}
{"text":"Never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me. Hands down the worst meal I have ever eaten and the worst $20 I have ever spent. I have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied. You could not pay me $20 to eat the food I ordered again.

We were starving. Neither of us had eaten all day. The first thing we did was order the Nachos. It came with \"Nacho\" liquid cheese you find at gas stations and sporting events. I am talking the pasty orange processed shit, pun fucking intended. They dumped this shit all over a giant plate of chips and sprinkled on some seasoned ground beef and charged us $9. 

N-I-N-E FUCKING DOLLARS. If I'm paying $9 for tortilla chips and cheese, I expect actual cheese, not processed liquid cheese that I can buy at Costco in eighty pound bags for $15. That's 10 cents an ounce. There was *maybe* 3 ounces of cheese on my chips. That's 30 cents of cheese which is arguably the most expensive ingredient of the dish. The entire plate of nachos probably cost them $1. 

We did not finish them. We each ate around six or seven Nacho cheese coated chips before we were saved by our entrees. Lucky us, or so we thought. Apparently \"smothered\" burritos actually means fucking coated with Nacho cheese. Fuck. You can tell I really hate this shit. Let's move on.

My $14 entree consisted of 2 tacos, 1 mini burrito, and a chimichanga. The beef in my tacos was ground fine. Real fine. So fine that you could no longer tell what part of the cow a particular granule came from. All I can say was that it was better than the refried beans of the \"just add water\" variety. Not joking. The beans were the texture of a watery soup. I think the cook added too much water to mine because when I got the plate the beans were on the left side. By the end of the meal they had oozed across the entire plate like a thick viscous creature. Like all \"just add water\" refried beans of jail cafeteria quality, it tasted like cardboard.

The chicken taco was edible. I think. I ate it at least. I was starving though. Again, we hadn't eaten all day. I didn't touch the Nacho cheese coated burritos. I tried the chimichanga last. I had two bites.

The rice was the best thing on the plate.

The service was as good as it possibly could have been. You could tell the servers did not like working there. Our server didn't bring us the check. He had the busser/dishwasher bring us the check. I don't blame him. Honestly, we felt sorry for him."}
{"text":"Well this place is off my list. They are unbelievably unreasonable. The manager has no sense whatsoever. They don't care about customers: the other reviews confirm that. The service is terrible, the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"my daughter would love to go to chevys on camelback for her bday, always fresh yummy food and the homemade chip you could see, when we found out that it close last year she ws sad, this year we found out there was one open at Arrowhead so we went up there last night for her bday dinner. The waiter was nice enough but it took awhie for anyone to come over. He only refilled half the drinks and we had to ask for the other half to be refilled, When we got our food it wasn't hot, the extra cheese my kids ordered in their burittos wasn't even melted, it was like thrown on as an after thought and the food wasn't even hot enough to melt it, the cheese on the beans and taco of other orders was so minusicle it was as much to cover my pinky nail. we had to ask for extra cheese for my sons tacos. they did still give out the chevys hat for the bday and sang to my daugher brought icecream and gave a little cone two the two siblings that were there which was nice. But the food was in no comparison to the yummy food we experienced on camelback. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We had appetizers and drinks in the bar during happy hour. Our server was also the bartender,  her name is Sabrina. She is wonderful!  We had questions about the meat sauce for the enchiladas so she brought us a sample to try. Our water glasses never were more than half empy. She was quick to ask about refills and kept our chips and salsa full without us having to ask. It was my belated birthday so she also brought the crew around to sing and brought me a sundae. The service is great here and I highly recommend the restaurant,  bar and the bartender Sabrina."}
{"text":"Bad food, worse service.

Waitress took our drink orders, and then twenty minutes later the manager came by to tell us our waitress got busy with another table and he would take our drink orders. Ten minutes later the original waitress came back to get our drink orders. Ummmm.... hello? Finally got our magaritas, which were weak as hell and way too sweet and sour.

And everything was slimy. I'm not OCD or anything but I felt the need to get up and wash my hands after flipping through the menu. And after touching the salt and pepper shakers. And after moving the itty bitty little chip basket from one side of the table to the other.

Ordered an appetizer - the Farmer's Market Quesadilla. Plate was hot but the cheese was cold. Vegetables were slimy. Tortilla was burnt. And they didn't bring us any napkins or silverware. We waited what we thought was an acceptable amount of time for someone to stop by and when nobody did I actually got up, walked across the restaurant to the hostess stand where there was a box and got them myself."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chevy's in a LONG time. My wife and I were at the Galleria Mall with our son and decided to give it a try. The food was great from the chips and salsa to the entrees. We each had the pick 2 combo (one with an enchilada and tamale, the other with a chile relleno and tamale) Our favorite part of the meal was the appetizer sampler. Especially the nacho's with the jalapeno jelly for dipping, it was the real shocker. Next time I will not opt for the chile relleno though, it was a little tough and honestly I've had better. We had our youngest child with us who ate for free because it was a tuesday, his chicken fajitas was very good, I had to sneak a bite, but it was only the fajita meat with no tortillas or toppings, but it did come with a side, we chose the fresh fruit and it also came with an ice cream cone. Caesar, our server, was very knowledgable when it came down to the menu and preparation process. He also provided very good service and stayed on top of things like keeping our drinks filled and clearing dishes from the table. Overall it was a great lunch and we look forward to returning. I gave it 4 stars mainly because I thought the chile relleno would have been a lot better."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, went in on 4/9/2015, Maria helped us great job, even helped with my rewards points since my smart phone was acting up. Great great great"}
{"text":"You know, I've got to give them 4 stars. As I always state, this is not in comparison to Posh, or Mastro's, or Ocean Prime, etc, but apples to apples people. Compared to other chain Mexican restaurants, Chevy's is a good, consistent standby. Fresh guacamole, homemade tortillas, and pretty darned decent carnitas. Call me crazy, but I'd say it's a solid dining experience. A far cry from the mass produced garbage at Macayo's, and we've always had friendly service, and they get brownie points for the military discount. Stay away from the fried ice cream though, much like everyone else's, it tastes like it's coated in corn flakes. Sadly, the best Mexican food I've ever had is in Holland, Michigan, a little hole in the wall called Margarita's. Whats up here in Arizona? I've tried Old Pueblo, Mi Patio, etc, and they are all icky, low quality, with dried out rice. so I stick with Chevy's or Z Tejas when I want something with a Mexican/Southwest flair. I think the Camelback location recently closed, so we go to the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"Love the flautas, chips and salsa which we can never get enough of, and the rice and beans are delicious :) you can share the combo platter between 2-5 different items between 2 people for about $20. A staple Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We were asked by our server if we wanted anything off the 2 for $12 app menu. Sure, we said. Any margaritas? Sure. But when our bill came, we had been charged $7 for each app and the margaritas had been upgraded without asking or offering. To try and up our check without asking for a few bucks, even if he heard we were both servers, he should be ashamed. The food was good, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon and even though they were extremely busy we got seated right away.  The asked was pleasant and helpful.  I ordered the site and turf which was AMAZING!! The crab and shrimp enchiladas are to die for!  I will definately be coming back soon :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mexican food.  Both the Commercial Mexican, and Authenticate Mexican. 

Chevy's is as good as it gets for Commercial Mexican.  I took my parents here last week, and they said it was the best Mexican they ever had. (They're not into Authentic Mexican).

Service was great, food was even better.  I would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Gave me raw meat. After I asked to speak to the manager he wouldn't come. His name was Tim. What unprofessional idiots."}
{"text":"Yum! This place is consistently good and one of the only two Mexican places that I like almost everything on the menu. Shrimp & crab enchiladas? Delicious. Service is good. I've gotten one weird waiter once or twice that likes to point at you with his pen when taking your order which bothers me. But people are weird, everywhere. I'm a frequent customer."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Chevy's in California and the one in Henderson. I must say I have never been disappointed with any item I have ordered. The only complaint I have, is I wish I  could finish an order of steak fajitas! Their chips and salsa are the best. Paired with a Cadillac margarita is nothing short of heaven."}
{"text":"Chevy's in Mesa has fallen under the spell of Jekyll & Hyde, never sure which one you will get when you visit. Sometimes the service is spot on, yet the food is off and other times the service is off and the food is worth the hassle.

Tonight's issue was with the portion size for the promotional menu. Cajun tex mex. The El \"Big Easy\" Fajitas for Two  caught our eye, and figured we could chow down on some spicy tex mex inspired by the big easy.
Wow were we wrong, the portion sizes are WAY off for the price. 

The El \"Big Easy\" Fajitas for Two - price will set you back 24 dollars, keep in mind the average single entree will run 9 - 12 . With a 24 dollar price tag comes some serious expectations, portion to match the price - this is for two people after all. I was not expecting oversized portions, but did expect to see a bit more than 1 entrees worth. The food arrived and wham disappointment set in - the size of the portion was for 1 person. Overall portion was smaller than the Mixed Grill (steak, chicken, and shrimp) was $17.99.

The food was good, but not 24 dollars good. The service was good, no concerns. 

We will go back and give Chevy's one last time...we are growing weary of the inconsistencies."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with my husband and 2 year old. Service was not great. We had to wave down other servers for napkins, refills and to go bags. We ordered the steak fajitas medium with no beans. Upon appearance, we got well done fajitas and rice and beans. The manager had them remake medium fajitas but upon tasting the next order the steak had a strong sweet marinade. We told the manager and he said that the meat is that way. I remember enjoying out fajitas here a few years ago. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"ok the highlight of my last visit BESIDES our server Marco... was the most freakingdeliciousawesome pineapple coconut margarita. I can sum it up in one word. 
YUMMY! 
I actually wish I would have had three of those instead of my meal ... but my meal was pretty good also and so I only had ONE.
The Chips were good. 
The fajitas were good. 
But the margarita... phenomenal ... 
I think my next time there will just be a chips and salsa... margarita day...
anyone wanna join me?"}
{"text":"Not a good first visit.  Menu very miss leading, up sale built-in to the menu,  stated 9.99, but really 15.99 when all said and done.  Services very slow!! No will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is decent to above average. Tthe reason I go is for the best Margaritas in town. The mandarin margarita I had there was pure bliss."}
{"text":"Love the food and the margaritas are great!  Love the option of outdoor seating too.  One suggestion though.  Get rid of the convex metal plates used for serving fajitas.  The convex design makes the food naturally fall off the plate and the plate does not sit in it's stand very well at all.  The plate always falls off the stand.  I have a 3\" burn on my right forearm from this happening two nights ago."}
{"text":"Awful all I can say service was the worst, the food was cold the guacamole tasted like the one you get in a can.  Very dirty tables they where very sticky moved twice you get the feeling that there going out of business not enough help walked out of there will never go back . Tried to talk to management they never showed  up ok .  Hasta La vista Adiós will take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"So after having a not-so-great experience with the service at our most recent visit to Chevy's, I decided to make a comment through their website. I was pleasantly surprised that I had a response from the regional manager. . . THAT DAY! We are a fan of Chevy's food which is why I was really sad to have the negative experience, but the quick response from the management side was unbelievable. I hope internally the problem was resolved, but as a customer they've won back my loyalty. I will visit again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a great family restaurant! They are always consistent with great food and great service. It's not authentic mexican but more like americanized version. This isn't a bad thing either their food is great! They have good drinks too try the pirate punch it is addicting! !!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place can be a hit or miss but I am absolutely in love with their tamale plate. I get their chicken tamales with a green chili sauce. It comes with a big plate of rice and bean and all you can eat chips. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Chevys used to be so good. Now they suck. Menu sucks. Options suck. Food sucks. If you want authentic Mexican food don't go here. Might as well eat at home I make better Mexican food and it's authentic. Only reason I give two stars is because my drink was good."}
{"text":"I used to really like this chain and their food over 10 years ago in California. I decided to try it again after that long break and was hoping to have the same experience. Unfortunately, it's gone downhill--the food. I don't even remember what the service was like, but I do remember that I did like the food. It's too bad it has changed. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chevy's for many years now and will continue eating there. I love their complimentary chips and salsa...so good. I've ordered just about everything on the menu. Great restaurant, always received good service, reasonable price and their restrooms are always clean. :)"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I've had by far. The staff was extremely rude and brought us the worst margaritas. When brought to the managers attention, he did not seem to care. 10 out of 10 would never come back."}
{"text":"Ok, so to all of those yelpers who give Chevy's a low rating because it's not \"authentic\"...? That's like giving Spam a bad review for not being \"real meat\".... Duh! We all know it's not authentic, but we're not going to Chevy's to eat authentic food, we're going there because it tastes good.

With that out of the way, I absolutely adore Chevy's. Their homemade tortillas are amazing, and everything I've ever had at Chevy's is delicious. 

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is just because the service can sometimes be a little \"off\". Other than that, I LOVE it."}
{"text":"Went for my husbands birthday today and as always it was amazing!!! Omg the combo fajitas were to die for..... The service from the hostess to our waiter Angel, to the manager of the restaurant was above and beyond. Kudos to Chevy's, you guys are awesome."}
{"text":"It has improved....must be new staff/manager-

Food comes out fast and just the way you ordered it! Good job guys!
keep it up!"}
{"text":"Chevy's has been one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas! Now it's closed! This is an absolute shame! Shame! Where am I going to get some quality Tex-Mex food? No where! I'm pissed that they closed this location! #BringBackChevy's"}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars.

Chevy's has that perfect Happy Hour environment all day long.  Bright colors, fast moving waiters (even when the service is slow the waiters seem to be flying by!), plenty of activity, huge drinks, and food that all seems like it's an appetizer.

The chips and salsa are wonderful. . .beware you sometimes find the hot spot in the salsa and then burn for a bit.  If you are lucky enough to have an attentive waiter you may even get the basket refilled.

As I mentioned, there are always a bunch of waiters in bright red shirts flying this way and that, but they seem to rarely stop at your table to fill your drinks.

The food has the typical tex-mex flair...so it depends on your personal taste.  Being in Arizona, most seem to want that authentic homemade Mexican food taste...this is that more polished chain restaraunt taste.

This location is connect to Arrowhead Mall...so you can also sit out on the patio and people watch...."}
{"text":"Great dinner.  My daughter and I split the mixed grill fajitas and still had some to take home. My twelve year old can eat. Our server Sarai was the best ever. She needs a raise and promotion"}
{"text":"Chevy's is fresh-Mex, not Tex-Mex, don't get it twisted. I was a fan of this chain when I lived in CA, and am glad we have a location in town- it's probably a good thing that it's far away from me, because I'd come in and eat their chips and salsa way too often if they were closer.

The combo plates are my usual go-to, the five piece is even enough for me and my guy to share- sometimes we add on the tortilla soup. The cheese enchiladas with meat sauce and their tamales are great options, and my BF always hogs the crispy tacos and chile relleno. 

We recently came in with a group, and our server was great about getting our orders out quickly, constantly refilling the chips and salsa, and making sure we had everything we needed. She was really nice, too. Location is going for a cantina atmosphere but seems a little too dark to me. Easy exterior entrance and outdoor dining area are bonuses."}
{"text":"Not too bad... The service in the bar area was exceptional, but also we were the only ones in there at the time. Their happy hour prices are pretty good, we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Not thrilled. Use to like this place but service has gone downhill. Salsa isn't the same freshness and nothing special with the food. Seemed bland."}
{"text":"Just now getting to this review from this place I went to couple months back.  Note: Not really big fan of Fresh Mex /Tex Mex cuisine to begin with.  Anyways the last time I ate at a Chevys was years ago when I was in Cali for Happy Hour. Even then it  reminded me of frozen Mexi dinners. I ended up here  because it was the only restaurant that wasn't as busy unlike the mall food court which was full and so was other restaurant that was across this place.  

I was greeted  & seated right away but it took about 10 minutes before a server showed up at my table to take my drink order.  My drink from the bar showed up in no time, but not my waiter...where the heck was she??  The place was not busy at all, especially the tables in her area (there were 3 other tables) I waited another FIFTEEN minutes and was thinking of taking off and just paying for my drink when she showed up finally.  Well  it took another 15 minutes from when she took my order till the food was dropped on my table...literally.  Server mumbled the order plopped it on my table and dashed off pretty much.  I took a double take on what was just served and Im saying to myself, \"Un effin believable, what's that on my plate??\" You know picture happy me took a pic and posted it on my other social media page and even my friends commented and had the same reaction as I did.  

The presentation was the worse Ive ever seen, looked like a mish mash  of....food I guess, just thrown together at the last minute.  To be fair, it was edible and the flavors of the sherry chipotle sauce complemented the Shrimp Tomatillo dish.  Well now I remember why I avoid Chevys, the  food is nothing to write home  about and neither is the service apparently.   Thank goodness for my margarita, now that was good!  It saved that dinner experience.  No wonder why my friends that go here have drinks first.  You cant be sober eating the food here. I gave an additional star only because of the drink."}
{"text":"Good food and happy hour (all day). Margs a little on the sweet and sour side. service was ok nothing great"}
{"text":"I had been here once before years ago so this was like my first trip. I received some great coupons in the mail and decided to try it out with my babe. Atmosphere was great! We both got the E-3 (not valid with the coupon but still a great price at $11.99) deal which is the appetizer, Entree and dessert. I started the meal with their homemade Tortilla soup which was delish! Second course was their mini chicken fajita dinner with rice and beans which wasn't all that mini in my opinion. Topped it off with a mini fried ice cream which was amazing and again not all that mini. The tortillas that came with the fajitas were made fresh and hot right there so that was a HUGE plus and the never ending chips and salsa didn't hurt either. I will definitely be back. We paid less than $40 for two three course meals, drinks and the tip for the amazing food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to meet up at the Biltmore Chevy's for happy hour quite frequently and were bummed out when it closed. We went to the Arrowhead location for dinner Friday night and were sat right away, had excellent service, and delicious food. The waiter even brought my parents dessert for their anniversary. Surprisingly, one of the same employees was still working there and mentioned to me that our favorite waitress from the Biltmore location was still working for the company at the Mesa location. This is obviously a great company that hires great people! I expressed my compliments of the server to the manager because it was such a great experience. And the kiwi margarita was amazing!"}
{"text":"Way to hot inside this joint. I hope they fix this soon or someone will faint! Food was good, amazing hostess named Violet. She was so nice and warm. Thanks"}
{"text":"Every time I  come here, there is bad service.

This afternoon, we were seated quickly, and our waitress passed us a few times before getting our drink order.

Upon ordering drinks, i ordered my daughter Mac and cheese. We ordered our lunch after she came back, and the salad, and soup that we asked for took an exceptionally long time. About 20 minutes.... we didnt even get to finish them before our large plates came out.

Also, we asked 3 seperate times for hot sauce.. Halfway  through the meal,  it arrived. 

Also, during our meal, she only brought us one \"extra\" glass of water. I guess we were all supposed to share this glass of water....?

But, the thing that really upset me was when we went to pay. We had seperated checks, and my friend paid with her card, and i paid with cash. Well, lets just say that when my friend got her card back, i didnt get my change.

I mean, it wasnt a large amount  (less than $5). But, the waitress just assumed that the change was her tip. not a good business practice..............."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here and hostess was nice and cheerful. Our waitress was very polite and funny very good customer service.

I ordered the surf and turf which consists of crab fajita, grilled chicken soft taco and Mexican rice with grilled steak, it was amazing! 

Great atmosphere for a Mexican restaurant, it feels like a Mexican tgi Friday and oh yeah there's a bar section as well."}
{"text":"My favorite part of Chevy's is the chips and salsa, which is why I am giving this 3 stars.  The Chips and Salsa are very good.  Chips almost always come out hot and fresh, and the salsa has a very good flavor to it.  I love salsa though, and it always bugs me when these places bring you a bowl of chips and a little tiny bowl of salsa which is what happens at Chevy's.  I get about 10 chips in, and already need more salsa.  The food is 'OK' here.  I don't think I have ever had a bad experience, but at the same time I have gotten the same foods several other places that were better.  The simple cheese enchiladas just don't have the same great flavor I wish them to have, the enchilada sauce is a little plain, or they don't put enough on it.  Burritos are pretty huge, but I honestly have not tried one myself.  Others I have eaten with ordered burritos and said they were good, but until I have one, I cannot say for sure.  Prices are a bit spendy here too.  I think most combination plates are about 10% higher than they should be.  They try to make it look like it's worth the cost by bringing your food out on this huge plate, but really most of the plate is filled with decoration and empty space is left all over.  If you like to drink, they have a good selection of beers, wines, margaritas or whatever, but since I do not drink I cannot comment on the quality or price.  This location is in the MALL, so it can be convenient if shopping in the area, but can also cause the place to be louder if that is something that would bother people.  If I have the option, I will save my money and go to El Torito instead."}
{"text":"This place is a great option when given the choice of the food court nearby. Usually shop at Arrowhead Mall for clothes since they have a better selection than PV. This is the last Chevys in town since they closed the rest of them.

I love the Sizzling Fajitas at this place and that is what I always order. It is really good and comes out on a smoking hot plate making all sorts of fun noises. The meat is always tender with a lot of flavor. The wife usually gets the Fajita Salad with the Sizzling Chicken.

Really like their homemade tortillas that used to come out of a niffy machine off to the side. Not sure if that machine is still functioning any more. Looked like they could have been made by hand this visit. OK with me.

The menu is rather large with lots of choices. The Chips and Salsa are definitely a score. I would recommend staying away from the standard items such as tacos, burritos, etc. There are too many great hole in the wall places around town with the authentic stuff for cheap.

Our server did a great job although he seemed to be overworked with too many tables. Saw several other servers just standing around. The manger even seemed a bit out of sorts as he paced the floor back and forth. Even saw a bit of the Seinfeld nose episode. Was it a scratch or the pick? Good thing that sizzling fajita plate is hot. ¡LO SIENTO!

3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been going to Chevy's for forever. Not so much in Vegas, but all over California. I know what to expect, I'm not looking for fancy, just mildly satisfying. 
So. Tonight my family, there were 7 adults and 3 kids, went to this location for dinner. We arrived at 6:30. Placed our orders, got a few beverages, and waited... And waited and waited. An hour later, mind you they were not very busy, and maybe two check in's from our waitress, our food starting coming out. Some of it. I didn't receive my soup and salad, and my uncle didn't get his enchiladas. We had no silverware, no tortillas for fajitas at the table, and my nieces kids meal was wrong. Went tried to find our waitress, couldn't, ended up robbing other tables for silverware and I went to get tortillas. Then I asked for the manager.
Tony came over and we got off on the wrong foot. He was combative and went about addressing our issues all kinds of wrong. He essentially was asking for our missing orders all over again... I told him to check with the server and the kitchen for our orders, because placing them now isn't going to do us any good. He was yelling over the long table to my uncle asking over and over for his order until my uncle finally said never mind on the food at all. Tony disappeared, the only food to come out after that was a chicken taco for my niece that had cheese on the plate despite us saying she had a severe dairy allergy... and the food that was there (that we waited an hour for) was all cold! 
I could tell Tony wasn't the GM, sure enough he was an assistant manager, so I asked for the GM's card, and despite them comping the whole meal, I will still be reaching out to him. Ordinarily I would've tipped the waitress despite the comp but I couldn't justify it given the lack of service. Missing meals, combined with bad food and even worse customer service is truly unacceptable. Even when it's free."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch thinking oh this will be nice until.. Hostess was not friendly or welcoming. Server forgot my water then remember once she looked at me and brought it and she apologized, but it's not busy so I don't know how she really forgot. I said it's fine. Then I asked her for not spicy salsa she said it's a dollar more for Pico de gallo. That's all they have that's not hot. Since it's free chips and salsa. Well it's to hot for me to eat so can you just satisfy the costumer? Then the next thing I asked for fajita chicken instead of salsa chicken, but come to find out I have to wait 10 more minutes because it's not done marinating.. Well damn another strike for me. I was going to grab the manager, but you know what's the point.. I just won't ever come back here again. Thanks Chevys fresh mex. Also your hostess did not even bother to acknowledge me on the way out. To busy chitchatting with another worker at the podium. Disappointing. I sent this into corporate since I had such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Two issues: The El Machino tortilla station was devoid of people and the salsa was way spicier than I recall in any CA Chevy's. It was so spicy that this white boy was sweating through the cheap paper napkins (5) that this place provides. Another free birthday meal and chicken fajitas were the choice. Chicken was sliced too thin,  but had no trace of the promised spices and chilies. It was just grilled chicken with plenty of onions and peppers and the usual condiments. Still, a solid safe choice for a chain, but not sure why every waiter in the bar was gay. Nothing wrong with that, but both my waiter and my chip and salsa guy were on the other team and that was a bit unusual. Also, I know it's a Mexican chain, but we are in America and nobody really needs to listen to full-on Mexican tunes during dinner. IF i want the full experience, I will just go the east side of Vegas and find some taco joint with bars on the windows."}
{"text":"Had chicken fajitas and other had a combo plate.  Food was very good.  The service was great!  Greeted immediately.  The staff were attentive.  Sat on the patio, on a semi-cool evening and all the heaters were lit.   The margarita was not the old from the 80's haha, but was not lacking in alcohol.   The food was hot, which is always a plus for me!  Overall very good"}
{"text":"Good service horrible food... taquitos from 7/11 are better than the flautas, Chile relleno it's like I'm eating a ball of cheese. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I haven't been here in years, we were hungry ,cruising the mall and stumbled upon Chevy's.The staff was quickly to seat us in a friendly manner. All good. we order drinks that quickly came out, perhaps too quick. Are eager and attentive waiter quickly spilled an entire Chesney's pirate punch down my back. The look on his face was priceless as was mine. So apparently if you get a drink thrown at you you get  a beautiful Chevys T-shirt:). aside from getting soaked the service was good experience good now to decide the stars..."}
{"text":"This place used to offer such great Happy Hour pricing. But alass the times have set in.  

Seems like happy hour pricing is now just Margaritas and draft.  They used to offer some great appetizers too. 

ps.  CLEAN YOUR LAMP SHADES!! we sat at a booth... then looked up at the lampshade over our food... it was so disgusting!!

our waiter dissapeared when it came to pay? really odd"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Really good food and great service. Every time we are in Vegas we make the drive to Henderson and eat at Chevy's!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was in the mood for Mexican food! Was sat immediately with no wait, but then sat there at the table for about 15-20 mins with no server or anything.... Finally someone came over and asked if we had been helped. By that time we already picked out what we wanted. Overall good was great, service I'm not so sure about...."}
{"text":"I've happily eaten at Chevy's since they opened up in the mall, so I was a little surprised to come to Yelp and see so many so-so or even bad reviews. I LOVE Chevy's! Their salsa is amazing! I could literally drink it and as soon as it's brought to my table I ask the server for a second one. Delicious! The chips are AWESOME! Crispy, salted perfectly and hot most of the time. Fresh tortillas? Yum! 

I've had great service at Chevy's, and a few so-so times, but nothing horrible. The food is always good, comes out pipping hot on burning hot plates. I love the meat sauce that comes on the enchiladas. I love that you can order your enchiladas in flour tortillas and not get a weird look. 

Chicken Fajitas are one of my favorites at Chevy's. I like my chicken well done, and my veggies practically burnt. Our waiter today (was in today, was in last week, like I said, LOVE this place) said he was in culinary school and he made sure my veggies came out how I wanted them. I really appreciated this. For the most part the servers pay attention to detail, and are quick to refill water and iced tea. I just ask if I want something, it's a small place so there's always a server, even if it's not yours, walking by. 

Granted there are times they could use another Server or two, but the restaurant business is hard to predict. You have a full staff on, and they stand around. Send a few people home and all of a sudden there's a line at the door. Never fails. 

So I give Chevy's 5 Stars. I definitely recommend it to others. I meet friends there for dinner. Great place overall."}
{"text":"Oh Chevys, how I have missed you since your departure from the shores of north lake, Woodbridge in irvine, ca. But here you are again, of all places, galleria mall in Henderson. 

Why is Chevys so awesome? First, the chips. They're fried from really thin pieces of tortilla making them extra crispy and light tasting. Next, they have great, fresh salsa, complimentary with the chips. I love their crispy shell tacos, although I wish they had a shredded beef option instead of their ground beef. You can get a combo plate for less than 15 bucks and it comes with your choice of enchilada, chile relleno, or even another taco (my choice). The plate also has sides of sweet corn cake, beans, and rice. 

They also have a seasonal lemonade, my favorite has been the watermelon. I have tried their flan and fried ice cream, both very delicious as well.

The service is usually good, however I have had one moron tell me I couldn't get a booth because the section was closed - it was full and had a couple servers walking through it. 

It's great for kids, as I can speak from my own childhood in Irvine, and you are definitely depriving them if you don't take them here. They'll even do a birthday song for you and I think some small dessert.

I don't believe I have seen any souvenir Chevy's bucket sombreros that I recall from a while back, wtf?"}
{"text":"The service was slow and the waiter was forgetful though pleasant. But the worst part was that the food was terrible and all the smokers were out that evening. We went out for dinner with the kids and sat outside to get some fresh air. It was 5pm so we figured it was optimal time to go out with the kids. Little did we know we were all going to get asphyxiated from smoke inhalation. We just moved here from out of state and I didn't realize how backwards Arizona is, environmentally speaking. They allow people to smoke at restaurants, they spray pesticides everywhere! No one is concerned about what they are breathing. Anyway the food portion was so tiny and we paid 11.99 for it. I won't go back."}
{"text":"this seems to be a great place to nurse a hang over with a little hair of the dog with the locals. Bar Tender was great and the beer was Ice cold."}
{"text":"Janette has suggested some wonderful choices for my lovely wife and I. The food is fresh and the service is great."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Chevys @1335 S. Alma School Rd for years and last night I had yet another great experience. The classic chicken fajitas are always perfect and the handmade tortillas are doughy and always fresh.  If you have ever been to Chevys and seen the yellow mass of joy on every plate, that is a sweetly perfect contrast to every savory bite, called Corn Tomalito. I always put a thin coating of Tomalito on each tortilla and the combination of flavors works perfectly. Our server was Cece and she was a delight and made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Chevy's has amazing freshly made tortillas, but watch out because they're tiny and each one surprisingly contains 167 calories. They also make great quesadillas but only if they're made on their homemade tortillas. Their margaritas and desserts are also delectable, especially the little cinnamon-sugar tortilla cones with vanilla ice cream. I always had a blast here as a kid when they gave you a free sombrero on your birthday."}
{"text":"Well, we were trying to find \"cheese dip\" in Vegas.  Some kind of Tex-Mex.  We found it.  Let me tell you, that was the best thing about this place.  The cheese dip was actually pretty good and a very ample serving.  Chips were thin, crispy and not too salty.  We really liked it until the entrees came.  Ugh!!  Pork tamales tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in them.  Pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat.  The cheese enchiladas were, um, cheesy.  That's about it.  Not much taste at all.  Refried beans were smoky and not horrible.  But the rice, was the worst Mexican/Spanish rice I have ever put in my mouth.  Terrible!!  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because our server, Boone, was awesome.  It's not his fault the food stank.  I would not go there again, unless I was just wanting cheese dip and no entrees.  If you're looking for Mexican OR Tex-Mex, you can do a LOT better."}
{"text":"One of my familys favorites. Its to bad that they are clear across town. I live one the Northwest side. So its a treat when when we happen to be on that side of town. We love the chips and salsa(I can eat all day). The service and food is always good."}
{"text":"I wish I knew more about Mexican food. It would let me know what I was talking about when I was to demean restaurants such as this one when they claim they serve Mexican food.  Maybe I am expecting to much going to a chain but shouldn't I at least deserve mediocrity?

When the first thing you serve me is under cooked chips and place them on my table with what is best described as thimble sized portions of completely ordinary salsa, then we are off to a rough start.  Maybe the Mexican aspect of the restaurant comes from the fact that I needed to speak Spanish to order. I finally convinced the waiter of my order which was to be chicken quesadilla. The soda machine must have been non functional the day I ate at this location because I only received 2 drinks during my visit. When the quesadilla arrived I wished I had just gone to Taco Bell which I had originally contemplated before parking for Chevy's. The tortilla and cheese was standard fare but the chicken must have just come from the freezer. Bland, dry, and I could barely believe it was there. 

No more ignoring ratings. I joined Yelp to let fellow food connoisseurs guide me in my dining experiences and I ignored them this time. For this, I apologize. I hereby declare from this day forward I will stop going against your recommendations and follow your advice. This experience taught me you all know what you are talking about!"}
{"text":"Love this place ate at many times in San Jose area when they came to Colorado we were happy not the same and not as good tried the one at this location and it was great, always fresh, love the salsa and chips will go back many times since we are moving to this area!!"}
{"text":"For a \"chain\" mex joint the food is good.  We only sit at the bar so our service is great.  Draft Dos XX  is always welcomed and the fresh tortilla's are great."}
{"text":"Really good guacamole, citrus kicked taco good. Highly recommend the coconut pineapple margarita."}
{"text":"Just got a free entree coupon for my kiddo's half-birthday. Seriously? Who else celebrates your half-birthday?? Join their Compadres Club and reap the same rewards. Now we have another good (enough) reason to go have a margarita. Thanks Chevy's!"}
{"text":"Wow, what happened? We were SO looking forward to great tex-mex and we left vowing never to return again.

There was one girl waiting the entire restaurant when we got there (4pm on Sun) and she was trying her best to get to everyone. When we finally recieved our order - chx fajitas and the chx salad, 10 mins later my husband had to ask somone for the tortillas and by then, his stuff was cold...all 5 peices of meat and a couple of peppers. My salad resembled a kid's meal - could it get any smaller? Yes, it tasted ok, but between the service and small portions, will definitely not be going back.

Too bad, we really liked Chevy's in CA. Will do Chipotle instead out here."}
{"text":"They have permanently closed! I wonder what restaurant will replace it at the busy galleria mall. Prime location"}
{"text":"So here's the breakdown:

Service: Average. We sat with empty drinks and an empty chip basket for longer than I'd like. 

Food: I had fish tacos (I get them at so many places that I can get a feel for a place just from the tacos!). The tacos were large and filled with tasty things. The fish was salmon, which I've never encountered in a fish taco before, but it was good. Rice and black beans were tasty. This probably would have gotten another star had it not been for Boyfriend's food. He got the \"Grande Chimichanga\". First off, not so grande. His words: \"it was a greasy tortilla filled with badly seasoned ground beef.\" He said he would have been better off at Taco Bell. Ouch. Now, never in the 5+ years of our relationship have I seen him stop eating a meal before he was full. Today, that changed. He left probably a quarter of the chimichanga on the plate; he said it was just too bad to finish. Frankly, I'm still a bit shocked. 

The lesson: \"You're better off at Taco Bell.\""}
{"text":"I liked it, but my boyfriend hated it.  I might be able to talk him into going back for a happy hr or something.  They have good specials and a nice setup for drinks with friends, but no way will he want to go back at lunch time."}
{"text":"I only come here for their shrimp and crab enchiladas topped with pesto spicy sauce, Delushious!  You get two enchiladas with veggies and rice or beans on the side. It's affordable and fills you up. Oh and I love love their salsa!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Pricy for being in a mall, and the waitress never let us know about any specials."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for lunch. 

Boyfriend and I ordered the tableside guac as an appetizer and shared a 3 item combo platter. The guacamole was pretty good, I'll give them that. But our 3 item combo was not. We got one beef enchilada, one chicken enchilada and a shredded beef tamale. And as usual, combo platters come with rice and beans.

My beef enchilada was disgusting!!!! The meat was especially disappointing! Looked and tasted like Taco Bell's taco meat. If I was blind folded and given a taste test, take one bite out of a Taco Bell beef taco and one bite out of Chevys beef enchilada.....I would have guessed both ground beef were from Taco Bell. Ugh...horrible. My boyfriend didn't care too much for his chicken enchilada either. He said it tasted bland. Our tamale was a step above the enchiladas though. They used shredded beef (thank goodness it wasn't that nasty Taco Bell meat). Sauce was flavorful and it was pippin hot. Our enchiladas tasted like they've been sittin' out for awhile. 

We definitely WILL NOT be back. 1 star for the chips + salsa + tableside guac and 1 star for the tamale."}
{"text":"We love Chevy's and eat it a lot back home in CA. Now we live in Las Vegas and the only Chevy's is ALLLL the way in Henderson, at the Galleria. A good 35 minutes from our neighborhood in Centennial Hills. Servers are always very nice, chips and salsa is always on point. Only reason to not give 5 stars: It's hit or miss if the kitchen gets modifications correct. We have had to send entrees back for quick fixes a few times, but the servers are always very quick to take care of it."}
{"text":"Glad to see this location is closed. I worked there in 2001. The owner (Mohamed Hussein) and management were not only unpleasant, but criminal. 

They were involved in a pattern of stealing wages from employees. Mind you, the hourly wage was $3.09, which makes stealing employees' paltry wages even more despicable.

Every month I had to approach them explaining how the hours on my paycheck were short. Each time they would pay me what I was owed. When I quit, I had to complain to the State Labor board when they failed to send me my final check and ignored my letters requesting payment.

Now I am a prosecutor and handle (among other things) financial fraud."}
{"text":"First time here a couple of days ago: The bartender was cool, we came in for happy hour and enjoyed ourselves. I was surprised to find out that they make micheladas :) we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife ate here years ago and I am not planning on going back to update this review, so here it goes. Wow talk about bad tasting food, never and I mean never in my life have the walked out leaving the whole plate of food on the table and still paid for the meal. It had no taste what so ever, I mean I grew up in a little mexican town so I know what it should taste like and it was not even close. Taco Bell has better tasting mexican food. Oh and my wife threw up in the parking lot so you know how her experience was. Just bad food."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch they got the best liunch specials, the bar tender is the nicest guy. Good Food Good Service"}
{"text":"Surprisingly I enjoyed this experience. I had the veggie quesadilla with pineapple salsa. It was delicious. I'm disappointed in the kids food though. I ordered Isaiah my 3 year old kids tacos and they charged me 8 dollars be user it was a special order due to his allergies. Wasn't thrilled. However I was seated quickly, chips came out quick and so did the water. I would t go out of my way to eat here but I'll eat here if I'm in the mall"}
{"text":"Amazing service, a large menu with plenty of veg options, very reasonable prices and a terrific tequila selection makes this a good choice for everyone, any time."}
{"text":"Last Chevys location near Vegas. Great chips salsa chicken fajitas. Love this place.  Hope they stay open because their fajitas and chips and nachos are world class."}
{"text":"I went to Chevy's the other night with a friend for drinks and dinner. I hadn't been there in about 10 years and remember it not being that great before. However, this time, the food was very good. I ordered some kinda of alcoholic punch which was delicious and refreshing along with a flauta enchilada combo, refried beans, rice, and tamalito. The flauta's were golden brown, crispy, and the filling was tasty. But what made them even better was the jalapeno jelly served with them. When the flauta's were gone, I found myself searching for something else on my plate to put jalapeno jelly on. The salsa chicken enchilada was terrific with a great filling, tender, moist chicken, and the sauce on top, though not like other enchilada sauces Ive tasted, was very delicious. The refried beans were surprisingly very good as well. I also was in heaven with the tamalito (Scoop of sweet corn masa?). I have a weight loss book that specifically states not to eat the tamalito from Chevys as it will kill you but I just don't see how its possible to go there and not eat it. Its just that good that I will risk whatever curse falls upon me for eating it. Lastly, their chips and salsa were some of the better ones from a Mexican Restaurant. The salsa was really cold which is what I like actually and had a good amount of spice and the chips were light and crispy, another thing I like. 
So there you have it, the food was pretty good, however, the service kinda sucked. The girl that was waiting on us was terrible. She acted put off when she arrived with chips and we told her we were waiting for another table in back of us to be cleaned and we were moving. Then our drinks took forever to come out. And the concluding factor that she was a terrible waitress was when she came over, asked the table next to us how their food was (we had our food too), then leaves without even asking us anything. WTF? Oh and then we asked her about a coupon when she brought the bill and shocker! she didn't know sh** about that either. Needless to say, this is where I had to drop Chevy's from the 4 stars I so wanted to give them to 3. Boooo to you crappy waitress.
One final word of advise: This is not true Mexican food, its more like texmex. However, if you like just plain out good tasty food without considering the authenticity, you will like Chevy's. If you are prissy and must have authentic true Mexican food, then you probably shouldn't go here."}
{"text":"This rating is solely based on a take out order. The food was ready when I came to pick it up, I was in and out fairly quickly. I ordered 2 combo plates, one was a cheese enchilada and chile relleno and chicken flautas with another chile relleno. The problem is that one of the chile rellenos had a broken toothpick inside of it, luckily I didn't swallow it and it didn't cut up the inside of my mouth. Needless to say we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"This place has both amazing service and flavor. As soon as we arrived the host noticed our 3 year old, got her crayons, paper, and a ball of dough to play with, our server Sherry was awesome, it felt like we were conversing with an old friend and she was on top of refills, napkins (3 year old, napkins are a necessity), and dessert. Now the food, I have never enjoyed Mexican food this much before, I ordered the surf and turf platter and it was fantastically delicious, I'm stuffed and yet I'm salivating thinking about it. So in sum, if you're looking for incredible food and service, definitely, eat at Chevy's. 

* I should clarify, as a Mexican myself, no I wouldn't call this authentic Mexican food but definitely, Mexican cuisine inspired and elevated."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there yesterday.  Prices are out of sight for this ole Texas boy.  Back home lunch usually costs us about $15 and we can hardly walk from being so full.  Here the bill was $27 and only one of us had a coke with lunch.   Meat was tough and had no favor what so ever.  Wife's platter was a little better but not up to Texas standards.
If you're going to call yourself a \"Tex-Mex\" resturant you ought to know about real Tex-Mex food.  Service wasn't up to standard either.  Had to ask for more chips and salsa and didn't get a two coke until he delivered the bill.  He had walked past our table more than twice while my glass was empty.  I will stay home next time I'm in the mood for Tex-Mex and make it myself."}
{"text":"BEST SALSA + CHIPS in Vegas and CHIPS anywhere I have been in the world. I usually make myself sick on chips + salsa because they are addicting. Their chips are the thinnest you will ever try.
Now the food............. Basically edible but not bad but not good barely too enjoyable.
I have been here 40+ times for chips + salsa and have tried the entire menu for the most part. 
There is a fajita salad which is not bad if you hold the dressing and just put more SALSA on it, The other thing which is a good value and pretty tasty is the mixed grill fajitas. And the Corn Cake appetizer. I advise do not try anything else besides these items unless you want to be disappointed. But the chips + salsa make up for everything."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm crab and shrimp quesadilla, specialty margaritas with Patron and a fresh orange. Mmmmmm Vincent and Antonio......I mean; you guys ROCK! Best service, great bartender, happiness! Lots of laughs! Happy Birthday Beth!!! We'll be back next weekend to do it again!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Chevy's.  Too long.  I absolutely LOVE their salsa.  Love the smokey/roasted flavor.  Their chips are great too - light & crispy.  They also have a prickly pear margarita that is QUITE tasty.  But really, it's their salsa I go for.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.... mmm, salsa."}
{"text":"My mother loves this place.  She's 71.  'Nuff said.  But seriously, this place is okay.  I don't mind eating here when my mother asks me for it, but I highly doubt I would come here of my own free will.  Although the food is okay, it's not something I'll crave on a regular basis.  Still, good eats with mama is always nice.

When we eat here my mother raves about their chile relleno.  I'm more in to the whole fresh chips and salsa (which is free) with an order of queso fundido.  I also stick to the pork tacos with their hot salsa.  That's always fine.

Not bad for an uber-Mexican themed restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great. Salsa was really good. The only thing I didn't care much for is their prices. I think they should be a tad lower. The service was decent, but our waiter could have been a little more attentive. He was nice, though."}
{"text":"My family of six and I celebrated a grandson's birthday and Chevys was his choice for tonight's dinner. Everything was perfect,  the food was great, came out of the kitchen hot and fresh.  Maria, our waitress stayed with us and made sure that we were well taken care of. I love this place.!  They have to best chips and salsa anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is highly underrated. Only location in LV. The service is consistently good and for people watching I give it an A++. 
Have a  free meal in your b-day or if you're holiday shopping and need a cool drink have a \"Cadillac\" margarita."}
{"text":"I come for the corn cake.  When Chi Chis went under I mourned the loss of my dearly departed friend, the corn cake.  Then, a couple of years ago, we stop in here for an only slightly extended work lunch, and all of a sudden 'Reunited' is playing in the background as the corn cake arrives at my table.

I can't even tell you what entree I order.  It's good, but, like, OK good.  My only request to my waiter is 'bring corn cake, sub all sides for corn cake... corn cake!'  One time I had a waiter bring more corn cake then entree.  I told him I loved him and left a hefty tip.

Ooh, I just remembered something I get.  Corn cake (kidding).  There's a build your own combo, and one of the items is a chicken flauta with a jalapeno jelly sauce.  That sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"Not very good.   I showed up for a 2 pm lunch.  The server bothered me by calling me, \"My Man\" and by trying to sell me on everything.  I do not want a Cadillac margarita!   I really wanted steak fajitas, but at $17.49 you have priced me out.  I settled for the chicken fajitas.  Lunch portion.  Wow. Tiny. No flavor.  No veggies. No sour cream. No guacamole. And by no, I mean barely.  Also, small basket of chips.  Super small bowl of salsa. $6.29 for a beer?  On draft? Really?"}
{"text":"Oh Chevy's!!! I really wish you had more than one location in Clark County lol. I can't say Las Vegas because you don't even have one in Las Vegas! I do believe the drive to Henderson every once in a while when I want some great Mexican food and even better margarita's is worth it for SURE! I use to come here a lot more when I lived on the southeast part of town! My most recent visit was during Cino de Mayo and WOW they had some awesome drink special and $2 tacos and they were HUGE! Our waitress was amazing and she really hooked up us on those drinks because literally after 2 drinks we had to take a break! Made strong and good! Yum! I have been reminded on why I need to come visit more often! If you are in the area from 3pm-7pm they have an awesome happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"Food is still excellent, one of the best places for fajitas and mexican salads. However, the service has been going down hill. Waiting too long for things, checks being wrong, and service staff doesn't really give a rats a-- about serving you."}
{"text":"Came here post movie for some lunch. After watching Riddick, all that action made us super hungry and Chevy's was a convenient walk from the theater.

The staff was super friendly, and we enjoyed two giant sized margaritas that came with super nachos as recommended. Surprisingly it was a deal when ordering this combination instead of ordering margaritas separately. I enjoyed my drink so much that I ended up spilling the last bit, and you know what the waiter did? He gave us several coupons for more discounted margaritas and food! Bring on the fun! 

The steak fajitas were really good! I feel like you get more meat and fresher less processed meat here than you would at Chilis, but regardless I enjoyed them. It was such a treat to see the tortillas made before your eyes and then eat them fresh immediately. Despite being a chain, I'm a fan and i don't know why I didn't return sooner!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area, and ran across this place by pure accident. We were pleasantly surprised. My picky kids even enjoyed it. The fresh tortillas and chips and queso dip were awesome. Great food and terrific service."}
{"text":"Been to this location numerous times and always enjoyed the food and service. Went tonight ( on a Tuesday) during $3 tacos and MARGARITAS . There was also a HUGE banner promoting that kids eat free on Tuesday's. When the waitress came to take our order we asked about the $3 drinks and tacos and we were informed us that it was only available at the bar. Since we had a 4 yr old with us this was not exactly an option,understandably. So we jus ordered the regular size drinks. Not an issue. When it came time to take the food order we got a kids meal and then shared the flautas appetizer. She asked if we wanted the entree that came with the rice and beans. Didn't think anything of it at the time other than she was trying to upsell but we weren't that hungry. When the bill came, everything showed up full price. When I asked about the kids eating free she then choose to mention that it was only with the purchase of an entree and we had only ordered the appetizer. I will say that after we left I did take another good look at the banner with the promotion and it did indeed have small print stating that an entree needed to be purchased. The point I want to get across, so that the manager will better train their staff in how to talk about this promotion, was the fact that she clearly was aware that we needed to purchase an entree to be eligible for the promotion but chose not to mention it at the time of ordering when she was subtly asking about getting the entree. The fact that they are normally willing to give a free kids meal, that usually costs around$5.99 with an entree, but wouldn't do it with the purchase of a $10 appetizer plus 2 bar drinks is very upsetting. I hope that the manager/owner of this location seriously rethinks how they are promoting this offer as the signage and the waitstaff are clearly not helping."}
{"text":"I agree that this place is underrated. it is in Henderson inside of a mall but don't get it twisted this place has some of the best Mexican food around. They make you fresh tortillas and I also love their chips. today we had the mix grill fajita plate and oh mahi goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly. Usually food of this cuisine tend to over cook  the seafood and steak items. A+ 

I ordered a drink but the waitress totally forgot about it and it was way to sweet. Only reason for 4 stars"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a delicious lunch here on the fun patio by 2 lovely waitpersons...a tall big chubby spanish guy and a darling red haired spanish girl...i had the shrimp fajitas, he the chicken fajita's...mine had a buttery spicy sauce to dip in and this delicious polenta  and the usual grilled onions and peppers. It was very delightful and the service was very sweet and friendly and the patio very quaint. You dont even feel like you are at the mall."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I used to love this place. Now I'm only filled with regret. Everything thing about my experience this time was a disappointment. Everthing I got was cold. Portions meant for a child. Not to mention some of the things I ordered never showed up. Food is very subpar and by subpar I mean not good at all. Service could use alot of work. All in all I don't think I will ever come back."}
{"text":"We arrived and were sat at a table, 10 minutes went by and no server came to greet us at all, we got up and moved to the bar area, we were greeted within 2 minutes, she was a little slow with getting drinks and our food took more than 20 minutes.  I did notice what I took as being the manager standing in the corner of the restaurant most of our visit. I seriously wanted to go tell him his servers in the area we were originally sat need help! He needs to manage his building instead of standing around. I took a picture of him standing around and I think he noticed because he disappeared and I never saw him for the rest of our visit"}
{"text":"today, it took forever for our waiter to just take our order, the three tables around us were seated after us and got their food before our order was even taken."}
{"text":"I've ate here several times and I have never had a bad experience. Service is good, not great, but good. The food is good for their prices, and they serve pretty good sized portions. My favorites are the fajitas, chipotle enchiladas, and the flautas. But my main reason for coming to Chevys is their micheladas, some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"My parents and I come here for the chips and salsa, and to order the queso dip as a quick snack after shopping. I love the queso dip, the salsa is always yummy and the waiters are on top of refilling the chips. 

Only complaint is the chips are too thin and stick in your teeth, and the chips were always refreshed but not the salsa as much. 
Either way we're not the most amazing customers because 2-3 times a month we mainly just order queso dip. Well occasionally get an entree. 

It's a good quick place for a snack. 
Recommended :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of corporate chains, but Chevy's always delivers.  

Their food is always fresh, homemade and delicious.  It's consistent and the prices can't be beat for all of the food you get.  Where they get you is in the alcohol.  But if you pass on that - you can have a great lunch for under $25 for two people.

The fresh hot chips and amazing salsa are to die for."}
{"text":"Delicious food, served fast and hot. Live the flautas and the grilled chicken salad with apple chipotle dressing.  Lucky patrons will be seated in Kelly or Logan's sections!"}
{"text":"My journey for delicious Mexican food has finally ended here at Chevy's.  The  food definitely remind me of the great authentic food back in Houston, Texas.
Even though it is quite a distance from where I am currently live, I will definitely make the drive to satisfy my cravings for Mexican food.  Our last visit at this place, there were 4 couples ahead of us, just waiting and waiting.  Seems like two of the couples waited for quite a while so they gave up and left.  After 5 minutes though, we got a table.  Looked like they were shortage of staff.  But o well, one man's loss is another man's gain.  I got to eat the DELICIOUS Mexican food that I have been craving for!!!

Dinner for 2
1.) Chicken Corn Chowder-a very well balanced soup where one can taste both chicken and corn.  Those two flavors work so well together...OMG!!!

2.) Mixed Grill Plate-Beef Fajitas, Shrimp, and Chicken, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, refried beans, rice, and tortillas.  Oh wait, the best thing is the...TAMALITO :) 
     -TAMALITO-The most delicious thing ever.  Go to Chevy's you must try this awesome corn flour treat.  I ordered another one of this sweet corn tamalito for desser.  It is savory and kinda sweet. Quite honestly, i could have a bowl of these babies and call it dinner!!!!

This was more than enough for 2.  We pretty much stuffed ourselves so none will go to waste!

3.) mango lemonade-yummy yummy yum yum yummy.  I always order this drink.

Food and Service: 4 Stars."}
{"text":"They don't skimp on the chips and salsa, they keep it coming. I ordered a combo with a desert. The taco, was good, the enchilada, was ok. I loved the rice and beans! That fried ice cream stuff......They can keep it. 
My husband got a combo as well, but he also got that thing called a tamale! What the heck is the mushy stuff? It was horrible! I think I will just stick to the taco rice and beans next time."}
{"text":"Kudos to Chevy's staying open on Christmas Day.  After an afternoon movie with Mom, we drove around Mesa looking for any establishment that was open.  

Chevy's, while good, is only a few steps up from eating at Taco Bell for me.  I ordered the \"Build Your Own\" combo with the cheese enchilada, chicken taco, refried beans, and rice.  Again, it was good and the price wasn't bad (about $10), but the flavors were fairly bland.  I kept adding the complementary salsa onto the meal to kick-it up a bit.  

The service was great.  The place was also kind of empty... No surprise that Chevy's isn't the place to hang on Christmas Day."}
{"text":"Sabrina is the best waitress we've ever had anywhere. Wish everyone was so accommodating...The food is great too!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, went for lunch. Quick and friendly service. Table side guacamole was fabulous. Music was a little bit to loud for the lunch time crowd but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a sat, have to say the last time I was at Chevys was up in the Bay Area with my pops about 5 years ago, so for me, it was like being there for a 1st time all over. Yes, this is a chain place, but it didn't feel like it.

1st off, ordered a grande strawberry margarita with a double shot of tequila, oh baby that was good!

Chips and salsa have hit the table and now its time to cruise the menu,  I have to say our sever, Kevin was extremely nice and professional, made sure we had everything we needed and we never had a where is our waiter moment, I love love love great customer service! Awesome job Kevin! You my dear rock!!!

Saw on the side of the menu you can soup or salad, a main entrée and a mini desert for 12 bucks, that right there was a screaming deal for my buck! So I went with it!
Ordered the tortilla soup, chicken fajitas, and fried ice cream. The tortilla soup reminded me of my mom in laws, so dang good, thought I was home for a min, the chicken fajitas, oh man what a treat, they come with fresh tortilla, I watched Kevin press them & cook them.  The mini deep fried ice cream, oh that right there was sweet heaven!!  

Good deal & good times down at Chevys!"}
{"text":"Had you asked me two past trips about this place, I would given it a \"5\" but this past two trips...bleh!  The service was slow, made several mistakes on my order and left off items off my friends plates.  One ordered two chicken tacos and got a chimichanga?!  I had the Mar Y Tierra Combo, which was very good.  I substituted the steak fajitas for chicken, and the waitress was very good about that and got that part right.  I don't like Refried beans, so I ordered the black beans...which I think may have been spoiled a bit : (  She did bring me the refried at first, I had to ask her to fix my plate, but again, one of the reasons I keep coming back is due to the great service when they are \"on.\"  
Now, that's not to say, that I won't try it again...I'm an optimist.  The service, food and atmosphere was well done before...I keep hoping they get back to that!  
I will update the next time I go.  I say give them a chance if you're in the area.  If nothing else, get a drink : )"}
{"text":"Got seated right away. Server was very nice and attentive. Food was good but the homemade guacamole wasn't as good as we had hoped."}
{"text":"Their warm wafer thin chips are the greatest, the salsa heat changes as different people make it, sometimes too hot for me. If you go in M-F 4-7, they have Happy Hour with $3 appetizers & drink specials! We usually get the steak fajita nachos which is a huge plate that my husband & I split, and both get full!"}
{"text":"A sad day for me, to say the least.  For a solid decade I've considered Chevy's to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat.  Yeah, I'm a white dude who likes the white-washed mexican...so what? its delicious!  The chips and salsa are epic!  So I'm down in Vegas visiting some friends and I suggest we hit up Chevy's for lunch, so we hit up the ONLY Chevy's around which is down at the mall in Henderson across from Sunset Station.  We walk in with 3 adults and 2 kids, both 2 years old.  So of course, they take us off the beaten path and stick us in the back corner so as not to disturb anybody....which is fine and dandy, EXCEPT WHEN THEY FORGET ABOUT YOU!   First round of drinks and chips/salsa was pushing 10 minutes from being seated.  I order an apple juice for my daughter and they're all out.  I then ask for a chocolate milk instead and...you guessed it...they're all out!  My wife asks for a side of lemons for her ice-water.  First the server says they're out, then changes his mind and says they have lemons but no limes.  Well, they never came.  Fast forward about another 45 minutes. Mind you, we've had ZERO drink refills at this point.  Out comes my plate of Chicken Fajitas...that's it.  So we're sitting and waiting another 5 or so minutes and ask where the rest of the food is.  The server apologized and said the flautas took the longest, hence the delay in delivery.  Since when does deep fried food take longer?  Well, I've finally decided I had enough and spoke to the manager.  She was super nice and ended up comping half of our bill and surrounding us with great service for the small remainder of our stay.  She even made it a point to have the server bring out lemons, so of course, he brought a side of limes.  I thought they were out of limes?  When all was said and done, it took nearly 2 hrs to eat here when it wasn't busy AND with 2 fussy toddlers.  This is easily the worst Chevy's experience I've ever had.  I'll stick to the ones in CA!!"}
{"text":"I feel like I have been visiting this Chevy's since my family first moved here about 10 years ago.

This was one of our favorite places to visit in our home town, and we were so excited there was one in Vegas for us to eat at, too. And, it was close! I have never had a disappointing experience here. My food always comes out fresh, and the waitresses are super nice. And the tortillas are AMAZING!

We visited this location the other night for a family dinner. Our waitress, whose name I didn't catch, was super sweet and checked on us constantly. She was also nice enough to let my mom and I split a combo meal, since I wasn't super hungry. 

Overall this is a great location, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"WORST Customer service ever! We waited with small children for 60 minutes at our table before we got part of our food, Getting the fajita shells and cheese to go with the fajita fixings took another 15 minutes, they were soggy and the meat was then cold. The waitress was also hostessing but the place had 3 servers at least and only about 7 tables of people. No I'm sorry or anything of the like. I would never go there again!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited over 15 minutes and nobody even acknowledged we had been seated. We we're put away from others probably because we had a toddler with us. i even went and asked for a booster seat where i seemed to interupt the hostesses doing their makeup, and still got no service from anyone. finally waited long enough left menus there and walked to red Robin where we had great service."}
{"text":"Been going to Chevys for years for a quick simple lunch/dinner. Last night was the absolute worst service. Waited over 10 minutes to bring one tasteless margarita that was already watered down. When the food arrived 20 min later, the fajitas came without tortillas, took them 5 more minutes for that. Not once did our waitress asked if the food was ok or if we needed anything else. Very poor service. Quality of food was not bad."}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good no complaints. But the last several times service has been spotty at best. 

Do you tip solely on service? 
Does service out weigh the time it takes to get your food? What if you have a good server but it takes over 30 min to get food after you order? 
This was not a place that should take that much time. #tryharder 

It has taken overly long after ordering 30 min to 40 min. Which with a 2 year old and a 4 year old can be an eternity for chicken fingers. It's crazy I know.  Also seems like they don't want you eating the chips and salsa.  I always say keep bringing them till I pass out then ever 5 min."}
{"text":"Our waiter told us our coupon worked on the sampler appetizer and it didn't. The manager gave it to us after he made us feel about 2 inches high. Watch your bill because the up-charge you on thing that you don't ask for."}
{"text":"Guacamole is made at the table half assed server is rushed and unpleasant. If  I wanted shitty guacamole I could of made it at home for alot cheaper very disappointed I will never go back and it was super expensive for shitty guacamole"}
{"text":"As for the food at Chevy's---I say *meh*.  It's not horrible but it is eminently forgettable.

We hadn't been to a Chevy's in years.  There used to be one in Sterling at the mall but it had long since closed.  We tried it once and the one thing that stuck in my mind was \"El Machino\"--- the machine that's highly visible by the entrance where you can watch an employee making tortillas.  As a result of El Machino, the tortillas are probably one of the best things about the menu.  Those same tortillas are what is used for the complimentary chips and dip.  Other than that, the rest of their food is *meh*.

We went to the one in Mesa because we were looking for a place that was kid-friendly.  Chevy's fit the bill in that case.  Yet the kids all had---hamburgers!  LOL!

I had a combo platter and chose a chile relleno and a crispy taco with carnitas.  The chile relleno was just ok---I have had far better.  As for the taco---the best part was the carnitas---I have to admit they had good flavor.

Our son-in-law had a chicken burrito and liked it.  My husband had a taste of Chevy's platter---which, well, had a taste of several menu items.  He was not impressed.

I had a frozen margarita which was just OK.   The adults at our table had a good laugh when the waitress carded me!  I'm thinking that this Chevy's got in trouble in the past for serving underage patrons.  I mean---I'm well past the legal drinking age---there's no doubt about that LOL!

Our waitress was friendly and prompt---no complaints at all about the service.

Yet---I can't help but wonder what the attraction to Chevy's is in a place where there is far better Mexican food around...?"}
{"text":"Ack, a trip to the mall at the opposite end of town from where I live.  Ok, here we go.

At first we were supposed to eat at Red Robin which was crazy busy.  The \"Two Kids Eat Free w/One Adult Entree\" caught my eye at this place and goody goody, there was no line.  It was a beautiful 70 degrees outside so we decided to eat on their patio.  I love to dine outside.  It's a little luxury of mine and makes feel like l'm in a cafe in a foreign country.  We were seated within 5 minutes.  The patio was nicely decorated with plants, vines and flowers.  We had little finches hopping around here and there.  

The food was good, not great, but good.  The chips and salsa, however, were excellent.  I think the salsa was my favorite part of my entire meal.  (Good salsa is hard to come by.)  I believe they must roast their tomatoes because it had that smokey flavor to it and some charred pieces.  

We ordered:
The Laredo--soft/crunchy chicken taco, chicken tamale, chicken enchilada, beef enchilada.  (I went with the soft chicken taco.)  It came with a side of some sweet corn ball of something (I can't remember what it's called, obviously).  Everything was ok.  I enjoyed the soft chicken taco best.
Nachos (5 pieces)--half chicken and half steak.  Hubby and kid liked it.
Kids meal--one crunchy and one soft chicken taco with a side of grilled veggies and fresh fruit.  The kids preferred the soft taco and ate all their veggies and fruit.

The kid's meal comes with desert, ice cream or jello.  I had a taste of the ice cream and wished my meal came with it.  (Does being a kid at heart count?)  The cone was like a deep fried tortilla or something with cinnamon sprinkled on it topped with vanilla.  I usually don't care for vanilla (a bit too boring/bland for my taste).  But they put magic into this one!  It was so good.

The kids meal options also had beans and cheese burritos, hamburgers and chicken fingers, I think, with your choice of 2 sides (fresh fruit, grilled veggies, french fries, and that sweet corn thingy).

And true to their word, the kids ate for free.  

I would definitely come back here when I venture down to this mall, if not to eat a meal, then at least for the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Dawn C. and I stop in here sometimes after doing a little shopping at Galleria Mall. I love the $3 tableside guacamole on Sundays. 

Monday-Friday they have happy hour 3 to 7 with $3 drinks and some appetizers are half off. You have to sit in the bar for that but no biggie. 

Entrees are not the most authentic Mexican grub you will find in Las Vegas but it is inexpensive and tasty."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff is seriously rude!!

  At the end of our meal I paid for my food n my friend paid for hers. The guy that was serving us accused my friend of not having any money on her card. This caused embarrassment on her part n she had to call her bank I ended up using my card to pay for her food anyway.  The bank  told her the money was already taken out.   

When we told our server, he said he was going to get his manager which is this overweight Mexican guy. We ended up paying twice for her meal, n wanted a refund back on my card. While my friend was talking to me bout  my refund , the  rude manager cut in, gave her the dirtiest look, n said \" CAN I TALK OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO CUT ME OFF??\" umm excuse me?  You don't talk to customers like that.

 To cut this story, I never got the refund on my card, we're neverrr going back to that chevys,  they need to hire people that know how to swipe a damn debit card, n I also heard from another friend of mine that she had a run in with the exact . Same. Manager at this restaurant n she wasn't treated kindly either!  

I guess they only treat certain kind of people nice in here.  Oh well. I'm usually a big tipper when I go out to eat cause I know customer service is hard, but I left leaving no tip, n my friend was very unhappy with the treatment ."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! I was so impressed with this place! The food is dynamite! Excellent lil extras also! They have a lil pineapple mango addition on the plates that's so yummy!! Also a lil cornbread deal that is excellent! The manager Ben and his staff was so kind helpful and happy! A gentleman chad also came by to see how we liked our dinner and I told him we were in love with their place! He offered so much info brought us a lil extra of some items we loved just an incredible happy experience! Definitely our new to go to place!!!!! For sure have the ckn flautas!!!!!"}
{"text":"So this Chevy's on this day has been most enjoyable.  We were greeted, and seated within moments of entering the establishment. Our chips  and mild house salsa arrived immediately.  Server took out order and drinks arrived quickly.  Replaced salsa without is having to ask.  Music is not too loud and of tasteful selection. Menu has many items and combinations to choose from all reasonably priced.  Ice tea fresh brewed and delicious.   Meal was served as ordered no problems! Had a great lunch!!"}
{"text":"I guess I don't know what I should have expected.  I had gone to a Chevy's once many many years ago, but couldn't remember how it was.  We were at the mall and decided to give it a shot.

When we walked in, the hostess was very nice and sat us.  After that, it was pretty much downhill.  The waiter wasn't very friendly and somewhat short with us.  He didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  The salsa that was brought out to us looked like it had been prepackaged, sitting around and was in the shape of some other bowl.  It didn't taste much better either.

I ordered the grilled chicken tacos.  The beans were alright, as was the rice.  The taco was dry and bland in some areas, except in the center, where the dab of sauce was.  It only made it taste like a chicken ranchero taco from Taco Bell.  Not something I'd want again.

It's not authentic at all, which is fine, but make it taste good.  I will not go back again."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Sat at our table for an hour waiting for our order. Ended up getting up and leaving. The manager didnt even apologize when I told him we were leaving. I handed him a $5 bill for the softdrinks I had ordered... I was surprised he actually took the money! It was an opportunity for him to make it up to an unsatisfied customer and he dropped the ball. Too bad because I really like their shrimp fajitas! I definitely will not go back and will make sure everyone I know does not go there!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon for appetizers and margaritas. The food was great, the margaritas were expensive but yummy. Our waiter was very fast and friendly! And best of all, free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"A great place for some quick and easy Mexican food while in the galleria area. Definitely, not the best Mexican but it very tasty and closer to Tex -mex opposed to the Baja-mex style. 

The crab and shrimp enchiladas are yummy and the queso is tasty! The salsa is not spicy more along the lines of pico de gallo."}
{"text":"absolutely in love with their crab and shrimp enchilada, creamy and spicy! their salsa and chips are very good as well. I also had their mango lemonade which was more sweet than... sour lemonade tasting. Which isn't a bad thing to me."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a chain, but so what, no need to be a snob. The chips and salsa are some of the best I have ever had. Anything off of the grill is very good as well. Join their loyalty program and get all kinds of offers including a free  entry on your birthday! I just had free nachos! How about that! So stop in and enjoy. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"My husband and I sometimes eat here if we're out running errands and craving Mexican food. It's a convenient location for us. 

I really like the crab and shrimp enchiladas, mostly because of the tasty habanero pesto sauce that comes on top. The chips and salsa are really good. The steak fajitas are good because the meat is very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken tacos because the chicken is pretty dry and flavorless. 

The last time we had lunch here the service was ridiculously slow. It did seem to be just our waiter because tables with other servers were getting food and attention. I also find that the servers consistently push the alcoholic drinks to the point of being annoying. On one visit I decided in the car on the way that I would get a margarita, but the server was so ridiculous in her margarita pitch that I had to go with water. I didn't want her to think that being obnoxious wins. Since the alcohol pitch has been so intense among several waiters on several different occasions I can only assume that this is part of the training. A tip I learned in one of my professional sales classes in college- people want to buy things, but they don't want to be sold to."}
{"text":"CLOSED. 

Too bad, I usually like Chevy's but this one seemed a step below those found upstate (of which only one remains, unfortunately). I don't usually lament the loss of a semi-national chain franchise, but Chevy's is getting harder and harder to find around here and IMO they're one of the few chain restaurants worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is a corporate, run-of-the-mill, family tex-mex restaurant. But sometimes the experience makes the stars. 

I was running around, with my 3 month old in the mall, having a pretty hectic day. So I stopped in for a quick bite to eat. All I had was chips and guacamole (two orders actually) and a margarita to calm my nerves. Now the margarita was mostly sugar so 3 stars at best and the guacamole wasn't too bad, but when the diaper needed changing and the baby needed feeding, the server was cool. After changing, I returned to a table of fresh chips and full water. Baby needed feeding, so he grabbed some hot water with a smile. I think I just got that genuine happiness that is tough to come by in restaurants, especially a customer with a stroller and a baby. So, because of the great attitude I got I had to give this place a five star rating."}
{"text":"I should say up front that this review is based on chips, salsa, and a strawberry frozen margarita.  But you know, I feel like chips/salsa/margz are the fundamental building blocks of any Mexican restaurant, and if they fail at those, they might fail at other things.

When my friend and I drove down for homecoming, we arrived a little early and couldn't check into the hotel yet.  Chevys was just down the street, so we decided kick off our weekend of constant food and alcohol consumption by getting some drinks at the bar.  At 5 pm on a Friday night, the place was amusingly empty, with the occasional random quiet man alone at the bar drinking margaritas (awkward) and a couple other tables of folks in Illini gear (and Steelers gear, for some odd reason.  They followed me here?)

We saw that on Fridays they have a $4 frozen strawberry margarita special.  That deal was calling our name, so we each got one.  They were all right - good texture, decent taste, we got a little buzzed, but nothing special.  The chips and salsa, however, were totally blargh!  Watery salsa, weirdly textured chips - like, the chips were really weak and flimsy, not the good sturdy tortilla chips that can hold up to good salsa.  They weren't even worth eating.  Also, the bartender was visibly perturbed when we asked for the check.  Sorry, but we had dinner plans at Papa Del's, and didn't want to spoil our appetite!

....why go here when you could drive a mile and go to Dos Reales?"}
{"text":"The place was fun.  My fajitas were hotter than ever and I have ordered fajitas at different Chevys over 1000 times.  Our server was so nice - our server was really nice he says he's only been there a month I forgot to get his name"}
{"text":"We came for my friend's free birthday entree.  She had a printed coupon from the internet.  We sat in the Cantina so my other friend and I could order from the Happy Hour menu.

We ordered my favorite Original Fajita Nachos and tried the Crispy Chicken Flauta Rolls.  My friend really liked the Crispy Flauta Rolls.  They were crisp and flaky served with a jalapeño jelly.  I just wish we had asked for the appetizers to come about 10-15 minutes apart.

My friend wore the traditional birthday sombrero and had \"Happy Birthday\" sung to her by the staff and got a complimentary scoop of vanilla ice cream in a fried cinnamon tortilla bowl.

We will be back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Been to this location three times and haven't had any significant problems so far. Chevy's has the best chips and salsa i've ever tasted and the food is delicious. Only complaint is that the restrooms don't have sensored towel dispensers. Not cool man."}
{"text":"There's a big rift in my circle of friends between the Chevys people and the Dos Reales people.  I have to say that I land firmly on the Chevys side, because I am never -- never -- disappointed with what I get here.

All the way through, Chevys is a delicious meal.  Frankly, I'm frequently too full to do anything more than nibble on my entree, because the chips and salsa are to die for -- I've never had anything quite like it.  The salsa is absolutely delicious, tastes like there's a little bit extra black pepper in it.

The entrees are great.  I usually get a pick-4 or pick-5 combo -- leaves me with leftovers so I can have lunch the next day.  Anything's good, but in particular, I want to recommend the flautas.  They're not traditional (when eaten with the sauce they come with, the term \"Mexican egg roll\" comes to mind), but they are, I think, the tastiest item on the menu.

Also, make sure you get the yellow corn stuff.  I'm not sure what it's called, but when eaten at the end of your meal, it's unbeatable.

The only downside I see to Chevys is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  I'm from Chicago, where Mexican food is cheap, and even though this isn't quite the same thing as the Burrito house, I find it odd to be paying as much as I do for this kind of food.  It's not a budget-buster or anything -- food+tax+tip usually comes out to about $17-18 for me -- but it's a bit pricier than most college town fare.

But, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Came here to meet my daughter for dinner and wow was the food good.  I have been here before and never has it made an impression like it did yesterday.  I noticed that the tortillas & tamales are homemade which is a HUGE deal in my opinion.  I ordered the guacamole appetizer which they make right in front of you and it is very flavorful and fresh.  I then ordered the farm fresh enchiladas which is a vegetarian enchilada with mushrooms and artichokes filled with cheese and covered in jalapeno cream sauce that was unbelievable good.  I loved this dish and the beans were also fantastic.  I have to say that I will be back for this dish alone.  The atmosphere is casual but clean and decorated in the theme.  Service was great and the margaritas were $3 each so I splurged as well."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ!

Great atmosphere, laid back, great prices, and GREAT happy hour deals in the Cantina!

Every time I come to Phoenix, my friend and I always schedule a night out at Chevy's!  Even with the loss of a location, we still go out of our way to make time to eat there.

Candace or Caitlin are the best waitresses there...friendly, quick, and they even get my order right every time!!!"}
{"text":"WOW, for a happy hour this place is amazing.  From 3pm to 7pm, you would think, THIS PLACE REALLY????

The staff in the bar area are amazing.  The level of customer service you get from them makes you feel like you are in a 5 STAR restaurant.  The drinks, the appetizers are so good and reasonable for the price they charge, you will not find a better place in the valley then this place.

We have been here a few times to eat without enjoying the happy hour and the food was good.  We only had one bad experience with a manager there when we wanted to order something we were paying for and asking for it to be made the way we desired.  

I would HIGHLY recommend this place for anytime, but if you have the opportunity to come here for Happy Hour, take advantage of the opportunity and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow. So i know i JUST raved about the best bar service i'd gotten in a while (or ever in vegas), but believe it or not, chevy's just topped it! We went in (my first time by the way) to watch the first half of the basketball game and Marcus was our bartender and he was great! He chatted with us about the game, was friendly, attentive, funny, and rooted for us to win our parlay (which we didn't :( blast!) 

The dos equis was cold, the chips and salsa were bottomless, and the chicken quesadilla was good. But honestly, we'll be back for the service."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped for lunch; food was great, our server Venancio was very attentive and friendly, service was fast did not have to wait long, ambiance, very relaxed and friendly.  Manager visited our table which we appreciated.  Will definitely be back!, food and service have improved greatly. DK"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here today! Our server was great and went out of his way to make my boyfriends salsa extra spicy by cutting up jalapeños and adding them to the salsa! 

I ordered the 4 item combo with chicken tamale, beef taco and chicken flautas! The jalapeño jelly for the flautas is amazing! My boyfriend had carnitas fajitas and loved them. Good flavor! Also had a half piña colada half daqarui drink and it was really good."}
{"text":"I was pleased with the food. Good drinks and friendly service."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, surprisingly consistent fresh Mex / American. Good lunch specials. Friendly service. Yes, it is a chain but a fairly decent one. The corn cake as well as the Fried Ice Cream are definite guilty pleasures."}
{"text":"I usually like Chevys. I took family there telling them it was good. All of our food was cold and wAy over seasoned. We were very disappointed. We will not patron this Chevys again. The service was good the food was almost inedible and took forever to be prepared."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have enjoyed the experience every time. The food was great and their margaritas are even better. Anthony was our server, he was very professional and on top of everything. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Our server was sweet, but the food was terrible.  We were shopping in the area, craving Mexican and the reviews at least looked decent enough that we thought we would be satisfied. Restaurant felt dirty, food was way overpriced and easily considered one of the worst meals we have had in Henderson. Not sure if it is a fluke but we won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Business is closed as of the end of November 2011.  The only other ones I know of are the one near Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and maybe the one that was in Bloomington, Il."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  Its lent so no meat of Fridays, so had to go with fish.....shrimp burritos sounded good.  Originally was going to go to Wahoo's but we wanted some Margaritas with lunch and Chevy's has great margaritas.  Should have went to Wahoo's.  Its lunch time and was not that busy at all.  We sat out on the patio, and the service was SLOW.  No silverware, took awhile to get our drinks.  I ordered a shrimp burrito....my food comes out..I get shrimp tacos.  Waitress asks if I wanted it taken back which normally I would have but we were starting to run out of time( had to be somewhere at 200).  The people we were with came a lil later than us and it took a long time for them to get chips and salsa, and their appetizer order came way late as well.  So I get the bill and was charged full price for what I didn't order. Normally I would ask for a manager or something but now it's getting danger close to being late for my 2 pm thing i gotta be at.  The food was good but the service made the meal not so great.   Also here is a free tip.  When you order a margarita order the small.  I had a large and it was 11.99 I didn't want to get blasted but wanted another so I ordered a small one for my second.  I emptied the ice out of the empty large one and dumped the small one in the large glass and it was almost the same amount (probably less than 2 oz).  Shame on you Chevy's you just lost a customer I hate shady stuff like this from a so called reputable chain establishment.  Should have went to Wahoo's!!"}
{"text":"I came here again and for some reason I thought it would be a nice place to take my wife's parents. Big mistake. The service was better than usual, but the food was worse than ever. It seemed like everything we ate was just old, somehow. The best thing anyone ate was the free chips and salsa before the meal.

This will probably be my final visit."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area over the weekend and was looking for my favorite hot wings.  Luckily Chevy's is owned by the same company that owns Acapulco's and El Torito Restaurants which are my favorite in California.  

This place was just as great!  The hot wngs were delish...the margaritas were also.  They have happy hour from 2p-8p 7 days a week!  I went on Saturday afternoon for lunch and went back for dinner...awesome!"}
{"text":"If it were not for the chips and salsa, I would never return to this restaurant. I have been going there since I was a kid. In the past year or so, the service has gotten so bad, I wouldn't even believe it is the same restaurant. I only get carry out now, and that is only when I am craving the chips and salsa. 

Even their carry out food service is terrible, unfortunately. My past 4 visits, I have called over 30-45 minutes in advance to my order, and upon arrival nobody has prepared it. During one visit (The Friday before 2012 Superbowl), it took me 45 minutes AFTER I arrived for them to get me 2 bags of chips and 2 portions of salsa. Another woman had been waiting there longer than me. We were both waiting on chips and salsa ONLY. That should never happen.

My last visit was 3/3/12 and again, I called 35 minutes before arriving to order chips and salsa for a party. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before being greeted. The hostess then went to \"find out\" who took my order and returned and told me I had to go to the cantina/bar to pay and get them. Once I got in there, I stood for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone walking by so I could get my order. Finally a man brought it to me. I was so fed up. I do not think I can return. I am sick of being treated like they don't need or even WANT my business.

I have never received an apology from any of them for taking so long, and not having my order ready, even when I gave them plenty of notice AND the orders were simple."}
{"text":"Lucky me it was happy hour when I arrived at Galleria Mall!! I could use a pre-shopping drink & a snack. Sat at the bar and ordered my favorite fresh fruit strawberry margarita & taquitos. I love the chips & salsa they bring over for you to munch on while you wait. I was going to be a good girl and only have one drink..since they are huge..but the bartender was sweet enough to hook me up with one free. That gets 5 stars! I went about my shopping in a much happier mood thats for sure!!"}
{"text":"Lacking customer service and the kids menu, is quite sad. 
Bar service was very good, but the time I went there were only 3 people, so as expected. 
I have gone several times because of the location. Every time is just average. When you get the bill and say really? It's not the best dining experience."}
{"text":"This \"Mexican\" dining experience is the least authentic I've ever had.

The crispy chicken flautas tasted like convenience store 'taquitos'.

Their quesadillas had great tortillas that were admittedly tasty, but the cheese was questionable. Other Yelpers have pointed out it tastes like Velveeeta, which I'm not down for in a sit-down establishment like this.

The chimichanga is the worst I've ever had. The beans are too sweet, and don't even taste like they should be used for Mexican food. I tried to douse a portion with the habanero sauce at the table, but that was even sweeter. It was...gross, to sum it up in nice terms.

Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE this place, it's just really lame food for such a great location, decor, and the friendly staff. The tequila menu is pretty legit, so I might swing by again while I'm shopping."}
{"text":"The food here its amazing. Large amounts of food and great quality. Every single bite had an amazing  taste. Very pleased and very happy with the food. Also our server \"Cesar\" made sure that we were set and that we had everything we needed , i hope on our next visit we hear from the management  that Cesar was recognized  for his good work with the costumers. He has great costumer  service, i don't  often see this type of costumer  service so it pleased me to have experienced here. Definitely  will come back soon. Loved this place."}
{"text":"We came here b/c we had a desire to try something new (to us) and we'd never been to Chevy's, close to the house and we had a $5 off coupon from that book you buy for $30. Only $25 left toward making our cash bk from that awesome little deal! 
I went with the Fresh Mex Artichoke Mushroom enchiladas. and I secretly think to myself wow for someone from West TX who loves meat and would really like a shirt like Jessica Simpson's that says \"Real Women eat meat\" .. I havent been eating meat all that often lately. hmmm. strange. But I also love anything that has poblano & mushroom and artichoke. hmm. win win win. 
I loved it. i was expecting a crappy kind of enchilada but it was actually kinda good. and knowing I was only paying $4.99 b/c of the coupon made it taste just a lil better! The chips here are very thin which I like the salsa is good but a lil to much chunky onions in the salsa. 
I'd def. order this again and picture is posted online with my check in here from last night. 
My bf ordered the taste of Chevy's and he said that I won last night (aka who got the better tasting meal) Nuff said. 
I did however taste a lil bite of the enchiladas and the tamales (offered but not asked for.. he's so precious...) and the tamale was GOOD. everything else was just ok. 
Bottom line, I really liked this dish till I looked up the calories which werent listed on my calorie count application on my phone (android) damn. this was 1120! damn. Good think I dint eat all of it! 
I would have def. ordered this again. or would order it again and just eat half. Very good."}
{"text":"Went to Chevys at 7:40 Sunday night. They had the door locked. We weren't intentionality going right before closing. Just hungry. An employee said they were slow so the closed early :("}
{"text":"Best fajitas in town! Definitely not average mall food.  Great fresh Mexican food.  Many good servers.  Not all but several are very good."}
{"text":"What can I say...foodwise, Chevys is Chevys. I was with my 6 year old and she was so well behaved, never even got up from her seat. The food came out quick then our waiter disappeared. 20 mins after we're done I saw him an asked for the bill...another 20 mins.  My daughter was getting anxious but asked, why don't you just ask someone else for the payment (she calls that the bill). Horrible horrible service. There were only 4 tables on the patio, not close to being busy."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy Chevy's - especially their chips and salsa!  (And their margaritas were pretty delicious as well!) 

We called ahead to find out what time happy hour ended and they said 7 pm.  So we bolted to the mall and took a seat at one of the high bar tables.

With two bartenders and it not being busy on a Monday night, it took awhile for us to get any attention - no menus, no water, no acknowledgment. 

When we were finally noticed, we asked what the happy hour menu was and he pointed to a flip menu (that the Husband had already grabbed from another table).  It didn't really have the details, so I helped myself to a regular menu.  He then made us feel so rushed putting our order in, especially if we wanted it during the happy hour time.  

After we put our order in, the chips and salsa finally arrived.

* Crispy Chicken Flauntas \"Original Salsa Chicken, roasted red peppers, grilled corn and cheeses lightly crisped in flour tortilla.  Served with grilled pineapple salsa and our signature jalapeno jelly.\" - This was actually pretty disappointing.  I asked for sour cream, and got charged for it.  (They should really let you know.)

* Spicy Wings \"Fuego-seasoned chicken wings basted in our smoky BBQ sauce served with ranch dressing.\" - Again, this was just okay as well.  The Husband definitely has had his share of better wings.

Meanwhile, our chips and salsa had been empty and no one offered to refill it.  Even a manager came by our table and asked how everything was and we said fine.  She didn't even notice that we were lacking chips and salsa.  (Obviously she came by out of habit, but really doesn't pay attention to her customers' needs.)  We also had to ask for refills on water.

And sadly, their chips and salsa aren't even great anymore.  I'm actually preferring Chili's version right now.

Overall, our bartender/waiter was just not good.  He didn't pay any attention to us despite us sitting so close to the bar.  We did notice another table of two getting a lot better customer service from a different bartender/waiter.  He checked on their table often, unlike ours.

It was just not a good experience and the food was just okay.  We probably are in no rush to go back any time soon.

{"text":"One of the better Chevys I have been to. Was hard to find, as it is in the Galleria mall, and due to construction, there is currently no outside signage to lead you to their entrance.
We went during lunch service. Our server was friendly, attentive, with a touch of humor. LIked that.
We had the chicken and the steak fajitas, both cooked to perfection. Food was served hot as were the sides. 
No complaints here, we enjoyed our meal and margaritas. We left with full tummies and smiling faces!"}
{"text":"Hmmm . . . The quality seems to be diminishing at Chevy's.  Can't exactly describe it, but the \"Fresh Mex\" just hasn't seemed as fresh lately.  Too bad, as they used to be terrific.  Hard to describe what exactly it was.  Seemed like the beans were a little older, like they'd been overnight in the fridge.  The meat was a little drier and bouncier than it used to be.  The food just didn't taste as . . . well . . .. \"fresh\" as it used to.

Even their formerly amazing salsa had a bitter aftertaste that it didn't used to have.

Worst of all, last two times we stopped in they'd stopped making watermelon margaritas for the season.  

They're still pretty good, but we really hope they'll get back to the food quality they had last spring.  Chevy's used to be one of our favorite feeds, but if Chevy's doesn't  get their act together pretty quick we may have to give up on 'em and move on."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican food.  Plain old delicious, refried-beany, flavorful, familiar Mexican food.  I wanted to go to Dos, but my boyfriend wanted to go to Chevy's.  In the end, I finally caved and made my first visit to the latter.

The chips and salsa were great (we ended up eating two baskets worth).  I ordered the flautas, my usual.  I was wary when I read that they came drizzled with mango habanero salsa and jalapeño jelly.  What the fuck?  I ordered flautas, not a bloody fruit salad.  I wanted sour cream!  Guac!  Pico de gallo and shredded lettuce!  I struggled to put my biases aside, but sure enough, I found the salsa and jelly too sweet for my taste - the whole thing really could have used some more spice.  And the tortillas the flautas were wrapped in were strangely flakey; Gavin D. aptly describes it as a \"Mexican egg roll,\" which was good, but not really what I wanted.

Let me put it this way: let's say you're craving Kraft Mac 'n Cheese.  CRAVING it.  You NEED it.  And then you go to your friend's house and your friend's mom promises you a delicious mac 'n cheese dinner, so you get all excited.  When you sit down to the table, you are dismayed to find that this isn't regular mac 'n cheese at all: it's some scary brand and she's added capers and sauteed mushrooms and parsley in an attempt to fancy it up.  I mean, sure, it's okay, but ALL YOU WANTED WAS KRAFT.

Three stars, though, because the service was friendly and fast, the chips and salsa were a win, and the sweet corn tamalito that came with my meal was great."}
{"text":"Took the family here for dad's 71st birthday. It was very good went on a Tuesday so the kids are free. We had a fun and relaxed time. Everything was really good we had steak fajitas, chicken fajitas and a taco salad. The kids had Mac & cheese plus dessert comes with. They sang dad happy birthday brought him dessert and the gave him a sombrero as a gift. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was out shopping with a girlfriend and decided to stop by and have a margarita. We asked the waitress how much the top shelf margaritas were and the waitress said they are $10.00 but we have a special where you get 2 of them and a free order of nachos grande. So, we said sure. That sounds like a great deal. We'll do that. Well, the bill came and it was $36.00 including tax. We called the waitress over and told her we were confused. She apologized for the misunderstanding stating that she had neglected to tell us the margaritas that came with the special are the larger size margaritas and they are more expensive. I told her there is no way we were going to pay $16.50 a piece for a margarita even if it did come with a free nachos grande. Had we known the drinks were so expensive, we never would have ordered the special. We weren't going to eat in the first place and the only reason we did it is because it was a great deal. The waitress sent the  manager, Santiago over and we explained what happened and he said \"sorry I can't do anything about it.\" He basically told us we ordered what we ordered and even if there was a misunderstands we needed to pay for it. After he argued with us for a few more minutes, he agreed to take $11.00 off of our bill. That was all he was willing to take off.  It was unbelievable given that we had misunderstood the price of what we ordered   because the waitress had told us the wrong price and the for the manager to argue with us, made it even more unbelievable. Santiago was a total jerk and acted as if we  were trying to get something for nothing. I will never go to that Chevys again and I will also tell my friends about my experience and urge them not go there."}
{"text":"Talk about a Mexican Fiesta!  This was a great place to quench our thirst after a couple of hours of shopping.  That's exactly what we did yesterday.  

The place is located in the Galleria mall, although there is an entrance/exit and outside seating that could be accessed independently and not by going into the mall first.  

When we entered to get seated, we asked the first desk representative if they had a happy hour and she said only on Tuesdays.  C'MON!  They gotta step up their game.  Who has a happy hour ONLY on one day a week.  That's no bueno, but definitely didn't stop us.  

The place was literally a Mexican cantina.  Bright colors everywhere, wood finishes, sombreros, and other Latin decor.  I felt as if we were taken to the streets of Cabo San Lucas.  Our server was very nice, but was super slow.  Didn't necessarily drink our table right away, but did bring a lot of chips and salsa throughout our visit, which made up for it.  

Today we got a couple of rounds of Coronas, Cadillac Marguaritas and a plate of the Original Fajita Nachos.  They all came to about $37 minus the tip.  The Coronas obviously tasted like Coronas and although I didn't try the Margs, it looked really refreshing.  The Fajita Nachos were bomb!  Each chip came with chicken (you can always choose steak instead) and melted jack cheese.  There was about 20-25 topped chips around a huge platter.  In the middle of the platter there was guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and a few slices of jalapenos. The combination was great.  The chicken was seasoned nicely and I loved how they prepared each chip and made them ready for the other toppings.  Super convenient and very flavorful

Definitely a place you've got to visit at one point.  The food is good and the service is good.  After a day of shopping, come by and check these guys out."}
{"text":"Great guacamole and salsa. The tacos were great. So much better than La fiesta. Fast and Friendly service. They also have a tortilla maker as well. Pretty neat."}
{"text":"They accommodated our very large group when chillis wouldn't, they were decent with refills of drinks and chips for such a large group (almost 20). There was over a 50 minute time spread between the first meal served to our group and the last. But the reason for 2 stars was the extremely meager portion sizes. My 2 enchilada meal for $11 consisted of 2 hot dog size enchiladas, and beans with rice. Literally pennies worth of food. You can easily get twice the food elsewhere for half the money. The personnel at the store were nice though."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5 stars.

Service was prompt and friendly. Water delivered with no straws, had to ask. Son's water glass had stains on the inside. Sat on the patio.

I had a chicken fajita burrito. It came with rice, and black beans. The burrito was bland, The chicken was grilled and cubed but not much flavor. There were also pinto beans and cheese in it but none of the ingredients were hot enough to fully melt the cheese so it was just kind of warm. The black beans were good, the rice...meh. 

Other dishes ordered were steak tacos that were good (4 stars) and a quesadilla appetizer which was just \"ok\". Both my kids told me that my own homemade quesadillas are much better. 


Probably won't be back not because it's bad, mainly because I have limited opportunities to dine out and I don't want to experience mediocrity when I do get the time to go out."}
{"text":"I have always loved Chevy's, they have THE BEST fresh tortillas! I usually order the Chicken Fajitas and have never been disappointed. This location is no different. I sat in the bar today and had great service during a busy Saturday lunch. I live over in Summerlin so this isn't the most convenient location, but it's the only one in the valley and it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I am reading the reviews and surprised at some of them. I have been going here for about 2 years and really like it. A big plus is that it is in the mall. The food always tastes fresh and I was told they make mostly from scratch, which is a plus for me. I love the guacamole they make it at your table for you. The salsa and chips are so good, the best I have honestly tried in a restaurant. You can get them to go for around 8.00 for a huge bag and probably at least a pint of salsa. I always order the soup and guac. My hubby has had many things on the menu and always is satisfied. This is the only mexican restaurant my son goes to, he loves it."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend a couple weeks ago, and enjoyed the whole experience.  The weather was still warm enough that we could sit outside comfortably, and the lights on the patio as the sun went down made for a wonderful eating atmosphere.  The food was delicious - most especially the tableside guac we ordered.  I had a small amount left over that I took home with me and enjoyed later.  I couldn't waste even a spoonful!  ; )  I come to the Galleria Mall most often of all the Vegas malls, so I'll think of Chevy's next time I'm there and am in the mood for Mexican!"}
{"text":"The best margaritas in town. I love the watermelon margarita the best but they only have it when in season. The salsa is really good too.  I am so disappointed they have closed at the Arrowhead Mall. I hope they relocate somewhere in AZ."}
{"text":"Food was good. Nothing special. On the same level as chilis. We were at the mall so figured we'd eat. Expectations were low because we didn't plan on an exceptional meal, but the food met expectations. The service was awesome and timely."}
{"text":"It's always a good meal at Chevy's.  Don't let this mall restaurant fool you, it is good Mexican food!  From the time that they drop their delicious chips and salsa at your table to the moment you get your fajitas with homemade flour tortillas, you will not be disappointed.  The only reason I am giving four stars is because my steak fajita meat was a little chewy.  It could've been the cut of meat they used, but it wasn't a deal breaker.  I have to say that this restaurant is not afraid to season the food and that is what makes them so good!!"}
{"text":"I think Chevy's is undergoing a revamp. New menu's, new menu items, etc. Thankfully they didn't touch their chips and salsa which I am such a fan of.
The food was much better than the last time I was there. And the prices haven't changed much. I got my usual 2 item combo with a Crispy Chicken Taco and Chicken Flautas. Doug got the Steak Fajitas. Both of our entrees were delicious. Our cute waitress was friendly and helpful. The manager was sure to greet us as well and ensure we were having a good experience.
I belong to their birthday club, so I had a coupon for a free entree. After our meal they surprised me with a song, yummy dessert sundae, and an awesome sombrero. I could feel myself blush but it was great, I haven't had a birthday song in a restaurant for years."}
{"text":"I don't care that this is a chain. They have, hands down, the best chips and salsa I've had at any Mexican restaurant. I would love to buy a tub of that salsa. All of the menu items I've tried there have been amazing. I usually go for the enchiladas, but I've been super impressed by the fajitas, and most recently, a vegetable quesadilla that was parmesan encrusted - somewhat odd sounding, but soooo good. It's always friendly service, and they're very accommodating. The prices are good as well."}
{"text":"Chimi had ground beef instead of shredded beef, crab quesadilla had no flavor, corn and Mac and cheese floating at the bottom of my water glass.  Told manager and he wanted to argue about how the beef was high quality and tastes good.  no apology, no offer to compensate, nothing.  Came here for my birthday dinner, crappy way to end my day."}
{"text":"This is about our 3rd time here. Service is pretty consistent--not really good or bad just ok. Today we used a bday coupon worth up to $12. We ordered: 3 item combo of: mini chimichanga, chicken tamale and cheese enchilada--the 5 item special (which included a chili relleno), and a kids quesadilla....drink was .99 extra (booooo).  Chips and salsa were pretty good, but we had to ask for the warm tortillas. Drinks were just water because they don't have fresca (another boo).  Beans and rice were not good at all....rice was hard and beans were too pastey.  The scoop of corn tomalito was so small. Since we had the coupon price was decent at $25 and we tipped bases on full check but if we had to pay full price we Prob wouldn't be back. Food was just not really that good.....:-/"}
{"text":"After waiting for 48 minutes for our food, the rice was mush, and the fajitas that cost 17.49 were very sad. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just came thru for a quick bite on Mother's Day! Just getting started, I'll finish later, got food n drinks to tend to! Sat in the bar section as we figured the evening rush would get there shortly. Mamacita and I had the appetizer sampler n a few grilled chx soft tacos to end the Evening and \"keep it simple stupid\"!! The service was cool, strawberry Rita' for me n peach for her. Food arrived promptly as did the child n salsa. Sorry for the lighting in the pics, I know it's kinda dark..I've read several negative reviews but I haven't been disappointed here. The sampler consisted of; flautas, wings, quesadilla, n tostada w chicken n cheese.. I was a fan of all except the wings were kinda KC masterpiece'ish, with the sauce.. Not feeling them too much but everything else was on point. Crisp tostada, the dipping sauce for the flautas was tangy with a lil kick of jalapeño.. The grilled chx tacos we ordered ala carte ( no need for beans n rice tonight).. The customer service was great and we enjoyed the meal along with drinks! Job well done on Mother's Day, just keeping it simple! Jesus no room for dessert!! I'm stuffed... The happy hour specials r cool too, Sunday is a good day to roll through here if in the area. Chips n salsa r always on constant refill!"}
{"text":"Yes, you see it correctly, I just gave Chevy's 5 stars.... Why you ask? Well when i lived in Cali we would meet our friends at Chevy's for the awesome happy hour and have some great margaritas. Since coming to Vegas I thought that there was not any Chevys around anywhere. 
We ventured over to the mall and guess what I spy?!?!?! CHEVY'S. 

I think they have great salsa and I really like the nachos.. I am in no way saying that this is \"real\" Mexican food but it was good and cheap. If I really think about it I am giving this place stars just like how you would give your friends that you have not seen in a long time a high five long before you ask how life has been treating them. So in all reality the food could have been so-so but it was all about the reminiscing.

Anyone want to go get a Margarita... Count me in!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Chevy's.  Their chips and salsa and the best.  The chips are warm and thin and the salsa is fire roasted.  The entrees are tasty as well but I could easily make a full meal out of the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite mexican style restaurant in Vegas.  Hot fresh chips and good salsa really sets the tone for me and theirs is great!  I have to stop myself from getting full before the real food comes.   Seafood Enchiladas are the best!  everything else has been good too.  Fajitas are great and Margaritas are huge and delicious!  The only negative was the table side guacamole which was very very bland.  It's possible that it was just a new person making it and they didn't do a very good job.  But love going here!"}
{"text":"Well, we started off on the wrong foot. The hostess took us to a dirty table. It's not a big deal but the server should have inspected the area priory to giving the hostess the \"green light\". 

We were given chips and salsa immediately after we were sat but we had to wait for the table to be cleaned. 

I brought 3 children with me and at one point one of my children had a chip go down the \"wrong pipe\". This was bad timing because we had not been given our liquids by our server. My wife had to get up and get a glass of water from the server. 

I know it's a weekday but the quality of service has gone down significantly."}
{"text":"Considering this is the last Chevys in the Las Vegas valley I am going to go easy on them. I really like the ambiance of Chevys. Their margaritas are pretty awesome too, especially the Watermelon ones you can get during the summer. 

I like the veggie fajitas. They come out piping hot and the tortillas are always fresh. The chicken chimichanga is really good too, if you like the fried aspect of it. 

However, when you have a special request, your wait staff should not roll their eyes at you and say \"yeah, uh, we don't DO that.\" (Especially when it involves sitting in another area so our young children do not disturb other diners). It's rude. So it would have been 4 stars for the food, but one gets knocked off by the rude and inconsiderate hostess."}
{"text":"My parents are obsessed with this restaurant and I think it has something to do with the \"kids eat free on Tuesdays\" thing. My sister and I were talking about how much we dislike eating here, and a few hours later, we were sitting in Chevy's for the millionth time, with that, \"Ugggh\" look on our faces.

I'm not a huge fan of the food here yet my parents always choose to bring us here. When I lived in California, they weren't fans of the place, but now they are. Whatever. Their salsa is okay. I like their dry sherry chipotle sauce that comes on one of their enchiladas but other than that sauce and their flautas, everything else is just \"okay.\" 

The only reason this location gets three stars is because of the prime people watching that can be experienced. For whatever reason, we're usually seated near the rail that divides the mall from the restaurant, so we get to see everybody coming and going. Try not to choke to death on a chip while laughing at all the foolery that walks through the doors, especially from the teenagers and their ghetto swagger.

The foolery doesn't stop at the entrance. My funniest experience was with this weirdo teenaged boy who would not stop staring at my sister and me and making weird sounds. We made exaggerated moves so it was obvious that we were talking about him. For example, my sister told me to turn around while I was eating. I make a huge turn and this kid is literally eating his napkin - it was hanging from his mouth by his teeth. He stopped and literally just sat there stunned, with a napkin halfway hanging out of his mouth. I proceeded to laugh. My manners escape me at this restaurant when it comes to craz-o boys."}
{"text":"Updating to add that managememt reached out to me asking for more info, which I sent, claiming they wanted to send me a giftcard to make up for my bad experience. Not something I would have asked for but I thought, what the heck, they are trying, so I'll give them another try...3 1/2 months later...no gift card has arrived. Way to make a bad experience worse Chevys!"}
{"text":"Although Chevy's is not the most authentic Mexican you will find, I don't think it quite deserves the bad reviews I've seen.

I stopped in here for lunch after an appointment with my eye doctor in the mall.  It wasn't busy, and I sat at the bar.  The service was fast and very friendly. I only ordered a water, but was also quickly brought chips and salsa.  The chips weren't my favorite, they didn't seem authentic, but I liked the salsa.

I wasn't really impressed with the menu selections - especially on their lunch menu, but I decided to go with the farmer's market enchiladas.  They were supposed to be made with mushrooms and artichokes (I love both), but there were tons of other veggies in there as well.  I am not sure I saw an artichoke, and I only saw 1 mushroom, but they were still tasty.  They were served with a side of rice and grilled vegetables (no beans? In a \"Mexican\" restaurant?).

Overall, it was a good experience - nothing mind blowing, but not horrible.  The service was great and I was in and out of there pretty quickly.  I wouldn't mind coming back for their weekday happy hour."}
{"text":"GHETTO!  I had the chili con queso and it was VELVEETA with salsa.  I even asked about it!  I was really disappointed with it.  It distracted me so much, I didn't even order dinner.  I went to the one at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"This place has a nice environment along with good food. Happy hour here is probably the best for any mexican restaurants. What's better than $3 dollar drinks that are pretty exquisite and half off huge appetizer plates?"}
{"text":"Service, food, price, atmosphere, and drinks were excellent.  Flavor and portion were generous."}
{"text":"I have come here at least once a week with my bf and order what we like. I rly like being healthy ordering a Chopped salad and Tortola soup as a pic 2and bc of work we come at lunch time. Good prices and wonderful chips. They know us now so it's a wonderful company. They are also quick on their feet :) good job"}
{"text":"First time in many years. Salsa still the same. Came for lunch.  The place was empty. GF had the chicken fajitas. Said they were good.  I tried the combo. Tortilla soup. .Had a bite to it. Plenty of chicken and avacado. Also the Cobb salad with Chipotle dressing was different.  All in all the amount was filling.  They made us some fresh flour tortillas, very good. I like it but the music was loud. Hard to have a conversation.  Don't think people do that much anymore..cellphones and tablets.  Ice team is 3.50 w/ refills.  Tasted fresh brewed.will go back when in Henderson..of course."}
{"text":"Lame selection of beers and lame restrictive happy hour menu - why just discount some of the beers?  Mall location often means longer wait times too, and this mall is becoming the sister mall to Metrocenter in so many ways beyond that.  Food was alright, service was a bit slow, and parking is nowhere near the entrance (because it is always full)."}
{"text":"Compared to the Chevys I went to when I lived in New Jersey, the food were pretty much... lower than what I usually expect. I'm somewhat guessing because the menu changed a bit. But the place was small and such but the service was nice. Though I was surprised to see the bartender being our waiter."}
{"text":"Great salsa & chips and many specials which change often. Happy Hour prices are awesome and include flavored margaritas. Food quality and service vary, and the atmosphere can be festive. Try the seafood enchilada and fish tacos. 
Great spot for taking a break from shopping!
Happy Hour has been expanded to 2-8 every day. Call to confirm."}
{"text":"Hmmm what to say about this chevy's.  Our waiter brought us out chips and salsa with two cups of salsa.  He informed us that he wasn't allowed by chevy's management to bring us 2 salsas unless we asked for them, but that he was sucha renegade that he had brought us 2 and damn the man.  We obviously assumed he had only told us this / done this to get a better tip, since bringing us 2 salsas is more work for him than only bringing us one.

Then we ordered guacamole, which he didn't bring us.  So, not good for the tipping there.

Then when we told him to cancel our guacamole, he said he would cancel it from the bill but bring it to us anyway.  This twist made us decide that probably he just hated working at Chevy's and wanted to screw them in any way he could, big or small, so we were back on his side again.

Then when he brought us the bill, he put it down between the two of us but said \"Here you go, sir\" to my friend, which was really weird (my friend always gets handed the bill when we go out together since he is a man and I am a woman, but it always cracks us up because it never happens to us except when we are in champaign urbana, and then it happens every time.)"}
{"text":"Awww!  It's closed?
This was my favorite place for lunch and dinner when I was in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was poor. Management needs to hire better service people, I been here twices thinking the first time I got unlucky with the server but that is what you get everytime you go here.
Or 
Maybe the need a new MANAGER.

Also is very expense."}
