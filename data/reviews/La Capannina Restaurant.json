{"text":"Went for dinner with couple of friends. The restaurant has dim lights and staff is very friendly. Quite place. Appropriate for mature people or a romantic date."}
{"text":"We've been there twice in the past year. The food is good. You can argue \"authentic\" or \"real\" or whatever but let's just say this is good value for money and a nice evening out in \"old\" Brampton.  Yes, decor is a bit dated and \"old school\" but the service was \"old school\" too which to me means the waitstaff are well-trained and genuine without being over-rehersed or rushed or clumsy or and of the other negatives I've experienced at more \"modern\" places. It isn't as noisy as some of the newer-style places either which meant I could converse with my friends without shouting. (Who was it who decided that noisy = exciting?) 
Prices were reasonable and portions are quite substantial--both times I brought home part of my entree. 
The deserts are to die for! I'm not even going to pick one over the other--just close your eyes and point!"}
{"text":"We did a special occasion at this place on a sunday and it surpassed our expectations. From the beginning the head chef / owner was  very helpful and always available to explain all of our options. The service was impeccable and surpassed our expectations. I was not expecting as much attention as we received. Food was delicious and brought out with ease and at the right times. I highly recommend this place for special events."}
{"text":"Convenient location for good pasta dishes if one is catching a show at the Rose Theatre. It's been a little while, but I remember the decor being quite dated."}
{"text":"We really like this place. The food is good and reasonably priced. Note that the ownership has recently changed and the decor has been (slightly) updated. But it still has the great food we love."}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to have lunch at La Capeninna around 2:20pm before they closed and when we went in we found out their servers had left for the afternoon so the chef/owner actually came out, seated us and served us himself. He was so hospitable and accommodating from beginning to end. The food is good, not overcooked and their pasta sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"Located in the 'romantic' district of downtown Brampton (tucked in between construction rubble and the LCBO), you'll find La Capannina, which for me has always been a reliable Italian restaurant, in a city where finding a classy restaurant can be like gently tugging on teeth.

I've been there a few times, and depending on what you order, it can be a little on the pricey side, but I've never had anything there that didn't taste good.

The dining area is small, which allows for a more intimate setting, and there's little to no flash to it, very old school. The waitstaff is also very friendly and know the right times to come by.

They've recently made some changes in price and menu, but nothing really worth mentioning. It still feels like the La Capannina it has always been.

Not worth going out of your way for, but quality Italian in a pinch."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always greeted with super friendly staff and looked after very well the entire visit. The food is very consistent and the kitchen is quite accomodating when special requests are made on a dish.  My go to place for local Italian."}
{"text":"my boss gave me a gift certificate for this place, its dated and even though the owner is italian, it does not look or taste real italian, i think gordon ramsey needs to visit to update the decor and the dated menu..
its popular but who knows why???? to my knowlege no good italian restaurants in Brampton..."}
{"text":"All I can say good excellent, wine price fair, waiter staff friendly and professional, very good value for the money."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The serving sizes are big. I had the pollo lemone with a side of pasta which was excellent. Try and make reservations on the weekends as the get pretty busy. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was a very good buffet. Small cause it was part of a Birthday Party. 

There was house made cheese pizza to start which was good but could have been cooked more. 

The buffet consisted of Caesar Salad with house made dressing (very tasty). Bacon pasta (extremely tasty) with the factory chicken & Pork with mushroom sauce (tasty & tender). This was accompanied by an assortment of steamed veggies. 

Very good buffet & I walked away with a full belly & a smile on my face value there was lots of food to eat & to choose from. I'd redo this place but I'd skip the factory chicken."}
{"text":"After reading the menu online I was a little wary of eating here, a lot of the dishes aren't actually \"authentic\" Italian like they claim, but we were going for my grandparent's anniversary so I went in with no expectations. Our server was very friendly and enthusiastic and we got our drinks and orders in quite quickly. 

The first thing to come was the bread, I can tell the bread is fresh and tasted homemade. So happy with that! The olive oil to go with the bread wasn't bad, pretty standard. Next we ordered the mushroom caps for appetizer. They smelled amazing, and they tasted pretty good, nicely seasoned. I only wish there were a few more of them, the portion size was a little small for the price and they're just mushrooms after all. 

It took quite a while to get the main course, but if it's made fresh to order I'm okay with this. I ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola because I noticed they make their gnocchi in house. The table also ordered veal parmigiana, jumbo shrimp and linguine marinara. The piece of veal is definitely generous and the pasta dishes are also quite large. The jumbo shrimp dish is a little smaller, 6 decent sized shrimp, not the biggest jumbo shrimp I've ever seen but bigger than shrimp in a shrimp ring. It did come served with a side of veggies but I think maybe some rice or potatoes would complete the dish, so if you are a bigger eater definitely get the pasta side. 

I did get to try a bite of the shrimp and they were nicely seasoned, the garlic sauce had a nice balance to it and the shrimp were cooked well. The veggies on the side were actually seasoned unlike a lot of other places, unfortunately all besides the broccoli were overcooked. On to the gnocchi; unfortunately the cream sauce with gorgonzola was a let down. It just tasted like cream because there wasn't enough gorgonzola. The dish could use about 4 times more gorgonzola! The positive is the gnocchi were delicious themselves, so soft, you can tell they were actually homemade and fresh. This place definitely has potential to deliver some great dishes, hence my 3 star. But they need to tweak a few things before I'd go back. Please if you're going to have a dish based on gorgonzola don't hold back! I should be tasting more gorgonzola than cream. That dish could have been so good if the cream sauce was up to par. 

The rest of the table enjoyed their dishes, I didn't get a chance to try them but they looked good. It took a little too long at the end to collect the plates when we were done and get our bill, but our server looked really busy trying to clean up at closing. Still I think it's more important to check in on tables maybe in between other duties. A few things to improve, but this place has potential."}
