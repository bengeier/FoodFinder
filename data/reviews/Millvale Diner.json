{"text":"Line at pamelas was way too long. We sat immediately at this place, friendly service, good food."}
{"text":"Horrible service sat for 40 mins before waited on, saw two other tables leave because they weren't waited on. They were out of drinks and food that we wanted to order and then they finally brought out our food and it was wrong.. will never come back to this place"}
{"text":"This place is so much better than Pamela's across the street! Their breakfast potatoes are perfect---they're not shredded, they are just cut in little cubes with onions and peppers. Prices are super cheap, and service was friendly. Go here!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at the Millvale Diner is wonderful! The omelets are light and fluffy and stuffed with meat cheese and vegetables.  The potatoes are crispy and hot. The breakfast menu is extensive from eggs and bacon to a reuben omelet. Every comment about the food has been very positive. On the negative the service has not always been the best. On our most recent 2 visits there were new servers who did their best to provide us with a positive experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time even thinking of coming here. I really feel bad for the employees having to deal with the owner.  Being friendly to your customers is a huge part in operating a successful establishment in the service industry. If selling jerk burgers or jerk eggs satisfies patrons, he would have a very lucrative business; because that is what he is good at.  It's in a great location, especially being across the street from another diner that is extremely busy. It would be very easy to take advantage of that overflow if this guy would treat people with a little respect.  I can't imagine there is much repeat business at this place unless he happened not to be there on that certain day.  The Soup Nazi was successful, but he had a desired superior product."}
{"text":"I looked on Yelp for diner-deli food and Millvale Diner came up and I'm happy with our choice.  Friends from all over the country (NYC, CO, VA) were with me and they all raved about their food too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did. But they are just not great at customer service. You walk in & linger awkwardly until someone finally decides to notice you, then we sat at our table for about 20 minutes while no one even looked in our direction. When the waitress finally came over to take our drink order we told her we were ready to place our food order as well, she flat out told us no, you can't place your food order before I get you your drinks... Wait, what?? She literally refused to take our food order. Then, after insisting she MUST take only our drink order, she brings us over empty coffee cups and says \"your coffee will be several minutes.\"  So now, after not being allowed to give our food order, we still don't even have drinks. Once I'm given permission to order food, I order an omelet that comes with home fries & toast, I asked if they had rye, she said yes so I said \"ok, I'll have that.\" to which she responds \"just 1 rye?\" What kind of question is that?! Omg, the list of bizarre things this girl said/did just goes on & on. The food was decent (definitely NOT better Pamela's as some other reviewers have said) & definitely good quality & quantity for the price. But seriously, I cannot get over how poorly we were treated, not just by our server but the entire staff. They were all just warm bodies at best. It was like none of them had ever worked in a restaurant before, just totally clueless. And the food was not so amazing that one could overlook the extreme lack of good customer service. I would be willing at some point to give it one more shot in hopes that today was anomaly, but something tells me that's the standard."}
{"text":"I was in Millvale to do laundry at the 24 hour laundromat. Intended to eat at Pamela's but they were closed. I am very glad they were. I was greeted warmly by the owner/waiter/chef, and shown to a table. Drinks were promptly served. So many delicious sounding things on the menu made picking one thing difficult. My daughter and I decided on the Steel Workers Breakfast. It comes with 3 eggs your way, choice of meat, choice of potatoes, choice of bread and two pancakes. I chose over easy, sausage, home fries  and white toast. My daughter went with scrambled, ham, home fries and rye toast. The food was amazing. The best thing was the home fries. So crisp, yet soft, the bell peppers and onions gave them a wonderful flavor. Both my eggs and my daughters were cooked perfectly. She is very picky about her eggs and usually whines that they are over cooked. These were not. Everything really was above and beyond any breakfast I have had outside my grandmothers kitchen. The service was great as well. The only drawback is the wait time from placing order to the arrival of the food. This time delay is because nothing is precooked. However, for the quality of food I received I will go back over and over. Totally worth the wait. When the person in the kitchen has a passion for food and enjoys cooking quality food it shows. I highly recommend a trip to Millvale Diner very soon."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on Memorial Day since we didn't realize Pamela's across the street would be closed.

Immediately began to regret our decision. The server was not very attentive - it took us 10 minutes to even get waters and coffees brought to the table, and another half hour or so for food to arrive.

The food was actually pretty solid when it did come - I had the Reuben omelet and enjoyed it, and my friends enjoyed their food as well.

We didn't even wait for our checks to walk to the register and cash out. The waitress had to look up all of our orders in the menu for prices, so it took almost 10 minutes for the 5 of us.

Maybe they were short-staffed from the holiday, but I'd avoid this diner unless you have some extra time (and patience) on your hands."}
{"text":"I love Millvale Diner. Every time I've been here I've made sure to tell them how great their food is. Perfect price point and friendly staff! I'd suggest this for breakfast any day."}
{"text":"It's hard to even give this place a single star. It's a sad excuse for a restaurant. I went here for breakfast and waited 40 minutes for my food. It took the waiter 20 minutes to clean the surrounding tables and the people coming in had to stand in the lobby for a while. Someone who I was with had to leave because it took them so long to get their food. I watched two tables of people leave because they only got a menu and were never waited on. DO NOT GO HERE. They aren't friendly and do not know how to work with paying customers."}
{"text":"Above decent food, impressive, detail focused and diligent service. Totally fits the bill for when you don't want or n√©ed the hoity Pamela's. Would def go back. It felt very clean and not the typical greasy diner. Happy we found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start out with the good, my husband loved his pancakes, and I loved my home fries.....other than that? Shannon the waitress was totally stressed out because she said it was busy.........it was not, I'm a waitriess, I should know. She was awkward, and made me feel uncomfortable, not a pleasant experience.  The whole time we were there, empty tables were not cleared. The other waitress albeit young and most like inexpericenced asked us an another table if we saw someone take a tip off of another table, that was empty, but not cleared, and she should have cleared it as she walked by because I couldn't see hide nor hare of a bus boy. When I went to pay , this same waitress was flustered because she said the other waitress made her ring out customers at the register. Seriously? It's a small place! Oh and when I brought up my check, she actually said to me, \"Do I have time to take the drinks over to my table?\" I ignored her and just stood there.......they both verbalized comments that should have been kept to themselves."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place has the best breakfast food in Pittsburgh. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the service is crap, although it's gotten better recently. Not sure what the waiting staffs deal is, they are a little on the slow side if you know what I mean. But the food makes up for the crap service and is well worth the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Pancakes and home fries are the best around. Very nice people! The owner/chef will make you practically anything you want. Quiet and quaint little diner."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviewers, went to Pamela's but a huge wait prompted a walk across the street to Millvale diner.  The ambience was poor, felt kind of old and dirty. The wait staff was pleasant but service slow... Should've stayed at Pamela's.... Would not have taken much longer. They \"ran out\" of pancakes and hashed Browns!!! Unbelievable for a breakfast joint.  Once the food came, it was good. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets any business at all is because they get all of Pamela's over flow. The waitresses are nice but slow and probably over worked. The owner who is also the cook in the kitchen is a freaking jerk. I orderd the steak with eggs and my entire steak was gristle. When I asked about it the owner simply said \"that's just how it comes\" would you eat that crap? No. Horrible service, awful food. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"I was a little worried by the lack of business but I was pleasantly surprised stopping for breakfast at 12:30 pm on a Saturday. Very clean and everything we ordered was fantastic."}
{"text":"I decided to update my review because after visiting here again, a few years later, I've found that this place still isn't worth anyone's money. Just like before, we decided to come here after the line at Pamela's was too long. We thought maybe Millvale Diner would be better since the last time we visited they were still relatively new. We entered and there were about three tables of four and a few patrons at the diner bar. Our party of five was seated in the dining room, which still is very oddly decorated and bare. We were the ONLY people in this room. It was noon, peak dining hours on a Sunday. Across the street at Pamela's there was a line out the door and this place couldn't fill more than a handful of tables. Bad sign #1. The waitress immediately told us they were short-staffed, which seemed odd because there were definitely more than two servers and like I said, only a few tables of eaters. Bad sign #2. We sat for about 20 minutes and there was no sign of her. She never returned to ask about beverages or anything. We got up and left and returned to Pamela's to find the line much shorter and worth the wait. I don't know how this place is still open. \"Short staffed\" or not, the waitress at Millvale Diner could have at least gotten us some water or coffee straight away (or even just took our drink order!) to hold us over. We all agreed that if we had at least ordered or been given drinks we would have waited it out. Instead we were ignored for 20 minutes and they lost out on probably $50 + tip that they clearly needed."}
{"text":"This joint looked like something straight out of kitchen nightmares.  My friend and I were originally going to go to the really busy diner right across the street, but since they didn't take credit cards, we came to the Millvale Diner instead.  
We walked in and the place looked like a ghost town. The d√©cor was bare, the walls looked like an institution, there were a few tables scattered here and there, and the floor was not terribly clean.  Now the diner RIGHT ACROSS the street was slammed, so I was a tiny bit concerned about what I was getting into from the moment I walked in the door.  I asked the waitress to seat us somewhere cool since it was a 94 degree day, and the woman stuck us by the window.  After two minutes there, I asked if we could be moved away from the window as the heat was making me nauseous.  She moved us to a table closer to the kitchen.  
She politely took our orders, informing me that to add blueberries to my pancakes it would cost an extra $1.50.  I shrugged, despite knowing that a pound of blueberries were only $2.99 last week when I bought them.
I ordered a breakfast that consisted of two eggs (sunny side up), two pieces of bacon, two pancakes and home fries.  I saw the cook in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal as I waited for my food.  
I received my food about twenty minutes later, and my eggs were over-easy (not sunny side up), my bacon was over cooked and flavorless, my home fries had this disgusting reddish spice oil covering it.  The home fries also contained green peppers and onions.  I also had no pancakes.
I waited a few minutes before asking for my pancakes.  When they finally arrived, they were crumbling apart, and I couldn't spread butter on them without them turning into butter/blueberry/flour paste.  What a joke.  

Next time, I'll go to P&G right across the street. Never again."}
{"text":"I hope none of us die from the food we just ate. We came here after seeing the longer than usual line at Pamela's. Walked in and no one looked at us or acknowledged us, so we decided to sit down at an open table that needed cleaned. We had to ask them to remove the glasses from the previous table. The table was never cleaned, we are lucky we even got silverware. Apparently you're not allowed to order food at the same time as your drinks too. Drinks must be ordered first. No one seems to have a clue what they are doing here. Spare yourselves and just wait in line for Pamela's."}
{"text":"I was really shocked to see such low reviews because we had a great meal here. Like the others, we were heading to Pamela's but didn't want to wait over an hour to get seated. We decided to try this place, as it is right across the street. It was pretty empty, but worried me at first, but Pamela's has a big name and a lot of locations throughout the city, so it's easier for them to draw a crowd. We had a party of 8 and they seated us immediately.

Our server was great and even took orders for each of the 4 couples on separate checks. Yes,I know it's an inconvenience and yes, we should have all brought cash, but it happens! I've experienced some unnecessary eye rolls and attitude in the past and was very pleased when our server had the complete opposite reaction and didn't mind at all! 

We had a mix of omelets, pancakes and some lunch appetizers. Everyone was really pleased with the portion size and the food. I definitely took half of my gigantic home. Plus, they serve breakfast all day which is #1 in my book!"}
{"text":"I have visited this diner twice.
It's a nice place to grab a brunch or breakfast in the local area.
We had a variety of items from eggs benedict to pancakes and hash browns.  Food was ok, somewhat under-seasoned.  This seems like a smaller family owned business and I have seen the same one server both times when I visited.  Everyone was very nice and we didn't wait long at all for our food to come out.   We did not experience a wait on a Sunday morning and the food hit the spot."}
{"text":"Definitely tasty and we didnt have to wait for a seat! You have to be a little patient with the service but it's worth it. We'll choose this over Pamelas from here on out! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"BEST Greek omelet ever!! And the home fries are to die for - I can't wait to go back for breakfast again! Newly remodeled and clean. Get yourself here for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast food here is delicious! I'm an omelet lover, and this is the place to go! This isn't a place to visit if you're in a hurry. The owner/cook takes pride in the food he serves and cooks everything fresh and to order. I still haven't had any lunch/dinner entrees. No matter what time of day I visit, I go with breakfast! Prices are fair."}
{"text":"The food is awesome!
The hospitality is awesome!
The owner really cares about what he serves.
This is a must eat at the diner!"}
{"text":"The food really is the MVP at this place! The servers are always pleasant and attentive as well. The local color commentary was fun the first time! I've never seen someone negotiate the price of soup ? The ambiance is lackluster and the dishes are straight out of a hospital dumpster but the food is quite diner tasty!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. This is comfort food, and has one of the best menus of any diner I've ever been to.  The staff is always friendly no matter how many people are there, and the owner/cook comes out to our table to see how we like the food every time.  And its great, every time."}
{"text":"The food is very good here but the owner is unbelievably rude. To both his employees and customers."}
{"text":"I have been to the Millvale Diner a number of times. It is a friendly place with the best omelets. I have always ordered omelets and never been disappointed.  The home fries and pancakes are done perfectly. 
The ONLY thing that bothers me is the 8 AM open time. I would love to see a 6AM or 5AM so I can visit before work. Love this place"}
{"text":"Came to Millvale to visit family and attend my brothers wedding. We were looking for someplace to eat that was within walking distance of my parents, and my mom mentioned Millvale diner. We walked down not knowing what to expect. Walked into the diner and a nice older gentleman greeted us with \"Welcome, we've been waiting for you all day, what's kept you?  Table one is all set for you.\"  

We came in, sat down and the server brought us our menus and took our drink orders. It wasn't too long after that we had decided on what we want to eat. We ordered the Rodeo Burger and fries. The gentleman that greeted us went back and cooked our food, and it took a little longer than usual to prepare, but the gentleman, whom I assume is the owner told us that he makes all his burgers are prepared and cooked to order. He doesn't buy pre formed patties. That alone makes this place worth it. The food was outstanding, and very filling. The bill for what we got was pretty decently priced. When we come back to Millvale we WILL come here to eat again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I'm quite sure that not many people of color frequent this area; considering that everyone stopped talking when my husband and I walked in. The owner however didn't skip a beat. He was very hospitable and we recieved a warm and friendly greeting as we entered. 

The pineapple upside down pancakes were sweet, fluffy and flavorful. The cheesesteak omelet was meaty and cheesy. The Greek omelet was flavorful, filling and satisfying. 

  Do yourself a favor and head here instead of Pamela's."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  This is the second time.  It's not a flashy place just a basic restaurant.  The walls have kids drawings and chef pictures.  The one waitress is ok and the other is really nice.  The omelettes are made are ok but the cook puts way too much cheese in it and it lacks flavor.  You only get one slice of bread with your order."}
{"text":"Bizarre hours and negative reviews had kept me from trying Millvale Diner, a start-up canteen that replaced Kayla's Cafe recently, but another Mr. Smalls concert left me with little choice for a fresh Yelp, so enter its doors I did. 

Alabaster walls and traditional diner stools are essentially all one sees in terms of interiors, that and a man with an accent, a moustache, and a mission.

\"You keep it fresh, you can't go wrong,\" the man whose name I can't recall told me with a glint in his eye as I eagerly devoured a Mountain Man Burger, something he seemingly concocted with me, the warrior eater in mind. 

Members and crew of several other bands including Affiance and Protest The Hero charged in shortly after I seated myself. We all ordered simultaneously, and within 5 minutes, food as on my plate and in takeout boxes for the musicians and roadies. 

\"Do you have any help back there?\" I asked the middle-aged gentleman. 

\"No. I do it all myself. You see, it's all about timing.\"

All I could do was stare. 

From here on in, I shall refer to this man Burra Sahib. 

And he had a challenge for me to complete...

\"You may use silverware, young man,\" Burra Sahib advised. 

Two patties of hulking ground chuck, an over easy egg, raw red onion, onion rings, lettuce, tomato, American cheese, bacon, and mayonnaise were held together by a sesame seed bun and accompanied with exemplary battered fries. My teeth opened the morning godbeast with a gash that bled molten yellow yolk before I reached for weapons, realizing that my bare hands would not ensure victory.  The meat, cooked to a sublime medium-rare astonished with its freshness, savory beefiness, and soft texture, contrasting beautifully with the crunch of the vegetables and deep-fried, breaded halos, the bacon adding fat and brine. All told, this was a giant of a burger, one worthy of the heartiest carnivores.

Dessert was a humble cut of spongy, fudge-laden bake-sale variety chocolate cake garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and chocolate syrup. 

Burra Sahib was pleased, cheering my win like a king would a gladiator. 

\"Ah, a clean plate. I take it you didn't care for the burger,\" he joked. 

I wished Sahib well, promised another visit, and headed off into the brisk air for...

{"text":"Okay here's where we're at.... After trying to find a place to eat without a line we find this place that looks pretty nice with no line.  I ask how long the wait is and the waitress replies just you guys... Perfect!

I see another room I wasn't aware of so I go look in.... Three empty tables.  I told the employee that there were three open tables... She said really?  I thought there was just one.  So by your brilliant logic, you couldn't have sat us at the open table you knew about???

Then the group behind us is sat for no rhyme or reason (maybe an elderly person who couldn't stand or something)

We then get seated after making awkward eye contact with the woman behind the counter for a minute.  We get menus which had literally every possible item you could think of....

After waiting about 10 minutes for maybe a water or some coffee or something, someone comes up to us and asks if we've been helped her.  We had not and informed her of such.  She nods, says okay and walks away.  Other wait staff come by to fill coffee for others.... The original Mensa member who asked us if we had been helped then comes back and starts rearranging butter packets and salt on an adjacent table.  

At this point of 20 minutes of zero service we got up and left... Like other tables had done before us.  

Seriously avoid this place like the plague.  My guess is that you won't have to for long as they continue to alienate and ignore potential customers."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant disregards the seriousness of food allergies and puts people's health at risk. 

My friend and I stopped in today for a bite. She ordered a Greek salad, i ordered the western omelette. The Greek salad that came had iceberg lettuce, tomato, egg, gyro meat, feta cheese and croutons, which imo is more of a gyro salad than a Greek salad, but I digress. 

The salad came with croutons. My friend has celiac disease and can't have even trace amounts of gluten found in bread found in croutons, which see didn't realize came on this salad. She asked the waitress to order a new salad because even picking the croutons off is risky.

The waitress took the salad to the kitchen and we could hear the conversation between her and the cook/owner. She explained to the guy the situation. I could hear the guy give her a hard time about it. First he asked if she requested no croutons. As if to blame the waitress for an oversight. She rightly said that we didn't request \"no croutons\" when it was first ordered, because we didn't. You don't usually request things that aren't expressly included, but I digress again. I couldn't make out the rest of what he said, but you could tell he was basically not trying to make us a new salad. Not even a minute goes by, and the guy comes out with a salad that has a lot more feta cheese than the last one, and seemingly no croutons. 

My friend starts to dig in, and she finds a little goddam crouton in her salad. That dude, after specifically being asked to make a new salad, due to a food allergy, knocked off the croutons and sent the same damn salad back to my friend.

At this point, he was eating lunch in the dining room, so I asked him if he made a new salad or if he just took the croutons off. He fessed up and said he just took the croutons off. We both told him that was completely unacceptable! He began arguing with us, insisting that it was my friend's responsibility to ask about allergens and that we should have known that ALL salads always come with croutons. He told the waitress to take the salad and told my friend, \"No more salad for you!\" 

At this point, I really lost my shit. I explained that I've never had a Greek salad with croutons, and that even if we should have done something different, it didn't change the fact that he knowingly and intentionally gave my friend food that would have made her very sick if she ate it. 

I then demanded my check because i couldn't be in his presence for one more second. The waitress gave us the check and took the salad off, thankfully. I filled out my bill, tipped the waitress (still heated as hell) and left. 

As I was sitting in my car I see the owner walking toward me out if the corner of my eye. I roll down the window, he gives me the bill and says, \"you signed the wrong copy.\" 

REALLY DUDE!??? You're lucky I didn't walk out of your establishment entirely and without giving you a single solitary cent!!!

I signed the check while he literally carried on endlessly about how wrong it was of me not to sign the correct copy. 

I told him to stop talking. Then I told him he was an asshole, and we parted ways with middle fingers in the air and a death stare that I'm pretty sure he lost. 

Despite my delicious omelette, I for certain won't be returning to Millvale Diner. 

The owner had ZERO concern for my friend's allergen request, despite the explicit nature of a request that I know was made very clear by the waitress when the salad was returned. 

I get that people shrug their shoulders about food allergies, and think that people are making stuff up. That is an unfortunate mindset that really can harm people."}
{"text":"Best kept secret. Solid diner breakfast. Clean and bright. Has own small parking lot. My friend recommended this because another famous diner had long waiting line. Friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Pamela's across the street, but they had a line and I didn't want to stand for a long time, so we walked across the street to the Millvale diner. I am very glad we did. I had the special; gravy over biscuits (3), two eggs over medium and I also ordered toast in addition to the special. All I can say is yum! The eggs were perfectly cooked, the gravy was a rich white sauce with good quality sausage. The toast wasn't very toasted and not very warm, when I told the waitress this she immediately took care of it. The only thing off a little is it was after 1pm and they weren't serving lunch yet. When I asked when they started serving lunch I was told \"not until after 2pm.\" I'm not sure if that is all the time or just on Saturdays. I'm really glad the breakfast was so good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this morning due to Pamela's being jammed. They were a little understaffed, but the lady worked really hard trying to accommodate everyone. All four of us really liked our food. I recommend the Steelworker which comes with eggs, bacon, home fries and pancakes. The coffee was also excellent. The owner is a very pleasant man who goes out of his way to talk to the customers. I love Pamela's, but this place is every bit as good."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me. Usually just super awesome breakfast food but this time I decided to try some lunch food. I got a grilled chicken wrap and they knocked it out of the water. Seriously this thing was the size of my forearm and packed witch chicken and cheese and veggies. I would skipmpamelas unless there is something particular that you want there. It keeps getting better every time I go."}
