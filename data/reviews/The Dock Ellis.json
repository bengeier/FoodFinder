{"text":"If you want a fun, local place to relax, this is it. Good vibes, yummy snacks. We even had an event there and they were super accommodating with great service. It was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW -Chef Trish Gill (formerly Sous-Chef of Beast) has dreamt up a menu of inexpensive bar snacks with an upscale twist. Imagine the regular suspects- nachos, wings, sandwiches, and fried foodstuffs- but given some unexpected culinary upgrades.  For example, rather than a basket of frozen McCain superfries, Gill is serving up fried goodies like house made Tater-Tots or Fried Beets.  Regular store-bought tortilla chips in a platter of nachos get reimagined with wonton chips. And your processed Grilled Cheese got a kick in the pants with a jalapeno popper filling and two slices of the celebrated OMG bread. -Divided into Bar Snacks, Big Snacks and Sandwiches-some may argue that the most impressive thing about this place is the price. Nothing is offered over $10. A-maz-ing. It's also very shareable, meaning you can casually nosh and order as your party's appetite grows.  Fried Beets, Spiced Pepitas, Citrus Aioli ($5)  Deliciously good. The colourful beets were perfectly juicy and tender within with a delicate but satisfying crispy texture outside. I also loved the counterbalance of the sweetness of the beets with the tangy aioli and nutty crunch of the seeds.  Sweet Potato Stuffed Cornbread, Waylon's Bacon Dressing ($5)  One of my favourite bites of the day. While cornbread is often dry, this version had an extra level of moisture from the luscious whipped sweet potatoes, while its sweetness was balanced out with the drizzle of salty pork. Yum.  Dill Pickled Eggs, Smokey Pigs' Ears ($5)  Sometimes pickled eggs can feel too rich but these had a nice balance of creamy fatty yolk, tangy aioli and crispy salty fried pig. Retro revisited and done really well.  Sausage Roll, Plum Ketchup ($5)  These were nothing like the humdrum frozen sausage rolls I grew up with at family get togethers. With its flaky buttery pastry and spiced moist meat mixture, this felt a bit more like a hand-held tourtiere than a roll. Call it whatever you want, just give it a good smear through than sweet and tangy plum sauce and bring it to me.  Rye Whiskey & Maple Crackerjack ($5)  Honestly, I know this is so simple because I make it all the time, but they got the popcorn/nut/caramel ratio right. I like when there is a clear excess of caramel to the popcorn, and these clusters were brimming with the chewy sweet stuff. I meant to ask for a second (or third) bag to take home- it was just so good.  Tete-r-Tots, Crème Fraiche, Diablos Fuego ($5)  Stuffed with tender pulled pork, this dish turned out way better than I expected it to be. The filling was meaty, salty, sweet and tender to juxtapose the crispy golden exterior outside, while the Diablos Fuego (my personal favourite hot sauce) stood in with enough acid and heat to cut the fat. A definite must order.  Wonton Nachos, House Chorizo, Salsa, Cheese Sauce, Pickled Jalapenos, Crema ($10)  Now, I have eaten  a lot of nachos in my lifetime and have seen a lot of creative takes. But the wonton wrapper standing in for a corn chip? Bloody genius. These chips were evenly seasoned, light as air, and had a delicate sweetness that took the classic bar food to a whole other guilty-pleasure level. You cannot come here without ordering these nachos.  Confit Roster Wings with Smokey BBQ sauce ($10)  Obviously, these are not your average bar wings. These are bad ass meaty mommas that take that wet nap to places it's never seen before. Put on the bib if you're skiddish- things are about to get deliciously messy.  Lime Pot de Crème with Sailor Jerry Rum Caramel Sauce & Shortbread ($5 x 2)  I loved the combination of the tangy custard and the bitter sweet caramel, especially with the textural contrast of the buttery cookie. My only criticism is that it was a bit difficult to push a spoon through the caramel to retrieve some of the luscious cream below without almost peeling the sticky layer of sweetness off in one go. It just took a little finagling to get it evenly on my spoon (and yes, I maybe had to put a few fingers in the pot to help things out)- but it was definitely worth the sticky fingers.   Closing Remarks:  -For 8 \"snacks\", 2 \"big snacks\" and 3 drinks (enough to generously feed 3), the bill came to $95 including tax and tip- seriously, it doesn't get much better value than that. -Sure, the Dock Ellis may predominantly attract the casual drinking, chilling and/or sports watching crowd- but it would be a shame to overlook it's greatest charm- the really good food served at really reasonable prices.  So if you're looking for somewhere to watch a game, play a round of pool over drinks with a group of friends, or grab a casual bite in the west end, then I would recommend putting the Dock Ellis high up on your list."}
{"text":"Really liked this place, and since it's a project of the very friendly, awesome guys from the Emmet Ray, I like it even better. This is a great place to bring a mixed-bag group of people... some who like sports and some who don't. The bar has a nice relaxed atmosphere with good food and drink options for those who don't care about what's on the screens.... and they have lots of big screens for those who do care about what's on the screens. Good work guys!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best bar food I've had in Toronto. The chicken sandwich is on par with PG Cluck's and the wanton nachos are a great snack.  The bartenders/servers are always friendly and accommodating. Lots of TVs for whatever sports you want to watch.   They also have $5 pints of a rotating beer for blue jays games, which is a nice bonus for what is already a great spot."}
{"text":"Killed sometime with a friend here on a Thursday night.  The place was hopping.  It is absolutely a hipster sports bar it was not exclusionary or too cool for it's own good.  If you love local beers this is a great place.  The staff were super friendly and attentive. I would definitely return and try some food."}
{"text":"I've gone in a few times with friends to watch sports game and every time I've been there, there's that jerk behind the bar. Finally I went in when the axe thrower a**hole bartender (can't remember his name, starts with a 'C') wasn't there and told another staff member about how rude he is especially to women and it turns he is part OWNER!! I refuse to go in spend my money there and support this dicks wallet. It may be the only \"hipster\" sports bar in town for now but hopefully that changes soon."}
{"text":"They have a fantastic fried chicken thigh burger. *Fantastic*. Go have it.  Seating is either couches or long, wooden, communal tables. Good local beers on tap. Good service."}
{"text":"Solid two star establishment. Although I only visited the bar so I cannot comment on the food. Came in on a Saturday night around 10:30. They had a good crowd inside, watching sports, playing pool etc. They had long tables to sit and enjoy drinks, but most people just threw their coats/scarfs on the chairs and lingered around the bar, which left a bunch of empty seats that were \"taken\". I'm not from the area and was visiting, but the vibe I got was that most, if not all, patrons were regulars who frequented the bar in large groups. I approached the bar with one other guest and it was a struggle to get the bartender's attention. Not because he was busy, but the people at the bar who were just hanging out, not placing a drink order, seemed to be more important. I'm a patient patron, and I understand when workers are too busy or overwhelmed to serve me, but that was not what was going on here. Once we finally flagged someone down, my friend ordered a bottled beer - can't mess that up - and I got a vodka soda, which tasted like vodka with water. It came in a small glass, loaded with ice and no straw, which made it difficult to drink/stir. We spotted out a couch near the entrance where we drank our drinks rather quickly so we could continue down Dundas for some better options. Two stars for the cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Great place to watch sport, but terrible food. Everything we ordered was soggy, overly salty and dripping with grease. The food here relies too heavily on deep frying their food. They even deep fry their potato chips.   Aside from the food everything else makes for a good time. Lots of TV's for watching the game, shuffleboard, pool and foosball. Pretty solid for any bar in Toronto I think and loads of seating for when it packs up for a game. Just don't go there hungry."}
{"text":"Great place to host a party, just have to get there early to save a seat. The appetizer menu hosts quite a variety.   Their beef brisket sandwich was delicious!!!  Service is decent, as good as any hipster bar can get.  There's definitely enough entertaining things to do with fooseball tables, darts, pool, and table tennis you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I enjoy The Dock Ellis and it's sister-bar The Emmet Ray immensely, but I had an odd customer-service encounter last night. After spending a few pints at The Emmet, moseyed on down to The Dock for one of their great sandwiches with a friend who's never tried them.   Ordered some drinks, a shared plate, and two sandwiches. We wanted to each take a half of the sandwiches to try, so obviously asked to get them cut in half. They refused! Two different staff members. The only other time that's happened to me was at the most pretentious/annoying restaurant I've been to in Vancouver. I was brought a knife to do it myself because the kitchen has a policy against doing what customers want, I guess. A super small request to an otherwise not very busy establishment, and refused on principal. Dopey move, team.   Customer service taking an unnecessary backseat may cost the establishment in the long-run (at least from my wallet), especially when it overwrites whatever you thought of the food (tasted pretty good!)."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has a huge selection of beers both on tap and cans. The food is always great. Tons of TV's. Shuffleboard and pool, darts down stairs. It seems to fill up quickly! Always had a good time."}
{"text":"More good bar food is what this city is needing. I'll take the fact that things don't always hit. Like I had a fish sandwich that would have been way too fishy for 9/10 people. I like me an oily stinking piece of fish, too. In the right context. But on a fish sandwich, man...give me something moist and flavourless.   In any case, the point is that they are working their noggins at the Dock Eliis, providing food that tempts the belly while tugging at the old brain box, too. And when it works, it works and you will curse the fact that you ever went inside a chain big box faux irish pub and you will admit that you have been so much a part of the problem, but that now that the Dock Ellis is here you will do better.   Fried chicken thigh is a safe bet, but I have had very pleasing experiences with many of the $5 snacks.   I don't even like sports."}
{"text":"I came here for the world cup finals and OMG the fried chicken burger was sooooo satisfying.  A well thought out amount of crisp, flavour and juiciness.The perfect compliment to the match that we watched on the massive high resolution screen that they set up.  Very friendly and warm staff as well. I'm happy ; )"}
{"text":"This is what a sports bar should be. good beer, above average food, enough TVs without it being overwhelming....a pool and jits table.  Good crowd with a friendly atmosphere and staff that treat you well.  Great spot for the Raptors(well it was)."}
{"text":"Wandered into the Dock Ellis as step ... 3? 4? of an extended brewery/bar crawl to catch the Jays game while I was in town. At this point my recollection was beginning to slip, but here is what I remember, and what would bring me back if I was in Toronto:  Our waitress was great - sassy, attentive, full of good suggestions, and completely unwilling to let my beer be empty for very long.  The beer selection was awesome, and they made no pretension about the environment, happily serving it straight from the can.  There were plenty of TVs showing both the Jays game and also the final(?) Tragically Hip concert, so it was an awesome environment. As far as 'sports bars' go this is a good one, maybe next time I'll start here and try some food, as their menu is also enticing."}
{"text":"This is a great place , Jacob the new chef has elevated the menu to new heights.  Always friendly and attentive . This is the best and coolest place on Dundas West . Fun sports bar with a really nice atmosphere. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was toying with giving out a better rating, but the more I though about my experience, the more I dislike this place.  We went for a birthday gathering over the weekend to watch sports, play some shuffleboard, and enjoy some food and drink.   2 stars are really for the shuffleboard, which we spent the afternoon playing.  We attempted to watch the TFC and Jets game at the same time, but that was a failure because the bartender kept changing the channel. He meant to change one TV but kept changing a whole wall of TVs then complained when we asked for him to keep it on the original channel. There was our group of 8, plus two people sitting at the bar. Plenty of TVs, so no need to switch them all to golf when only 1 patron makes the request, especially when there is a large group in another section clearly watching other games. This really is not a place to go if you are a somewhat serious sports fan. No one seems actually interested in sports here.  We placed and order for food, but the surly bartender that didn't know how to work the TVs never punched it in. So an hour later the night shift started working and our food was nowhere to be seen. They comped our meal, which came after 1 h and 45m. That was nice of them. The sandwich was delicious(not worth the wait though) and the side of popcorn was stale and inedible.  If you're looking for a place to play shuffle board and hang out, this place should suffice. But if you're considering gathering to watch (even passively) a game, I'd look elsewhere. Also ... Hipsters. Lots of them."}
{"text":"I really liked it here:)! It kind of had a nice dive ish feel to it in a good way. The drink rose lexicon is pretty good but what is the best part about here is the atmosphere. They have great music choice here which is a little loud but nice. I liked how they had the option of fooseball and pool tables it gave it a fun, open atmosphere. I love how they have a deal for you to get four appys (bate in kind small portions) for twenty! That's a great deal and I'm definitely going back again for it! This place has a great vibe."}
{"text":"Very Hip Sportsbar. Decent selection of microbrews on tap. Named after the crazy pitcher who threw a no hitter on LSD. Sports bar for people who don't like sports bars!"}
{"text":"Went there last night as I was staying in the neighbourhood to watch a Leafs game. Sampled two kinds of draught beer and also their wonton nachos all excellent! Watching the Leafs less enjoyable as the size of the screens could be bigger. In the end I was told to leave for falling asleep in the bar, which I totally understand. To my excuse I was totally jetlagged just having flown in from Europe. Happy end as the Leafs won in an exciting game which I finished in my hotel room."}
{"text":"I just recently realized that the Dundas strip, west of Ossington is brimming with a few new sports bars.  Thank god someone decided to switch up the sports bar vibe a little bit.  Dock Ellis is a great spot to stop by on a weeknight, weekend, or whatever... catch a game, play some darts, eat some refreshingly new takes on bar food, and not find yourself in a cliche sports bar setting.  As mentioned earlier, it's essentially a sports bar for hipsters.  Staff is friendly, they have a half decent beer selection and the food is on par with restaurants in the area.  Oh, they also have a pretty cool darts league!  My only rant is the TV's are on the small side."}
{"text":"Awesome crowd tonight for the Raptors game. I recommend coming at least an hour early to get seats. Great service considering the large crowd. Fair prices too compared to the other bars in the area. A nice place for dates or for a large group of friends to grab a few drinks, play pool or watch a game. Most of the beers are from Amsterdam brewery ."}
{"text":"the food always great. good place to watch sports, cool place to hang out with friends. they have a pool table and a lot's of room. great atmosphere. welcoming and professional staff."}
{"text":"Food fries, crap craft beer, pool what else do you want? I totally recommend this place, I all come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty damn epic.   I got fried chicken sandwich.  He got a pub burger.  Both were amazing.  Service was on point.   And I got a hockey card in the deal."}
{"text":"Two very enthusiastic thumbs up.   Nestled in the Portuguese Sports Bar district on Dundas, The Dock Ellis is a bar for hipsters that like sports, as previous reviews suggests. But they do it extremely well, and in an unpretentious way. A very solid draught & bottle selection, a continuing rum special, and very capable and friendly staff. The menu an ecclectic and shockingly well executed surpise. Wonton Nachos and the wings are always a solid choice.   The crowd is friendly, sports savvy, and always welcome to join in as a 4th for foosball, or next to toss a loonie down for the pool table. Plus they have your rich friends rumpus room downstairs in the basement! Beware of the arcade machine upstairs though, she's tempermental and eats quarters on occasion.   It's nice to have a place outside my house where I can sob uncontrollably while enduring the Leafs, and not feel out of place. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Now this is how you do a modern sports bar!   Sister bar of the equally impressive Emmit Ray up on College, The Doc Ellis is a killer marriage between traditional sports bar and west end craft beer joint. My girlfriend and I came here a couple months ago, and were really surprised with the quality of food. If I recall correctly, we shared the fries, wings, a salad that doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore (shame because it was killer) and the fried chicken sandwich. Everything was delicious. Prices were extremely reasonable as well. Our server was tending bar at the same time, and even though it was busy was super on the ball and friendly too.  This is an awesome place to watch the game when you don't feel like dealing with the shitty macrobrews and uninspired food that tend to litter too many sports bars. I suppose if I had to nitpick something, it would be that the tap list isn't too expansive, and the beers themselves tend be safer picks (lagers, sessionable IPAs, etc.). This is nitpicking though. It is a sports bar after all.   The owner is a super nice guy too.  Glad this place is busy! Check it out."}
{"text":"Update time, as I am absolutely gutted to find out the Pineapple Pulled Pork has been taken off the menu. The good news is that their Fried Chicken Sandwich is pretty fantastic so my sandwich needs are still appeased.  Another negative, is that prices of most food items went up as snacks are now $6 instead of $5 and sandwiches $12 instead of $10. Also, the Mac & Cheese Bites were terrible this time as they were more cube-like and less patty like, and lacking both cheese and flavour inside.  The good news? This is still one of the best sports bars in the west end, thus retaining its 4 star rating. The crowd is lively but friendly, the beer selection is still great and craft focused (Hopsta La Vista now on tap too!), and there is still table shuffleboard, foosball, and a pool table for recreational game playing."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night around 11pm, not super busy no line and no cover. The crowd seemed older but local and in the neighborhood. The best part is that they have a pool table and a shuffle board table which is loads of fun. We didn't have to pay to use the shuffle board but not sure if thats an everyday thing or the machine was just broken. Its not the prettiest place, floors were slightly sticky and the decor was lacking, the tables seem to have lots of coats of paint. But there were lots of screens showing sports. Nothing fancy but the people were friendly"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I do know someone behind this (magnificent) operation. Being mindful of that bias, I'll just let you know what the deal is and recommend that you form your own opinion of how well it delivers first hand.   VIBE Laid back, but in no way a dive. Fits the west-end bar scene in look and vibe, but with a focus on sports; refreshing twist. Dim, candle-lit. Not as dark as your typical hipster hole but more flattering than the glare of most sports bars. It's a sports bar that's not a sports bar.  Rows of 10 person tables encourage communal seating / accommodate large groups. TVs behind the bar are perfect size for those lined up on the barstools. Larger TVs hung throughout the rest of the bar guarantee you a good view of the game regardless of where you're seated..   FOOSBALL Has it. I love this game way too much, and I'm really happy to see it in a bar that I won't be embarrassed to frequent. No more dealing with wasted undergrads wailing to Journey just to get my foos fix--\"not that there's anything wrong with that\".   POOL Has it.   FOOD Short menu elevates a couple of sports bar classics without getting too complicated.  LIBATIONS Safe to say the beer list will blow away that of your current sports bar. Staffers know their beer, so if you're unfamiliar with what they have on tap (ranging from Beau's Lugtred to Boneshaker) they can help you pick something that will tickle your fancy.  IN SUM Awesome west-end hangout."}
{"text":"The previous reviewer who said this is a sports bar for hipsters was totally right, but there's so much more to the Dock Ellis than that. This place is wild!   We went there for my boyfriend's bday party and the Dock Ellis was totally accommodating to our large group. They don't take reservations, so we showed up at 6 to snag the table that had a great view of the screens and was closest to all the games: foosball, shuffleboard, and a pool table. Downstairs there's a mini rec room featuring an air hockey table, ping pong and darts. It was the perfect place to throw a party!  This place scores points for its awesome food (everyone who ate anything was super impressed. Personally I tried a couple wonton nachos and they were divine!) and fantastic service. We started with a lovely blonde server who was super kind to replace a beer for free when the birthday boy accidentally knocked it over, but later in the night we were taken care of by a guy named Colin. He was great! Drinks arrived quickly and he was able to provide everyone with separate bills, which was especially helpful as we had a rotating crop of people come throughout the night.   I totally plan to go back here. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the Dock Ellis and I highly recommend it to everyone. Even my friends who don't particular care for \"the sports\" highly enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar for hipsters!   My boyfriend and his pals love sports. But they have a difficult time identifying with sports bars. Enter Dock Ellis, a bar named after an obscure acid trip baseball reference. Look it up.   Anyway, went here for a birthday on the weekend and had a blast. There's shuffleboard, a pool table and deliiiiicous snacks. Caramel and soy edamame and caramelized pecans? Don't mind if I do! I didn't get a chance to try the chickpea fries but the wonton nachos were tasty and there's a good selection of beer.  I'll definitely go back for friendly hangs soon."}
{"text":"If you don't know the story of Dock Ellis look it up. I have tried to come to this place a couple times but usually when they are completely full, but his time I went with a friend to watch a football game on Sunday afternoon. They have a combo that allows you to get any 4 x $5 item which we did plus we got some of there wings. The wings were really good but they are the complete wing and the small size is only 3 wings.   Overall I had a great time here because they had a ton of games on of football and the beer section was really good."}
{"text":"Craft bear was good but the food was amazing. Had Memphis fried chicken and burger and both were surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Great hang out spot! Decent amount of beer to choose from. You've gotta try their fried chicken sandwich! Service has always been good. They've got some games like shuffleboard, pool and fooseball to keep things entertaining."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I was there on a sunday around Christmas time and was happy to be able to get the SD Chargers game. It was crucial because it was win: and get into the playoffs or lose: and go home. One of the owners is a huge Chicago Bears fan some the main TV's were on that game but they were able to control each TV independently. This is big for a sports bar since there are a lot of sports going on at any given time.  This Sunday the kitchen was closed so I am unable to give any feedback on the food but I liked how the kitchen was set up. An open concept that allows the customers watch their food being prepared shows major confidence in their abilities.  I'm also a serious gamer (card games, board games, sports games, etc.) The Dock Ellis has a pool table, foozeball table and even a shuffle board! That's hard to find so I give major props to them.   All in all I'll be back every time I'm in Toronto and I'm there quite often!"}
{"text":"The Dock Ellis is a wicked hipster sports bar just west of Ossington and Dundas with a wide selection of beer and cocktails, (surprisingly) tasty apps (for a sports bar, that is), and a fun mixed crowd. To compare this to Jack Astor's (Yonge and Bloor) and Scaddabush Italian Kitchen and Bar (Yonge and Gerrard), this place is in a league of its own!  You walk in and there's tons of tables for groups, perfect for 4-6 people. There's a foosball table, a pool table, shuffleboard, and 4-5 TV screens for the game. The service is quick and friendly and the kitchen is open concept.   -Don't mind the photos that another Yelper uploaded of the empty tables, this must have been a dead night- The night we came, it was pretty much packed, not too many people that you're shoulder to shoulder, but a bustling atmosphere.  Pro tip: There's even another huge room downstairs with a full bar that could easily hold 60 people. Would be a great place for a friends and family get-together or celebration.  The food is pretty tasty. I ordered the Wonton nachos with chorizo, cheese sauce, salsa, picked jalapeños, and cream. The portion was tiny, but it was delicious and was $5. My friend had the chicken wings brined and fried and the friggin' chicken wing was massive - could have been a prehistoric bird you'd see at the ROM!  We arrived at around maybe midnight and was lucky enough to catch a table. But the place seemed packed already. As for the crowd, there's a good mix of guys and gals there, and the noise was a bit loud, but hey, it's a sports bar.  Pro tip: Look no further, this is the best sports bar near Ossington and Dundas."}
{"text":"Great spot for a few beers. The food portions are large and the price is quite good. The wanton nachos are great, and so are the wings! Will be back again."}
{"text":"A very fun, very open hipster sports bar (I didn't know that was a thing).  There is a Foosball and pool table (for a dollar a game) and shuffleboard table at the very back along with a maddeningly impossible pinball game from what I would have to guess would be the 1940s. The drinks are very reasonable and the tables are long and set up for groups.  A fun spot with a lot going on even if you aren't watching a game."}
{"text":"Great for sports and has a great vibe.  The staff are super cool and attentive even during the busier times..."}
{"text":"I came here for opening night with some men who were obsessing over their Lulu scores. The conversations were so silly I hardly had time to realize it was a sports bar, and for my money that's a good thing.   Yes there are screens, yes there are sports, but overall this is just a great bar experience. Casual cafeteria style tables, reasonably priced whiskey, and really good fried chicken burgers. They taste like KFC big crunches, allegedly, and apparently that ain't bad!  PEPPER PROPS to this place's namesake. Dude pitched a no hitter on acid.   #obsessedwithhismom #hashtag"}
{"text":"Visited the bar for the first time this past saturday, and I'd say my overall impression was...'Meh'. It was a busy night because the Jays were playing and the bar was streaming the game. Kinda annoying cause their TVs are all really small and if you were not there early enough to grab a seat, you're out of luck. No one really mingled around. Just a bunch of hipster dudes talking to each other. The lighting in the place made it look kinda like a old legion. Granted perhaps this is the look they are going for.  One great thing is the drinks were cheap.  I'd probably go again, but wouldn't rush to head there on a night out."}
{"text":"When I found this place on Yelp, I knew I had to stop in while visiting Toronto based on the name alone (non-baseball fans, look up \"Dock Ellis no hitter\").   This is a great spot. There are plenty of tables if you want to sit and eat, plus a smaller bar and a pool table in the back. There are also couches and chairs near the entrance.   I came in for dinner and got the fried chicken sandwich, Korean style. It had kimchi that wasn't super hot, but had a decent spice. After the first bite I knew this was the best fried chicken sandwich I had ever had. The chicken had a delicious breading and was perfectly crispy. The toppings and sauces were the perfect complements. Even the roll tasted great.   Service was fast and the staff was really down to earth and friendly. This is going to be my go-to spot when I'm in Toronto!"}
