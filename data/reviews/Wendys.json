{"text":"I don't expect to get cold food when I order food to go.  I have a feeling if we had dined at the Wendy's  it still would have been cold.  When I called when getting home the manager said sometimes the food is cold if they get backed up.  That is no excuse.  It just so happens we were the only order posted.  Therefore they were not backed up.

I use to stop at Wendy's because I thought they were a better than average fast food.  That is not true."}
{"text":"There wasnt even a page for this Wendy's for some reason, so I went ahead and made one so everyone else can know how terrible this location is. I went on a Sunday so they were pretty slow as far as customers go. The staff seemed pretty easily confused. They didnt mess up our order, but they were out of all carbonated drinks and had no baked potatoes. The beans in the chili were undercooked and pretty crunchy. Sanitation score was also a 94.5, which seems pretty low to me. Overall, unless I am starving to death...I probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Love Wendy's new salads and burgers. This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean. I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite."}
{"text":"Worst wendys I have ever been to. Last 10 times I've came here they have gotten my order right twice. Tried to walk in at 9:30 and the door was locked and the lobby closes at 10. Food was always subpar to any other wendys. Best word to describe this place is garbage."}
{"text":"Dry burger with very little toppings. 1 slice of tomato, 1 leaf of lettuce, 1 ring of onion, and a dab of mayo and ketchup. I'll find a different Wendy's next time."}
{"text":"Fast service, and clean facilities. Food was hot and tasted fresh. Nice to be able to eat and get back on the road in no time. Thank you Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Every time we give this place a chance and come here we are utterly disappointed! The staff is very unprofessional. Train your staff in customer service please! There are MANY restaurants for which to choose in this area so when we choose Wendy's we should get professional, fast service. Not unprofessional, rude, slow service. People value their time and money and this is clearly something Wendy's doesn't value. Feel like a waste of time and money. We will not come here again. Get it together."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice looking new building. My kids also enjoyed the float. It's nice to have more eating options around this area."}
{"text":"OMGosh!  This place is terrible!!  Horrible customer service (it took us 25 minutes to get our food even though there was only 3 people in line ahead of us!), management and staff does not know what coupons are and how to ring them up (we had coupon to get free Chicken Sandwich when you buy a fries and drink and they insisted it was a coupon for Buy One get One Free - just read the coupon!!!), staff is very rude - are not trained adequately to run the register.  Also we noted that they do not have prices listed on their menu board for drinks - but to get someone to answer the question what the prices are is like pulling teeth!  AND do you know that there is a size smaller that SMALL - apparently at Wendy's there is!!!  Don't be tricked and order a SMALL and extpect that you are getting the Value Menu item - there is an even smaller item that is specifically for the Value Item menu.  So, once you get though the rudeness and being rung up wrong (of course it was to Overcharge!!!) - be prepared to find NO napkins and dirty tables.  Dave Thomas would be rolling over in his grave if he knew what these people were doing to his resturant's reputation!!  We will not be returning to this Wendy's - or any other Wendy's for that matter - they have lost our business for good!!!"}
{"text":"I had a baked potato around noon with a small bacon cheeseburger. The potato was perfect as they always are. The burger was cooked right but not much flavor. If you are from out of town this is always a good place to go eat. The staff is friendly and helpful. The place is clean and modern looking. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I guess if you pay a minimum wage you get minimum quality work...it's time to change the fry oil!! I know fry oil.  My meal had all the correct ingredients ,but the wrong proportions. It not wrong to have pride in a job well done folks. Make it look you like you care. 
The chicken was dry and way too much condiments on my food. Next time I'll visit Jason's Deli or Zaxbys"}
{"text":"Shame on you, Wendy for misleading and false advertising!
Your \"special\" 50 cent Frosty, is no special at all. The TV advertisement shows a full-size Frosty, but what you get is a half the size plastic cup.
You make it look and sound as though I am getting the full-size for only 50 cents.
When in fact, you're getting a small Frosty for $.50.

{"text":"Every time I come to this location, I am highly disappointed. The staff is very unprofessional. I went through the drive through and the young lady that took my order, I could barely hear her. So when i asked her to repeat what she said, she got an attitude with me as if I did something wrong. Let's not talk about the fact that the rating at this place is 95, which I feel is low. When i got to the window, this particular young lady basically threw my bag at me. I knew I should've checked it before leaving but decided not to. When i get back to work, I notice there are no napkins nor any eating utensils in the bag!! So disrespectful!! Every time I come to this location I am always disappointed. Please hire a better staff and prepare them to be professional and to offer excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Twice I have been to this location since it opened because it is close to where I pickup kids.  Both times we were shorted food and 1-3 members of my family had to eat corn dogs.  This time I called and the person I spoke with just said that there was nothing she could do, but give me nuggets next time.  She said \"it's not like I can bring you nuggets...I've never heard of this happening\".  Perhaps it's because of the size of my family; there are eight of us.  They can keep the nuggets, it's to much trouble to do business with a location that can't count.  An apology would have been nice, but was impossible to get."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying....I hate it when people only leave reviews because of a negative experience and therefore because  they're  negative . So, let me start off by saying I have had a positive one. Service is good, employees very respectful. Secondly, food is always fresh and hot. Thirdly, my order has always been accurate.  Moreover, I am grateful that the person working  drive thru speaks English and can accurately place my order. In Conclusion, I  would recommend this place for its fast service, quality, freshness and superb service."}
{"text":"I like Wendy's but this one is no good. The interior is sad and the chicken sandwiches were no good. Clearly, the worst wendy's i have been to."}
{"text":"Witnessed the Manager of Wendy's, Isaiah, abuse a paying customer using vulgar language.
The training processes here at Wendy's must be very low.  The staff was telling the customer to \"come back later, after closing\" - completely instigating violence in this small town.  Police were called

Wrote to Corporate, am not holding my breath regarding a simple reply.
From now on, no more Wendy's for my family and me."}
{"text":"The picture above shows chili at Wendy's at the 303 and Bell road at one inch below the top. When confronting the manager about shorting me so much Chili the manager stated that it was their company policy to fill the chili one inch below the top. I purchased the chili twice and twice it was one inch below which I consider ridiculous. Why make the cup the size it is if your going to fill it half way. 

For three dollars I think Wendy's should fill the cup almost to the top of the size of the cup. If this were the policy then why doesn't this policy apply to a hamburger. Give three quarters of a hamburger and fill the soda cup half way as well. Do everything this way and see how long your in business. 

So Goofy!  Please order more chili and stop half filling your expensive chili. Or make the cup smaller and fill the cup up all the way so people don't feel ripped off."}
{"text":"The new Wendy's sadly couldn't get an order correct if they wanted too, which obviously they don't. Been there several times now and the training their employees receive is greatly lacking. Went across the street to their new competitor on the 1st day they opened and they rocked. Wendy's management needs to step up, train their employees on how to use the equipment to place an order, how to correctly prepare the order, how to check that what they put in the bag is what was ordered and paid for. This place would be a great candidate for an automated ordering process."}
{"text":"Every time my husband goes to this location - our order is wrong. Nothing more frustrating than getting crappy fast food that you didn't order. I asked for a Jr bacon cheeseburger and got a gross cheeseburger with inedible pickles and a pickle end. I wonder if the employees would eat some of the stuff they make for people. So frustrating."}
{"text":"Honestly I'd rather pay more and get a decent burger. Guess that saying you get what you pay for. Returned my cold cheese burger that had a portion of the bun wet. Yes, wet! Was given a new hot cheese burger, but the flavor was old tasting. Just not the way I remember Wendy's to be. Was a time Wendy's was my go to for fast food burgers, not anymore. They have declined, very disappointing"}
{"text":"That cute little redhead with pig tails has remodeled the ol' homestead and it looks terrific.  I would think even Daddy Dave Thomas would agree, Wendy's has grown up and this Nuevo location in the Home Depot parking lot just off of Lake Pleasant Parkway is a great little joint.

I'm always interested in what fast food places are doing to drive sales to the next level.  Taco Bell is the reigning champ in this area but Wendy's new 4 for $4 is a fantastic value.  Choose your \"main course\" (double stack, jr. bacon cheese, etc. and then they add a four piece chicken nugget, drink, and small fries. Perfect size lunch! Although for my tastes, I'm not a big fan of Wendy's fries, would prefer Mickey D's or Freddy's Steakburger (shoestring fries that are the bomb).  But I digress.  Food here is close to the same as every other location and in my book, it's more than passable for a quick Saturday afternoon lunch with the Princess.

This is a brand-spanking new location and they really outdid themselves.  Self-ordering kiosks, upper end soda machine with 30 flavors, quick service.  The seating is somewhat limited like they are expecting lots of drive through traffic and not as many inside orders.  I enjoyed the long, community table (kind of like some Chipotles).  

Overall, nice job Ginger, er, Wendy."}
{"text":"We went to this Wendy's last night and ordered 5 cheddar cheesy burgers and we come home to find that the kitchen people decided to not include our beef patties with our burgers. *see photo* So I went back to Wendy's and talked to the manager and she said \"okay we will remake it\" and she took my food back through the drive thru window which you are not allowed to do because it is a health code violation. Then we get our food back and she did not give us our Large fry because we had to have our fries remade because they were cold and when i told the manager that, she gave me an attitude as if it was my problem that she has lazy kitchen people that night that didn't complete my order correctly or as if i didn't just have to drive back up there to fix THERE mistake and after that as you can see by the photo we receive our french fry not even filled all the way up. This place has really bad service everytime I come there is this rude guy that just shoves your food out the window and says \"here ya go\" and walks away from the window. Everytime I come here I get bad service and I will not be returning to this Wendy's every again."}
{"text":"Great Spicy Chicken Sandwich and fries. Nice and fresh.  Crispy lettuce.  Yum!   Well made food served with a smile.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Just recently stopped off on my way home from work, called mama if she wanted anything for lunch? So she thought be a good idea to get Wendy's.
I ordered Three cheeseburgers, order of chicken nuggets, and two large fries. I had the nuggets, it was ok. Not great? I would rather have them at chick fl'a instead. Girls had no problem mowing down the burgers, including the wife. Fries were actually good, forgot to tell them no salt. But it wasn't that much salt anyways. 
I like how the location use to be a bank, neat how the reconfigured it to make it work. Even though we have tried to stay away from fast foods, Wendy's was a nice change."}
{"text":"New Management., Food is good here and there, Customer Service sucks at drive thru, My drinks are always wrong and they seem not to understand the meaning of \"easy on the ice\"."}
{"text":"Hate to write negative reviews. Fries were undercooked and the burger crap. Cold and Soggy lettuce and tomato. The Wendys on Southern and Signal Butte is the way it should be. Disgusting lunch. Threw the crap away."}
{"text":"I think it's terrible to go get a hamburger and a small fry it's going to cost you almost $7.50 so I had to take off the Frey 550 for a hamburger where is McDonald's"}
{"text":"We went on  Friday and ordered a large fries and Son of baconator. The fries where old barely warm and the cheeseburger was not fresh uncooked either. It is a new facility looks nice but serving old fries and lukewarm burgers is not the way to keep customers coming back. The frosty where tasty."}
{"text":"I really love Wendy's and sign said it's a new location Wendy's has a dedication to freshness of the food. The salad is sometimes not up to par on freshness could use improvement. The people are nice. The place is designed nice and is clean."}
{"text":"Wendy's gets knocked from time to time for rocking square beef patties and flaunting their salads and soups as \"healthy.\" Though I can't really speak to the soups or salads, I'll tell you what I can speak to: frosties. 

Eat a burger, fries and a frosty and tell me you're not satisfied afterwards. Because you'll be lying through your teeth. 

Wendy's is cheap, fast, and if you don't like it, well I guess I just don't believe you."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. 16 min stuck in drive through and once there is a car or two behind you your stuck for the whole crazy trip. 16 min two combos, I left with three large fries and a horrible tasting Chibatta burger, could not eat it. Also ordered a hamburger with no cheese and only ketchup.  I asked them to check to see if it had cheese on it and it did. So they replaced it with a large fries. Stay away. No big deal just pass this place."}
{"text":"Awful! Awful!!!! Ordered a potato with extra sour cream & chives with added onions and the potato was hard as a rock and shad no sour cream at all! My husbands hamburger was suppose to be without cheese and there was  cheese on it! Called the store and the manager hardly spoke English and was extremely rude"}
{"text":"This Wendy's drive through is open late. Like most Wendy's the food is tasty, cheap, and comes out quick. Not much else to say, it is a Wendy's..."}
{"text":"This is a new Wendy's but it is still clean and the service is good, so far it is still in good shape."}
{"text":"I know, it's just Wendys, but I enjoyed the modern decor, self order option and mango peach chiller. The restaurant was clean and the manager was actively making sure customers were happy. Son said his chicken sandwich was average. He liked his strawberry lemonade. My burger and fries met my expectations."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced in my life  !!!  Empty dining room, I'm the only person in line, and the little chatty girls working there,  giggling amongst themselves were too busy to bother with me.  After making a request for service loud enough to hear, they shot me \"go to hell\" looks before resuming their conversation."}
{"text":"Fast enough just doesnt feel like the same selection than the one in Goodyear maybe I'm crazy ..."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  I've tried and tried to like it because it's close to my house, but they have never once gotten our order right, and they burn EVERYTHING.  Tonight was the last time I'll ever have it because after ordering a kid's meal with regular chicken nuggets, they managed to give my toddler burned spicy chicken nuggets with burned french fries.  I understand it's fast food, but it's not THAT difficult.  They just really don't care about the quality of food or the quality of workers.  In an economy like this, I'm sure they could find someone willing to work and do a good job."}
{"text":"We're one of those families trying to cut wayyyyyyyyy back on fast food. But my daughter loves Wendy's. And *sigh* I'm a fan too.

Neither of us eats beef but Wendy's chicken offerings aren't bad. I usually get a grilled chicken something or other. Either the sandwich or one of the smaller wraps. Rarely, I'll get the chicken nuggets.

My daughter loves the spicy nuggets. 

An aside: Not specific to this location but just a comment on the nuggets in general: the spicy nuggets aren't as plump as the regular nuggets. Blehhh.

This location has been clean every time we've visited, which is maybe once a month as we shop the merchants in this area often.

The counter people are usually friendly, especially so on our visit last night."}
{"text":"This Wendy's just opened last week and I live just around the corner, it was my first time visiting and I pulled all the way into the drive thru, it was pretty strange that a worker was standing outside just looking around and after pulling forward he decides to tell me that they are only accepting cash and he made me back up out of the drive thru... making two other cars leave as well. Hopefully they get it together soon."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm here at least 3 times a week and never have any issues.  Food is always fresh n hot n they know me by name.   So I think it's a great location. B"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's guys... It's fast food.

Been through the drive-thru 3 times now and have had no issues. Staff has been friendly, even the time I came through right before closing time.

Folks who complain about Corporate Wendy's advertisements/marketing, post irrelevant photos, or complain about food being salty need to recognize you are eating FAST FOOD. Take your critiques to Ruth's Chris.

Four stars, because I cannot bring myself to rate a fast food place five. I'll be back when I have my greasy food cravings!!!"}
{"text":"We got horrible food from this location and got ill. They would not refund money just wanted to give me gift cards for more food."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the chicken tenders and fries. You could tell the chicken was sitting in the hot basket for way too long. They were tough and dry, probably leftover from the lunch rush. The fries were limp. Disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Went to this location tonight for the first time and I have to say that the service was HORRIBLE! I was in the drive thru line for at least 15 minutes. While driving away, I look into the bag to see the order was wrong! I was not going to go back into that line so I walked inside and the lady tells me (with attitude) \"excuse me we're closed.\" Definitely ruined my night
and  don't plan on eating here again due to the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"They literally got every single part of my order wrong except for the drink.  

I drove through about 15 minutes before close.  Not unreasonably last minute.  But everything looked shut down.  I ordered a burger with no bun because I have a wheat intolerance.  Right away the person taking my order seemed baffled.  \"No fries?\"  \"No, no bun.\"  Ok.  I tried to order a broccoli cheese potato because I know some Wendy's have this or use to have it, but they said they only had sour cream and chive or chili cheese.  No problem, I'll take chili cheese.  Then  a Jr. chocolate frosty.   

The first thing he handed me was the frosty.  It was vanilla.  I had to wait until the order was finished about 5 minutes later before I was able to speak to him again and request a chocolate instead.  Then I glanced in my bag of food and the burger  clearly had a bun.  Okay I can't just remove the bun, because just the contact with the burger is enough for a reaction.  But honestly I was too afraid to ask them to remake it because by this time they were about 5 minutes till close and I was afraid they'd spit in it or something.  I'll just give it to my husband and the potato will be my dinner.  Then I got back to my hotel, got out the potato (with no fork or utensil) and it was a CHIVE potato.  No chili or cheese.  Just a dry potato with chives.  There wasn't even any sour cream on it or in the bag.  Great."}
{"text":"My 7 year old kid says it is a FIVE star experience ONLY because they have the awesome and unique tasting soda options. I say it was TWO stars. Our food was set out on the tray one by one, by one, ultimately waiting on the last item while the rest of our food got COLD!!! 

I do NOT like the modern decor as most of the seating is odd. There were plenty of people there, but none of them sat in the chairs by the fireplace with no tables. No one sat at the communal seating and that took up a good portion of the area. Wait, one guy did sit there in the end all by himself only to stare onto our table and at us!! Weird... Of all of the different seating options, EVERYONE there sat at the standard tables. 

This is a brand new building yet they have a SINGLE bathroom option!!! Hey, if you need to use the restroom or even JUST WASH YOUR HANDS before you eat like I do, I hope it is available!! If my kid needs to use the restroom, one needs to be available NOW, not after waiting for 10 minutes for someone to dump their load!!

The restroom looked like a kid had a hay day in there!! There was toilet paper everywhere and NO paper towels, they were empty!!! The garbage cans were 100% full and 90% full!! It was about 7:30 on a Wednesday evening, not very busy. There were probably 8 to 10 people behind the counter. Surely ONE of them could come out and tidy things up!! 

OH YA, the ketchup dispenser was EMPTY and despite us telling them and asking for ketchup packets, it remained empty until OTHERS complained too!!!

While I realize this is a new location, only open for 5 weeks, there is no excuse for all of these hits against this location!!"}
{"text":"This is the ABSOLUTE worst Wendy's in the entire country. Its dirty inside and out. Not to mention, we have found hair in our food. I cannot believe the owner would allow this place to be this gross. Wonder what the sanitation grade is?"}
{"text":"Remind me to never come back here. The employees are crazy and the customers even crazier. Two stars cause I like the food.

Employee wanted to argue with me about cell phones. Customer wanted to argue with me about the health of beanie wells."}
{"text":"Food wise..I have no complaints. You get what you pay for. Anyways, when I walked into this particular Wendy's, I did not like the fact that the whole floor is sticky. You can hear me walking to the register because that's how dirty that floor is. It makes you think, if the floors are not mopped or cleaned every night, what else is there that they are not cleaning too?  I go to the Northlake Wendy's now, they are more cleaner."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the nicest looking (from the outside, because I have yet to be inside) Wendy's around. The girl at the drive through was really friendly even asking me how my day was going, while we waited for a manager to assist with my order. (I have a discount to use.) Now the manager on the other hand, did not say anything, had a mean look on her face the entire time, and just grunted when she saw my card. I know using a discount can be a hassle, but really you should not be \"mean\" to a customer because they are using something like that. But I have gone off on a tangent. The food was good. Typical Wendy's. I had the Asiago Crispy Club sandwich combo, my husband had the Dave's Double. My girls both had the chicken nuggets kids meal. One opted for fries the other for the apple chunks. I will say I prefer the Wendy's kids meals to other kids meal places. I feel like the apples are fresher and the \"toys\" are normally more geared toward learning or interactive play, which I really appreciate. All in all this is a good Wendy's and I will probably be back."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awful. Food was very cold, the restaurant was dirty and when I had a complaint, the manager Cameron was absolutely rude about it. Do not eat here it is a waste of time and money go to the other location on cactus. I will be talking to corporate about This Location and  hopefully action will be taken to remove the rude people"}
{"text":"It was SO cold today!  So here I was, chillin' like ice in my cube pretending to be hard at work when it struck me.  While my salad in the fridge might be the healthy choice, I was freaking COLD and there was no way I was eating more coldness.  I wanted warm comfort food.  But without the sit down comfort food prices.  

Chili.  

Wendy's has Chili.

For less than $3 and in less than 10 minutes round trip, I had a big thing of chili, an order of chicken nuggets and I was headed back to the office.  

Broke up the crackers, stirred into the chili.  Mmmmm... heaven.  You can get it with extra onions and/or w/ cheese on top.  Small 99cents, large is like $1.75.  

Yea, Wendy's is good for your standard drive through burger stuff too, and I happen to love the heck out of their dollar menu, but nothing beats Chili in the drive through on a cold day!"}
{"text":"This is one of THE WORST Wendy's I've ever encountered.  And sadly IT'S the one closest to my house.
The majority of the employees here (not all, but 8/10 & primarily those that work the night shift) are UNBELIEVABLY INCOMPETENT.  I realize it's a fast food job, but to not give one single S**T about your job.  UNACCEPTABLE.  Inconsistency is a major pet peeve of mine and you never know what you'll get here.  My stories of horrible service, don't-give-a-d*** attitudes, and incomplete / incorrect orders could fill 5 pages of this site so I won't torture you with that (you're welcome)!  :)

Sadly we both crave Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich & find ourselves behind the wheel of the car.  Often times we will end up driving nearly four miles to the Northlake location b/c THEY seem to have their stuff together & are reliable.  We should not have to drive four miles just to ensure we'll receive decent service & correct orders when there is a location less than ONE mile away.  Ugh.  

If you can, save yourself the frustration, and bypass this location altogether.  Choose another option in the area.  Heck, choose Jason's Deli.  It's just a few feet away & to be honest, you won't spend THAT much more, and it's healthier!"}
{"text":"Salty ass fries and poor product of Spice chicken sandwich. Doesn't management ever do quality control? Waste of my money."}
{"text":"I got the snicklefritz French fries and I'm salty about it... 

Don't have an issue with this place. Always has good food and fast service!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this Wendy's for a quick Frosty in the drive-thru! Service was quick and the cashier/associate working the window was friendly. Who doesn't love a frosty? I am team original chocolate flavor!!!"}
