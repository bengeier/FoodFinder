{"text":"Meet Me - Meet is the sister lounge adjacent and attached to The Coup. Whether you're there waiting for your table next door or you've stopped in for drinks, this is a quaint and cozy place with an urban vibe. Just like The Coup, remarkably long and clever drink list, along with a tasty appy vegetarian menu. Great location too. Meet early, because it fills quick."}
{"text":"Being new to town, we had our first date night. Had some awesome recommendations to head down to 17th Ave, so we drove the strip to get our bearings. We walked back up to Meet...  we wanted to go for dinner to Coup, wait time was about an hour. Hostess suggested sitting a the bar along the window which made for some awesome people watching on a Saturday night.

We had drinks... server made some great recommendations, though she brought out the wrong beer. Without us even commenting, she realized and brought out the right one right away. I had an amazing drink called the Snoop Dog (not sure why) - fresh fennel, celery & apple (I think) with gin. So awesome & very refreshing. We had some appies that were pretty good. Service was a little slow so hunker down & enjoy the scene. DJ mixing music on site, but a little too loud and made it tough to chat. Overall - really good place & we'll go back again."}

{"text":"Superb and creative drink concoctions served by friendly and knowledgeable staff.  The \"pimp iced tea,\" which has mint tea, cucumber, lemon, ginger ale, Cointreau and Pimms, was delightfully refreshing.  The atmosphere is very inviting and upbeat."}

I really like that the Coup has Meet. It's often so busy for dinner there is an hour wait. So instead of waiting outside in the cold you can go beside to Meet and get a drink and appetizers while you wait. 

Often times we get seated just after we finish our appetizer so it's perfect. They have several different menu items on their appetizer menu than in the restaurant so not everything is the same. 

We tried The Road Trip which is a large sampler platter of olives, eggplant sleeping bags (served cold), sunflower carrot seaweed pate, zatar humus, cucumbers and corn chips.  It's quite enough for 2-4 people to share. 

The appetizers are also really gluten free friendly and vegan friendly. They have changed the menu since I visited a few years ago, and I like it much better now. 

For a small appetizer I recommend the yam fries. I do wish the miso gravy was a bit thinner like a gravy instead of a thick hummus like dip. It's also a little pricy at $2 a dip."}
