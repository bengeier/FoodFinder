{"text":"The pizza is really good. Really cheesy! I always Get the lunch menu because it's a really good portion of food and the price is better!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Az! I ordered a large pineapple pizza, it was so cheesy and delicious. The portion size of the slices are big enough to share with the family. Also, let's talk about how great the ranch is I mean definitely made with love.  I also had some hot wings ... boy were they spicy but made to perfection. The staff was really friendly as well, highly recommend this location if you are craving the best cheesiest pizza in town!"}
