{"text":"This got to be one the best halal chicken sandwich I ever ate in US and Canada. Guy actually had a grill in the back. He starts grilling once you place your order. It take abt 10 mins but you get one of the best moist chicken sandwich ever. This was one lunch which justified trip to Canada in a big way ! Wish there was a way I could post the pic ..."}
{"text":"The guy who works here is super friendly.  I don't even come here that often, but the owner takes the time to chat while I wait for my food (it usually takes a bit--because there's not much traffic up here, they usually don't have anything pre-made).  The last time, he gave me a scoop of mashed potatoes alongside my sandwich--kind of random, but I'm not one to argue with free carbs!  The food's on par with the rest of the food court, but it gets points for freshness."}
{"text":"As the only halal deli in Toronto (that I know of) I was so excited to go here when I made a trip to Harbourfront. Located in the QQ terminal building was the deli that I expected to be a restaurant but was actually part of the food court on the second floor. The small asian woman was so kind and explained some of the things on the menu that I wanted to try and then Adil (I think this is the nice man everyone is referring to) came and told me to try the roast beef dinner, which I did. I chose salad and mashed potatoes as my two sides and the dressing on my salad was a balsamic vinaigrette that was made IN HOUSE. My friend bought the herb chicken dinner with rice and pasta. We were speaking to Adil the whole time and when he rang us up he offered us free drinks! Their customer service gets an A+ not just because of the free drinks but because they were so friendly the whole time. We got our food and sat outside and it was SO good. The roast beef was so soft and tender and their balsamic vinaigrette was so yummy! The herb chicken was also really good and flavourful. I will definitely be returning to try some other things on the menu after Ramadan and the view doesn't hurt :)"}
{"text":"I've worked in the building for the last 3 years and I have only in the last 2 weeks actually bought food from Pumpernickel's Deli.  I had always viewed the food as pricey and avoided the location.

However, recently i began to go to this location.  I am a big fan of the chicken dinner (chicken leg, salad and rice) as my go to that spans time and places around the world.  How can you do it wrong, and if you do, how can you still be in business???

Their food is always grilled so its always hot and a little crispy. Their chicken had a completely different taste (GOOD!) and their wild rice is...amazing..whatever the spices...they are good.

I will boldly contest bold c --couldnt resist!-- and say that their food is prepared daily and I have been told it is fresh.  Last summer I had quiet a few 4am visits to the office and the only other person I ever saw in the building was the blonde lady (owner/chef?) at the pumpernickel, toiling away!  So either she was putting out the old sandwiches or making them fresh and the times I forgot my passcard and had to go work at the food court, she was making sandwiches....

Regardless if fresh is what you want to be 100% sure of, stick to the dinners as they go very quickly and the individual components of the meal are replenished daily!

The staff is really friendly too.  The other chef/owner heard me the first time my friend coerced me to check this place out and gave me free water and tried to give me recommendations on what to try.  The second time, the girl who helps serve struck up conversation, remembering my last convo with the chef/owner and even offered me spicy ketchup (their own internal mix they use on the food when they eat it) to spice up my chicken dinner...its the little things that count right (especially for another staff member to just remember me)!  

So the price seems high but the food is good and the people are great and they are small business owners who put their heart and soul into everyday giving us a decent meal (albeit quick) in our business schedules.

I'm all for pumpernickel and am excited to start venturing away from my chicken dinners and try their salmon!?! and pulled pork !"}
{"text":"Its really sad when a business does not care about customer service but Im glad there's something called options so I took my business elsewhere. Back story : I went to this location with the desire to  order 2 eggs , bacon and toast. I started to ask for 2 eggs not completing my order and was abruptly told that was not an option because their menu changed and they didnt have just eggs on their Point of Sales Machine. Thats actually not what I wanted but ok . Ive worked in retail previously as well as the food industry so Im well informed of sales. I asked for clarification and was told that was not option. So before I could complete my order. I left and went to another breakfast place that was more accomdating and patient."}
{"text":"I've been getting lunch here at least once a week for the last 6 months (I'm currently on contract across the street and will be sad to leave it when my contract is up!).
For anyone who likes to eat fresh and healthy, this place is great! Their salads could be considered to be a tad pricey (medium is about $8), but you can choose as many selections as you want, and the servers cram in as much as is physically possible, so I'd say that the value for money is quite good. Also, they just started a stamp card which you can have stamped when you order a salad with protein (chicken, fish, falafel etc.), I'm not sure how many you need for a free one but I think it's between 7 and 10. 
Everything is homemade and you can taste it. I had the olive stuffed chicken breast once and it really was delicious. Also, the chicken pot pie is REALLY good. The favourite for the not-so-health-conscious, seems to be the schnitzel on a big white bun, as I see them sell at least 5 in just the time it takes for my salad to be made and the roast beef always looks so good but I have yet to try it out. I stick to my go-to, almost every day for lunch, which is just a straight up salad with spinach, kale, chick peas, red beans, coleslaw, barley, beets, broccoli and quinoa (told you, as many selections as you want!). The quality is consistent, I've never even seen a wilted leaf, and it fills me up til dinner. Also, the owner (I think?), is always on duty, works each station and continually monitors and checks for ways to stay fresh and provide good service. It definitely makes a difference. 
On that note, the line up can seem a bit hectic if you're a first timer, as you need to stand in a certain place for certain orders. On the far left you line up for salads (including salads with meat), in the middle, you line up for sandwiches and daily specials, and you just head straight to the cash for soups or desserts (great cookie selection btw).
I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place for their variety and options for healthy foods.  Usually I always get their power breakfast which they serve until 11am.  It comes with eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, and potatoe wedges all for $5.50 plus tax.  For lunch I usually have Salmon with steamed mushrooms and veggies. Their pasta salad is delicious and super good!  They have a ton of other items from sandwiches, meatloaf, chicken, soups, bagels, and even Montreal Smoked meat.

Lunch will usually cost an average of $10 or more but this place is usually always consistent! Great place to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"To say the food is bad is an understatement, to call it food is only a technicality because long time ago, the ingredients that made up of these things were once fresh. You can only display a piece of overcooked salmon so many times in salad bar after multiple cycles of refrigeration before you toss it out like the rest of the trash they sell here. They pride themselves as the only 1 of 4 food places in this sad office building, the other 3 have the same things going for them. Anything beyond is asking too much for a 15 dollar salad. 

Also if you are like me, who want to eat something hot, or even warm for lunch, then don't bother, as 90% of their items are cold. Cold salmon, cold scrambled eggs (lol really?), cold sandwiches you wish you had made the night before so you don't spend 15 bucks on a small portion of regret. 

Be observant, the people lining up do not have joy on their faces as they just going through the motions of ordering, paying, eating, regretting all in that order. It is a must try! Or you really haven't lived in this depressing part of North York."}
{"text":"For an office lunch, it'll do in a pinch.  I go here about once a month because I find myself craving their salads.  But I always regret it after the fact!?!  I'm not sure why.  Staff is always friendly, generous portion sizes, and reasonably priced.  But there's still a \"but\".  Like I said, it'll do in a pinch."}
{"text":"I think I've just found my new place for salads!!

Of all the restaurants in the concourse that have a salad bar, Pumpernickel's definitely gives you more bang for your buck!

A small salad is $2.99 and not only do they really pack it into the container but you also have the choice of whatever salad or combination of salads you'd like!

This time I opted for the pasta salad and the tofu salad both of which were delicious but I think the tofu salad is my new favourite! Delish!

I don't know why it's taken me so long to try Pumpernickel's but now that I have, I will definitely be back... and soon!"}
{"text":"Decide to try this place out for breakfast seemed liked the best choice in the food court. I ordered the power set it comes with 2 eggs done to your liking bacon sausage toast and potatoes. For 6.50 I also got a small orange juice which brought my bill to 10$ ..... 

The eggs were flavorless and so was the sausage the bacon and toast were good the potatoes were average I doubt I would ever go back . 

I was full but McDonald would of tasted better"}
{"text":"The focaccia panini sandwiches looked good, but tasted pretty bad, they were still cold even after they ran it thru the panini press. I think they were pre-made and didn't taste fresh at all. Skip this place and get a hot burger next door."}
