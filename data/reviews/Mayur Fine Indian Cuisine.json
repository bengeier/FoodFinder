{"text":"Good AYCE lunch!! Price is not bad either. Not too much selection of food but what they have is enough to indulge your cravings for Indian lunch buffet! This used to be a thai place if i remember correctly."}
{"text":"Great deal for lunch buffet. Not spicy. Tandoori chicken - juicy and succulent, the best dish here Paneer saag - very good Butter chicken - very good Lentils - very good Veggie Pakoras - very good Naan bread - very good, baked fresh Rice - very good Vanilla ice cream - very good Everything else was ok. Mango lassi - weird taste, too sour. Mango beer \"Cheetah\" was ok."}
{"text":"We did the pack to go over here. The food was average and so was the service. The restaurant was completely empty at the time we went which was over the weekend at dinner time. One could give it a try but if skipped one would not really miss out on much. With nothing in sight it's a place one could have a meal here."}
{"text":"Got take out from here. Naan was quite good; soft and tasty. The butter chicken was ok but the entree was mostly curry; there was very little chicken. The kheer was good too but it could have been sweeter. Overall though, it was pretty good"}
{"text":"Delicious selection of north Indian foods. I have been only to the lunch buffet, (twice), and it was an absolute treat. The selection of vegetable options changed the two times I went, so it is really interesting to see the variety. My favourite dishes were the herby saag paneer and flavourful goat curry. Service is very attentive."}
{"text":"We always used to order from this restaurant through uber eats but last night I decided to call the restaurant to order and a young woman answered. She asked for all my information regarding home address and phone number, took down my order and said the total amount that it will cost and then proceeded to tell me the food will be delivered to me in an hour. An hour goes by and I call her back and she says she never put the order through because i didn't tell her what I wanted and the phone cut off as I was giving her my phone number. Then after she said she called me back which she never did and apparently a man answered saying wrong number. I would understand if she just simply forgot to give the order to the cook as that may be an HONEST mistake but she kept lying saying she never took my order, I didn't give her my phone number or address or even the order itself. I find this ridiculous because she gave me the exact TOTAL AMOUNT for the food. How would I know the total amount if she \"didn't even take my order down\". This is the worst customer service ever, she needs to be checked for her problematic attitude. At least acknowledge you made a mistake! Perfect customer service if what you're looking for is to drive people away! So disappointing, was a regular but this is just the most outrageous crap ever."}
{"text":"Best Tandoori chicken on whole of Toronto and gta. And I work in Brampton which is the haven of Indian food.  The entire buffet was absolutely delicious. Great variety, very tasty and superb value for money. The ambience also is pretty nice. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Worst food ever , ordered veg jalfrazi and roti the quantity of food they give for 26 $ was as if we were eating on street , i would give a beggar much better food than what i ate today , roti was burned as hell felt like throwing everything on chefs face if you want to save your money and time please abiid this restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after reading the Yelp reviews. We came for dinner and was not not disappointed. The staff are very nice and courteous. Very good customer service. For example,  they noticed that we liked the green chutney sauce and gave us more without asking; the server noticed the spice was making me sweat (in a good way) and gave me a glass of ice. Little things like that go a long way. We ordered the fish amritsari for an appetizer and it was amazing. The fish was substantial and the seasoning divine. For the main course, we got their butter chicken, chicken Tikka, saffron basmati rice, and cheese Naan. All excellent! The chicken Tikka was the best we've had. The butter chicken was delicious. The cheese Naan to die for, especially when we dipped it in the green chutney. The rice was so tasty and fluffy. For dessert, we got their rasmalai, which is like a cheesecake without the crust. I've never tried it before, but it was very good as well. Overall, I would recommend coming here. We are definitely going to try their lunch buffet soon. Finally found a great Indian restaurant in the area that has great food and great customer service, all at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Whoooooh! Spicy! Love it.   Just ordered from these guys. They came sooner than expected, price was fair and quality is good.  Good spice, good flavour.  My friend and I got the butter chicken and beef vindaloo, with orders garlic and butter naan.  The naan is so soft and delicous, and mixes well with the sauce.  Portions are good.  They deliver.  This place is definitely worth a try.  I'm ordering from here again - one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I tried their chicken pakora. They were basically chicken nuggets fried in an Indian spiced batter. The chicken was overcooked and tough. It seems the chef doesn't know to cook chicken breast. Their description of \"tenderly cooked\" isn't entirely accurate. Their food is in my opinion, highly overpriced.   $10.95 for dal? $15.95 for biryani? Even the most lavish restaurants don't charge near as much. I have had much larger pieces of tandoori chicken breast, truly prepared tenderly, that cost about the same or less than these greasy versions of chicken nuggets. I have also had chicken pakora from other restaurants that are better prepared, more flavourful, and not nearly as greasy, in this same neighbourhood.  Their response was to argumentatively try to justify the price by telling me that the special spices make the food that expensive, as if they were introducing a new taste to an unfamiliar and uninformed people, who had never had Indian food before. After that, I did not care to discuss the food quality with them. There are several GOOD Indian restaurants that I have frequented in the neighborhood that have food that is far superior in preparation and taste, and that are not haughty.  I shall not be eating there again."}
{"text":"I got the Butter Chicken delivered with UberEats, just to try it out. It was spicy! I have never had spicy Butter Chicken before, but this was a welcome change! I think there were chopped up chilies inside. It was very good. I asked for no coriander and they accommodated. I'm looking forward to trying their other meals."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service..  This is a new place that I want to stay open. Some of the best Indian food I've had yet!"}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up, I have been eyeing it every time I've driven by. I finally decided to give the place a try!  The outside is in a little bit of a rundown plaza but in the inside it's pretty typical restaurant style. The inside isn't anything to write home about.We ordered straight off the menu but they do offer a lunch buffet!   I ended up starting off with the chicken 65. It was different in an undecided if I like it way. The previous chicken 65's in other restaurants I've eaten have always been fried in a way. The chicken here was sauced up. Granted the sauce was alright but it's the one thing I wouldn't order again.  Onto the main courses! My husband ordered the butter chicken and naan while I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo with saffron rice. All these dishes were scrumptious! The serving sizes here are pretty reasonable.  I ended up with leftovers for the next day and you know what? It was still delicious!  Final verdict? I would come here again maybe even take part in the discount on take out services their take out menu says. I mean 10% is 10% right?"}
{"text":"Food is not fresh, most of the meat are old. All other foods were too much oil. Roti was good. Desserts was good conpared to food. Upset overall."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last night with my beautiful new fianc√©.  Indian is her favourite food and she certainly wasn't disappointed. I have had Indian food about 20 times in my life and this was by far the best.  I read the reviews on yelp before going there and got a good sense of the detail and effort that goes into making every dish there.   I didn't know the significance of things like: \"all the butter chicken is created using tandoori chicken\" but the staff members sure explained it to us.  Each week they use close to 1000 pounds of tomatoes to prepare the various sauces that go into these delicious meals.  Everything about the restaurant was amazing. M"}
{"text":"Went here for a casual Sunday dinner. The food was good although the portions were really small. However, we ordered 1 naan and 1 rice and 2 curries and we were both full. The butter chicken was good. Friendly service and the price is $$ - $14 for a small bowl of curry.   The lunch buffet here is $12.99 and I think the quality of food is the same. Hence the 3 star. We were expecting more flavour or better taste for the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I'd been eyeing this place since before they opened, and I finally got to try it out! My mother and aunt had been here for their lunch buffet when the price was still $9.99 on weekdays, and my mother said it was good, so I knew it was on my to-try list.  We got there at about 12pm, and there were no other customers in the restaurant. That sent up warning signals everywhere. However, service was attentive and friendly, so we stayed and we went to get food from the buffet. I'm glad we did. The food is fresh and hot and delicious.   Highlights:  Saag paneer - spinach and cheese curry. I'm a sucker for a good saag paneer. This one was mildly spicy, and may have been my favorite dish at Mayur.  Butter chicken - I appreciate it when a buffet still takes the time to use tandoori chicken in their butter chicken. I could definitely taste the BBQ flavor of the chicken. Something seemed a tad off about the butter chicken sauce though. It was a tad too...bright? It lacked a flavor depth I was looking for. This is my opinion though. My friend loved it.  Goat curry - so flavorful. So tender. So good. Not too spicy.  Yogurt - Cuz yogurt takes the edge off of spicy food. One of my friends was worried about the spice, and one of the waitresses was nice enough to recommend that she have the yogurt with her food, and then even walked her to where the yogurt was so she could get some. It worked!  Naan - Served in a basket. Hot from the kitchen. Bottom is thin and crispy. Top has lovely air pockets and is soft and fluffy. I used more naan to scoop up all the sauce on my plate than I probably should have eaten in one serving.  There are a bunch of chutneys and sauces I didn't try, but they all looked good too.  Very good for the price. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"We found this lovely restaurant through a quick yelp search.  Absolutely delightful.   Our two kids (who are not spice lovers) both are sure it's the best Indian restaurant they've ever been to.   We found the depth and richness of the flavours surpassed most Indian food we've eaten out in Canada.   We enjoyed the lababdar chicken and jalfrezi as well as the daal makhani.    Perfectly spiced, rich, vegetables cooked just to perfection:   The garlic naan was so flakey and light.   The service was phenomenal, friendly, good recommendations, liberal water top ups. Love this place and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time for lunch today, buffet was $11.99. The restaurant itself is cozy and clean and the buffet table is at the front. Washrooms are decent. Started off with some basmati, butter chicken, onion bhaji (very nice), saag paneer and tandoori chicken. All were ok except for the tandoori chicken which was kind of overdone and a bit dry. Meat in the butter chicken was similar. The waiter came by with fresh naan when I was almost finished my first plate. It was good; hot, a little crispy and not oily. Next I tried the goat curry which was very nice. Finished off with some gulab jamun and ice-cream, very good! Not the best I've had but still a solid place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times for the lunch buffet. Delicious every time. The food tastes great and it's only $10. It's the right combination of price and quality. I'll definitely be back.  Ps. Spoke too soon. Their buffet price is now $11."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I can't believe I waited this long to try this restaurant! The food was fantastic and well priced ($9.99 for lunch buffet!), the place was very clean and the service was great, they even gave us complimentary mango lassis because they recognized my sister who is a regular. We took our parents for the lunch buffet and it turned out to be perfect for what we all wanted. Even my mom who usually eats like a bird was pleased. We were all impressed. Really, really nice people running it! I've been telling my friends to check this place out since then. I definitely recommend trying this place if you're in the mood for Indian food!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best Indian food I've had! Great value for the price!  It was our first time ordering from here so we stuck to our favourite items: garlic naan, butter chicken, and basmati rice. We did pick up. At first we were a bit annoyed about the $5 price tag for the naan but it was HUGE we shared one between two people comfortably. Everything was delicious and filled to the rim! Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through Yelp and tried it out for dinner. The owners (I think) are from a Nepal as you see a few pictures and artifacts from the country. We ordered Daal Maakhni, Veggie Biryani, lamb and Nanna. The preparations were good although I have tasted better biryanis elsewhere. The lamb was pretty good but made spicy inspite of asking it to be mad mild. Naan was bit oily. The host were nice. Washrooms were clean. Overall, a decent place"}
{"text":"I have eaten the buffet at this restaurant a few times and it is quite good, so  I took a group there last Friday. Taj the owner's son-in-law is very accommodating and was helpful in choosing a menu for my group. The staff were excellent, as was the service, they are very attentive to your needs. And for those of you who have issues with the cleanliness of a restaurant, this place is VERY clean! But the most important thing is the food was EXCELLENT. I find some Indian food has too strong a curry flavor in it and you don't taste anything else, but the food at this restaurant has a more balanced flavor and you can taste the different seasonings in it and is more subtle set of flavors in there food. They can also tailor how spicy the food will be for you as well if you wish. My group all were quite impressed with the food and the restaurant in general and asked if I would schedule another dinner there, which I will. I would VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant."}
{"text":"My lunch buddy, Raj, had a craving for Indian food, buffet style. We like trying different restaurants, so a search through Yelp, Google, and other social media produced a short list within a reasonable proximity. We decided on Mayur Fine Indian Cuisine at Ellesmere and Pharmacy, in Scarborough.  Mayur is located in an older plaza with several other restaurants, including Hakka Chinese, Sushi, and Pizza. The parking lot is pretty tight, with very few spots, compared to the potential seating in all the restaurants. The buffet is located near the entrance, making it easy to decide if it's appealing enough to stay for lunch.  The steam table had fifteen items, including the always popular butter chicken, tandoori chicken, curry goat, chickpeas, saag paneer, and more. There was a handwritten sign at one end of the buffet that said something about \"love food\", \"don't waste it\", or something like that. That explains the size of the small plates. I have no problems with the message. I hate to see food go to waste. I would have preferred a larger plate.  The food tasted good. I particularly liked the butter chicken, curry goat, and saag paneer (spinach and cheese). The veggie pakora and onion bhaji were just slightly on the dry side. I imagine they would have been much better if they had just come out of the kitchen. The rest of the food was very good. My grumpy friend wasn't so enthusiastic. Did I mention he was grumpy?   For the second day in a row, a server spilled something on me and all over the table. This time, it was a bottle of beer. At least she was genuinely apologetic, a bit embarrassed, and made a good effort to clean up the mess, unlike last night. She did bring a new bottle of beer but she forgot a water glass.  As we became more aware of our environment, we realized none of the lights in the restaurant were turned on. There was a lot of light coming in through the front windows but the back of the room was kinda dark. It made table-side photography a little bit more challenging. I think they also forgot to turn on the air conditioning. I was sweating a lot! The heat from the steam table didn't help. Maybe they turned off the lights to lower the heat. Their debit/credit terminal wasn't working, making cash the only payment they could accept.  The food deserves a higher rating but the issues mentioned above were too much to ignore."}
{"text":"I had a craving for indian food one day and called in to order. Their delivery guy was away so had to drive in to pick up.  Veggie samosas are giant but tasty Garlic naan: good Butter chicken was good. It is a bit spicy, but I liked it. If you are not expecting any spiciness in your butter chicken this is a heads up Saag paneer; good Goat curry: too many bones and the sauce very oily, would not order again Mango lassi: didn't taste right, would not order again  Overall food was fine but would not go out of the way to pick up food there. Perhaps lunch buffet is a better value, or when their delivery guy is working  Also when picking up order not a singled napkin or utensil was in the bag, so make sure to ask them if it's necessary"}
{"text":"I have to say I've had some trouble finding a place that has Indian food to my taste in Toronto but lo and behold this place is almost on my doorstep and it is good. Very good. I went with a party of seven so got to try a number of different dishes and none disappointed. My own meal of Lamb Vindaloo was excellently spiced with just the right amount of lingering heat without being crazy.  The servers were all friendly and person looking after our orders was super friendly and helpful despite some members of our group being picky eaters with a hundred questions about the dishes (honestly sometimes I want to slap them).  It would easily and deservedly have earned 5 stars for that experience but I feel compelled to drop a star because the lunchtime buffet experience (which I tried first) was not of the same quality. Don't get me wrong, the food was good enough that I organized the dinner, the staff were friendly but the buffet plates were just too damn small and I wasn't invited to make more than one trip... so for the money I didn't think the lunchtime buffet was worth it - I'll certainly go again but it will be a la carte all the way."}
{"text":"Its located on ellesmere rd and pharmacy ave. In a small strip plaza facing staples. Yes they have good parking space and its not a very busy or crowded place. I went with my family and didn't know they only serve buffet in the afternoon. We gave it a try and trust me its a never ending experience. Yes do I prefer to go back yes i will. The food was amazing. Lets talk about the food now, they have limited choices for food but its 13$approx. The good part is they bake fresh naan its not precooked. They also have LLBO section for those who want quench their thirst. In nutshell it is worth going their .."}
{"text":"Very disgusting.. I was told by the waitress that is fresh food, everything is made in the spot. Came up to be dated food, frozen chicken, the food was cold, externally bad.   I would only recommend it you want to hate Indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent! Chicken Tikka (sizzler) was amazing--perfectly seasoned and tender chicken breast. Butter chicken was one of the best I've had...sauce was really flavorful and not oily like it can be from other places I've had. Both dishes were medium spicy. Butter naan was also excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Got food yesterday as take out... rotis were like rubber and not the typical Indian Rotis. The sides were bad and expensive for the quantity. Further next morning the sides had gone bad even after Putting them in fridge. I am worried how many old days food they gave me.  Would never recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Did take out.  Pretty good! Naan was very buttery and fresh. Authentic flavours. Had butter chicken (7/10), jalfrazi chicken (7/10) and lamb (9/10). Good pekoras too. I will dine there in person next time to get a better sense of how clean the place is."}
{"text":"Buffet style with indian music. Liked the tandoori chicken and the naan. Didn't like the mango lassi but everything else is good. Some of the food is mildly spicy and parking is ok but is shared with other food places."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Very quiet atmosphere. The owner was very accommodating and informative. The butter chicken (mild) was off the charts! The chicken tikka masala had just enough spice! We had both over basmati rice which was perfect. The rice pudding for dessert and chai tea topped of a great meal! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Waiting staff is very polite as well. Prices are decent. Overall it was a good experience. I can't wait to taste their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"The food and the service are both excellent. We got the butter chicken and lamb biryani with raita which were all amazing!!! The butter naan is a must have! I highly recommend this place !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is damn good. Living in Toronto, Chicago and Houston, I've had my fair share of Indian food, but this place is one of the best. The restaurant itself is very nicely laid out and super classy and upscale. The food though is sooo legit, like food coma good. We had the yellow daal, eggplant, saag, bindi and balls of potato and everything was so delicious. The rice is also really good..coming from someone who doesn't really like rice. If you're looking for some legit Indian food, I would highly recommend coming here..it's worth the drive to b-town! Will be back very soon."}
