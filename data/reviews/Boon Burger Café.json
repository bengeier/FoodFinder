{"text":"Finally, a place where vegans and vegetarians can flock to in the west end of Toronto. I have often driven all the way downtown to hit up places in \"vegandale\" such as Doomies, but finally we have an option! I'm not used to having this many options for fast food, just phenomenal! Spicy burgers, traditional burgers, poutine, hot dogs...and all cruelty free. I am vegetarian and usually am wary of cheese substitutes but whatever Boon Burger Cafe is using was amazing. If I didn't know I seriously would've just thought it was cheese! I had the bacun cheeze burger (yes that's how it's spelled and yes they are super clever at naming their burgers). Also tried the poutine. Everything was wonderful. Bursting with textures and flavors, definitely a messy affair (if you need to be neat, like a first date or something you can order a salad bowl with the burger contents). I love this place and I'll definitely be back. I hope they do well because I love their philosophy to support cruelty free food options."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favourite vegan place, I've been here twice and loved it both times!! Portions are very generous and the food is awesome.   Also love the fact that I don't need to trek to downtown Toronto to enjoy good vegan food."}
{"text":"So happy to have more vegan choices in Oakville!

We ordered the pumpkin soup plus large kale arugula salad as well as the Mexican burger.

The service was really friendly.  Place is small and limited seating.  Quite a few waiting for take out orders.

Food was delicious.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just 2 thumbs up wow!!!  
Went for dinner last night with BF- really nice upon entering- clean, lots of natural light, wood tables and just superbly decorated. 

Menu is printed and u order up front.  This is a 100% vegan menu. I ordered the bacun  boon burger with chilie fries and a beer.  BF has the Buddha burger with plain fries and a beer.  Now this food is not cheap- but that is okay as I feel the quality will be there. They offer us glasses to pour our beers in - nice.  We are given a toy cow.... aaaWww to indicate our order.  

Food took under 15 minutes which I think was very reasonable.  They brought it to 
Our table and it was served in metal trays with paper. 

Mine was super tasty - bun is out of this world. Burger was nice and thick- cheese fries were super yummy! 

His food was interesting and nicely done but I took a quick bite and found I liked mine better - burger is made from various things including chick peas. Mine mostly black bean and other things which was perfect. 

It was nicely filling and I believe fries a baked- not fried- so probably really healthy in that way. 

I absolutely would recommend but I think I will get plain fries as they were so good I think they are perfect as stand alone not dressed.  
So happy a local vegan place has opened and hope they do well."}
{"text":"I visited the Boon Burger location about a year ago and while I liked it, I knew a few things could be improved.  

In terms of the interior, it is very similar to the Burlington location, but a tad smaller. Wooden tables and booths, and a very hipster like vibe.  The girl at the front counter was also friendly and was willing to walk me through the menu and give me her personal recommendation as well.

What's nice about Boon Burger is that it is 100% vegan and they serve drinks.  

I got the Mariachi burger this time and it looks like they've scrapped the square/foccacia bread in favour of a normal burger bun.  It definitely tastes better with the bun and is less messy.  The burger itself was marked with two peppers, but it wasn't that spicy. More of a mild spicy than anything else. I would have this again, except for the fact it was $15. The patty itself was warm, and the ingredients were cold, so overall the burger had a nice cool feel to it. I liked it. Some people may want piping hot. It's at everyone's discretion.

Would I visit again? Sure, but not too often because of the price point. I think they should just make all their burgers $10 and that would entice more people."}

To be honest, I'm one of the last people to really go to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant. I just don't feel the same satisfaction

I ended up picking up the jalape√±o inferno and got the sesame fries and the iced tea for a combo. The burger itself tasted great, the patty itself (a mushroom base patty) was one of the best vegetarian options I've had. One thing I would've preferred would be changing the Frank's to something like a chipotle hot sauce, the smokiness would've blended better with the flavours they had. The vinegar from the Frank's at times overpowered the rest of the burger. 

Ordinarily, based on the burger, I'd probably rate the food higher... But the fries really let me down. The sesame fries were just so dry it was like eating sawdust. The sesame didn't really add anything, and in my opinion took away from the fries. Don't get me wrong, I like sesame and I love fries, just maybe not together. Considering the fries were be, the dryness probably resulted from being baked at too low a temperature for far too long. Essentially, Get the burger, skip the fries.

The iced tea was awesome. It packed a lot of flavour and didn't leave a syrupy after taste like most commercial iced teas. Definitely one of the better iced teas I've had.

The service was great and very polite. Food is made fresh to order but can be a little slow at times. 

The decor is pretty neat and gives off a very hipster-ish vibe. I like the benches and the bench tables. It's like a modernized barn feel.

Valuewise, it's a little pricy to me, $13-15 just for the burger. I can understand the pricing since they're a very unique type of burger shop, but for me I can't justify spending that type of money just for a vegan alternative.

Overall, I'd say this place is a pretty good place to go if you want a vegan alternative for burgers. I might visit again with some of my vegetarian/vegan friends, but probably something I'd actively seek out."}
{"text":"This is the second Boon Burger location I've been to, Burlington being the first. And, as expected, it was just as delicious, hearty, filling and fun as the first time! 

Boon Burger has some of the best vegan burger combos I've ever tried. If you're thinking of checking out Boon but you're not sure, listen to me when I say DO IT!!! You will not be disappointed by their menu options. Alongside having fabulous burgers, Boon also offers nachos, soft serve ice cream, chilli dogs and more. I've been vegan/plant based for almost 10 years and Boon Burger is one of those places that I ALWAYS want to visit and eat at. 

Boon, you have my heart! And my stomach ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but wanted to try this place. The Mexican burger was decent. Not spicy. The buns are heavy duty whole grain and are really filling. The poutine was ok. The regular size is big enough for two to share."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. The staff is very friendly and our food order came quickly. I had the Greek inspired burger which was excellent. The tzatziki sauce worked really well on it. I liked the sesame fries. Overall, the food is excellent, and the ingredients seem very fresh. The only suggestion I would have is to turn the music down a bit (especially outside)."}
{"text":"This veteran Boon customer from the original Boon Burger days in Winnipeg was soooo excited to visit a NEW Boon Burger location yesterday situated in Oakville. Totally impressed with the decor and staff (Amy, Leo and the new staffer). Everyone was enjoying their Boon experience -- the repeat customers and newbies alike. Awesome, imaginative, cutting-edge vegan menu. Something for everyone. Carnists will never be the same again after their first Boon experience. Licensed, and boasts a huge patio. Totally accessible entrance/exit and accessible bathroom (sans harsh chemical inhalants). 

I ordered the \"Not the Same Ol' Poutine\" (PHOTO) which perfectly hit my snacking sweet spot while taking a break from grocery shopping next door at Fortinos. The portions are very generous so bring a sidekick or more to try a few different items if it's your first Virgin Vegan Visit (not to be confused with Richard Branson's company. However Branson has recently invested in a few vegan companies). After your first Boon experience you won't look at vegan food the same way again, even if you have not yet embraced a vegan lifestyle. \"I FEEL GOOD\" -- Boon Burger is great for you, great for the future sustainability of our planet and a lifesaver for the animals. *** \"I'll be back\" to quote a prominent vegan actor and former Governor of CA who is featured in Canadian Vegan Superstar Filmmaker James Cameron's (Terminator, Avatar, Titanic, Aliens) NEW vegan documentary \"The Game Changers\". http://gamechangersmovie.com Boon Burger is a Game Changer -- Boldly Boonalicious!
