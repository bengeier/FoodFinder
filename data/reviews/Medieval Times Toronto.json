{"text":"My bf took me there for my birthday and it was an awesome experience!! The show was amazing and exciting and I was cheering my lungs out for our royal green knight. too bad he got killed in the end, tears*** The trickes they did with horses were just incredible, very dangerous I would think so points to the knights!

since it's dinner and show, so we were servsed 1/2 of chicken (maybe 1/4 but it was huge i think it's 1/2), roasted potatos, piece of rib, soup, garlic bread, pastry dessert... the whole portion can feed me for 3 days. Our waiter was a super nice and hard working guy, so even the flavour was just a soso, the waiter made me think everything was as good as it gets. i might be biased cuz it was a surprise birthday gift so i was happy regardless...."}
{"text":"I took my 5 year old nephew to Medieval Times last night and he had a blast! He got right into the show, cheering at the top of his little lungs for 'our knight' and waving his flag constantly.
The meal is quite reasonable - definitely lots of food. My nephew loved the chicken and thought it was quite fun to eat with his hands. (I took a pack of wet wipes which came in very handy). Server was fantastic.
Definitely recommend Medieval Times for a fun evening out, especially with kids."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have dinner and a show! Very kid friendly and the dinner is pretty good."}
{"text":"Ok, yes, I went here this past weekend.  My brothers and I are all grown up and have separate lives, so we thought it would be a great activity just for us to do.  It is cheesy and yes, the music is very synthesized, but with enough ale (no mulled wine, sigh), it was a time to be had!

I had the veggie option and it was actually quite good.  The meal consisted of: some sort of pita chip and hummus dip, veggie skewers (which included two kind of dry giant potato halves), rice with I think lentils and raisins (it was dark) and marinated mushrooms.  There is a heated apple phyllo pastry for dessert.  It was OK.

A number of people were surprised about the $24 beer because THEY DON\"T TELL YOU what it costs until AFTER they give it to you.  So ya, you get to keep the vessel, but if you want a refill, it's $15.  So you paid $9 for the cup.  My knight was killed first (boo Yellow Knight!!!) but I saw him in the lobby afterwards and told him I was sad he died.  

You need to show up with an open mind and just go with it.  There were a lot of kiddie birthday celebrations, but also bachelor parties, anniversaries and even a guy who asked his girlfriend to marry him right there.

Where else would you get to wear a paper crown that everyone keeps on their heads after the show and on public transit?  Where else could you call your server wench?"}
{"text":"It was a good time! enough food to fill you. a show to keep you entertained. They even assign you into groups will your own champion which gets you involved and interested int the games. The hand to hand combat was my favorite, it all seemed very fluent. some parts like getting knocked off the horse was cheap but over all it was a blast!"}
{"text":"prompt service by my wench. food is pretty decent.
tender roasted chicken, meaty rib, nicely seasoned potato, hearty tomato soup. 

AND you get a show to watch. We had to cheer for the sleazy knight. Oh so sleazy. Oh so good."}
{"text":"Loved the show.  Claire, our server, was good.    Butter tart for dessert was not.  The rest of the food was hot and good.
Was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Loved it! I definitely recommend going here at least once. The show was entertaining. The horses are very well trained. The knights put up a good show. Loved the involvement of the crowd. The servers were friendly and always stayed in character. The food was definitely what you would expect to get in medival times, simple and bland. They started us off with tomato soup with garlic bread. Then followed with the main course of 1/2 roasted chicken, corn and baked potato. For dessert we got butter tart. Oh and yes there's no cutlery given. Use of the good old hands like in the olden days."}
{"text":"It was a nice first experience, crowd was full of energy the waitress was wonderful and attentive. We were, well received. The actors first greet us in the entrance way, we hung out for a bit in the waiting area where they have a bar for drinks, slush for kids, there is a possibility to buy some medieval clothing, and some weaponry takes some pictures etc.. 

The food was okay, the show was okay. I didn't like how they handled the animals, the horse we're being slashed or whipped with this invisible whip I am not sure how they call this tool but even my son (9) noticed the horses having mouths full of drooling saliva, seems due to anxiety, stress. I didn't not like it and felt anxious for the horses. Even the bird was in a very vulnerable state having both legs tied his only option is to land on the ground in the middle of the arena."}
{"text":"I attended the show yesterday for the first time in 12 years and had an unforgettable experience. I enjoyed the knighting ceremony, adorable horses, and falconry very much. The story and tournament were very entertaining, even though my team's knight was slain. I loved how the knights used the different weapons and used some excellent, matrix-like fighting moves. All of the staff were very enthusiastic. I opted for the vegetarian meal, and particularly loved the hummus and pita with veggies, the butter tart, and coffee! Shoutout to our manwench, Dan, for attending to our group's every need, being funny, charismatic, kind, generous, and very much in the medieval spirit. Excellent show and I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Overall, I had a fun time here. It is a fun experience to enjoy once in a while, but don't come expecting some great food. Honestly, the food was decent. I don't think the food was bad although I have heard negative reviews regarding the food here. 

The staff/servers who are responsible for each table is inconsistent. Some may seem really into it and they are very enthusiastic. However, there are some that look tired. But overall, no complaints on the service. 

The crowd was very loud and excited. It is a fun experience to come with a group of friends. I probably won't return anytime soon since I will probably be watching the same show. 

Great to come for celebrations !"}
{"text":"I came here for a masquerade party and boy was I excited! Since this was my first time being at Medieval Times I was incredibly happy to just step inside.

This place is made for magic to happen. I had an amazing time meeting the knights, queens, kings and princesses. The horses are beautiful and so sweet. I got to see everything!!

Needless to say, I will be back for a show with a few friends for sure. =)"}
{"text":"I went as part of a family trip for my nephew's 5th birthday, so we got the Celebration Package, a $16 per person upgrade. Luckily for us, there was a promo code (30VD) that discounted the regular ticket price down to $30, so the packages were $46 per person instead of $51 for children and $80 for adults.

The celebration package includes:

VIP seating (we ended up in the first row)
Group Photo for Each Member of the Party (can be a pain if it's a family trip and you end up with several copies of the same picture)
Commemorative Program (has bios for the knights, etc.)
Knight's Cheering Banner (we didn't get one)
Slice of Birthday Cake for Each Member of the Party (the \"slice\" is a small square with sweet icing and a lone candle, nothing too fancy)
Personalized Announcement During the Show (they announce whatever you told them to say, get the crowd to cheer, no spotlight on you or anything like that)
\"Behind the Scenes\" DVD (one for the group)

In terms of food, there is the standard meal of garlic bread, tomato bisque soup, oven-roasted chicken, one spare rib, herb-basted potato, a pastry, and Pepsi or water. It's a fair amount of food, and all portion sizes are the same whether it's for an adult or child. I had the vegetarian option, and was given a meatless lasagna served with broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots instead of the chicken, spare rib, and potato. Oh, and I got to have utensils, unlike the hoi polloi.

The tomato soup was nothing special, and the garlic bread was quite hard. Dunking it in the soup made it much tastier, I'll admit. The vegetarian lasagna was actually pretty good. My broccoli and cauliflower were snatched up and eaten very quickly before I had a chance to taste them; the carrots were kind of mushy and flavourless. Definitely frozen veggies. According to my family, the chicken was better than it looked, and the spare rib was yummy. I swiped a potato off my sister's plate and maybe it was karmic retribution, but it was salty and a little overdone. I'd be lying if I said I didn't eat the whole thing. The pastry, an apple strudel, was hard and cold by the time it got to us, which made the birthday cake seem much more appealing. Tea or coffee is offered when the meal is finished.

Since we were dining with a soon to be five-year-old, we were offered cranberry or orange juice for him, which was nice since the drink choices are so limited. For the grown ups, you can pre-order alcoholic beverages for your table and there is a cash bar. A bottle of Jackson-Triggs Cabernet ran us $24.

For those with allergies, I would definitely recommend taking medication before attending. The show lasted about 90 minutes, which is just about the point where my nose started to get stuffy despite the allergy meds. It's also not the place to go if you're at all sensitive to noise. They want you to be as loud as possible.

I'd have to recommend skipping the ticket upgrades and saving that money for any souvenirs you might want. Getting the reserved VIP seating somewhere in the first 3 rows is a nice bonus, but if that's your goal, stick to the $10 per person Royalty upgrade since all the other packages have a ton of stuff you won't care about. For regular tickets, seating is first come, first served, so simply arrive early and line up early and you should be set.

On the whole the tickets were a decent value for the discounted price, which after taxes and fees was $220 for a family of 4 (plus $11 for parking). I can't imagine paying $340 for the same experience. Medieval Times is definitely something to experience at least once -- preferably with a coupon."}
{"text":"Enjoyable evening and first time at Medieval Times for our family.  8 and 11 year old thoroughly enjoyed the show.  

We bought the celebration package which got us first row ( it was a slower night) a picture,and a. Few other items you can read on the website.  The kids thought it was awesome to sit up front.

Food- I was not expecting a whole lot but it was actually good.  Chicken was moist, corn was tender, soup was hot... All in all it was a decent meal.  As you know you eat with yer hands, but they do provide you with  a wet nap when your done.

Ambiance- very neat how they set it up.  Cheering for your knight and the theme is pretty good.  

We cabbed it from our hotel and it was an easy in and out.  I saw plenty of parking around the show.

We arrived 60 mins before the show.  They have a large area to walk around and souvenir shop, have a drink, check out the horses etc.. With a group of adults could be fun to hang at the bar before the show.  We were with our kids so we strolled the grounds and walked away with a few souvenirs.

Seating is done by color of yer crown.  Goes in order as blue and yellow are on the far side of arena and green  and red are closest to the entrance.  I don't think that it matters as the action is throughout the entire arena.

The horses were very well trained and the squires, Knights all worked incredibly hard throughout.  You'd think that night after night the might try to \" Mail\" it in but they were very engaged and did some crowd interaction as well.  Well done!

The \"wenches\" or waitstaff were very good.  They hand a tray at the end if you want to tip them.  We did as she was excellent but I'd be interested if everyone did the same...

Afterward if you wait around a bit the Knights do come out for pictures in the main bar-souvenirs area which the kids thought was cool.

Good times and We can say we saw it. I felt we did get our money's worth."}
{"text":"This was our second time coming to Medieval Times. We had a blast! My kids absolutely loved it!

When we arrived, there was quite a long line-up to enter. The line was well-organized though and moved quickly. While we were waiting to enter in for the show, we were entertained by seeing the horses and birds.

We were seated in the Black & White section. The arena is not overly large so we were able to see everything really well. Our server was excellent. She played the part well and was attentive and friendly.  

The performers did a spectacular job. They really put on a great show, especially near the end. It got a bit intense, in a good way! 

As far as the food goes, my kids really liked eating with their hands. They thought that was a lot of fun. They really enjoyed the chicken, corn, and potato. I had the vegetarian meal.  I was served carrot and celery sticks, hummus and pita as a starter. As for my main course, it was a bean stew. I liked how it was presented in a metal bucket. And yes, I did get a spoon. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars was because I didn't find the bean stew very appetizing. I'm sure others might've loved it though. The vegetarian meal they served a few years back had more variety, in my opinion. The butter tarts were good though!

Overall, we had a great time! I would definitely recommend experiencing Medieval Times, especially if you're looking for something a bit different to do with your kids."}
{"text":"Booked our anniversary several weeks in advance. Took the day off work, booked a hotel with no cancellation, only to get an email 2 days before saying the show was cancelled."}
{"text":"They put on an amazing show - the swordfighting was much more energetic than I expected! The only drawback was that there are an awful lot of horses and horse-show  things going on. Probably only fun to go once every few years, but I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had a great time. I went there with my boyfriend.   The portion were generous, but the quality of the food was overall average. The show is quite entertaining. The horses were beautiful and there was a lot of interaction between the actors and the audience. The waitress staff is also very friendly. The kids around us seemed to have lots of fun. There were people of all ages and demographics. 

We used a groupon, not sure if I would have paid full price. 

I disliked the fact that they were trying to up sale you all kinds of trinkets (fake swords, etc...), packaged (ex: birthday package), etc... We did not buy anything, but noted parents around us that bought trinkets for their kids (probably to avoid tantrum). 

In summary, go there fore the ambiance, not so much for the food."}
{"text":"This place has it all!
 
Great food + entertainment!!!

They post the price as $60 something, but there's always groupon/dealfind or on their website for $40 something.

Food

-tomato bisque and garlic bread (amazing)
-a whole chicken leg (yummy)
-some other meat that slipped my mind but yummy (just trust me)
-dessert which was apple pie/turnover (yummy as well, and i got extra!)

Entertainment was good.

I would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Was boring like going to a a grade 6 school play and our server was rude af. For one she offered us water or soda and when I said soda she looked me up and down and said Are you suuurree? wtf is that. unpleasant staff overall and not worth that price per a ticket"}
{"text":"Yesterday my daughter's and I went to Medieval Times for the first time. We were celebrating my eldest daughter's 22nd birthday. Upon entering the building we were greeted by a room that was both cheesy and entertaining. We completely expected cheesy. My daughter commented that it seemed like it was geared more for kids. She was correct. The merchandise for sale was purely for kids. And yet right beside these displays of glowing sticks with bright lights and sparkles was a bar offering equally bright and colourful alcoholic cocktails for the adults. Once they allowed us to enter the arena we were herded to our seats by the staff. We had paid the extra cost to have a front row seat. A serving wench quickly appeared and provided us with non-alcoholic beverages. The show started shortly after. The show was quite good. The horses were definitely the star of the show. The accents adopted by the actors were cute and amusing. The horses performed several different acts including musical rides, horse and rider courses and other challenges. Dinner was served throughout the show and the portions were quite generous. The food was not bad. About the quality of a Swiss Chalet. The most bizzare part of the evening happened when the show turned to battles between knights during which they used several medieval type weapons against each other. Suddenly and sickeningly the crowd around us turned sadistic. The crowd was more excited and enthusiastic about watching two people beating each other than they were about watching the beautiful horses performing. Yikes!! I could only guess what kind of a message was being given to the many children who were in the audience.  It really says something about our society these days. Anyway, brutality aside, overall the evening was fun and my daughter's really enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"A great place for KIDS of all ages ... the food was surprisingly good . my expectation were very low but chicken turned out to be quite tasty .... perhaps the bottle of wine we ordered helped a bit too ;-)  BTW: even though the website and tickets specifically tell you there is no need to come early!"}
{"text":"Mostly tips:

We attended Medieval Times in Toronto with another couple, on a Saturday. We bought our tickets online (you need to pick your date ahead of time) with a Buy one get one free coupon code (available on their website for March).

If you're going to go to the medieval times, here's a few pieces of advice:

Bring Cash: They only accept cash for their paid parking when you enter. And you MUST pay on the way in. It was 11$. Also, your \"serving wench\" will hand you a little tray with a thank you card for gratuities at the end... you must decide if you want to do this!

They DO NOT direct their parking traffic. There is plenty of parking, but if you're going to the 7.30 show (like we were), you are contending with the people coming in, and the people coming out of the parking lot. And lately, they have been renovating... to get to the parking, it was quite confusing, almost infuriating. People cut you off, honk at you, gesture at you... it's a mad house! I would suggest getting there early simply to avoid the \"outgoing\" traffic of the 4.30 show (or, on the weekend, go to the 1.30 show instead).

When you come in, there is parking either left or right. We went left, but had to cut across the people exiting to get to the parking area. (you might want to do an aerial view on google maps to get an idea what the parking looks like).

Get there early. Non royalty seats are first come first serve. Because we had to fight traffic, even though we arrived their 45 minutes early, finding a parking spot took lots of time. So we arrived about 20 minutes early inside the actual building. There is a separate line for those who have their online tickets, be sure to look for it on the way in.

Although two wet-naps are provided, it's not enough for the full meal. So I suggest bringing more yourself - or baby wipes, at the least.

Souvenirs? Get a beer. It comes in a pretty cool souvenir mug. The price tag is roughly 13$. Other drinks come in plastic souvenir cups and they are 7$.

At your table, the server offers water or pepsi, but only comes 2 times to fill it. Coffee is served after dessert... I wish it was at the same time.

The chicken \"skin\" is nice, but I wish there was a dipping sauce for it. It's a little dry. May I suggest bringing your own?

Fun to do... even if you don't bring your extras."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a long time. It wasn't as great as I thought but I still give it 4 stars because of the concept and hospitality. 

The customer service and servers were really friendly, it was something different,  the food was good ( a little bland but hey its the medieval times its expected) the food serving was generous as well!  We were served tomatoe soup with garlic bread, chicken , sweet corn and potato. For dessert we had butter tart.

The show I thought could have been a little better, more story like but it was still interested.  Must go atleast once."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a good time. The show is okay. The food is okay. The Service is good and the drink (alcohol) prices are a bit over the top. 
I think it's a fun night and everyone should do it at least once. I've been more than once by the way."}
{"text":"Its a great place and great show for all ages. You never feel bored here. Full of excitement and thrills throughout the show. Horses and falcons were trained very well. The food was well prepared and served professional and timely manner. 

I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"They lost a star because because my champion was bested. 
And the price.

Tip 1 bring pants and long sleeve shirt at least, a/c was full blast and everyone was freezing, they brought us a cape/blanket to keep us warm so it made up for it.

Tip 2 - bring change, or cash. We were invited but looked stupid not tipping our wench, regardless.. :(

Best toronto attraction .. food and a show!!! = win!"}
{"text":"Great times! THe food was good, the show was fun, one Knight was a babe and Thomas, our man wench, was an awesome server. (I vote Thomas for man wench of the year).

The staff stay in character and 99 percent of them seem to actually like their jobs which is refreshing. It is easy to get entrapped by the Disney-esque shops and even easier to get entrapped into buying a beer Stein for the adults. Of note...When you buy a drink-you get a take home cup so you may as well save your money unless you are emotionally invested in a medieval times Stein...which I was....

Not just for kids. Loved the garlic bread. 

Con: I found parking pricey."}
{"text":"Dinner and a show !!! The tomato soup (dragon blood) is the best part of the meal. I love the way you have to drink it with no spoon.  The baby dragon (half a chicken) is very delicious.  I just wished that they had the option of getting two breast instead.  The dessert give much to
Improve on.  It is similar to a baked apple
Pie from McDonald's but, worse.   The servers are great and they play along with the whole experience.  The show is amazing, can get a bit repetitive with the amount of fighting.  I would totally Recommend this place as a one time experience.  I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time!  Front row seats in the Blue section, we had a fantastic server who was very funny and definitely made the entire experience memorable.  If you have the chance to upgrade your seats to royalty to sit closer to the front, I highly recommend it, gets you much more \"into\" the show.  Food was not so great (I had the vegetarian meal) but the show and atmosphere made up for what the food lacked.  All-in-all a great night!!"}
{"text":"I really had an amazing time there! Kids would love it."}
{"text":"I really love going to Medieval Times - it's one of those some-what tacky events, but at the same time fun, lively place.

Experiences by \"The Times\":

1. I remember going there for my first show when I was a plucky pre-pubescent teen - glasses half the size of my face and sporting a 90's front-side pony tail. I cheered for my knight like it was no one's business and yes (!!!!), I got a precious flower. I caught the eye of my beloved prince *heart*

2. Then, I went there again during my university days... with another couple and it was fun again: cheering, drinking, ordering more beer, and more beer, from the man-wench.

3. And fast forward to my thirties, where I have to admit, I still had a great time. Medieval Times, you still got it! 

4. Futurama - This is definitely a great kids place - When I have kids ( and if my kids haven't turned emo on me) I will definitely bring them here.

My fiancé and I arrived late, but we soon got our crowns (we were the Red and Yellow team) and found our section. Soon enough, someone came to ask if we wanted anything from the bar. The order was placed on a very non-medieval machine-terminal, and our drinks were promptly delivered. Prices for a 9oz glass of wine is not too bad, considering I got to down it as I was watching my knight DEFEND HIS HONOR *echo* *echo*

Food is, well, you don't come to Medieval Times for gourmet eats. I may be the only one saying this, but I highly enjoyed the \"Campbell's Tomato canned soup poured from a coffee mug. That, with a buttery, garlicky piece of bread for dipping, and my night was made.

Main comes with a half-chicken (ok) and one rib (ok) and a small-ish, salty, baked potato (with no sides). Again, it's what you make of it - I enjoyed the meal (or what I ate of it), because it's still food and I bet they wasted nothing in dem times. For \"dessert,\" I really enjoyed the \"Costco-bought\" apple pastry - because you know, sometimes you just need fake sugar, fake apple, and dry, expired pastry.

I thought our waiter (or man-wench as you call them) was spot on. He gave us hot sauce for our chicken when asked (the hot sauce definitely improves the chicken!!) and gave us re-fills promptly. For all the brunt work these people have to do, I left him a nice tip. 

I really would like to know how the winning knight is decided - our area for sure thought our knight was going to win...we shouted at the TOP OF OUR LUNGS! But alas, he was killed off in a semi-bad performance of slow-motion sword swinging and man-grunting.

Anyone looking for cheesy entertainment, Medieval Times is your place!"}
{"text":"Booked this with some friends and my partner for a night out. We managed to get the tickets cheaper as we wernt too happy paying normal price. Have to say it was worth every penny. It was such a good atmosphere as soon as we got threw the door. The food was lovely and so much of it. The entertainment had us cheering all night.i would definatly go again. Just a shame it's so exapensive."}
{"text":"3rd visit to Medieval Times. Great experience as always. Horses and the falcon are absolutely wonderful, staff is super friendly and they all stay in character throughout the whole show. Food is nice, portions are huge (I am yet to ever finish the whole thing) Great place for the whole family, or a group of friends. Totally worth it to upgrade to royalty package and arrive early. :)"}
{"text":"It is a fun place, I really enjoy the show so I would rate it as 4 but the food was not good and I would rate it as 2. The chicken had no seasoning and was dry, the corn was overcooked and it was way too soft, the dessert was nothing special (a piece of lemon cake)."}
{"text":"What doth drive the noble Manager of Communities from Yelp lands north, east, and west of the Kingdom of Toronto into a veritable frenzy? 

Me thinks it 'tis a visit to Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament. A place where wenches serve up grogs of ale (or your choice of alcoholic/non-alcoholic options) along side of a feast of Dragon blood (Tomato bisque soup), baby dragon (chicken - an entire 1/2), Ribs, garlic bread, root vegetable (potato) and a sweet tart to sate your sinfully sweet tooth!

Whilst dining on this feast fit for Kings, you'll be entertained by the tournament and exhibitions before you. Birds of prey soaring above, hand to hand combat, mighty stallions performing feats of acrobatics never before seen, and if ye be a damsel a chance encounter with the knight of your choosing. 

While the eve is one of greatness and fond memory, the tax a mighty lord must levy on his subjects in order to gain entry to this mighty tournament is more than heavy. Even after the wizardry of Groupon, the eve is expensive (far more than a few sheckels) and the ale comes at a super premium.

What HO! Mighty Eatcrest takes his Leave Yo!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take kids or to go if you're feeling touristy.
It is rather expensive and additional items (such as shout out for birthdays/anniversaries) cost more on top of the admission fee. You can also purchase cups, toys, clothing and things that will most likely cause seizures from the servers walking around or in the novelty shop.

The meal is actually pretty filling as it consisted of 1/4 chicken, ribs, soup&bun, half a potato and dessert... all of which you eat with your hands (just like people from the medieval days)! While you are eating you are also watching knights on horses do things like battle or try to dagger a hoop... It was kind of like watching animal cruelty though as horses were being whipped to walk on their hind legs. 

The servers are very friendly and talked like medieval people.  

I've been to medieval times three times (once for every year I've lived in Ontario) and it's been the same thing every time so I would not suggest wasting money on going again but if it is your first time, then it is actually really fun and exciting."}
{"text":"One-time experience. Good for the kids. Food is underwhelming, basically just 1/2 roasted chicken that can easily be made at home with a huge roasted potato, a slice of butter corn and tomato soup that is poured from a kettle. Desert was ... Interesting. It was some sort of butter pie. Not sure. Had a bite and that was the end of it. It is basically cafeteria food. 

Show itself is not bad, can get repetitive due to very similar acts throughout the show. Amusing for the first 30 minutes then got a bit boring near the end. Horses are well trained. Actors were good. Generally you just come for the show, not the food. There were lots of times when you didn't feel like you were in the \"medieval times\". I think their decor/props/lighting could be better. Price point is high with the quality of food they are serving. Great for kids parties."}
{"text":"As many other reviewers have noted, this is really a one-and-done type of experience. Maybe once every decade or so, to be fair.

The Experience: They do a great job with the experience. There are a wide variety of items to buy, from wooden swords and shields (hey mom, at least it's not a gun!) to princess hats and some surprisingly affordable t-shirts--especially compared to other places in Toronto! For the high end Lords, there are real weapons for purchase, including replicas of some doozies from \"Game of Thrones.\"

The staff are more friendly than most, which definitely helps you spend money. You get plenty of time to walk around the quite expansive center square area to peruse the stands, though some more seating would have been appreciated.

The color paper crown they give you determines which section you are seated in. Spoiler alert: The section with the loudest crowd will have the winning knight.

Food is average, but let's be honest, that's not why we're here. The action is the attraction, and they do a good job, complete with English accents (which I've always found funny; we have no idea if they talked that way hundreds of years ago, why do we just accept it as gospel?). The knights are all capable horsemen and you even get some sparks when swords clang together.

Back to the food, the tomato bisque soup is surprisingly good. The garlic bread is store bought, as is the rotating dessert (we had lemon pound cake, which we enjoyed). The chicken is large but the skin can be tough--hey, you try cooking for 300 people at once--outside of that it's a hearty piece of meat that shouldn't leave you hungry.

I scored a Black Friday deal on tickets, I've heard that coupon codes are plentiful so look around before making a reservation."}
{"text":"- if you have never been to medieval times, you need to go now. it's spectacular. GO.
- for any reviewers who down this place, get off your high horse (pun intended).... it's a night of fun, where you can watch people play make believe with very well trained horses, big mullets, and utensil-less food.
- the beer/booze is a little pricey
- make sure you go with fun people who aren't stuck-up, pretentious, and can just let loose and cheer for some pretend-knights."}
{"text":"Took the kids ages 9, 5 and 14 there.  It was their first time.  Parking was $12.  We got there early as it was a first come first seating.   Doors open 75 minutes before the show.  There was quite a lineup rhat build up fast.  We were ushered in quickly and immediately prompted to take a group photo with the king.  Picture later shown for purchased at $20.  As you walked into the massive room, it felt like a big gift shop with numerous counters and stands of souvenirs to buy.  From swords to toys to hats and crowns.  The bar was right front and centre.  It felt like an aggressive setup to boost sales.  You can go into The torture chamber for a fee, make a celebration announcement for a fee... Etc. Lots of upselling.  The food was good except chicken was bland.  My kids and I were forced to be very heavy handed with the salt.  The garlic bread could be better.  The coffee should have been served with the dessert not 10 minutes later.  Overall the kids had fun.  The staff was friendly and very courteous.   It was my 3rd time going so it was not as exciting.   They need to switch up their shows to get regular patrons.  Perhaps do a christmas theme or valentines..  Different story lines.  Otherwise it really is jyst a one-of type of visit."}
{"text":"Caught the 7:30pm show on a Tuesday 

Pros:
- Great food
- Good service 
- Good show

Cons:
- Pricey 
- Need to train their horses better, there was one point where we waited a good 10 minutes for the horse to settle down."}
{"text":"Messy queue system to enter, best to arrive really early. Show times are about an hour after you enter, there's a few attractions inside which aren't too bad. We went to the Museum of Torture, which is $2 per person, and it's a so-so experience. You get to read some history on torture instruments used during Medieval Times and look at them. The show itself was amazing! Food wasn't bad, very bland and needed a lot of extra seasoning. Overall a great and fun experience, tad pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"So 1st thing is first.... you get a nice big dinner, you eat it all with your hands tho! 

The soup was probably my favourite of the dinner course. The desert pastry was also pretty great. 

I like how hey give you enough time to eat without really missing much of the show. 

The food and beverages are all included in the price but alcoholic drinks are separate. 

The show itself was great! The people in the arena are quiet interactive with the audience, from throwing them a flower to giving them ribbons, makes it pretty interesting experience. 

All in all, I'd give this a five star rating. It is better when the show is more full with audience tho!

If it's your birthday, come in with ID to prove it, and you'll get a free entry."}
{"text":"Over-hyped. 

We arrived 10 min. late and there was no way to enter. The doors didn't even have handles! Late arrivals will be locked out beware. 

We found a service garage door and a custodian reluctantly let us in. 

The show was... eh. Not worth the drive & trouble. IMO good for kids 2-10. 

The food was basic. The soup was reminiscent of alphabet soup minus the alphabets. However my husband was thrilled. I mean, he got to eat with his bare hands! I just wanted a fork for my super greasy bland chicken. 

We didn't get our paper crowns (because we were late?) so I ventured over to the gift shops. I was shocked at how expensive everything was. Nope nope nope."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time at Medieval Times recently. Admittedly, my expectations weren't that high but they were met, and then some. 

We had front-row seats which probably helped a bit to make us feel like we're part of the action, but in my opinion most of the seats in the arena would be decent seats since there really aren't that many rows (I think there's 4, maybe 5 rows of seats). The only exception may be the seats right in the corners, at the back. 

I was quite surprised to see the \"knights\" duke it out with what appeared to be real (or at least, real metal) swords. Plus, the knight's lances actually splintered during jousting as it connected with the shields of their opponents. Nice!

The story-line is a little \"cheesy\" as others have noted, but it somehow fits with the overall experience.

We got our tickets at a discount (they frequently have specials so look out for half-price deals, etc.) and all in all, it was money well spent."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and I was pretty pumped. We had reservations and pre-paid, so getting in was a breeze. There's a bar, many gift shops and some entertainment before heading into the arena. 

After making our way to the table, our server introduced herself, got us cheering and drinks were served. The food was pretty quick; our napkin had the menu printed on it. 

There are no utensils, but there is a wet nap on the table when you arrive. USE IT. After the meal you get another, bigger wet nap since you're eating with your hands. The food is pretty good. The Tomato Bisque was great! The chicken was moist and the corn was buttery. The seasoned potato didn't taste seasoned, meh. Dessert was a buttertart and I enjoyed it...ok I enjoyed 2....might've stolen my friend's...maybe.

So, when they tell you the gratuity is not included, tipping the bar server DOES NOT COUNT. Tips are not shared. Make sure you tip your food server directly! The service is great!

The show wasn't what I expected. I thought it was more of a tournament, but half of it was a horse show. They were beautiful and fully trained. The jousting was fun, but I had no idea after a knight fell off the horse that the 2 knights would fight. Battle to the death! That was kinda neat. Good entertainment for families."}
{"text":"I've lived in Toronto all my life, but I've never gotten to go to Medieval Times until tonight!

I thought it was truly fun, and a great first-second-or-third date option.  Good way to be able to chat with someone, but always have something to distract you (although you do eat with your hands, so make sure the person you're taking is okay getting messy).  We didn't have tickets or reservations, and just wandered in ten minutes before the show started.  Tons of tickets left.  $100 for two people

Drinks are extra (alcoholic ones), but do include cute souvenir glasses.  Food was fun, all things considered - it's not GOOD food, it's just part of the overall experience.  

Almost 75% of the audience was 16 years old or older."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, and it's seriously one of the most fun nights you can have in Toronto. I know what you're thinking, \"seriously?\" Seriously!

It's as fun as you make it though - just be sure to yell at the top of your lungs for your knight all night, and your server when they go a-marching on the field, and generally anything cloaked in your knight's color. And be sure to check in with Sir Richard, because he's awesome. And heck, splurge on the stupid hats... it's all part of the experience.

Listen though - it's not the best meal you'll get in Toronto, nor is it the most exciting show you could see. But if you love horses, love yelling for the sake of yelling, and want to take your chances with having your knight bestow upon you a flower - it's not a waste of an evening. 

It is expensive though - so sign up for the birthday club and go then, so you don't feel bad splurging )once again) on the front row seats, cause that's where the party's at."}
{"text":"I have been here once before but I was too young to remember so I recently had the chance to go again and had a great time! This is a really unique place for entertainment in Toronto and I enjoyed watching the show while also having dinner there. The food was better than I expected and would definitely come again in the future!"}
{"text":"Whipping horses at the start of the show was not nice. Way too much animal abuse at the beginning of the show. After that - everything else was good. Not sure why they also took forever to serve the potatoes and corn that go with the chicken - but the only reason they get 1 star is because the animal cruelty at the start of the show. If I wanted to see someone getting whipped - I would have gone out to see 50 shades of grey."}
{"text":"WHOOHOO! So much fun! I took my daughter on a visit to Toronto.  I have to admit I have always wanted to go. We were able to be loud and crazy while eating and enjoying the horses and cool games and fights. Best tip I can say if you plan on going is to sign up for their deal alert email. Almost every month there is a half priced promotion, which I got and was a big value!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this show since I have heard many good things about it. The atmosphere was nice, it made you feel like you have walked back into medieval times, the gift shop (like any) was expensive. The show itself was good but that amazing. I feel this show is great for families with young children, but for adults it was OK. The major downfall was its food I know we were suppose to eat like we from the medieval times, however there was no taste in their food. Other then that i had a OK times. If you wish to go still, just bring your own fork and spoon, they do not provide it"}
{"text":"I LOVE Medieval Times. I came here last week with about 20 people and we had a great time. 

It was cheesy and fun, and pretty cheap seeing as we got a coupon code from Red Flag Deals.

They lose some points because the ticket buying process was kind of difficult and complicated (20 people, buying separately, paying separately. bleah) and the food was really salty, but the service was super friendly and we had a wicked time!"}
{"text":"I have always thought Medieval Times to be a polarizing venue. Simply due to the fact a certain number of people may be \"taken\" here rather than be willfully \"going\" and hence your mileage may vary. 

As a child and teenager, I enjoyed coming here. It was a fun night out as the spectacle of it all was rather fetching to my imagination. The food was alright and I enjoyed the touch of it being served a la mode for the 12th century, that is, with no cutlery.  

However, after a few times, it got stale faster than when the Mongols invaded Europe in the 13th century. As such, I decided to avoid going as it got very repetitive, unlike the Mongols, who would murder you if you said that to their face. 

I digress, in the end, the framing of the show was the same, the lighting was the same, the response of the narrator/voice-over was the same, so was most of the acting by either the waitstaff or the knights. Everything except the actual winner was the same most of the time. I once was there when the same actor, playing the same colored knight won. Twice.

So, is it good? Yes! If you go there less than say, 3-5 times in your entire life AND/OR if you have children OR if you have out-of-towners visiting. However, at that point, you are attending for them, not for yourself. 

As an adult, again, if you go seldomly... very seldomly, then sure, why not? However, the charm will wear off quick. 

It is worth noting that as a child, I found the food to be fun, however, as an adult, I find the food to be just \"Meh\" or \"Okay\" at best. Again, not terrible but also not worth repeating more than a few times. Ever. 

Not to mention the pretty dead \"after party\" they used to host every night after the show. Sticking around --which I did more than once due to out-of-towners -- can get pretty overpriced,  lame and boring. Perfect for those of you who are into Candy Crush, Plants VS Zombies 2, or whichever game your might be into to pass the time or just simply check your e-mail. Just make sure you have a full charge.  

Unless you are REALLY into watching pseudo-real life RPG-lite acting being played out in front of you, do check it out. Once. Maybe twice, and then head back straight to the 21st century."}
{"text":"Holy crap, you were suprisingly entertaining?!

This is one of those things that I didnt' even know was on my to-do list until after I saw it!

How can you resist kings and queens, knights skillful swordplay, valourous jousting and gallant horses?
*I* certainly can't.

Came here on a two for one special, meaning one ticket for a show, meal and a damn good time was only 35$

I don't want to describe the show too much because I too want you to be in for a mezmorizing surprise, so I'll leave it here.

(It's really good.  really)

But I'll give you some tips- 

1) try and ask to be seated at the white and black table OR the red tables because it is an oval stadium seating and those areas will give you the best views.  I was totally lucky that the seating arrangement worked out for us

2) It says to arrive an HOUR before the show starts.  Don't.  or else you will be waiting and it will be annoying.  I arrived just 10 minutes before the show, got the best seats in the house, AND I didn't have to be annoyingly early.  

3)But if you DO come early there are a LOT of picture opportunities that you will not want to miss! 

4) the ticket dude that you need to go to to get your seating cards (yes, even if you have an e-ticket already)- will offer you a ticket to the dungeon for 2$ extra.  It's worth it (for more pic opportunities).  Do it.  it's a toonie and, really, what else are you gonna do with it?

5) They have a vegetarian option and I'm sure they could muster some sort of vegan option if you ask.  AND the vegge option comes with plastic cutlery (which the meat option doesn't b/c they are trying to stay true to, yes, medieval times).  Both options are surprisingly good.  I was expecting sooo little out of my meal that it was actually nice to get something substantial and rather good.  Don't expect amazing, but everything is like.. a well-seasoned-what- you- COULD- cook- at- home- but you didn't. 
AND the portions are massive.

6) There is a \"special requests\" box when you buy your tix online.  They do fun announcements during the show so if you have a special occasion or want to make one up, I highly reccomend it.  Write it in 'ye olde english' for the best effect.

7) Don't rush out of the place in the end of the show!  the characters come out to take pictures with you!  They are lovely and couteous and a couple of the knights are, dare I say, quite handsome.

8) I hear parking is a rip, like $9-12.  So I suggest you TTC to Exhibition, or if you don't want to walk there along train lines and across parking lots, take the King streeet car all the way down to dufferin and walk down.

9) you get to enjoy the show free on your birthday so take someone for that!  And only go when they have the 50% special.  I think if I had paid 70$ I would have been disappointed for what I got.  But because it was only $35 I REALLY felt like I got value.

10) Please tip your server.  he/she does a fairly excellent job staying in character and being accommodating (even though my server did break character when he had to offer us coffeemate- but it only made it funnier).  If you see what they have to do its kind of one of the worst jobs in the world and they aren't getting that big of a cut from ticket prices to be there.

I really hope you will go!  It's incredible!"}
{"text":"I don't like creating too much hype over any place and even though no place is perfect and everyone's experience is subjective, my experience here deserves five stars.
First off, just a helpful suggestion. Always look for promotion codes on Medieval Times website (on their homepage) for some descent deals that can save some money. 

My partner and I took my mother and brother who are visiting Toronto to Medieval Times as they have never been and thought it might be nice. 

We arrived an hour early (they suggest to arrive 75 minutes before the beginning of the show), which is nice to get settled in and see the animals and have a drink while the actors pump the crowd up for the show. 

Once you are lead into the beautiful arena and seating area and the show begins, expect about 2 hours until the end. 

The entertainment follows a storyline that I believe can differ from show to show but is the same basic entertainment. 

The falcon and horses are fantastic and trained very well. 

The jousting and fighting can be a tad overly theatrical but they have to do it in such a manner so they do not get hurt and it's still very fun to watch. 

The food is a predetermined menu that is actually very well prepared and is fun to eat with your hands. They do have special menu requests for those who may have dietary restrictions, so don't worry if you are a vegetarian.

After your meal you do get your choice of coffee or tea and a dessert as well. 

The meal is actually fantastic and very plentiful.

This is a show that I personally give a high recommendation for but I also add that one must bring a good attitude when attending. The show is made better when people get more involved in the show and the cheering. It really makes the whole experience more fun. 

Is this something I would go to once a month? Not at all. But when people come to visit me and they want to experience something different I will definitely make the suggestion and I will have no problem tagging along."}
{"text":"I am a great fan of Medieval Times. How can it get any better than having dinner and a show.

How it works? - When you come in, you get sorted into different colour teams. You sit in a section with the people on your same team and you get to cheer on the knight that matches your colour. The knights participate in a tournament as you get to eat and drink. The food is ok and since you get to eat with your hands only, it's quite a novelty.

I have already been twice to two different shows. They update the shows periodically and I would definitely go back to Medieval Times."}
{"text":"I really can't explain it: this place sucks, but you should still go.

It's basically like WWF wrestling, but Ye Olde. Plus horses.

The whole shebang is timed and planned to a tee, it's a giant machine that gathers and churns out the 400 people in a prescribed amount of time. Everything that happens is scripted: what food you get, when the server comes back to give you a refill, when the manager asks you if everything is okay. The server has a giant baking sheet with exactly the correct number of portions for the section, no extras, and it's lukewarm and covered with greasy tinfoil. NO FOOD WASTAGE, MUST PROTECT GROSS MARGIN.

Don't even think about \"flagging your server down,\" they will come by when the script says it is time to come by again.

Every single corner it's possible to cut, they've cut it. Your menu is printed on the tiniest napkin ever - which is awesome considering you are eating with your hands. The \"dessert\" is literally a stale passion flakie, it's awful. But it gets better: if you watch closely, you will see that your servers actually have to run down and put on costumes and PERFORM in a crowd scene. Because who needs extras when you have servers? Multitask or get out of the way!!

They are sucking money out of you at every turn, for souvenirs and photographs and the most ridiculous things. Every amusement park, tourist-trappy thing you can imagine, they're doing it. 11$ for parking, y'all, on a non-event night in the dead of winter.

But the staff are super kind and working unbelievably hard. I could not do any of their jobs, they are doing something VERY strenuous and knowing it's pretty mediocre, and smiling about it. The \"knights\" come out after the show and pose for photos with portly bachelorettes making very original lance jokes, and then manage to turn around and get down on one knee and goof off with a bunch of toddlers, it's very sweet.

But yes, you should go. It's hilarious. Pre-pay for a bottle of wine (20$) and just get smashed. You will NOT be in the minority. It is so camp it's absurd, and if you can just get over worrying about the animals being unhappy, and just give in, you'll probably enjoy it. You can just shout the most unbelievable things, and you are close enough that you can see they hear you, and it's super satisfying to get them to break character a bit. The first half of the show is pretty stupid, but then they start fighting in the dirt and it gets more marvellous. And these knights, they're easy on the eyes, believe you me.

So, it sucks, and go KNOWING that it sucks and just marvel at the precision with which they run this massive operation. And in the summer, they do it three times daily! And just get into the spirit of things, you'll enjoy it in spite of almost absolutely everything."}
{"text":"I booked the Celebration Package for us which included priority castle access, VIP seating, VIP lanyard, personalized birthday announcement, cake, cheering banner, team towel, and group photo for each member of the party.  It was such a great package to celebrate a birthday with!

I had a good time at this event.  The food was served according to the style they might have served food in the medieval times (circa 11th century) which means there were no utensils and everyone eats with their hands.  It was a four-course banquet which consisted of tomato bisque soup, garlic bread, roasted half chicken, herb-basted potato, buttered corn, and pastry of the castle with two rounds of select beverages and coffee or tea.  It is such a clever way of pretending like you are dining in that era while cheering on your knight.

I highly recommend the Celebration Package if you intend to bring a loved one here to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday (yes I love doing stuff like this to celebrate as opposed to a fancy little dinner somewhere) and we all loved it! 

(I admit, I started writing this review giving it 4 stars, but while thinking about it I changed it to 5 stars, but here's what I wrote when it was still a 4 star review): 
It's missing out on the 5th star due to the food which I thought should have been a little bit better. I was not expecting a high quality meal, but maybe a slightly different menu item here and there could make it a great meal. The soup could have been better, it just seemed to have a very generic mass produced type taste (if there is such a thing), the garlic bread was comparable in taste to what you can find at Pizza Hut but fresh, the chicken was a better(tastier) version of a Costco Rotisserie Chicken, the rib was comparable to a St Louis Bar type quality, baked potato was the most boring item on the plate and the pastry dessert was good for what it was, I guess a different sort of dessert might seem out of place? 
I realise the above descriptions are not very flattering, but the meal was good, very large in size and enjoyable and not once while eating it did I wish it to be better. I would say I was expecting it to be of that level and if I were to have been pleasently surprised this would be a 5 star rating. 

Everything else apart from the food was 5 star! True, alcoholic beverages were pricey, but considering some bars charge you $10 for a shot, the fancy cocktail I got (the most expensive on the menu) in a collectible goblet for $16 seems to be OK considering the drink had a heaping amount of alcohol in it :) And the beer was around $8 in a less than fancy holographic cup. 

I had 10 people in my group and it cost each of us $36 (tax and tip included) and for what we got back, it was completely worth every penny! 

Our \"wench\" or server as we call them now, did a great job keeping in character and went the extra mile for me once she found it was my birthday and made me stand up and cheer when our Knight was competing. 
The show has a storyline of sorts to it, but you really are not going to see medieval times for the quality story telling. The audience is divided into supporting a different coloured knight and is asked to cheer for their knight or boo their own antagonist. 

Without trying to spoil the show for you, here's a brief description: There are acts displaying horsemanship before the knights come out for rounds of competition before the final competition which includes jousting and \"hand to hand\" combat. All the successful knights are then given a flower by the princess and they in turn turn to their audience and we try to get him to throw the flower towards us :)  

There is great audience participation, and while cheesy it is completely fun! We went to a Sunday afternoon show and while there were families, I would say there was a 50/50 split between groups consisting of only adults and families (maybe even 60/40 for adults/kids)

After the show, the royal family and knights come out for chatting and picture taking!  You can get \"knighted\" before the show if you wish, but I didn't really opt for that. We were sitting on the 4th and last row of tables, but that didn't diminish our experience one bit, although people sitting towards the middle of the field would have have a closer view on the fighting which took place in the center. 

I would love to go again, but I would hope that it would be for a slightly different show. They do change up the shows I hear but not certain how often."}
{"text":"2nd time my family went here and we tried to celebrate NYE. Show is 100% awesome as the first time we watched it. Also, shoutout to our wench Claire (blue seats) for doing a great job serving us so fast and always with smile. 
Here are the downside:
1. Entrance to the castle is so disorganized. Both visits were like that. Very disappointing as we were early on both visits but saw lots of late, insensitive people able to get in front of line. 
2. Aweful falconer. All the guests were requested to go to the lobby for the NYE celebration. While waiting for midnight, characters like knights, falconer are roaming around to mingle. My family tried to get a picture with the falconer. My husband tried to go to the left side (falcon is at the guy's left hand) and falconer got upset and told my husband that \"it's COMMONSENSE he should never ever get too close to the falcon\". It's his way of telling people that upsets us. If the falcon could be danger to us, with that high volume of people and loud sound for the new year celebration, he should just keep the falcon in its cage and not telling people ( who trusted him he had control or tamed the falcon) to have commonsense. 

Before the show, I am thinking to bring my future visitors here. But after the countdown and total experience, big NO."}
{"text":"Great place to go with the family! Tons of food and entertainment! It's a must see :)"}
{"text":"It was MUCH better than I remembered it to be. I think this was the 2nd time I've been as an adult - but I kind of enjoyed it. It's still kind of cheesy, not something would immediately want to go again in the near future, but I can totally see the appeal for first timers and kids. 

And if you love horses, there are so many of them. Don't forget to stop by the area in the front where you can peek into their stables!

The regular price for an adult is $65. I don't think it's worth $65. You get a 4 course meal which in itself I would rate 2 stars, but it's filling and decent. It includes a tomato soup with garlic bread, half a chicken a la swiss chalet calibre, ONE rib, ONE potato baked, and something that resembles a frozen mccains apple pie. 

Then there is the 1.5 hour show. It's entertainment, but it's pretty cool. Beautiful horses, and you have to appreciate the skill involved riding and training them, and fighting on them!

Try to find a corporate discount, or wait for a sale. We were able to get tickets for $45 with my corporate discount. They also have some deal where you can add $16 and get a program, birthday announcement, and a flag. I wonder if you can do that for only one person in your party. 

Parking is $11 on site, but if you leave the Ex grounds and go across the bridge in to the city, you can fnid some free street parking. 

A note for anyone with asthma or allergies like me - I'm allergic to horses, and I started feeling it halfway into the show. The reactine helped, but then my asthma started acting up and I found it hard to breathe. Be prepared!

Fully recommended if you've never been - or haven't been in more than 10 years."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is decent & the show is amazing! The horses were so beautiful, along with their choreography. Just a few tips. Taking the GO train might be your best bet since you have to pay for parking at the Exhibition. The go train is a ten minute walk away! Also, bring change for a tip for your wench and arrive at least 30 minutes early because the line can be kind of long on a busy night. 

This place is great for kids! Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Always a campy fun way to spend a birthday :') decent food, silly show, economic price. Worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bargain for the price (basic entrance).  With a simple dinner and show for around $40-50/per person, what more can you ask for? Our server Daisy was friendly and attentive, which made the night even better. Keep in mind parking is now $12, that is right next to the building. Highly recommend the show."}
{"text":"Mt fiance and I purchased a Groupon for Medieval Times because the last time I went was in grade 4. We figured it would be a fun date night.

We arrived just before the 7:30pm start time on a Saturday night and were offered the option of upgrading our tickets to better seats for $10-$20. We opted to stay with our Groupon seats. 

We were situated at the very back of the stadium. There are maybe 5-6 rows in total, so it wasn't that bad. We still had a good view of everything. 

Food was mediocre, but I don't expect good food at places like these. Everyone had the same thing; tomato soup, garlic bread, half a chicken, roast potato, corn, butter tart. Soup tasted like Campbell's, chicken was very dry, we were given one piece of roast potato, and the corn was super buttery and therefore, good. Butter tart tasted like the run of the mill store bought tarts. We were offered pop and water throughout the evening and coffee or tea to go with our desserts. 

On to the show. When I was 8, I remember Medieval Times being the coolest experience ever. I found the show kind of cheesy this time around. The Masters of Ceremony was great though and stayed in character all night. He cracked a few jokes that went over the little ones' heads. The horses are well trained and it was cool seeing the horses dance around on their hind legs. I didn't remember there being a falcon segment, so that was a nice surprise. The fight scenes with the knights are over exaggerated and campy, but it's fun cheering on your knight. 

All in all, this isn't a bad idea for a date night in Toronto, especially if you can snag yourself a Groupon or other deal. 

The blended drinks are very good."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Our knight was the red knight. Great horsemanship! The premise is this... knights representing the lands under the Kings rule have arrived for a display of prowess and chivalry, a tournament! They all, both on and off of horseback, put on a magnificent show!

The food served was a tomato soup, garlic bread, half a baby dragon (roasted chicken) with a half of baked potato, half a cob of corn and a royal pastry to end. No cutlery and only one napkin. Quite medieval to say the least! ;)

The food tastes fine and is enough to fill your stomach, but you come for the show, not the dining! With discounted tickets, it's fully worth every penny! 

I will warn you, bring an extra $20-$60 for souvenirs and trinkets!"}
{"text":"Just came back from the 'Times and I have to admit that I had a really, really good time !!

I wanted to take my cousin (visiting from overseas) here, but hesitated after finding out that one ticket would cost me $88. Luckily, as I had Medieval Times on the brain, there was a Groupon for $44 that popped up in my Inbox. I'm not sure if I'd come back if I had to pay full price though.... The food was an experience in itself. We started with tomato soup, followed by garlic bread, chicken, a rib, and a potato. With no cutlery, I enjoyed eating the meal with my hands as I cheered on. Our server was excellent; he got into character and referred to our row as his Lords or Ladies.**  The 'fights' are as authentic as WWF, but it's so fun to watch - everyone around us were really into it and there was a lot of energy from the audience. Don't worry, it's not random fighting - there's a story behind it. 

Good for: out-of-towners, groups

** Don't forget cash to tip the server; I seldom have cash on me so I had to borrow $10 from my cousin."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to Medieval Times since I was in my 20s, I'm currently close to my mid 30s and the wait was SOO WORTH IT!! I had an amazing time and I can't wait to go back!! The show, the wenches and the food was great!!"}
{"text":"I loved the show. It was great, but I wish the costumes were a bit better. It is also not a place where you can expect amazing food. Obviously, people don't go there for the food. Other than that, the show was super entertaining."}
{"text":"I really like Medieval Times, I am really into that time period of the Mid Ages not in a Freak sort of way but more of a Historian way. 

The place is quite big and they do go all out to make you feel like if you were in that era, the actors do a good job of re-enacting those times. The show over all is good and actually kind of fun, I enjoy yelling random stuff while having dinner as if I was crazy - I did not know this about myself. 

The food is actually good, the soap at the beginning of the meal was nice, the chicken is well seasoned, the dessert could be a little better like a piece of pie or cake not the sweet roll that they serve and I am glad there is coffee served! I had a lot of fun going and have been back 2 other times.

{"text":"We took bae's fam jam here in honor of his Dad's birthday for a different experience.

We had a lot of fun together and really enjoyed our time at the castle.

The food was surprisingly delicious consisting of garlic bread, tomato soup, literally half of a chicken, buttered corn, roasted potato, Pepsi products, butter tart, and tea or coffee. Yes you do have to eat with your hands - it's all part of the experience!

Sadly our knight (the Green night) didn't make it but we had fun cheering him on throughout the night.

We enjoyed the show overall and I would recommend this to anyone to go and check out."}
{"text":"I went to Medieval Times last night as part of a work event - last time I went was during elementary school. 

Service was excellent, they stick with the medieval theme pretty religiously and it's an interesting experience overall. The food is decent quality and very filling - tomato soup, garlic bread, and the chicken was good (plus an awesome surprise that halal was available), potato was hard, pastry was ok, virgin pina colada had a bad aftertaste.  

BUT this is definitely geared towards kids. The conversation with my co-workers kept me entertained, otherwise I was bored and felt the program was too long.  I wouldn't recommend this to adults only, but would highly recommend if you have elementary school aged children to take with you - they'll probably have a blast (saw some kids even standing up to cheer when the knights were jousting).

Note: there's no cutlery. The food isn't particularly messy and you get a couple wet napkins so I didn't have an issue with it. 2 co-workers found this out in advance so they smuggled in plastic forks/knives #thestruggleisreal"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: judging by the rest of the comments, most people will probably not agree with this.

To start with the good, the show is actually pretty impressive. The horses are well trained and it is fun to watch the duels between the knights.The knights themselves engage the public at all times, which offers a very vivid atmosphere. The falcon is by far the most impressive part of the show, it flew very close above the public's heads and seemed to be very well trained. 

However, I felt at all times that I was not really in a medieval environment, as much as the actors try to bring it to life. The cheap LED flowers/swords/shields were out of place. Same goes for the choice of Pepsi for drinks, which, you know, felt \"really\" medieval. The food was very \"meh\": plain tomato soup poured from a plastic kettle, a chicken without any sort of taste, a baked half a potato, 1/4 of a corn and cake that made me feel like I was eating a sponge.

In all honesty, I could have not cared for the food, if it were not for the cheaply manner in which it was served. In order to save money, the fork and knife were inexistent (unlike in medieval times, where even peasants ate with at least one knife). The menu was printed straight on the napkin. What shocked most is that, at times, I could see our server being on stage at the times when he did not have to serve us. Poor guy had to serve everyone as fast as possible, make sure he smiles and acts nicely so he gets tips at the end, then run backstage, put on a costume and appear on the stage. Unprofessional.

Overall, it felt sort of \"half-ass\". On the one hand, you had the king, the princess and the knights fighting on horseback, and on the other hand you had LED's, light shows and music in speakers. If you have children, 100% guaranteed they will love the place. If you are looking for a spot to go and actually enjoy a medieval environment, with singers playing the flute or the vielle, with chandeliers and medieval traditions, this won't cut it. This is more of a hybrid between medieval stereotypes and typical North American entertainment."}
{"text":"This is one of those novel places you go once in a while, or in my case, once every 15ish years. Absence, indeed, makes the heart grow fonder. Since I last came here over a decade ago, I have been itching to come back. I didn't really remember my experience as a kid, other than a really mean old woman snatching the rose away from my small hands. Still bitter.

They have quite a lot to do before the actual show. My friend and I went to the gift shop at the front (they have two). Then, we visited the dungeon where you can learn about and all sorts of medieval torture devices for a $2 entry fee. We went over to see the horses and I'm really glad there were windows to see them through because one of the horses decided to make a very massive shit so I left to get some drinks. They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol, which is exactly how I like my drinks. They were about $9 for the slushie drinks and another $9 for the souvenir cup.

The show was fun to watch and the atmosphere that night was great- it's always more fun when everyone is super into it and cheering for their respective knight. As for the food, it was definitely a feast. I really recommend the vegetarian option. Instead of chicken, you get a stew- super filling and delicious, and you also get veggies and hummus but otherwise, everything else was the same. I was slowly working away at my food that I didn't really watch the show too attentively. I don't even know who won lol. I had a great night overall and our server, Stephen, was so friendly! Definitely come here at least once."}
{"text":"You have to go to something like Medieval Times with an open-mind and a sense of fun. Also you HAVE to go with a group. This isn't even something to do with a couple...although I did see it happening. 

I went with my loud, boisterous family/friends. There were 8 of us in total. 

The last time I went to Medieval Time was in grade 4, so what better time to go, than for your 30th birthday. We bought drinks in advance. Drink prices were average for a bar, although the mixed drinks were particularly delicious. The cups are kind of fun and you can keep them. The whole place reminded me of something you would find in Vegas, with the whole entrance room decorated with medieval flags and armour. 

We were finally called in for dinner. Now, I want to preface this by saying that dinner is nothing special. You kind of go for the whole, goofy experience, not really the fine cuisine. You get tomato bisque, garlic bread, half of a chicken, a few potato wedges and a small thing of ribs and then an apple pastry for dessert. Everything is served separately, not all together, so you're eating everything one at a time. They are served to you by your \"wenches\". That said, while nothing was particularly impressive, nothing was bad either. You don't get cutlery, so you pick at everything with your fingers. However, they give you wetnaps and a hot towel at the end. My sister ordered the vegetarian meal and they gave her a veggie shish-kabob, which she said was quite good. 

Drinks are water or pepsi, or the drinks you order at the bar.

Now, onto the show. We cheered and yelled like crazy people the entire time. We picked fights with other \"teams\" (people cheering for other knights) and they picked fights back. We laughed and cheered and jeered at the knights. The show consists of some horse tricks, a falcon flying over you and of course the knights battling. Everything is exceedingly cheesy and you just have to enjoy it for what it is. 

Anyway, this was a cheesy, good time. I would do this again in an instant...but only with the right crowd.

PS - Our knight won! We think it was because we cheered loudest."}
{"text":"So we got free passes for this place and still feel ripped off. 

O.K maybe not that bad, but was expecting a way better show. The food was O.K but that's not what you're going for. You're going for the show with horses and knights combating. I found the show boring and not realistic. I just couldn't get into it.

I know tons of people who love Medieval Times. So I would still recommend seeing the show."}
{"text":"We held my son's 7th birthday here - with 3 of his friends. For boys are into battles, knights and wars, it was perfect and held their attention for the entire 2 hours. 

The food was as expected - it's hard to make a delicious meal in mass quantities, but it's a little better than average. The tomato bisque was the tastiest item on the menu. Great show and very good wait staff....make you sure you tip the servers well, they've got a hard job of serving you in the dark. 

It was certainly entertaining and for my party of 5 boys aged 7 (+my 3 1/2 year old son) it was great.  Make sure you get a Groupon or Living Social voucher, which are common. It's very easy to spend money on extras there. (Souvenirs, commemorative photos, etc) It's a fun evening out."}
{"text":"Went to MT with two teenaged boys on Saturday night.  Everyone had a blast.  Our knight won.  The food was good for the price (dinner and a live show for under $50 is fine by me).  No changes in the program from last time we were there (15-20 years ago), but will probably return sometime within the next 20."}
{"text":"Medieval times... A staple for toronto tourism... You can't meet anyone from the Gta who doesn't know about Medieval Times.. 

This was my second time visiting the Toronto Castle in the last few years, as it was a special occasion for my mother's birthday. 
My first time I came with a private party so it was definitely a different experience.

I purchased our tickets online with a generous discount code which in turn also works on upgrading your tickets.
With our upgrade we got FRONT ROW TICKETS, a free knight flag ($15 if you are not in VIP), a group photo with the princess, free cake and an announcement wishing my mother a happy birthday. 
She was ecstatic.

The whole idea of medieval times is that you are going back in time!! 
The sword fights, the jousting, the beautiful horses, it's terrific!
The actors really get into it!

Yes you eat with your hands, no cutlery allowed! You get assigned a knight when seated whom you root for during the performance. 

The food is delicious.. It's always the same meal (unless your a vegetarian) 
Tomato bisque soup, whole chicken leg, potatoes, corn, garlic toast, and dessert!! Omnoms!

You can also in turn purchase alcoholic drinks.

My only complaint is the fact that since you are already paying a premium for dinner and a show, they have their hand out for everything... Extra drinks, huge gift shop, extra costs for perks like knighting/announcements or if you want to visit the weaponry (real artifacts); Costs for photos... The list goes on!

Don't forget the parking!! The main lot next to medieval times is $11 for the day, but the 3 lot's close to the venue is $17 for the day.... 
Some people prefer to take transit and I don't blame them.

Medieval times is great don't get me wrong but if you were to pay full price for your ticket $65 + tax and processing fees, plus parking plus extras= costly day

As long as your prepared, you'll do great! According the women in my family, the knights are quite adorable to look at ;)

{"text":"by word of raven, it was declared that thy king has granted us an audience on a weeknight tournament. we set forth to pre-drink grog and tell tall tales in the annex before we embark to the castle

we reach the castle at sundown, my party is directed to yonder ticketh booth where we picked up our passes. the lady of marketing made it very easy for us \"contest champions\" to pick up and go right in. we were treated like the royalty we were the second we walked through the gates !

all this and more !

the action didn't stop and the \"acting\" was spot on. never once was character broken, my character insulted, nor did i feel unroyal/unworthy. manwench / regular wench / socket wrench, provided excellent courtship and courteousness - even after all my lame puns and medieval mockery.

\"what sort of magic is this ?!\" - me

*eye roll from bar maid* 

i truly recommend visiting the castle next royal gahering - although i held my tounge in the kings presence, i must admit that in my heart of hearts, the show - despite being spectacularly corny and fun - deserves a much needed overhaul. 

a new food menu couldn't hurt - but i would not wish for the chef to be sent to the dungeon for introducing such sorcery as \"beef sliders\" to the king. i would no wish such fate against my archist of nemesisesess's !

{"text":"Oh my I Absolutely love Medieval Times! Ive been here like 6 times. Whenever I have visitors or Im asked out, yes on a date,75% of the time this is where I want to go. The food, yummy to my tummy honestly! The portion size is so much. The chicken and dessert are my favourite, its just sooo good. If It wasnt so fulling I would ask for seconds, or thirds....The entertainment is so much fun, I love the challenge.Only drawback...the wait. They usually tell you to arrive an hour before your show and because I know im having a big meal I don't eat to much during the day. So you end up starving...Maybe thats why the foods so good, no just joking.Im going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's great to visit every few years. Love the chicken, Love the potatoes, Love the wine. Great staff.

It's fun to people watch here as well. Many weirdos, many interesting, many sophisticated people Hah"}
{"text":"If you've never been to Medieval Times, then yes -- you should go. It's something I've always been intrigued by and had the chance to go to a friend's birthday party. Everything was a new experience, and it did bring me back to being a kid who was into knights and dragons.

I'm easily entertained, so getting beer in gigantic plastic cups and watching a hawk terrifyingly circle people's heads is a fun experience. The food wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, and alcohol paired with jousting is a winning combination.

The second time I went here -- not so much. I knew the script they act in front of you (minus the ad-libs) and what to expect in general as far as entertainment. Once you take that out of the equation the whole thing is kinda boring. And you realise the food might not be as good as you remember it. I also found the second time around I paid attention to the prices more closely -- it's not cheap!

Overall, I have to recommend Medieval Times to anyone thinking of going. I highly suggest going with several other people to make things more fun. Certainly not a place to go frequently -- maybe once every few years."}
{"text":"Had already experienced Medieval Times in Orlando on a business trip quite a few years ago. This time decided to take the kids while visiting Toronto. My experience was was better on the \"spectacle\" side, maybe because the kids really got into it and enjoyed the show, but food wise it was lacklustre. Acceptable but not great, and it has nothing to do with having to eat with your hands (the kids got a kick out of that as well). The taste of all servings was rather bland, even the beer. All in all a fun experience, but if I was just rating on the food it would get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I think Medieval Times is a great place to go for kids and as a one-time thing to experience something new.  I won't come again because it is too expensive. 

I used to think this place was only for kids and was actually surprised that most of the people were actually adults celebrating birthdays, engagements, graduations, etc. I came here for a birthday celebration. We were a party of 10. The show started at 7:30pm and ended around 10pm. It's a really long show mainly of horses doing little dances. There was jousting towards the end of the show. 

The food was good and portions were huge. Meat eaters eat chicken with their hands accompanied by bread, corn, potatoes, etc. I think part of the appeal of Medieval times is eating with your hands. I got the vegetarian option which included hummus/carrot/celery dip, rice with potatoes & lentils. Dessert was a pecan tart. 

we paid the extra $16 for the celebration package which included a group photo, extra cake (I didn't even touch because I was too full), front row seats (there are only 5 rows, not really much of a difference), and some other perks. Next time I'd skip out on the birthday package (that is, if there is a next time)."}
{"text":"I just went to Medieval Times on Saturday. Haven't been there since I was 10. I can say the experience was just as great as my foggy memories suggested.

The food was average but not bad at all. It's kinda interesting to eat everything with your hands. The waiters were also pretty cool about calling the soup \"dragon's blood\" and the chicken \"baby dragon\". It sounds a little cheesy but I love it. It's Medieval Times, we're here for a pretend jousting tournament. Hamming it up is great!

But you come here for the entertainment and if you like horses and knights and a little comedy mixed in you're in the right place. The \"actors\" get into their role and I found them quite a joy to listen to. Our yellow knight was especially good at making subtle in character actions both to the audience and to the other knights. He got cheered on accordingly by our section. Which is another thing: you better GET LOUD. Don't go here and sit quietly. You cheer on your knight and raise your cup like you mean it. It makes the experience that much better.

On the subject of cups... This place has a TERRIBLE beer selection. You get Keith's, Bud Light, Budweiser, or Stella Artois. That's it. It's a little embarrassing to be in Canada with a selection like that.

Beer selection notwithstanding, the experience was great and I would definitely like to go again."}

Medieval Times has been on Brad's bucket list. So when we saw a groupon for it, we had to go!

I was very disappointed to find that it was $11 for parking. I'm already paying a lot for the dinner and show. It started me off very bitter.

When we got in, Brad and I decided to have a few drinks. This was expensive but I knew it would be. The cocktails were great!

We got a seat right in the front which was a part of an upgrade we got.

Watching the show it was great! Exactly what I thought it would be. I especially loved the falcon trick. Our knight interacted with the crowd a lot which I liked.

For food - the soup was very good! I also liked the chicken and corn. Though I thought the chicken was a little dry, but I was okay with that. I wasn't a fan of the potato though. I liked eating with my hands but the people next to us got forks and knives. That was kind of lame haha.

I thought it was great. Brad said it \"Surpassed his expectations\" he loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I find it so funny, but I start laughing every time I think about my server telling me, \"we have Pepsi, milord.\" 

Our (blue) knight was out pretty quickly. That was disappointing. The food is sub-par to average. Nothing is mind blowing, nothing is atrocious. The chicken was bland, and everything was kind of lukewarm to cool. But whatevs, I had my crown, my Pepsi, and a pretty girl (milady) next to me.

The battle scenes are only (moderately) impressive the first time around. The plot twist in the show is kind of obvious, and I know it would be terribly unexciting to sit through it again. Maybe I'm just spoiled now after reading/watching A Game of Thrones. There's no rogueish imp to love, no petulant teenage king to hate; just some boy-faced knights doin' their choreographed thang. It's goofy and fun, but only in that moment.

I feel for the service staff. They have to keep referring to everyone they see as lords and ladies; \"milady, you cannot stand in front of that banner, it's where you take photographs.\" They're really trying to drive home the whole peasant/wench bit, while probably having a crushing desire to end their lives. Our server seemed to really get into it, but for all I know, he could have been going off into the back to cry while getting my Pepsi.

I can't remember there being (too much of) an issue with parking, but we also got there fairly early. 

It's one of those things that you should go to at least once to experience it. Unless you're a child filled with wide-eyed wonder and whimsy (or an adult with anterograde amnesia), I can't imagine you'll want to make a habit of it though. It gets old. Fast. 

Kate H. has a review that is so on point that I felt the urge to copy and paste it."}
{"text":"For adults, I recommend you pre party before arrival then taxi over to the arena. We arrived 20 mins before the show and got amazing seats!

Its a tourist trap so they will attempt to sell you everything. 

My sister and I got the Royalty Package which included Premium Seating (first row in in black and white section), commemorative program, cheering banner, souvenir cup and DVD.

We decided to go, because of the scenes from the Cable Guy!!!! It was just like that!

I LOVE a good show, this show was awesome, even as we started to sober up. The battles are choreographed so dont go there expecting Bravehart or Gladiator...have an openmind and allow yourself to enjoy the experience.

A must see, at least once."}
{"text":"This was our visit to Medieval Times Toronto, and my family really enjoyed the food, service and show. The 1/2 roasted chicken was juicy and flavorful, as was all the food.  The service was prompt and courteous. The show, from the gorgeous and graceful horses, to the talented knights, was entertaining. Yes, the show was scripted, but isn't most theater?  All and all, the show was loads of fun!  It's worth a visit !"}
{"text":"I went with a school group at lunch time years ago.  It was my first time and I have no interest in going back.. Not sure if it was the fact it was all school kids or what but I found it really hokey and a money grabber.  People were coming around during the show to try to sell merchandise to kids!  It was expensive for a school day trip as well."}
{"text":"This is not a cheep night of entertainment by any means.  You start off with a pretty expensive base price ticket, but wait.. you can for $12 more upgrade to get to check in a faster, but for another $30 you get front row seating.  All this online and all but the most savvy are thinking they are getting something special.  Nope.  After clicking and scrolling you get chicken, potato, bread, a piece of corn and a desert plus two beverages..

Ok, so it will be a fun. I guess as you are getting entertainment..  so you lay out your credit card and book.  Oh yea, there is a $4 per person convenance surcharge (and the convenience actually is for the theatre owners and clearly not yours).  And then there is the parking.  In bold letting free parking but an asterisk for except the Toronto location .. btw, the parking is $12.

So you get inside after waiting in a line where the attendants are very ineffective and even though you have your tickets in hand that you paid your convenience charge for, they still need to something off to the side so you might as well bought at the door.  And you get inside to a big hall where they are pushing you now to buy flashy light swords.. I swear it's just like going to the circus just 10x more expensive.

So you wait and perhaps even buy an overpriced beer to pass the time.  Hope you paid extra for the VIP as you are now stuck in a mass hoard of bodies trying to get in through two small doors with confusing directions from staff.  You eventually find your table row that is basically a long Woden table with people's gum stuck underneath because the staff likely doesn't clean it till someone complains, and folding metal chairs.  Ok... but it's going to be a good show and a reasonable meal.  

The show starts but you are left rather confused as where to look and inadequate sound system.  You have a server who might or in our case might not bother to bring you food in a timely fashion.. like you are trying to watch the king at the other end of the massive hall but the server is standing in front of you asking d you want soup.  yes I do.  You do know you are using your hands, so try not to burn your mouth on the soup as you drink it, or you are smart and wait for the twenty plus  minutes for the cold slice of garlic bread if you can call it that to show up.  Then you get your 1/2 a dry chicken, and again get to decide if it's better to wait for who knows how long for the chunk of potato and  1/4 piece of corn on the cob to show up.   As for the beverage, you can have wherever you want just as long as it's Pepsi. Guess that overpriced beer is looking better.  But I don't want a sugar drink, what else's is there?  You can have a glass full of ice with a splash of water...

So you get to force the food down, and then enjoy the show.  The horses were nice.  The feats of valor were in some cases rather predictable but the show portion was entertaining.  They they come around with some really foul tasting coffee and a sticky slice of cake.  Watch the last battle and have the server come by and tell you that even though the food was really basic and the service was shoddy at best, your overpriced meal didn't include any gratuity and we take cash, visa or MasterCard.,

When I did the math it's five stars for the horses but negative three for everything else.  If you don't mind indigestion and really want to see some horses and jousting, then you might like it.  I'd suggest looking up a renaissance festival as you will likely have a much better time, or go to a horse show.. but it was what it was.

Perhaps I just got the bottom of the pile hostess as the one looking after the VIP row in front of me got much better service, and come to think of it so did the row behind me.  But the forgiving family did say they enjoyed themselves, so what can a dad do but go along with it."}
{"text":"We came here as a group for this special event.  We were served with tomato soup first, then softdrink, follow by roasted chicken and a desert.  The show was good, however the food is aweful.  The soup wasn't serve hot.  Seem like the soup been standing for awhile in the kitchen.  The chicken is very dry and it wasn't tasty where I need to add pepper and salt or it.  The desert was over sweeten.  The server was new and inexperienced where she dropped the pitcher of softdrink and hot tea pot in the middle of the show.  Luckily nobody got hurt/wet from the accident.  If it weren't for the show, I would not give 3 stars.  Now that I been to the show, I don't think I will ever come back again."}
{"text":"A visit to medieval times is a must when vacationing with kids in Toronto Ontario, Canada.  There is no guess work about menu its the same everytime for everyone.  The storyline is cheesey dinner theater with an action twist.  The food was good and more than enough to eat for most adults.  Be prepared to be interactive.  All in all a nice night out with a special flare."}
{"text":"I've been to Medieval Times twice and enjoyed it both time.  I get a discount each time I went through my work's corporate code.  It's entertaining and the knights are well trained.  

The amount of food they give you is actually filling.  They service soup, chicken, potatoe and apple pie.  They do not bring you utensils, so you'll have to ask for them. 

The show does get repetitive each time you go, however, different colour knights win each time."}
{"text":"Going to Medieval Times is very nostalgic for me.  I went once when I was in elementary school, during undergrad, and insisted to go for my birthday.

If you are looking to go, they are many different discounts available.  All are listed on their website, but there are also corporate deals.  

Each visit is very similar to the last.  Each meal consists of:garlic bread, tomato bisque soup, roasted chicken, sweet buttered corn, herb-basted potatoes, pastry of the Castle, coffee and two rounds of select beverages.  Vegetarian options are available upon request.  There's also a full bar outside. 

Really the only reason I keep going back is not for the food (which is nothing too spectacular), but for the entertainment.  As cheesy as it may be, I really like how my servers pretend that we were living in the Medieval times, and for the show.  It really gives the experience that we are in the Medieval ages, except that it's more clean and I don't need to dodge people emptying chamber pots."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Mixed feelings really. It's definitely worth a visit if you have kids, but if you're coming with folks not from the city where you as a 24 year old are the youngest...I wouldn't bother.

Medieval Times ran a Victoria Day weekend special where tickets are $20 off their usual prices, at the same time where several of my relatives from Hong Kong came to visit. My aunt (who's from here) decided to treat them to a Medieval Times experience, as we figure it's something that's unique and something you can't experience in HK.

I've been to Medieval Times when I was in elementary school, so I kinda know what to expect. I obviously didn't know better back then, and thought that there was actual death involved when the knights start fighting each other. Unfortunately now that I'm grown up, the whole battle sequence was way too fake and cheesy for my liking...although the kids sitting in the front rows were really engaged.

The food they serve is standard and hasn't changed since my first visit. The tomato bisque was actually quite good, at least it didn't feel canned. The roasted chicken was good except the breast itself, which was way too dry. The buttered corn and baked potato were okay, though personally I rather the buttered corn come in aluminum foil (I understand the whole eating with hands concept, that's fine) cause it got way too messy. The pastries were a bit on the sweet side for my liking.

Our server was very good and we left her a very good tip as a result. I think all the servers in general were very good, and honestly they're probably the most hardworking of the bunch to make sure everything runs smoothly.

If you have kids, especially if they're learning about medieval times, take them here. If you like knights (especially those of Spain and Rome), come here. Otherwise...I'd skip this venue."}
{"text":"It was Family Day weekend so it was super busy. That being said, the service was phenomenal!
While my 4 year old stepson was deciding what he wanted to buy, the lady behind the gift counter was extremely patient and was down at his level to talk to him. She took his money and gave him his change a receipt with a smile and a ton of patience, even with the crowd of people around. She blocked everyone out and focused on him which made him extremely happy.
Our serve Irwin was phenomenal. A great personality and great with the kids. My stepson is a picky eater and Irwin made sure he got enough of what he liked (bread and corn) and slid him an extra dessert with a wink. He made a great experience even better.
The show itself was great, my 6 month old was enthralled with the horses and falcon.
The food was even better than the last time I went (about 8 years ago), and I could not finish my plate as the portions were fairly large.
The only issue I had is we were unable to stop at the gift centers on the way out, meaning we couldn't pick something up even though we told we would be able to. They had blocked it off for the next show so we missed out on getting a gift that was promised.
All in all though, it was a great experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"I had an awesome time being a lady among all of the festivities of the night :-) I really enjoyed the entertainment and food, I really wish there were more themed restaurants with great food, please let me know if you have found one that is awesome!
We had a \"man-wench\" as our server for the night and he was really great, funny and attentive. He gave us extra food when we asked and re-named the food in funny ways, such as \"free-range dragon soup\" instead of tomato soup, I loved it and everyone thought I was a nerd. 
I have been to medieval times before two years ago and nothing has changed, that was a bit of a bummer. I kinda wished they changed up the show or the food, I guess this is just a come once every couple of years kinda thing. Although, I wish to be a princess everyday!"}
{"text":"What an adventure! My wife and I were here to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary and we were very excited, seeing as we are big fans of Game of Thrones. We have attended dinner theatres before, but never anything quite as extravagant as this. I highly recommend showing up early so that you can explore all the gift shops and the torture museum. Everyone is dressed and stayed in character the whole time, and the actors were all absolutely fantastic. The food was very classic; we had a tomato bisque, a quarter chicken, a piece of buttered corn on the cob, a potatoes halve lightly spiced, and a tart for dessert. Everything is eaten with your hands, there are no utensils. The show was BREATHTAKING. The horses and falcon are all extremely well trained, and the knights and squires make the fights look real."}
{"text":"Got the vip package so we didn't have to go early and reserve seats and also so we get front row seats. I did not like how they cram as many people as they possibly can onto each row. If you're in the middle and needed to use the bathroom you're going to have to climb your chair to get out. 

Our server was super enthusiastic and friendly. Service was great although it does seem like they rush you when you're eating to get to the next item on the menu. I guess it's because the entire experience runs on a schedule. And I'm a slow eater so that doesn't help. 

The show was spectacular and it's so engaging. I also love how the performers interact with the audience as much as they can. I would give the show a 5/5. 

Food was decent. Nothing too great but some things did taste really good. Loved the tomato bisque And the corn that came with the chicken. Chicken was well seasoned and a good size. I give the food a 3.5/5. 

One thing I really can't get over is that there is no family washroom. I was with an individual of the opposite gender with a disability with me and it was not possible to let him into the mens washroom alone with a big crowd. A family washroom would come in a handy at this point. I eventually told a staff there of our situation and they were able to help although we had to wait a while. They really need a family washroom to accommodate the diverse population. 

Overall, I give this whole experience a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! The show was freakin awesome! The actors were quite convincing and barely broke character, even before the show while doing pictures and knighting ceremonies. The food was good and the wenches were fast and efficient. I highly recommend the celebration package for birthday parties. You will not be disappointed. It's a little on the expensive side but absolutely worth it. The whole thing is superb!"}
{"text":"This was a huge let down for me the other weekend. 

Unknowingly, we went on an evening with a bunch of schools attending so even though we got there right as the doors opened, so our seats were in the very last row, in one of the corners of the stadium. If you are stuck in that spot, you are already in a bit of a crap situation, but it only got worse after being seated. 

We were the only table within my view eating off of paper plates. Everyone else had actual plates and bowls (as a Yelper has posted pictures), but we got disposables. Apparently they ran out of clean dishes. Okay. When you are paying $70 a head, you like to at least feel like the meal is worth eating off of actual dinnerware. 

The schools in front of us were rowdy, and in most cases at Medieval Times this would be awesome - but they were standing up to watch the show and yelling non-stop. We couldn't hear any of the commentary of the show, nor could we actually see the show when they were standing. I'm surprised their servers didn't take care of this, as I'm sure they know it is nearly impossible to see when people are standing in front of you. Eventually I rained on their parade and told the students that none of us could see the show. I wish I went and talked to them earlier though - by then it was about 3/4 of the way through the show. 

The meal itself was pretty good. What I would expect out of such an event. The chicken was nicely seasoned and I loved the ribs. My server was very nice and tried to make the best out of our bad seating situation. 

What I saw of the show was entertaining, but having a closer seat would have made the world of a difference in my opinion. 

Avoid the pre-show drinks. I think I paid $5 for a coke. Really."}
{"text":"This is an amazing show! I strongly suggest to anyone. I have seen it twice, first time in Toronto in 2007 and I loved it! 2nd time in California - and it was not that great.
Toronto arena was much bigger, all horses were so beautiful. They served really good food (huge portions) and drinks.
I loved the show, story and all the sword fights, it was really great show. This show is the best show I have ever seen in my life.
During show each color knight chooses a girl and gives her \"Queen of Love & Beauty\" ribbon (I got one, yeey) and they bring you a picture of that moment later. Pictures are really expensive, of course, $20 bucks each. But after show you can go and take your own pictures with each character, king, queen and princess, bought a sword and each knight signed it, he was very happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I are on a Staycation in Toronto and had an absolute blast tonight at Medieval Times. He didn't know much about it beforehand, and I think it was good thing because it meant he had no expectations. He loved it and so did I!
Drinks were great, pre-show entertainment was good, and then we were ushered into the arena. We sat in the 3rd row of the green section - not bad seats!
Dinner was better than I remembered (I'd been there 10 years ago) and everything was very hot and flavourful. Good hot soup, tasty moist chicken, tender rib, and well seasoned potato. Dessert leaves a little to be desired, but it was nice to have a cup of tea with my apple pastry.
All in all, a great night, lots of fun, and exceptionally entertaining. It wasn't even that we had to \"make ourselves\" have fun, it just was fun!
If you can get a good deal on it, it's worth going."}
{"text":"Pros
Good food
Extremely helpful staff
Different experience than usual
Good for family with children 


Cons
Expensive 
No forks. Supposed to give real feel but I don't think I enjoyed it
Show got boring by the end (personal opinion). I think it is for kids

Repeat? Well, not until i have children"}
{"text":"I like medieval  things so i brought a few of my kids to here the knights put on a show.  There were a few things I didn't like.  Thing I least enjoyed that night was you could pay the staff and they will give you a cheap plug for your company or your birthday.  A person reads it out and it gets annoying especially the second time around.  I wish they had given us tomatoes so we could throw it at him like in medieval times. They did that pre show and during the halfway mark.  Its like putting ads into a show your already paying 45 dollars for.  They are also selling pictures, where they will come to you during the show to see if you would like to purchase the photo that you have taken.

The food was ok, not great.  Chicken, a piece of rib, garlic toast, soup, and a drink of water or pepsi, gets refilled once.  Children gets the same size as adults.

The 3 stars i gave was for the knights performing, sure the strikes are a little delayed, but its a show, you don't want them to get seriously hurt.  They battle a few times each, and each knight represents a section in the crowd.

They waitress serving me was ok, wasn't the fastest of the waiters that night, but good enough.

Overall, it was okay, the knights are stunt fighting but they try to at least make it believable.  The food was hot and fresh, even though it didn't taste that good.  Maybe they didn't have enough spices and herbs during medieval times.  They bummer part was the cheap plugs, and the effort of the place to try to milk your money."}
{"text":"Love the experience ! It's like being taken back to the times of kings, queens , knights and the round table. They try to make the experience as authentic as possible , except maybe the look of the  souvenir stalls . The family loved it, enjoyed both the fares and the entertainment. My mom was raving about it. She was practically like a talking marketing ad to my sisters and her friends. I probably should collect a professional fee for her at the rate she was going. The horses were a sight to see. You can see that they're well groomed and taken care of which of course is a good sign. Food was good too , quite better than what I had expected. Portions were not bad. I liked everything that was served tomato bisque, roasted chicken, baked potatoes & tart for dessert. definitely a place you need to bring your guests over. It will be an experience they will not forget. I'd come back just not maybe another couple more years."}
{"text":"Took my friend from out of town here and we kinda got a \"it's very family oriented place\" because of the number of families even tho we went to the latest show. Show was actually really good and fun to watch, food wise it was good tasting but I don't think you get enough food. 

You have to pay for alcoholic drinks that's kinda expensive a glass of wine was $11. 

Overall great for families and a great way to spend a night of you haven't seen been there but there's a hefty price of at least $60 per ticket plus alcohol and specialty drinks."}
{"text":"finally went here for the first time! So cool, was a bit odd eating with my hands but ultimately it was such a great show and you can drink as well! Personally I love horses so it was very entertaining for me because of that :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to write this review in two parts. 

Part one - GUEST EXPERIENCE: 

Medieval Times is so much fun, not just for kids but adults (and rowdy young adults) too! I've been twice - once for a birthday party (an adults birthday party, to be clear...) and once with a private event. Both times the food impressed me and the shows did too. I love that the actors are passionate about their jobs and take pride in putting on a good show (ok - I talk to the animal people a LOT when I have the chance!). I love that the show fits all ages because there are components for all ages. AND I love that it is a damn good meal! The portions are great, and yes the cocktails with \"keepsake\" glasses are ridiculously expensive, but you can get a bottle of wine for under $30! 

Disclaimer: I\"m not saying a GOOD bottle of wine, but I assure you the show is MUH better with my good friend alcohol. 

Part two - PRIVATE EVENT VENUE:

We have booked out the entirety of Medieval Times for an event and they do a fabulous job. They are so accommodating, and really, if you're looking for a venue that holds that many people, the price is right. They are so professional and get all of your guests through registration quickly - AND they will do passed hors d'oeuvres, drink tickets, and anything else you might require! 


Overall, everyone enjoys Medieval Times, tourists and Torontonians alike. I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Many a times we've been.. march break they had knight training... it was a 10 minutes stint with swords for the kids. It was fun, but the 45 minute wait after wasn't so pleasant. 

We were on team black and white almost as good as team awesome or Power... but alas B&W lost to green, st paddy's day rigging they let green win the tournament...  

Dan our man wench(lol) was great and fruity ale for st pats was great... if it was one of my previous visits with wins under the belt I would have given it a 4... 

But for whatever reason, today's experience maybe cause Jayden caught a rose, omg, happiest kid in town.. giving it a 5...

Had to listen Hayden for those 45 minutes, buy me this buy me that... told him he could get a tiara, haha... great time
Lots of laughs

God save Ireland !! 
See you next time...
Cheers!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and the whole family and had an awesome time! The show was amazing and we enjoyed the extra participation of cheering for our knight. Entertainment was par excellence, but the food could use some improvement. It's acceptable though, since Medieval Times is not primarily a restaurant. The tomato soup was cold and the chicken needed more seasoning, but I did enjoy the rib and herbed potato, and most especially the apple strudel a.k.a. pastry of the castle. Coffee was terrible, but then again it's not a cafe. Overall though, the entire experience of attending a joust and being served a full meal is wonderful. I would love to come here again!"}
{"text":"I scoured the interwebs for a restaurant that was out of the ordinary - a dining venue that would entertain not only my 60-something parents, but also my hyperactive 4-yr-old nephew. 

Medieval TImes sounded like the type of place that could do just that, and despite the hefty per person price tag, it succeeded in keeping us fairly entertained.

Here's my review in bite-size pieces (no pun intended):

Staff: The staff at the ticket booth/entrance/gift stalls looked bored and energy-deprived. Fortunately, the wait staff inside the arena more than made up for it...despite their constant, borderline-annoying \"my Lord/my Lady\" greetings.

Food: Quick tip = Take your appetite with you! In keeping with a medieval-style gorge fest, the portions are fairly large. No time to pace yourself here - the ribs and baked potato were plonked down on my plate before I got through half of the roasted half-chicken. As for the quality of the food? Well, it may not be fit for a king, but its perfect for his minions, whose primary role here is to cheer loudly for their section-assigned brave knight (in my case, the green one - who ended up being the douche that kidnapped the prince).

Beverages: $7.50 gets you a Canadian brew and a souvenir cup. The big spenders can opt for a variety of memorabilia beer steins and the like.

Entertainment: Plenty of jousting, melodrama, horsey tricks, and fight scenes. The show was a little too long for my liking (there's only so much medieval I can appreciate), but the actors do come out after the dinner show for photos and autographs...which is nice. 

The fact that the knights are rather dishy is also VERY NICE.

Overall: I give this a 3.5 out of 5. It's a great dining experience for kids (the little ones actually do sit and watch the entire show), but tickets are a little too overpriced when considering the overall experience."}
{"text":"FUN, UNIQUE EXPERIENCE BUT EXPENSIVE 

Medieval Times is definitely a fun and unique experience. You really can't go anywhere else for jousting fights, sword-fighting knights, wench servers, etc.. Food was decent, not outstanding or anything. Alcoholic cocktails were decent too, kinda expensive. Nevertheless, I did have a fun time and the entertainment from start-to-finish was a blast. Most likely won't visit again due to the regular price. Definitely a must-try though, at least visit once!"}
{"text":"Do you like a good Joust? Do you want to channel your inner King Henry the VIII and eat with your hands like a boorish slob ? Like watching swarthy flowing locked men on horseback? Then Medieval times is for you.

I asked hubby to take me here for my B-day as I love anything novel or cheeseball and have actually returned a couple times therafter to enjoy the Medieval-esque delights.  No, there were no sightings of Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein or roaring intros by Chaucer, but there is some awesome mock/choreagraphed spark igniting sword fighting.   Ahem no, not THAT kind of sword fighting :D

The Middle age style \"bar\" is the place to hang out before the show. Hubby wasn't too keen on the beer selection as it was generic and overpriced.  He was also quite dissappointed  that there was no old school mead to be served.

Once seated inside the auditorium in orderly fashion the meal is very efficiently and professionally doled out by minions of servitude. The meal itself is meh and starts with a hard crusted margarine soaked (eck) garlic toast with canned style  minestrone  soup served in a handled bowl made for sipping, followed by a quarter chicken plus ribs combo with an over season salted halved potato  and to finish tea or coffee with an anti-climactic dessert of a petrified supermarket variety apple turnover...think next time I'll try the veggie option as I'm told it's delicious and less hum-drum than the carnivorous meal.

Less than stellar food aside the reason to come to Medieval Times is for the gallant revelry and ribaldry of the various acts,  my favorite of which is the Falconry. I'm always impressed at how disciplined this majestic bird is as it swoops over the audience, completely focused on it's gloved master and never shats or tries to eat the guests' food. The beautiful Spanish horses doing dressage tricks is also quite engaging.

Fair warning to husbands, boyfriends or fathers, lock your wives, girlfriends or daughters up as Medieval Times may unleash their deep seated knight fetish and in some cases they may go apeshit for the virile lads on horseback.  The first time we came this crazy fangirl who sat across us, kept cheeringing, nay screeching at her assigned knight to win at his challenges and nearly fell over the edge of the wall barrier from her raucous show of affection while her red faced, embarrassed boyfriend kept trying to contain her medieval madness. 

I noticed the evening performances brings out a more barbaric audience as we witnessed half enebriated college boys heckling the performers yelling \"Treason and Treachery\" to the evil knight and sending loud shout outs of \"You're Hot!!!\" to the princess.  The Cable Guy was not wrong in it's portrayal of Medieval Times nutty fandom as there is clearly a cult following that is as entertaining to watch as the show itself.  

Cost wise it is a bit pricey, as a package for two could run you close to $ 75/ person ( best to keep tabs via Facebook/Twitter for deal alerts)  but remember that you are paying for a meal, workers wages and a performance plus for the upkeep of the pretty horses.  It's something out of the ordinary and it's not the most epicurean experience, but for what it's worth I'd say that Medieval Times is a royally good tyme.  Fie indeed!"}
{"text":"* This review is full of important tips*.  HALAL option is available when you request it at least a week ahead.

You must arrive as soon as the doors open to get a closer seat. Tables are assigned when you check in.  You find a colored cheering section for your knight.

To get a birthday announcement it is $ $10. To be knighted it is an additional $10 and that takes place in the main lobby before the show. A really great photo with the king is included.

Aside from this, they overcharge for things like taking a photo with a princess for like $20.

The meal includes roast vegetable soup, half a roast chicken, half a roast potato, half of corn, soda, and late: tea or coffee, and a dessert. Food is well seasoned and tasty.

NOTE: wash your hands before because they don't provide knives and forks. Bring your own if you want. However they give you wet naps after to wipe your hands.
Parking is $12 and the entrance is quite a walk from the back. You have to walk all the way around the building to the front.

This is fun for family evening out.  Search online to get a a deal if you can because it's kind of pricey!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Medieval times due to purchasing a groupon! Quite amazed to see more adults than children (maybe due to our timing - 7.30 pm show). Great entertainment & food! Our server Peter was amazing & really worked for his tip!! I would recommend anyone to go for the fun factor!"}
{"text":"The food is adequate but the show is excellent. Lots of pageantry beautiful horses and sword fighting, what more can you ask for? Well better food"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at medieval times and it was a night to remember. 

Food: the meal was pretty standard but the portions are huge. You start off with a tomato bisque soup and garlic bread. For the main they serve you a three piece chicken, ribs, and roasted potatoes. I don't eat pork so the server brought me an extra potato and garlic bread. If you like blander food (Swiss chalet) you will enjoy this meal. The only thing is they serve each portion of your meal one item  at a time instead of serving the entire dish. So everyone receives chicken, then everyone receives ribs then everyone receives a potato. So be patient. Oh and there are no utensils but they provide everyone with wet wipes.

Show: overall the show was very interactive and entertaining. The first half of the show is an introduction of characters and tricks with the animals. I'm not a huge fan of using animals for entertainment so I definitely enjoyed the second half of the show better. The second half of the show is when the battling begins and the plot thickens. I really enjoyed the fake fighting and cheering on the knights. 

Service: they are very organized considering everyone has different request. My server was all smiles all night he did a great job tending to such a large section

Cons: washroom was absolutely gross. I won't even mention what I saw in there. Also, I ordered some type of strawberry piña colada drink and it was so sweet it was sickly I couldn't even drink it. I feel like they but minimum amount of alcohol in our drinks. I would stick to beer or a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"This is one of those once in a few years type of place. It was quite pricey a few years back, but now there's always deals. If you check Groupon, I've seen it a couple of times.

The show was entertaining and the food was decent. I felt a little uncivilized eating with my unwashed bare hands. Luckily, I had wipes. So wash your hands before going in.

Eating with you're hands is part of the Medieval experience so enjoy it!

They have a souvenir room to keep you occupied while waiting for the show to begin. That's where I emptied my wallet.. so keep your money and credit cards at home! (Especially if you have kids)

Overall, we had a good time. Wonderful place for kids and groups."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of medieval times. I think Toronto needs more dinners/shows like this.
My group came on the new years seasonal promotion so it was roughly $45 a person. The meal began with a soup, which i probably enjoyed the most, then a slice of garlic bread, half a chicken, one rib, half a roasted potato, and then a piece of cake and apple danish for dessert. non alcoholic beverages being served were pepsi, diet pepsi, 7 up, and water. as well as coffee or tea after you finished your entree.

the food itself is pretty mediocre but you tend to forget about it because you're having such a good time cheering for your knight while booing the others.

my group was seated in the green section along with a few other big parties who were of age to drink and were a bit rowdy which made it that much more fun. our section was easily the loudest and the green knight just loved every bit of it. The red and yellow knight however got the bad end of the stick because we just booed the heck out of him for no good reason.

The best part about it all was that our \"Green Machine\" chants that filled the stadium paid off in the end as the Green Knight was deemed the champion. After the dinner and show, we also got a picture with the Green Knight.
All in all a fun experience. If the quality of the food was better, I'd give Medieval Times 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to Medieval Times dinner and Tournament.  First two times I came I used a Groupon.  I would recommend buying a Groupon.  Without it can be quite pricy.  Parking is $12 and they recommend you come at least 60-90 minutes before the show. If you come early you can park closer to the entrance.  Also the line ups is crazy long.  It's a first come first serve basis so if you come later you'll sit further away.  If you get there early you can walk around and look at the horse stables and take pictures.  Also if you're celebrating a Birthday you can buy a Birthday package and they'll announce your name and and you get to wear a crown and take a picture with the king. You can opt to pay extra and get VIP tickets which is front row.  The room is divided into sections.  You'll be assigned a colour and the knight that you're routing for would be the same colour.  The show is fun for the kids.  The horses does tricks as well.  Food wise it's ok.  You get tomato soup to start with garlic bread.  Then you get half a chicken, half a baked potato and a small piece of corn.  Dessert this time around was a lemon pound cake.  I did noticed this time around the food got worst.  The last two times we got ribs.  Also the last two times the dessert was much better.  I had homemade Pecan tarts before.  The only reason why we came this time was because my company hosted a Children's Christmas party at Medieval Times.  This will be my last visit here. I feel like the food got worst each time I visited and the performance was not as fun as it was the last two times."}
{"text":"This place kinda sucks if you're over the age of ten, but gets slightly better with each drink you consume. 

Luckily we swung by after a long day of beers at the BMO field so we it wasn't as off-putting as it could have been when we entered a room filled with overpriced tacky sparkly souvenirs, medieval decor, and hordes of yelling (or crying if their parents wouldn't buy them a $2487057 souvenir) children running around like maniacs. 

Spotting the bar with our excellent radar skills, we purchased the biggest beer they had - a $25 beer that came in a wonderfully fancy and equally tacky medieval times beer stein. 

The show itself is lame, but if you drink enough and have fun enough friends, you can make a game our of out-screaming the kids during the show.

Food is actually pretty decent and there is no shortage of it. They come around and take drink orders too so you don't have to leave your seat at all and keep running to the bar.

Service is kinda slow tho, so bulk order or you may not see your server for a while..

We got it on a travel zoo deal so price wasn't bad - about $37 per person - but I wouldn't go back. Too many kids, too noisy & too pricey."}
{"text":"My second time, kids loved it that's because I have it a 4 star, but I am not that crazy about it. Dinner wasn't good at all, but I guess it's better than nothing. Poor selection of drinks and a bit over priced."}
{"text":"As a child I attended this dinner tournament. Now as an adult when some of my friends suggested it, I was up for the adventure.

majestic af.

I'm not sure what the vegetarian options would be, but the half chicken consumed by ripping with hands was great. As my friend commented about the chicken and potato, \"do you have any Ye Ole Hot Sauce?\" 

If you by a reusable stein, refills of beer are less than a jays game. Their tap list was something to be desired... big brands of pasteurized ice-cold soulless shit. They need ALES. That would pair well with the jousting, sword fights, and food consumption via hands. They didn't have lagers and refrigerators back in those times... or microphones or indoor plumbing, haha 

The theatrics of the tournament and the styling of this event were entertaining to adult-self as much as they where when i was a youth. 

If you love GOT and stepping into another era, definitely hit up here."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends 26th birthday! It was a group of 7.
As soon as you get there they put you in the mood of the Medieval Times!
We were told to come early (615pm) but show started at 730pm. There were a tone of people who pre paid for their tickets online which I do recommend so you get seats together.

After we got into the bar/waiting area there was a mini show put on while we waited to go in. It was ok. They called out birthday parties and any special events happening. Everyone got HUGE beers and stood around.
There were TONES of souvenirs and stuff for u to buy while you waited to go into the arena. PRICEY! 

We finally got in and the place wasn't as big as it looks on t.v ..
We were squished together on these  chairs and could barley move!
The server was VERY NICE!
The food- huge portions!!
Very good show!
Very fun!
I would definitely go back!
Once the show begins you forget how squished you are because they really interact and  involve the crowd!"}
{"text":"This was a high energy and fun night!!! Show was about 2 or 2 1/2 hours. Went as a date night, but one could definitely bring the kids. Don't be timid! The more you cheer the more fun it is for everyone. With the exchange rate of Us higher than CAN, don't hesitate to go now! There's a lot of great coupons out there and the exchange rate makes it that much less expensive. Looked great for groups! But arrive and get your table together, as it is assigned seating once you get in. We sat next to a group that was split. The food was good, served promptly and they have their serving strategies down so you don't miss any action. The knights are very talented, I enjoyed the agility challenges."}
{"text":"A more-or-less eyerolling spectacle replete with \"authentic\" cuisine and Ren-faire dialogue from your servers. The food is put together as though by dimwitted serfs: a half-chicken, a single beef rib, a half-potato, and what I was sure was Campbell's vegetable soup. I snagged a giant beer for a MERE $24. At least you get to keep the glass.

As for the show, it's NASCAR for renaissance nerds. Go with kids or a blood alcohol level over 0.09.

Obligatory Title Pun: TIMES to get outta here.

Menu Readability: The \"bill of fare\" is printed on the inside of the napkin.  If I was a lesser man I would say: \"cute!\"

Need to mention: There is a vegetarian option. I've heard it's quite good, actually.

What this place teaches me about myself: We wore red clothing, red crowns, and cheered for the red knight -- all from the yellow section. I like to cause trouble."}
{"text":"My first time to a place like this. I had the most fun ever. The price to start had me concerned then once I walked in I realized it was well worth it. A dinner and a show. The actors played their rolls amazingly. Had the crowd interactive and focused on the children. After dinner we had fun taking pictures and chatting with them. The humor was continuous and made the night awesome. A great travel through time and to catch a glimpse of what history has to teach us. Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"The price isn't bad at all. You're getting a full meal plus entertainment. The tournament was fun to watch. The food was decent. What was hard to watch was the horses performing tricks. I just hope they treat the horses really well behind the scenes."}
{"text":"I have never been so retro-actively angry at my parents as I was when I was at Medieval Times. 

When I was wee we lived in the UK, and at the age of four I used to regularly watch PBS-style programming on Tudor England. I was obsessed. \"Where do you think young Elizabeth was when her mommy was beheaded? I think I'd hide under the bed...\" and other such things were apparently said on the regular. So imagine how pissed I was when I realized I spent my whole childhood not being taken to Medieval Times or similar such places. 

The good news is, this ridiculous Toronto staple is just as fun for adults. First you walk in and it's all souvenirs, trumpeters, swords and a bar. So we bought some novelty cups and started drinking. I then decided to upgrade my paper crown to a princess thingy, which I *will* wear again. 

You're then ushered into the show. I highly recommend red, because it's the best colour and our knight won, and I have a feeling they actually don't switch it up that often (sorry to ruin the magic). The food got progressively worse as the night went on, but the garlic bread, tomato soup and chicken were actually totally fine. Just keep on drinking and don't get too excited about desert, because it's brutal. 

This place is too expensive. I question the quality of the lives of the horses. It is packed with too many children's birthday parties and acts as a sort of birth control. You simply have to go, Lords and Ladies."}
{"text":"As far as experience, it is what it is. What is awful is that they charge 26% tax! There is no mention of any \"ticket fees\" anywhere on their pricing page. In the final step of paying they have \"taxes and fees\" added in, like any receipt, but at a rate of 26%, not Ontario's 13%. 

They are adding a 13% fee without disclosing it anywhere, and attempting to hide it in the HST item on the receipt. The receipt does the same trick (which is illegal under CRA's HST guidelines)."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Medieval Times, and I am so glad I did! We don't have children - we're just too adult dorks who love things like this. :)

If you're driving, there's a parking lot for Medieval Times and the entrance is just west of the building - it costs $11.00 (on a Friday evening), so prepare for that.

If you have an iPhone, you might have trouble showing your tickets on your mobile. We did, as it requires Java to pull them up, so consider printing your tickets. As it is, they were understanding and offered to print our tickets, but told us as we had the celebration package, we could go to the desk and tell them and didn't need our tickets. That worked great!

The souvenirs are pretty expensive, and they have a cash bar, so bring money if you want drinks and to buy from the numerous gift counters. We got seated first, and in the front row, which was awesome.

 Throughout the show, they have a \"wench\" or \"serf\" serve you, a \"barmaid\" comes around to see if you want drinks, and numerous merchants walk around with things to entice your kids. A photographer will also come around and take your photo, which they will ask if you want to buy them. 

The show is great, and the food is actually REALLY good! You get pop or water, tomato soup, garlic bread, chicken, half a roasted potato, a piece of corn on the cob, tea or coffee before dessert, and then the current pastry they are serving. Ours was a sort of tart. I was really impressed with their food! 

If you join the birthday fellowship online, you can get a ticket free for your birthday, which is what I did. We also upgraded our tickets to the celebration package, so for 2 adults (with a free basic birthday tickets plus upgrade), our total was about $132 for tickets. We both felt the price and the upgrade was totally worth it.

Although everyone was kind and friendly, there were 2 standout employees for us - Shawn and Heidi, a serf and a wench. They were amazing, just friendly and charismatic and they made our evening even better.  I was really impressed with them.

I'd definitely go back in the future. Great experience!"}
