{"text":"Amazing everything. I hope I can find something like this place in the gta. A true montreal staple."}
{"text":"Fantastic, flavourful, fast and fresh! We had a Pabellon (beef, black bean and feta), Llanera (beef, feta and avocado) and Cazon (tomotatoey shark meat that's like tuna) with a side of plantain. They all came freshly prepared and was very very tasty pockets packed with flavour! There were exotic juices on the non-alcoholic menu, which was refreshing. Go for guava rather than the tamarind though. Great little place with nice decor and a real family-run feel. A little gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, and kind people with good service. Ordered the bean, feta, and plantain arapera with cassava fries and avocado dip. I highly recommend this restaurant if you have the chance."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The food is fresh and flavours refreshing. Not diet restricted myself but had a friend with me who was very impressed and ate happily with a good deal of choice still. I plan to come back here the chorizo was great.
Finally can't thank them for service enough the owner is a fantastic dude with a great staff. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits and it payed off in the experience!"}
{"text":"Very good Venezuelan food with an affordable price. Not a fan of their salad but a huge fan of their spicy sauce! Portion size is right for a light lunch/dinner. Try those with fried plantain inside if you enjoy sweet and salty together!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed on my last visit to Areperas... I ordered number 31 which is a vegan arepas under the vegan list on the menu. This comes with the regular salad that comes with every sandwich. Well my arepas was vegan but I started eating my salad and realized the avocado sauce was a little creamy. I asked the waitress and it turns out that there is mayonnaise in the avocado sauce. Why the heck would they list something on the menu as being vegan when in fact the entire dish is not at all vegan. It makes no sense. I tried to explain this to the waitress but they don't get it. I wonder  how many vegans ate the vegan dish and didn't realize it's not completely vegan. The waitress took my salad and didn't bring me back another salad without the sauce. I had to ask. Lack of common sense. In general the food is okay and the waitresses are nice. The portions are kind of small in general. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Love that it is inherently gluten free! It was so good I went back the next day. First night got the guasacana... amazing. The cold avocado in the piping hot arepa was perfect. The next evening I got the legumbres, also superb. Next time I'm in Montreal this will be one of my first stops!"}
{"text":"Yummiest arepas! I would highly recommend the plantain & cheese appetizer! Simple, yet delicious! The Reina pepiada arepa is my favourite! Really friendly and fast service and a very welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Arepera has amazing varieties of arepas; from pulled pork, braised beef and fish to great vegetarian and vegan options. They also make an effort to inform everyone that they use exclusively grain-fed chicken from Voilaillees et Bibiers Fernando a butcher shop right around the corner. It's refreshing to know that there now is an option where meat eaters, vegetarians, gluten sensitive, and... vegans... can eat under the same roof and that roof not having to be a park chalet and the meal being a potluck."}
{"text":"This vénézuélien arepery served me one of the best meals of my life. I never thought a muffinwhich had this much potential. I was able to savor all of the well-balanced flavors without the arepa falling apart or the ingredients becoming soggy or cold. Every bite was as good as the first. The sauces and toppings were fresh and plentiful. The cheese was sharply salty next to the mild but delicious avocado cilantro sauce. Nothing was under or over salted -even the arepa dough was perfect. The quantity of food left me blissfully satisfied. Servers were also really nice and gave tips."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant as it was highly rated. I'm happy to say that we were not disappointed in any way. 
The venue itself is small and quaint. The decor is unpretentious but very colourful as one might expect for a South American themed restaurant.  Nothing about the place feels contrived in anyway, in fact the first impression that we got was that we were in for an authentic Venezuelan culinary experience, especially after the wonderful all pervading aroma from the kitchen wafted into our noses. Our party of two, arrived for an early dinner and had no problems getting seated at this popular venue,  although I could imagine people having to queue down the street as the evening got on as it was quite full by the time we left. 
Arepas are of course their specialty.  These 100% gluten free homemade corn tortilla sandwiches look small but they are actually extremely filling. They come with a small side salad. I'm a big guy and I certainly would not need to order more then one. 
We shared the #2 (beef, beans, plantain, feta cheese) and #10 (chicken, avocado, feta). They were both excellent!!! I couldn't decide which was better.
We also ordered the house made yuca chips as a starter. These are like potato chips but much lighter. They're served with a guacamole dip which was actually perfect.  The same dip is also provided with the arepas along with another spicy one which neither of us really cared for as the heat was too overpowering. 
The service was very friendly and efficient. 
As we devoured our sandwiches, a Venezuelan guitar player started to serenade the patrons with his renditions of various LatinAmerican classics. His easy smile and good humour was extremely contagious and before long everyone including the staff was taking part in the fun. 
At one point we stepped outside for some fresh air and we had the pleasure of meeting the owner/head chef Max who was taking a break. 
It was nice to get to know the man behind the restaurant. He related how he and his family arrived to Montreal and how he appreciated the multi cultural aspect of  the city and openness of its people.  He explained how above all his goal in opening the restaurant was to share with others his own cultural identity the best way he knows how, by cooking up fresh and authentic meals from his home country. 
Based on our experience I would say he exceeded his goals. We are very much looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I had the arepa with black beans, plantains and cheese, delicious and very affordable. A friend and I went here and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table as it was a busy Saturday night but definitely worth the wait and they also have take away options"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tasty! I really love this place... The service is great, they're super friendly :) 
I always order \"Pabellon/beef\" it's really good"}
{"text":"My venezuelan friends are the ones that took me here to try some typical venezuelan food. I loved how something so simple was so flavorful and also filling. The place is really small and tends to be packed, if you sit around for too long during peak times, you will be asked to leave (sometimes not in a very nice manner)."}
{"text":"The arepas here were fantastic! We were lucky enough to arrive right before the dinner crowd and got a table in this cozy, colorful place. It is truly a hidden gem--tucked away on a side street in a residential neighborhood. The food was absolutely delicious and they offered tasty juices and drink options."}
{"text":"Eating arepas is a messy delight. I frequently had smears of the green and red sauces they offered along with our meal spread across my face. I had napkins. I could deal. 

I ordered the black bean and plantain arepa and loved it. The service was attentive, and the restaurant was small but festive. It looked like you could order and eat out front, which would be an excellent way to enjoy the meal.

There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. A place for anyone to be happy, unless they don't enjoy a little sauciness."}
{"text":"Place to not too hard to find, its an OK place, great customer service, Food wise not a great fan, I had tried similar ones in other places, lack authenticity..pretty blan..

After trying few recommended drinks, only good one is LULU.....desert are ok, 

Food is not expensive its varies from 8-14bucks

Its a good place to go with a group, not always busy from my experience based on a friday night...Not something I will try again."}
{"text":"You know you've found a good arepa restaurant when the owner greets his regulars in Spanish. He is Venezuelan, and really knew what he was doing food-wise. The menu itself had us salivating. I ordered the guasacaca arepa (avocados, onions, tomatoes, lemon, coriander) and it came loaded with avocados! It also comes with a watercress salad, which I don't think the menu mentions. Food comes with two hot sauces, a milder avocado-based one and a spicier one that I couldn't handle. I ended up smothering my already avocado-ladened arepa in avocado sauce and then used it as salad dressing. The sauce is that good! I also ordered the side of platanos, which comes with six nicely sized slices fried to perfection and some white cheese that I didn't eat because I'm lactose intolerant. My friends all enjoyed their foods as well, and one even ordered a second serving of his arepa. We left feeling extremely full and satisfied.

The restaurant itself is brightly decorated, and I loved the cozy, relaxed ambience. Service is a little bit slow, but that just gives you more time to take in the different colors, wall decorations, etc. I would definitely come back, if only for the avocado sauce."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already in a 5 month interval. Very glad to see that the quality has not fallen at all. It has fantastic quality price (I would say even cheap). 

Arepa Pabellón is my favorite although Plato Reina is also excellent. 

I truly haven't found anything to take a star away. Service is also fast and pleasant. The manager takes great care. Highly recomended! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Set to a charming soundtrack of Latin version remixes of popular artists mixed in with Latin music, we were greeted by a super-pleasant and friendly server. My friend and I couldn't help but notice how much fun it seemed like everyone working in this restaurant was having.  

I loved the little touches like the board with the 'word of the week' in English, French and Spanish, and the kitschy, brightly colored fun decor.  I also loved the piles of fresh ingredients by the counters - plantains, avocados, cassava. Very cool. 

The menu is pretty complete - for those that are unaware, an arepa is a gluten-free cornbread sandwich. The menu is laid out with meat, vegetarian and vegan options all clearly marked.  Prices are very reasonable, and the selection of options is great. They had, when I was there, 4 kinds of fresh juices, one of which I recognized (mango). I opted for lulu, a kind of colombian fruit I had never heard of and had a shark and plantain arepa. We also shared the cassava chips.  The arepas come with avocado sauce (yum!) and hot sauce (yes, it is hot), as well as a small watercress salad. 

For two arepas, cassava chips and a juice, the total was $24 after tax but pre-tip. 

I will say that although our service was excellent, and the owner offered us a free dessert (I have no idea what it was but it was tasty!) for no particular reason, I did notice a customer that came after us waiting quite a long time without attention. I'm guessing service here is a bit hit or miss."}
{"text":"Colorful little restaurant. The service was good and the food was equally amazing. Loved the shark sandwich. Good vegetarian options. But I guess the standout for me was the hot sauce. Definitely would love to come by another time."}
{"text":"I ate here last night while on vacation in Montreal. I had the pork arepera with avocado. It was amazing and delicious!! I also tried the plantains and they were yummy as well. This is an excellent casual restaurant."}
{"text":"AwWas recommended from a local student when I came in from Toronto and this was amazing! Every detail in the food is authentic, the men that prepare the food are true lovers of what they do. 
The best I've had up to this point in places like Kensington Market and New York aren't quite like what this place did. Arepas are quite difficult to make soft enough to bite into easily but hard enough to contain all the (expertly) prepared ingredients. The chorizo was delicious, their green sauce is crazy and their hot sauce has kick! Plantains, avocados and queso andino are a great combination as is but I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic gluten free options! Great service"}
{"text":"Good varieties , v friendly service.. Music takes you to south america. All at decent prices!
I like specially their tropical juices :)

Arepa sandwiches are loaded to the Max! A delicious lunch or dinner in generous portions."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this little place.  The best part about Arepera is that everything is gluten-free and there are lots of vegetarian and vegan options, which makes this a great place to converge with friends of all dietary stripes.  The yuca chips and salsa are incredibly tasty.  The sandwiches are a total treat - the arepas are perfect - hot, fresh corn buns.  The meats and fillings are all delicious, and the home-made sauces are fantastic.

My only complaint is that they've majorly toned down the spice of the spicy sauce since they first opened up.  I really wish they'd bring back their original recipe."}
{"text":"Best showcase of Venezuelan arepas in the city. Price is right, lots of choices, great service. This people really thought it through. They serve a very good product overall. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have no idea if this is authentic but I can say that it's delicious and the staff are wonderful. We've done takeout a few times which is particularly wise on weekends when the place is jumping.  One of the best \"bang for the buck\" places in the plateau."}
{"text":"Disregard all of the reviews about the food being subpar. I thought it was amazing. It did take a while, but it was very worth it when it did arrive. The service lacked a bit, but where the speed fell short the friendliness of the staff more than compensated for the wait.  The food was very flavorful and the atmosphere was very welcoming. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great time! Hard to get a table. 

Atmosphere was awesome!  You wait outside foe your name to be called. We sat on a bench waiting for our name. The wait was worth it. The choices of meals was what I expected. 

I had the chorizo plate and a side of chips with avocado sauce.  The plate came with rice and beans, fried plantains, and peppers and onions mixed with the chorizo. A side of feta cheese could be placed on the beans for taste.  A piece of flat bread came with the meal.  You could taste each ingredient. 

I made the misstep of putting my cheese on the chorizo. The feta would have yielded to the other ingredients better if I mixed it and melted it in with the beans.

We opted for jugo de mango (mango juice).  It tasted fresh prepared.

While some restaurants want to provide you with new food combinations in an effort to peak your interest, this place manages to provide you with better than your mother makes favorites.  You don't have to question the food pairings at this place."}
{"text":"Ok, after being berate by friends by my previously low review I forced myself to give Arepera another try. 

Service was fast (the previous servers being notably absent - hopefully this is a permanent change), and the food was good, and all arrived quickly. I guess I would probably go back. 

For now I'll give it a 3/5 (would have given it 4/5 based on THIS experience alone, but because of the last few times here, which were a 1/5,  I'm going average it out to a 3/5)."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce petit resto un jour de pluie. Je ne sais pas si c'est le décor, les épices ou les jus de fruits frais mais je me suis sentie réellement ailleurs !
Pour ma part, j'ai aimé."}
{"text":"This is a must-go to place in Montreal if you are looking for an inexpensive but excellent meal!!! Everything tastes fresh and delicious. If you live in NY, it is just as amazing as caracas."}
{"text":"We were told to check this place out next time we came to Montreal and we did. It was awesome and the food was great all around! I had the pernil plate and my friends had arepas. I would def go back again!"}
{"text":"My twin an I recently discovered Arepera, a traditional venezulien treasure of duluth!

Food is so tasty and fresh that we had to go again only few days later to get our favorite, el Pabellon (their specialty) aka 100% corn hand made bread, feta, black beans, plantain and delicious pulled beef. What adds to the deliciousness of the meal is their homemade avocado based sauce and spicy sauce muy piquante. Make sure to add those on your parebas, your taste buds will go straight to nirvana, no joke.

Place is simple and charming with a ever smiling and inviting staff. The owner is also there to welcome you with kindness and pride of his family business. He even wanted to see our expressions while having our first bite of his coconut flanc, one of absolute delight! 

Also you really get it for your money,  big sandwiches with little salads for only 9,00$ (even cheaper for the vegeterians ones) We went on the evening and at noon, place is usually full at peak hours. Happily, there is a little waiting list on the outside, and you wont wait more then 20 min. 
So if you want to bite into a real venezulien culinary experience go to arepera! 

note: all breads are gluten free"}
{"text":"\"Feels like I flew in to Caracas!!! Best Arepas outside of Venezuela. Small lil hole in the wall restaurant but the taste of a Michelin Star. \""}
{"text":"I was happy to find Arepera, a welcome change from the places we would ordinarily go for lunch. It had been several years since I had arepas, and those were made by a friend who has since moved away. So I was thrilled to be able to have them again, and this place does not disappoint. The arepas were awesome as was the staff and service. Three in our party were vegetarians/vegans and they thoroughly enjoyed their lunch. The owner was kind enough to entertain the kids out in front of the restaurant after we were done eating. If you're in Montreal and like arepas you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Long due review... we went there in the summer... visiting from NYC with my parents... as Venezuelans we were surprise to find this authentic Venezuelan food in Montreal... went twice in a week for lunch... tried a bunch of the arepas and they were great.. prices are reasonable .. and the service is the best.. we had the chance to sit down with the owner a couple of times before the restaurant got busy.. in regard of the food, if you are not familiar with Venezuelan food as for the owner and he will give you all the details . Great place!"}
{"text":"You really HAVE to go! It is rare that I hit a place and it really floors me. Arepera du Plateau did tonight! It is small, so plan accordingly. I had a table for two immediately at 7pm on a Thursday, but there was only one table left. It turns pretty quickly, though. 
Service was just fine, especially considering one waitress works all the tables. She spoke English, French and Spanish as was very nice and efficient. 
They serve an avocado-based sauce (Salsa Guasacaca) with everything, and it is just smashing! I'd eat a rock covered with this stuff. The point is you don't have to order something with avocado in it to enjoy the sauce. And they serve a very hot (to my gringo tongue) sauce on the side as well. 
The arepas they serve are gluten-free, made with corn. I had Reina Pepiada ($9ca), shredded chicken and avocado ( I love avocado), based on  a Yelp review. And I kept squirting on more guasacaca. Heavenly. I kept thinking I'd eat another but I also had a Jugo de parchita (passion fruit juice, $3 ca) that was just wonderful. Not too sweet. And for dessert the gateau de chocolate. Small but really intense cake drowned in a hot dark chocolate sauce ($3.50 ca)I was plenty full. 
I had never encountered Venezuelan cuisine before, so it was a delightful adventure. My meal with taxes, 20% tip came to $21.73 CA, or $16.04 US."}
{"text":"Wow talk about a heavy sandwich. And I mean quite literally, this sandwich weighs a lot for the size.

I got the Catira sandwich which is essentially pulled chicken in tomato sauce and cheddar cheese. It was freaking delicious. My friend got something with beef, can't remember, but he also loved it. Going back to my first sentence, this sandwich is heavy; both, as in it will fill you up AND it's got some weight on it. 

They serve the sandwiches with two kinds of sauce: one lime-ish sour one and one super duper spicy one. I loved the sour one but my friend was crazy about the spicy one so I'm gonna vouch for both. 

Keep in mind it's a mid-price sandwich. For the two sandwiches, it was around $22 including tax and tip."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ce restau, une trouvaille Yelp! dans mon voisinage, alors que j'étais a la recherche d'un coin végétarien pour une connaissance. Ils ont une section menu du tonnerre pour les végétariens, en plus de servir une viande excellente. Il y règne une amiance gentil-chaos qui n'a d'égal que la grande qualité de la nouriture.

J'aurais aimé inscrire \"as good as it gets\" comme critique, mais au delà de tout le positif, je ne suis pas sûr, quand je vois le menu rédigé en premier en espagnol avec des sous-titres plus petits en français, ou quand le serveur (ils sont évidemment très pressés dans cet endroit exigu, mais quand même) saluer les gens en premier en espagnol. Malgré tout ils parlent très bien en français et sur un ton très cordial. J'espère qu'ils vont changer leur menu, et le rédiger pour qu'il apparaisse d'abord en français puis en espagnol.

Et pour ceux qui recherchent des arepas à Montréal, ceux-ci sont excellents!

Sans gluten!"}
{"text":"First timer with my wife...date night looking for a new experience. There was a line outside the door and the very friendly owner said 15 minutes and we were inside in about 5. Reviews were bang on and we took the recommended Yucan chips (hot and awesome) with the avocado sauce. Wife wanted a salad which was fresh greens/watercress/cilantro/tomatoes/onions... Excellent compliment to the guilt inducing chips. My Arepera sandwhich was shredded chicken breast with avocado sauce and my wife had the sardine Arepera. Both fresh/hot and extremely tasty with the 2 bottles put on the table of more avocado sauce and a very hot but tasty hot sauce. They also came with a small salad, same as we had as an appetizer. No regrets but next time will have a different 2nd appetizer. Very friendly and professional service throughout. The Columbia/Brazil soccer game was on the radio and the table next to us were very excited Columbian fans, who apologized for their energy. When we told them no reason to, we made new friends and got insight into the tournament. We will definitely return. Price was fair and in addition to a type of food we don't make at home it felt like a Latin American vacation right in the heart of Montreal."}
{"text":"We were looking for gluten free restaurants and this one came up on Trip Advisor as rated number 2 in the area so my family and I decided we would give it a try. I am so happy that we did . Every single thing was beyond delicious . We went two nights in a row because we wanted to try other dishes on
The menu.You can get the same dish as an entree or as a sandwich . We had pernil one night and the avocado chicken which I HIGHLY recommend with empanadas the next night . They give you avocado sauce to put on your food which is so flavorful you can't stop eating it . For dessert we had the gluten free chocolate lava cake which was delicious . I highly recommend it and would  definitely go back it is top quality Venezuelan food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The arepas are the best in the city.  They have tons of different options, and everything I've tried has been delicious.  Black bean soup may sound boring to some, but they make it really nicely as well.  The service is friendly and quick, and the decor colorful and warm.  When you are there, try the aquas frescas (tropical juices).

Unfortunately, they do not have a liquor license and it is not byob.  It is pretty small so there may be a wait but generally things move quickly."}
{"text":"Vraiment excellent et tout est sans gluten à petit prix !!;-) je recommande vraiment ce Resto dans un espace certe petit mais cosy !!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure at first when my wife suggested it, because I thought it couldn't be as \"authentic\" as advertised. But boy oh boy was I ever wrong! The food was amazing, the fresh juice bar was amazing, and the ambiance was awesome. We sampled both the Vegan and meat plates which fully satisfied our hunger and left us wanting more, not because there wasn't plenty of food, but because it was just so delicious! Classic Latin music plays from a single speaker above the bar setting the perfect mood. Service is quick, home made sauces are magic on your tongue, and the price tag is cheap. If you're in Montreal you have to go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Tasty, fun, cheap and filling! I loved the different fruit drinks available and the delicious sauces."}
{"text":"Have to say that the $$ rating is too high, it's more of a $ place with arepas for around $7. The food is great- love the domino con platano! There are plenty of things for vegans/vegetarians, as well as meat options. They also have lovely juices, including flavors you don't normally see around Montreal, like tamarind."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Definitely a place I would go to regularly if I lived in Montreal.  Go early as it fills up quickly.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot. Not to mention the man who plays the guitar makes this place that much better. It is a tiny location, so it can be very tight. But this is easily made up for by how amazing the arepas are, and how lively it can be inside. Every time i come to Montreal I make sure I stop here. 
5/5!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Their chicken avocado was delicious."}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint. Menu was extensive. Waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Food was fresh and cooked to order. Highly recommended this place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"So delicious and reasonably priced!! Seems super legit. I'm a vegetarian, and the plate with avocado, beans, rice, cheese and an arepa was great. Would definitely make this a regular spot if I lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the pabellon, ham and cheese arepa, side dish of plantains and mango juice and everything was amazing. Great flavors and reasonably priced. Service couldn't have been warmer. Will definitely be back next time on next visit in town."}
{"text":"My mother and I were in Montreal for the first time, and after a long drive from Connecticut we were looking for a place to grab dinner.  We were blown away by the food at Arepera du Plateau.  The flavors were fresh and delicious.  Our server was funny and made great suggestions.  He was also very helpful, as we had never had areperas before.  I would recommend this place highly, and have been craving another arepera since we left!"}
{"text":"We tried going to scwartz's deli and the line was too long, so we came here instead.  I am so glad because it was one of our best meals.  Juices were delicious, as were the appetizers and areperas.  We loved the black bean soup, fried plantains, and queso.  Kids and adults were happy."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that make Montreal a food heaven.

THE FOOD
Primarily arepas, but executed to perfection. The 4 we tried were excellent, but the mushroom one was sublime.

THE SERVICE
With a smile and lots of grace, inspite of the busy pace.

THE ATMOSPHERE
Small and hip without pretences."}
{"text":"Food wasn't exactly exceptional, but it was still pretty delicious. The best part was the atmosphere and the mango juice! It was super fresh and tasty!!"}
{"text":"As a Venezuelan, this place does remind me of home growing up with arepas. I would say this place was between a 3.5 to 4.  We ordered the following dishes. 
Chicharron with rice and bean - pork skin was not very crunchy but it was okay
Pernil with rice and bean - pork was sliced a bit dry
Chuleta with rice and bean - this tasted more like a ham flavoring
Empanadas de carne - good but small portion 
Cassava Frita (fried yuca) with guasacaca sauce - nice but very small . Only came with 5 pieces. 
The rice was fluffy, black bean was good, and arepa was yummy.  We also ordered the guanabana and mango juice both was really good."}
{"text":"I never review places but I HAD TO REVIEW THIS PLACE...!!!!!  1st time visiting Montreal from NYC with my family and this place is AMAZING!!! Loved the food, loves the atmosphere, and the owner Max is an AWESOME guy.   His hospitality, warmth, and charisma is priceless..!! Highly recommended, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. It was my first time eating an Arepera, so I don't have much to compare it to. However, the food was flavourful, portion to price ratio, and service were all good. They take reservations so make sure you call ahead. The main dishes are about $9-$15 each and each side or appetizer you get is about $5 extra. I ended up getting the open face Arepera plate and the yuca fires. I really liked both. They also serve a gluten free beer and offer a lot of gluten free options. The only down fall to this place is the parking. There's no private parking and hardly street parking during dinner time"}
{"text":"Want to love this place but the Arepas are soooo bland!  Also takes so long to get your sandwich. Maybe I was spoiled with ones Ive tried in NYC but these were very disappointing. Unfortunately I dont think there is a better place in town for Arepas.."}
{"text":"Waooooo, I hit the. lotto whit this place . A truly place tha make feel you are travel  for the time you are eating. Excellent food and agrest prices for your. money."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! This place is fantastic. We ordered the brunch and a sandwich. Both of which had a beautiful array of flavours. Hella recommend this spot"}
{"text":"The Arepera was a gem tucked into a corner spot in Plateau Mont-Royal and was a resounding success! After living in a proverbial desert of Latin food in RI, our trip to Montreal offered the sabor we had been missing for so long. 

The wait was about 20 min on a Sunday afternoon, not too bad since the weather was comfortable. The wait list is a dry erase board next to the door. It's not easily noticeable and some folks seemed to miss it at first. 

Talk about amazing food choices. While I love arepa sandwiches, my wife and I both settled for the Plato de pabellón; her choice was the stewed chicken and mine was the roasted pork. The platters are a phenomenal portion given the price, plenty of food but not overkill. The pork was outstanding and the arepa was, hands down, the best arepa I ever had. Definitely recommend the side of Venezuelan guacamole to go with. And the sauces! One chile-based spicy, one avocado-based mild... Both amazing!! Go there!!"}
{"text":"YUM! What a great find. We came here on the recommendation of some trustworthy internet friends and it did not disappoint. My chicharon arepa was filled with super crunchy pork, and the unique texture of the arepa was awesome. The chorizo in A's arepa could have been cut a little smaller but was still tasty. I loved both the spicy sauce and the creamy cilantro sauce on mine. We shared a plate of plantains for an appetizer, A got a beer (they only carry a gluten-free brand), and I tried the lulo juice, which was interesting and sort of citrusy-sweet.

We were seated right away. The place was bustling but not crowded on a Saturday at 7. It was filled with couples, families, and folks getting takeout. Our food took a bit longer to come than I would've liked (and a couple who got their order taken at the same time as we did got their arepas much sooner) but the servers were friendly and we really enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Amazing place to introduce one to the plateau! This was my first taste of it and it was incredible. The arepas are so tiny but so dense and filling. We even had a live musician singing and playing the guitar as he walked around the tiny restaurant, smiling at patrons and making us clap along with him. 

I had the pabellon arepa and the plantains, beef, beans, everything, was cooked perfectly. The side salad was original and yummy and the avacado sauce can't be beat. The service was quick and the place is colorful and tastefully decorated even though it is tiny.

Thank you, Arepera du Plateau! I had a wonderful evening and you were a huge part of it."}
{"text":"The arepas were so delicious!  Love the avocado and hot sauce!  The drinks were also excellent - we had passionfruit and sugar cane + lime.  The service was slow - there seemed to be some issue with prepping and serving that needed to be worked out.  Their restaurant definitely has potential if they work out some of the issues with serving/preparing.  I had the #1 - it was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Really cool little vénézuélien place. Authentic \"Areperas\" which are sort of sandwich like and delicious. Interesting sauces to add to your sandwich too - avocado and a hot sauce.
The juices and Postabon soda are great! Black bean soup is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very good arepa place!  Great options for vegetarians, the arepas and plate options are really tasty. Service is friendly and attentive. The areas are a good size, one can feel you up and they are served with a little salad. The decor is very fun and warm."}
{"text":"Arepas are excellent, best place in town so far. The papelón con limón was perfect.

Service was good but a bit slow 

The Quesillo was Ok"}
{"text":"I've been 3+ times. VERY GOOD. One time they totally forgot our order until we brought it up 45 minutes later (we had to take it to go as we had to be somewhere, but they gave it to us for free), granted I think the waiter was new. Usually the service is good. Options for everyone here (from vegan to carnivore), and I love the atmosphere. I will be back! AND ITS SO AFFORDABLE. Yum."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Delicious. Fast. Friendly.  Delicious. And all GLUTEN FREE! We got the black bean and feta sandwich and empanadas.   Amazing! Yummy yummy guac sauce. My only regret is we didn't go back before we left Montreal. I will crave it until I get back here.  Did I mention it was delicious?!"}
{"text":"I saw so many good reviews about this place, so we decided to try it out. Unfortunately we were disappointed.. the sandwich is small and only meat and some sauce in it. Nothing special, just normal food. Kinda expensive. The entrees were good but also small and pricy. For two people it adds up to 40$ if u wanna have a drink too. You can go to a byow for 20$ each max. and bring your bottle. The place is nicely decorated and inviting, but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Huge selection of arepas to choose from. Give the chorizo de jabali or shark a try. So good! Where they really get you is the sauce. Load up your arepa with green avocado sauce  the lather on some red spicy sauce. DO IT EVERY BITE. The house juices are fresh squeezed and delicious. If I lived on this side of town I would be in here every week. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great food, the entres a bit expesive for the portion, however very good. I thought the yuka was super good better than the empanadas. Their salsa sauce is exquisite !! The only problem we had was that the sa dwiches came with a tiny tiny salad and there was nothing in them unless u asked. It was a great venezuelan experience, but i would not go back."}
{"text":"This place has delicious arepas! Everything is very fresh and a good value for the cost. Also the avocado sauce is boss."}
{"text":"If you want to try a different, and very delicious authentic Spanish food, this truly a superb spot!
Arepas are not a common and easy to find place to eat them throughout Montreal. Look no more, this is the place to try them and enjoy them.
They have a wide variety for all palettes, including for those that are vegetarians. Arepas are also glunten-free.

Their arepeas are done to perfection! Tender, soft, warm and full of flavour depending what the filling you decide to try. I would suggest either the pulled pork or chicken.
You may think $7.00-$9.00 for one arepa could be pricey. Not at all. Arepas in general are quite filling since it's mainly made with white corn flour, always by hand. Hence why these arepas are perfectly done! Along with a generous filling of your choice.
Do remember to ask for their guacamole sauce, it's fantastic!! Or if you like a little zing, they do bring you a sauce with a kick.

As the restaurant is quite small, go early or go late in the day.  Their service was friendly and outstanding, our food arrived within ten minutes after ordering, while the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"Petit endroit qui de l'extérieur, n'a l'air de rien, mais qui charmera vos papilles dès la première bouchée !

Arepa c'est le mot pour sandwich Venezuelien. Vous n'en avez jamais mangé? moi non plus, du moins avant cette visite. Ils sont constitués de pain de maîs (assez copieux, et mous a l'intérieur) et fourrés a la viande ou au poisson  (plusieurs choix végé également) a votre goût. Plusieurs jus frais de fruits tropicaux pour accompagner le tout. Les prix varient entre 7 et 13$ environ pour un sandwich avec une petite salade, mais vous pouvez choisir d'autres accompagnements.

A essayer !"}
{"text":"Je vais revenir ici c'est certain. Une amie m'a fait découvrir et j'ai été charmée et complètement bourré. Peu couteux et surtout délicieux. À essayer!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's affordable, gluten free and offers so many options on their menu. You can get arepas with chicken, beef, pork, avocado, shrimp, the options are endless. They include a small salad with your arepa as well which is nice. It is super busy around 6-8pm so expect a bit of a wait. Service was questionable, they weren't super attentive so you do have to wave down your waitresses and waiters."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Gluten free, delicious, and speedy. I've never had Venezuelan food before, and immediately after leaving had to locate a restaurant in my own city. We trekked across town to come and it was so worth it!!"}
{"text":"We came here because of the kick-ass reviews but were really really disappointed. First, let me list the good:
1. Service was fast
2. The restaurant was very clean
3. It was packed (which is a good sign usually)
4. Decent prices

Now the bad:

We were 4 people who made it a point to try as many different things as possible to get a broad sense of the menu. Overall we ordered the plantains, empanadas, and yuca sticks as appetizers - the plantains and yuca sticks were flavorless which was sad because we've had amazing yuca sticks and plantains at other restaurants. For our mains, we ordered 4 different  sandwiches: chicken avocado because we were told it was a best seller, beef avocado, chicken plantain bean, and one more I can't remember. They ALL fell flat. Everyone at our table was disappointed - the food looked amazing but it stopped there. Also, it was really hard to sit there when it was close to 30C outside because there's no air conditioning. It's not really conducive to a good dinner atmosphere when everyone is sweating bullets and counting down the minutes to leaving. We even had one member of our group step out early to go sit in his air conditioned car because it was that hot....

We sadly won't be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from US,we wanted to avoid the touristy choices for lunch offered in old Montreal.  Good decision.  Found this place after a quickie Yelp search.  Arrived in a teaming rainstorm and pleasantly surprised by a filled restaurant.  Decor is modern with great wall art.
Owner sat us and made sure to give us an orientation to menu.  We decided on two different arepas, pork/avocado and fish/plantain.  Also salad and guava juice.
Each item was incredibly fresh, nicely seasoned and with a generous portion.  All were delicious.
Having traveled in Venezuela and got to eat arepas on many occasions, to find such an authentic place in Montreal was a special event."}
{"text":"I was skeptical that a Venezuelan restaurant in Quebec could be authentic, but I ran into the owner while strolling down Duluth one night and discovered that he'd come to Montreal for school and stayed. He talked me into coming there to eat the next night and I'm glad I did.

I'm a vegetarian and South American food is not generally vegetarian friendly, but Arepera du Plateau is an exception. There were at least ten vegetarian arepas, plus at least one vegetarian entry. On the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the arepas filled with garlic mushrooms. They were excellent. The arepa was crisp and tasty, and the mushrooms succulent. I also had plantains and a fruit juice made from a Colombian fruit, lulu, recommended by my waitress. The plaintains were what I expected but the juice was a pleasant surprise. 

So far this is the best meal I've had in my four days in Montreal."}
{"text":"I love Venezuelan food and this place did not disappoint me!  The arepas are absolutely delicious and there are many vegetarian options.  The sauces which come with the dishes are also delicious.  The sweet plantains are soooo good!  I cannot get enough of this amazing food!  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Petit resto Vénézuélien, avec un décor correct.  On est un peu tassé les uns sur les autres et le proprio joue à la chaise musicale pour essayer d'accommoder le plus de personnes possibles.  À la longue ça devenait fatiguant car tu peux difficilement manger en paix.
La qualité du menu laisse à désirer, c'est comme si la gastronomie vénézuélienne se résumait aux arepas et au Pabellon Criollo... 
D'ailleurs leur Pabellon Criollo (qui est le plat TYPIQUE DU VÉNÉZUELA) est raté sur toute la ligne!  Les bines noires sont incontestablement des bines en canne, mais là n'est pas leur seul pêché, la viande haché qui est servie avec le pabellon est trop collante et même le riz n'avait  pas goût... Une déception totale. La portion de plantain servie avec ce plat est trop petite. Les arepas m'ont semblé trop salés et dures.  La Yuca y la Guasacaca en entrée.... une autre déception...
Je n'y retournerais pas.  Cela ne vaut pas la peine.  
Nous sommes LOIN, mais vraiment à des années lumières de la nourriture vénézuélienne."}
{"text":"The arepas are yummy and under $10, which is already a win in my book. The atmosphere is cozy, fun and homey and our waitress was a real gem, extremely friendly and helpful. The piles of avocados, plantains, cassavas and other produce in front of the counter were very charming. Don't forget to get an order of plantains!

My friend and I sampled a #1 which was a stewed beef/black been/plantain arepa, which was reeeeally good, but probably the heaviest of the three arepas that we ended up gorging on. We also had a #6 (sorry, I can't remember the names) which was like a creamy chicken salad with avocado. It was good, but not fantastic. The best one, however, was the chicken chorizo arepa that we ordered as our round 2. 

Our meal was served with a hot sauce and an avocado sauce, both which were very tasty.

My only gripes... and I reaaaaally hate to even bring these up because I like them and I want them to do well... is that there is one older fellow there who had dirty fingernails, came out of the bathroom zipping up his fly, and kept us waiting at the cash register while he tinkered with the restaurant's iPod. I wish I didn't have to write this, but I can't get it out of my mind. Thankfully, I did not see him involved in any food prep so... maybe I can forgive it. I think? I guess?

Regardless, I will probably be back because I liked the food and it was super affordable and the staff is extremely friendly!

Oh and by the way. The tres leches dessert is TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Went to the new place on Easter Sunday, the food still amazing and now even more spacious. Excellent Venezuelan food!"}
{"text":"All the menu is great, sometimes I explore different items in the menu and I always have a nice tasty surprise. I highly recommend the plantain and cheese dessert, after the perfect arepa."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food!! So happy to have found a vegan AND gluten free friendly restaurant ! I can't wait to go back for more of the avocado sauce!! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my mom, and we both loved it.

We both had the arepas.  I had the shredded beef with plantains, black beans and feta arepa ($9) and she had the shredded chicken in tomato sauce arepa ($8).  They both came with a tiny watercress side salad.

The arepas were stuffed full.  Mine had too little beef for my liking, but the beef it did have was tender and flavourful.  The plantains were sweet and went well with the nippy feta.  The black beans were nicely done - not too mushy nor too hard.  All the ingredients blended together well in the sandwich.  They did bring some hot sauce and avocado sauce to the table, but I felt that the sandwich didn't need any additional sauces.  The arepa itself was nice and fluffy on the inside and a bit harder on the outside, just the way I like it.  It's like an English Muffin but made of corn instead of wheat.  The watercress salad had some of the avocado sauce on it.  It was tasty, but pretty simple.  I mean, it was just watercress after all (no other vegetables).

My mom enjoyed her arepa but felt that it was too wet.  She said by the end, the bottom of her sandwich was all soggy.  She also felt it was a bit boring with just the shredded chicken.  She said she regretted not ordering one of the pork ones.

The place is really small, with just over 20 seats or so.  We arrived a little before noon and the doors were still locked.  They unlocked right at noon (their opening time) and we and 2 other customers entered.  By 12:30pm, the place was packed.  It was a weekday. 

Service was friendly and efficient.  The place is super cute.  It gets a bit loud though.  

I would come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"¡Welcome to Venezuela! I have had arepas in the past and they weren't any better than just simply meh! This place is something completely different! Upon dining at Arepera I discovered that whatever it was that I tried those other times were simply not arepas. ¡¡Arepas, arepas, arepas, my newfound love!! Arepas are soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside, they are sort of in between corn pancakes and corn tortillas; grilled to golden perfection, it is used as the most perfect pillow for your filling of choice to rest it's weary self. This arepa is lulled into a serene slumber -- or more like a slumber party in your mouth. The soft subtle taste and pillowy comfort of the arepa combined with the golden crisp works off and riffs with the avocado, feta and black beans to create a cacophony of flavour that no person can resist. The yuca chips and avocado sauce are an excellent start to your meal. Also, don't miss up the chance to try one or all of their excellent freshly squeezed exotically tropical fruit juices. ¡Welcome to Venezuela!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Service was nice. The building is small, but when I was there there was not really any space issue. The avocado sauce is delightful and definitely a must try. Great food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. Need I say more? Portion sizes are great. It can get busy, so if you want, you can call ahead and order take out. They'll have it ready for you when you get there. My favourite arepas (kind of like sandwiches) are the reina (chicken and avocado) and the bean and plaintain. 

The advantage to eating in is that the restaurant is nice and bright inside and you get a free watercress salad when you eat in."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Montreal recently and saw good reviews for this small restaurant.  We went in and it was packed with people and families enjoying excellent food.  Service was quick and informative and everything was prepared to perfection.  Being from California we are familiar with good Latin American food. Arepera is a great choice for food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Went back last night and had the 36, the shredded chicken in tomato sauce. While the beans and rice were still very tasty and still loved the avocado cream sauce, I noticed the chicken was really dry :( It was edible and had a good flavor, but the dryness really took it down a notch. Not sure if it's just an off day or they always make it like that."}
{"text":"I didn't expect the arepa to be stuffed with so much filling but wow - I couldn't even take a bite from each ends of the arepa. Had to eat some of the filling first haha. definitely add the spicy and cilantro sauce they give you.
You can either get the arepa sandwich w a side Salad or a plate which comes with filling, rice, beans, plantains and an arepa on the side
Also you must get the empanadas. You can get a choice of filling: chicken / beef / or cheese. The breading for this was something else. 
Great service and loads of spots to sit. 
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"A long awaited shout out to these guys. After many, many visits I can safely and authoritatively  give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of the Plateau, on the corner of Duluth and de Bullion. Street parking is available (in limited quantities - don't forget to check the zoning) and the closest subway is probably Mont-Royal [orange]. From there, it's about a 10-minute walk.

The place: Very small but it gets the job done. You'll need to be OK with being cozied up next to your neighbours, though.

The goods: Areperas, obviously. I'd never heard of these things until a friend of mine suggested we grab lunch here. In a nutshell, an arepera is a corn-based bread that is stuffed with meaty (or veggie goodness. It kinda looks like a smaller, fatter version of a pita. With your first bite, you will immediately think to yourself \"Sh*t, I need to order another one of these\" but wait! One's enough - they're fairly large and very filling! I ordered the shredded chicken with avocado sauce. It was so damn good. 'Nuff said. Oh, except you need to get more of that avocado sauce because it is TAYST-EE. Watch out for the red sauce - it'll open up your sinuses in no time. 

Service: Good! We were seated pretty quickly considering the place was full, and the wait staff was friendly. We didn't have to wait very long for our orders either, which is great because I was starting to feel a little hangry.

Price point: $9 for one arepera."}
{"text":"Vegies and feta arepa I got was great. Would I pay again $9 for a no-meat snack (take out)?   I don't think so. The place is not on a busy street and Venezuelan food is simple so should be priced accordingly, imho"}
{"text":"Petit vénézuélien qui ne paie pas de mine mais est vraiment excellent!
Les arepas, petits pains de mais typiques, sont super bons et bien garnis! La bouffe donne vraiment l'impression de \"bouffe maison\", c'est un régal, et pas si cher pour la qualité et la quantité!
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great ambience. With no AC on a hot day, and delicious food, we seemed transported to Venezuela itself! An experience I would highly recommend on a sunny summer day! Felt like vacation!"}
{"text":"LOVE! This place is great and the arepas are pretty fantastic! 
If you haven't had an arepa, check this place out ... if you've had arepas and don't get excited about them, check this place out. Arepera Du Plateau is a small, but not uncomfortable, corner location, with a brightly decorated interior and friendly staff ... no outdoor seating offered (I would love if this changed!). 
As the name suggests, the emphasis is on arepas, which are offered up in a variety of combinations can satisfy omnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike. Arepas can be ordered a la carte with salads and sides or as platers (either way only 1 arepa is needed for most people). 
They don't serve alcohol (I would love if this also changed!) but they do offer a range of fruit drinks which are good ... a little sweet for my taste but good.
While never feeling rushed, the overall experience is all pretty quick (even at peak times). For this reason I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for an \"evening out\" destination ... it's more along the lines of a grabbing something good to eat without all the frills. 
I'm already thinking of the next visit and trying to figure out what's in that green sauce! 
 
TIP: If the tables are full, even if there's a few people in line waiting, wait. The tables turn relatively quickly."}
{"text":"In town visiting? Do yourself a favor and get to this place! So good and so many delicious options!"}
{"text":"We were so overjoyed when we realized arepera du plateau was moving to prince Arthur literally across our apartment. We were huge fans of the original location and to be honest I was a little scared that with this new, way bigger space the quality of the food would drop dramatically just as what happened when AUx Vivres went big a few years ago. We went on opening night and aside the fact that the furniture was arranged very strangely in a way that wastes a huge number of benches to a very strange alley way in the middle that I suppose wants to be reminiscent of a church (when the chairs at the dining tables could be replaced by those benches that no one will ever sit on....) everything was good. The sauces are magnificent, the avocado garlicky and creamy and delicious, the spicy sauce is beautifully fragrant and delicious. The plantains in my sandwich tastes like they had been fried an hour or two before but given that it was their very first night opening in the new locale and there was an insane snow storm out we will give them a free pass for that one time and give them time to get settled in the new space. Long story short Arepera your food is BOOOMB please make sure the quality matches the original location. Love you thanks"}
{"text":"Great food for a small, family-style restaurant. 
We showed up on Saturday around 13h30, and immediately got a table. The ones who came after us were not so lucky, however. A line-up formed, and the \"reservation\" list on the door was soon full. 

The interior was cheerfully decorated with huge paintings of famous musicians (John Lennon, Billie Holiday, etc.) and Venezuela's national colors. Close to the kitchen, baskets full of plantain and avocados gave an impression of plenty. The latino music in the background added to the conviviality of the place. 

We ordered a plate of Reina pepiada (shredded chicken in avocado sauce) with the accompanying black beans, fried plantain and rice, and two arepas (la Margariteña and la Catira). The food came after a bit of waiting, but when it did it was piping hot and looking fabulous. The plantain was sweet and caramelized, the arepa was hot and fresh. The lulo juice I ordered was nice and tangy. We pretty much devoured the food, and soon were more than full (I admittedly overordered). The only leftovers were the watercress salads that came with the arepas. I'm used to eat watercress cooked, so the taste of it raw put me off. 

It was not as cheap as I expected, but definitely satisfying. Next time I will probably skip the platos and go straight to the arepas. By the way, it was my first time tasting shark (la Margariteña) and lulo. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Yummy, authentic Venezuelan restaurant. Tasty food; delightful service. Had the guacamole plate, with black beans and rice; cassava chips with sauce as an appetizer. Delicious sauce; very tasty, chewy handmade masa patty. A savory meal, well worth the trek through the cold, soaking rain..."}
{"text":"The place is over rated, the pabellon is not that great. The rice is dry and the prices are too much for the food I get. I was expecting more... Meh!"}
{"text":"I don't know about authenticity, since I have never had an arepa or Venezuelan cuisine before my recent visit to the Arepera du Plateau, but I am really glad that I checked it out. I never write reviews and I made sure to come write one for this place because it deserves it. 
I went on a Sunday, and the place was packed, with a list on the door to sign your name to wait for a table. I was getting take-out, so this wasn't really my concern. I went up to the counter not sure what to order, but I am a meat-eater and have no allergies so I'm down for anything so long as it is delicious/interesting-tasting. I noted that there was a fresh fruit bar to the left of the take-out counter, with traditional South American fruit flavors (mango, lulo, and some others). 
I asked the man at the counter what he'd recommend, and he said that if I eat meat, the #1, called the Papellon or something similar, is a good call because it's a mix of interesting flavors. It had beef, cheese, black beans, and plantains. The food was good, and the portion huge, and after tax came to about 10 dollars. So all in all a decent price for food in Montreal.
The customer service is the reason I will go back though, besides it being quite close to my apartment in the Plateau. The man at the counter greeted me with a genuine and warm smile and seemed eager to help me pick something that I would like. I waited outside for my takeout with my receipt, and because two people got their food before me, the girl who came outside to bring me my food insisted that I come inside to get a free order of freshly made juice because I waited \"so long.\" I didn't consider it a huge wait, and was really surprised at this gesture on the restaurant's part. When I went inside she made sure I tried every flavor of juice before picking one (I chose lulo because I don't normally have access to that flavor). This type of customer service and the loads of happy guests inside this quaint little restaurant with its adorable decor is what makes my night. I left with a huge smile and the food was great. It was messy to eat while reading, but well worth the short walk and the fair prices. 
I will definitely go again, and will try to sit down the next time I go so my arepa won't be soggy when I eat it (from sitting in the paper while I walk home)."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW! This place was on my list to try for a while and I will definitely be back again and again.

My husband and I came for an early dinner on a Wednesday and were seated right away. It is a popular place so timing is important if you don't want to wait.

He went with the roast pork and cheddar cheese arepera, and I opted for the chicken in tomato sauce platter. The food took a little while but was SO worth it. His arepera was outstanding - the corn shell was warm and crispy and stuffed with lots of meat and melty cheese. My dish was very good as well - I loved the flavour of the meat. The rice and beans were nothing special, but the plantains were to die for! Next time, I will plan to get an arepera and a side of plantains. Both of the sauces were excellent and complimented one another nicely.

We have tried a ton of new restaurants since moving to Montreal and this one tops the list!"}
{"text":"The restaurant we originally were planning to go to closed, so we stumbled upon this little corner Venezuelan restaurant in a pretty neighborhood.  I never had Venezuelan cuisine before and didn't know what I was getting myself into.  Just ordered some plantains as an appetizer.  Can't go wrong with that and they were sweet and done well.  Tried the Jugo de Tamarindo which was like super sweet sludge, I wouldn't try that drink again.  Then we each ordered something called an arepa.  Basically a small corn tortilla opened like a pita and stuffed.  I had shredded chicken in a tomato sauce and I was shocked how delicious and how filling it was.  On the side, a tiny chopped salad with an avocado, lime and cilantro sauce which was nice.  Equally good was the roast pork and avocado salad arepa.  It was a very inexpensive and nice dinner.  Just be warned they don't have air conditioning so on a humid evening, you may want to do take out.  Service was ok, the hostess was very nice but the server was a bit cold.  I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I know- you went by this tiny place and there was a giant group of Spanish and English speakers clogging Rue de Buillon like a tired artery and you thought, oh HELL no.
Stop! Don't go!
It's not as horrible as it looks. Thee hard working Venezuelans are kicking butt in the kitchen and will get you through way faster than you can imagine. We were 4th in line and didn't even have time to go get cafe.
It's a Gluten Free and vegetarian dream. Vegans, you WILL be satisfied. Venezuelan food isn't heavy on cheese, so... 
So bring a crowd of 5 or less, no sweat. Bigger and it will take you longer since they have to wait for multiple tables to leave. Seriously, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great food, super service.

Loved everything about this restaurant.

We ordered 4 arepera's. One chicken, one beef, one pork, and one shark. 
ALL WERE GREAT AND UNIQUE. Our favorite was Le Popular.

The avocado sauce that comes on the side is on point.

The side salad that came with it was exquisite.
The waitress was very nice and helpful. Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"I came on a windy and rainy night and there was a line up outside, but I'm not one to quit, so I made my boyfriend wait outside with the other folks while I sat in my car. I've read really good Yelp reviews and it seems promising, but the dedicated folks on the rain affirmed that this place was in fact worth the wait.

Good: the interior is small and cozy, decorated with large paintings and latin style decor. It's a really small place, so seating can be a bit tight. The menu is extremely affordable, and so we ordered a couple of entrees and dessert. Firstly, the avocado sauces everyone mentions here lives up to the hype. The arepa tastes so darn fresh, and it's also ridiculously filling. I've ordered the feta cheese with grilled vegetables, and loved it for the most party except it had too much cheese (whatever, I've just scraped it off). Even my boyfriend was taken aback by how good the food was. Definitely one of the hidden gems of the Main.

Bad: the dessert wasn't take great, it wasn't bad, but not really worth getting since it just tasted undercooked spongecake and the coconut flan just tasted like vanilla yogurt. Not impressed.

Bottom line: dinner for 2 came out to nearly $30 for an appetizer, 2 mains and 2 desserts. So yeah, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super tasty! The pabellon arepa is AMAZING and completely perfect. Make sure to add a lot of the green sauce - it just adds to the perfection!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service. Followed by delicious food. 

We were left waiting for 50 minutes, watching as people who arrived after us were served their drinks, then their appetizers, then main. All the while, we asked and were told it was on it's way. 

It was a hot day and almost unbearable to sit inside with no AC. So take it to go if it's a hot one.

As for the food. Really delicious. Different to anything I've had before and really enjoyable."}
{"text":"PROS:

1. Food was yummy and portions were very generous! I had an Arepa and it was ginormous! 

2. Great place for a cheap, filling, tasty lunch.

3. The restaurant is colorful, fun and delightful. The juice bar guy was really friendly and had a great sense of humor. 

OVERALL:
-The restaurant was so charming I'd feel bad putting cons! It's a nice place to go for lunch and fresh juice concoctions during the summer."}
{"text":"Yeah im not sure why this place has such a high rating, perhaps our experience was different from others. First of I really liked the fresh juice that they make for you, definitely a bonus! The items on the menu looked good but once we got our food it was not nearly as appetizing. I ordered the plate with crackling and It did not taste right like the grease they used in the fryer was old or something. My wife did not enjoy her sandwich either, the ingredients were subpar, but maybe that was just a bad day for them? Even my wife said it was better before!"}
{"text":"I almost never leave reviews and I especially never leave bad ones but our waitress was incredibly rude. This is more a review of her business ethics than the food because we never got to taste any! We waited 20 minutes to be seated outside in the cold - not a big deal the place is small. She came and took our order and we proceeded to watch table after table that was seated after us receive their food, pay, and leave. 45 minutes went by and the waitress didn't come back to the table once. 

Finally we flagged someone else down because it was impossible to get her attention. We saw the person we spoke with go and speak with our waitress behind the counter and she looked over at us and then pointed at the kitchen. We thought she would come over and explain there had been a mistake and she was sorry. Instead she just continued ignoring us. After 10 more minutes we got up and politely asked what was happening. At this point we had been sitting at a table with nothing but a water carafe for an hour. She said in the rudest voice, \"there was a system error, they are making your food now.\" I told her it was fine, I wasn't mad, we were just going to leave and she started yelling at me that they already started making it and there was a system error. I love arepas and I'm incredibly forgiving of errors - they happen and its happened to me before - but you need to communicate with your customers and you certainly shouldn't be yelling at me for your mistake. It was honestly the rudest and worst experience I've had at a restaurant, and I live in NYC so that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Had cassava Sticks with avocado sauce and an arepa sandwich with shark. While service was a bit slow the wait was worth it. Highly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"My friend brought me there since she's been to Venezuela a dozen times and stayed there with locals. She told me I had to try it out and I'm glad I did!  The areperas are delish!  They're fresh and filling as well. I had the beans & plantain combo and the sweet and salty pairing was amazing, not to mention their oh-so-good avocado/coriander/lime sauce that goes well on literally everything, even on fries! Yummm. The place is cozy and decor gives you the Latin American vibe. Only down side to it is that if the windows are closed you'll end up smelling like you've been sitting in front of a deep fryer because they don't have sufficient ventilation for the kitchen. The fries are a pleasant change from the usual potato fries as they use potatoes normally found in their region. Those also pair well with their amazing sauce btw!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant tucked between Rue St. Laurent and Rue St. Denis. The green sauce is simply fantastic, put it on everything. We got a #1 and a #12, both were fantastic paired with the fried plantains. The people at the restaurant are also super nice and for a traveling American, it was pretty cool to hear French, Spanish, and English all at the same time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but found the food mediocre and overpriced. My friend and I tried two items from the vegan menu (the guacamole and the grilled veg arepas). They cost $8-$8.50 each and we were both underwhelmed and still hungry after eating them. Also, even though we ordered off the vegan menu, the arepas came with tiny side salads that were topped with a mayo dressing. When we explained that we didn't eat mayo they replaced them with two plain salads (just lettuce). I would only return here if the arepas were about half the price, or at least included more substantial sides."}
{"text":"Fast service, vegan options available, extremely tasty Venezuelan cuisine.

Ordered plantains, perfectly seasoned rice and black beans, arepa bread of course, lime heavy chunky guac with tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food served in a brightly colored restaurant that takes you far away from a rainy day in Montreal. Service can be improved on since we didn't get to place our orders for some time, but we didn't care once we tasted the food. Highly recommend the platos, you're definitely going to want to eat more."}
{"text":"I went for take out,getting the pollo guidado platter.It contained black beans,chicken stew,rice,fried plantain and a arepa to stuff.I would say for the price I paid I should get more food.However it good.Ive had better but I will return to try to pork next time."}
{"text":"I stayed around the corner from here while in the city for a month on a yoga/meditation training. As one would imagine, many of my training counterparts were veg. Areperas suited us all. As other reviewers noted, the sauces are not to be missed. My favorite was the hot, however the \"green\" sauce mustn't be discounted by any stretch.

My personal favorite was the boar chorizo arepa, which during my stay was switched to a regular pork chorizo to allow it to be gluten free. The boar had a cerveza marinade in it. Tastes pretty much the same if I'm honest. Others loved the 3 cheese, the shredded chicken with tomato and pork/bean. They also had these massive plates that had rice, plantanos, meat & possibly slices of avocado. Loads of good, savory home style cooking (not that I could come up with this at home), but it tastes like it comes from a home kitchen. 
In summary, go there. Support local."}
{"text":"Loved this little place!! I found it on Yelp and it had great reviews. We walked from the one subway which was kinda long, but on the way back, we took another subway, which was closer. So, if u travel by subway, map it out first. The food was tasty and the entertainment was a quaint old man playing the guitar."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was visiting Montreal and can't tolerate gluten, so I looked around for gluten free restaurants and found this one.  I had never had  Venezuelan food before and so didn't know what to expect.  The food was great, we all really enjoyed our meal.  None of us had the Arepera's, so I can't comment on those, but the platters were quite nice and the juices were good.

The atmosphere is fairly comfortable and informal, and the server was friendly and happy to explain the food choices to us."}
{"text":"This is a cute joint on Duluth street. The Arepas were very unique - the corn bread and the fillings were interesting but I'm not sure how I felt about them as a dish. The dish didn't have a proper salad with it and my drink (the guava juice) was too sweet."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Laid back atmosphere and authentic food. I ordered the pork arepa with an avocado salad. The actual taste of the arepa was amazing, and the only reason I didn't fully enjoy it was my own mistake. I thought that it would have pulled pork, and instead it had more of a thin pork chop. I don't really like pork unless it's a shredded version, but again, that was my fault. My boyfriend got the shredded chicken with avocado sauce and LOVED it. We also got the cassava fries but didn't grab a pic because we were too excited to eat! Haha  Overall, I recommend this place! Great for a cheaper night out and the sandwich is actually very filling!"}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch on a summery Friday and the staff was really nice. We ordered the empanadas appetizer to share (1 cheese, 1 chicken, 1 beef) and each got an arepa. I got the chicken and avocado arepa and my friend ordered a beef, plantain, beans and cheese arepa. 

Everything was really good with the empanadas being my favourite part. I thought the chicken arepa needed something else apart from just chicken and avocado - maybe something crunchy. I added hot sauce to change it up. Super filling and affordable.

Will be going back to try a different flavour combination!"}
{"text":"I came here craving a breakfast I've had at home many times. 

What can I say.. it was on point. Plantains were perfectly salty and sweet, beans were perfectly seasoned, and my arepa was hot and steamy. 

I've also been here a number of times for dinner with friends and family and I cannot recommend this place enough. 

If you're craving authentic Venezuelan fast food, come here."}
{"text":"Best Venezuelans arepas in Montreal, no questions asked. I had the Reina Pepiada which is basically an arepa filled with a creamy mayo avocado shredded chicken, they really nailed it just at the best places in Venezuela. I also had my all time favorite Pelua which is pulled beef with grated cheese, awesome."}
{"text":"Food: good but nothing too special. One of our friends found a hair in the plate.

Service: super slow we waited for one hour for the plates to come and waitress didn't even fill the empty bottles for us. We came around 1pm, the restaurant was not full, it seems they are short of the staffs.

Overall, I would give zero star if I could for the sake of the \"fast\" service."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and was excited to try it out. The place is super cute and intimate. 

I ordered a Beef, Plantain, Cheese and Beans Arepa. 
Servings are huge. I fell in love with my meal and ate my Arepa with the hot sauce on the table. I am from Pakistan and we love very spicy food so I was completely satisfied with my experience! Definitely coming here again!!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my recurring, awesome place to make sure I visit each time I visit Montreal from SF. The Venezuelan food is awesome, the atmosphere warm and welcoming. Very high on my favorites list! Had diner there again last night, and the arepas, platanos and deserts were, as expected, excellent!"}
{"text":"I must admit, I would never have thought I'd be eating authentic Venezuelan food in Montreal, but Montreal is very much an international city. 

Located in a small corner cafe setting, we we're not too shocked to see a group of people waiting outside to be seated. However, it didn't take long before we were seated and our orders taken. 

I ordered the shredded chicken plate with avocado sauce served with black beans, rice, fried plantains, and feta cheese. The food was very simple yet tasty. The popular (gluten-free) bread was served on the side which are made of corn and reminded me on an inside-out sope. For dessert, I had the plantain \"cheesecake\" that was really more like a warm pudding with a soft cinnamon bottom."}
{"text":"Sans Gluten. Tout le menu. Bons prix pour bonne portion et nourriture bien assaisonnée. Restaurant spécialisé dans les arepas, servit avec une petite salade de cresson et quelques chips de yucca. Options vegetaliennes tout aussi delicieuses.  Jus de fruits tropicaux à essayé. Service rapide, aimable et efficace. Si vous n'aimez pas le bruit, évitez les soirs de fin de semaine car il y a un chanteur avec guitare qui empeche toute conversation. J'y retourne souvent et je suis toujours satisfait."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to stop after watching the women's world cup match and a Copa match in one day. 

Arepera du Plateau boasts delicious, hot arepas made to order and that's exactly what we got. The waiter (owner?) served us and was awesomely friendly. He let us know the kitchen was closing soon and swiftly took our orders: un Popular y whatever my friend got.

El popular consists of ground beef and generous amounts of shredded cheddar cheese in a crispy, unsweetened corn pancake. For $8 it was surprisingly filling and incredibly tasty. The flavors were simple but abundant, it was served fresh, hot, and neatly wrapped, and came with a small side salad perfectly dressed. If you're kind of in the mood for a burger or sloppy joe type taste, get this one.

Service was really quick, and I was pleased to know (but way too full to order) they served a nice variety of smoothies. Tamarind, fruit, you name it, they'll make it fresh for you. 

If I was in the area, I would gladly come back again and recommend it to friends. Extra points for free candy on the counter."}
{"text":"Fresh food, smiling staff and convivial setting. Highly recommend the arepas here! Their fruit juices are also the perfect match to their well-executed food. 
My meat was juicy and tender, the plantains cooked perfectly, and their avocado based sauce was on target.
Try the yuca frita while you wait for your food to arrive. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place, I went last night for the first time and I've been craving it all day! The food seems simple but it is SOOO TASTY! Although the wait was long, it was so worth it. Also what I love about it is that it's gluten-free and they have vegan and vegetarian options. I got the grilled vegetables plate and it was amazing. I'm definitely going back within the next week!!"}
{"text":"First time eating Venezuelan food, and am quite satisfied. The sandwiches come with a side of salad and are quite filling for 10 bucks. Lovely atmosphere with the music playing in the background. However tables are quite cramped due to the small size of the restaurant.

Good for student budgets."}
{"text":"Born in Venezuela though a Chicago resident, I've seen my fair share of Venezuelan areperas and restaurants. This one is by far the best food I've had outside of Venezuela. I had La llanera which had a delicious pulled pork filling, stuffed with cheese and avocados. I also had the smoked salmon arepa. Both were large portions and reasonably priced. I should have only done one but I had to try more than one.

They come with a light salad. Make sure you add the avocado sauce.... a staple in Venezuelan cuisine. The atmosphere brought me memories of my childhood back in Venezuela....filled with music and a laid back ambience.

I wish there was a restaurant like this back in Chicago. In the mean time, this will be a for-sure stop next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"While a friend and I were staying on Montreal in mid March, I was on the hunt for a restaurant that had gluten-free options (my friend unfortunately has a gluten intolerance so I wanted to make sure she was able to eat some good food!) - the hunt led to Arepera du Plateau. We were seated right away (we came in around 4 or 5pm roughly? So an early dinner and before the dinner rush) and while service was a little slow (there were other people getting their food and it looked like there was only one MAYBE two waitresses working at the time), the wait was worth it!

I had the Carne Mechada arepa and my friend had the Pollo Guisado arepa. Both dishes came with a simple salad with an avocado dressing. We also ordered a appetizer of fried plantains. For dessert I had the coconut flan and she had a plantain cheesecake. We both left with satisfied taste buds and full stomachs! If I loved closer to Montreal, I probably would pop into this place every now and then because of how good it was!"}
{"text":"This place is a must! If you have never went to Arepera, you just have to go. I recommend it 6 stars out of 5 if I could.

I'll start with the service and the ambiance before going into food. Service was amazing. Our waitress was extremely nice to explain the menu, and also was super friendly. The ambiance is great as they play some latin american music so it felt as if we were in Venezuela.

Now for the food part, that is where we were thrilled! We had some Yucca Fries with the Guasacaca sauce and it was probably our favourite thing out of the night. They were crispy but not oily at all. I wondered how they did it! For our entrées, we had two meal plates with Rice, Bean, Fried Plantain, and chicken. We loved it!

Totally recommend!

PS: Small restaurant. Come early to avoid waiting lines! We were here at 5:30PM on Saturday and it was full!"}
{"text":"Super sympathique et très très bon, je recommande, une famille très accueillante, le mieux est toujours impeccable, la nourriture fraîche !"}
{"text":"Ok I'm impressed!

I drove past this place all summer and it was always full at lunch. I finally got my chance to go in at around 2 o'clock when it wasn't quite so full. And it was worth the wait!

The food was surprisingly good. Funny how it doesn't take much to impress you when you walk in with a skeptical attitude. And the friendly staff don't hurt either.

I haven't been to Venezuela, but I would imagine this is as authentic as you'll find in Montréal. I highly recommend you pay a visit at some point."}
{"text":"Really tasty and cheap Venezuelan arepas. I had #8, with chorizo and onions for $7. Comes with refreshing salsa on the side. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great little spot if you're looking for a tasty, filling meal for cheap. The atmosphere is similar to a diner, and best for a lunch with a friend or a quick, cheap supper. Avocado sauce on everything, pretty much. The corn bread is great, but expands in your stomach after you eat it, so be careful not to overeat. I went for a fast and easy supper and in the end, ordered too much food because I didn't realize how filling the sandwiches would be. A sandwich is enough, believe me. Very friendly cooks and a jovial atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was great. Appearance leaves something to be desired, but the food is fantastic. The raw sugar cane and lemon juice (traditional Venezuelan drink) is unbelievable. You'd think it would taste like lemonade but it tastes so so much better than that. I also had the Smoked Salmon Avocado Arepa with added sauteed veggies... Delicious! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. And the portions are so big you will not leave unsatisfied. 

Highly recommended, decently priced. Give it a try for sure if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ugh just heavenly! It's a smaller place than I thought but the wait shouldn't be too long if you don't come with a huge group. I've lived in South America before and this was very close to the delicious food I ate there. Plantains were made to perfection and the service was pretty good. Make sure you go slow on the red sauce they give you though - it's spicy and I usually have a pretty high spice tolerance!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Arepas (or Venezuelan food in general) and i'm glad Arepera  was my first stop! I ordered La Llanera and a side of the yuca sticks - both were amazing and made fresh. They came with a side of avocado sauce and spicy sauce that tasted great with the arepa. I also ordered their freshly made passion fruit juice which was light and refreshing. 

All in all a must try at reasonable prices. Will definitely drop by when i'm back in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Holy cow (no pun intended). This place has some seriously good eats that are affordable and tummy-stuffing all at once, and it felt like home the minute I stepped in. The walls are adorned with paintings and photographs of notable musicians from the 60s and 70s like The Beatles, making me feel like I was stepping back in time to one of my favorite eras musically. Also, it gave me the vibe of a cute mom-and-pop shop, with a really easygoing vibe but fast service and low wait times.

I ordered the mango juice; the beef, avocado, and cheese Arepa, and a small bowl of rice pudding for dessert. The mango juice was fresh and not artificially sweet, and it proved to be a great palate cleanser for the salty Arepa, whose chunky, meaty texture contrasted well with the smooth flavors of the avocado and the body of the cheese. For some reason, I thought it would be smaller than it actually was from the pictures, but it tasted so much like home cooking and comfort food within the soft, corn-based bread that I didn't mind getting more. Also, the watercress salad was refreshing and paired perfectly with the tangy dressing, making me happy to eat my greens for once. Finally, the rice pudding was the finale to an already great show, and the cinnamon-y, creamy goodness made it light but enjoyable at the same time.

Arepera is a place that I highly recommend if you want Venezuelan food served up with a smile. It will make your day on all fronts because of how genuinely passionate everyone seems about the food served there. You definitely don't want to skip it!"}
{"text":"Being Venezuelan, I had to try this little spot who i now qualify as a little gem of Montreal. It's very authentic and the server was super nice and had the heaviest Caraqueño accent, which i wish i had. 

Try the perico with ham and cheese arepa. It's always been my favorite and you don't find it at most north american Venezuelan restaurants. It's something my mum would make.

They are short of a star because they didn't have natilla (venezuelan sour cream/creme cheese), empanadas. Oh and because no one makes better arepas than my mum!!"}
{"text":"The \"Arepa\" is something between a corn tortilla and a slice of bread, probably best described as a slightly leavened corn pancake. They are used as the \"bread\" in your delicious Latin sandwich filled with your choice of toppings that include carne machada (shredded beef), cheese, black bean, plantain, avacado, or even more exciting filling like smoked pork chops or shark. Arepera du Plateau has lots of vegetarian and vegan options too, which is good news for a devoted omnivore with a vegetarian partner, such as myself!

This was my first-ever arepa, but my partner has sampled them before elsewhere -- he praised the light fluffiness of these Plateau arepas, and I agree that there's a wonderful, filling, comfort-food quality to these fluffy flatbreads. Unsurprisingly, the owner told us that these were indeed the comfort food of his native Venezuela: his family eats them every day. We were both waddling out after eating a combined total of four areperas, plus delicious dessert.

If I have one thing I'd change about the arepas, it's that I found them a bit dry or overly simple with only a few ingredients each; perhaps I'm too used to North American sandwiches loaded with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I highly recommend the sauces, which you can get at your table for asking; the tangy avocado sauce is quite good and if you are interested in spicy, the chili sauce will shoot steam out your ears. Personally I was happy that the fare was quite mild, but the aforementioned partner likes steam shooting from his ears."}
{"text":"If you've never had Venezuelan, come here! Had to order take out because they were closing soon. The food tastes good, but portions could be a bit larger. Definitely order a juice, they're freshly made! 

The restaurant is quite small with only 1 girl at the cashier and another girl working the floor, perhaps they need one more person to help out with such a large hungry crowd. They forgot utensils and my friend's arepas in the combo. Had to check and go back. But the blonde waitress was super nice, the brunette could have been more accommodating."}
{"text":"The food was excellent here. It was one of the best meals we had in Montreal. It started with a nice, freshly cooked arepa that tasted great. Next was a plate of meat, black beans, and rice. There were two sauces that were very interesting. They added quite a bit to the meal. Overall this was excellent if you like South American food."}
{"text":"For the fresh faced, wide-eyed tourist to Montreal, this place definitely tests your linguistic skills and culture shock. It was amazing to me to hear French first, Spanish - and then English.   Mind you, they speak English everywhere in Montreal but on my first day here, it was still taking some adjusting to.

This is a small Venezuelan restaurant with a family run feel. Food focused with homeland inspired decor are what you will notice upon walking in.  Give yourself a few moments and your ears will be filled with house mixes of every single famous Latin singer you can think of. I loved it! 

The main focus is the arepa.  Something I first heard of on an episode of Bobby Flays Throw down (he lost).  It is a South American bread made of corn not flour so are an excellent gluten free option.  They can be grilled, baked or fried. The exterior tends to be on the crunchier side while the interior has a more gritty, texturized interior.

I chose the stewed chicken arepa and my friend had the shark arepa. (As a side note, the menu is also in English).  I was most curious to try the shark.  They are presented stuffed into the arepa with a side  watercress salad. Hot sauce and avocado dressing/sauce to flavour.

The shark tasted like, well, fish. I had no idea what I was expecting but it certainly tasted flatter than my expectation.  It was flaky like canned tuna.  Same with the chicken arepa which incidentally drips like crazy. Be warned if you are wearing something light. It is messy.

The cassava chips were crispy and even better with the addictive avocado dip. The avocado sauce was an incredible surprise to me! I don't like avocado and however they make this stuff, made me love it.  I can still taste it.  So good!

Incredibly inexpensive, friendly people and quick service. You really can't go wrong in trying something different."}
{"text":"Je ne connaissais pas la cuisine vénézuélienne mais je ne regrette pas d'être entrée dans ce petit restaurant coloré  à l'ambiance dépaysante à la musique joyeuse. 

Deja, presque tout est sans gluten ici. En effet, la spécialité ici est l'arepa, soit un petit sandwich rond à base de maïs, toasté et fourré d'à peu près ce qu'on veut. Le choix sur la carte est immense : viande, poisson, végétarien, vegetaLien. La portion servie est généreuse, accompagnée d'une micro salade, et suffit largement à un bon repas. Et ce à partir de 6,50$ !

J'en ai pris un aux bananes plantains (je ne connaissais pas mais j'adore !) et haricots noirs que j'ai trouvé très savoureux. On peut assaisonner à souhait avec deux sauces : une verte et une rouge (je ne peux pas vraiment vous en dire plus ahah).
Pour accompagner ça, un petit jus maison de \"Lulo\" (fruit choisi au hasard parmi d'autres tout aussi mysterieux), apparemment un fruit à mi-chemin entre l'orange et le kiwi, mais pour moi beaucoup moins acide. C'était très doux et original, et puis c'est toujours un plaisir de découvrir des saveurs inconnues ! 

Je m'en suis sortie pour moins de 11$ hors tips pour une belle expérience gustative donc oui, 5 étoiles !"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, took the avocado plate with black beans, rice, plantin and cheese and it was amazing. Owner was very cool and welcoming, the place was well decorated with good music. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Never having tried any Venezuelan food Arepera's was a great choice to experiment. Nervous for vegetarian options I was happy to see the offered vegetarian arepas. Arepas are a Venezuelan staple, it's a corn breaded hand held size sandwich. I ordered one filled with plantains, black beans and feta cheese. I enjoyed the sweet and salty flavors with every bite. My boyfriend ordered a chicken arepa that came with shredded chicken cooked in a tomato sauce and cheddar cheese. We both enjoyed our meals, we weren't starving so the meal was the right size if you're in search of something lighter."}
{"text":"One arepera is plenty for lunch. They're super filling and the guasacaca sauce is amazing. You can purchase it if you like it."}
{"text":"I have never had arepas before, but I fear the bar has been set very high.  I ordered La Llanera (beef with feta cheese and avocado). The arepa itself was delicious, but the meat was the real star of the show. I could have eaten a plateful. The avocado was perfectly ripe, and the feta was an unexpectedly great combination. Also ordered a house-made juice, which was amazing. The meal was quite cheap and extremely filling."}
{"text":"I'm super down with Arepera (and loving the Palindrome restaurant name too!)

I actually had never heard of an arepa before and I'll have to say, I've been missing out! Not really knowing what to expect, two of my friends and I decide to head on over, and try this little gem of a place out! 

Holy cow! Sooo many options. After narrowing down, the options: I settled on a vegan choice of tomato, avocado, coriander, and lemon and added some delicious cheese (recommendation from the server!) Totally filling, totally delicious, my friends chose the chorizo sandwich, and another the same as me with added beef. We also ordered the Yuca chips and guacamole sauce. One amazing thing, is the offer of DIY saucing of your sandwich, that was a huge bonus! Can't wait to show all my friends this wonderful place."}
{"text":"J'avais quelques attente sur cet endroit et j'en ressors un peu déçu mais je m'explique.

Déçu au final par mon choix car j'ai pris une arepa qui au final n'avait pas le gout qui allait bien. En effet celle au chorizo me tentait vraiment mais malheureusement la somme des ingrédients fait que cela est bof. Il y avait juste du chorizo (en gros morceau en plus donc galère à manger car le morceau entier vient quand on croque ...) et des poivrons grillés ... Pas de petite sauce pour lier les 2, juste ces 2 ingrédients plus le pain. Du coup le résultat au final est bof.

Les autres arepas que j'ai goûté étaient meilleurs car justement il y avait ce petit truc qui faisait que cela créait une \"cohésion\".

Mention spéciale pour les jus de fruit maison et surtout frais qui sont excellent. Pour le coup les jus valent 5* voir plus :) En plus on parle de fruit vraiment exotique et qui changent des jus classique

Si j'avais pu j'aurais mis 3.5. Je reviendrais car je sens un réel potentiel dans ce restaurant. Je réviserais ma note alors :)"}
{"text":"The food here is exceptionally fresh and there are options for carnivores and vegans alike.  Everyone was well-fed and happy.  I had the black bean Arepa which comes with a small salad and plantains.  I also had a side salad - very fresh watercress salad.  So delicious.  There were 2 sauces - a VERY spicy red one and a milder, but flavorful, green one.  It is a small, cozy, casual place.  Oh SO good.  Nothing went to waste.  The arepas and the plantains are a little greasier than what I usually eat, but OH, SOOO tasty!"}
{"text":"Another day out in Montreal looking for good food and finding it thanks to Yelp.  I love arepas, and Arepera du Plateau delivered.  Walked in planning to get something with avocadoes, and was steered towards #8 \"La Llanera\" which is \"carne mechada\" with feta cheese and avocado.  Delicious, big, and came with a little salad with avocado dressing maybe?  I dunno but it was good.  Enjoyed both the avocado sauce and the hot sauce, too.  Quick service, too!"}
{"text":"L'avantage de commander pour tes amies c'est que tu peux goûter à plusieurs sortes d'arepas dans le même repas ;) J'ai été à l'Arepera 2 fois (une pour emporter et une pour manger sur place) et j'ai été très satisfaite de mes deux expériences. Le service a été très courtois et rapide dans les deux cas et la bouffe, absolument délicieuse! Je vous recommande fortement d'essayer cet endroit, la petite file d'attente en vaut la peine et ça fait juste confirmer à quel point c'est excellent! 

Bonus, lorsque nous avons mangé sur place il y avait un petit groupe de musique live. Très agréable et chaleureux!

See you soon Arepera!"}
{"text":"La sureña and la llenera were so good we're talking about coming back for dinner tonight. Gluten free beer was another pleasant surprise for me, a recently diagnosed gluten-intolerant who used to love beer."}
{"text":"We chose the place because it was suggest by tripadvisor as family friendly. Indeed, it is. We loved the warm atmosphere and welcoming staff. About the food. The bean soup ordered for my 2 years old was too salty and she didn't eat it. My other kids ordered arepos and they were too dry and difficulty to eat. I took a vegetarian plate with guacamole, rice, beans and fried platans and it was ok. Actually, the platans are really delicious so order them as a  side dish. Anyway, we loved the place and we are very thankful for everything especially after all the mess our kids left there."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food definitely gets a 5 star, I gave it a 4 because of the service. We've been many times and for a place that always has a lineup, it's a bit slow and the waitresses aren't very helpful/enthusiastic. I guess you can lack on the service when the food compensates for it,"}
{"text":"A+! Hand-made corn-flour bread that's 100% gluten free tastes awesome. The La Sunera ($9) I ordered included an amazing avocado sauce and pork mix, and had a side of unlimited hot sauce (super spicy and awesome) and an extra mix of creamy avocado sauce on the side.
The chicken soup ($5) was also very hearty, with potato, corn and shredded chicken. Really tasted homemade, with more emphasis on the chicken soup than thickener.
Would definitely come again, a true hidden gem in Montreal."}
{"text":"WOW. This place is amazing. The atmosphere is really cool. The decor gives of a Latin vibe and there are mountains of avocados/ plantains right near the kitchen. There are also long benches for people who are waiting to sit on so it wasn't a bad 20 minute wait at 9pm on a Saturday night. 

The menu is extensive ranging from different arepa sandwiches (vegetarian options too) to plates. All of the arepa's are gluten-free as well! 

We ordered the yuca fries with green avocado sauce to start with. Let me tell you, this sauce is something I should smuggle back to the US.. I could eat SO much of the sauce.. dipping it with bread, arepas, potatoes, anything.

I ordere an arepa with chicharron, black beans, and avocado. It was AMAZING!!! The sandwich was so hot, the chicharron was cooked  so well, and the best part is that the sandwich was only $10 CAD. I would definitely come back here, and the staff like working here so it's a plus for everyone. 

(Music is also really good)"}
{"text":"Très familial. Mais les plats sont trop rustiques....... J'ai commandé un plat de riz, de l'haricot noir et de l'uf. Mon père a commandé du porc ( recommande par le patron). Ils sont tous pas mal, mais peu spécial. Ces plats peuvent être très facilement faits à la maison."}
{"text":"Arepera du Plateau...more a miss than a hit... I came to this place with a friend because I read the review on The Gazette I was truly disappointed. I ordered a pabellon with chicken and my guest a pabellon with cazon (shredded shark), plus a mango juice and a guanabana (soursop) juice. The food was tasteless, boiled rice without a trace of onion, garlic, bell pepper or even salt...the black beans they seemed to be straight from the can and reheated, again no spicy flavor at all..the shark was more like canned tuna (as far as I know shark is a very expensive fish, so they should be charging more than 11 dollars for this so they can make some profit, which means that either they are losing money by serving shark, or the shark IS canned tuna)...the juices were watery, in substance and flavor, not a hint of sweetness, the only thing that we actually enjoyed were the tajadas (slices of fried ripe plantain, served with grated cheese).

The service was OK, I asked the waiter for tajadas and he had no clue of what I was ordering, which means he's not Venezuelan, but I must say that he was friendly even if a bit slow.

Unfortunately this was not a happy culinary experience, I lived in Venezuela for several years and I know what Venezuelan food is like, an exotic mixture Spanish cuisine with tropical accents, lots of garlic, onions, bell pepper, aji dulce, cumin, annato, I know that rice is boiled with a bit of oil, garlic, salt and a bell pepper to give it some flavor, I know what caraotas (black beans) are like, and cazon means cazon, not canned tuna. I have to say that  this place gives Venezuelan food a bad reputation, maybe they can get away with it because most of people in Montreal have not been exposed to Venezuelan food and don't know what real Venezuelan food tastes like... I lived in Venezuelan and quite honestly, I feel shortchanged. Perhaps I should get a copy of Mi Cocina by Armando Scanone and leave it at the counter.

And by the way, those joropos are way too loud and prevent customers from having a conversation without yelling at each other"}
{"text":"Cute cafeteria styled resto. They moved to this new location within the last year.  The converted church pew benches and colorful art add a sense of whimsy to the place. 

Service is really prompt so great place to stop by if you're starving and gotta eat like yesterday!! 

Highly recommend trying the juices they're refreshing! 

Food: we order two beef arepas--the pabellón and the popular and the shark meat one to share. The waitress brings our three arepas each with a crispy watercress salad and for some reason I mistake the shark meat for the beef pabellon!! 

All the while I'm munching on it, I'm totally confused cause shark meat tastes a bit like flaked tuna. It was a little bland so I drowned it in the avocado sauce. I kept thinking that it was a fishy tasting beef. Still couldn't figure it out! Lol

Then we shared the pabellón (which I still thought was the shark one) and to my surprise I was soooooo good with the sweetness from the fried plantains, the saltines of the feta, the garlic from the black beans and the meat all married so well together.  You must absolutely try this one if you eat meat!!! 

So finally I couldn't take it anymore, I show the waitress the photo of the shark arepas (which I still thought was the beef) and asked her if it was a wrong order to which she clarified that it was the shark arepas!!  I had eaten the shark one and shared the pabellon instead of visa versa!  Hence this is why we take photos of our food as Yelpers... It can help clarify mystery meat :P

The popular was quite good, cheesy. But I prefer the pabellon best! Must go back to try some more!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick bite after drinks and stumbled on this place. Came in at 9:56pm and they where nice to let me in as they close as 10. Honestly great food! Great prices and the food is super yummy. I had never tried Venezuelan before and I greatly enjoyed it. Cute hole in the wall with great food at a great price! I'll be back"}
{"text":"this place is SO delicious! we went for lunch. tried the cane sugar lemonade and the lulo juice, the fried plantains, and 2 different arepas. totally, amazingly delicious. our server was totally friendly and helpful, the food came in a decent amount of time for lunch, and dessert was good too. i liked it so much that i almost went back for dinner THE SAME NIGHT. this is my new favourite place!"}
{"text":"~ GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS ~

It's always so hard finding good GF restaurants if not GF options at many restaurants but it's safe to say that Arepera du Plateau is as GF as it gets. The last time we came, it was quite empty seeing as it was a week day but the food did not disappoint at all. (Came back on a Saturday and lines were long but moved quickly). You can't go wrong with a helping of plantain along with any sort of arepa."}
{"text":"This was a new and great experience.  And the locals love coming here. It's a very popular Venezuelan restaurant in Montreal.

I ordered the black beans and plantain arepa. The arepa is a corn based, popular homemade bread in Venezuela, stuffed with black beans and plantains. Absolutely delicious and gluten free!!!!  I added their famous avocado sauce to every bite. This simple, put together, like a wrap dish was a hit. Add a side of cassava fries and you have the perfect meal. The arepa and cassava fries could have easily been shared between 2 people, as it was quite filling for me. But if you're starving, go ahead and order your own.

You can order your arepa with chicken, pork, beef, vegetarian and very vegetarian. I didn't make that last one up, it actually says that on the menu. 

The restaurant is a bit smallish, so a group of 2 to 4 max is good. Their waiting list is a white board outside the restaurant, where you write your name and number of guests. There's also no room to wait inside for a table, so you have to wait outside to be called in. That part wasn't fun on a cold winter day. But I still gave it a five star because the food was that amazing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat this place all the time.  It's probably our favorite restaurant.  Everything is perfect.  It's a cute family-owned place with a homey ambience and friendly service.  But more than anything, the food is the bomb dot com.  The avocado sauce is the greatest thing on Earth, and all the flavors in the arepas explode in your mouth in perfect harmony.

Must go if you're in in Montréal."}
{"text":"Great arepas, delicious chicken soup and a staff that's as friendly as can be. The decor is great too."}
{"text":"If I can give the place zero stars, I would. After reading the reviews of this place, I had really high expectations and hopes that this restaurant was going to be really good but nope.

SERVICE:
My experience was terrible. We walked into the restaurant and a waitress just told us to sit. She did not give us any menus/water nor did she tell anyone else to take care of our table. For about 20 minutes, the owner/waitresses just walked by and did not even care to give us the menu/water. Only until I yelled: \"excuse me, could you give us the menu/water\" was when someone finally served our table. The waitress's excuse was \"oh, I didn't see you there\". Like what do you mean you didn't see us... are you all blind?? The amount of disrespect was ridiculous. After deciding what we wanted to order, no one came to take our order until I yelled: \"excuse me, can someone take our order?\". 

FOOD:
In terms of food, it was nothing special. The portions were ridiculously small for the price and nothing about it was delectable. We ordered the Chicken with Cheddar Cheese arepa (forgot which one on the menu specifically) and the Reina Pepiada, which was shredded chicken breast in avocado sauce. The arepa was bland and was not flavourful. The Reina Pepiada dish was not hot enough to my liking but there was no point in communicating my concerns when no one even bothered to provide good service to our table. The rice in the Reina Pepiada dish also tasted disgusting. 

Anyhow, this restaurant clearly does not deserve their 4.5/5 rating and I would not come back to this establishment ever again when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Lovely family owned business who cook with love.  It's authentic, delicious, clean and will put a smile on your face.  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We spent two weeks in Montreal and love to eat where the locals eat. This place was definitely a local favorite from what I could gather. There was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it! The arepas and plantains were amazing and i LOVE the shredded feta cheese they use. Their coconut flan was nothing like the flan I am used to and was more like a cheesecake to me, but was still delicious! I loved the old man who came in with his guitar as well. I am now back in Los Angeles and craving arepas! I am sure they will not compare to the ones i had at this establishment. Well worth the drive out of downtown and street parking was pretty easy to find"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time years ago based on a recommendation of my husband's cousin's wife who moved to Canada from Venezuela. Naturally, when she recommends good Venezuelan food, we are listening. I am so glad we followed her suggestion. We loved everything that we ate here at this family-owned and popular casual restaurant in the Plateau. Also, it is very family/kid-friendly!

Although I am no longer a committed vegetarian, I really appreciate any menu that offers vegetarian options and Arepera has many, many wonderful vegetarian and vegan options. Who knew that Venezuelans ate such a vegetarian diet? I was completely over the moon with my garlic mushrooms! Oh my gosh, even now I am thinking about how mouth-wateringly delicious they are! My husband and I shared the black beans and plantains and we loved every bit and bite of them!

One of my favorite parts of eating here is the bottomless bottle of avocado sauce that the server puts on our table! Bright green and fabulous on everything!

Before eating at Arepera, I mistakenly believed that Venezuelan food must be similar to food in Costa Rica or Mexico. It has been years since my first time at Arepera and oh how naive I was! There is something all together unique about Venezuelan food that deserves to be explored! If you have not tried Venezuelan food previously, then you really must start your exploration here, at Arepera!"}
{"text":"I am a gluten free vegan which makes it difficult to eat out most of the time. I live in NYC and came to Montreal for a weekend. We all know that Montreal is famous for its great restaurants but let me tell you this place is one of the reasons why! Amazing food, incredibly friendly staff, and the over all atmosphere makes you want to sit longer and just keep eating . I am praying that they will expand and open one in NYC. New York has many places where they make arepas but by far they can't be compare to these! Thank you for the hospitality and amazing food Please come to NYC and open a restaurant"}
{"text":"My boyfriend recently discovered this place and decided to introduce me to it. I have never had Venezuelan food and this was definitely a wonderful first for me. THe sandwiches on corn bread were fantastic and fresh out of the oven. The avocado salsa was wonderfully spicy and tasty. You get great food for a cheap price. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"update: the entire menu is now gluten-free!  they added a few new menu items including yucca fries (YUM) and empanadas (on my to-eat list).  I'm still sad that they don't serve alcohol (and are not BYOB/BYOW), but this place is definitely part of the regular rotation. My favorite arepa filling is the reina pepiada -- think guacamole mixed with shredded chicken."}
{"text":"This place introduced me (and perhaps the city) to the Arepas. These soft corn based bread which is stuffed with awesomeness, be it meat, poultry or veggies.

The Arepa (bread) is gluten free, so yay for celiac sufferers, the other ingredients I am not sure. Vege friendly yes, vegan friendly - not to my knowledge.

If people LOVE their spicy sauce, they have two excellent sauces. The red sauce has lots of heat (go easy on this one) and their green sauce is avocado based with a touch of cilantro/coriander and is packed with flavour.

Messy eaters be warned, the stuffing can fall out so eat in small bites and use food physics to your advantage!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 6 and were seated right away. We ordered 3 different arepas (2. Pabellon 3.La Pelua and 13. La Surena) It is very filling. A order of yuca and empanadas were good but had better in our hometown of Chicago. We tried a gluten free beer and a Lula drink very interesting. We enjoyed the meal not sure if we would rush back but the service was good and left a strong impression."}
{"text":"yes yes yes. 

love this place and everything about it. 
The prices - Yes
The food - Yes
the live music?! - Yes
the service - Yes
the ambience - Yes

Everything about Arepera du plateau is such a yes. There tends to be a bit of a wait when you get there but their system is efficient so it doesn't take to long. The menu is simple and delightful - if you don't get their yuca chips + avocado sauce you're making a life mistake. If you go at around 7pm there is a live musician who plays latino music and sings with this beautiful soulful voice. It's a quick service and the waiters and sweet. The prices are an icing on the cake. 

Advice: make sure you get the avocado and spicy sauce for your arepera; adding an extra squeeze of sauce after every few bites is integral to the experience! (warning the spicy sauce is SPICY!)"}
{"text":"This place is the joint. I read the rave reviews on Yelp and had to check it out. I'm so glad I did. I came around 12:15 on a Sunday and they were already filling up. By 12:45 the place had a waiting list going on. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is pleasant and great music to match the food. The food was amazing!!! Fresh, flavorful and delicious. I was so overwhelming pleasantly surprised. It's not everyday your taste buds are completely blown away."}
{"text":"Petit endroit sympathique et coloré, sans prétention.  Prix plus qu'abordables, nourriture 100% sans gluten, c'est déjà beaucoup...  D'accord, ce ne sont pas les meilleurs sandwichs que j'ai mangés, mais ils demeurent très bons. Le pain est remplacé par une arepa, galette de maïs tendre et chaude, dommage que la viande à l'intérieur (boeuf effiloché braisé longtemp) soit un tantinet fade.  On vous sert toutefois deux pots de sauce maison (délicieuses) qui permettent de d'équilibrer les saveur.  À recommander."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Caracas in NYC! The restaurant is pretty small with maybe 10 tables. The wait is pretty easy for a party of 2 (around 15 mins or so), but another party of 4 probably waited closer to 45 mins-1 hr.

Make sure to get the fresh squeezed juices. They are $3 each, and there are many varieties. We had the passion fruit, which was very good and refreshing.

One arepa per person here is enough for a meal (vs. I can eat 2-3 at Caracas). These arepas are stuffed to the max and each come with a small salad with nuts and avocado cream.

We ordered:
#32 tomato, coriander, avocado and added roasted pork for $2. This one was okay. It tasted like pork with salsa in an arepa. 
#1 carne mechada (also known as ropa vieja or shredded beef) with black beans, cheese, and plantains. This one was delicious, probably why it's #1 on the menu. It's a classic with succulent and tender beef paired with the sweet and soft plantains.
The arepa itself is really good. It tastes fresh, and it is has a soft interior but chewy exterior. 

Accepts credit cards, we didn't have any trouble with not speaking French, and street parking was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Thank you for having vegan options! I really enjoyed the arepa itself and it made me think out of the box in terms of sandwiches. I'd definitely come again, the cassava fries were also super tasty with the dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"Excelente!!!  Recomiendo cualquier tipo de pabellon.  Los ingredientes son frescos y los platos son presentados en forma creativa.  El quesillo, muy rico!!!  Muy buen servicio, familiar."}
{"text":"Espectacular! 

I had a soup (house courtesy), an arepa of chicken and avocado and the cheese flan dessert. Everything was just great, the owner and waiters are very kind and everything was fast and friendly. 
Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing arepas and wonderful dishes, Arepera is a fantastic choice for vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike.

Service was great even though the place was packed and busy. Food came out relatively quickly. Prices are affordable, ambiance is very casual. 

I ordered the Pabellón de pollo (black beans, shredded chicken, plantains, and cheese) and my boyfriend ordered La Llanera (shredded beef in a tomato sauce with cheese and avocado). We also ordered a side of plantains. All I have to say is ... wow! 

The portions are large, the arepas are stuffed to the brim, and the flavors are on point. Served with a delicious avocado sauce and a (very spicy) hot sauce, these really hit the spot. I found myself drowning every bite with avocado sauce. I would've been embarrassed if everyone else wasn't doing the same!

Can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner and this will certainly become a go-to for us!"}
{"text":"Revelatory comfort food.. I've known about the arepa trend for a while, have had a few, but these guys nailed it.  Really comforting, sane portions, good fast service, clean and fresh ingredients. 

 I've gone back here numerous times and have always been satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly owners, reasonable prices... What more could you ask for (well maybe a cold beer and/or a glass of wine but not here, oh well, eat fast and drink down the street :)"}
{"text":"The arapas are amazing! The service is snappy and the atmosphere is very festive. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat in the plateau check this place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved loved loved the food here. It's a little cozy place, perfect for a quick lunch with your buddies. The portions are quite generous and it is so filling, so sharing is always a good idea :) 
We took the yummy sweet fried plantains, crunchy cassava sticks and each had an arepa filled with avocado and chicken and we basically rolled out of there. 
Would definitely come back anytime!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh arepas. Though they were out of yuca chips, the plantains were tasty. Fresh juice-yum. Good service.

Don't forget -avocado sauce and hot sauce on EVERY bite."}
{"text":"Wow. another year between reviews.  Time flies when your having... 

Fantastic evening. Great company, great arepas, to die for avocado dressing, a charming atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  Never felt rushed.  We spent 2 hours here, just eating, talking, and smiling."}
{"text":"I went out with my husband for dinner last weekend. A cozy little place on Duluth. It is a heaven for people who want 'gluten-free' meals. We tried their special sandwich meal. It was delicious. The place has warm vibes...always hustling and bustling with people and music. There is a line up for the table, hence keep that in mind for planning your visit. They have live music, a guitarist who comes by your table randomly playing interesting music and singing. The customers really enjoy this and the whole place breaks into a chorus, clapping and whistling. The service is quick and attentive. Definitely a place to visit again and again."}
{"text":"I forgot to write my review, I went there in Summer of 2015.
I was recently thinking about this place and how I want to go back. 
I'll try to keep it shor there's already so many reviews that summarize it well: 
-Amazing fresh food. 
-Different than your usual south american good.
-Gluten free (made of corn flour on what feels like a Crepe/Bread  freshly cook).
-The service was great. The owner was there and going to each guest thanking us for our business.
-The price was low and the choices was nice.
I remember taking the one with cheese, guacamole and chicken. It was delicious. 
This is a very comforting meal and very great during the Summer."}
{"text":"Everywhere you go, things are rush, rush, rush. And sure, I love speedy service as much as the next guy, but sometimes, a good meal is worth the wait. 

As you probably guessed by the intro, Arepara probably isn't somewhere you'd want to go on a whim if you're looking for a quick snack, but if you don't mind hanging out for a little, you'll be treated to one of the best arepas in town. 

I can't say that I have a favourite, but make sure you get one with avocado and cheese. Regardless though, you're in for a seriously satisfying sandwich. 

Oh, and they're all gluten-free!"}
{"text":"What a nice Canadian surprise! I'm by no means an Arepa expert but this was my favorite to date. Sturdy arepa outside and soft flavorful inside. The avocado sauce is to die for. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough meat in the arepa but overall it was great! Also had the mango juice and woah, tasted like I was eating a Mango off a tree. Excellent! Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Will certainly come back when I get the chance."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night around 7:00pm and the atmosphere was really fun. Everyone seemed to be laughing and enjoying themselves. The art on the walls and the church benches add a unique touch to this wonderfully located resto. It is perfect for a group of friends.

My friend and I arrived and were quickly seated while a small line formed behind us. We ordered plantains to start and she ordered a chicken arepera. I ordered the Dómino con plátano which is black beans, plantains and feta cheese. I changed the feta to andino cheese for no extra charge. This was the first arepera that I ever had and I really enjoyed it. The sweetness and saltiness melted together perfectly.  I would skip on ordering plantains next time as the portion is pretty small and they come in many of the areperas. Overall, I enjoyed my meal. Really great prices too. The service was good but a bit slow and the waiters were nice.

Looking forward to coming back and trying something else off the menu. Lots of vegetarian/vegan and meat options."}
{"text":"Oh my, where do I begin. I could eat here for the rest of my life. The avocado sauce is literal heaven, you guys really came up with something wonderful. Everything from the plantains, to the arepas, to the empanadas is delicious. And its fantastic they moved to a bigger space! No more waiting. I will be back, over and over again. If you're craving Latin food, head on over to Arepera you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant vénézuélien mais dommage petite portion , plats sans gluten , les végétariens trouvent leur compte aussi , je ne mets un 5 étoiles car le service est très très long 45 min d'attente c'est beaucoup , la musique est sympa aussi"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Montreal I make it a point to return to Arepera. It's food is so good, that I want to try everything on the menu. Service is amazing and they are very friendly with the customers. Prices are affordable for the great quality of the food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is my kind of place in terms of ambiance, but the food was tasty and unique. The restaurant is small and crowded, it's hot - no A/C. We got there early so we had no problem getting a table, but by the time we left there was a lineup. The prices are cheap - $9 for an Arepa. No alcohol but they have juices  that are traditional to Columbia / Venezuela. I prefer a place that I can have a few drinks, talk with friends, order a few plates to share - this is not a sharing plates kind of place and as long as you know that before you go you can plan accordingly. I wasn't sure what to expect having never been there, and while I was happy with my sandwich and salad it was a quick meal. The service was great - they made good recommendations and were friendly / polite / professional. Good place to go if you are hungry and looking for cheap eats."}
{"text":"Some of the best arepas I've had anywhere and this restaurant is truly a piece of real Venezuela in Montreal. 

The soup and appetizers are great. The juices are fresh. The quesillo is amazing and the arepas are really filling, but the best part is the service. The owner really knows how to make you feel welcome and you'll be want to come back for sure. 

Top notch everything. Viva Venezuela!"}
{"text":"\"Delicious, just like in Venezuela !\"

- Delicious venezuelian food (Arepas, Pabellón, ....)
- Tropical juices
- Cheap and good portions
- Vegan & gluten free
- Located on the heart of Le Plateau, on Duluth street, corner De Bullion"}
{"text":"Decided to visit Arepera, excited to dabble into Venezuelan cuisine.

Arepas are traditional hand-made bread made entirely from corn. The Chuleta Ahumada was filled with smoked pork chops and the Pabellón with black beans, Carne Mechada (Venezuelan shredded beef), plantain, and feta; $9 each. Both picks were savoury and satisfying.

The. sauces. Both the avocado and hot sauce were amazing. Definitely recommend keeping those on hand to add on every bite.

Unique selection of exotic fruit juices at $3 each; taste was average but worth trying. Tried Jugo de Guanábana (soursop) and Jugo de Lulo (an orange-like fruit native to South America).

Tasty, affordable, and surprisingly filling comfort food in a fast casual setting."}
{"text":"Best 
Probé las arepas en Venezuela hace unos años y fue una sorpresa muy agradable encontrarme con este lugar tan bien situado en Montreal. La comida es muy rica, los precios accesibles y el trato muy amable. Fue bueno sentir la calidez latinoamericana en medio de una tormenta de nieve. Muy recomendado."}
{"text":"I came to Montreal for the weekend and as always I don't go out to eat without checking yelp and came a long this little venezuelian place. I have to say i was hooked immediately being from NY I had my experiences with arepas and I have to say this time was even better. I had two and their where great, I had the chicken in advicado sauce and chicken chorizo with grill onions and peppers and my girlfriend had the Ham and Cheese with perico. All three where great so I highly recommended it. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing arepas hand made. The entire menu is gluten free. Great ambiance and would love the art walls for my place!"}
{"text":"I haven't had arepas like this since Venezuela. Hard to find a good authentic one, this place did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Arepera for ages, however, the long lines and wait times in the summer months discouraged me. With that said, I couldn't be happier that I finally got the opportunity to dine here because this restaurant is definitely one of my new favourites. 

Upon walking in, my friend and I were greeted with a smile and seated quickly. The place itself is quite small, and only has a few tables. I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and the music. Moreover, the waitresses kept samba dancing to the music behind the counter with one of the cooks and it was super entertaining. 

The menu is amazing. There is literally something for every type of eater, and there are sections for vegetarians, vegans, and those with no restrictions. The prices are also super cheap and you get a solid portion. My favourite part is that everything here is 100% gluten free. The food was excellent. I was also happy with the service. One of the waitresses brought us a few sauces and made sure to tell us exactly what was in them which I really appreciated. 

All in all, I have zero complaints and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I would like to give it five stars as I really love it so much. The arepa, the pulled chicken, pulled beef, smoked sandwich, black beans, fried plantain, avocado sauces...... everything is so amazing. Besides that, they have very good service and vibe. We girls were seated by the window, and enjoyed a great time. I would definitely come back for more choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Tucked away in a more.reaisential part if the neighbourhood, the fresh juices were.refreshing and the menu was carried and I incredibly reasonably priced.  The yuca.fries were a nice snack to start but portions are generous so.comw hungry.  T ake note this place is not licensed.  Still the areas were soft and moist and flavourful and the chicharrone delicious.  Will visit again"}
{"text":"simple, healthy and filling! nothing super special but good for a quick bite. i had the grilled vegetable plate and the beans, plantains, and bread were delicious but the grilled vegetables were pretty overdone and not great. the two people i was with both enjoyed their food thoroughly though!"}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant in an off the strip road. The place can accommodate around 30 people, total. There is a waitlist by the door. The food selection is great and the arepas are very delicious. You can try them in many different ways-I had the chicharron (cracklings) with black beans. Just need to add a bit of the guasacaca sauce and boom, you wont stop until you're done with it. They also have house made juices!!"}
{"text":"Montreal is bustling with amazing food and Arepera is at the top of that list. I went there following a recommendation by a friend who went to McGill for college. She said that their pork arepas were amazing. I trusted this friend so I had no choice but to go to Arepera.

Thankfully, Arepera did not let me down. I got a beef and a chicken arepa. Both were incredible, particularly the beef one. Although the arepas themselves were incredible, what really put this place in the 5 star category were the sauces. Sauces will make or break any meal and thankfully they made it here. They have a green, herby  sauce and a red hot(ish) sauce. A little drizzle of each will go a long way. And by a little, I mean a lot.

We got here about a half hour after it opened on a weekday and this place was already packed, so I knew from the start it was going to be good. Make sure to make the trip out to Arepera when visiting Montreal and make sure to get there early."}
{"text":"Yummy, affordable and filling!

I took the chicken with beans, plantains and feta cheese arepa and once I took the first bite--i noticed the bun was amazing! It's a corn bun and it was so chewy, warm and moist! The plate also came with a small salad with avocado sauce which was great as well--just wish there was more salad than just less than a handful. Although the place may be small, it's pretty cozy and cute--not to mention pretty affordable (bill was around $11)!

Would love to come again some day *o*"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my family based on yelp reviews. We were quite disappointed with the food. The food had no sabor/ flavor. We ordered the arepa with chicken and the pollo guisado plate. We are a Latin family and know how to cook Latin food. The pollo guisado is shredded tasteless chicken. It didn't have any sofrito or tomato taste. The black beans were hard and bland. The rice tasted like minute rice."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very nice restaurant. Love the decor, it gives off a Latin vibe but it's not overwhelming. Plus, the benches are church benches which I thought was pretty unique.

FOOD: Their food was delicious. The bread was out of this world! First time having arepas and definitely not the last. The pork was super flavorful and the watercress salad it comes with (although the portion is tiny) was pretty good as well. Plus, they have a homemade avocado sauce which is amazing. And their spicy sauce is awesome as well. For appetizers, I had cassava sticks with avocado sauce. Yum!!

PRICE: Prices are very affordable. The arepas are about 8-9$ and the sides are about 5$. Totally worth it.

SERVICE: The staff was super friendly! They're efficient and you can tell that they just want you to enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"First time having areperas and I love it! This is such a cute little place and the people are very friendly. I got the black beans with plantain and it was wonderful. They give you avocado sauce and hot sauce so you can mix it up a bit. Everything is gluten-free and they have both a vegetarian and a vegan section. Prices are great and very affordable. I would definitely come back next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Cheap and deelish, I adore this place. Tiny, cute little spot  with lots of choices for vegetarians and when the guy warns you that the sauce is hot, it's actually hot! The juice bar has to be my favourite part though: fresh passion fruit juice? Hell yeah."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Montreal! What an experience! From the minute we walked in, the owner Max treated us like FAMILY and made our experience unique. The food was beyond amazing and Max (owner) even brought us out an appetizer that he's planning to add to the menu soon- very exclusive! When the juices came out, he also brought a traditional Venezuelan juice for the table for us to taste. The service is also excellent. They are so attentive and accommodating!  My cousins birthday was also tonight and I told him and he came with a flan signing happy birthday and cued in birthday songs in Spanish! Lastly, we came as a group of 7, including 3 children and this place is so KIDS friendly. The kids had great food and also had a blast with the music. Being from NY, I can appreciate the service and excellent traditional Venezuelan food. Kudos to Arepera, Max and his team!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here again while visiting Montreal. The first time left us wanting more. We came here for Sunday brunch and we where happy we did. 

Eats:
- eats 4 cheese and 4 meat arepa. Wow!!! If I wasn't full after the first arepa I would have gotten another one. As it states the arepa is stuffed with 4 cheeses and 4 meats (pork, chicken, pulled meat and something) delicious
- breakfast brunch dish with plantains, beans, scrambled eggs, yuka. Very delicious. 
- chicken soup tasted like it was home made fresh from water. Delicious. I should have ordered a large bowl.

{"text":"First day in Montréal and my local friend takes me to this cozy and absolutely affordable little Venezuelan restaurant where you write your name on a list to wait for a table. (We waited for around 20minutes) 

I had there number 1, Carne Mechada/ shredded beef in tomato sauce... It was mouth wateringly good..... The beef was hearty and tender. And for $3, there juices are also quite interesting and refreshing. 

And although super busy, the staff were super friendly and attentive and never failed to top up our water on a hot summer evening.

A great 1st stop to our adventures in Montréal.

Just thinking about the food last night.... J'en ai l'eau à la bouche :9"}
{"text":"Awesomeness all around! I don't need to rewrite all the rave reviews all over again, you can see them below. Just try it!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant.

the staff is amazing! always so nice and even better. th food! the food is so good with such an authentic fear to it! they really care about the customer as well as the food they deliver. the atmosphere is family-esque but they definitely give you room to breath and hang out with your friends. Definitely reccomend 10/10 (for a while I went very day haha)"}
{"text":"I got the beef arepa with cheese, beef, black beans and plantains. The sandwich was good don't get me wrong, however I feel like it is very overhyped on yelp. The plantains paired with the salty beef created a nice savory/ sweet combo, however I found that the cheese overpowered the taste. In addition, I did not find the sauces to be flavorful at all; the avocado sauce was very meh and the hot sauce was not spicy to me at all!  

The service was great however, and our waiter was very warm and friendly. Also I was told that the restaurant is moving to the intersection of Prince Arthur and Colonial starting January 1, 2018."}
{"text":"After an evening of shopping on the Main, my husband took me to this place because i kept on talking about it. First time here and it was good! Cute family run restaurant with unpretentious vibes. 

We ordered the chicken soup, the empanadas, a beef arepas, a chicken arepas, a guava juice and a tamarind juice. Everything was delicious! 

A few notes though. Even though a lot of the critics said this place to be inexpensive, i find some dishes not worth the price. True, the arepas are very inexpensive. One was more then enough for my husband and i could barely get to the halfway mark. The appetizers are what i find not worth it. We ordered the chicken soup. It was like grandma's chicken soup! With a few pieces of chicken, potatoes and the broth was very flavourful! Not worth 5$!!! We also got a mix of empanadas. It comes in threes for 6$. When it got to our table, we were surprised at how little they were. Two small bites each empanadas! Tasty but not worth 6$. The arepas were very filling and good! Service is nice too. 

I would definitely return for the arepas but will skip the appetizers ;)"}
{"text":"Arepera has been a staple for me for years. Not only is the food fantastic but everything is gluten-free, they've got a ton of vegetarian and vegan options, and everything is super affordable.

I'm also super happy to see them in their new space. While it's definitely not the same super cozy and charming space that their original spot off of Duluth was, it's really great that they have a heck of a lot more seats. I remember waiting outside in some really icy weather at their old place for a table- it was always worth it, but I'm stoked that there isn't that issue anymore. Happily they've replicated the same design elements from their first location: the fake brick, the bright walls, the big celebrity caricature paintings- it's nice to see they didn't go full fancy with the space upgrade. Also, the menu prices have stayed the same. Yay! Go Arepera!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with amazing food and juice (especially the lulo juice).
The prices are more than ok"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to eat at this restaurant during our vacation. We ordered two arepas which came with  a green sauce and a hot sauce which were amazing. The service was great as well. The food tasted very authentic and homemade and would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Cute and homie restaurant. They offer a variety of sandwiches. My friend had the beef sandwich and I had the avocado sandwich. I can say that it was the best avocado sandwich I ever had. Fresh, tasty and generous. Even if you are not vegetarian, you won't be disappointed! We also had the fries which were good."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with a group of friends and it did not disappoint. We spent the weekend at Montreal and this was the first restaurant we had to wait on line for. We waited a good 20-30 minutes for a table. It is a very small restaurant and probably would not recommend for large groups. 

The menu is simple. 75% of it is all arepas. You pick either a vegetable, chicken, pork, beef or fish and it came with a side salad with avocado dressing. I had the pernil arepa and it was DELICIOUS. It doesn't look like much but it was packed with flavor. The hot sauce and avocado sauce was also a great complement as well.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place for four years before finally getting around to trying it. The staff are as good as the food at this small authentic Venezuelan restaurant! We started with plantains with cheese and avocado sauce--to-die-for. For mains, we went halvsies on #4 and #10. Both were excellent and served with a delicious bowl of greens."}
