{"text":"New-ish deli-ish place at JW Marriott. They use Boar's Head meats so i was up for trying it out. Ordering my \"build your own\" was a bit challenging because she was slow and unsure on the register.  My first issue was with the chibatta roll, which was heavy, bland, and lacking in proper texture. The amount of turkey and cheese was fair, but i got one tiny piece of wilted lettuce that only covered half the sammie. Same with the mayo - it was super light and only in the center.  Maybe another visit would be different (i would choose a different bread tho), but my simple sammie was $10 + tax, so I'd rather go elsewhere.  It did come with a delicious Boar's pickle, and a very small side of potato salad...just so-so. You can also choose macaroni or cole slaw.  They also have a lot sweets here (many fancy looking).. if you're into that."}
{"text":"Shared a pastrami Ruben and fries.   The pastrami was salty.  It was lean and juicy but salty.   The fries were good.  Sandwich was large and basket of fries was large.  Not sure what happened to the slaw.   The 1/2 full tiny tiny cup of Cole slaw was good but gone with two bites. There was no potato pancakes or other items in regular deli.   They did have chicken fingers, burgers, and wings.  Therefore, I would consider this more of a corner store or bowling alley deli, then an authentic New York deli.  Pepsi was $3 each.  For 2 people sharing 1 sandwich, one basket of fries and 2 sodas bill the bill was $26.   Not horrible but not as cheap as the bowling alley.  The baked items looked good but did not try.   Next time."}
{"text":"When this Deli first opened, it was way too pricey but then they closed to do some additional improvements and one improvement was adjusting the menu prices so I decided to try it.  SO glad I did!  Had the meatball sandwich and it was outstanding and the portion that was generous.  It came with a small container of salad choice (mac, potato or slaw).  I will definitely eat there again.  They have a beautiful display of pastries that I am told are all made in-house."}
{"text":"Not one of my favorite, pricing high, staff is helpful and attentive, sandwich was dry, let's say it needed something,I had the corn beef brisket reuben).. Nothing like the ones at Carnegie on the strip. I would only use my freebie, I would not go out of my way to pay for one..."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Ciabatta breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon & provolone. You'll thank me later! I also had the footlong chili dog, which didn't match the yummyness of the aforementioned. The bun was toasted though, so points for effort. No onions, though the menu lists that on the chili dog. Should have checked before I left.  The Italian sausage was so-so. Nothing memorable about it.   The deli space is open and decorated with a modern flair, and TVs. There were never more than a handful of customers when I've been there. Probably because the prices are too high. Most of them are, anyway. $12 for a sandwich is a little steep in this casino, in my opinion.  They have a nice selection of pastries and such in addition to the sandwiches, salads and sides. Alcoholic beverages are also available. Not a bad place to grab a bagel or a meal."}
