{"text":"Driving up, I thought, \"Wow, pretty dive-y.\" Walking in, I saw how tiny the place was -- it can fit maybe 20 people tops. But, checking out the menu, I saw how cheap their prices were. The waitress came out, got me seated, and took my order in short order. Soon after, chips and house-made salsa came out. Then, my $6 plate of three carne asada street tacos with rice and beans followed shortly thereafter. The food was good, but not spectacular. In all, quick service, good food, and cheap prices. I'd recommend it for anyone in the area looking for a quick lunch at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"SIX stars for Irma's!! An incredible hidden gem with generous portions at fabulous prices! We were famished after an early flight from NYC, and Irma and her attentive staff took excellent care of us. (Ask them for recommendations; you will not be disappointed!) The food is special--it's all so flavorful you can tell Irma cooks everything with lots of love and care. Shout-out to the red chile pork ribs, veggie burrito, chilaquiles breakfast burrito, caldo de pollo, and cream of shrimp soup! Also the lemonade & jamaica (pronounced \"ha-my-ca,\" not like the island) is so refreshing and floral. Totally worth squeezing into the parking lot and cozy dining area. Already planning our next meal back here!"}
{"text":"Came to Irma's for breakfast with the family.  Non-local here .... from San Diego, CA.  We know good mexican food and Irma's did NOT disappoint.  

Irma is a really nice older lady who treats you like family and makes you feel like you are eating at home.  

I ordered the Chorizo and Eggs (OUTSTANDING!).   My wife ordered the breakfast burrito.  The kids got the pancakes, eggs, and bacon.  Everything was delicious.

Not only was the food spot on and portions good sized .... it was also extremely reasonable.  Where else can you find breakfast for $3.99?  Are you kidding me?  She should be charging closer to $6.99 - $7.99 for the plates.

Give this place a try and support your local small business!"}
{"text":"Great food and incredibly friendly staff/owners who treated us like family and let my son try many options until he found what he wanted. 
Simple settings but food was great with large portions for relatively low prices. Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Awesome down home cooking! I used to frequent Mexico often, so I know good Mexican food. Trust me, this is the place! Have not had anything I didn't like here, and I have tasted most of the menu. Small place, but well worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's right here in our historic hood! Home cooking by wonderful Irma and attentive service by Julio. While we ordered just 3 tacos it came with delicious yellow rice and smooth refried beans, ripe fruit and some salad veggies, beautifully presented. As a special treat Irma let us try us try her \"homemade green juice\" that mixes veggies, oatmeal and lemon for a refreshing chaser. Go visit and enjoy! Sandy and Robin in Fairview Place"}
{"text":"Found this place while here for work. Best way to end the trip. Super welcoming staff. Irma even made custom orders from items not even listed on menu.  This place is a real treat. Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Big portions little prices and a little owner with a big heart. Comforts of casa all in one place. Love it"}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning because I heard they had great Chilaquiles.  That was an understatement.  I felt like I was back in Mexico.  By far some of the best food I've had in a long while..."}
{"text":"First time visit and extremely satisfied.  Had the pleasure of meeting Irma this morning - she was our cook and server and extremely friendly and gracious; Irma is absolutely adorable! 

Irma provided us excellent service - she adds special touches such as bringing a pitcher of water w/sliced oranges and lemons instead of just bringing a glass of water; she also shared with us her special extra hot salsa which was very tasty - and yes spicy! 

We ordered the green chilaquiles/egg and the steak picado/egg; both dishes were delicious and portions are large - the flour tortillas were freshly made.  The prices are amazing - most dishes range from $4 to $6.

I will definitely come back to Irma's Kitchen next time I am in town.  

Thank you Irma for your amazing Mexican cooking!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, had the ground beef tostadas. Very good quality of food and even better price. My friends had the breakfast burrito and chilaquiles. They were very happy with their choices. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So excited this place is open! Just a short walk for those of us that live grand.

Super sweet ladies, yummy food, super reasonably priced.

Food is home cooked, just like my grandma makes. Chili is yum, fruit on each plate is a special touch.  

We love it!"}
{"text":"Love the food... if you stop by over there ask for the loca lemonade but it does have a spicy kick but it is worth it..... ask for this ask for waitress named Amada, she funny and so sweet ..."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to say enough good things about this place. After traveling from Texas to Phoenix, my friend and I were looking for some breakfast. This place popped up nearby on Yelp. We thought we would give it a try and I'm so glad we did. We walked in and were greeted by a very nice lady. This is clearly a favorite spot of the locals as many of them knew the names of everyone working there. The menu is painted on the wall and everything sounded delicious. We ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. It tasted great and was served with very hot and very, very fresh tortillas. Not only was this the best meal and service we've had all trip, it's the best I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service is very good very low prices... All the employees have smiling faces :-)   here you will see several"}
{"text":"Awesome delicious homemade food & sauces. Family friendly prices. Now you can afford to take entire family out to eat fresh & healthy food, and not dent the family budget! Fast & friendly staff eager to help or explain menu items & specials of the day. A must go to on my favorite restaurant list."}
{"text":"This place is Always delicious and 
their servers are so nice and friendly.
Why don't you just  go and try."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in the valley... wonderful and personable service and the carne asada is on point. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito as well."}
{"text":"I love this place .. The tacos are delicious.. The staff is wonderful .. Very friendly and pleasant ... The food comes to the table very quickly ...They also cater and I'm considering them for a party in October .. Love you guys ..Keep up the great service ...."}
{"text":"The Best Traditional Mexican food that I have had in 30 years. My grandpa owned a traditional family style Mexican restaurant when I was a kid and I have not had such great food and favors since then. I've asked around trying to find a great Mexican restaurant and no one really knows of any which seems strange to me.  No longer will I search my stomach has found a home for amazing Mexican food. I'm here to stay!"}
{"text":"Don't let the look of the restaurant dissuade you! It almost did for us, but we are very glad we tried it. Some of the best Mexican food we have ever had. Perfect portions, and very tasty. Very friendly staff as well. Definitely must visit this place if you want good authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"great chorizo and potato tacos for breakfast. the carne asada, rice and bean combo for lunch was good!"}
{"text":"Awesome, gritty, authentic. Got the chicken burrito. On point. Tried the breakfast burrito as well and was great. Breakfast lunch dinner all day!"}
{"text":"So good! HAVE THE CHILAQUILES! Bomb af and they hooked it up with a side of mashed potatoes cuz thanksgiving is coming up! And they were bomb too! So nice and you can tell they have regulars coming in everyday."}
{"text":"EASILY the best veggie burrito in Phoenix!! As a vegetarian living in midtown Irma's has become my one stop shop for a nutritious green juice and a veggie burrito (with more ingredients than the typical beans, rice, and lettuce). Prices are unbeatable! Make sure to get there before 4pm."}
{"text":"So happy to see you guys getting great reviews!!! Such a good place.... I will make it back soon"}
{"text":"Go.
Are you still reading?
Just go.
It will be the best filled you have eaten in a very long time.
My wife is a carnivore. I'm a vegetarian. They have tons of choices for both. 
They feed the homeless.
Family owned.
The food is awesome, hot, and plated up so attractively you may think you are at fine dining.

The price is so affordable.

I left happy, full, and with money still in my pocket!!!"}
{"text":"Very awesome hole-in-the-wall joint! The selection is small but delicious. All dishes come with free chips and salsa, drinks with refills. A person can easily have breakfast or lunch for under $10, incl. the tip. Irma has become one of my new standbys when on the Westside."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Las Vegas and needed somewhere to stop to get a late breakfast/lunch and yelp recommended here so we stopped by. What a great choice.
From the moment we arrived we were greeted warmly and allowed to sit where we want. Though it wasn't that big and spacious in the place it wasn't cramped either. We were given tortilla chips and nachos whilst we decided what to order and the salsa which came with them were to die for.
We looked through the menu and were shocked at how cheap everything was and wrongly assumed it would be small portions which it wasn't.  I got three tacos which were fantastic and the rice and beans on the side were just as good.  My girlfriend ordered the Mexican meatball soup and loved it as much as I loved my tacos. Everything was flavoured perfectly and the hint of mint in the meatballs made everything really light and fresh tasting. 
I got a burrito to go since everything was so good and that was my only slight downfall of the place. The burrito was very small and didn't contain much filling meaning the tortilla had been double wrapped and the whole thing tasted a bit doughy. 
Other than that we loved it to bits and would come back every time we were in Phoenix. What a wonderful little place."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant anywhere; will be coming here daily during my stay. Unpretentious mom-and-pop place where people care about the food they make. If you're a vegetarian, ask for veggie options; they'll offer stuff that's not on the menu. I didn't know a veggie burrito can be this good - and I'm from New York City where there's Mexican food on every block."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. The service was beyond amazing. The caldo de pollo was great! And tortillas were delicious and homemade"}
{"text":"Excellent prices, personal service by Irma and her daughter, locally owned, tasty food.  What's not to like?

The place IS small, maybe 6-7 tables inside and 3 tables outside.  That adds to the charm."}
{"text":"Was referred to by a friend, they said not fancy but will not dissapoint! Omgggggggg I am a customer for life! I had the chilaquiles special, chilaquiles Christmas (half red/ half green) with 2 sunny side eggs on top, rice and beans, a piece of carne asada (thin steak) and a salad for $5.99  and if that wasn't enough Irma herself came to see if we were pleased, what a wonderful hard working lady! This is the kind of food my mom or aunts would make, very home like meal amazing"}
{"text":"As many other reviewers have said, Irma's offers friendly servixe and home-made Mexican fare that sticks to your ribs a d makes you feel warm all over like when you think about your Mom and believe for a moment that she is not disappointed about your lack of accomplishments and your disastrous marriage.

If you are in town, definitely stop in and get your Mex on."}
{"text":"Fabulous, delicious home-style cooking. I had the chicken soup, which was prepared like a classic caldo with enormous chunks of fresh chicken and vegetables. One of the best and healthiest meals I've had in a restaurant in a long time (ever?)

The meal came with two delicious salsas, high-quality chips, and excellent tortillas. But perhaps the best part was a small bowl of lentil soup that I was given before the meal. It was fabulous, and such a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"If you've not been here, get here! Irma is adorable, the food is fantastic and the price is beyond a bargain! It's a small place with not a lot of seating so be prepared to take it to go-but if you do get a chance to sit and eat, be prepared to be treated with amazing service AND like one of the family.  THANK YOU IRMA!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome, I had to write a review. Food is extremely tasty and service is spectacular! Delicious, fresh, authentic, and inexpensive. Irma's Kitchen is a mother and daughter operated business with an open kitchen concept. This place can get a little busy around lunch, but I never waited more than 10 minutes from entering the establishment to chow time. Everything here is pretty freaking delicious. Start out with the tacos or burritos. I highly recommend the carne asada or picado steak over the chicken. Irma's is bound to explode with business in the near future, so you might as well get a piece before the lines get ridiculous. Irma, you are amazing!"}
{"text":"Although the menu doesn't reflect it, they will make lots of vegetarian items. All of the food was plentiful & tasty and the owner was friendly. Very simple, inexpensive place. Bars on the windows and outside atmosphere a bit impoverished. My husband didn't feel comfortable here but we were starved after a long flight my daughter & I had chosen it because of great reviews. Tablecloth wasn't clean and a few flies buzzing around. Possibly too authentic, if you know what I mean, for some tastes. They serve real Mexican Coke-which we appreciate-and they improvised easily for our vegetarian requests. We couldn't see a health department rating posted. Other reviews state the owners feed the homeless from the kitchen-a huge plus to our family. Plates, cups and silverware all appeared very clean."}
{"text":"I'm always greeted with a smile by the owner Irma whose children and grand children help her run this family Mexican restaurant. The food is consistently good, make with care and love."}
{"text":"After a 4 year Mexican food drought, this is exactly what I needed.  Barrio Cafe the night before, and IRMA's for breakfast..   Chorizo and eggs, oh soo ono flour tortillas, fresh rice and beans.   What a great staff.  We were passing through with friends from Tokyo.. and they just loved it.   Muchas gracias.  Arigato.  Mahalo, and aloha plenty"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this little place because our typical Sunday breakfast place, Vovomeena, was packed. We decided to hop on yelp and saw this place pop up nearby. It's not much from the outside but don't let it deter you from going inside. The people are so warm and friendly! This is a mom and pop small business and they are just getting started but the food was very good. We ordered the breakfast burrito and chilaquiles and they were both delicious. I like my chilaquiles spicier so if you want more fire make sure to ask. The salsas that came out with the chips had a great kick. The menu was simple and had 5 or 6 things listed for breakfast, lunch and dinner which made deciding a lot easier. I then made my way across the street to treehouse bakery for a cookie. Great little location."}
{"text":"Amazing little neighborhood restaurant.  Food is delicious and Irma is the friendliest and most hard working person that I know!  She's always there with a smile on her face and serving her wonderful Mexican fare.  If you haven't been there, you're missing out on the best Mexican food in the valley, bar none!  Don't walk, run to Irma's!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny little dinner.   Food was good.  We will be coming back. Prices are affordable."}
{"text":"I walked over a mile and  it was worth every step. I had a breakfast burrito which was stuffed with bacon, chorizo eggs and potatoes. Smothered in green and red Chile. Her green is very spicy and VERY good. I am leaving so full and so happy. Sabroso!"}
{"text":"Nice hearty Breakfast burrito one of the best in town fresh bacon egg potatoes and cheese. Service was top notch. Hot fresh coffee. In a quiet downtown neighborhood. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh my yum!! Was looking for a quick meal before our flight. It's close to the airport, got great yelp reviews, so we tried it. Came in at 1130am,  ordered breakfast burritos (can get them anytime!!) And was given complimentary chips and salsas while we waited. Red is really tasty, green is a bit more spicy. The seasoned potatoes in the burrito were perfect. and I swear the horchata was more creamy than back home (Chicago). Thanks for the great suggestions here!! Stop reading and just go there!!"}
{"text":"This place lived up to its reviews and is truly one of the best culinary gems I've found in Maricopa County. This wholesome family cafe came here from the past in a time machine to serve up wonderfully homestyle Mexican food with love and soul at incredibly low prices. Yeah, the neighborhood is seedy, but the restaurant is clean and inviting with very sweet waiters. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and \"Yelped\" good pancakes. Irma's kitchen came up! For starters, my grandmother's name is Irma so I had to give it a try. 
I stopped in around 11ish, by noon it was packed, people coming and going. It's a really small place, about 6 or 7 small tables. 

I ordered the American breakfast .... skillet pancakes, bacon, eggs and orange slices. The pancakes were huge and thick with a hint of sweetness, definitely old fashioned. I'm going to give Irma's kitchen a try again but next time I'm trying Mexican food. Everybody, everybody ordered Mexican food."}
{"text":"So, this place looks like a total dump from the outside but you'd be silly to let this dieter you from coming in. If you are looking for a good quick bite at a very very reasonable price this is your spot! 

The menu is a bit on the smaller side but that's okay, they make up for it in the size of the portions. The young woman who seems to be the owner is VERY sweet and is super friendly! She seems to be the only one ever working but she does a great job at keeping up with the customers and kitchen staff.

I've tried the albondigas soup, tortilla salad, burritos, etc... everything has been surprisingly great! My only critique would be that the chicken used in the taco salad is so juicy that it actually makes the taco bowl soggy. Besides that everything including their homemade chips and salsa is great! 

The inside is a little small so if you go with more than two people be prepared to be seated super close to the next table! 

All in all I really like this place and will continue to support this small local business"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentleman, you don't have to cross the border anymore or worry about Trump building a wall... Just go to Irmas."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! First timer! Food was wonderful and the service and staff were beyond friendly. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. One of our favorites. Go try them out. They have a very friendly staff and my wife and I always try their daily specials. Haven't had a bad one yet"}
{"text":"This is a lovely small place with a homey feeling!!! The food was amazing;The food reminded me of my grandmothers back in Mexico! Customer service was fantastic, Ms.Irma herself came out to see how we were all doing. Totally recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Irma and her daughter are delightful and their tiny restaurant has the best food I've had in years! For me, four stars is great, but Irma gets my full five stars because it's better than the rest."}
{"text":"This is place very great flavor. Server was on top of things and everything that we ask for it was brought to us. Chips and salsa given at the beginning of the meal had a great flavor as well. The bread with the menudo was toasted and a spread of butter which gave it a home flavor. I would gladly recommend this place. I was going to give 4 stars instead of  5 stars because the Coke Zero had expired but was gladly replaced with a new one. No questions asked. Great service!"}
{"text":"Irma's Kitchen is the real deal - authentic Mexican food (and vegetarian friendly!), great service, ridiculously affordable prices, beautiful presentation and ample portions, and the famed gigantic \"mean green\" juice. This place is family run, has absolute no pretense, and has fresh delicious food - what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Well all of these other yelpers are right on the money with this little place!  So I haven't been feeling so hot lately, and was seeking a good clear broth chicken soup. A buddy of mine told me that I need to go check out Irma's kitchen on 15th Ave!  First of all you can't get scared to go in, because of the neighborhood, and if you have to park on Garfield street and walk over to Irma's just do it.  Lots of times the best places are small and not in the best area's!  All I can say is there's lot of Love coming out of this Kitchen!  Everyone is so friendly, and when I say this is small, I mean maybe 16 people max can sit in here at one time!  The salsa is wonderful.  The Chicken Soup I was served today was probably the best I've ever had, and the rice is perfection!  I'll definitely be back and will tell my foodie friends who I know will love this place!  Prices are extremely cheap for this quality of food and service!  I'm so glad I went here today!  Just a very special little place that reminds me of eating at my Grandma's house as a kid, and she could seriously cook.  If you can relate to that, then by all means come here!  These are good people, that cook with Love and genuinely appreciate their customers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada burrito and it contained a 90% mix of rice and beans and then the carne asada was mixed with a sauce that was watered down. I ate a quarter if the burrito and then stopped by another place alongside of the i17 to get banh mi. They were very nice and the Jamaica was fresh but i will not go there again."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, and wonderful wonderful service. Only in the city for one night but sure gonna go there for breakfast before I leave!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The staff (Amanda and Irma) are the best. Crazy personable and amazing! Def have to check this place out. Oh and the prices are insanely cheap! Like $11 for two plates of food."}
{"text":"I had the chilaquiles with green chili sauce and my God hands down best food ever! They serve breakfast all day the chips are fresh the food is delicious and the service is exceptional! You can feel the love as soon as you walk in!!! I was so surprised but I am so glad we went to eat! I recommend to Anyone feeling home sick or wanting some real home feel like food! My family and I felt so at home I asked to stay their lol!!! Thanks Irma"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican!! Family owned and the service was superb! We got their burritos and soup and the quality was 5 stars. Highly recommend and will visit again when we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews we decided to come and see how true they might be. I can honestly tell you we were beyond happy and satisfied after our experience and all the great reviews are 100% true. 
 Although we wanted to try everything we managed (somehow) to narrowed it down to carne asada tacos, the tampiquena and cheese quesadilla. Both were outstandingly delicouse. The chili rellenos that came with the tampiquenas were the best I've ever had. 
And I shouldn't forget to mention the free chips and salsa which were fresh and a great starter to your meal. 
So in conclusion-It's clean, service is great and the food is outstanding.  All the right ingredients for a solid 5 star review. 
We will be back for sure on first Friday and again anytime we are in the area. It's so worth it for a place that makes you feel happier then you did before coming in."}
{"text":"This is a really great place.  The food is good, the people are friendly, and it is so affordable.  It's definitely a restaurant worth trying."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican Breakfast. You gotta try the eggs and chorizo. Beans are awesome. It takes a lot for me to recommend a Mexican restaurant. Irma was the best. 

Gracias Irma por todo."}
{"text":"First time here this morning based on all the good reviews. I got a breakfast burrito with bacon, and a friend of mine got a breakfast burrito with steak instead of bacon. Both were phenomenal. Let's just say I have had a lot of breakfast burritos in my lifetime. This one did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Okay, just finished early dinner here based on the sky high ratings on Yelp, plus there aren't a ton of restaurants near my hotel. The glowing reviews are well deserved. Irma's is a very small restaurant with maybe 4 or 5 small tables (4 tops at most). It's kind of the picture of a mom and pop, Mexican version and Irma is the cook with I assume a young family member running the counter

The salsa that comes with fresh chips is different from any other I've had, it almost looks like chicken soup, yellowish, clear and very flavorful. I had the chicken fajitas, which came with a giant flour tortilla that was as hot as hades. The chicken breast pieces (not cheaper thigh meat) were large and perfectly cooked through yet juicy and tender. Squash, onions and peppers add to the fajita mix.

Rice and refried beans and an apple slice with grapefruit slice on shredded lettuce fill out the plate. I was stuffed when I finished and there was no way I was going to leave anything this good on the plate! All that and a refillable fountain soda for less than $10.00.

Support a really nice if little neighborhood restaurant if you're in Phoenix, and go to Irma's."}
{"text":"I have never had a more delicious breakfast burrito in my entire life. I will be back to try every damn item on their menu. Quality. Heaven. And the people who work there are so sweet. They gave out free pastries and gave my daughter organic grape juice for free! Such a nice family."}
{"text":"Lovely little whole in the wall off the highway! Very authentic, friendly, attentive staff, and delicious food. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I called for an order of 20 burritos and they only heard 4 of them. They quickly apologized and made my order quickly and offered me beverages while I waited. Very kind staff. Will return!"}
{"text":"Irma is wonderful,  always a smile. Awesome  breakfast ."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, but standard fare in terms of Mexican. Small and intimate environment is good."}
{"text":"I decided to get breakfast burritos for my team,  and this place had great reviews so I gave them a call to see what options they had. 
From the beginning Irma was super helpful,  she let me order ahead, so this morning I just stopped by to get all my burritos, with tons of salsas and even some chips. 
Everyone LOVED the food,  the prices and I couldn't have had a better service. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot after a coworker raved about it. 
Sadly enough, I was disappointed in my selection. 
First off let's start with the what we each got. We ordered to go. I got the three taco plate which includes rice and beans. Taco selection was Carne Asada. Decent nothing other fast food joints cook up. Beans tasted like canned beans. Rice was also bland. Coworker got the Mexican pizza which looked good. Decent. Smelt good when we got there I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong thing to try.  Was going to give them another shot however after tasting the food. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here Sunday morning and had one of best meals I have had in a long time.   The service,  food and price can't be matched in the area.   Parking is limited but Sunday morning is a good time to come by."}
{"text":"After patronizing this restaurant for several months and trying so many dishes, especially the daily specials, I finally got to try their menudo today and it was outstanding. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant that we found on Yelp. It's a smaller place but it is really quaint. Even though it's a small restaurant they can still seat a bunch of people in there. It feels like a place you can come and enjoy a peaceful meal. They have a straight forward menu that's easy to understand. 

The service was great! Employees were really nice and courteous. They do a good job in making sure we were taken care of during our stay. Our food came out quickly and tasted great!

They have a small parking lot. If it is full then you need to go park down the next street in front of the houses.

Overall, I was impressed by the speed, service and the taste of the food. I recommend everyone to try this place out if you are in the area. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through Yelp and was excited because it was rated 5 stars. I was very disappointed. I went with my family and we ordered a red chili burrito, chorizo and eggs, chilaquilas with eggs and the steak picado. You won't pay a lot . But the chili was tart, I've never used tart to talk about Mexican chili. The chorizo and eggs were more eggs than chorizo. The red burro was ok. The steak picado was diced very fine and had bits of tough meat. Again, the food is cheap, but the taste just isn't there."}
{"text":"This place was so good. I have heard great things so I had to try it. I am so glad I did because the food was amazing and  very reasonably priced.  This staff was also so nice and accommodating as well. This is definitely at the top of my list . It is so hard to find a good mexican breakfast place and this will be my go to spot.  Keep up the good work Irma"}
{"text":"Before I delve any further, here's what I'll be conveying in this review.  5 stars for the food.  1 star for the dining experience.  Depending on how you weigh those two things, you may come up with a different number of stars than I did.  And how you define the \"dining experience\" can of course be wide open to interpretation.  But I'll give you the full rundown on my experience and you can judge for yourself.  But just to reiterate, the food itself is awesome and a great value, so much of what I'll be sharing will echo some of the earlier Yelp reviews of Irma's.

I came here on a Sunday morning, excited by what the Yelpers were saying about this place (particularly for breakfast).  Its a tiny space (room for maybe 20 inside and 4 outside) with a tiny amount of parking (maybe 4-5 spots).  When I arrived around 8:30am the place was fairly busy, but I was able to get a small table for myself.  The young man working the front (didn't catch his name) was super courteous and took my drink order not long after I arrived (I asked for a horchata) and gave me a complimentary chips and salsa.  For whatever reason it took about 5 minutes for him to bring out my drink order.  During that time was when things got dicey.  The place is small which means if you're dining inside you're right next to the kitchen itself.  And from the time I arrived to the time I got my drink the kitchen got super smokey, to the point where the smoke was literally billowing out into the dining area.  By the time I got my horchata (which was delicious by the way), I was almost choking on the smoke.  Two customers moved to the outside tables to escape the smoke and I was about to follow suit when the head cook finally opened the windows to air out the building.  About 5 minutes later, the air was breathable again.  Nevertheless, the restaurant remained smokey (though at least tolerably so from then on), which makes me wonder what they'll do in the summer when its too hot to pop open a window or sit outside.  Yikes.  Bottomline, if you're coming here for the first time, my recommendation would be to play it safe and sit outside (if its cool enough) or get your order to go.  At least until they figure out how to solve the borderline dangerous air circulation problem here.

Now then, let's get to the good part.  The food.  Based on the food photos and the prices here I had assumed that I would need to order two dishes just to come away full and happy from this place.  After all, there can't possibly be that much food on a plate for just $4, right?  I decided to go with an order of chilaquiles (Christmas style) and a breakfast burrito.  Total cost for the food, horchata, free chips and salsa, tax and tip came to about $13.  For that cheap, I expected a pair of dishes light on portions.  

Whoops.  The breakfast burrito was huge and stuffed with eggs, bacon and potatoes.  I added a little hot sauce to boot.  This alone would've left me plenty satisfied.  But a few seconds later, out came a big plate of chilaquiles (basically fried tortilla strips covered in red or green sauce, or both in my case) with eggs your way (I got scrambled), rice, beans, and lettuce.  It wasn't too spicy, but great flavors all around with just a little kick.  There was no way I was gonna finish it all and I happily took some home to finish at lunch.  And all that for just $13?  Ridiculously good deal.

So there it is.  Great food and drink.  Great value.  The restaurant itself?  That leaves much to be desired.  Like I said, the young man who served me was courteous but slow and the air circulation was bad enough that I would not recommend dining inside.  If you're coming here for take out or to dine outside while the weather is good, please do.  But come summertime, takeout may be the only way to go here."}
{"text":"What an AMAZING place!!! About as hole in the wall as you can get; if you blink, you'll miss it. The inside is definitely cozy with about 6 or 7 tables crammed in there. You honestly do have a little bit of doubt when you first go in. You think, \"This place has a full 5 stars?\". And then the food comes.... I promise you, you will be blown away! I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was unlike anything I've ever had. And the chips and salsa! I went for lunch and wanted to go back for dinner that day. Now, great food is obviously a must for a great restaurant but what sets this place apart from the rest are the other things. First of all, the price. In a day and age where it seems like premium food is sold at a premium cost, Irma's kitchen challenges that notion! With a $4 tip, my meal of a burrito, Coke and chips and salsa (free) came out to $12; you can't beat that! On top of the price, the staff is priceless. I'm not sure if the lady working the counter was Irma herself or not but she was incredibly friendly. She was giving out free samples of a lemonade recipe she had created that included jalapeno peppers and it was unlike anything else I've ever had. She was always smiling and cheerful and sincerely happy that people were there. Please, do NOT judge this place by the location or how it looks because the food and people at Irma's is hard to beat ANYWHERE!"}
{"text":"Total gem of a restaurant. Great service and great food. Love this place will be my new go to Mexican in downtown."}
{"text":"I expected more in food quality and atmosphere. But they couldn't have been nicer people."}
{"text":"So I'm not too big in Mexican food especially not so early in the morning. but my boyfriend LOVES Mexican food. So when we saw this place that had both pancakes and Mexican food we jumped on it.

Let's start talking about the food first. I got the pancakes. He got the breakfast burrito, chicken soup. Irma came out with chips and salsa and they were HELLA good. You could taste the freshness of the tomatoes and the chips were perfectly crisp with a sprinkle of salt on top. My bf didn't take too long to finish it and Irma got him seconds. The chicken soup was also amazing, the chicken was tender and the broth was also very flavorful. I thought the burrito was amazing too but my bf thought it was a little too salty (I just think he was too full to enjoy it fully). I don't think I've ever wanted to praise a tortilla before. It was cheesy and every bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I think my American breakfast was ok, not too memorable. I would definitely go for the Mexican stuff next time we're here. Although I don't know when that'll be since we're not from here :(

The place is small and clean and you'll be greeted with a smile by Irma. There's a tv in the background that's not too loud. There was people coming in and Irma greeted everyone like family. Eating here just made me feel all fuzzy and warm. Probably how you feel when gma is making amazing food just for you. 

The price is ridiculously cheap. The total for us was about $16. We got three dishes and a coffee. Even with a generous tip that's less than $25. They also take card (they even take Amex). 

Give this place a try if you like Mexican food or even if you don't like Mexican food. You'll leave the place stuffed feeling all warm and fuzzy."}
{"text":"I grew up eating mexican food. This place is awesome with the best customer services and delicious meals. I ate chilaquiles and they tasted like my mom's so I felt like at home. Will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I can't ever stop coming here. Great service and great food! MMMM! I totally recommend this place. Prices are very descent and the taste of the food is just amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty small place , feels homey. Breakfast burritos are thick and cheap and delicious. I felt that the regular (carne Asada burritos are over priced for their size . $7-8"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHOENIX. 

5 tables in the whole place. Friendly staff. Personable staff!  But the food!!!!!!!  

I had the breakfast burrito - asked for chorizo instead of bacon. I downed it in 5 minutes flat!  

My boyfriend got the chilaquiles. It is beautiful when it comes out. Seasoned to perfection. The perfect pairing of extras on the plate. He gorged himself because he didn't want to leave anything behind it was so good!!!! 

The staff even came around to ask how everyone was enjoying the food. How sweet!  You have to try it."}
{"text":"Homemade Mexican food made with love!  Cant beat this little place.. Great Value! Irma and her son and staff are so friendly.  It is like eating with family.  We like to pick up breakfast burritos when we are in a rush.  My daughter also loves Irma's hot oatmeal!
Give this place a try - you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place just about every day. Finally stopped for lunch with my coworkers because of the Yelp reviews. Don't let the nondescript exterior fool you,  this place is a hidden gem. Food is great, salsa is out of this world. I'll be back there again."}
{"text":"It's a little warm so I would be considered about coming in the summer. The prices are great. It's very cute if you have out of town guests it's a good place to come. The food is great. The people that work at the restaurant are friendly helpful and really listen to what you want!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this original Roosevelt gem for the last 3 years and I'm just finally getting around to giving Irma's kitchen a well deserved review. It's family owned and the food is authentic. This food isn't greasy and they use quality ingredients. I recently had Irma's kitchen cater my dad's 70th birthday for 85 people and the food is what everyone gushed about at the party. Customer service is always great and the food is consistent. You're missing out if you're downtown and go anywhere else. Cheers"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been coming for the past three years and I finally thought to write a review. Very tasty Mexican food!!! I special order their veggie burrito with a little bit of beans, it's amazing! They also have a very good spicy salsa that I love. The place is always clean and has a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Downtown PHX. Breakfast burritos. Local. Tiny spot. What more can you say? A little off the beaten path but then again the grand area is turning into a nice locale. Nothing fancy here just everything you'd hope for when you're hankering for a breakfast burrito. 

Service was nice and hospitable too!"}
{"text":"Don't know how many times I passed this little gem while driving down 15th Avenue.  A consultant at work recommended it and I was like sure ok. My expectations was extremely low.  There is only a few tables but OMG the food is awesome.  The prices are much lower than what you would expect."}
{"text":"Went there after reading good reviews, and wasn't disappointed. The mother daughter team really take good care of you.  Food is pretty good and priced well. Over all good value for the money."}
{"text":"Was in the area and craving breakfast burritos. This place is such a hidden gem. Really good food, great prices, and really wonderful staff! Efficient and friendly. The place was busy at 9am."}
{"text":"Really quality food! I would absolutely come back especially with these prices. I was quite impressed with the yellow rice with veggies and my chimichanga was much better than your standard chimi!!"}
{"text":"delightful and delicious. try the fresh ginger and lime juice. friendly owners. all the food was great! worth a visit (or several)"}
{"text":"Ate here recently after seeing the photos above of nice fluffy pancakes. I could tell the one line cook in the back doing my order was new as he received constant instruction from the guy at the counter. I think he accidentally used tortilla mix, because the pancakes I received looked nothing like the one's depicted here from April 2015. They were flat and rubbery...like a nasty grey-ish, flavorless crepe. The whole crew was very friendly, though, so it's sad the food wasn't awesome."}
{"text":"When your friend tells you to a new place, you try it.  This was some good food. I literally felt like I was at my Nanas house for breakfast. Good food, great service, and amazing prices!!!!!  $9.70 total for our meal, can't beat that."}
{"text":":) my review after 2 months of hiatus and iam back! And my first place to go didn't disapoint! It just became one of favorite place to eat. This place has the best breakfast  burrito I ever have tasted. Miss Irma is so gracious and kind:) you can taste it from her food. Here's the 5 reason why this place should be supported.

1. Locally owned. Heart warming welcome when you get to the door.
2. Clean. Let me emphasize that, very clean. Just check their staff wearing gloves when they serve you:)
3. Price. That price. Check the pictures:) 3.99 for a burrito!
4. Presentation, for a small place their presentation is very impressive.
5. The flavor. Just come and try. 

Iam so sure youll like this place that iam willing to  pay your food if you don't like it. For Less than 5 bucks and you'll have a new place to eat.

:) the place is small and in a very hard to find. But I tell you. The trip to this place is worth it. 

Again less than 10 bucks for a great food. So great I am pretty sure you'll like it.


Update: brought my family back to taste Miss Irma's cooking. My mom said her beef soup is one of the best beef soup she tasted here, in the valley. That's a compliment that's hard to get. My Family also loved how Miss Irma always comes and say \"hi\" to their customers. This place  just made my family a believer of local small local businesses. Hope this place gets more attention;) 

Yelpers come and try their foods."}
{"text":"This place is so good the best service. The food was delicious cooked perfectly like nana or papì!!! And I had two left over boxes when my tab was only $12 and it wasn't because I didn't enjoy it... First time 5 stars for me but it was all around Amazing"}
{"text":"This is one of the best value and best tasting food I've ever tasted. This business is family owned and the chef is the mother who graciously greeted everybody at the dining table. Don't be fooled by the facade of this restaurant, the food's presentation and quality : 5 stars. I ordered the fish tacos. The refried bean is so smooth in texture and best of all not very salty and you could actually taste the inherent taste of the beans. The rice is so tasty and again salted just right that you could actually appreciate the taste of the rice and other ingredients added to it. The rice is cooked just right that it doesn't feel soggy or taste too salty. Best part are the fish tacos which are NOT fried, nor dry or hard to bite , the fish is tender and cooked just right and not loaded with salt. It's truly cooked with care. Whereas other restaurants load their dishes with salt or butter that's it's difficult to appreciate the actual taste of the ingredients, these dishes are perfectly cooked.  The other dishes like pancake or the salsa is ok.  Eggs are good a little undercooked but still taste really good. The staff are friendly and truly cares about giving good customer service. There's a family feel to it and the walls have written notes from visitors all over the world who visited this restaurant and liked it."}
{"text":"I was immediately suspicious of my friend when he suggested trying this place, as I think the location is sketchy. However, having now tried it, I will enthusiastically endorse it as one of my favorite \"hole in the wall\" restaurants for Mexican food. The inside of the restaurant is small, but clean. I had a carne asada burrito with rice and beans, and it was delicious, despite being really cheap. (The chips and salsa are free, too.) At the end of our meal, Irma herself came out and checked on us, which is a nice touch, in my opinion. All in all, a great find and something that will be added to my list of lunchtime restaurants."}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix, go to Irma's. Extremely reasonable prices for delicious, authentic Mexican food. The beans and tortillas are clearly homemade, and the tortas are phenomenal. My colleague and I opted for takeout, and while we were waiting for our food, one of the employees took a burrito and a bottle of water out to a homeless man in the parking lot. This warmed my heart, and was definitely not something you'd see at a chain restaurant.

Trust me. Just do it. Go to Irma's. Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were great! Best salsa I've had in Phoenix to date.  Friendly staff. Great food. Better believe I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I eat here on a weekly bases, it is very authentic Mexican food and Irma and her staff are so nice and friendly.  I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Irma's was the one bright spot to getting woken up before my alarm.

I have heard wonderful things about this place and I was finally able to get here before work. I got here just after opening and I was warmly greeted. The food was out quickly and I was constantly checked on to make sure I was doing alright.

The food was delicious, the salsa hot and the price more than fair.

If I ever am able to drag myself out of bed I'll be sure to stop at Irma's again."}
{"text":"Don't - Don't - Don't be put off by the location next to the body shop and the \"unpolished\" decor.  Having just spent 3 days in Sedona eating excellent food, this place topped them all.  And the service is wonderful as well.  Between the four of us, I and the other husband had the daily special, pork ribs in green sauce with rice and beans for $5.95.  This included two tortillas.  Ridiculous outrageous flavor with two super tender pork ribs. If my wife wasn't with me watching my diet, I would have ordered another order.  The other guy also said it was the best meal of the vacation.  Our meal for 4 people including 3 ice teas came to $24.  The Happiness Value for us was at least $10 per person so I gave the waitress $40.  The need to move and expand.  This is one of the most wonderful diners ever.  Honest!"}
{"text":"Pretty impressed. Great service and on fancy plates....what?? Sonoran hot dog was quality. Only reason for 4 stars is that they don't make their own chips!...por que no?"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I had the chili relleno with rice and beans. It was huge and delicious. The beans are creamy and the rice was the best I have tasted in a long time. The price was really low. With my soda less than six bucks. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The food was homemade, the service was excellent, they accommodated us with all our kids, and treated us so well! I absolutely loved my first visit! Our servers were incredibly courteous and helpful, they are the definition of customer service. I'm blown away by the price of the food, as the servings were HUGE and the food was SO GOOD! I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"THANK YOU, fellow Yelp-ers, for sending me to Irma's. Although the menu is somewhat limited (altering regularly and super fresh), the food itself is more authentic, delicious, prepared with abundant care, and surprisingly inexpensive. Moreover, the atmosphere is like a mini-trip to Mexico: the music and vibe setting the background, Irma herself is tending to the grill outdoors and everyone around her is more than just concerned with your happiness, but with making you feel like welcome long-lost relatives. Very rarely is the whole experience as worthy as the food, which is what you came for, and upon driving up, my friends were questioning my choice, but Irma's Kitchen is an UNEXPECTEDLY wonderful surprise - and we all want to go back and spend more time there. Definitely nothing like other restaurants, never mind Mexican restaurants - more like here are our Mexican cousins in Phoenix - we hope they like us enough to have us back."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in we knew we were going to love this place. From the delicious aroma of cooking food to the friendliest greeting ever! We felt at home. The chips and salsa were so yummy. Then on to the food. Yuummmmmm!!!! Tastes like homemade! So much flavor and made to perfection! And the prices are incredible. Thank you Irma for giving us a place we can't wait to come back to!"}
{"text":"This is supposed to be good Mexican food???   This is low quality crapola.  Go to Ritos if you are in the downtown area so your money isn't wasted."}
{"text":"The search for my go-to Mexican restaurant has finally ended! 

4 different kinds of salsa, all flavorful, spicy and not watered down. When you dine in, you get chips and all of these delicious salsas in fancy bowls.

We had the tamale plate with tacos, carne asada and chicken, and a bean & cheese burrito.

All of this was amazing minus the grizzle in the carne. The tamale sauce (red) was phenomenal and the tortillas were all very fresh so the beans didn't spill out of the burrito and the tacos remained intact. 

Dinner and lunch plates came with a pineapple and orange slice and shredded lettuce.

Our server, Irma's daughter was super sweet and very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's a good
In the wall with great food at cheap prices and the friendliest people ever!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service and outstanding food. Also, you can not beat the prices. Parking can be a challenge but it is well worth it. I've been here six times and I have yet to be disappointed. This place is phenomenal. 

Update: 1/27/18: this place deserves a best of nomination. The food and service just can't be beat."}
{"text":"Great prices! Guacamole had a great lime kick to it and was delicious. Salsa with chips were good. Beef tamale could have more beef to it but was good."}
{"text":"What a little gem in the desert. Looking for a good tasty place to eat while visiting Phoenix recently and found ourselves at Irmas, quaint very small location but super friendly people and delicious food loved every bite of it and I wish We had one back home in Houston. Irma even comes to every table checking on people , sweetest lady!!!! definitely try this place out. Killer Chilaquiles. Potent green sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The best chilaquiles in town! We will be coming back many times, and Irma is super sweet!!!"}
{"text":"Another delicious lunch! Had the #2 lunch special...homemade beef tamales enchilada style with rice and beans. Amazing!!

Another awesome lunch at Irma's!! Green tamale and beef flauta with those delicious rice and beans!!!"}
{"text":"This place excelled my expectations... Homemade from the chips and salsa down to the tortillas. The friendliest service I couldn't have asked for a better mothers day breakfast... Irma even brought the whole table a slice of cake no charge. I felt like family there thank you Irma's kitchen I will be back many more times!!!"}
{"text":"Price is amazing, food is decent, but the place is tiny(6 tables). Staff seemed nice the girl at the register is very nice and attentive, The owner however, did not check on our table even once. She asked everyone other table (6 tables) twice asking if they were okay and how was the food. She looked me dead in the eye and didn't say anything. Maybe it's just the fact I am obviously a lesbian? Who knows? Whatever the case, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Affordable prices, good chips and good service. The food left a lot to be desired so we won't be back. The ground beef carne asada chopped up...not quite the same thing. Still on a hunt for good ground beef tacos."}
{"text":"We drive a long way to try Irma's. I wouldn't do that again. It's a good little hole in the wall. Not great, not worth driving across the valley for,but solidly good. The salsa was really fresh. The enchiladas were to small, but the steak and eggs was way more than I could eat and the steak was nicely seasoned. If you're in the neighborhood, good spot."}
{"text":"Amazing place that makes you feel like you are in her home eating a home cooked meal. This place came highly recommended and I completely understand why. I recommend irmas to anyone that enjoys good food and great service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for a year now and we don't plan on stopping ever. Don't judge a book by it's cover here, it may not look like much on the outside but inside is the best staff who treats you like family and seriously cooks with love, fresh, top quality food and a welcoming atmosphere! BEST CHILAQUILES IN AZ HANDS DOWNNNN (the tortillas are homemade and poppin af too) !  Forever going to be a returning customer and forever referring to my friends and family! :)"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, like, REALLY authentic. DELICIOUS. I had the huevos rancheros and the sauce was the perfect amount of spicy. The horchata was literally the best I've ever tasted and I've had a lot, so for me to say that it really really is amazing. Irma even went up to my husband and I and asked how everything was!"}
{"text":"Wow, so glad we stumbled upon this amazing spot in our quick 36 hour trip to Phoenix. 
First thing we did after we landed and got our rental car was stop for breakfast here.

Echoing what everyone else has said - amazing food! 

I got the chorizo breakfast plate with corn tortillas and a horchata. My wife got the chilaquilles plate with green salsa. 

The starter chips were tasty. Their salsas are so flavorful! 

Our plates were hearty and delicious. Absolutely no complaints! 

Super affordable prices, cute little hole in the wall, good service, and amazing, authentic food. Would definitely come back when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Brilliant place, comfortable atmosphere, great smiling people and GREAT FOOD! These guys help my favorite group, which is Seeds for Autism, just across the street, which is just the cherry on the sundae. The menu is fantastic, especially the green chile burrito. The drinks are also great, this place will be a welcome treat this summer. Thank you. See you again very soon."}
{"text":"Must try this place, you would not regret!! Ive been in so many mexican food places and this place just my number 1 place i would love to come and recommend to everyone....

First of all, they are really clean and their food are very nicely presented. There food has so much flavor and really taste!! The price is really cheap for the food the food they serve...

The owner and the ppl who work this place are so nice.  The place is small but this place is mega clean!! The cleanest mexican place I've been to be exact."}
{"text":"Visiting from Tucson and found a little Mexican-American gem. My wife had the Chicken Mole dinner and she loved it! I had the Tampiqueño dinner and it too was outstanding. Never thought much of Chile Relleno but the one on my plate was delicious! Had the red Menudo and it was average, service was very good, Mrs. Irma came out to personally check with us and other patrons  on the quality. This little diner is so unassuming but big on flavors."}
{"text":"I would be fine with just the chips and rice but everything was fabulous! The service was fantastic and so was the food!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Phoenix and want some of the best authentic Mexican food you will ever have this is the place!
Super cheap and good portions of homemade deliciousness.  Try the Carne Asada Chile Relleno"}
{"text":"Honestly I expected it to be better my boy and went cause we saw the good reviews we weren't a fan of it IDK it was missing something so sad I can't remember exactly what we even ordered"}
{"text":"Awesome, chips & 2 kinds of salsa first. Both amazing! Shredded beef taco and a bowl of Caldo de res, super amazing. Loved it!! Pair it with your favorite Jalisco and you can't go wrong. First time here but everyone was nice, friendly and clean. What I normally order other places, love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. We had the breakfast burrito, chilaquiles, coffee and OJ and only paid 12 bucks! Free chips and salsa were yummy and Irma and our server (her son?) were so sweet. We will be back"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived down the street from this place for the last 6 yrs and never been here. Lo siento Irma... 
Very authentic, very tasty and a definite repeat. So close to home, I just wish they were open later, but I can adjust my schedule. I plan I tasting everything especially the menudo and caldo de res and breakfast."}
{"text":"irmas kitchen is a small little place but the service and food was unbelievable delicious will be back when passing through phoenix."}
{"text":"Only open for 8 days as of this writing, this is based on my first and only experience at Irma's Kitchen and it consisted solely of a generous sized breakfast burrito and a thoroughly pleasant hole in the wall dining experience. Don't take that negatively, Irma's is the kind of tiny, family run place that give's \"hole in the wall\"  a good name.   
  
A friendly greeting from Irma welcomed me to the tiny establishment, home of numerous previous eateries in same space near intersection of 15th Avenue, Grand and Roosevelt. The name is \"Irma's Kitchen\" although one of the exterior signs also says \"Irma's Mexican and American Food\".  The writing, as in the menu, is literally on the wall at Irma's.  The American part consisting of French toast and pancakes at breakfast, hamburgers, ham & cheese sandwiches, and I'm sure another item or two I missed but shouldn't have, considering the entire menu is painted quite neatly on the walls before me.

The curtained  windows and touch or two of simple wall decor give a personal touch and warmth to the dining area furnished with simple tables and chairs.  As to the food  I can only say my single ham & cheese & potato breakfast burrito, was truly best in class of similar tried at a good number of establishments, not dry, truly tasty, of generous size and quite filling, but not the overwhelming full-grown dachshund size burrito served at some establishments (which are fine, but just a bit too much and too heavy for my appetite and tastes most of the time).  If everything on the menu is as good, you can count this place as \"a find\".  And affordable?  As of this date, March 14, 2015, this cost a paltry $3.99+ tax. 

I look forward to going back and trying more of the writing on the wall, and at the prices listed, feel I can afford to. Next time you're on Grand for First Friday or having a sip at the Bikini Lounge and hunger strikes, try Irma's.They're open until 10 p.m., and I think you will find it an unpretentious, super-affordable and satisfying addition to the hood."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Small dining area, BUT there's additional seating in the back. Liked the chips and salsa, had double servings! I had flautas with guacamole and cheese, tasty! The owner Irma, came out and chatted with us at our table. Delightful woman, with an ambition and drive for life! Took down a few pointers from her ;) Also spoke to her daughter who has her mothers \"go getter\" attitude, they are soon to launch their own lemonade line! Definitely will be back to check out the lemonade!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly people! I think this is the best Mexican food I've ever had. I'll never visit Phoenix without eating at irmas!"}
{"text":"As my search for hole in the walls continue, Irma's Kitchen grabbed our attention when breakfast time came around.

all in all, it is A-Okay ... the people were very kind, the place was very humble and unassuming, prices are very good, but the food came too salty. We were on our way back to the airport, and just didn't have any more time to complain or anything else.

But all in all, not so bad ... maybe our experience was just a coincidence?"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST!! This charming neighborhood restaurant has the nicest staff and the most delicious food! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Such a great breakfast spot with great service! The food is amazing and has big portions you won't regret coming!"}
{"text":"Solid, cheap Mexican food. I got the taco plate and it was pretty legit. Came with beans, salad and rice so was very filling for $5.50!"}
{"text":"5$ gets you most breakfast and lunch plates here, and the food is amazing.  Service was great as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is hard to understate how nice the people are who run this place.  I know it sounds strange, but it really reminds me of going to Michelin 3 star restaurants where you are made to feel absolutely at home.  Yeah...its not fancy...but that's not the point.  The people are great and the food is real.

Last time I was there with a friend who ordered a smoothie.  The woman who made it came to greet us and tell us about it, how she drinks one of them every day and how much my friend would just love it.  She was so nice and excited about our order.  She must make dozens of smoothies a day but her sincere excitement told us that every one was special.  I had a taste..and it WAS great.

This is some of the best Mexican I have had.  Chile Rellenos are excellent as is the Chimichanga.  The pork rib special, which I haven't seen anywhere else, was also very good.  Mole looked good too...next time...."}
{"text":"I had this place the other day by accident and it was soooooooo good!!! I got the chilaquiles it was a good amount of food for 3.99! It was so authentic and yummy! Definitely one of my new favorite Mexican spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If I had to rate the service, it'd be a solid 5. The food itself gets a 2. It doesn't taste very homemade. Just meh. Wouldn't choose to go again."}
{"text":"Bean n Cheese to go.  Worth the effort to get here.  Service is fantastic.  Best in Phoenix!!

Can't wait to try other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing! Home cooked truly authentic Mexican food! Fall off the bone red chili ribs (special)... to die for! Excellent carne asada tacos! List goes on and on. Oh but Green chili is really picoso so be warned : P 
The service is as wonderful as the food. Irmas daughter treats every customer like a guest visiting their home, so hospitable & attentive! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to have breakfast in downtown Phoenix sometimes can be difficult especially with parking. Having breakfast at a Mexican food joint is not always a great idea since I feel like I will always be getting tacos and tortillas. However this was a much different experience. There's only five or six tables in the dining area.  Tv in the dining ares and we were able to watch the morning news in an intimate setting. The owners are super sweet very welcoming and I could tell they wanted to please.

I ordered the carne picada which came with rice beans a salad and eggs over easy. The steak was the best that I have ever had and a Mexican restaurant seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly as well. I asked her to not serve me rice and to give me extra salad since I'm doing the carb-free thing. She was very accommodating. 

My husband had the chilaquiles which he absolutely loves. I have tried it before and was not a fan but today when I tried it it was very good. The tortillas were crunchy in a green chile sauce that was a little bit spicy but very well seasoned. His plate was beautiful and so was mine.

 The one thing that I could say that I did not enjoy it was the coffee. It tasted like I was on an airplane which we all know is not very good. But considering that everything else was amazing that will not stop me from coming back here again. Next stop is to try them for lunch and for dinner their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Do NOT let the outside of this restaurant stop you from going inside. DO NOT! Three of us went inside for breakfast and were immediately met with a smiling waitress who showed us to our table. The place is small so you might have to wait during busy times, but let me tell you it is worth it.  Two of us had a Mexican breakfast and OH MY! It was delicious and plentiful.  Our other companion had pancakes and the portion filled up a 6 foot man. Looking around all we saw were happy faces and upon the walls people who were true fans wrote messages on the wall. The only reason why I had to deduct a star is because the coffee was pretty bland and typical for a fast food restaurant but not a place that served authentic food."}
{"text":"The service and food was impeccable! The gentleman who served us was super nice, cared deeply about his restaurant and experience - whether it was his menu, the salsas, how we were liking our food. It was fantastic. The pricing was also above and beyond. Super cheap and incredible breakfast burritos. Best I've had. Unlimited chips and freshly made salsa. We also got fresh green and red salsa as an option too. When I say fresh I mean made right there. Was an awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Irma's was a perfect place to stop in for your first meal in the south west. We had just arrived from the east coast on our way to Sedona and needed some authentic Mexican food and we sure found it here. The place is run by Irma, her daughter, and another helping hand, but all are the sweetest people in the world. Irma herself came to check on us (and serve us in between mixing up some outrageously delicious Mexican meals). They started out by serving homemade tortilla chips with 4 different salsas which were all amazing. We each got something different. Most got tacos (my favorite was shredded beef, my mom loved chicken), and my dad got chilaquiles which I couldn't stop eating. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Irma's exudes a fantastic atmosphere of tradition and intimacy. Quality service and a true sense of comfort make this little roadside hideaway a fine place to fill your appetite and be impressed with a glorious staff. An average price of 5 dollars, but a considerable amount of food, make this a restaurant worthy of city-loving praise and I am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"First off, expect a small parking lot, but we found street parking. Secondly, expect to the inside to be small. Third, expect to be greeted with a nice smile. Fourth, expect complimentary chips and salsa. Fifth, expect super affordable prices! I'm a huge fan of that. Sixth, expect your food to be amazing! We got the chilaquilas and asada platter plus 1 coffee = $15! Can it get any better than that? Everything was so delicious! The asada was very flavorful and the chilaquiles had bonus sour cream over it, and there were cute quotes from people all over the walls. I would definitely go back for sure!"}
{"text":"omg.  there are no words.  I am obsessed with mex.  I make it probably 5 times a week, but this is so much better.  I ordered the burrito with red sauce on top.  The beans were so flavorful and the red sauce - perfection.  If you are looking for hole-in-the-wall grub, this is your place.  The staff was also super nice.  We were a little sad that we didn't get to meet Irma herself, but I plan on eating here at least once a week, so hopefully I'll get to meet her one of these days.  Already salivating for my next trip here.  Gah."}
{"text":"IRMA'S is always a good place to eat and with generous portions and decent prices.i will return."}
{"text":"I've been searching Phoenix for the perfect chili relleno and I think I've found it here! This place is a tiny hole in the wall type joint and the food is excellent. Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall Mexican food ever!  Doesn't look like much on the outside but the interior is clean and quant (actually outside looks like a dump, but don't let that scare you off.)  First their fresh juice is delicious and was only $3.59 (I seriously paid $11 for a 24 oz that did not taste 1/2 as good as the 32 oz - saw them put in all the fresh veggies and fruits so I know it wasn't powder).   My son who hate Mexican food asked if we could go back for their beef burrito.  My other child had fluffy pancakes, perfectly done thick bacon and eggs for only $5.  Service was also friendly and efficient.  Interior is small so I can this place being packed on peak hours.  We had no problem being seated at 1pm on a Saturday.  Great food, good service and the price is a steal."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Just left the home and Garden show and the wife and I wanted something quick and close. We looked this place up and saw 5 stars. We found this little hole in the wall and glad we came. This place is really awesome and deserves the 5 stars. Great customer service and the food is fantastic. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here.    We found a room is on the way to Lake Havasu city. We had the Diablo special. It was spicy, Herby goodness. It was so good, we stopped on our way back east. I have the red chili enchiladas, with a poblano relleno.   My brother had a chicken quesadilla, with a side of crema chili poblano soup. Every bite was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was served by Irma herself, and I don't usually write reviews but wow was she amazing.  One of the best, if not best, servers I have ever had.  And on top of that, all the food, drinks, salsas, and chips were wonderful.  Oh and the prices.  You can't beat them for the amount of awesome food you get.  If you want a good meal, stop looking at other reviews and go here!"}
{"text":"Driving through Phoenix on a road trip back to So Cal and wanted lunch. We Yelped for suggestions and found Irma's. Amada welcomed us and we proceeded to order tacos, a quesidilla and a burrito. She tells us it has been open a year and the owner is cooking the food.   The tacos were delish... as were the quesidilla and burrito. Thanks Irma's for a good meal at a good price. Keep rockin\" it!"}
{"text":"Irma's is one of those rare places where I not only go for the delicious food but because I want to support the awesome people who make it! Very friendly customer service and the food portions are extremely generous for the pricing. I'll continue to come here for the breakfast burrito, which is the best I've had in the Valley. Everything is cooked to order and comes out piping hot!

I love that Irma is always making suggestions about adding ingredients to a dish or offering samples of new items. It keeps things interesting and I've never had a bad tasting dish here. Hope they keep getting business and stick around for a long time!

Just FYI - Seating space is small, so parties of 5 or more may have to split up. Max table size is 4 people from what I've seen."}
{"text":"Small hole-in-the-wall type joint in Phoenix. Free chips and salsa is always a good start to a meal! I got the beef tamale plate with a carne asada taco. The taco was delicious and flavorful and I also loved the beans and cheese. The tamale was a little dry in my opinion but still good. Everything is priced very reasonably! You really can't beat the price for what you're getting. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area and looking for some good, cheap Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best service ever. I showed up after they had closed and Irma was closing up and she was so upset she couldnt make me food that she invited me in for chips and salsa. My girlfriend and I were dumbfounded by what had happened. She was SO SWEET and genuine. With the incredible service and savory salsa I am definitely coming again. This is my first yelp review and it definitely deserves a 10/10."}
{"text":"Little Tiny place but the food and the staff were amazing. 
There was only one server. She was very friendly and attentive. The owner was very nice as well. She made fresh sweet bread and brought out to all the customers in the restaurant to sample. The Picture shows Menudo and Pozole.
Both were delicious . They remind me of my mothers homemade food. I would definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food ever, but it is home cooking at Irma's house with a reasonable price. I love it, everything I have tried is average or above but either Irma or her daughter make sure I have everything I need on my visits. I give 3 stars for food itself but the family atmosphere and superb service deserves a 5 star rating. Try it, You will like it."}
{"text":"The quaintest \"hole in the wall\" restaurant I've been to in a long time.  I love the way they present their chips & salsa plus.  You will definitely be served by a family member, it's that kind of authentic, which I love.  Irma's granddaughter who looks around 8 or 10 years old was also there quietly sitting at a table watching a movie while here Mom worked.  As for the food, it didn't disappoint...it's not texmex ( it is Arizona) lol, but I really liked it."}
{"text":"It was a little ghetto inside and out but very very good Mexican food!   Probably best I have had yet."}
{"text":"Irma's is just heaven, their salsas are to die for! The chicken mole dinner, the chicken was so tender you could cut it with a corn chip and the mole was a rich dark brown thick and creamy sauce with so much flavor. The rice was seasoned with cilantro and green chilis and the refried beans had a hint of a smoky bacon flavor. This meal was so great, I wanted to rub it on my head! And Irma did come by and made sure everything was perfect! I was compelled to buy extra salsa and chips (homemade onsite) because it's Friday and the soonest I can get back is Monday! I have no idea why Guy Fieri hasn't been here!"}
{"text":"What a sweet lady that Irma! The food is excellent. My hubby and I were rolling down the road to our car stuffed after only spending $11. Irma cooks up very home made cooked Meals and is always attentive.  We will be  back for sure ! I am jelous I don't live so close:)"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here after checking out the Grand Ave festival. We ordered the Carne asada taco plate long with the Loco elote.  The meat was tender and flaoverful, only.lacking some salt. Beans and rice were just okay. The corn was tasty and to the point.  All in all this place is worth trying if you're in the area.  I wouldn't  take a special trip out here just for the food.  Friendly staff is why I opted to give 4 stars instead of 3!"}
{"text":"While getting my windows tinted, I knew it would take a few hours. I looked up close food places. Had good reviews and I know why! Cute little place with GREAT service! And of course good food! I got the breakfast burrito its delicious!!! 
As I'm eating it has been busy!
So glad I found this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican food I have had in the Phoenix area so far. There is excellent variety on the menu, and everything I have ordered thus far has exceeded my expectations. Customer service is incredible, you are made to feel like you are at home. Parking and table space are limited, but you shouldn't have a problem most times of the day, or taking your food to go."}
{"text":"We are visiting from the LA area and was looking for a lunch spot after visiting the Heard Museum. My good friend's name is Irma, so wanted to try this place. But unfortunately, it was not as good as the ratings indicated. The service was great & the staff was very friendly. But the food wasn't anything to write home about. I had the chicken tacos & the chicken was very dry. My BF had chicken mole & his chicken was also dry. We shared some chicken flautas & they were the best out of the 3 items we ordered. But I don't think we will be coming back to this place again. And that's too bad."}
{"text":"Great food, love the red chili, breakfast burritos are awesome. Can't go wrong at this small spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday, after the lunch rush, with a friend from Japan. We were the only customers in the place, lucky for us! The owner and her daughters were hospitable and the food was excellent and a great price. 
The restaurant is small, with about 6 tables, so expect to share your table and meet some new friends if you go during lunch.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"What a find! My wife and I had business at the AZ State Capitol this morning; we finished up a little before 11 and decided to try someplace new on the way home. We found Irma's on Yelp and we'll be back again soon. The place looks a little sketchy from the outside but inside the wonderful smell from the kitchen hits you right away. I had the special Sope with green chile and egg and my wife had a Carne Asada bowl. Both dishes were outstanding (we always share bites). Everything was fresh, homemade, and tasty. Service was excellent and quick (Irma's daughter it turns out); we're excited to go back again and try something new. This place is worth a trip even if you don't normally find yourself in the area. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic homemade food!  Simply the best quality and service. Prices are very reasonable and the family staff is very friendly. The albondigas was spectacular. I'd highly recommend this place to locals and touristas."}
{"text":"Great food. Other reviews are correct that the place is small, and a little divey. However, food was excellent, service was great and it was SO cheap. I think this is a perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Back on vacation and chose Phoenix so we can eat at Irma's every day. Just as fabulous as we remembered! Freshest food, prepared expertly and the best service. We would give more  s if possible!"}
{"text":"Okay, my lovely friends.  I am going to give you a great gift and you can thank me later.  I just ate at Irma's Kitchen.  It's a little tiny Mexican food restaurant run by a woman named (amazingly!) Irma.  She is sweet and friendly and makes (wait for it....) the best Mexican food I have eaten outside of Mexico itself.  If you know me, Mexican is my comfort food, my favorite food in the world.  So, you know when I say this is more than likely the best Mexican food I've ever eaten, I am not blowing smoke.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Irma's Kitchen deserves more awareness and praise. Each person that walks into this small restaurant is greeted and treated with nothing more but sincere kindness. This place is very flexible in modifying the dining options offered to fit any person's needs or interests. The breakfast was good, the service was great, and it was REALLY cheap! Really hope sometime in the future they expand to a bigger location because they will most likely need it."}
{"text":"Amazing prices for an authentic, sit down casual restaurant that provides comp homemade chips and salsa. Portions are huge, too. I ordered 3 enchiladas with rice and beans. I wanted red and green sauce on my enchiladas so they made the top half red and the bottom half green. The sauces are homemade and authentic. My girl ordered green salsa chilaquiles with eggs over easy and they were great. The rice and beans were pretty good as was the service."}
{"text":"food is great. service is great!!
It was Taco Tuesday- lunch for two was only $11 ! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place with good breakfast burritos since I moved downtown... This is it!! Irma's food is AMAZING! Very friendly, good prices & large portions! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Very authentic and very inexpensive. You almost feel like you're in Mexico. Servers were very friendly and attentive. Mole Poblano was as good or better than many in town. Parking is tight and only a few tables so go early... and often!"}
{"text":"Cheap and great food!! Service is just like your at you home with conversation and quick, personable service!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've had!! You can tell they put a ton of love into their cooking. I had the lunch special #2 and oh my goodness!!! Delicious!! The portions were good. Red sauce was the best I've ever had! Beans were off the hook and loved the rice. Service was the very best I've had in a super long time. 2 meals and drinks for $14!!! Are you kidding me!! Coming back many more times and recommending to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with EXCELLENT food. Everything tasted like it was made from scratch from the chips to the enchilada sauce"}
{"text":"MUY BUENO
chips n salsa both green and red off the chart
Huevos rancheros FINALLY found a place that does it right"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! The salsa is incredible. I had the chicken chimichanga with green sauce and it was the best chimichanga I've ever had."}
{"text":"This business of best Mexican meal is difficult. There aRe so many strata of value/quality. Is Barrio, or our favorite upscale Presidio, really to be compared to good counter service like Azteca?. Irma's is in the running for best burro, breakfast or otherwise. Street tacos not so much. I Like their asada, but the machaca could use more punch. We Really like their enchilada sauce but red salsa is bland and watery. The service is superb especially Irma, but the seating and parking are sparse. Simply, you can have one of the best meals and experience in town, or you can have mediocre and wonder what the fuss was about. It's staying on our list because it's good."}
{"text":"Just started working in this area and was in need of a great Mexican food place for lunch. This is THE place. The restaurant is very appropriately named as it feels like you are sitting directly in Irma's kitchen while she feeds you. The food is amazing with incredible lunch specials for about $6. The service is absolutely exceptional. Irma and her family run the business and you will always be welcomed with a warm smile and delicious food. I would give 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"With a very early flight to Phoenix, we were hungry upon arrival and so I Yelped breakfast burritos and found many positive reviews of a small place a little off the beaten path in Phoenix called Irma's Kitchen.  We had a great time and a great breakfast here!  It only has a few tables and we were there early in the morning around 7:45 AM, and for the short time we were there, several familiar loyal local customers came in, so you can tell this place has a following.  Authentic Mexican food and we always like to go to local restaurants when we travel.  The service was great, we were greeted warmly by both Irma and our server, who got us water and took our coffee order immediately.  The breakfast burrito was what my wife was there for, and I got the chilaquiles.  Both were excellent.  The burrito was not too spicy, so my wife liked that, it had eggs, ham and potato (maybe bacon?) and the tortilla itself was really tasty, let alone the ingredients inside of it.  I tried it, and I liked it too.  My chilaquiles were excellent as well, in fact I liked that the tortilla pieces at the bottom were not all soggy like they sometimes are when I get this dish elsewhere.  They still had a little bit of crunch to them.  You can get them with either red or green sauce, and I went with green and it was great, it didn't overwhelm the dish at all and complemented it really well.  The eggs were right over top of the rest of the dish, and I liked that you could break the yolk and let it drip into the rest of the dish and combine it all.  VERY tasty dish! 

We found Irma charming, a really nice personable woman who cares about her cooking and her customers.  And we spoke to a man (I don't want to assume it's her husband, because I don't know that) and he was great, too.  Lunch and dinner menu looked great, by the way, as well.  We just really enjoyed the entire dining experience overall, the food itself, the service, and the interaction with the staff.  We will definitely return to Irma's when back in Phoenix.  It's not a fancy restaurant, it's an authentic local Mexican restaurant (although they actually  have hummus too) with great food and great people."}
{"text":"Hooray for Norm, my best restaurant scout! I've been wanting to go to Irma's for awhile and when I went, I was nothing short of impressed. The husband and I went for brunch. I had the chilaquiles Christmas style with over med eggs. He had the lunch special with a beef tamale and a cheese enchilada. Both were super tasty. They brought out chips and salsa first, which was fresh and surprisingly spicy (in a good way). My chilaquiles were delish... spicy, flavorful, great with the beans and the eggs... even the little unnecessary salad was good and added nice flavor to the dish. The husband's food was equally tasty, the tamale was wonderful with tender meat inside and complimented by their red sauce. The prices were ridic low. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This little spot with comfort food will satisfy your soul. Great food, great prices and the owner and her staff are inviting."}
{"text":"What a pleasant little gem not to be missed the food and service is just like being at your families place. The food is simple and complex all at the same time. Clearly homemade salsas very fresh addictive and the red one will put hair on your chest or burn it off you choose! The dishes are few simple classics but done well. Irma is a very sweet woman who really cares if you like what you are eating. Don't pass it up."}
{"text":"Best Rice and Beans from a Mexican Restaurant they actually have flavor!! BEST Chorizo and Papa Burro. Love the Shrimp Abondigas too. I wish there was a Salsa Rojo like most restaurants they currently offer Chunky Pico which isn't the best for everything, But it's still amazing with chips while you wait for your food!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito I've had in Phoenix. Straightforward and delicious. Possibly the best beans, as well"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a road trip that expanded across the United States. I checked Yelp for a referral for a Mexican breakfast. We decided to try Irma's kitchen. We ordered the chilaquiles and steak picado for breakfast. Both dishes were fabulous! The chilaquiles has a hint of spiciness (perfect)! The steak has a very tasty flavor! I am so happy we found such a great place for good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"They made me a breakfast  burrito like I wanted so I could not complain.  My girlfriend tried the chilaquiles and they were not good. We probably won't be going back . We are to picky when it comes to Mexican food, we'll just eat at home next time (: lol"}
{"text":"Great place to come and eat. The prices are great and the place has feel like you are at home. For 4.99 I got 3 tacos and rice and beans. Will definitely recommend and will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"We love this place. My kids and I come here all the time. It's small and parking sucks but it's worth it completely. Fresh chips!! Fabulous salsas. I've never had a bad meal here. I love the green and red chile; the chicken mole is delicious; my son loves the Sonoran Dog; the chiliquiles has real red or green sauce YUM! Just try it! You won't regret it. Trust me."}
{"text":"Back in town today for another training. Not only did Irma take my order on her cell phone after hours, she called me this morning to let me know my order was ready. Once again, huge hit with the kids at Troxell Communications. Will absolutely make this a habit when I come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for authentic mexican food. I had the pozole and chilaquiles and both were amazing. Great homely feel to the place. If im ever in town again Ill make sure to hit this spot up."}
{"text":"The chilaquiles and horchata are to die for but the best part about dining here is the staff! They really know how to make you feel at home and even offered me a donut while we were waiting for chips and salsa. Would give 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Irma's is an AMAZING find in Phoenix! Delicious food, friendly owner and staff, and their PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUSLY LOW!!!!
I was told to try the \"Mean Green\" aguA naturales, it was BEYOND DELICIOUS! Next time I'm passing through Phoenix I will be back for another meal. $28.00 (including tip) for 5 people to eat! That's amazing!!!! 
Just a note that it's small and there is no air conditioning.... But so worth it!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance scare you away (or even the inside appearance).  This is a gem.  We drove by once and a few minutes later decided it was time for lunch.  Yelp brought us back to this place.  Excellent food at a great price and generous portions.  Two lunches, chips and salsa for under $25.  A nice idea to let people leave notes on the wall.  Look for mine!!!!"}
