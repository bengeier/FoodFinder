{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant in Toronto! And it's the restaurant that I dine in most frequently, even more frequently than fast food. BBQ items are all highly recommended! The lamb kebab is probably the best that I've ever had in Canada. The only thing can compare is the one that I actually ate in Western China, Xinjiang province.  

The hand pulled noodles are cooked in a traditional manner and it tastes just like the ones that I had in China. And there're so many dishes for you to choose. No matter what we chose, it's just like a surprise and it's so good. 

Absolutely 5 star"}
{"text":"We had the lamb skewer, boiling fish here. It is alright. I have had Lamb skewers elsewhere in Toronto, the pieces wasn't very consistently fatty but the flavor is good, not too salty. The fish was also very mediocre. 

For uptown tho I would come back for the lamb skewer, but not for boiling fish!"}
{"text":"Its is a good Chinese food place.

The taste is same as it in China.

I forget to take picture, but you can come here and take photo!"}
{"text":"The parking lot seemed busy, but there were only 4 occupied tables. All food had a members' price and non-members' price, but no one bothered explaining or promoting the membership. Food tasted okay but was cold. The servers don't speak English and just assume you know Mandarin because you are Asian. Noodle portion is okay but everything else was on the smaller side and not really worth the price. Tried, but probably not going to be returning."}
{"text":"Portions are small and prices do not justify the portions given. Overall taste is good"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I've been here and I would give this place 3.5-4/5. They specialize in a lot of lamb dishes and they have a lunch special here! My favorite dish is the lamb and tomato with mushroom noodle soup ($7.45 I think?). It tastes super home-y and they use handmade sliced noodles which are chewy and yummy. Usually this dish isn't very spicy but mine had red pepper seeds for some reason so it was very spicy lol. It was also too salty this time but still very good. Good portions as well (sometimes not so much). The lamb skewers here are good and so is the fish one. I also love the lamb and eggplant rice that comes in a wooden pot. Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Over the last few years Xinjiang style BBQ places have been popping up all over the GTA.  Skewers of meat or veggies, grilled or fried and topped with hot and spicy rubs???  How can you go wrong??

Taste of Western China is located near Brimley and Sheppard in what was once probably an old Ponderosa as the layout looked like one;)  Western restaurant indeed!

They sell the skewered meats and veggies as well as the traditional noodles and dumplings. 
The food was okay with the standout being the thick beef noodles, and the fried crueller pancake egg wrap which was freaking huge!  The BBQ skewers itself was okay but a little overdone so the meat was a bit too dry.

The food came out quickly and service was good as the waiter was polite and courteous which is always plus in my books.  You can also buy a loyalty card for discounted pricing which seems to be common in all the Xinjiang BBQ places these days.  Over all a decent place for Western Chinese fare in the area."}
{"text":"I love the food here, and found the servers to be very friendly too - more so than your average Asian place that's for sure. It's has a spacious feel inside, good for accommodating groups (they have several large round tables).

BBQ lamb kebabs are a must-order here; you can specify how many you want to be spicy/non-spicy. I tend to order kebabs in separate batches throughout the meal so that I can eat them while they're warm. I also like their stir-fry hand pulled noodle dish with veggies and choice of meat (I always get lamb), and today we also decided to get the Xinjiang style bun with lamb meat and rolled green onion with beef. Each dish's flavour was so, so on point. I don't think I managed to take a single picture prior to digging in today, because the food was just that tempting to me. Be warned that some dishes are pretty greasy (on par with most Chinese restaurants), but they were worth every bite.

Heavily considering getting one of their VIP memberships to save a bit of $$ on their prices; we don't come here very often because it's out of the way, but when we do, we tend to order a lot at once..."}
{"text":"The best hand pulled noodles! The spices! The lamb! The dumplings! This place is so good! My boyfriend brings home an array of food from here any time he goes to Kelly Spa. 

Last time, yesterday I was home sick with a throat infection. Whenever I am sick I crave hot and sour soup. Though they don't serve hot and sour soup, they were kind enough to make it for us! And wow. They should put it on their menu. It's hot, but has so much depth. The wood ear, the carrots, everything is perfectly cooked. This is quickly become our recommendation to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I forgot to read my own review. I should have know not to order any noodle again at Taste of Western China. 

Sour and Spicy Noodle ($8.49) was just down right BAD! It is worse than the instant package (just add hot water version) from grocery store. The beans were stale and the taste of soup base did not have the right combination of sour and spicy aside from that layer of hot oil floating on top.

The monthly special Beef in chili oil (Reg $6.99, Special $1.99 if you like them on Wechat?) was not too good either. I would not be happy to have pay $7 for that and even at $2??

The BBQ Cabbage ($4.49) still our favourite!! Maybe I should just order one per person and nothing else?"}
{"text":"My family has been to this place many times and we really enjoyed it each time. The prices are amazing (especially if you have the membership card) and the portions are filling. Our favorites include the drunk chicken, the beef hand pulled noodles and the spicy apps. 
The servers here are friendly as well! Theres plenty of space to sit if you plan on bringing a larger party."}
{"text":"You're in luck if you want some authentic northern, western Chinese food!!! 

1) food: I highly recommend the cold noodles (y'all know what I'm talking about! See photo). There's not many places that can make them as authentically as this place. The spice and the salt is just right. The lamb skewers were also pretty great (told by my parents). My family also loved the beef brisket soup. And I personally loved the eggplant dish (best I've had) and the long beans!! 

But again: get the cold noodles. 

2) the atmosphere. Right when you walk in you're welcome by the smell of SPICE! And immediately your salivary glands are getting into action and your body's telling you, you're ready to eat! There's also plenty of space, not super crowded, large tables so it'll be good for large parties too. 

3) location: very conveniently located at a major intersection in Scarborough. If you're in the area, definitely worth the drop by. 

BONUS TIPS: they have a membership I believe it's $20 for 2 years and essentially you get 50-60% off on each dish!! It's super worth it, we got it on our first visit and we amount we spent on the membership was already saved in the first meal. So make sure you ask for it at the beginning! (Membership is cash only though)"}
{"text":"Great price for pretty authentic Chinese food. Western Chinese cuisines can be pretty spicy, and the default is usually spicy. Make sure you ask for non spicy if you cannot handle the heat. The BBQ fish was really juicy and delicious. I also really like the noodles and dumplings here."}
