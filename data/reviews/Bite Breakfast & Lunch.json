{"text":"We found this on yelp and delighted we did.  The vibe was laid back and chill and the food was good.  You must have the sweet potato pancakes...yummy!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!!! I could honestly say this was the best breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant, ever! The food is so fresh and flavorful. I never end up finishing my plate at a breakfast restaurant and although the portions were very generously sized, there wasn't a bite left on my plate (or maybe I should say skillet). It was so good! The green juice I had was also super delicious!! I saw a lot of other diners ordering pancakes and they all looked so good, I will definitely try these next time. In addition to the food being awesome, the service was excellent! You can tell it's a family owned and operated restaurant because the staff all genuinely seem to care and take pride in the restaurant. Everyone was extremely friendly and our coffee cups never sat empty. Can't believe it took me so long to try this place out but it will definitely be my go to breakfast spot from now on and I can't wait to try the lunch as well!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time today after reading the reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. They were slammed when we walked in, but they were so friendly and attentive that the wait didn't seem as long. 

There were so many tantalizing options on the menu, but we decided on the Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles and the Bacon Burger. I am a Chilaquiles connoisseur and for not being a Mexican restaurant, these were delicious! My family thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well. 

The attentiveness and service was great even though it did take a little more time than normal to get our food. It was definitely worth the wait. 

We will be back soon and we are happy to have found our new go-to brunch spot!

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. The food was bland. Their banana but French toast was not sweet. Their country fried steak, the gravy was runny and the steak had the wrong texture. The corned beef was good. The sign says wait to be seated, but the server told us to just pick any table. He wasn't busy, he only had 3 tables."}
{"text":"We were lucky to find this place. The food portions are huge and it tastes great. I ordered lunch and my wife was able to get breakfast. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The drinks never went dry and the food was served hot and fast. If you are in the area I highly recommend stopping in for a bite. I wish there were more stars to give."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular pancakes with a side of sausage and hashbrowns. My husband ordered the Ultimate Bite which has an egg cooked inside of a stack of pancakes with sausage and bacon sprinkled on top of it. 
Food: The food was GREAT!! It was hot and the portions were plentiful.
Service: Our waiter was pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was clean. There was a staff member cleaning the whole time we were there. 
Price: The prices were very reasonable especially considering the portions.
Ambiance: Small quaint family owned and operated. The reason that I didn't give it five stars is because it was HOT. I felt like I was eating outside. This wouldn't keep me from returning though. 
I definitely recommend you trying it out! We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is so good and healthy.  Great for loosing weight. The staff is very accommodating.  I will definitely be back.

Bianca is beautiful and I can't wait to work on her, for her spray tanning,  hair and make up.  

With all the great and healthy choices at bite, her body is in great shape and if I do say so myself,  the chefs aren't to bad to look at either."}
{"text":"We used to really love this place , we would go every couple Sunday's. The service has really gone down hill. After receiving horrible service and cold food I tried to reach out to the manager who never returned my emails or calls. They really used to be on top of their game. We'll never go back now"}
{"text":"This place has good breakfast served hot. Pancakes were great and the corned beef was seasoned well. My server was amazing and was able to take orders, serve meals and drop off the check and be the cashier for the entire restaurant while I was there. The busser removed the plates and kept the place clean to help keep up with the pace. The young host/busser did the same and was very pleasant. However, the young lady behind the register counter did nothing. Guests were forced to leave after waiting for 20 minutes while staring at clean tables and listening to this person tap her fingers on the counter watching her co-workers run around like crazy. It was horrible to watch. Please re-train this person."}
{"text":"Im 9 months pregnant and wanted some pancakes. I'm tired of the other main chain breakfast places and wanted something better. I found this place on Yelp and the reviews were high. 

I walk in and its very friendly. The staff all spoke and said hello. The lady sits us down with menus and goes to help others. When she did i noticed she sat down and really went over the menu with guest. She answered all there guestions with a smile and made it personal.  When she came to us she did the same thing. Talked to my 10 yr old daughter and broke it down for what she wanted. Then took me and my husband's order.

We got the cold pressed fresh squeezed oj......AMAZING JUICE! It reminded us of juice we would get in Michigan. 

My husband talked to the owner about just buying the juice. The owner infomed us that people do it all the time, he sales it by liters.  

The food was AMAZING! It was more and better than i could have imagined. I got the strawberry pancakes with the combo and the redskin potatoes. (Dont judge me, i said im pregnant) It was more food than i could eat. The pancakes to my suprise had fresh strawberries cooked in them!!! The top was filled with strawberries too! My sausage was huge not your regular get frome the store morning sausage. It was all great food! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and came on a Wednesday for a late breakfast.  We both had pancakes which were excellent. All of the food and coffee were delicious.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great people! Today, my wife and I enjoyed our first experience immensely! Hope they continue to provide great customer service and great food and surround themselves with workers who have the same work ethics and personality! Keep up the good work!

Shawn and Bertha"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better than this as far as breakfast goes. My mom and I stop by this place every time she comes into town. It's kind of become a tradition. We always order a skillet or an omelet and a wonder berry waffle to share and have yet to be disappointed! I'm a sucker for good custumer service so that's what really sets this place aside, in my opinion. The staff is always incredibly attentive and polite and start off my mornings just right!"}
{"text":"The best place in vegas for breakfast. Nice and cozy tucked away. A hidden gem. Great staff and great food. Huge menu. Been there for lunch and that is great too.I would never go  anywhere else"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Breakfast is on POINT! New favorite spot. Great staff and friendly environment. Will be coming back soon to try the lunch menu which looks good too!"}
{"text":"I had a bite to eat with my mom and sister at this cute restaurant. Very friendly staff and the food is extremely fresh with lots of choices. I would highly recommend it. Thanks Jaryd for your positive attitude, humor and great service! See you next time."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I  came to Vegas for day from LA and we were looking for a place to have breakfast, went on Yelp and saw this place and the pictures of the food they had looked AMAZING !!! When we got here the staff were very friendly ! Great service and the food is outstanding ! This place is definitely a must!!!! Everything is great about them !"}
{"text":"Love this place, we come eat here about 3/4 days a week! I always get the tuna Manhattan, so bomb! Great service, always friendly and with a smile. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was old and discusting. I dont know how is possible this place to have so many  high reviews. I will rated 0 if i could. 


Peter from Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast/brunch spot. Staff is always friendly...food is always tasty and served quickly. Husband's favorite is the corned beef hash; I have several - omelettes, morning wraps, pancakes ---all great! We love that the menu isn't just traditional breakfast items. They even have selections with a Hawaiian flair!  There's something for everyone at Bite."}
{"text":"Fresh pressed juice is unbelievable and presented in a nostalgic natural mason jar, loved it!!! Service was great, friendly staff and portions were huge. My new fav breakfast spot for sure."}
{"text":"This was an awesome find, staff was friendly and willing to talk story. Food was crazy good, one of the best corned beef hash I have ever had. Did not have to wait long at all for food, and if I had it would have been worth the wait. To me 5 stars is not a high enough rating!"}
{"text":"So impressed with this resturant! It is only open until 3p daily so we felt kinda bad arriving for lunch at 230p but we were greeted with open arms.

Our waiter was extremely nice and welcoming. I had THE BEST tuna melt that I have ever had. The bread was amazing and toasted to perfection. The sandwich had a thick slice of fresh avacado on it at no extra charge. The tomato was fabulous. I asked for pepper jack cheese instead of the cheddar that is ordinarily on it and it was perfect! The fries are great... as is their ranch dressing... not too sweet.

The pancakes are HUUUUGE and fluffy. 

I had a raspberry lemonade and it was awesome! Not too sweet and no weird artificial flavors. There were actual raspberries in it.

Every employee was extremely nice and attentive. I highly recommend Bite!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was awesome, big portions of food well done! Our waitor jerry was a cool dude and provided great service. Great place to come and eat and spend some time."}
{"text":"OK I'm just going to have to say it best breakfast place have ever eaten. And I have eaten at a lot of breakfast places I love breakfast food they had awesome options I got the kale cucumber spinach juice which was amazing and Hashbrowns corn beef and a poached egg with toasted banana bread on the side I wish I could've tried more! But I couldn't fit it in my stomach"}
{"text":"Have been seeing their \"coming soon\" ads in the neighborhood paper for awhile.  So when a buddy of mine who lives near the strip happened to be in the area, I figured it was a good chance to try it out.
Went there yesterday during lunchtime.  The place was fairly empty, maybe people still don't realize that they're open.
They have a large menu, maybe too large, definitely something for everybody.  At first I was excited to see they offer a Monte Cristo sandwich (an increasingly difficult item to find), however I didn't order it when I found out that they do not use thinly sliced ham, instead it contains thick cut ham:(  My buddy ordered it, and he said it was good, but I couldn't pull the trigger.  
I chose the classic Las Vegas breakfast combo: eggs, bacon, potatoes & toast. Everything was good, however my fave thing were the hash browns.  They're cut differently than any I've seen elsewhere, they're flat and wider than usual, almost like short pieces of fettucine.
The service was excellent.  The owner greeted us when we walked in, our server was very attentive and knowledgeable, our drinks were refilled quickly when they got low.  Overall, the place is good, and a welcome addition to the line up of eateries in the Spring Valley area.  Good Luck."}
{"text":"They have by far the most Amazinggggggg Orange juice I have ever tasted , the food was okay. 

I ordered the ultimate pancakes because of all the good reviews , they were okay . Next time I come by I'm definitely getting something different.. 

Service was also great , we had ordered some pancakes and they forgot to bring them to our table , it was okay though because by the time we finished what we had already ordered we were stuffed !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The food is amazing, the people are so nice and I love the vibe!! Zero complaints, come here all the time."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was mediocre. My husband and I both got omelettes and they both were not what we asked. He did a BYO and asked for tomatoes, peppers, onions and bacon. He didn't get any tomatoes or bacon. I got the garden and asked for no olives and added bacon but instead got olives and no bacon. Fresh squeezed juice was good but pricey."}
{"text":"Bite is the bomb. Great food, always consistent. Staff very friendly and on the ball."}
{"text":"Delicious everytime.  Freshly squeezed juices and creative menu.  Staff is super friendly and attentive.  Probably going to be our new favorite spot every Sunday."}
{"text":"OK so first of all let me say that I was blessed! My Friends and I were beyond blessed with two tables of bite's distinctive all American breakfast and lunch plates!! So delicious! Flavorful and filling! I was so stuffed! My mom would say your eyes are bigger than your stomach, this was the case here! Amazing customer service! I was greeted and farewell'd with a smile! The friendly staff took my orders and food came out with a smile! Personal favorites : The new meatloaf plate, funfetti pancakes, and fresh avocados on top of the Spanish plate, que delicioso! Such a relaxing place away from the noisy busy Las Vegas strip great to get away to eat and enjoy the great vibes! I am not that easy to please especially because I am in the customer service field where I push my employees to perform at a prime level of excellence!"}
{"text":"We had sweet potato pancakes and banana bread French toast and it was amazing!! Fun vibe inside with reggae music. Great service too!! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent & the food was great ! The menu was big and there is something for everyone. Carlos is an amazing server. I got the fried chicken and egg. The gravy on the chicken was one of the best gravy that I ever had."}
{"text":"I confess to being selfish. If I like a restaurant, I might not write a review because good reviews draw business, and I prefer uncrowded. However, this area seems to be where restaurants I enjoy come to die. I miss Manhattan Fish Grill & Custom Built pizza.

Having said that, I tried this place for the first time , and I hope that they will succeed here.

I ordered two b.y.o. omelets to go (no, one was for my wife). Both were very good.

When I arrived to pick up the meals, my first impression was \"oh oh, few cars in the parking lot, and lots of empty tables, yet many servers. How long will they last here?\"

Based upon my first experience I'd recommend Bite Breakfast and Lunch to my friends, and I definitely want to check out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 4. Oma had Turkey club and fruit which she loved. My son had chicken and fries the chicken was mediocre and the fries were wonderful. They were out of crepes so my husband had to have pancakes Banana Foster instead of Crepes Banana Foster the pancakes were overcooked. I had the cinnamon roll French toast which was overcooked but tasted okay. The manager was super nice. The waitress was friendly but never came back to ask us for refills we had to ask someone to get us refills. At the end the manager gave us 15% off because of the issues with the overcooked food and the chicken that was not there only the breading."}
{"text":"Their fresh squeezed OJ is the best!! It's my favorite and I get it every time I'm here. The Spanish skillet is also another favorite. All the workers are really friendly, amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast spot! Came here with the hubs on a Monday morning, so thankfully it wasn't too busy. We shared the huevos rancheros and blueberry pancakes, and both were delicious. The pancakes were so fluffy and tasty, and I want to try the others on the menu next time! The huevos rancheros were not the best I've ever had, but they were definitely yummy and satisfying. We will be back fo sho! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful, fun restaurant. The service and food are great. Food is fresh. Jarryd is a efficient, friendly server. 
We will be back and recommend BITE to our friends and family."}
{"text":"Hubby ordered Blueberry pancakes with side of sausage patty and over easy eggs. I ordered Eggs Florentine with hash browns (there version is a little thicker) but crisped nicely and yummy. Hollandaise sauce could be improved. French press coffee is great. We'll be back, lots of different things to choose from. Service is terrific"}
{"text":"Yup, this is a \"real deal\".  I went to bite cuz I had just finished a 5k at a golf course on the west side of Vegas, and was looking for a \"non Vegas\" type of place for breakfast. Great fresh squeezed juices.  I had apple, ginger and pineapple mixed, very tasty. Nice twist on presentation of several breakfast classics. Dishes did NOT smell or taste of old stale grease from the grill. Good attentive service. Outside and inside decor totally unpretentious.  Great value for the dollar.  If I lived here, I would be back many more times."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall cafe that my family and I thought we should try. Good place to get away from the large crowds at the commercial breakfast places.

Service is exceptional. 

Prices are fair.

Ambiance is basic.

Food is good. Large portions. Although the hollandaise sauce is bland. Chicken fried steak was crispy but the steak was chewy. The Bite Benedict was nice and spicy. My little one devoured ALL of her Mint Chocolate chip pancakes (a rarity that she finishes a plate of food).

In conclusion: will come back"}
{"text":"I tried several things because it was our first time here and everything was excellent: buttermilk pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, corn beef hash, red potatoes, hash browns, sausage links and eggs (over easy). They also have cold-pressed, fresh juice which was fantastic - I tried the apple, pineapple and orange juices.

They bring the syrup in a big, warm bottle and have all the other condiments you'd need. 

I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came in for a late breakfast on New Years Eve.  My omelet was very good as where the red potatoes...probably my favorite part of breakfast.   My bf had the chicken fried steak, which was actually a real steak breaded and fried.  It was a bit rare for his liking, but he didnt send it back so he's not allowed to complain!  Service was friendly and prompt.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Creative options for breakfast and lunch. Variety of offerings including American, Mexican and combinations you never thought of. Quaint diner atmosphere. Friendly staff. 

Had the beer cakes which were pancakes made with Guiness Stout and a traditional omelette. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Had the cinnamon toast crunch French toast and coffee..the waitress was top notch, it filled up quickly, and the food was really quick."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there food was amazing I had the chicken fingers best ones in town by far the staff was friendly and very attentive atmosphere was nice definitely recommend eating there"}
{"text":"Best breakfast lunch and dinner great atmosphere and delicious food... i recommend this to everyone i know even if you come from out of town."}
{"text":"This is mine and my boyfriend's second time here. To start off, they have some great customer service going on here. They remembered us right off the bat, and our server remembered that my boyfriend and I liked to share the strawberry basil lemonade together. The pricing for the restaurant is descent, averaging around $7-$15. The portions are pretty big, so be prepared to take some home with you.

The first time we were here, I can't recall what we ordered, but I remember leaving satisfied. 

This time around, my boyfriend ordered a Spanish omelette with an English muffin and hash browns. I got a chocolate pancake (which comes with three stacks), scrambled eggs, and bacon. It took less than 15 minutes for us to get served.

The chocolate pancake was more than delicious. (I loooove chocolate btw, so for the average person, one might think it is too chocolatey.) The stacks were very light and fluffy -- basically melting sweetness onto my taste buds. I enjoyed the scrambled eggs, which were salted nicely. My boyfriend said his Spanish omelette was \"alright\". He took a bite of my pancakes and said the same thing I did: \"They're reeeally good.\" 

Altogether, in my experience, I really liked their food. It's even better when you're already building up an appetite and you get blasted with good food. I'd recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Don't go, turn around and eat somewhere else. No idea how this place has so many good reviews. This was our second visit here. The first time we went, service was decent, food was pretty good. At the end of our meal, the busser ended up accidentally knocking the glass syrup bottle off the table, which cracked into pieces and spilled. The busser was apologetic but the server/manager did not even provide an apology or a discount/comp. What frustrated me more was the server yelled at the busser in front of customers instead of assisting with the clean up, talk about unprofessional. 

As for today's visit, food was just ok and service was terrible. We asked the server multiple times for coffee creamer, waited for our side of toast that sat on the counter to be picked up, and was told the side of fruit came with blackberries, blueberries, raspberries...what came out was a bowl of apples that were discolored, mushy strawberries, sour slices of mangoes with the skin, and mushy bananas...it looked as if this fruit bowl had been prepared last week. Oh and did I mention the restaurant was practically empty. Too expensive. Do yourself a favor and head over to Rise and Shine or Egg Works, which are both nearby."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place, and definitely glad I did. The strawberry cream cheese French toast is delicious. And the orange juice is freshly squeezed and the best oj I've ever had. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great service unfortunately can't make up for subpar food and high prices. The 12 dollar southwest salad was basically just a small house salad with black beans and shredded chicken. The 13 dollar cheeseburger came out rare and made me vomit, literally. The servers were great and took it off the bill and everyone was super nice. I can see most people have had better experiences so I guess I was just unfortunate, but with so many options for good food nearby I doubt I will be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a climbing trip and needed to refuel after 3 days in the desert. This place is too good! Had the brisket and eggs with potatoes and orange juice. Some of the best breakfast I've had in a long time. Atmosphere was on point with good music and friendly staff. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Came here with family and had a great breakfast. We ordered French toast, pancakes, waffles, a tuna sandwich, and everything was great. Come with an empty stomach because they give big portions."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service good.  Prices were a high for breakfast lunch fare.  Juice eas $8.  A little much."}
{"text":"Hands down best breakfast and lunch spot in town. Recently moved to their new location in the southwest area. I've tried almost every flavor of pancake on their menu and each is exceptional, but the sweet potato waffle is beyond compare. Not to mention the customer service and hospitality is phenomenal. If you're in the area you have to try, and if you're not then it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Super underwhelmed. Second time here and I'm sad for them. 
There are so many bomb places to eat breakfast in LV. This one is off the list.
Positive: waiter was super nice, friendly and attentive 
Negative: 
Waffle machine was broken...
Joe's wrap minus meat was literally like something I make at home
Might I suggest a garnish of some sort? Fruit on the side(like 3 grapes and some berries, doesn't need to be extravagant) or even an orange slice? Legit looked like my mom made it at home... 
The water also tasted funny... possibly tap water? Get a Brita, the water in LV is not good to drink out of the tap. (Despite what the water district says) Was prescribed by my vet not to feed my dogs tap water. So why would you feed it to people? 
Best of luck Bite"}
{"text":"I was greeted soon after walking in and chose a table.  My coffee was quickly delivered with a menu and a water (thank goodness because I was parched).  My server came over and informed me of some changes in the menu.  I thought this was great!  There's nothing worse than setting your mind on something and the restaurant being out of it.
As I'm sitting waiting for my food I notice the place is pretty busy but the servers are working efficiently and as a team.  The decor is pretty basic but I'm more interested in the food.  
Good was super fast!!
I ordered the eggs florentine.  It's delicious. I would make a few minor changes but this is my first time here and ordering this dish, anywhere. 
Bonus... Sublime on the speakers! I'll take it!
Fyi, it's Easter Sunday and there are a few families here enjoying their time together.  Makes me miss my family but also feel happy that they get to spend time in such a laid back environment.  
Love!"}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite breakfast places in Las Vegas and truly a hidden gem! The owner always greets us as old friends and the staff is very nice, attentive, and accurate. Any (rare) mishaps are taken care of without question. We have never had anything we didn't like!

Be sure to try the Bite's Ultimate Pancake you won't want anything else!"}
{"text":"Soo good loves the food here I order Belgian waffles with poached eggs and sausage links and let me tell you yummmm!! Not to mention the have bomb warm syrup !!!my boyfriend had steak and eggs and the steak was cook just right am it was fat and juicy never seen a breakfast steak look so good!! BITE's is AMAZING!! Will be returning! Oh and the OJ on point guys try it!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service! Definitely my favorite spot in town hands down . Fresh OJ is on point always have a good breakfast !;)"}
{"text":"Came here for a sister brunch and it was good!!! I had the apple waffle (really good !) with Apple limon kale juice ( a little sour) but over all very friendly and good food."}
{"text":"The stuffed breakfast steak may be the greatest invention since........ Breakfast, lol. Ivan was an awesome server and kept us smiling. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Came in this morning for my first time and was greeted with a staff that was super friendly and served me like we had known each other for years.. I ordered the corn bread chicken and waffles and they were excellent.. Definitely would come back! 10/10"}
{"text":"Excellent service...all the guys were friendly, fast, and smiling!   Very casual place, excellent food....great neighborhood find!"}
{"text":"We are a group of 5 friends and avid hikers who happen to be regulars at Bite. We often stop by after a nice and long early morning hike, and the great food and friendly service always hit the spot. Their food is consistently fresh and delectable, the coffee and juices delicious, and the service on point. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Bite is clean! It was wonderful, tasty, wholesome food. The Guinness pancakes have bacon pieces IN them- Brilliant! The Special Omelet was creamy, yet fluffy. The service was promo and attentive even thought the place was packed. We rolled back out to the car full, and happy. Vegas!- help this place stay alive! Eat at Bite."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. Great food, service, and price point. As someone with allergies to gluten, diary, and garlic, I know I'm not the easiest costumer to deal with. To my surprise everyone at Bite didn't just tolerate me, they made me feel welcome. No eye rolls, no passive aggression. Christina and Andre really cared about me and what I could eat. As someone who always has a level of fear going out to eat, especially breakfast restaurants, it was a luxury to eat comfortably at Bite. I will return no question!"}
{"text":"The folks at Bite were very nice, however the service was painfully slow.    We were completely forgot about for 45 minutes and when our food came, my pancakes were still raw on the inside.  They need a cook behind the grill that can work in a high speed environment.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"There food was amazing!! I tried their Eggs Benedict and I must say that, that hit the spot!! I loved the service and the environment was very cozy! I would definitely check this place out if you are looking for a good \"bite\" to eat for brunch or breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast had the huevos rancheros the were great the staff was very friendly and attentive. I saw many dishes come out that I want to try in future visits. I live on there side of town but I will definetly be coming back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been impressed with a restaurant in forever! The service is beyond amazing, while the food stays true to the goodness of being made from scratch! Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Driving back from Zion National Park, yelped a couple place. I'm glad I picked this place, Great breakfast, great service and awesome options of food. Would defiantly come back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast and lunch spot.  Good Mexican American dishes with a surprise twist to the recipes.  Fast too and great service."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Finally a place that has amazing service, is clean, and great food! Corn beef hash is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The service the same.  Locally owned and wow do they appreciate your business.  All juices are fresh squeezed!  We had the monte cristo benedict, Bite's specialty pancakes stuffed with bacon, sausage, and  they squeeze a fried egg in between the stack, we also ordered a side of their homemade corn beef hash.  So glad we ate after our tour of Red Rock Canyon as we were immediately in a food coma after this scrumptious meal. You WILL NOT be disappointed.  Oh and they make their own maple syrup served warm!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with a taste of island music playing in the background. Had the banana nut French toast with eggs and suasage which was very tasty. Our server was great and the food was brought in quickly. Very nice atmosphere and family friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious! So glad we discovered this restaurant via Yelp! Cute place, service was fast and friendly, and the food was AWESOME! There were so many reviews on Yelp about their OJ so I had to try it. It is truly FRESH squeezed orange juice! My hubby had the Kale pineapple juice and that was also delish! My son had the skirt steak special, hubby had the jalapeño cheese biscuits and gravy with corn beef hash on the side, and I had the French toast sampler of: the Elvis (the bacon on top was just perfect), OoLaLa (strawberry/cream) and the cinnamon roll French toast (cinnamon roll cut in half and cooked like French toast). WOW! All great and amazing flavors. If you order the French toast, make sure to get the sampler so you try 3 of the choices. Nice touch that the maple syrup was warmed and the drinks were served in mason jars. We will definitely be back and will recommend this place to our family and friends!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time and I must say, I agree with all of the positive reviews. The food was great! Had the Ultimate Pancakes and my little one had the Funfetti Pancakes. I was pleasantly surprised that they had an option for a kid's portion with her pancakes, which was half price of the full portion, because she does not eat that much. My meal came in a large portion, which I practically demolished :), and loved every bite of it. Was too excited to eat to take a pic (sorry lol) however, both meals looked pretty true and accurate to the pics already posted by previously yelpers. So in all, great food, comfy atmosphere and am sure I'll be back at some point to try some of their other menu options. Great find!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fantastic, and Carlos was able to make sure our food was just right. 

Bite Benedict (4.5/5)- eggs Benedict meets chorizo & eggs. Eggs were cooked perfectly (which is usually my biggest worry when I order a Benedict at a new spot), and the Hollandaise was on point (they went light on the chipotle for me since I'm a wuss).

Fresh squeezed OJ was delicious- 5/5

Hazelnut pancakes (5/5)- insane!  My husband didn't finish them (even with me sneaking a few bites off his plate), so we brought them home to snack on later. Warm syrup is the perfect touch!

Military discount to top it all off. It's a drive if you don't live in the southwest- but it's a drive worth making. We will be back - have our eye on the Monte Cristo and Gatspy burger"}
{"text":"I had the hash, hash browns and eggs this morning and it was outstanding, definitely don't miss this breakfast! The service was excellent, they are very attentive and everyone does a great job! I have eaten at a lot of breakfast restaurants and this one has impressive food with a good price."}
{"text":"My first time here with some friends, i had the country fried steak, in my opinion it was a 10/10 ! My girlfriend had the fried chicken and eggs. Since she doesn't eat red meat. She said her chicken was very tender and tasted great.Not only the food here is great, the staff here is outstanding ! Our server Carlos was very attentive and very nice!  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot, got the lemon poppy pancakes combo. Pancakes were really generous size & have that slightly crunchy outside that I love! Also got fresh-squeezed guava juice, also delicious. Owner & staff were great, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great, everyone is very friendly. I've had the strawberry cream cheese French toast and the cinnamon apple pancakes and both were delicious. The serving sizes are huge so I find myself regretting ordering a combo every time I do, but I just can't resist the red skin potatoes (very fresh and crispy). The only thing I've tried here so far that I haven't been a fan of is the cinnamon toast crunch French toast, it sounded great in theory but the execution was lacking. Overall, I will keep coming to this place whenever I'm craving a hearty breakfast!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine asked to go here and I'm not sorry at all. Really good food, really cool girls working there and the guy who I think is the owner was definitely interested in making sure that the clients were satisfied so he suddenly would walk around making sure everyone is happy.  Definitely I'm coming back."}
{"text":"First they put my party of 3 at a tiny table, but I was willing to overlook that. (Oh yeah and they almost seated people that came in after us before us.) We put in our order and after waiting an hour, asked how much longer it would be. The waiter told us they were just waiting on the French toast. He goes to the window and tells me that they are just waiting on the French toast then brings out the orders for two other tables that came after us which included orders of French Toast. I was livid at this point and decided it wasn't worth the wait (over an hour) and terrible service. As we were walking out, he tells my husband that his Monte Cristo is already being made but none of the other food was even started even though he told us 5 minutes ago that they were just waiting on my French Toast! Seriously NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE for overpriced items and TERRIBLE service! If you really want a good breakfast, try BabyStacks or Egg Works! This place was a huge disappointment! The least they could've done was offered a discount or something for our trouble."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place and they're all very welcoming great customer service and I must say there mint chocolate chip pancakes are my top favorite."}
{"text":"Great customer service and awesome delicious food! As a fist timer, I didn't know what to get but I opted for the chilaquiles. It was served quickly and beautifully! I also appreciated their fresh juices, so yummy. Definitely coming back:)"}
{"text":"I love the carrot juice and the wraps and the everything is really good. The owner is really nice and they have great customer service"}
{"text":"Delicious cold pressed juices served in mason jars. The apple lemon ginger and the guava were fantastic. Pork jalapeño omlette and chorizo benedict were amazing recommendations from our server. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Andre and his crew are doing it right here. We had the funfetti and ultimate pancakes, corn beef hash, chicken fajita, corn bread chicken and waffles, chorizo eggs benedict and chorizo egg rolled steak. All were great with prime ingredients. Cold pressed juice had a lot of flavor. Good atmosphere and huge menu, plenty more to try next time."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken and Cornbread waffles are amazing! I can never decide on a plate because everything is so good!!! The chilaquiles, corned beef, stuffed steak... its all sooo good!!! The music is perfect and the staff is vey pleasant. The service is top notch! I would recommend you visit the Bite daily!! I wish I could, but I live in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. Many different options for pancakes, several different French toasts, and some things you just don't find on every menu (like Monte Cristo eggs Benedict). The fresh pressed juices are really great. It is a little pricey for what you get... Plan on $120 (with tax and tip) for 5 adults and a kid."}
{"text":"All the reviews were great so we thought we'd put Bite next in our search for the best breakfast place in Las Vegas.  I should have paid more attention to the map, and failing to do that we twisted around a couple of malls before we eventually found it.  Our GPS had said \"You have arrived,\" while we were still in the street between two different parking lots.  

Except for their sign on the wall, the decor was Spartan and full-on open plan with tables that they can push together or apart to accommodate the size of your party.  Not much privacy, if that is your thing.  But it was pleasant and 

Maybe owing to the spare surroundings I was moved to order the cranberry and walnut oatmeal with a side order fruit bowl.  I guess I didn't feel too adventurous.  It looked better on the menu than it really was, but then it's pretty hard to dress up oatmeal so I don't take away any points for that.  

My wife ordered what she said was BBS Eggs Benedict, which I can't find on the posted menu but was eggs Benedict on French toast.  She thought it was great but the drawback was the cinnamon on the french toast  Seemed like an unusual mix of tastes.  She was in love with the hash browns.  and 

One up side for us was that it wasn't at all crowded when we got there.  It did fill up during our stay but when we got there somewhat late there was no waiting at all."}
{"text":"This place is always such a pleasure to visit. The food is great and the staff is awesome! Had the hazelnut pancakes today. So good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good for kids and adults! Great atmosphere, laid back and cozy! Great wait staff! Could ask for anymore! The apple lemon ginger juice is amazing!"}
{"text":"We did not enjoy the atmosphere or the staff, the open kitchen can be a fun part of a dining experience but at Bite that is not the case. Here you just get to witness all the confusion and spats between kitchen and servers. It made us feel tense during our visit. Our server was very hard to find so we were forced to flag down other staff members rushing around this over cramped restaurant. Our food took quite a while to come from the kitchen and when it did  some of the food was under done. When our server finally reappeared to check on us we informed her and asked for the bill. After another 10 minutes of waiting another staff member brought it too us with a kind \"take your time\" but we couldnt qait to leve. The bill was expensive for food that was mediocre at best. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! Found it on Yelp and chose to try it out. It was so good we came back a 2nd time while on our trip. I tried their homemade orange juice and their watermelon mint lemonade. Highly recommended. I also ordered their chicken sandwich w/ chipotle mayo and their chilaquiles."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot, very inexpensive by Las Vegas standards. We had the stuffed steak with corned beef hash, huevos rancheros, and the favoite omelet and everything was phenomenal. The ingredients are fresh and the service was impeccable. Only open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Very, very good food! Andrey, the owner, treated us so well. We had churro French toast, hazelnut pancakes, chicken chilaquiles, and chicken strips that didn't really look like strips but tasted very good! I was a little skeptical about ordering the chilaquiles at first because I am Mexican so if I want Mexican food I make it at home but I was not disappointed at all. The green sauce was so tasty and the tortillas were crunchy just how I like them! I will definitely be coming back to try more of the plates. Thank you Andrey!"}
{"text":"I love going to brunch with my friends on the weekends and we really enjoy trying new fun places! Bite will definitely please everyone!!! Ever since I tried one of their Fresh Cold-Pressed Juices I have been dying for more... The Cinnamon Crunch French Toast is orgasmic along with their lemon poppyseed pancakes! The only problem is that EVERYTHING looks SO good on the menu is hard to decide and so far everything I've tried is just as good as it looks! This is becoming a favorite of my family & friends!"}
{"text":"Came here due to baby stacks being extremely packed, looked on yelp and found this place came over immediately. Service was really great!! Got seated instantly, menu prices were just like baby stacks but once we got our food we got a lot more bang for our buck!!! Stack of 3 nice fluffy pancakes along with eggs and bacon!! Compared to the tiny pancakes u get at the other place. I got the Banana Walnut pancakes and my girlfriend got the Caribbean Cakes and both were delicious!! Def recommend this place to friends and anybody else looking for a new breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I really enjoyed the banana nut bread French toast. I also ate most of my husband's red roasted potatoes, they were amazing.  The service was great.  We were checked up on often.  The place was clean. I wish there was more of a theme or decor to look at. I will return!!"}
{"text":"Had the biscuit and gravy with their hash brown, it was good. Gravy is made in house and had chunks of meat.  The hash browns are shredded potatoes with seasoning cooked on the grill. If you're looking for crispy potatoes then the red potatoes might be a better choice (fried). I like my coffee mild, their coffee was a little on the bitter for me. Not sure if this was a one time deal but we had two people waiting on us. One was our server and the other getting our drinks and making sure we were happy. Really like that."}
{"text":"This used to be an absolute must weekly visit, but today was different. The server let us know that they couldn't make crepes, which was fine because I wanted waffles. They didn't have those either, so I asked if they could make a pancake. Now all of these things use the same batter traditionally, so I asked if they had a waffle maker and was informed that the waffles had to be bought. I'm not sure why they couldn't make crepes since it uses the same ingredients as pancakes, but it was a bizarre off day and ruined my favorite meal here as I now know the waffles are store bought and frozen. might as well be buying eggos lol they either microwave or put the waffle in a little oven.  I had assumed everything was fresh. What a bummer but it doesn't make sense to spend $12-$14 for 1-2 frozen waffles"}
{"text":"Hours on Yelp say 7am, got there and they don't open till 8am. Thanks for the wasted drive."}
{"text":"Bite was pretty darn tasty! I received a weekly Yelp update highlighted the amazing pancakes and figured I would check it out.

Despite the great pancake reviews, I had an omelette craving so I orders the classic omelette. It was perfect..sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, avocado, and goat cheese. The ratio of veggies and cheese was spot on. It came with hash browns or seasoned red potatoes, and toast. My favorite part of the meal was the raisin bread toast!! It was unusually fluffy for toast..I loved it. 

There was a 15 minute wait to be seated. I only gave 4 stars because it took 20+ minutes for the food to arrive at the table after ordering.

Very friendly staff and overall clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new breakfast spot today since I always frequent the same ones and I'm so glad I did! Started with the fresh squeezed orange juice which came in a cute mason jar, usually not one to get orange juice at breakfast just because it can get pricey and I prefer to eat my calories but this was definitely worth it! For entrees I shared the peanut butter & banana French toast ( A MUST GET) and the favorite omelet (I think that's what it's called, mushroom goat cheese tomatoes veggies) both of which were delicious! Honestly no complaints at all, really glad I tried this place and I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu! Oh and I think the place is run by a girl named Bianca, she gave excellent service, along with the chefs. Felt a great \"family\" vibe!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Loved the sweet potato waffle. Hubby got the southern eggs Benedict and it was perfect. Fresh squeezed OJ was great. Staff was super friendly and made the whole experience awesome. This is a must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Looked at the menu online after Eater listed them as a great place for midweek brunch.  The menu lists a selection of mimosas and cocktails so we thought we'd give it a try.  When we arrived we were told that they don't offer any of the alcoholic beverages mid-week.  Such false advertising on behalf of the company and Eater needs to do their homework."}
{"text":"First timers! Come w/ a great appetite! Great portions! Chef is a proud owner & should be! Great staff & great food! Thx Chef for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Today Im having Drey's Corned Beef Hash with eggs and English muffin and tea good service butt they should of kept some of the Hawaiian dishes"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, the moment you walk in the door they greet you like you're family.

Ordered the Country Fried Steak with eggs and hash brown and it was phenomenal! It was slathered in bacon gravy and was so tender, it made me wish I got another order. 

Decently price and homemade juices, this is definitely one of the best breakfast and lunch place to go!"}
{"text":"We love supporting local businesses and Bite is up at the top of that list!! Consistently amazing, home-made food....exceptional service, and good music playing to top it off! We drive out of our way to dine at Bite- whether it be for breakfast or lunch. Waffles are to die for....Mo's breakfast wrap; healthy and delicious....chipotle chicken wrap; must have. LOVE this place and everyone who runs it. Great people. - and very grateful for repeat customers. Def a fave of my family!"}
{"text":"A favorite place to dine EVERY time I'm visiting Vegas. A minimum of once a week if staying more than 7 days! All the servers are attentive, the food is excellent and quick.  Generous portions so consider a \"go\" box. Try the fresh pressed juices AND the coffee."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant!!! Service is on point, their menu is creative, they have freshly pressed juices and the food is tasty!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday, and I easily got a table for 2. 

The service is wonderful - super friendly and non-intrusive to conversations. 

I ordered the funfetti pancakes, and they were super fluffy. They were sweet but not overly sweet (I didn't eat the whipped cream on top). I enjoyed them as much as one can enjoy pancakes. 

The price is about average. My 3 pancakes were $10. 

Overall, Bite is solid. I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer another place that's a bit cheaper. But I would definitely come back if invited to another brunch."}
{"text":"Went into Bite today & had some of the best breakfast I've ever had the freshly squeezed juice they make is to die for. The best part is, it feels like you're at home the best Vibes. I love the food & the coffee is great food came out fast."}
{"text":"The last time we went there, we received bad service in regards to friendliness from the staff. We walked in and stood by the entrance for 5 minutes, before someone approached us. That staff never smiled nor greeted us, instead said \"table for 2?\" We also saw a female server when we first walked in and she actually looked away when we had eye contact with her! We both felt really disappointed and thought they were cold and rude! I don't think we are returning there again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! They have some really unusual and delicious omelettes. The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place right off of the 215 and Flamingo. I came here with my bf on a Saturday morning. It was pretty dead, which is fine by me. 

Service: the service was pretty good. Out waitress was quick and attentive without being annoying and very sweet at first. Once we got our food she only came around 1 time and that's when we asked for the check. Service was a 4

Food. I ordered the classic French toast combo. Overall I gave it a 3. My French toast was soggy and needed to be cooked longer, and very badly seasoned. The eggs I ordered sunny side up also needed to be cooked a tad longer and came out a little cold, a 3 to that as well. The bacon was great cooked perfectly.

Bf ordered the corn beef hash and eggs. This was amazing! Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. Which I commend them for since it can be hard to season corn beef hash well since the meat can be very salty to begin with so adding extra flavor can be tricky. This dish is a 5 for sure! 

Overall a give 4 stars because while I understand that mistakes happen in the kitchen, however French toast is hard to mess up, the eggs were a disappointment but the corn beef hash was redeeming!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, large servings, & one of the friendliest staffs I've ever encountered. Every single person in this place had a smile from start to finish, no matter what their job entailed. Food is really good & original. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Very great people, food, location and price. I'm happy with the service and like the Biscuits and Gravy. 

I look forward to comming back!"}
{"text":"Nice Bite.. We had a very tasty breakfast. Brisket with scrambled eggs and a pancake stack. Food was above average... The service was a little slow because the place was full of yelpers aka slammed. We will be back for more.. I approve this message JKKUHL."}
{"text":"Really amazing local place for breakfast :-) Food was great, service fast and even fulfilled my wishes of changing the original plate :-) Usually I like to eat clean healthy  meals and sometimes it's hard to find such places. 
Truly recommending :-) And their waitress Bianca was sweetheart ;-)"}
{"text":"Different menu has more of twist from the old one, More youthful face lift to the place , with So Cal beach music playing , just lounge and eat and watch football. Love it"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We ordered the Over the Border Skillet (spicy and full of flavor) Sub Bacon instead of chicken and we got French Toast. This was our first time and we enjoyed every bite. We will be back. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food was excellent. We had the corn beef hash and an omelet... blown away. The service was exceptional. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was great! food was good, and pricing was decent. However, my server was just not so nice..checking out at the register did leave a way better impression, but i don't think I would go back just because of the service I received. Other than that, the food and ambiance were both great! I recommend that you try it, and hope you get the best service possible, at least better service than I did. Food is an A, the juices are really great too, fresh pressed for $7."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!!! Gravy is to die for! Potatoes are perfect! Bacon is thick & juucy. Service is average. Music sucks. For god sakes, turn the AC back to normal. It was freezing in there, even the staff had to wear jackets. Would of loved to be able to enjoy sitting there but it was too uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it falls short in my standards of a breakfast eatery. I've been here 3 times now and have gotten different things to try and so far, none have been appetizing but their hash browns and funfetti pancakes. 

- Huevos Ranchero: 2 stars 
- 2 Egg Meal: 3 stars (You can't really mess that up, though) 
- Bite's Benedict: 2 1/2 stars
- Funfetti Pancakes: 4 stars 

The service here is what is lacking the most, in my opinion. I think some of the employees need to visit a well established restaurant to learn what it means to be in a hospitality business. I came to eat here and one of the servers looked at me for a good 40 seconds and asked \"So, are you ready?\", took my order and just walked away without a thank you or a smile. 

We ordered at 8:46 and it's currently 9:09 and still waiting to get our food... Will update if we wait any longer."}
{"text":"I was very excited about this place, given its stellar reviews... but my husband and I were not impressed. Everything had excessive salt seasoning on it. I got the buffalo wrap with fries... my husband got biscuits and gravy and he tasted them and would not eat them. My wrap was ok but nothing we ordered was good enough for us to be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place.. even tho since it opened up I've gotten the same dish chicken chillaquiles.. which never fail.. very kid friendly and always on point... the staff is very generous and on top of things.."}
{"text":"The Bite was great!  Great service, delicious food! I had a steak sandwich, it came with fries. My son had the lunch option of the stuffed steak, with fries also. Both of us really enjoyed the meal and the service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Lots of choices: I have my faves the Chilaquilles alone or with steak or chicken are excellent:brief description it layers of fries tortillas chips with homemade mashed beans ,cheese, sour cream,salsa and eggs on top I like over easy or basted so the velvety yolk gets all over! But any style eggs work! Basically a form of breakfast nachos! Other faves are huevos rancheros,sweet potato waffles and country style eggs Benedict
Enjoy! As I said lots of tasty options with latin twists!   
P.S. Fresh fruit juices and chips and BITE homemade salsa to go! Must try local  spot"}
{"text":"This was the first spot my husband and I tried for breakfast before moving to Las Vegas and it blew us away. First thing was the super friendly service. Then the fresh squeezed juices and the delicious omelette choices. We have been back again already!"}
{"text":"First time here and the people working there where very friendly. It was busy which I took it that meant it must be good. Small place but roomy enough to be comfortable. I got the eggs Benedict and they where delicious!! My girlfriend got the Ultimate breakfast which is pancakes with eggs inside and crumbled sausage and bacon on top. She enjoyed them immensely. My daughter got an egg wrap and she also enjoyed her dish. Two thumbs up from all of us. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is like going to a friend's house. A friend who happens to have the skills and the kitchen to throw down some good eats. 

The staff have a genuine aim to take care of their patrons as if you're a guest in their home. I like that, vibes like that run through the whole business making it not feel like a business but a place to relax and enjoy some good food. 

It's bright and airy with comfortable seating. Perfect music played at a perfect volume too, a pleasure I rarely encounter. 

I will be back, and probably become a weekly regular."}
{"text":"This place was awsome...the service was great very friendly and the food was good...."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed Pineapple juice was amazing! The brisket omelet was great, meat was full of flavor & so soft. Pancakes were great! I met the owner, he was a sweet heart. Can't wait to try for lunch."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is my favorite, and Bite hits the target.  If you're trying to side whether to come or not, come. It's a great setting and great food."}
{"text":"disappointed that this turned out to be more about gimmicks than good food.  and at 4.5 stars, disappointingly overrated.  maybe 2-3 stars is more appropriate.

Breakfast Steak roll--got the veggie version of it.  the steak was tough, chewy. i should have read that many people thought it was \"chewy.\"  Novel idea that tastes disappointing once you bite into it.

Pancakes--mediocre. a little bit tough and \"wheaty\" in taste. Not delicate or delightful unless you pile butter, fruit, anything on it.

Monte cristo benedict--once again, more about the gimmick than the taste.  I've had some great monte cristo's in the past--this was at the bottom.  The french toast was tough and the hollandaise sauce was seasoned with a paprika that was scented so strong with body odor, i thought it was cumin, not paprika.

I was sad that I drove out for this. Service was brusque but not very flexible."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on the way back to SoCal. Greeted promptly, nice and friendly service. They have a lunch and breakfast menu. There is no breakfast menu for kids but they will make a kids size portion. Daughter went with funfetti pancakes, topped off with whipped cream and infused with sprinkles. The boy had the same chocolate chip pancakes as always. Wife went with French toast. I had the beer pancakes. They were amazing, made with Guinness and full of smoked apple wood bacon. Out of this world delicious! I could barely eat half the order. Added the combo to it for $3 more which included two eggs and choice of sausage, bacon, etc. I will warn you now. You may end up in a food coma. I did not eat the rest of the day. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"So good, a nice fusion. I could have had tea, the gravy from the moco loco and an order of toast and have been so happy! The patty was just a huge bonus. Staff was friendly and accommodating. No pressure and they gave great suggestions."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my little man, who does the great service is awesome we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes were good, I was worried they would come out soggy under a bunch of blueberry sauce but I had worried for nothing. I could have used an extra scoop of butter but I will just make a mental note to myself to ask for it should I ever come again. I may. The side of red potatoes I ordered were really good, but I was disappointed with portion size for the $3 charge, but what can ya do. 

My husband ordered some sort of omelette with hash browns and he inhaled his food. He expressed that they were really good, he liked it. Keep in mind he likes everything, but it did look good. 

I couldn't tell what kind of vibe this restaurant is going for. It looked like it was attempting to be kind of country or hipster (idk the difference between the two haha) but then half of the tables are 50s or 60s dinner style and all of the chairs as well and the other half of tables are just regular brown restaurant tables. Beats me. The floor seriously needed a sweeping, but they were busy so I get it I guess. 

Visited on a Saturday, late morning. It was busy but I feel like thats typical for any breakfast joint, big or small. They were understaffed during my experience here. The host was seating tables, bussing tables, serving tables, helping in the kitchen and being the cashier. He wasn't the only one in there multitasking but he definitely stood out. I don't know his name or the other two servers who helped take care of us because none of them introduced themselves. I felt like there could have been more order as far as organization BUT they were getting the job done and everyone appeared happy so its whatever, yeah? 
 
Worth checking out and judging for yourself."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. I have had many things on the menu and the food is consistently amazing! Some of my favorites are the Country Fried Steak, Chilaquiles, Banana French Toast & Chicken and Waffles. Their fresh press juices are delicious! Service is also really good. It can sometimes be busy, but it is totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. The banana French toast was killer and their fresh guava juice was amazing. Definitely coming back whenever we stop by in Vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing little breakfast place in the Target shopping center off Flamingo. The place is so hard to find that I missed it AND I was looking for it. We came after seeing all of the yelp reviews and the mouth-watering photos of all the food.

Bite serves fresh pressed juices, so I ordered the apple-lemon-ginger juice. It was amazing and came in a cute mason jar. You could tell that it was fresh pressed because of the pulp that would form on the top if it wasn't shaken. That, and we literally saw the employees juicing and filling the mason jar! It was delicious and I had to pace myself not to drink it all in one sip!

I ordered the ultimate pancake breakfast which was unique and delicious. It is 2 or 3 (can't remember) buttermilk pancakes with layers of over-easy eggs in between so that when you cut the pancakes, the egg yoke oozes over the pancakes. OMG so good. There is also bits of bacon and sausage in between the layers of pancake and sprinkled on top for the perfect mix of salty and sweet. It is really the most perfect breakfast. It is a huge, rich, portion and I could have taken it home, although the runny eggs might make for an inedible lunch. I also ordered a side of hash browns (asked for extra crisp) which were good, but not seasoned enough.

My husband ordered the veggie omelette  and a side of roasted potatoes. The omelette he said was just-ok, but the potatoes were out of this world. You could tell they were fresh, seasoned perfectly, and crispy just like I like them.

I will definitely be back, those steak chilaquilles are calling my name!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place a few times, and finally one morning I decided to give it a try. 

I really like the open feel the restaurant has, but in my opinion, the restaurant could benefit from a definite theme. There is a modern like wood mount on the wall... Which I thought was cool. Then on the opposite wall there is a Coca-Cola diner like clock. The kitchen was rather small, which must be why the coffee and soda were placed outside of the kitchen. 

I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice. It was very good and definitely fresh! I ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon, hashbrowns and toast. As I was waiting for my food I could see the guy, who took my order, toasting my bread... Which I thought was kind of weird. Those are things that are supposed to be done in the kitchen where no one can see, I feel like. 

I really liked the thick fluffy toast, and the thick cut bacon. Other than that, the breakfast didn't have a WOW factor for me. My server was very nice and personable though, which is why I give this review four stars. Overall this was a good place to go if you're craving some breakfast food."}
{"text":"Great service! Amazing food! Definitely a place you have to check out! And, the best Orange juice ever!! Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm thoroughly confused by the good ratings. Came here because it's close to my home and had good reviews. Boy were we disappointed food is bland, poor quality meat, over cooked, over fried and over priced. Decor looks half finished. Was completely surprised by our bill at the end of our meal. Way over priced especially for the quality. Honestly felt grossed out leaving here. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service couldve been better and more attentive but overall the food was good.  We come for food and then get an even better experience with service.  We had the funfetti pancakes, caramel pretzel pancake(pretzel was stale), and the monte Christo French toast sandwich.  All with combo which means extra $3 for eggs and bacon.  Meh.  We also had guava juice  served in mason and that was delicious.  Other than that it is not a bad place located off of 215 in the Grand Canyon shopping center."}
{"text":"Really neat little restaurant.  Enjoyed their vegetarian morning wrap and my love enjoyed the Loco Moco. Be sure to select one of the fresh cold-pressed juices."}
{"text":"Service was great!  The waitstaff was very accommodating and never rushed us.  I had the porkbelly & beef burger which was super tasty and not too large of a portion that it's overwhelming.  I tried my friend's Nutella pancake and believe me, I've had my share of Nutella items, but this was one of the tastiest I've ever had.  I'd go back anytime."}
{"text":"Just okay in my opinion. Great location though and it was the only place not packed this Sunday morning. Good service. I had the homemade corned beef and it was.... Okay. The eggs were supposed to be overeasy but they were actually overmedium. I really prefer runny eggs. The hash browns were not crisp and lacked that beautiful golden brown that I usually seek out. They were a thicker type of hash. My entree was $13 which is fine but my portion was small. My friend got country fried steak which was less expensive but was about three times my portions. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal though and his seasoned potatoes seemed spot on. I will definitely try coming back and seeing if I can find something else that I like."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow yelpers, we came to check this place out with a friend right after we moved into the area. Great service and food! The kids had the mint chip pancakes which were excellent! I loved the many choices of pancakes and had trouble picking a dish because they all sounded so good! We will definitely come back to make our way through the menu."}
{"text":"Our first time eating at Bite and it was great. I order omelets at most breakfast spots we visit and Bite's was one of the best I've had.  You could immediately tell the ingredients were fresh. Also, we love supporting local, small businesses and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  Portions were large and came out hot! We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Food: A great breakfast place, we ordered and asked if we can customize some of our meals since since they offer some other carbohydrates with our breakfast meals. I opted for the Spanish rice and my wife wanted to do the Spinach Wrap for her enchilada and they agreed with the changes and came out great. Comparatively better than egg works. The Icing on the cake on our dining experience was the Chicken Fingers it was cooked very well that the taste of chicken defined the meaning of chicken tenders.

Ambiance: The restaurant decor were homey. great for big parties since the tables can be connected. 

Service: The atmosphere and service were very good, there were some misses on the spoon and the water however overall the service was very  good for a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Gave this place another try and I was really disappointed. With respect I don't understand the hyped reviews because I feel like it's so over priced for flavorless food. I got the bites benedict which sounded amazing. This actually had good flavor but the spice and heat killed it. I love spicy food and heat, but this was just overbearing and completely masking any flavor that this meal had. The hash browns were cold and had no notable seasoning or flavor. My boyfriend had a build your own skillet with bell pepper onion cheese sausage and bacon, with cinnamon raisin bread.. skillet was small. Not worth commenting on. Just tasted like a homemade omelette. Raisin bread also lack luster. I got an Arnold Palmer to drink which was $5! I wish I looked before ordering. The whole meal came out to $30. Felt like a kick to the gut since I didn't enjoy anything I ate. In terms of service, our waitress was okay. I've worked in customer service my whole life and was very turned off to see she was on her phone so much. I ignored it until paying my bill. While paying at the counter she was on her phone texting THE ENTIRE TIME. Why is that okay nowadays? Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very cold and windy from A/C. Sat for a while, never even got served a glass of water.  Better places to go in LV."}
{"text":"Good value 
Good service
Great pancakes i had the hazelnut first time
Off the hook!

Really liked the place i would dare to say their pancakes are best in vegas"}
{"text":"Beware! The hours on Yelp are wrong! I even sent a picture but it is still not changed :(

They open at 8:00am daily. We showed up early and had to walk around the parking lot and get exercise before eating, what a bummer! haha

I ordered the Ultimate Pancakes! A nice dose of protein if you count your macros!
It's three pancakes, with (what seems like) an egg in the middle of each and pieces of sausage and bacon right in the center. This would have been plenty for me but I needed to try the corned beef hash after I saw the pictures. Homemade corned beef hash is very hard  to find and Bites is delicious!

Bites Corned beef officially rates #2 in the city next to Jamms. This is not a bad thing because there are about 42 breakfast places that have not been rated or reviewed at all because it simply was not worth the time. (For breakfast and the hash)

My mother ordered the biscuits and gravy. She liked them but thought that the biscuit was a little too hard. I could not get enough biscuits off her plate so I had to order one to go for more \"research\". Once I had it for dinner (the leftover pancakes were lunch) I would say I have to agree. Odd hard biscuit but awesome sausage and bacon gravy.
Bites biscuits still rate #1 in Las Vegas for me.

They were given a 4 for slow coffee service although the waitress was really nice ! (She mentioned the owners are thinking of opening for dinner too, I would totally not oppose this as long as breakfast was all day!)

Will be back. (With or without Mom) ;P"}
{"text":"Quaint little place with friendly service and great food. Many fresh squeezed juices to choose from. Their hash browns are squiggly. Nice place to chill and relax with friends for a little while."}
{"text":"Great breakfast must try the hazelnut pancakes, portion sizes are perfect, real potatoes ! Great hospitality overall great local breakfast spot must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Traditional breakfast offerings but obviously made with talent and passion. Our party of 6 ordered just about everything from the cold pressed juices (amazing!) to chilaquiles, and pancakes. Can't say there was a single disappointment. Very well priced and generous portions. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. I will return frequently! I was very satisfied with my chipotle wrap. Fresh ingredients, awesome flavor..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot + very good burgers

I like that they take traditional breakfast classics and turn them on their ear - great combos.

Had Monte Christo Benedict as well as three pancakes cooked around eggs with bacon and sausage w/ warn syrup.  Had French press coffee also - super yummy"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast place. Seems like they're jumping on the trend of breakfast places that are just that. With minimally decorated insides. They have juice selections and Virgin drinks.. try the Virgin blood Mary.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service! 
3 stars for the food, comparable to Denny's.
2 stars for price. Pretty pricey.
I really wanted a crepe but they were sold out? The only other review about crepes says the same thing. There's also no pictures of crepes on here which leads me to believe they don't actually have crepes. 
My waffle was soft but tasted a touch burned."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Friends and I came in on a Wednesday morning before treating ourselves to a spa day. One of the few places we thought we could find a mimosa early and the reviews looked good. Was informed they were out of champagne, though probably the best part of the meal was the flavored lemonade. Ordered corned beef hash (without eggs), the meat was flavorful but fatty and the hash browns were tasteless. One friend ordered biscuits and gravy (also flavorless). My other friend ordered an omelet that wasn't fully cooked when she cut into it, but ever the optimist, she said she didn't mind over easy eggs. Service was pleasant and there seem to be some regulars present but I'm not sure what they're there for."}
{"text":"A BITE of delight!

I stopped in for a weekend lunch with the girls.  I was in need of something savory.  The decision was easy to order the BLT with fries.  Was it a good choice?  Yep! The bacon was full of flavor.  The bread was dense and thick to hold all of the fresh ingredients inside.  The french fries on the side had a wonderful seasoning generously sprinkled all over.  I would recommend these delicious sticks of heaven.  

The dining area was very plain but still very clean.  The service from Sandra was great.  Our drinks were always filled and were checked on frequently.  Thank you Bite for the quick lunch bite!"}
{"text":"A little expensive. For a burger and fries it was $12.95. The burger was good and juicy but they don't carry pickles! That was disappointing for me. We also tried to order the pulled pork sliders which they were out of. And ended up with a sort of tuna melt that was a good portion size and delicious. But again, it would of been better with pickles."}
{"text":"We come to vegas every February and we always check yelp for reviews found out about bite breakfast lunch and was not disappointed. We had the bbs monte cristo which was very tasty and the bites sruffed breakfast steak, which my other half really enjoyed. Service was superb and the atmosphere relaxed. If you are in the area give it a try as you will not be disappointed. We will be back for the pancakes. Can't wait to try those."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot to come with my clients! There food is packed with bold flavors and great quality. You must get their fresh pressed juice, supper yummy and great for you! Will be back with some more hungry clients after visiting some houses."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Fresh and made to order. Prices a little high, decor lacking, but great service. I hope they were remodeling. The place will probably get better over time."}
{"text":"Come for crazy sugary pancake flavors and attentive service. Our server was friendly and made easy small talk as we finalized our orders. The mint chocolate chip pancakes ($10) weren't quite to my liking but the serving size was huge, the whipped cream was fresh, and my guy enjoyed them. I do wish they weren't so sloppy. 

 Unfortunately, we didn't really care for anything else we ordered. The chipotle hollandaise on the Bite Benedict was thin and runny, rendering the English muffins soggy. Other than the extra spicy chorizo and some bits of jalapeno, nothing else had much flavor. \"The Favorite\" omelet fell short of it's promise- a generous amount of goat cheese and avocado were appreciated but the overall vegetable medley just didn't really work. Sides of hash browns and red potatoes were enjoyed more than our entrees.  

The menu is kind of all over the place and it's hard to get a feel for what they do well. I like that they offer French Press coffee but their fresh-squeezed juices are available at (an over inflated and pretentious-sounding) \"market price\" which I found to be a bizarre marketing choice. Maybe the lunch menu fares better, food-wise."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for brunch while in Vegas. We like local restaurants, and wanted to go somewhere off the strip. Bite did not disappoint! Fresh, delicious brunch with the best OJ I've ever had! Some restaurants just get it - offer unique dishes with fresh ingredients, along with great service. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Food is always good! And their coffee, both the cold brew and regular is amazing! I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Very delicious breakfast. They have fresh squeezed juice. The green juice was perfect. The pancakes fluffy and they serve it with warm maple syrup. The protein omelet very yummy as well."}
{"text":"Wait to order took awhile. They kept missing us but they were very apologetic. Super busy and that's because food is good."}
{"text":"Just average breakfast place, with decent portions. Got the protein omelette which came with hash browns and toast. It tasted great, but nothing special. My dad got the Bite benedict with chorizo. Kind of overwhelming with all the sauce and tasted like a taco. It doesnt matter, but the dining room is kind of ugly. Prices are ok, would give 4 stars but the OJ was almost $5 and never got asked for a refill. Other than that our service was very friendly. They have some competition with the breakfast steak place across the street."}
{"text":"My sister and I shared the Veggie Benedict and the Veggie Chilaquiles with eggs over medium and both were so delicious! We didn't even need to add any seasoning. Everything was perfectly made. The servers were all very kind and helpful. I can find nothing negative to say about our meal. Excellent. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by our newest favorite breakfast place in Vegas.  This was our second trip and was better than the first!  The owner Andrey and server Bianca were so hospitable.  It's so nice to find places that understand good ol' fashioned service.

The food was fresh and flavorful.  The fresh squeezed juices were the perfect start to the day.  We ordered a stack of lemon poppy pancakes as appetizer then enjoyed an amazing meal from the kitchen.  We enjoyed Chicken Fired Chicken, The Favorite Omelette, Stuffed Steak Breakfast and WonderBerry Waffle.  No one was disappointed.

Can't wait to be back!  Oh, and be prepared to share!  

Andrey - well done.  You have a goldmine.  Great food and great staff. 
Bianca - your smile, energy and recommendations were amazing.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Bite was flooding all of my social media outlets with pictures and promises of delicious food. My boyfriend and I went at a weird time. Service was great, since we were one of the only two tables there. I did think it was kind of annoying that they were sweeping the floors--I have issues with dusty floors potentially getting on my food.

Their food concept is interesting; it is essentially Mexican-American brunch food. Although the waiter told us their juices are super popular, we instead settled for the pineapple mojito which came in a cute mason jar. It was delicious and refreshing and perfectly sweet, but I do think it was a little pricey for the amount we got. 

For entrees, we got the Bite benedict and country fried steak. Their benedict had chorizo in it which spiced things up and sets it apart from the typical benedict. But let's be real, chorizo is tasty by itself. The country fried steak was just a big slab of ham. Not bad, but also not special. I did enjoy their hash browns though; they contained green onion which again, sets it apart from the typical hash brown. 

While I applaud their innovative concept and their great social media presence, I think execution fell a little flat. I don't see myself ever craving food from here."}
{"text":"Great food, great iced coffee, good portions. I'd love to have Bite back in Seattle. Service was really attentive as well. What a great way to load up before a hike."}
{"text":"I love my breakfast!! I'm from SoCal and looked up this place...very impressed... You can taste the scratch kitchen made food.. The service was phenomenal. Everyone came and checked up on me. The monte Christo is to die for. Great concept... Will be back again..."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the juice I bought. It was somewhat pricey but worth it because you can tell its fresh. I however was not impressed with the food. My food was just okay my side of toast was slightly burned and to top it off, they only had two types of juice that day which was a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Yumm first time and it was DELISH! My hubby had what he said was the best chicken fried steak he ever had! I had the monte cristo French toast and it was soooo good. Also try the guava juice!!
Oh and the service was GREAT :) everyone was super friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for freshly squeezed juices and breakfast. The service is awesome, but the food can be a little pricy for breakfast. I love their mint chocolate  pancakes and mushroom omlette. I'd highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the neighborhood. Parking is easy to find."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Offers an amazing selection for breakfast. I had the banana pancakes and they were to die for. They bring you this delicious warm syrup. I added eggs and bacon for $2.99. Hubby had a skillet with chicken and switch potatoes for fruit and only for $1 more. Great service"}
{"text":"Came here during my visit to VEGAS!! Got the Spanish omelette and chocolate chip pancakes, yum!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"So... I ordered from here from Uber Eats. I got an Eggs Benedict with potatoes, and... what can I say? The ingredients were all good... except one thing. The hollandaise was not hollandaise. It was like a strange yellow sauce on top of perfectly (I want to mention) poached eggs. Maybe it was just made wrong today, but it tasted nothing like one is supposed to. For one, I was detecting some serious hints of cumin in it and it was under-seasoned. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think this place is really good and I'll order from here again, but I won't be getting anything with hollandaise on it until I know that they have changed the recipe."}
{"text":"Our office ordered 3 steak Chilaquiles plates for our bosses birthday and every single one of our orders had the toughest meat or it was just pure fat, could not bite into 99% of the meat severed. It was so disappointing. We called to warn them about the meat they were serving. We were very nice and someone on the phone said \"I appreciate you, then abruptly hung up\" very rude. Super disappointed and never going back there."}
{"text":"Came to have a Bite before my hiking trip to red rock , gotta admit best breakfast lunch joint in Vegas ! I had the steak chilaquiles this time. Definitely coming back for lunch , service was on point and very friendly , i love the fact they offer breakfast and lunch all day ! Dont get me started on their fresh squeezed OJ!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  The staff are so fast, friendly, and professional, and the food is delicious.  We are so delighted that I was inspired to write a review from the table.  Thanks everybody."}
{"text":"Super cute place!
The staff was more than friendly and really on top of things! They cleared tables faster than I've ever seen before.
Portions are large so go hungry!
The wait for a table wasn't bad at all. 
I had the peanut butter banana french toast and it was amazing!
My partner had the funfetti pancakes and liked them. They come with a dollop of yogurt on top and I'm not to sure about that....She said that they were a bit too sweet but still pretty good.
I can't wait to go back and try more things! The breakfast wraps sound divine!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a few times and today is the day we decided will be our last time. 

Each time the food has changed for not the better. I ordered French toast it was doughy/soggy in the middle, hard on the edge and had a burnt cinnamon taste. Could not even eat one piece. 

Hubby sandwich was ok bacon taste funny. 

Best part of the meal was the fresh pressed juice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Customer service on point with door greetings and table service! Clean and fairly priced. I ordered Will's wrap and a coffee. The coffee was rich and buttery. The spinach wrap with bacon sausage cheese tomato onion and egg was delightful. Cooked perfectly! The salsa Verde was salty and tangy, with a fresh green herbal flavor, and left a slow gentle burn. All in all...I loved it!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a coworker (who frequents this restaurant) was recognized by the owner while we were at work.  TJ, my coworker, was raving about the chorizo chilaquiles and steak & eggs so I decided to swing by today.  I am a huge chilaquiles fan so I ordered it with chicken, it was delicious! The green verde sauce they pair with it was soooo good! My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles and had nothing but good things to say about his dish.  BUT the REAL winner of our meal was the churro French-toast.    We got the flight of their most popular options and that one was by far the most delicious. It tasted just like a churro, but more like the inside of it (where's its the gooiest and really soft)!  We paired it all with classic mimosas (they have quite a few different flavor options which all sound good). 
They also have an awesome AYCE menu that is tapas style, well def be back to try that in the future!

Thank you Andrey for your hospitality. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try if your looking for a breakfast/lunch place in the Southwest area!

My favorite dish:

-LEMON POPPY SEED Pancakes! They are just the perfect mix! Light & fluffy just how I like! Also for the lemon flavor is not overwhelming which is a plus. Also the fresh squeezed OJ is refreshing as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here through Ubereats. Took 30 minutes to be delivered. I looked on my Maps app and the place is 11 minutes away. Upon opening my bag, so excited to devour my breakfast, there were no napkins or utensils. Just a straw for my juice. My sourdough bread was soggy and the house potatoes were severely undercooked. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about bite so I decided to try it on a Saturday when the family was up early. Luckily they do call ahead seating so that is a major perk bc I didn't know how busy they would on a Saturday around 9:30. When I called they said they would put my name down for a party of 6. When we got there we were promptly seating bc it wast that busy yet, but literally after we were seated and got the kids all situated the place was packed. The service was excellent. Every staff member that interacted with our table was so friendly and attentive. 

I ordered the fresh brewed iced tea and the hubby got the coffee and fresh squeeze oj. Everything was delicious and you can tell it's made fresh. 

I ordered the country fried steak and eggs. First off I love country fried steak. This was not a county fried steak. It looked like it when it was served but upon first cut, it was literally a breaded fried steak. The steak was not cubed or tenderized. I asked for my hash browns crispy and the cook literally made them crispy like potato chips. I couldn't even eat them with a fork bc they were so crispy. The taste was good and the serving size was good but I think the disappointment of not having a country fried steak threw me off. 

My mom ordered the churro French toast and absolutely loved it. She's been there before and has previously ordered it and said it was consistent  in taste ok both visits. 

My daughters ordered the biscuits and gravy. Nothing outstanding but was good. Very big portions and filling.  

The hubs ordered the regular French toast platter. And my toddler ordered the kids pancake with bacon sub for eggs. 

I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here but would go again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"First time here!! We came from acrossed town on a word of mouth we have to try this place out!! 
Well it is in a shopping strip so it is small. When we first walked in we were greeted with a smile and seated. Immediately we were given menus and asked what we would like to drink.
The place is cute, small, clean and busy.. They are only open for breakfast and lunch closing at 3pm. 
We went Memorial Day Weekened. They were super busy but, fast, attentive, food awesome and nice.
We both had Mint Chocolate Chip Pancakes combo. 3 huge pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 bacon or sausage!!
It was scrumptious and we brought half home!
They have lots of breakfast items and sandwiches for lunch and even pressed coffees almond milk and fresh pressed juices
Get it a try we will be back"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had sub par service and the food wasn't that great. I got the eggs benedict and just wasn't impressed. My hash browns were barely cooked and the hollandaise sauce was not what I was expecting. The service may have just been because it was Sunday morning and it seemed as though they were under staffed.  I'd say try it out for yourself, you may love it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for breakfast today. 

Walking up we saw a sign saying \"Cash Only\".  We were slightly put off after having to go to the bank before returning. 

At 10:30 AM on a Sunday there was no wait.  Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. 

I ordered a side of the Churro French Toast with my Chiliquiles (vegetarian, without meat) and egg whites. Churro French Toast should be the ONLY way to make French Toast. I was soooo good, it has ruined me forever for French Toast served any other way.  It was soft in the center and crunchy around the edges and smothered in cinnamon and sugar. In a great way, It's so sweet that syrup would be overkill.  The chiliquiles were very good as well. 

My husband had the corned beef and thought it was good. Honestly the best thing we had was the French Toast. 

After speaking with the waiter about the cash only sign he said it's only a temporary thing. They were having trouble with their credit card machines and are installing a new POS system. He asked to give them a month, and they should be accepting cards again."}
{"text":"I don't give a lot of 5's but this place is pretty awesome.

Nutella pancakes 4.5/5: probably one of my favs. the middle of the pancakes were loaded with nuts. A little too much but still oh so delicious. Oh and that warm syrup! 

Benedicts 4.5/5: my wife loved it and had a perfect kick to it. 

The bacon: 5/5, they found a perfect pig for this one 

OJ 5/5: fresh and absolutely Delicious."}
{"text":"This places is absolutely AWESOME! The owners make everyone feel like family, and the food was absolutely delicious! All homemade and i gotta day, by far the BEST gluten free pancakes on earth! Everything was fresh and flavorful and delicious!!!! Take your family here, you won't regret it-kid friendly and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went to this spot this morning after a terrible hangover. I felt like my head was going to explode and my stomach was eating itself lol. I am gluten intolerant but I looked over the menu, and although a lot of it isn't gluten free, I appreciated the fact that it had a good variety in breakfast options and lunch options. I got myself a fresh coconut for my drink and it came with a thick straw which made me happy since I was able to pick up chunks of coconut as I was drinking it. I went with the huevos rancheros with the green sauce. The plate was huge and super filling. The fried tortillas were crisped perfectly and not super soggy from oil or the sauce like it usually is when I order it at most other places. Everything from the eggs, the beans, and the spanish rice were cooked perfectly. Alongside the rice and beans it comes with a side of lettuce with tomatoes, onions, and diced jalapeño which was all fresh. I HATE when breakfast places serve jarred jalapeños. It's gross and I really appreciate that they give you fresh jalapeños. I overall enjoyed my meal, and I'm eager to come back again. The place wasn't packed and loud which was another plus, and the cherry on top was that when I walked in, they were playing music that was making my head hurt more but right when I sat down and told my server I was hungry and hungover, they started playing some good reggae music lol. My only complaint is that I wish they had more gluten free options and that they were open longer. Other than that, I was satisfied with the food and service and I'm excited for a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Good indie place for solid breakfast.  Coffee is strong and good.  Everything I have had so far has been good...from make your own skillet, corned beef hash, and biscuits and gravy.  You can tell the majority of the food is made in house.  My only minor gripe is service can be a bit hit and miss considering one person takes your order, another looks after drinks, and another delivers your toast.  My toast has been forgotten more than once which is a easy fix, but not great."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We love the array of fresh fruit juices, especially the pineapple juice. The burgers, fries, and wraps were also scrumptious! We can't wait to try out their breakfasts."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas! Food is amazing and customer service is wonderful.  I had the breakfast steak omelet and strawberry mint lemonade and was satisfied with every BE of it!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it's so simple plays a great music and the food is actually good the staff is nice and very very very very attentive so there's no way you should go without getting your needs met in a sufficient amount of time while you're being serviced in there I would return here"}
{"text":"Small little breakfast spot with very eclectic menu and great food! Staff was friendly and outgoing. I don't live on this side of town but I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast.  We were staying near by and stopped in for breakfast.  The staff is friendly and the food was tasty.  We ordered a couple of the scrambles, waffles and pancakes.  The portions are large, so bring your appetite.  The kids really enjoyed the raspberry lemonade.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to giving Bite a try after seeing their great reviews, unfortunately it was not meant to be. 

Called this morning to place a takeout order after the gym - tried to order their Bianca wrap and was told it's no longer on the menu. It was listed on the PDF menu on Yelp (but not on their website menu). Okay, no problem, I know this happens sometimes where both menus aren't updated. 

Looked at the website menu, called back to order the Moe's wrap and was told they no longer serve any breakfast wraps. Huh? 

I finally gave up and placed an order at Squeeze In."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast in Vegas!  The waffle has flavor, they have applesmoked thick bacon  the eggs are cooked to perfection and the service is excellent - I think there would be long lines if they were located in downtown summerlin wow excellent breakfast! Thank you Bite"}
{"text":"Now this place is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas it's in a strip mall off the strip so it's nothing fancy inside but the price are good and the food is phenomenal I had the corned beef hash and it was the best I've ever had and the wait staff is exceptional my coffee cup was never empty and they were super friendly"}
{"text":"This place is a hit#! Very creative and delicious food...a place to eat every time you in town..and if yah live here....then what you waiting for:)"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try a new brunch place and I found Bite on yelp.  Our experience started out great but didn't end so well. We were greeted right away by the first server. A second person took our drink orders and brought them out and 3rd server took our food order. We sat outside so no one really checked on us and had to go inside and ask for more coffee.  I have to say the fresh orange and pineapple juice was amazing. So 45 minutes later we got our food but not all at the same time. The food was also really good but small portions compared to other brunch places in town.  So when it came time to paying, we were told they don't take credit or debit cards but they have an ATM Machine inside that can be used which charges a fee....this was really upsetting since we were never told. What if we didn't have cash? I mean it's 2017 who doesn't take cards?! Even my personal trainer who's a one man business takes credit cards....needles to say, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"To preface this, I am reviewing a delivery order. I had gone out the night before to see Run the Jewels at Brooklyn Bowl. Needless to say, I stayed out late, woke up late, and had zero desire to cook, go outside, or wear a bra to be able to go outside. But I really wanted pancakes and hadn't restocked on eggs or milk. Enter, Bite... 

Not only did I get pancakes, I got THREE flavors, thanks to the pancake flight. I expected little baby pancakes, but was pleased to find a one full-sized of each that I ordered. Considering I ordered a second entree for myself, I realized I was on the verge of a \"couch potato morning binge\". Anyway, I ordered confetti, chocolate chip/banana/pancake, and buttermilk. The second pancake was my favorite. Given the travel time, they were still warm; maybe not as fluffy, but they did the job. 

My second entree was steak chilaquiles. Bomb. The steak was tender and juicy. I ordered a fried egg due to the travel time but I can imagine the dish being even better with runny yolk.

We also ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  I thought it could be more crisp, but it was otherwise great tasting. It was then that we discovered that though my husband doesn't like canned corned beef hash (which is not what Bite serves), he also doesn't like real corned beef in corned beef hash. Go figure. Nothing against Bite's version. 

However, the star of the meal, and perhaps the breakfast menu, are the churro waffles. I expected a cinnamon-sugar waffle, but these bad boys are literally a waffled churro. You get the bite and chewiness of a churro with crispy waffled ridges all coated in cinnamon-sugar. Move over Costco churros... 

I can't speak fully to service since I stayed home in my sweatpants. However, I had difficulty ordering one plain pancake. I selected the one that looked closest. The restaurant called shortly after my order was placed to explain that I couldn't get mile high pancakes (stack of 5 buttermilk pancakes) in the flight, but that they could give me one buttermilk pancake. I appreciated the call to make sure we both had the same expectations. 

Someday, I may find the energy to go outside for pancakes. Until then, I enjoyed this delivery."}
{"text":"Awesome food, big portions, and the best service you could ask for. I'll be back! When I saw the portions I thought I'd take half home but I couldn't help but eat the whole thing. The Chiquilas were on point."}
{"text":"Our first visit here thanks to Yelpers. We like to try new breakfast joints and this did not disappoint. Fresh squeezed pineapple juice and apple, ginger, lemon juices were fantastic. The steak chilaquilles, and wonder berry Belgian waffle with their warm maple syrup was super yummy. Service was super fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food. Some really unique breakfast items, but still lots of traditional items too. I had the Bite Ultimate pancake which combined eggs, pancakes and sausage/ bacon. They serve it with warm maple syrup. Really good. My wife ordered bacon and eggs. They were cooked properly, and she enjoyed the potatoes. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing! The service was good, although slightly frantic. But the food didn't suffer. We'll be back. Curious to try lunch. The chef/ owner grinds his own burger patties. Love that!

We've been back several times and it doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Off the hook! Looked up best breakfast in Vegas, and they did not fall short! \"The Favorite Omelet\" was the bizness! My dudes \"Ultimate Pancake\"  was off the heezy! And the \"hazelnut pancake\" was bomb! 

Was greeted so nicely when we walked in and our server Christina was the sweetest ever! Made sure we knew all our options and never forgot about us kickin' it in the corner! 

Two thumbs up! I'd give it four thumbs up if I had that many. And also if they had home-made jam/jelly!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town. Do yourself a favor and bring your favorite people here to eat"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because the food was amazing...

The only turn off, which was kind of huge is when we left my girl and I smelled like the kitchen in a bad way for the whole entire day my clothes, hair everything just smelled like a top grill...

As for the food, we ordered the loco mock and one of this wrap steak breakfast and both dishes were amazing!!! Very unique in flavor and not over salted! 

Love the food! I will definitely be back to get take out."}
{"text":"The assortment of exquisite bottomless mimosas, the fresh and yummy food - pleasing both the eye and the palate and the impeccable customer service made this an excellent choice for our New Year's Eve brunch while visiting Vegas. Even the music is perfect. 
And since we live in SoCal and visit here often, this place will definitely be our go-to for brunch every time we come."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good considering it's a breakfast place and this area is saturated with them. I had the funfetti pancakes which were really good, although I wish it had some sort of cream cheese glaze or sweet syrup to go with it. My husband had the biscuits and gravy. From what I tasted the gravy was good and I liked that the biscuits were a little sweet so you go sweet and savory on your plate. I also ordered a side of bacon and enjoyed the fact their bacon is real bacon and they cook it thoroughly so it's nice and crispy- I hate soggy bacon! However, my husband ordered a \"fresh squeezed juice\" and it honestly just tasted like Tropicana orange juice. When we told our waitress she was insist it was fresh but also offered him to try a different juice so I applaud her for good costumer service but I know he won't be ordering a $4.50 juice again. I ordered coffee and was surprised when I was offered a variety of creamers, I like choices and the fact that they offer them to you and HAVE them is awesome. 
The service was great, very friendly and attentive. 
I wish there was more decor the inside just looks a little bland. But overall I enjoyed the food and the service! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try a new place for breakfast and this place was very delicious.   My wife had the chicken chilaquiles and I made my own omelet.  We got an extra scrambled egg for the baby for only a 1.50.  Bianca was our server and she was pleasent, attentive and got our food out quick. We will definitely be coming here again. :)"}
{"text":"This by far is my favorite breakfast spot I come here often with my family. The service is always fast and they never get our complicated orders wrong.  love the Funfetti pancakes and skillet omelets. Their options of fresh juices always confuse me since they are all good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great service!  Very friendly and helpful workers, great food, hip atmosphere. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I honestly had a pretty terrible time here. When I sat down they immediately told me that they didn't have crepes, waffles, or potatoes. They didn't have most of their menu available, especially the breakfast foods. Which is funny because the place is called \"Breakfast & Lunch\". I wanted to leave but I gave them a chance because I saw all the great reviews. I ordered the Steak & Eggs and chose to have my steak cooked medium rare. However when I got the steak it was completely dry. I really wish I was exaggerating about that. I don't even know how you can make a dry medium rare steak. It was a total disappointment. Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.  The inside is pretty utilitarian with only about 20 tables and there really isn't any ambiance.  However, once you try the food you don't care about how the cafe looks. The menu has many choices for any taste and appetite.  I love pancakes,so I tried the regular pancake combo with eggs and bacon. The pancakes were plate sized. They were perfectly cooked and delicious. The eggs and bacon were also cooled as I had ordered.  The wait staff is young and a little inexperienced, but attentive."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place a my son and i came in on his spring break...the food choices were very good to choose from on the menu.  Atmosphere is good small and family like...my only real complaint is that they were out of orange juice, apple juice and its sorta loud cause the ceilings are high and it echoed the screaming babies...all in all the service was great food was just as good and I'd order the ultimate pancakes if you like eggs, pancakes,with bacon and sausage...wish them much success!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Looking forward to making this a regular stop for breakfast.  The fresh juice was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Their restaurant sign outside is adorable. The service was amazing, our waiter was very friendly. The food was good as well. My boyfriend and I got pancakes which have been the best pancakes I've had, and the best part is that they give you your own syrup bottle that has been warmed. It's a more intimate breakfast place than the other breakfast restaurants I've been to, which I appreciated. I would have given 5 stars but the meals were just slightly a bit more costly than I would have liked to pay for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Everyone was very friendly. They have some awesome cold pressed juices. The guava one was my favorite. 

I ordered the Banana Walnut Pancakes since they were out of the French toast version. It was a little dry, and the owner was kind to give a card telling us our next order of pancakes would be free! Love that he did this!"}
{"text":"This place is a little scattered. I ate here a couple of months ago and the environment felt off because they seem understaffed.
Someone rushed up to me to seat me but didn't know where because a party was expected, so we had a to wait a few minutes.
I got my food but wasn't sure if it was mine because only one item in my order was correct, which was the steak, but it wasn't even cooked to the temp I asked.
Then I had to wait a while to get my check, a long while, because like I said, they appear to be understaffed.
The food tasted alright. Overall, the place needs some work."}
{"text":"Such sweet people cute little mom and pops place. Love the food our favorite is the hazelnut pancake!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at bite with my girlfriend. We came in intending to eat eggs Benedict. I ordered the Southern Benedict, which was $11. I did not taste the gravy at all--it had no flavor. The hash browns were mushy, plain, and undercooked. My eggs were overcooked and not runny for an eggs Benedict. My girlfriend ordered the classic Benedict and her eggs were cooked just fine, but her hash browns were undercooked and mushy as well. 

The service was good, they checked on our table and the food came out quick."}
{"text":"Great food and vibe.  Amazing service!  Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast we have had in Vegas. Service was excellent - Carlos was our server. He catered to everyone (8 of us) and made sure everything was perfect. 

Kids' breakfasts - lots of food for the price. Our kids enjoyed everything.  The pancakes are pure perfection.  Taste is a cross between a pancake batter and cake. Warm syrup to top them with. 

Adults had a make your own omelette- ham, bell pepper, onion with Bite hash browns (delicious); chocolate chip pancakes; Addiction was their version of eggs Benedict with a great tasting hollandaise sauce. The bacon and sausage had a great flavor. 

This place is worth the drive from downtown.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely worth the wait:)

We had a very good burger with an egg on top it's called the Gatsby burger and we really liked it! 

We shared our meals... Chilaquiles... Great!!!! Next time I will order the chips a little more crispy but they were deliciously flavorful. They come with a some avocado (great for fiber, potassium & more) 

We finished the meal with a green chocolate chip mint pancake with whipped cream on top. The only thing that would've made that better would be vanilla ice cream.  

We spoke with the owner & he was extremely kind & interested in being of service. Our waitress was Maria & she was very nice & gave us really attentive service! 

She suggested their fresh juices & we enjoyed a nice cool jug of fresh squeezed Apple juice. She said the green juice is excellent & a fan fav. 

Happy to have \"Bite\" in our neighborhood.  It is a great way to start the day"}
{"text":"Awesomeness is to say the least. Great service. Yummy food. Tasty and fresh juices. Cute and roomie place. We ordered the NY steak & eggs, the Monte Cristo, The Favorite, & The Crimini....all fantastic! Their apple, lemon ginger juice was very refreshing!"}
{"text":"I wanted something different, not just a boring ordinary breakfast and vegetarian friendly, this place has something for everyone. I ordered their special omelette with spinach, goat cheese and sundried tomato, a little runny in the middle but still good, next time I will ask them to cook it a little more but overall it was good. Friendly staff and it was very clean!"}
{"text":"We just had to walk out of this place. 

Truthfully, we've had mixed experiences here. The first time the food was mediocre (couldn't even tell you what I'd ordered). 

Last time it was good (monte cristo Benedict). 

Today, after waiting 40 minutes (literally 40 minutes, not an exaggeration) we had to leave. 

I'm starving now, so I'm pretty pissed. 

After taking our order, the server dude disappeared. He never came back. 

Finally we got up to leave and asked to pay for our drinks. Then he was troubled enough to check on our order. 

He said it was ready (too bad he didn't check sooner). 

We won't be back. 

There  are too many breakfast places to waste our time or money here."}
{"text":"Cute place to grab breakfast. Food is great! The best part of the whole experience was the amazing customer service. Kristina was awesome her passion for service is unbelievable. Great attitude very attentive to all of her tables."}
{"text":"Came here because I found out my favorite server from Stacks and Yolks works here now. Dude has always been A1 with me and my family so it was great to get great service again. Things have really went down hill at Stacks since dude left. 

Arrived around 10:30am and had no issues getting a table. When I walked in everyone greeted me like I was a long time customer even though this was my first visit. The guys shook my hand as if I was an old buddy of theirs. I know I knew the server Gil from the other restaurant but the rest of the staff still made me feel super welcome. 

Ordered our drinks and they were at our table instantly. Checked out the menu but my heart was already set in the Chicken Fried Steak which was recommended to my by my friend. Rest of my party ordered Huevos Ranchero's, Banana Nut Pancakes and some Sausage and Eggs. Food came out quick but our serve was still checking on us to see if we needed anything else. Drink refills were almost automatic and my request for extra napkins and jelly were handled lightning quick. 

Food quality was extra bomb. You could taste everything was freshly made. The sauces and gravy had that homemade taste that most restaurants lack. The Chicken Fried Steak was actually steak not those processed breaded meat patties you find At some other places. The green sauce and red sauce on the Huevos was like liquid crack, I almost asked for an order of sauce to go just so I could use it as a base for my own culinary creations lol. Pancakes tasted like banana through and through, not just like regular pancakes with some chopped up bananas on top. Hash browns and Country Potatoes were nice and crisp and the eggs were cooked just right, not all stiff or runny like other places. Basically I had a really good experience and my breakfast was bomb dot com. 

To sum up my visit I will say this.... I'll be back (Arnold voice)"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere! The food is amazing and I will definitely be returning. The banana nut French toast is delicious and I will absolutely be recommending this place to friends and family. 

Thanks for a great first experience!!"}
{"text":"We came to eat at The Bite due to them having 4.5 stars. They honestly deserve a full 5! Service is great and food is Amazing! Definitely a great pick!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here. Food was delish, servers are friendly, parking was accessible and it's priced right.."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/lunch for me. Walking into this place you are welcomed by the staff right away, which was nice. We were seated right away. The restaurant is very clean and we'll laid out. They even have purse hooks under the table so you don't have to set it on the floor. 

I started off with the Razzle Dazzle mimosa. It was really fantastic tasting. You could taste the champagne but it was not overwhelming. Very cool concept with the names of the drinks, each one I wanted to try as they all sounded good! 

I had the chicken fingers for lunch and it was good. The real deal was the flights of food. My parents both had specific flights. One had French toast that I tired all of it and everything was equally as good. My dad had the pancake flight and that was good too!

I'm super impressed on how the staff of this restaurant runs, the food, and of course the drink options. The owner is one of the nicest guys and takes the time to talk to you. If you haven't checked it out yet please run over and do so!"}
{"text":"This breakfast/lunch spot is pretty decent. Their menu contains a wide array of choices from omelettes to decadent pancakes. I have to admit- I didn't look at the lunch menu much.
I've been here in the past and I felt the vibe back then was more \"organic pressed juice\". It seems to have evolved into more that that, which I can appreciate. This time around, I opted for the hazelnut pancakes which were pretty delicious. I did upgrade to the combo and was a bit disappointed that I got two wimpy pieces of bacon instead of nice, thick slices. 
Bathrooms were clean and very well maintained- which was a plus for a mom like me who has to be eye to eye with the toilet while holding my 2 year old over it. 
Service was fast. Our server checked in a few times, which was great. I also like that you pay up front instead of having to wait around for your check/your server to ring you out. 
If ever in the area again, I would return and maybe explore the lunch menu!"}
{"text":"The BEST buttermilk pancake I have ever had! The biscuits and gravy is very good as well. I will definitely come back here again!!"}
{"text":"I went here 4 weekends in a row - it is that good!

I have tried the crunchy cinnamon raisin french toast, and a variety of pancakes including: lemon poppy, cinnamon apple and sweet potato! All were delicious and my favorite is definitely the sweet potato! The pancakes are very light, fluffy and I love a splash of cinnamon in my pancakes!

I also came in for the tofu tacos for lunch and they were very tasty!

Special Note: They have various fresh juices made and put inside a mason jar which you can choose to pay a little extra to take home. I always have to get my fresh guava juice, which is very addicting!

The service is awesome and always accommodates to try and make sure my food does not cross contaminate with other food (like meat).

We love this place and the fact that they have so many vegetarian options! 

However, the bf has ordered the fried chicken with eggs every time and can't get enough!

We'll be back. ;)"}
{"text":"Called to see of there was a wait and the man said no..gave him my name said I was on my way and he said great we have a table reserved. Get there and we wait about 3 min before someone actually acknowledges us (even though about 4 employees literally walked right in front of us), we were told it would be just a minute they need to clear a table (but we could clearly see there was NO empty tables so which one she was going to clear was a mystery)... Was told again by another employee it would be just another minute....after about 15 minutes we just walked out. 

We called, left a name and then waited almost a total of 25 min...only to be ignored, lied to and leave super irritated. 

Horrible!"}
{"text":"I ordered a skillet and  the corn breaded chicken and waffles.
Have you ever ordered breakfast foods and after you ate it your stomach would hurt because of all the oils from cooking with eggs and pan frying everything. Well with these skillets it isn't like that.
They're nice and flavorful and sizzling hot like a good skillet should be. Everything super fresh and believe me you can tell. The chicken and waffles were nice and fluffy. Portion size is pretty big too so that's also a plus.
Orange juice was great and their drinks come in cute mason jars. Also their customer service is overtop great :)
Really enjoyed this place and will definitely  will be back again."}
{"text":"Very fast service. We had breakfast within 45 from walking in to paying even on a busy Sunday morning. Food was ok. I had a Mexican omelet that had good verde salsa but bland chicken. Husband had a Monte Cristo waffle that looked interesting and tasted good too. The space was very basic. This place is good for a quick in and out breakfast."}
{"text":"Loving this breakfast joint! Saw the sign for fresh juices and couldn't help myself. Got the apple lemon ginger, which is amazing. They have the juices made in mason jars in their cooler thing, but they ran out of what I wanted and made it fresh for me! How lucky am I? Perfect balance of flavors and so healthy! 

And he Nutella pancake... Yum! Great texture and fluffiness. Fresh hazelnuts along with banana and Nutella.

Even their coffee is good. It's not the regular watered down cafe stuff. Plus they offer flavored creamers.

Also got the BYO Omelette which is good, but nothing special.

Overall, friendly and fast service. Clean restaurant. Great food and fresh juice. I'd say 4.5 stars if I could :)

Must try. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had to update, because they got me. I came back today just for the orange juice even despite the market price. Yummy yummy yummy. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot!!! Ivan is a rock star. He forgot my coffee... brought it over 5m later and took it off my bill no questions asked. Awesome quality food. Highly recommend corn beef hash!!!"}
{"text":"Best Monte Crisco I've had in Las Vegas this far!!! Employees are awesome
Very friendly"}
{"text":"Great food and the service was perfect, laid back environment with music. I would highly recommend giving this place a try! I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"5 stars. A must try. My new breakfast spot from now on. First off I have to give a shout out to the phenominal service! Ivan is a fantastic server, he's fast efficient and really funny. That alone makes me want to come back.

Now on to the best part... the menu! Bite has a very diverse menu that offers something for everyone. There are several customizable vegan options available. For nondairy options soy and almond milk are available.  

They offer a variety of juices that are fresh squeezed. I tried the orange juice and it really is delicious. For the same price that other places charged for watered down juice the fresh option here is killer.

I ordered apple cinnamon cakes and a side of hash browns dry (no butter) my boyfriend steak chili kitas and 2 coffees. Wow!! We ate for 5 mins without talking it was so good. All of the ingredients are freshness you can taste. Real fruit is used not synthetic filling.

Absolutely amazing. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I could split these reviews into one for service and one for food. The service I received here was top-notch, and if I could I would give it FIVE STARS. Our server's name was Carlos (...I think. He was fantastic but I'm awful with names; I'm sorry.)

However, my food was just okay. I ordered the Monte Cristo Benedict, and while the eggs were perfectly cooked, the french toast underneath was soggy and flavorless. The meat on the benedict is ham and not the Canadian bacon that I am used to, and the maple syrup overpowered the savory notes that I had been expecting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular either...almost like a bunch of breakfast foods had been piled on top of each other. 

If you're hungry, you'll definitely leave full. Next time I'm nearby I'll try a different dish though."}
{"text":"Awesome little breakfast/lunch spot. The fresh pressed juices are amazing and the portions are generous. I was won over by the sweet potato pancakes! The service was also great. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was craving a really great eggs Benedict but I got something neither horrible or great. It was ok. I was literally the only person in the restaurant the entire time I was eating and that's always a little suspect. It would have been better if the hollandaise sauce would have been good but it almost had a curry or smoked flavor to it that didn't float my boat at all. I doubt I'll be back since this place isn't in my side of town and I was just killing time while running errands."}
{"text":"When I think of Bite, I think of two words: pretty pancakes.

I saw a picture of Bite's mint chocolate chip pancakes in the Yelp newsletter, and within a week I was there. The restaurant is located in pretty busy shopping center off of 215 and Flamingo. I had to drive around the lot for a few minutes before I actually found the restaurant. 

Per our server's recommendation, I ordered the hazelnut pancakes. The were just pancakes with a little drizzle of Nutella and hazelnuts sprinkled on top. Something you can easily recreate in your kitchen. I received bacon and eggs with my meal, which were standard - nothing fancy. My meal was around $13, which isn't horrible, but you can receive something tastier at iHop for half the price.
 
If you want to support a local business or breakfast in a quiet location, then this is your spot! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is the service. Everyone is over the top friendly. They all give the impression that they are genuinely happy that you came in to eat. I really couldn't say enough about how impressive the service is. It's that good. 

The food is great too. I had the jalapeño omelette and loved it, though the best part may have been the hash browns on the side. Ask for them crispy. Tried the Apple Lemon Ginger juice. Excellent with a hint of raspberry. $7 \"market price\" was a bit pricy for juice, but much better than my $8 Coke at Hakkasan so it's all relative I guess."}
{"text":"Just went to Bite for the 3rd time. All 3 times I have been, they said they didn't have any crepes. This time they also didn't have waffles. A few minutes after ordering, they said they were only taking cash today. Maybe it's my fault for not seeing the sign on the door, but that's not something I have a habit of looking for. 

I have no complaints about the food I've ordered here. I love the different kinds of pancakes. Which is why I was taking my son there for the first time. Unfortunately, I wasn't carrying cash and refused to walk around the corner and pay an ATM fee just to have breakfast. 

Bottom line the food is good, but you can't bank on them having what you want, or being able to accept your business if you're not a cash carrier. Good menu but has the markings of a poorly run business. Very disappointed after my visit today."}
{"text":"Yelped this place because we wanted a brunch place to try. Went on a weekday so it wasn't busy.. always a plus when trying a new place.

I got the omelet and side of fruit with my mimosa and he got the country fried steak. Both were mediocre.. nothing where we're \"WOWWED\" about it though. It was just ok and not as satisfying as I had hoped. Maybe I just picked the wrong item to try that day."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a drive for us, but it is worth it. We usually don't have to wait to be seated, and service is a breeze. The staff there are really nice. We've had so much on their menu: pancakes, french toast, omelets, corned beef hash. You name it. The food is consistently good and we just love it. We'll be back for sure.

Edit, 9/01/17: I initially gave this place 4 stars, but upped it to 5 stars. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Didn't love it food wasn't great, took forever to come out, the plates were bring hot as if they were sitting under heat lamp for a long time

The banana bread French toast was pretty gross

Juice was decent , overpriced"}
{"text":"Get the peanut butter banana French toast! So good and filling!! They fill those bad boys with enough peanut butter.  Also got the Nutella pancakes and they make their pancakes just right.  Good fluffiness and right amount of Nutella and bananas.  For the saltiness also got the chorizo Benedictus with hash browns.  All portions were generous and made to order.  The service was great and our waiter was friendly and accommodating.  I would recommend for anyone that is a breakfast lover and wants to fill up.  Go Bite!"}
{"text":"Place is very delicious portions are very reasonable, prices are reasonable also overall I fell in love staff was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu and very friendly and attentive staff. The Mint Chocolate Chip pancakes are delicious and spot on with flavor. If you love burgers indulge in The Gatsby Burger it will definitely satisfy your  carnivorous appetite.  Don't forget to try the fresh pressed Guava juice which is on point."}
{"text":"The only thing I'm upset about, is how long it took my husband and I to find this spot. 
Great food and amazing service. 
We will be back again for sure, with friends. 
Owner was touching tables which I thought was such a special touch. Very nice guy. Excited about the possibility of extended hours because it will give us more chances to come. Prices were moderate to high for breakfast food but We received such great service, I didn't mind."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I talked my husband into trying this newish restaurant near our house. AMAZING! He had the strawberry pancakes and the strawberries were perfectly ripe and sweet. 
I had the chicken and waffles... The only downside for me was that the breading was a little heavily seasoned. I took the breading off one side and it was perfect. I chose the buttermilk waffle (yum) but they also have a cornbread waffle I want to try next time. My 6 yr old loved the funfetti pancakes and he got the kids size which is three smaller pancakes. My 10 year old had the classic buttermilk waffle with butter pecan ice cream and chocolate drizzle (he ate the whole thing).  Wonderful breakfast and this was the first visit of many to come! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ended my long term relationship with The Cracked Egg after visiting and falling in love with the gravy here.  We love everything about Bite and reading some of the negative reviews left on Yelp really hurts!  

Things to order:
1) Country Benedict
2) Chicken & Eggs
3) Chicken & Cornbread Waffle w/ side of gravy (trust me, gravy+syrup+fried chicken+waffle is an unhealthy mouth explosion)
4) ANYTHING with their gravy
5) Moe's wrap (without gravy when you're trying to give your arteries a break)
6) Lemonades 

I really didn't care for the pineapple mojito, but the lemonades are awesome.  Consistency on how chicken is battered or gravy taste/color can sometimes vary, but it is not detrimental to the quality or deliciousness of the meal.  Also, if you love avocado you will find Bite to be extremely generous!  My boyfriend really likes the skillets/omelets, but this isn't his Yelp account :)  

It's true that sometimes you have to wait, but you have to remember that the servers are regular people, too!  The owner is great (remembers our names & so friendly) and if you ever have a problem with your food, send it back and they'll fix it no problem!  Remember that they close at 3pm... breakfast traffic is typically heavier between 9:30am and 11am.  

Love this place and hope it continues to do well!"}
{"text":"Really good food, great service,  the juices are awesome.  Now.... for us it was pricey, food and juices over 100 for a lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Bite a few weeks ago via yelp and we're glad we did! We've come here for breakfast easily 10 times since finding it. 

The restaurant has a cozy and relaxed vibe and I can't say enough about the service, everyone is extremely friendly and prompt. They are very aware of the costumer and remembered us as soon as the second visit. 

Highly recommend trying their fresh squeezed juices and lemonades. I am particular to the jalapeño and cilantro lemonade. It's fresh and refreshing with a subtle kick of spice. The food is fresh and consistent. We've tried a lot of the menu and I haven't come across something I don't like. My favorite however is the some like it hot omelette with potatoes and sub my toast for one of their flavorful pancakes. 

Only thing that would make them better are more vegetarian/vegan options :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a lunch date to celebrate our 5th year anniversary.  We looked on Yelp and saw this place had great reviews so we thought to give it a try.  My wife had the chicken, mushroom, cheese crepe and I had the oh la la which is the strawberry cream cheese french toast.  We also had the bananas foster crepe.  Everything we tried were delicious!  Carlos was our server and he was on it.  There was another lady there but I didn't catch her name, she was really spot on as well.  Not only did we enjoy our meal but the staff was very good and also shared some laughs.  Definitely recommend this.  Would be a great brunch place after Sunday service."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, the staff was very friendly and the price was ok. I didn't get the same 4-5-5 star feeling and taste as many did, I think it was really just average, but I am giving them 4 cause the staff was very nice and accommodating. I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but I won't be craving it."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and personable, the server is cute and bubbly, and the food is NEVER a let down!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to apologize to my wife as I have found a new love... the Ultimate Pancake here at Bite. I'm not going to go and say this as useful for civilization as the wheel, but it is a contender. Putting eggs, bacon, and sausage in the middle of fluffy buttermilk pancakes is indeed as good as it sounds. They even brought the syrup in a freshly cleaned warmed up bottle. Service was stellar. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely a ways of a drive, but it was worth it. The chilaquiles hit the spot. I was a little sad that they ran out of the fresh pressed green juice but I tried the Apple lemon ginger and it was okay. Very tart. The friends I was with also seemed to enjoy their food. Our server was also really awesome."}
{"text":"Womp womp womp..... why oh why is it so hard to find a good breakfast spot on this side of town!?!?
Ok first off, you should know this is a CASH ONLY business. 
The restaurant looks and feels blah. I walked in and wanted to turn around and walk out. There was only one other table there! And come to find out, they were from out of town.... so we were the only locals there. Ok, so I ordered a coffee and never got it until our food came out. Which I never even got to finish a cup, yet was charged for it. Very nice.
The corn beef hash was such a let down. It was so dry and way over cooked just like my toast.
My friend ordered an omelet with egg whites. Well it was a yellow omelette.... she just ate it. 
Yeah, we ended up paying the bill, tipping the poor guy $5 because we felt bad and thought maybe that's all he will make all day and went next door and ate. I just don't get how everything could go so wrong when we were the only people getting serviced??? Because that other table already had ordered their food before we walked in!"}
{"text":"Went with my friend on a neighbors recommendation. We were greeted immediately and offered something to drink.  The waiter was very courteous and friendly.   She had banana nut french toast and I had huevos rancheros. ...absolutely delicious!  The salsa on my eggs had just the right heat.   The service was excellent!!  We will definitely be back to try their lunch."}
{"text":"Stuff steak highly recommend. Appetizers really good too and hand squeeze juice on point. Server took care of us like family, best service ever from Carlos. Quick friendly and cleared up all my questions. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place I've ever been too. Not is only the food amazing, but the customer service and the hospitality is above and beyond. I highly recommend it , you wouldn't be disappointed & super impressed! :) btw, I'm not a person to usually Yelp but this place amazed me that it deserved the best review !!"}
{"text":"The beer pancakes are yummy! with the pieces of tasty good bacon , the portion is pretty big and they serve them with warm syrup.
I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"So I wasn't even looking for this place and it was right  there just quietly waiting. For just under 20 dollars I had a well seasoned steak rapped around grilled onions and mushrooms. Took up half the plate. Perfectly cooked. I've had my share of expensive steaks. Yeah way awesome.  The opinion of fries over a salad did this right for me. I'm on a lunch break and I don't have time. It came fast and felt like a dinner date. To bad I was alone. Come and enjoy. They are also on the west coast in LA. Thats home for me so I will be back to that location soon. Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best service and food. Staff members treat you like they know you but I think they really know me already because I come here almost every weekend. I recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"I had got them delivered on Grubhub. They were absolutely amazing!  Their croutons are 100% addicting and they taste amazing. Their salad was wonderful. So was their pancakes! I would totally recommend them to anyone who asked for a delicious breakfast/lunch place!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing find.  It's in a plaza so it doesn't get much street traffic but people fine their way here because of the Real food and let's not forget the coffee.   They cook their corn beef for four hours fresh every day nothing out of a can.  It's served with slow cooked potatoes with fresh herbs and spices that gives their dishes a refreshing fresh flavor.  The owner is from Columbia and serves some of the best coffee in town.  The prices are spot on but you might have to call ahead on the weekends because they do get a little busy."}
{"text":"If you looking for a great brunch place to eat! Def try this place out! They have so many options for a meat eater like me or even a vegetarian like my sister! You will not be disappointed! Food is delicious and the staff is so Friendly!!! Everyone helps each other out and you will never have to ask for a refill! Everyone is on point!!!! Est. is clean as well. They won my vote!"}
{"text":"Second visit to Bite and another 5 star review.  A small wait to get seated, but not too long for a Sunday morning.  This time I ordered the Monte Cristo Benedict.  Everything was cooked perfect, but just a little too sweet for my palate.  That being said, not going to blame it on them.  What did I expect, it is after all a Monte Cristo Benedict.  My fault, not theirs.  

My girlfriend had the hazelnut pancakes.  Could only finish about half of them, but she loved them.  Not a pancake guy myself, but did try one bite and do have to say they were quite good.  Pancake was thick, fluffy and had enough chew to stand up to the Nutella and maple syrup on top.  Not to mention the whipped cream and bananas.  Most pancakes would have been an after thought with all the toppings, not these.  The actual pancakes were still the star of the show.  

Overall, another great visit to Bite.  Good food, friendly staff and a nice atmosphere.  We'll be back again, especially if she gets an itch for pancakes again.  Only disappointment was they didn't offer red velvet, which is her favorite."}
{"text":"Country Fried Steak & Chilaquiles...  Absolutely delicious!  Friendly waiters and servers.  Will be back for sure.  Everything tasted great, seriously."}
{"text":"Service and food were great.  I tried the Banana Walnut pancakes which were terrific.  I would go back and try other items from their menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Truly disappointing service. Put in a to go order and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. Get there, I'm told they're out of the banana nut French toast. They said they tried to call me and I didn't see this, that's fine, but a voicemail could've been left so I could've seen that and called them back. I also didn't get a discount or anything for the inconvenience. I am then waiting for my food for 20 minutes. Finally get my food and I get to my car and check it since they didn't show me, my huevos rancheros come with beans and there were none. I went back inside and stated this and they wanted me to go and grab my food out of the car to show them before giving me a side. I'm sorry, but I've already had a crappy experience, give me the side of beans that come with my order I don't understand. They give them to me without me getting my damn order, but I put a picture to show there were none. We leave and there is also no side of syrup for the French toast we got. Again, delicious food. But that was just a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I had the hazel walnut Nutella pancake combo, it was amazing, and I also tried their pineapple juice. It was also very good. Highly recommend this place for breakfast or a cute brunch."}
{"text":"I wasn't completely impressed by this restaurant. The servers were friendly but it doesn't seem like the servers have sections. First one server asked us if we were ready and we said we needed a few more minutes, then another server came by 2 minutes later to ask if we were ready and we said no, then 2 minutes later our original server came by. 

Honestly I wasn't too impressed by the menu as well. I ended up just getting a grilled cheese. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Delicious. Everything I had here was delicious. The fresh squeezed OJ was great. The ultimate pancakes I had were perfectly cooked and the fried potatoes were probably my favorite part of the meal. I wanted to try the hash browns, but they were out. Unfortunate, but a very clever way to get me to come back. The service was prompt and friendly. The only problem is the \"seat yourself\" policy. When we arrived every table was taken and there was nobody around to give us an idea of how long the wait would be, but there's a sitting area for such an occasion. We got a table pretty quickly, but I still think a host would make it less of a guessing game for customers."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were leaving the hair salon nearby and wanted something to eat. We popped in to Bite and weren't disappointed.
I am a breakfast food lover, but decided to have the spinach salad instead. It was fresh and delicious-perfect! My daughter had chicken strips and fries from the regular menu. Just like most children, she loves her chicken strips. Her meal came with homemade ranch dressing that I had to try and it was delicious. Everything we ate was freshly made and the wait for our food was short. The owner made us feel at home. We were happy to have found this place and will be back again, I must try the funfetti pancakes!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town, and the food is consistently good. Love the music playing also :-)"}
{"text":"not as great as I hoped but good none-the less. i will go back for sure. Menu was interesting"}
{"text":"Good food nice staff....  Nice to see a little bit of a dif menu for breakfast vs the traditional fried foods....  They have those as well if your interested!  But def like the variety."}
{"text":"Excellent service, I got the peanut butter pancakes combo. Bacon and eggs were great, excellent coffee! Not too bad at all, I would say 4 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"We really wanted to try some place new. After reading all of the reviews, we decided we would drive across town (30 minutes) to try Bite. We were thoroughly disappointed The service was okay. After we received our food we didn't see our server again until it was time to pay. The juice was listed at one price but crossed out, to our surprise it ended up being $7 (ridiculous) and definitely was not worth it. I ended up getting the Monte Cristo. Yuck! The french toast had no flavor, no matter how much syrup I added. I normally go to Babystacks and definitely should have stuck to my routine and skipped this place. Save your time and money. Despite the other reviews, this place isn't nearly as good as people are claiming."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas, I come here with my friends every chance I get! The service in this sweet, tastey joint is perfect. I used to come before I stopped eating meat and the food was ah-mazing! But they do have great vegetarian options as well. I usually get a veggie skillet or I'll switch it up with some cakes, either way you can't go wrong! But my favorite thing about this place is they play reggae!! Ah, great service, great food and reggae...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Finally found a great breakfast place close to home. Great service too! Real corn beef and hash and banana nut French toast....yummo."}
{"text":"Service alone is 5 stars!!!! The food is delicious and the lemonades are refreshing!!! Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Pros:  good service (server was friendly and filled our cups often), tasty food, nice selection of breakfast and lunch items, reasonably priced and clean setting

Cons:  our waffle was a bit dry so we had to drench it with syrup, not really a big deal but wanted to point that out

Overall, a solid breakfast and lunch place, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ellen F. suggested this place and after reading many reviews on it we decided to go check it out. The picture from Antonia R. of the Monte Cristo also looked badass and to be honest I am not a breakfast person at all. It's tucked away in the shopping center located on Flamingo and Grand Canyon on the south side. 

You walk in and it's an open dining area with larger tables off to the side against the wall and the rest of the space has round tables with 4 chairs. First thing that really caught my eye was the silverware, damn it was shiny! I don't know if it's because it's brand new or they do something special with it, who knows still cool to look at and eat with. 

I ordered the Monte Cristo of course and had a glass of water with lemon. I always order it with lemon and usually half the time they forget it or its a lil slice thing that you can't do shit with. They brought out huge slices of lemon that more than sufficed, other places need to copy their lemon protocol. The server was very friendly when taking my order and came with my food promptly. 

Now I thought the Monte Cristo at Canters in LA was the best I've had but after trying this I have to honestly say I prefer the one here. There not stingy with the ham and cheese and you can still taste the egg, it doesn't get lost in the mess like it does other places. THEY HEAT UP THE SYRUP! I know it's not that serious but warm syrup with Monte Cristo goes together rather well. Every time I was low on water to waiter came by and filled up my glass without asking, which I like unless I'm done eating. 

All in all it was a pleasant experience and enjoyed the food, will be returning soon."}
{"text":"The Ultimate Pancake dish is mouth watering, delicious.  I'm not a pancake lover but took a chance with this.  There were sausage and bacon pieces and egg white chunks throughout (I requsted egg whites) and it was the best pancake I've ever had. Perfect mix of salty/sweet! 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply modern, comfortable, cozy but most importantly delicious.

On the cons: it is cash only. But that won't stop me from returning a thousand times over.

Beware of the breakfast \"WET BURRITO\", it can be addictive."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was awesome and food was bomb! Love the hash browns and lemon apple ginger juice. And the banana bread French toast was delish!"}
{"text":"Bite me, am I dreaming? 

There is no shortage of breakfast and brunch joints in Vegas, but do any of them offer up exceptionally great service, no wait and an overall inventive and scrumptious menu offering? Yeah, I didn't think so until I met Bite LV! 

We arrived at about 12:45 pm on a Saturday (prime brunch time), they weren't busy and we were seated immediately. We opted to order 2 popular items that we peeped many mouthwatering pictures of on yelp - that's right, we got the:

Ultimate pancakes! ($13.95) - 3 eggs surrounded by buttermilk pancake batter with bacon and sausage pieces! Once you cut into the pancake the yolk just runs out like nobody's business and soaks into the delicious fluffy pancake batter. It was a generous sized portion and honestly would have satisfied my fiancé and I just fine. Baby, these are the real deal all-in-one breakfast. Flavor: 5/5

Stuffed french toast Monte Cristo with turkey, thick sliced ham, fried egg, & melty swiss cheese! ($10.49) - it is a whopping sized monte cristo style sandwich served with butter on the side (!) It doesn't even need the butter, trust. However, a dip of syrup was a great compliment to the French toast. This decadent beast was hard to pick up so it may turn into a knife and fork situation. Definitely a hearty way to start your day. Flavor: 4/5

Our awesome server also freshly \"hand\" squeezed our orange juice! The juice was naturally sweet and refreshing - so good! Too many places take fresh OJ for granted nowadays. Such a shame. Flavor: 5/5

It's hard to find breakfast joints that get it and I'm so glad that Bite gets us!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Staff is great and the food is always on point. I have never been disappointed. They also have fresh cold pressed juices which are my favorite. Def check them out."}
{"text":"Good but not great

Ordered:

Corned beef -  really good quality corned beef but I prefer the fatty chopped kind that they fry to a crisp.  And I'd recommend u ask for crispy hash browns because the steam from the corned beef on top makes it mushy 

BBS monte cristo- flavors were not really good.  The han especially just tasted like blah deli meat.

They were out of the stuffed steak.  I think I'd come back and give it one try and would order ultimate pancakes and stuffed steak"}
{"text":"First time here. Delish!! Nice surprise. The waitress was awesome and the food was really tasty. Will definitely go back! And best fries ever!!!"}
{"text":"This place is medicore at best. I had the steak rollup and it was bland and dry. My spouse had the steak and eggs and was also bland and it was a cheap cut so it was chewy. Not worth 40 dollars for 2 people."}
{"text":"Breakfast time with the boys at work had a loco moco with the raisin bread in the raspberry lemonade everything was amazing it was cooked perfectly seasoned great the staff is great I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"Meh....we are locals here and wanted to grab a bite for breakfast, saw the reviews and had to try. Place was dead at 9am on a Thursday. A+ here for menu creativity. Too bad the service and the food doesn't back it up. We had the egg Benedict and stuffed steak with hash. Food was actually pretty good but the creativity on the plate lacking. Felt like was missing something, some pico with the steak or some garnish or something. Server was good but not real friendly. Asked her what the popular items on the menu were and looked put out by having to explain things. Never came to refill the water or ask if we needed another hot chocolate. Got the feeling as if she was the owners daughter and she had better things to be doing.

Not sure if ownership has changed, the interior signs look different from the pics earlier. Really want to give this place another shot, we'll see. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit here for breakfast. I took others advice and ordered churro French toast both times and it is aaaaaamazing. Super cinnamony-sugary, melt in your mouth dessert for breakfast. The huevos rancheros are flavorful. The chicken fried steak is a bit bland and needs hot sauce, pepper and salt added for flavor. The omelet on the other hand was a bit over cooked and dry. Not enough cheese and probably cooked on too high heat. Coffee is hot and fresh and they frequently refill your mug. I will return here to satisfy my sweet tooth with the churro French toast."}
{"text":"YAAAAAASSSSSS!!!! been here like 10'times its time to shout out this place....

PROS
waffles were LIT....Pancakes were FUEGO....Orange juice was all natural and better than my mamas....take me back i wana eat everything on the menu! Waitresses were nice to look at and they always on it... Definitely going back... Shoutout to the cooks everything is always cooked just right everytime they deserve a raise! Bathrooms are always clean another big plus.....

CONS
place could use a lil more creative design or decor pretty basic atmosphere......another thing I wasnt feeling too much the \"tip jar\" for the cooks next ro the reguster  is a lil too thirsty and tacky my opinion.....also when is \"DINNER\" menu coming been seeing that sign for weeks and nothing... looking forward to that..."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Delicious food, perfect service. Big portion and the price was just right, and they gave me a big cup of coffee to go. 10/10 would dine here again!!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the food we ordered was very tasty my son had their mint chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream and I devoured the homemade corned beef hash!!! I did ask for a taste of their hollandaise it was broken and like many breakfast places in Vegas it wasn't a classic hollandaise :("}
{"text":"There were lots of problems at Bite today. The only reason I'm giving three stars instead of two is because the staff was very nice and at least handled every issue quickly. The greeting situation seemed disjointed and confused. They could really use more organization. I actually think the issues are easily fixable. I was there on a busy Sunday morning.

Overall the location is good but the restaurant itself could use a deep cleaning. Doesn't appear to be well maintained and gives it a run down feeling. I had to wait quite a bit to get offered a drink and even then the coffee was cold. Once I got a hot cup it was very solid coffee. Similarly it took a while to have someone take my order. I ordered chicken and waffles. When it came out the chicken was crispy and hot but the waffles ice cold. So I had to flag someone down again but they quickly took care of it and replaced it. Then it was good. Everyone there is nice and they are trying but I noticed a few people around me noticed the disorganization too. They didn't seem understaffed. Just get better organized, more careful cleaning and quality control and it's a 4.5 or 5 star place."}
{"text":"Bite being so close to us a good thing because we love breakfast food ! The portion of the food is good and the huevos al la Mexicana is delicious. Our waiter Carlos was awesome and super nice !"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out after reading all the excellent reviews. I was not impressed at all. The place is well-lit, the service was fine and the menu offers a wide variety of options but the food was not good. 

I ordered \"The Favorite\" omelette AND the \"Crunchy Cinnamon Raison\" french toast (both got such high compliments on here) The omelette comes with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach- none of which was cut or chopped making it unpleasant to eat. The omelette was not seasoned and there wasn't any goat cheese (even though the menu lists that as an ingredient). The hash browns that come with it were not crunchy (very disappointing) and were also not seasoned. The French toast looked sooo good but unfortunately, it was wasn't crunchy like the menu claims. 

It's not the worst breakfast I've had but I would not come back to eat here."}
{"text":"breakfast was great with a lot of variety!
very friendly staff
nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast I had! Turkey bacon and eggs with awesome potatoes. The highlight though was my chunky monkey pancake and the delicious fresh squeezed orange juice! I'm so full and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Is this place just all hype?

I was really hoping this place would be amazing and even called to see how long the wait was.  We came in on a Friday around 1pm with one other person and there was literally just one other group in there eating.  We waited in front for a good long while since there was nobody working in front to greet us.  Finally a girl came out and told us to grab our own menus and to sit wherever.  

Once we sat, waters were given to us.  We're from Orange County and it was our first time here.  She didn't really go over the menu with us.  She kinda just was like \"Are you ready?\".  We asked for a moment.  Once we were ready the waitress came to take our order.  She was rude.  She was really rushing our order.  For example, we ordered the Bite's Corn Beef Hash and a Will's Morning Wrap.  For the Corn Beef Hash, we had the option of white or wheat bread.  She would only ask or answer in one word and would never look at us.  WTF?!  She would speak quickly after us.  It was weird.  I don't even know why she was rushing us when we were at that time the ONLY customers in the entire place.  Annoying.

The corn beef hash arrived with some toast and strawberry jam.  The corn beef was a pretty good portion with lots of meat, hash browns on bottom and a fried egg on top.  I didn't think it was anything special.  The Will's morning wrap had the option of regular tortilla or spinach.  We went with spinach.  It also came out with a side of salsa.  The wrap was huge.  It was pretty dry tasting though and also nothing impressive.  

Our total was $21 there.  Besides breakfast items they also had their lunch menu.  As for service, like I have mentioned before, pretty bad.  She didn't come once to check up on us.  She also kept disappearing while we were there.  We didn't see her much until another co worker guy of hers came in to work.  So basically no service.  We actually drove all the way out her from the strip to try their food.  Never again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. After reading the reviews my expectations may have been too high for this mediocre breakfast joint. 
I got the Bite Benedict which is a mexi-style Benedict with chipotle hollandaise, chorizo, and pico on top. The \"pico\" was just onions, two pieces of tomato, and a mound of jalapeños. Under the poached egg there was another MOUND of jalapeños. I love spicy stuff but this was overkill. There was no balance in this dish... more like a spicy punch to my GI system. On top of that, the red potatoes that came with it were over cooked and under seasoned. 
My boyfriend got their \"signature stuffed steak\" which is simply a flank steak rolled around some eggs. Very lack-luster. It had decent flavor but for something that's a signature, you would think it was more refined. 
The service was okay. The wait was minimal. The ambiance was decent. 

Honestly probably won't choose to eat at Bite again."}
{"text":"Hands down the breakfast spot in all of Las Vegas. Every time I am in town, I always make it a point to stop in for some breakfast. The food is always amazing and consistent. You can tell the love they put into all of the food they make. My favorite dish is definitely the chicken and waffles, with the warm maple syrup that comes in a glass bottle, perfect match. The owner Andrey is an amazing person, very personable and makes sure all of his customers are well taken care of. He will introduce himself to every table and remembers your name the next time you come back. Definitely check out Bite if you are in the area, it's worth the ten minute drive off the strip!"}
{"text":"I have visited Bite twice now and both times have been amazing! Generally, the food is fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. This last visit we had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Wonder Berry Belgian waffle with a side of Applewood Bacon. I have never been to a breakfast spot where I received fresh bacon right off the pan! That detail alone made me so happy! 

The restaurant is intimate, but I have always gotten great service. Drinks are refilled promptly and so far we have not had to wait for a table. We have not visited for lunch but highly recommend for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for breakfast. They don't have the largest portions actually on smaller side. Good food but if you are really hungry I'd probably find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food has no salt! Bland bland bland bland bland! I have never salted my food this much in my life. I usually only salt my eggs, but I had to salt my eggs, SEASONED potatoes, and chicken fried steak! Wth! The food looked so good, but it did not taste as good as it looked at all! The gravy still had that raw flour taste to it. Gross! I didn't like how they seasoned the chicken fried steak with cumin! No! \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\"! I was playing it safe since it was my first time, but they messed it up! 

I came here because it had such good reviews. I don't know what everyone else was tasting or thinking, but I think they should get their taste buds checked. 

I'm only giving it two stars because the waitress was nice and they have fresh squeezed juices. That's it."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I decided to give Bite a try after we burnt out on breakfast buffets on our weekend stay in Vegas.

The food was as delicious as it looks, but we did have a slight issue with our server.

Everyone from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave is very nice. Asking how your day is, your meal is, did you enjoy it, etc. I love the fresh squeezed juices, such an easy thing to do goes a long way. The OJ was bomb, but not as amazing as the raspberry lemonade chalk full of fresh raspberries. They even were considerate enough to ask what type of flavor creamer we wanted with our coffee. Little touches like that go a long way.

My husband had the corned beef hash. He asked for a side of biscuit and gravy and the server said \"Well, I can do english muffin and gravy\". My husband looked confused, like why can't he get what he asked for? In the end, it was worked out and he was really pleased with his meal.

My son ordered a chocolate chip pancake. Normally it comes as a 3 stack, he can barely eat one. Again, she looked confused as to if she could do that. We explained that we don't like to waste for what we know won't be eaten, so just bring one. We ordered without whip cream, and it came with whip, however, they were quick to fix.

I had the chicken and waffle. The chicken was outstanding. The waffle was...just ok. I heard the table next to me say the same thing. I prefer my waffle very crispy, and it was doughy. When you add syrup to that, it just made a big mushy mess. I think maybe they just need to rework the batter a little.

Other than the few miscommunications, they have the right idea with their menu. Great flavors with fresh ingredients.

Thanks for breaking us out of our buffet rut!"}
{"text":"Good food and the price wasn't to far out the normal prices. The fresh squeezed juices are really good though. If you go you should definitely try them."}
{"text":"Simply perfect!!
The food is excellent in every way. Even when busy, it's well worth the wait. You can't go wrong with any meal you order. Highly recommend \"chilaquiles\" with over medium eggs (sunny side up) & chorizo."}
{"text":"Found a great new restaurant for breakfast and lunch, Pam and I split their flat iron skirt steak roll stuffed with eggs, chorizo served with sliced avacado home style potatoes and home made salsa.  The best breakfast I've had in Vegas bar none!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot, big menu. Food was good, fast service. Everyone was very nice. Only thing that was a let down was oj was out (guy said they were freshly squeezed) by 1030. Other than that def a good spot to go to."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, nice selection on the menu, good music, clean and bright eating area."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a pleasant breakfast here this morning.  It's super hard to top my favorite breakfast place blueberry hill but it's definitely in my top 5. 

Service: 5/5
Outstanding.  Kristina was cheerful and attentive.  Coffee and water refills never had to be asked for because they were on top of it! 

Food: 4/5
Very satisfying.   I had  the special of the day. Cornbread chicken and waffles. Delicious and huge portion.  My husband had cornbeef and hash eggs over easy and came with English muffin.  Lots of onions in his meal. Flavored creamer offered for coffee. 

Value: 3/5
Two breakfasts, two coffee and one orange juice $40. Hummmm before tip.  

Overall super glad I came.  Would recommend breakfast to others. Didn't have to wait for a table for a Sunday at 1000am.  I look forward to trying their pancakes next time."}
{"text":"I am seriously in LOVE with this place. The breakfast here is amazing and never seems to disappoint. I've tried just about everything, but if I had to choose.. my favorite thing on the menu is the huevos rancheros with half green and half red sauce. All the pressed juice taste super fresh as well. The customer service is unbelievable and always making me feel welcomed. I saw on a review that it is a cash only place, but that is a lie so don't worry about that."}
{"text":"NOT FOR KIDS. No kids menu and no tolerance for children. 
We were rudely treated by one of their staff I am not sure if he is the manager or owner or who he was but he was making annoyed faces at my 19 months daughter for not being in her chair while waiting for food and not only he made faces he came to ask for us to keep her in the chair . I understand you have to be careful having a kid wander around but honestly this is the first time we've been treated this way in a restaurant we eat out 4-5 times a week. my daughter loves to walk up to tables around and greet people. I think you should have a bit of patience when dealing with kids and dealing with customers."}
{"text":"I had the Banana Walnut French toast with a side of scrambled eggs, applewood smoked bacon and oj. Not only did it come out in a timely manner but the food was to die for!! And the orange juice was so fresh as if they just plucked the oranges!! I will definitely be coming back because the food, staff, and the restaurant were amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the family friendly atmosphere! The staff, from the owner and beyond, are always welcoming and happy to serve! It's an added bonus to the great food! I love, love, love the favorite skillet and fresh pressed guava juice! The pancakes and waffles are great too!"}
{"text":"So this is my second ever visit to Bite and I must say still easily a 5 star rating! I would eat at that restaurant more regularly if they had one in the northwest! The staff is amazing super nice, the atmosphere is laid back and very Comfortable, and the food is to die for! They were paying island reggae this day, one of my favorite music types. I am not sure if that's the ongoing theme but this day the music choice was on point ! We also got the opportunity to meet the owner super super nice guy who made every one of his customers feel special by going around talking to them. 
Now to the nitty and gritty...the food!!! Let me start off by saying, do not miss out on the pancakes. You will not be disappointed, any flavor is good. On this particular day we got the birthday cake and the lemon poppy wow, wow, wow! They both were so delicious and both gave two totally different flavor concept, totally recommend. My friend got a breakfast skillet and she loved it, and I went with a make your own omelette and it was cooked perfectly and a great size! Anything on the menu you can't go wrong with...seriously!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday (Sunday) and the place was packed! I tried the funfetti pancakes and my girlfriend had the peanut butter and banana waffles. Both were delicious and huge portions. Although the food was good, the service was stellar. The guys running the place were all super cute and on top of stuff- like seriously better than anywhere I've ever been. Even though they were slammed with people they were getting people in and out so quickly! 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came around 9am on a Saturday and we were seated immediately.  They've got a fun menu of some classic breakfast dishes reimagined and updated with some cool flavors.  Like waffles? why not make it a churro waffle?  a fan of eggs Benedict?  go ahead and grab that signature bite Benedict which features some pork and salsa."}
{"text":"Great portions with amazing food. It was our first time here and I'm so happy we decided to come try it out! My husband got the mint chocolate chip pancakes and he said they taste just like mint chocolate chip ice cream but warm! He loved them! I got the BBS Monte Cristo Benedict sandwich and it was amazing!!! Service was great. Deft will be back :)"}
{"text":"To preface, I really wanted to eat at Lulu's for breakfast, but it was already so late in the morning that we didn't feel like driving so far north, so we ended up here. Maybe it was the expectations of delicious, delicious Lulu's that this place really paled in comparison to. 

They occupy the previous Pasta Fresh place, which I think was also riddled with the same problems as this business. Set-up is very simple and they have a wall with one larger TV showing kids shows, and two smaller TVs on another wall showing sports. We received our menus, which as other reviewers have mentioned, were a bit all over the place. The font and coloring doesn't make it an easy read. Server #1 gave us the low down on the menu and recommended the juices. We still weren't ready to order, so he gave us some time. Server #2 took our order as we ordered the green juice, the Southern Benedict with hash browns and the Chicken Fried Steak with red potatoes. Server #3 delivered our food, and I pointed out to her that the Southern Benedict came with red potatoes, as opposed to the hash browns my husband ordered. She said no problem, called to the kitchen to give us a side of hash browns, and we never heard from her or saw those hash browns again. I think this may be a problem with their multi-server system. Although its nice to flag anyone down, it lacks accountability and follow-up and puts the onus on the customer to update you when something is and is still not right. 

The green juice we ordered was very refreshing and tasty. They only had \"market price\" on the menu, which was a bit weird to me. It came out to $8, but I think they should either be proactive with pricing or have set prices. Even well-established juice places in the area are able to price out their juices consistently or at least advertise pricing. I do wonder though if its just a bit of kale in there and a whole lot of pineapple juice. It was really, really sweet, that's what made it so good. They aren't obligated to put ingredients in order of content like other juice places, so if you're looking for a healthier drink, maybe ask to clarify how much \"green\" actually goes into it. 

The meals we got were not very good. I love salty things, to the point where I could just snack on coarse sea salt all day, but their red seasoned potatoes were overly salted, even for me. I had to take a big gulp of water every time I had a bite and I didn't even both using ketchup (which is weird for me, I put ketchup on everything). I depleted my water fast, and no one came to refill our waters. The chicken fried steak did not have that crispy crust I'm accustomed to at other breakfast places, but the over-easy eggs were made well and added much needed flavor to the gravy. It also came with toast, I opted for cinnamon raisin bread. The bread came out pre-buttered, but was done very sparsely. The bread was also very dry and hard, and at the end of the meal, I just had a pile of crumbled tough pieces. Seriously, they messed up toast. Maybe we should have ordered a more \"sweet\" breakfast, since that's what everyone else seems to be raving about. I would rather eat at a place where I could get quality savory dishes as well though. Paying was a bit awkward and unclear. We didn't know if we needed to go up to the front since no one told us or handed us our check (and this is after we already got our to go box). We finally flagged someone down who said they could give us our check, but we still would have to pay up front. Server #3 was handling the register, but since we didn't have any check to give her, she was confused at what table we came from (makes sense, since she forgot our hash browns), so she had to ask server #2 our table # and if our order was right. 

Just like Pasta Fresh, they clearly have a lot of fans who love their food and I hope they do well, but for me, breakfast ended up being $40.. and I'd rather spend that money on better service and food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I choose the corned beef hash, it was delicious. My friends got the country fried steak and Bite's Addiction Benedict, everything was yummy. Did I mean I got a table immediately? Only reason this isn't 5 Star is there wasn't  any waffles or crepes available. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Music is great
Good is good too
Staff is welcoming 
Their Belgian waffle is to die for 
Little seeds grow into big trees
Happy holidays"}
{"text":"Had the Hazelnut Banana pancakes and it was so fluffy and delicious. Perfect texture and great taste! Service was great. Servers continued checking on us and always refilled our coffee without having to ask. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood gem! 
Fast friendly service! When my waiter brought me my food he was so polite and said \"we appreciate you.\"
I had an omelette. Fabulous. Clean food, not greasy or heavy. I also had one of the cold pressed juices. Refreshing and satisfying. I went the healthy route with this visit, but I will be back to try one of the many sweet breakfast items on the menu! A sweet potato waffle!? Yes, please."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed because my boyfriend and I came here for brunch and my order ended up being wrong. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros that comes with chicken and they didn't finish preparing my order because there was no chicken. I was so hungry I didn't realize it until my boyfriend brought it to my attention that my order looked small as if it were missing something. I'm a little annoyed that the server didn't notice that my order wasn't complete when I'm sure he serves this dish quite frequently. I wish I would have realize it when I was there now I'm annoyed I paid $40 for my check and tipped. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"This was a very tasty breakfast. My husband and I had the pancake sampler which was delicious. Eggs and bacon cooked very well. We will be going back to try there lunch. Very good service!"}
{"text":"Crazy little delicious hole-in-the-wall spots like this make me LOVE Las Vegas more and more with every discovery!

In my attempts to find a new place to try for breakfast, I saw Bite, and all the great Yelps. It was SOOOOOOO Goood!! I was told everything is made fresh and from scratch. I could really taste the love! And the staff was amazing. Greeted the minute I walked in the door, really friendly, and right on it! Coffee refills, water never went below a 1/2 way. I was impressed!

The adorable waiter who helped us recommended the Chorizo Benedict, it was fabulous. A little bit of heat but not super hot. It was really good. Ordered a side of sausage as well, because I am a carnivore through and though! Also really good. The sausage tasted really fresh.

I can't wait to share this place with friends, Bite is a real breakfast find!
And I am so glad, thanks to Yelp, I found it!!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC for both BREAKFAST or Lunch!!! The Montecristo french toast was awesome, off the chain GOOOOD!! You must get the fresh squeezed orange juice OR the applelemon and ginger ginger juice!!!!The service was as good aa the food. The waiters were super cool and attentive to detail despite a busy Sunday morning!! I will be back with more friends and family cause everyone needs a BITE !!!!"}
{"text":"Once again, Bite delivers great food and super attention and service!!  Always greeted by a friendly host/hostess. Immediate seating, very clean and courteous wait staff. 

Food is brought to you fast and hot!
After ordering my food started to read article and read about four paragraphs, my food was at my table, was about warm plate...  Coffee is absolutely tasty!

I will always return.  Try it!!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  Service was slow, took 30 min for breakfast to be served. Not impressed.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak was so over cooked it was damn near impossible to chew. I used a steak knife and it was still hard to cut it up. The hash browns and hazelnut pancake was good though."}
{"text":"I am extremely pleased with my experience with Bite. Service was excellent and food was so delicious!

Their pancakes are amazingly fluffy and not dense at all. I usually judge a breakfast place based on how they make their pancakes. Because seriously, if you can't make good pancakes, why even call yourself a breakfast brunch place. 

The flavors of everything we ordered were spot on! It was so good. I will definitely come back to try their other pancakes.  

I think I may have found the new love of my life!"}
{"text":"Very nice little place. It appears to be a family establishment, as most of the wait staff are quite young and extremely inexperienced. Food is ok, but nothing special. Biscuits and gravy did not have enough gravy, and of course as with any inexperienced cook, the eggs were quite runny. 

Coupled with slow service and the ever present smell of burnt toast, this wasn't a great experience. Think we'll give them another try in about six months so they can get their stuff in one sack. Hope for better then."}
{"text":"I'm not all about brunch places because 1. I can barely get myself up before the afternoon and 2. If I am awake in the early morning, I always want dinner food. 

I ended up eating here, because I just finished an eye exam across the plaza and refused to drive anywhere else to look for food. 
This place was just about full of people wanting breakfast and the employees did a nice job attending to all the customers. 
In a reasonable amount of time, my sister and I got our drinks, our orders taken and a conversation with one of the employees. 
I ordered tea and a server popped out a fancy box of (6?) types of teas that I could choose from. Nice. I dig that haha
I opted for the green tea.

I got the chicken Chilques- tortilla chips loaded with salsa verde, pico de gallo sour cream, cheese, eggs, and a side of beans and rice. I'm sure I'm missing some other ingredients but going off by memory here. 
I couldn't finish half of it so I got the rest to go. It is a promising dish. 

My sister got the Dougie- a breakfast sandwich with a side of fries. I had a bite as well and it was toasted to perfection. I definitely remember it having a good crunch and the bacon was the best part of the sandwich :-))"}
{"text":"Bite is diffidently...far from a bite! The portions of food are huge, my kids could split a plate of there huge pancakes or get them kids portions! The range of food is amazing...I really loved the customer service, friendly,  personable, and extremely professional. I highly recommend and i will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot, which speaks volumes because I typically decline dining out for breakfast since I'm never really impressed. 

We have visited Bite during prime hours and while it's a bit slow and every visit is consistent in service and quality. I really hope they are here to stay!


My favorite menu items:

The Health Nut Omelette
Sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, basil, avocado & goat cheese. (Pictured with extra crispy hash browns)

Kale, spinach, cucumber, pineapple FRESH SQUEEZED JUICE. 


The kids have tried basically every pancake on the menu, never with a complaint."}
{"text":"I was delighted with my omelet (BYO ham, mushrooms, tomato & goat cheese with salsa on top).  The food tasted fresh and of good quality, well-prepared.  The coffee was good too.  The dining area is kind of basic but, there is a full wall of windows and lots of light. Service was good and the owner or manager was very earnest about the business.  Parking was ample and at door.  The weekends are busy I was told.  Next time I'm going to ask them to hold the pancake until I've finished the omelet to avoid it getting cold."}
{"text":"If you're in the South Summerlin area it's a great place for breakfast.  The food was ono and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Brunch. The churro French toast is out of this world. The service is always spectacular. You can tell everyone loves working here. It's a fantastic little spot you will never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not pictured is a most delicious cold pressed juice of apple, carrot, and ginger. My omelette was the BOMB.COM! Eggs, shredded chicken, green bell pepper, cilantro, onion, and salsa verde with a side of potatoes. I asked for extra salsa verde as it was LIFE! Fruit was fresh and delicious, too! Service was amazing! If I could give them more stars, I would. Coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, quality food, excellent fresh juice...and fast service. Fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came by today prior to our trip to Red Rock Park.  My wife ordered the Chiliquilles and I had the corned beef hash.  We were not disappointed.  Everything was fresh and definitely cooked to order.  Only thing to be aware is that they are cash only and somewhat hard to find.  They are just south of the McDonalds."}
{"text":"I am still dreaming of the BITE breakfast special of three over easy eggs, surrounded by three fluffy pancakes and topped with bites of bacon, sausage and syrup. Excuse me while I drool. SRSLY??!?!? This was such a great breakfast spot find! THANK YOU FELLOW YELPERS! On a recent visit to Vegas, we stayed off the strip in Summerlin As it is a small community and not a tourist destination, finding restaurants required a bit of Google mapping and pouring over yelp reviews. Thank goodness we checked this place out. Located in a strip mall that was pretty quite for a Saturday morning, we found BITE. It is a large room with exposed ceilings. They have a few arty BITE signs hanging in the dining room, a chalk board with daily specials and large windows so light comes beaming through. Outside of that, it can feel a little underwhelming. But it quickly recovers with fresh juice options, bubbly servers and well executed food. The wait time was fairly good. The place has a buzz about it and had tons of locals waiting along side visitors. And the food presented itself as high quality, not greasy spoon, which I really liked. Why does everything have to be $30+ if its 'organic' or cooked well? UGHH! Come to bite, you'll like it. Or you can bite me if you don't! (see what I did there... )"}
{"text":"Love the food and the employees :)  great small breakfast place that serves fresh pressed juices!!!  We haven't had a meal we didn't enjoy!  Support local small business and enjoy the small business feel!"}
{"text":"everybody there was so sweet and nice the food was amazing my sister had the turkey sausage that was so good my sweet potato pancakes were even better ! love this place"}
{"text":"After finding this place thru Instagram and Yelp we decided to have it a try. We love trying new places, and this one was a great find. From the moment you walk in the service is great. We were seated right away and in no time we had our server asking us for our drinks order. I have to say their fresh juices were awesome. The food was also just as delicious as it looks. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food you get, and overall was a great place for a Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"amazing breakfast, amazing red potatoes and skillets. The French Toast are definitely on point! Customer service has a very local feeling, very nice service. been coming once every week. Love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE BITE!!! Great staff and great food! I recommend to start your weekend off right with breakfast here. I'm eventually going to try to have lunch here!"}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed juice in a mason jar ( not organic tho)

Big portions and made to order! 

Im unsure if the syrup is maple or just maple flavored either way its diluted

Pancakes were dry and lacked flavor. Maybe try a better oil to cook it in?

Fried chicken was crisp - a little to salty.

I love the concept...maybe have a smaller menu and rid of all artificial stuff?!

If you dont mind these things- go!
Service is 100% great

Just remember- im a foodie and dint eat anywhere typical!"}
{"text":"It was a little busy, so the service was a little slow. We got the favorite scramble, which was gross. We sent it back which the happily replaced with the confetti pancakes which were really just pancakes with sprinkles. I got the steak chilaquiles which were ok. The kid got the wonder berry waffles, the berries tasted like plastic. Summary, food was a little mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"Good food. Good juice. I'm not a juicer, but the apple and ginger drink they made just might convert me. The fresh pressed juice along with good, quality food would bring me right back to this place. I appreciate what they're doing here. We need more places like this. 

Do yourself a favor and skip the chains and eat local."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. Obviously locally owned and run but not in a bad way. Lot of pride in this spot and justifiably so.

I love to find a spot to post up, read my book and take my time. Not too loud in here and the staff is ridiculously friendly. Coffee is good and they keep it coming. That's important. 

I've had a few of their signature dishes including their house made hash and most of their omelets. Everything has been good though I wasn't a huge fan of their chicken fried steak. It wasn't bad, I'm just a sicker for the thin pounder and breaded CFS you typically find. 

Potatoes and hash browns are both good, can't go wrong with that decision. Everyone shod check this place out."}
{"text":"SUNDAYS are PACKED!

Roomie wanted us to try this place so we came here for lunch on a Sunday hot afternoon & the moment we open the door it was like PACKED FULL HOUSE CRAZY! The decor was cute like simple diner style.

We Waited for about 15 minutes(party of 3) as our names were on the wait list... the moment a table got up they cleared that table up fast because by the time those people were walking out the door we were already being walked to the table.

The menu was HONESTLY a bit overwhelming w/ so many different selections double sided not very big font but we pulled it together & decided.

So it took about 7 minutes until someone came to take our drink orders but the waitress that came through was sweet & patient as we ordered too many items for ourselves (the bois mainly) but she got them. She brought out our mason jar juices right away & when they went low she brought us a round of waters. The food took about 20 minutes but it was busy which seemed non-stop until it died out when we got our food.

HAZELNUT PANCAKES $9.75 - 3 huge pancakes served w/ hazelnut bits, whipped cream, banana, & nutella drizzle. I asked for extra nutella but it seemed normal as there was only drizzle for the first layer. It was also sitting in the window for a while because I saw a big pile of whip cream & there was what looked like liquidized cream when it got to the table along w/ maybe half a banana in slices.

SOUTHERN BENEDICT  $10.95 - English muffin topped w/ sausage patty, poached egg, & bacon gravy. Not bad just simple.

NATALIE'S BREAKFAST BURGER $11.95 - this was like a protein on protein on protein stack of protein in between a bun. MEATY but but bland.

GATSPY BURGER $12.95 - Crispy onion strings, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, BBQ sauce, mayo & cheddar cheese...Topped with a sunny side up egg. The beef patty was juicy but it definately needed a little seasoning for the thickness

DREY'S CORN BEEF HASH $4.95 - lots of beef & KAPOWW in yo face flavor!

WILL'S WRAP $6.99 - Onion, peppers, bacon, sausage, cheddar Egg whites, turkey bacon, basil and cheese, potatoes & egg

BITE'S HASH $2.75 - rectangle piece of hashbrown with big chunks of potato

ORANGE JUICE $3.99 - fresh squeezed but it wasn't very cold probably because it was stored in a open display fridge thing

APPLE JUICE $4.99 - freshly squeezed ahahah wasn't my thing my palate needs to get used to it. xP

ALL-IN-ALL it was a cute place to try... there is a variety of choices for those that can't decide on one thing ... i just feel that they could consolidate their menu & focus on the flavor of more specific items. But it could also just not be my style of eats. Just your average eatery for foods that you don't want to cook at home yourself"}
{"text":"I Love This Place!!!
Tasty Food, Incredible Variety !!
Fast , Friendly , Efficient Service. 
The Bathrooms are very Family Friendly. 
WE will BE Back 
I Dig IT!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, modern decor, great waitresses, delicious breakfast options. Freshly squeezed juices are amazing and super healthy! Really enjoyed this spot!"}
{"text":"Great service,friendly staff ,clean restrooms, and good food. My son, sister and I really enjoyed breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but the way this place is run is questionable. We came in and the door was propped open (more about this later), we were seated quickly. I was wondering why it wasn't a bit busier on a Sunday morning, but oh well we are hungry right? The food isn't bad (I have ordered it on UberEats before), and the service is pretty good.  The food came out quickly and the waters stayed filled. Anyways, it's comes time to pay so I go to the front with card in hand only to hear \"oh did you see the sign on the door? It's cash only, the card reader is broken.\" Ok, well back to the door... since it was propped open, NO I did not see the sign, nor was I warned at any point in the meal that it was cash only. So now I'm here pissed off waiting for my husband to bring back cash for the meal since we don't carry any. After this happened I read reviews and it sounds like the owner is just too cheap to pay for credit card fees. Don't bother going here."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, I had more than enough and it was so delicious! This is definitely one of my top breakfast restaurants ill be eating at."}
{"text":"Found this place while driving around looking for some good breakfast that didn't have a 30 minute wait just to be seated. 

Nice home feel, kind of like a family business. All the employees were really helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. They serve fresh squeezed fruit juices which are awesome and everything on their menu sounded really good. They serve avocado! Big plus in my book for restaurants. Fairly priced, and the food was delicious.

Would love to go back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The service is great, food came out fast and tastey. I had the eggs florintine and my daughter had the monte Cristo benedict. The menu had a good variety of breakfast and lunch options also offering fresh juice and French press coffee. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place on a whim after hiking at Red Rock Canyon.  We were seated immediately and they took our order fairly quickly.  The food come out within 10 minutes.  Overall we loved the food and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a good breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fun and clean atmosphere AND delicious food! Better then any breakfast I could get in the strip. Definitely coming back on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the biggest problems I have with Las Vegas is there are not a lot of \"Mom & Pop\" type restaurants here.  Most of the restaurants are either chains, pubs or restaurants to cater to tourists.  However, I'm always on the hunt for great little places like this one.  Went there for breakfast yesterday and I was very pleased.  I was in the mood for pancakes, so I got the Mint Chocolate Chip Pancakes with bacon and fried eggs.  The pancakes were outstanding, however it is a HUGE portion.  I could only eat half.  And they are very rich with the chocolate fudge, whipped cream, chocolate chips, and the maple syrup.  The bacon was perfect, not too crisp and not too limp and it was rather thick cut, which I like.  The eggs were also cooked perfect.  I'm not an egg eater, but when I do eat them, I want them COOKED, no runny yolks!  And they were perfect.  My server was very good and very kind.  The place was clean as well.  The one issue I had was they may need a pest control person to come spray.  Nothing major, but a fly kept wanting to share my breakfast.  He never landed on any of the food, but I guess he wanted some company.  Other than that, I was very pleased and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here after the long wait at rise and shine.  I got the basic egg and bacon breakfast.  The service was quick and efficient.  The food was good.  It's tough for a breakfast place to score high with me as there is only so much you can do with bacon and eggs hash browns and toast for $9.  This is a good place and we will dine here again."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. The service and food are always excellent. I usually get The Bites Benedict. Fantastic! My grandson always gets the funfetti pancakes. This is our favorite, go-to place for breakfast. The cold-press juices are great, as well. Highly recommend The Bite."}
{"text":"Place was near my hotel and had good reviews, so I gave it a shot on a Monday morning.

Place was pretty dead with one girl hosting, waiting, serving, and ringing people up.  She was nice, but I had to wait a while when I needed something.

Tried their self proclaimed specialty steak wrap or whatever it was called (eggs wrapped with a thin steak), and it was really not very good.  Homestyle potatoes that came with it were ok, but definitely wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Solid, low-key breakfast joint in Summerlin.  Service is a bit slow but food tasted as good and fresh as it could for a typical egg/omelette and toast combo.  Prices are Summerlin prices and they up charge for everything, but it's still a nice venue to start your day off right with a solid meal.  I had the egg white skillet with rye toast and a side of fruit.  I was extremely full (rare when ordering an egg white omelette) and was pleased with the freshness of the omelette ingredients and the fruit salad.  Give it a try; support a local joint."}
{"text":"Came here for a Valentine's Day breakfast. Saw this place has great reviews....we had the Eggs Benedict. TERRIBLE.....I will say though the customer service is really good. Try at own risk"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and our waiter was very polite, accommodating and thorough. The orange juice is very fresh - squeezed by their machine right before it was served. The banana french toast was served with warm syrup - the good and bad was that the portion was huge. My husband can normally devour anything placed in front him - not the case in this situation. The red potatoes with my food were delicious - made to the right amount of crispy without being soggy. 

The only thing I would have liked to see on their menu was a smaller portion of their waffles and pancakes (single portion)...this would have allowed us to share something aside from getting a regular main dish. But, can't dock them stars for that - it's just a personal preference."}
{"text":"I love this place! We've been here a dozen times and never been disappointed. The breakfast is fantastic. We've had the classic egg breakfasts and pancakes and all delicious (pancakes served with warm maple syrup). The lunch is equally delicious. I've had the homemade chicken fingers, the buffalo wrap ... hubby has had the burger and steak sandwich, all delicious. Try their homemade lemonade, you can't go wrong! My favorite thing about this place is the customer service. I love the atmosphere and the people! Check this place out. I look forward to my weekends as we try and enjoy one meal here as a treat!"}
{"text":"I ate the funfetti pancakes and the spicy burger! It was amazing!! The spicy burger was truly awesome! 
Girlfriend had the mint chocolate chip pancakes and the corned beef hash! Both were great!! Definitely coming back to try some other things on their menu!!"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite breakfast place to go to! I was so impressed to find a place that serves real and flavorful chorizo. Every time we have been we haven't been disappointed because everything we have tried has been good (corned beef hash, some like it hot skillet, strawberry pancakes). You definitely get a lot of options to choose from, but not too many where you feel overwhelmed. Also kudos to Bite for making gluten free pancakes an option for people like my myself and my kid! The cold brew coffee is delicious as well as their hot coffee. As much as we love the food I have to say the service is the best part compared to other breakfast places we have frequented. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and really does a great job of ensuring to get your order done right."}
{"text":"Food was great! The turkey spinach wrap hit the spot along with the strawberry cheesecake French toast. This place is small and laid back, no complaints with the service"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around noon and the place was practically empty. The server was attentive and friendly. We got the Monte Cristo French toast and Ultimate pancakes, both of which were delicious.

Parking was very easy in the huge plaza."}
{"text":"Tried Bites with my family. The food was good and the service quick and friendly. Pricing is decent for the amount of food you receive. Good place to bring your children as they have portions sizes for the young ones."}
{"text":"Food took exactly an hour. Wanted a quick breakfast, but it took almost an hour & a half. Mostly waiting time, we ate in about 15 min....we were starving.

Food was ok, pancakes tasted like powder, according to my 9 year old. Strawberry, cream cheese French toast, had a very thin layer of cream cheese, more like butter as opposed to \"filled\". Good amount of strawberries, though. My husband & bro in laws food was \"pretty good.\"  Fresh-squeezed OJ was yummy.

Just seemed like they were understaffed, but it looks like a new place. I'm sure once they get all the kinks out, it'll be great.  The staff was super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the 2nd time with my love. The food is so good, lots of homemade items on the menu (like corned beef hash - which I'm very picky about, I don't like when restaurants serve the canned store bought type). They have fresh and cold pressed juices. Service is great and prices are decent. I had the funfetti pancakes; good, but I expected funfetti batter, not just regular pancakes with sprinkles. My man had the stuffed breakfast steak with corned beef hash and enjoyed it. Next time I'm trying their chilaquiles :)"}
{"text":"I think I've found a new favorite! Met my friend for brunch & we stayed for hours. Comfortable surroundings & the menu had such great variety. Everything sounded delish! Generous portions but not overwhelming. Service was attentive without swarming. Even their coffee was great! Locally owned & let me say that the owner was super nice & hands on with the service. I live in Henderson but it is well worth the 20 min drive!"}
{"text":"We were on this side of town for an appointment and decided to give this place a shot. We were seated pretty quickly. Drinks are served in mason jars, very cute and country. Their menu has a lot of items on it. Typical pancakes, waffles, French toast, and sandwiches for lunch. Hubby ordered Drey's Corned Beef Hash and I ordered Bite's Stuffed Steak. 

Decor is sparse. It's a fairly plain place. The music was nice and it was enough to drown out a table full of obnoxious teenagers that were being ridiculously loud about the people they're sleeping with. Completely inappropriate conversation for a place that had families dining. 

Very poor ventilation, my hair and clothes smelled like cooking grease all day.

Ok first complaint. Hubby originally wanted to order Bite's Loco Moco but they didn't have ground beef left (boo!). They also didn't have any hashbrowns left... I'm sorry but if you know that those are popular item menus then you should order more of it to ensure you don't run out. 

Hubby was somewhat disappointed in the corned beef hash. It was very dry and the serving size was very small for the price. Flavor was good but just not worth the money. Wouldn't order this again. 

The stuffed steak was good. Steak was cooked perfectly but not enough seasoning. I don't think it's worth ordering again either. 

Customer service was great, our server even made me an iced coffee that wasn't on the menu. Hubby wants to come back to try the loco moco. We might have to call prior just to make sure they actually have it but until then, this review"}
{"text":"I'm a first generation Filipino American and grew up having rice with my breakfast so not just any place will do. 

My husband and I wanted to stay near the area we needed to do some shopping at so I was pleased to find Bite on yelp and the high ratings. 

As expected, Sunday morning was busy but there were a few available tables that we didn't have to wait. Thank goodness because 5 minutes later, we would have been standing in line. 

My husband initially ordered the short rib hash. Unfortunately, they were not serving it that day. the waiter did mention that they might be brining it back. Well, I recommend taking it off the menu until then. 

My husband ordered the country fried steak instead while I ordered the huevos rancheros as it came with rice. 

The portions are perfect, not too much and not too little. My husband commented on the how good the breading was on his country fried steak. As for my breakfast, not boring at all. The eggs sat on two pieces of crunchy tortillas which I liked the little snap to it. On the side was a little salad that I wondered why, but it really went well with my meal. The rice was cooked perfect but the refried beans was a little runny. I'm not an expert on refried beans but I do know I like mines a little thicker. 

My husband asked about the \"cold press\" to which it was explained that the juices are freshly pressed every morning. My husband ordered the apple lemon ginger. Because he ordered it after we finished our meal, we needed to take it to go. walking around with a glass mason jar without a place for a straw is not ideal. But beware, the drink is $6.95 and they charge $1.00 for the jar. So although my husband had his drink put into a plastic cup, we took home the jar. 

The service was fantastic. We noticed that no women were working that morning. In any case, it was nice to see several young men hustling and making it a great way to start the day which is something I rarely see nowadays. In fact, the lady sitting next to us returned her breakfast as they didn't make her meal as she had requested. A minute later, what seemed to be the manager came over to check to see if she was okay, which she was. And a few minutes later, a whole new breakfast based on her request appeared. 

I also have to comment on the music. I grew up in HI, so it was very nice for me to hear reggae, feel good island music playing. Now I wish they had fried rice omelette or HI style fried rice with eggs and Portuguese sausage or even loco micro on the menu. 

By observing the many establishments I have been to, running a successful restaurant has got to be one of the most difficult things to do. Mahalo guys for truly getting my day started off right."}
{"text":"The hollandaise could be thicker but this place is cool. Wraps are awesome. The waitress who waited on us was drop dead gorgeous and the nicest girl ever. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time and it was Ahhh-mazing!!! The food was fresh perfect flavor. Excellent service, friendly great for families. Enough variety that your not bored with your standard eggs, omelette s, waffle and pancakes. Great selection on the menu. The fresh juices were delicious nice and cold..:: blended very well. We had the special cornbread and waffle the chicken was perfect well seasoned and cooked. The hot maple syrup was an great touch. All the food on the menu can be made kids size so pancakes were the perfect size for my kids strawberry and Nutella flavors which they actually finished!!! So attentive the Manager was and friendly ..... We have definitely found a new breakfast and lunch spot for our family!! Tired of the boring ol' breakfast this the new hot breakfast restaurant"}
{"text":"Was the first customer of the day. The staff were professional and welcoming. Had the delicious Kale, Spinach, Cucumber and Pineapple fresh juice and the chicken chilaquiles. Both were superb. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. I ordered the eggs and bacon, one lemon poppyseed pancake and one peanut butter. Neither of the pancakes were good and the bacon was too crispy. The juice was okay though."}
{"text":"Fresh juice was a great start to breakfast. Food was good. Service was great. Staff is very friendly. Will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST pancakes I have ever had, the lemon poppy seed pancakes!!! We of course had other food that was so delicious and was told by my husband that the omelette he had (you can build your own) was so good. What made it good and different, it was made with green olives. 5 star on food for sure. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"What a find. Everything was fresh and delicious, especially the fresh squeezed OJ. WOW! Haven't had OJ that good in a very long time. Coffee was excellent and not bitter. Had the hash browns but will probably choose their other potato option next time.  Our server Carlos was excellent and on top of everything. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was quite tasty, decent prices.  Service was not particularly slow but, except for the lone female, the staff seemed somewhat disorganized."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. The extensive menu offered something for everyone and then some! I also liked the island music they played. The restaurant was clean and the service was great. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"If you plan on venturing over to Bite, it can be a bit confusing finding their West Flamingo location within the labyrinth of strip malls, as their logo does not stand out in the least and cannot be seen from the main access road. Just find Tropical Smoothie and it's a few properties over.

The setting is a bit odd, as it almost feels like the restaurant is unfinished; the walls are blank, the ceilings are high with an uneven amount of natural light--it just felt a bit off, like something was missing. 

Bite offers breakfast and lunch, with the standard offerings, but also some unique dishes like the Crunchy Cinnamon Raisin French Toast; cinnamon raisin bread crusted with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and cooked in the traditional french toast fashion. For personal reasons, I ordered mine without the cereal crust, along with a side of bacon.

The French toast was good, but similar to the environment, it felt like something was missing. The cinnamon raisin bread was lacking a sort of sweetness, as well as that cinnamon flavor you'd expect from that sort of bread. I'm not sure if this by design, or because the cereal is meant to add the sweetness, but it was still tasty regardless. The bacon was also really good quality as well. 

Overall, as someone who loves to frequent breakfast places, Bite was good, but wasn't particularly memorable. I'll probably stop by every once in a while to sample their other dishes, but if you're just looking for a decent breakfast at a good price, you can't go wrong with Bite."}
{"text":"Hubs keeps on bugging me to write a review about them so here we go: 

We've been here twice and were impressed both times by the food and service. I can't remember what I had the first time, but it was the special of the day and I think it had brisket,  or might have been the short rib hash. Either way...amazing flavor!  Second time around, had The Favorite skillet which was so filling but very good. I loved that it had avocado and I think gorgonzola or goat cheese. Yum. 

Hubby has a sweet tooth so he tried one of the waffle dishes and then the banana nut bread french toast. Waffles and french toast are his go-to's for breakfast spots and determines whether it's a good one or not. This place passed his test! 

Service is quick and friendly. I hope more people come and try them out so they can stick around for awhile. I'm sure we'll be back often as we're right across the street."}
{"text":"Orange juice was a bit pricy ($4) I believe. We order the monte cristo and a skillet. The monte cristo was excellent while the skillet was bland. We also ordered avocado which never came. The music was great, until it turned off in the middle of the meal. Spent around $50 after tip (we had three glasses of oj between two people). Wasn't throughly impressed, but worth checking out."}
{"text":"The service was completely substandard. We had to ask repeatedly for water, which they didn't bring for 20 mins. They forgot for items, never brought syrup with the French toast and had to ask twice for jam with the toast. That is when they brought the toast, which sat on the window to be served until we were about to leave. The food is pretty good, but it's hard to enjoy with really poor services. They also forgot our cold brew and finally brought it in a togo cup as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Sadly this is one of the worst meals I have ever had. Bought lunch for my office and everyones order was wrong. Left items off, put items on that were asked to be deleted. Chicken hard as a rock and overall terrible. Wont be going back... too bad!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing this city isn't lacking (other than steakhouses, nightclubs, and hookers) it's breakfast spots. The owners of this place relocated their business from Sun City in Summerlin to the space formerly occupied by the short-lived Pasta Fresh. There's not much decor to speak of other than wall art made from planks of wood. Luckily, the food is more noteworthy than their interior design. Their large, all-American menu is full of sandwiches, wraps, and breakfast items. The most creative items are their pancakes, waffles, and French toasts. Too much mint extract takes away from an otherwise fluffy stack of mint chocolate chip pancakes. Beer cakes proved more impressive with subtle hoppiness within airy pancakes. The stack of three contained chunks of bacon within the batter and sprinkled on top. Probably the equivalent of three strips of bacon.

Come hungry if you want to finish any of those items or others such as a large, well executed BLT ($8.95) or the Gatspy burger ($12.95) -- hand-ground meat topped with crispy strips of bacon, onion strings, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and a sunny side up egg. It might be a greasy mess, but it will hit the spot if that's what you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Great service, good food! Nice and warm and cozy!!! Definitely coming back here! Great service! FRESH orange juice and TVS to watch the game! Coming here often forsure"}
{"text":"First time here and it's FABULOUS!  Highly recommend.   Had failed drug test pancakes -- lemon poppyseed -- and let me say the warm syrup not needed!  These cakes perfect off the griddle!   Also shared a over the border omlette.   Perfect size and SOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!      We had potatoes instead of hashbrowns.  We will be back.  OFTEN!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite breakfast stops but something has changed in recents months which turned this once 5 star must establishment into a forgettable 2 Star diner.

No credit cards accepted is a major inconvenience when wanting to take a large family to eat. I have no clue why they went with this strategy but if this was done to save money, I can assure them it is costing them more money than it is saving.

Service is good but the last time we went we were the only people in the entire restaurant so I'd only expect good service in such a scenario. A lot of the old familiar faces we used to see and speak with appear to no longer be there.

This place used to have great ambiance but when the restaurant is empty, it now feels depressing.

The food is good overall. 

There are so many options for breakfast in Summerlin, including directly across the street, that's it difficult to keep going back here. 

As a fan of this place, I am pulling for them to turn things around. What they did a year ago worked beautifully. I hope they can restore some of that old magic.i"}
{"text":"Found this jewel last year and was impressed on my first visit. Now, it's my number one, two, and three choices when its breakfast time. Not exaggerating!

So far the different meals that I've tried were excellent, but the country fried steak is definitely the best."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. They make you feel welcomed and at home as you walk through the door. Great options for food. This is a going to be in the rotation for sure!"}
{"text":"Bite catered breakfast for my daughter's birthday party, with less than a full day's notice. The food was incredibly tasty and looked as good as it tasted, especially the French toast. Everything was perfect. Highly recommend. Honestly not a single complaint."}
{"text":"Saturday 11:45 open tables.  Loud music- revolting.  

Staff of what appears to be LA thuggish presence with service Lethargic.   10 minutes waiter never came to table.

Asked another staff to order he had to get him and he reluctantly strolled but never made it as he was stopped by kitchen with line of tickets and apparent confusion.   Decor blah- one square room tables plopped and no personality.  

Walked out and no one even paused, cared or noticed.  Rest my cast."}
{"text":"THe food here was delicious! The huevos rancheros had such great flavor. The Chilaquiles were a perfect portion and you could taste the fresh vegetables. 
Chicken fried steak was large and in charge. Have a good appetite when you order it. So delicious you will overfill yourself. 
Menu had great options!!!
The people here are all gorgeous inside and out. Very friendly and want you to enjoy your meal!! 
Music and ambience were enjoyable! 
CANT WAIT TO COME BACK"}
{"text":"Younger crowd would probably appreciate this more than I did.  The portions are killer and the combinations are incredible - but being Hawaiian based, the SPAM and butter run freely!  It was delicious and I would do it again, but not until I lose the ten pounds from my first visit!  I just noticed that someone said the food is healthy... I have to disagree unless we were looking at two different menus?  What did I miss???"}
{"text":"Great food and staff! This is our second time at the restuarant (the first time we ordered take out) and decided to write a review as the food and service were just as great the second time.  My husband had Huevos Rancheros and I had The Protein omelet, both were well flavored, their homemade green sauce on the Huevos was amazing! My husband wanted his eggs a bit more runny and the staff attended to it promptly. We also tried a couple of the juices, all freshly made/squeezed, we mixed pineapple/guava (great sweet for my husband) and had the ginger/apple/lemon (I love ginger based drinks and this was fresh, had the gingery bite with apple to sweeten, but not too sweet). The food is well flavored with many items made fresh in house (e.g. home made raisin bread, home made sauces), the menu has a great selection.  Exceptional staff ( professional yet personable, down to earth,  attentive and just very pleasant) they make the experience that much more enjoyable. For great food and staff, pleasant atmosphere, reasonable prices, this is a place  we really recommend for a good breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Food here is legit! Worth the short drive away from the strip. Better than any breakfast place in the touristy areas. Awesome bacon, sausage links, potatoes (both ways are great), strawberry French toast, homemade salsa, and good local coffee. Also, fresh squeezed green juice to make you less guilty about all that comfort food. Everything is quality, prepared perfectly, and delicious. Service was also perfect, fast, friendly. You can't go wrong here, one of the best breakfast places I've been to."}
{"text":"We visited Bites yesterday for breakfast with a coupon and happy we did! Quiet and clean place..with friendly and eager staff, but most important a delicious menu! Great fresh cold press juices! We will definitely return:)"}
{"text":"Really good food!  Casual, comfortable & friendly setting---
Fresh ingredients, tasty recipes!  Breakfast was excellent.  My friend had the breakfast special: perfect waffle made into a Monte Cristo presentation with great hashbrowns. 
I had simple breakfast burrito, very Good & served with great green salsa. 
This place is a keeper.   Simple room, good food."}
{"text":"Food was good but dam there service sucked. Walked in girl took our drinks, brought the wrong drinks couldn't even get the water with limon right and then forgot our straws. Placed our food order, they forgot our maple syrup, then had to remind him about the strawberries on my pancakes. As we were done we placed our credit card at the end of the table and 2 of them passed by us twice and none of them picked up the check."}
{"text":"We stumbled into Bite a couple months ago and have consistently returned every single Sunday that we are in town!!!  The food is absolutely, hands-down, FANTASTIC!  This is my favorite brunch spot in Vegas.  I have tried several items on the menu and you really can't go wrong.  Right now I'm hooked on the turkey and bacon wrap... it may sound simple but there is something about it that makes it scrumptious.  In addition, the pancakes are OMG-I've-Died-and-Gone-To-Heaven GREAT!!!!  We will sometimes order a kid sized version and split between four of us as a little appetizer.  They are the best in the entire city!!!  The red velvet are my fave but they are all great!  And btw, Andre (the owner) and Bianca (one of the servers) are AWESOME!!!! The service and attention to detail they offer is missing in today's restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Super cute. Super nice staff. Super food!  What else is there to say? The restaurant is in a strip mal but don't let that fool you. They make the food fresh. Interesting choices...steak roll is what I got. Chicken and waffles are pretty popular too. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Good food, however they don't have enough staff or consistency! 
I believe we met everyone who works for the restaurant, kept coming out asking us if we are okay but no food or coffee was brought out! 
After 45-50 min we got our food.... not all at the same time. Now when it's time to pay the bill- the server says no credit cards ... CASH only! 
Not to worry we have an ATM machine that will charge you to get cash out! 
I don't mind paying in cash- although I believe they should tell you that the beginning or put a sign on the door! Now what if I didn't have a debit card on me.... 
it's not ethical to have your customers pay your credit card fees!!!! 
Have a business PayPal or Venmo account!
Unfortunately will not be going back or recommending to anyone! Sorry ....."}
{"text":"Yum just yum. It's been nearly a year since the last time I was in Vegas, and I still want to go back again. A little out of the way from the usual tourist traps,  but, so worth it. Just go! :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim and was not disappointed.  The staff was very friendly, attentive and accommodating.  I had the fresh green juice, french press coffee and chicken chilaquiles with poached eggs and all if it was excellent.  My friend had the sweet potato pancakes served with warm maple syrup and a side of fruit.  She was very happy with her choices.  The menu has a lot of variety, so I'm guessing most everyone can find something to enjoy.  If atmosphere is really important to you, you may find the decor a little puzzling.  BUT the food more than makes up for it.  Based on the the influx of people I saw as I was leaving at 10 am (on a Sunday) you may want to arrive early (at least on Weekends)."}
{"text":"The food is good, nothing to write home about but everyone enjoyed their meal. the service is lacking but they are very friendly. Nice open seating. Never has it been busy when I've gone."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

I thought I had written a review of this place , actually I'm positive I did,  and somehow it was removed ....whatever

Bite is an okay place to grab a casual breakfast or lunch. Their smoothies are great but my corned beef hash was really salty and packed flavor.

Service is really great and parking around this strip mall is good as well.

I think with so many choices for breakfast I'd look elsewhere"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating there and I had a really great experience! The customer service was on point from every staff member. Everyone was very friendly. The environment was great. The food was perfect! When I come back to Las Vegas I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Still..... the heavy weight champion of the breakfast category! Best breakfast ever! Gotta grab a fresh pressed juice while your at it! :)"}
{"text":"This place suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucksssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss. Worst place ever the reviews are fake and the food is terrible. I had raw Chilaquiles...YES RAW???. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"The wife and I were in Las Vegas for a basketball tournament.  I travel often but don't always write reviews unless the food and service is exceptional.  That is true here at Bite.  I had an order of their steak chiliquilles (did I spell that right?), and my wife had the corned beef hash.  Both dishes were excellent and the quantity of food was very generous (we could have shared one order and would have left full).  While I enjoyed my food very much, in comparison if you like corned beef hash, I would highly recommend getting that.  This wasn't a canned corned beef hash, the corned beef was very tasty and the amount of corned beef in the dish was impressive.  The restaurant was clean, our service was excellent and we will definitely visit again next year when we return for another tournament.  Just be aware, they do not take credit cards...it is cash only."}
{"text":"Delightful delicious breakfast with terrific service. Sweet potato waffles, corned beef hash unlike any other. Loved the food and the dining experience today at Bite!"}
{"text":"Food was really good service was aweful. Seating people who came in after  to no sugery for the tea. People walking out these young boys need guidance"}
{"text":"Bite is awesome- the menu has a great variety and you can tell there is love in every item of the menu. Bacon and sausage gravy on the biscuits? Yum! The vibe is casual and cool. The service is friendly and genuine. Hands down the best Reuben sandwich in Vegas. Doesn't get any better than this. They are even opening for dinner soon- definitely go check it out."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say this place has the most friendliest staff , very family oriented it's a pleasure to watch them work altogether as a TEAM. An much love to them for always playing Bob Marley making it a relaxing Sunday Fun Day. Second this has to be Hands down the BEST breakfast joint. I've tried many things here and NEVER disappointed, and don't even get me stared on their freshly squeezed juice a must have every time, OJ being my fav. I would recommend them to anyone and I do every chance I get. Much love to all of you at BITE"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast/lunch spot. I've been there a few times and it's never overcrowded. I love that. 
I've never tried lunch, but I enjoy their breakfast. Especially homemade corned beef hash. That's my favorite that makes me come back over and over again :)"}
{"text":"What a terrific place for breakfast! Casual. Great fresh food. Menu features a mix of traditional and innovative dishes. Chilaquiles were really good. Homemade chips.  Fresh juices. Excellent service. A great neighborhood find."}
{"text":"We take our granddaughter 14 months)  out to eat once or twice a week and we love the little breakfast/lunch places. Besides the food being great the service was excellent. Anything we needed for the baby was brought right away and what really impressed me is a very clean bathroom with extremely clean place to change diapers. What I look for in a place we take her is comfort to not feel like she's bugging anyone. One TV even had the Disney channel on that she watched off and on. Love this family friendly place and we will be back again.."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be a great place for breakfast, but I was really disappointed. I know that restaurants have such steep competition in Vegas, but, there always a few local spots that can hang. Its a really cute space, but after looking over the menu, I'm confused with their overall style of food. Reggae music is playing, huevos rancheros and other \"south of the border\" options are on the menu, so I cannot pinpoint their style. The website states \"modern American food with flare\", which also boasts over 20 kinds of pancakes (didn't see those) or pancake lollipops(didn't see these either). I may have seen the owner, Andrey, but he definitely wasn't making rounds with customers or working the line. He was outside giving dap to a new tenant next door. 

 On this first visit,  we ordered the Monte Cristo French toast Benedict. The menu describes it as the Monte Cristo atop some of the best French toast finished with over easy eggs and hollandaise sauce. Typically Monte Cristo sandwiches are deep-fried with ham and Swiss cheese, served with traditional raspberry jelly and powdered sugar. MINE was layered with cold turkey and ham lunch meat, melted Swiss and less than spectacular French toast. In fact, the French toast had zero taste, so there really wasn't a great blend of sweet and salty. Looked like a thick cut of French bread in the picture, but pretty sure it was just a slice of Bimbo bread. The hollandaise was a huge disappointment. Runny and had a more than mild curry flavor. So again, I'm confused as to what the \"chef\" is trying to accomplish with these crossing over of flavors. My husband ordered a skillet, which is really hard to screw up, but lacked flavor. The freshly squeezed orange juice was great, but that's probably the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  I'm always hesitant to try new places around town, but willing to give a local establishment a first time try. I left feeling like this restaurant was trying hard to compete with Stacks and Yolks/Babystacks, but fell extremely short. There were some great items on the menu that might have some potential, but if you can't master a simple hollandaise, you might want to rethink your prized benedicts."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to Bite and we were very excited, based on the high Yelp reviews and pictures. 

Our initial take was this place is great! The customer service was great at the beginning and the juices were excellent. I had the fresh squeezed orange juice and my Girlfriend had the apple lemon ginger. 

We wanted to try a few things, so I had the monte cristo sandwich and she had one hazelnut pancake and half off an order of banana nut French toast. The minute cristo was ok...but not great. The meat was really good, but the French toast had no flavor. And it's served with a side of butter. Why?? I asked for a side of raspberry jam (which is what a monte cristo is SUPPOSED to come with). They guy said ok, but the girl who brought it out said they don't have that, and they only have strawberry purée. Which wasn't bad...but not the same thing. I was very disappointed because Las Vegas doesn't have a great Monte Cristo sandwich. I guess I still haven't found one. 

The hazelnut pancakes were good, but everyone does a Nutella pancake now a days. The banana nut French toast was by far the best thing! However, it wasn't really French toast...just banana bread with some banana and butter. 

The price was a bit too much. Total bill $35. $5 for one pancake, $8 for her juice and $4 for my OJ. It seemed a little much for those things. 

The final reason I gave a 4 star is that the owner said hello to everyone around us, except us. He spent a good 15 minutes talking to a guy who looked like a UFC fighter and then chatted up the old guy next to us for 5 min. Straight up ignores us, not even a hello or how's the food? 

Very disappointing experience overall. Dang it! I was really hoping for more."}
{"text":"Literally the best breakfast I've had in Vegas! The food was seasoned perfectly and the portions were beyond fair. Nice servers and music made this place feel like \"home\". Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"This place is awsome.  Love the vibe.  The juices are amazing and fresh squeezed, can't go wrong there! Love the crimini omelet and the stuffed breakfast steak! Make sure you check out the specials of the day though,  they're always interesting and fresh. Oreo pancakes, fried chicken benedict, crab cake benedict? The specials change weekly so make sure you check out what's new for the week.

The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's 25 minutes away from me.  Maybe that's a good thing in my case but it's well worth the drive.  If you come on the weekends make sure to come early, it fills up fast.  

This place is easily my favorite breakfast spot in town!

Keep up the good work and maybe think about opening one more central!"}
{"text":"My GF and I visited Bite on our last day in vegas. She was so thrilled to visit so I decided to take her here before he headed back to Cali. We both love brunch food and we had very high expectations for Bite, since it was rated so high. 

parking wasnt to bad but it was a friday morning, the restaurant wasnt  busy at all. This is where it all went down hill. Upon entering the restaurant there were no workers around to greet us. We walked up to their register and began scouring their menus to see if there is anything we wanted but being seated. 5 mins later a woman finally greets us and asks us to take 2 menus and find a place to sit. 

We ended up ordering the Will's Morning Wrap and Corn Beef Hash.

The wrap was a good size and was decent. It came with sausage, hash browns,and onions wrapped in a spinach tortilla, a flour option is also available. The salsa that accompanied the wrap was plain and not spicy whatsoever. 

The Corn Beef Hash came with toast, hash Browns and over easy eggs. It nothing to write home about and honestly wished I never ordered it. The corn beef lacked any flavor. 

Please save the trip if you are in vegas and just eat elsewhere or wait until you are back in Cali, as driving out here is not worth it."}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find - especially since the sign on the front isn't easy to read but we obviously found it. As we walk in the restaurant, we immediately ask for a cup of coffee and surprisingly, it was really strong and really good for not being a \"specialty coffee drink\". 

There was one employee/waiter who gave us mediocre service, but hey - the \"lazy\" vibe in the restaurant gives that off anyway. I ordered the Health Nut omelet with hash browns and the Nutty Monkey pancake. The pancake had way too much whip cream, but everything was pretty good. I was pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp!!!! I highly recommend it. My mom and I had breakfast there... The house hash was awesome the ultimate pancakes with real warm maple syrup was a treat... My mom had eggs Benedict also yummy!!! Fresh squeezed cold press juices are amazing!!! Made fresh daily .. Place is clean friendly and a bit out if the way but totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Our family of 5 absolutely loved it! The fresh orange juice was delicious. The mint chip and funfetti pancakes were great for the kids and the Nemo (salmon, capers, cream cheese) skillet was to die for. Wonderful staff and very clean!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised how tasty the food was. Their breads are super addictive (had the sourdough and cinnamon raisin) and the pressed juices were very satisfying. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has so many good reviews. I found it to be average at best.

The staff is very unorganized, had over a 15min wait when half the tables were empty. They also messed up on 2 of my items.

I had the french toast sampler combo.

The french toast churro was good but very sweet, the 2nd style was strawberry with a cream cheese. Wasnt very flavorful and the strawberries were not very good tasting. Not sure if its season or not but if its not they should take it off menu. The 3rd style was with bacon, bananna and peanut butter. On this on they forgot all the toppings so i had to send it back. When it returned the flavor was decent but whatever the peanut butter they use is very dry.

I also had a side of potatoes which they forgot to bring but when i brought it to their attention it was brought very promptly.  Sadly i wish i didnt ask for them as they where under cooked and very bland. They where supposed to have a seasoning but there was nothing on them. I think they may have forgot to add it? I dunno.

The reason i have them at 2 stars and not 1 is the bacon was very good and chewy.  I prefer chewy bacon over crispy.

There are a lot of other breakfast/brunch spots in town that are far superior imo."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite breakfast joints! The customer service is always outstanding. I love the music, the vibe, and friendly staff. To top it off, the food is delicious. I always get the Sandy wrap. Light and refreshing. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Service and breakfast was excellent. Corned beef was tasty and most importantly not salty tasting. We will return."}
{"text":"The breakfast jalapeño omelet was very good service was also very good would I recommend this place to others yes got to try it yourself"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu sounds delicious and it was so hard to pick my meal. They have fresh OJ and it was SO GOOD and little $$ but kinda worth it. They have a homemade gravy that is perfect. You'll definitely be happy you went. (:"}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast with my boyfriend. Service was super friendly and quick. Server answered all of our questions and made suggestions. My boyfriend opted to build his own omelette and he devoured it. I ordered a wrap with French fries. The server came over and said they were out of fries. He was really apologetic and offered to do onion rings or sweet potato fries. I got the onion rings and I'm so glad I did. They are the best onion rings I've ever had. Delicately seasoned and battered. 

We tried this place based on Yelp reviews and we had such a great experience that we will be regulars from now on. Awesome food and service."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to Bite, except for the two staff members who told us they would comp our drinks if we gave them a good Yelp review while we were there.  No Bueno.  That was offputting, but the food was excellent, and the service was otherwise okay.  Not great, but not terrible.

I built a ham, spinach, tomato, and cheddar omelet for $9.25 with cottage cheese ($1.00 sub charge) and breakfast potatoes.  The omelet was fluffy and delicious.  The cottage cheese was good, and I did not try the potatoes (I thought the cottage cheese was a $1 substitution for the toast and potatoes, but it must have just been for the toast). 

The BF got the Monte Cristo- Turkey, ham, fried egg, & Swiss cheese $10.49.  He said it was delicious and not overly greasy like Monte Cristo's can sometimes be.  We also liked that they brought warm syrup to the table.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! I can't even explain the joy in which this gave us this morning. I mean it is 2pm but it's my morning. Most amazing food and friendly staff. Great job. Found a new little gem in Las Vegas. This is why hospitality industry is so amazing in Vegas."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a nice area.  The music is common and dim. The restaurant looks like a cafeteria with cheap furniture and a bad paint job. The walls are painted a brown color, painted over wall fixtures and looks really tacky. There were only four people in the place when I walked in. it was empty. There was a table not bussed that looked very messy to start with. The restaurant didn't have a memorable smell. 

The celling beams are placed  too high and the table lamps are too short, hanging abnormally far from the table. The outside light is creating a painful contrast between the darkness inside. 

The water tasted like bleach. I couldn't drink it so I ordered some tea. Very cheap brand. I ordered the corn beef hash was not special. My sunny side ups had the egg white slimy and the meal itself tasted like noodle soup.

The server was nice and well groomed. I was not very chatty so he didn't harass me. He delivered my drinks and food promptly."}
{"text":"The food was really good and so was the service. I had waffles with stuffing and I didn't like it because it was too mushy. They took it back and gave me another waffle and it was awesome. The juice/lemonade is amazing and a must try!"}
{"text":"Well first off its a little cute spot that catches your eye because of its cute sign that spells bite with bacon and other foods! Came with my sister and 2 nieces. We all had a burger besides my sister. I had a bacon burger and boy was it delicious!! It was juicy, fat, flavorful and made exceptionally well! The fries were a mix of crinkle fries and something else and those were gone in about 5 seconds! Jk they were good! They have fresh juices and a great selection of breakfast and lunch. Service was great,out waiter was very friendly and food came out pretty fast. It is a smaller joint but good size. Will be back because I want to try some of their breakfast stuff I saw!!"}
{"text":"This breakfast spot is amazing. It reminds me of something that would be in LA. The juices are great. Service is amazing. I can't wait for the new dinner menu and night hours."}
{"text":"Came here because it got really good reviews. Wish I hadn't! Friendly staff, but the food is not good...and expensive for no flavor."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and the food is always good.  Made to order and fast service with a friendly staff.  If you come around 10am there will be a wait...out the door actually.  If you can make it around 1pm instead you'll avoid the rush.   

My only compliant about this place is the layout.  The chairs and tables can be upgraded, but I think that will come in time.  I don't believe they've been open long, but even from our first visit they've revamped their menu.  It's a lot cleaner and more concise now.  Overall we'll keep going back.   I try something different each time.  I love places that get my tastes buds going like that."}
{"text":"The Banana Bread French Toast is amazing. Sunday was the first time I've ever been there and I'm glad I did. I was told by a friend to try them out and it was great. I will be back soon. The staff was great and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"PROS:
-Attentive & friendly service 
-Cute decor!

FOOD 3/5:
-Corned beef hash ($10.50): My corned beef was shredded, and it tasted good. However, the corn beef & hashbrowns were WAY TOO SMALL. I finished it very quickly, unsatisfied.
-Country Fried Steak ($12.50): The sauce they had on top of the steak was amazing! And the steak wasn't too well-done, again everything was portioned :( 

CONS:
-The reason I'm getting this an average score is because the portions are pretty small. When you think of breakfast, you want a big meal to start your day and this place doesn't give you enough food... I left feeling hungry again lol"}
{"text":"I had the protein omelete,half order of french toast and fresh squeezed orange juice. The food was ok a bit tasteless but the oj was good.  The service was a bit bland as well the staff didnt check to see how everything was after i got my food or see if i wanted another oj....which i did."}
{"text":"Four of us met for breakfast so we could try several items on their menu.  We ordered their beer cakes, funfetti pancakes, the Ultimate pancake, Monte Cristo French toast, chocolate mocha waffle, banana nut French toast, and one mint chocolate pancake to give the flavor a try.

My favorite of the group was the chocolate mocha waffle.  Next I would put the Monte Cristo French toast and followed closely by the banana nut French toast.  I tasted some of the other cakes, too, except the beer cakes.  For the most part, they each had some sort of hook to make them different and appeal especially to the younger set.

Service was not good.  Coffee was not refilled in a timely manner, the one stack of pancakes was not topped with the yogurt the menu promises, and we were brought a wrong pancakes instead of the French toast we ordered.

There are too many spots in the southwest/Summerlin areas from which to choose and while I grade it 3 stars, it was OK--just OK--not A-OK!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent brunch here for Father's Day and only had to wait 25 minutes (Not bad) for a table for four. 

Coffee is delicious here and orange juice taste fresh. Our server was excellent I forgot her name. Didn't have to wait for our meal more than 10 minutes. 

I would recommend this place and will be returning back soon."}
{"text":"Super attentive and extra warm with their welcome. The owner even asked us our opinion on which juices we'd like to see on the menu for next time. If you go you have to try the corned beef has, It's !!!!!  I Highly recommend this place and can't wait to bring my family here when they come in from out of town. Vegas needs more breakfast spots like this!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food here! They have every kind of pancake you could imagine, and their eggs Benedict are cooked to perfection every time. They also have the option of tortillas for your \"bread\" selection, so I sometimes make my Mexican omelette into little breakfast tacos. There is also a nice selection of fresh squeezed juices that are served in cool mason jars. The staff is beyond friendly, and the owner comes out and talks to the customers if it's not too busy. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the atmosphere could use some upgrading. You almost get a cafeteria feel when you walk inside, but the food and service makes up for the lack of pizzazz. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in las vegas! Daily specials that will start your day off right. Fresh squeezed juice and a corn beef hash like no other. Dre the owner goes out of his way to make you feel like home. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. Give it a try you won't be disappointed! Can't wait to go back and try their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Hands down 5 the best!!! I wish I could give 10 stars. Carlos was our waiter and was super cool and helpful about question we had on the menu, but the whole staff was awesome. But man the FOOD... So good. I told them I wish they would open a place in long beach lol. Everything we tried so delicious and fresh!!! Will make a point to come back here every one in in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Bite juices are to die for
Super fresh fast and so tasty!
The service is impeccable and the atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. Great for breakfast or a fast and wholesome lunch definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Where has this breakfast gem been hiding? Stumbled upon it and now this is my spot! Had the most amazing corn beef hash and lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberries.  Absolutely delicious and believe me im a food snob from chicago so I know food.  Love the menu and your ability to pick and choose half orders. Very flexible here. Service was outstanding. Little bit of raegae music in the background...nice touch. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"2nd Mother's Day in a row and service and food was amazing as always"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast before hiking and they did not disappoint. We both ordered skillets and orange juice which were really good. The orange juice was fresh squeezed and you could definitely tell. The staff was extremely nice the entire time. They were quick to help with anything we needed. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Even better service. If you are reading this and considering eating here, do it. 

If you are on the strip and are looking for an amazing breakfast, make the drive to here. We did, and we feel the best that we did while on our vacation."}
{"text":"Average meal, and given the precious Yelp reviews I was expecting a bit more that what I received.  A good place, but not a great one...."}
{"text":"Bite is cute. We had really nice friendly service. It's a laid back atmosphere that's very family friendly. 

The portions are huge. We shared the banana nut french toast combo and the chicken fried steak. We took 2/3 of the french toast home. It was scrumptious but cold. The chicken fried steak was literally a breaded and fried steak so the texture was tough but the flavor was outstanding. The bacon/sausage gravy was yummy but salty. Everything is certainly homemade and they have a big menu to choose from. There is no specialty coffee which is always disappointing at a breakfast establishment. People need lattes! They did offer flavored creamed though. 

Some small complaints but I would certainly return for a yummy low key breakfast. Eggs, bacon and potatoes were cooked perfectly. Syrup was served warm which is always nice!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff,  my fiancee had a problem with her food and they switched it without a problem , really a must try and we will be coming back"}
{"text":"Tiny portion. Bland taste. $3 for dripped coffee. My sister and I ordered 2 omelette and 2 coffee. Total bill is $35 plus tip. Should have gone to MacDonald instead. Worst breakfast place in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing.  I literally can't believe that this place isn't completely on waiting list for hours at all times.  Their specials are always just incredible.  And I've had a wide variety of what's on their menu and everything has been great.  Trust me go here and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Bookmark Checked!!!

Bite has been a bookmark since they opened in 2015.  It's now 2017 and I'm just now reviewing them. It really doesn't take much for a breakfast joint to please me.  Eggs, bacon, a decent steak, and good service is all it takes for me to be satisfied.  Bite didn't fail with me.  The service was awesome from start to finish.  We were seated immediately on a holiday morning.  Our server, Kristina, took care of us by taking our orders and keeping our drinks full. Be prepared to eat when you come here because your food is prepared/served with minimal wait.  The menu consist of your typical breakfast items, some colorful pancakes, and their signature stuffed steaks.  I was craving steak, bacon, and eggs.  So, my decision was an easy one...the Stuffed Steak w/Eggs & Bacon and Hash Browns.  My main dish consist of a couple of eggs & bacon that's wrapped by a thin piece of steak.  Imagine having a breakfast burrito, but instead of tortilla, it's wrapped by 6 oz. of steak.  Yes, that's what I got.  I'm a protein lover and if you are too, then you'll love this combination.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal and see myself coming back.  If I can afford the calories, then I'll try their pancakes too.  

2017 Yelp Review #2"}
{"text":"Bite is a solid breakfast spot which has earned it a regular recurrence in my breakfast rotation.  It's close to my gym and I regularly pop in after my Saturday morning workout because I like to immediately consume all the calories I just burned.  

It's always crowded, but table turnover is quick, so the wait time is not too bad.  Coffee is strong and hot and the food is great comfort food.  Think diner food with a Mexican influence.  My favorites are the steak and eggs and the chilaquiles.  The fresh pressed juices are a pleasant surprise, as is the homemade salsa.  Prices are a tad high but the quality of food justifies the price point.  I am a firm believer of you get what you pay for and the food is fresh-made and worth the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the Yelp reviews, and it was phenomenal! Had 5 people at breakfast and everyone loved their food. We tried the Monte Cristo Eggs Benedict (so creative and tasty!), the Bites Benedict (the chipotle hollandaise was to die for), Corned Beef Hash (with real corned beef!), the black bean burger (homemade!), and a kids portion of funfetti pancakes and eggs. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was great here! Funfetti pancakes were unbelievably amazing!! Corned beef hash was excellent. Good prices. Fantastic place to eat! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"When we first arived it was a bit smokey. It was busy buy we have a child was was coughing.  I also heard the table next to us complain about there eyes. Even with the door open it was a little extreme.  A little better ventilation could go a long way.

    At first I thought we would have to wait a while because they were packed, and sadly there was a very small waiting area woth a few bar stools, and could turn into a stressful situation fast.

     After we sat down there was multiple people coming up to the table that worked there, but none of them would take our order due to the fact they were not are server. Which was very confusing because it seems like nobody knew who our server was. After a 15 minute wait in asking the lady in the back, there was finally someone at our table to take our order.

    After we had placed our order our waiter had returned back to the table to let us know that a couple of the meals we had ordered they no longer had the product to service our food. After we continue to name a few orders he continued to tell us that they were out of potatoes they're out of hamburger meat and so on and so on.


    After an hour and a half of seeing employees run around confused and upset at each other they finally started to bring out ourfood after most of the restaurant what's gone already. Even after they thought they had the situation handled with our table they still continued to mess up even after we were the only ones left in the restaurant. My wife was pregnant and ask to have her steak medium well after she had received her steak the steak was medium rare. Also a few minor things like, we receive the appetizer after the entrees, & they forgot my kids meal all together.

   And to make the situation even better as people were getting up and leaving before we received our food an old lady had slipped and fallen flat on her face due to the fact the restaurant floor was dirty.

  And my final word is the whole reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is because the service was horrible but the food was phenomenal and after all that I have gone through for the horrible service I would definitely try and come back for some of the items on the menu. The food was delicious and their menu was very creative. I even took some of my favorite classic meals and put a spin on it. Plus the servers were very apologetic but, sadly sorrys don't fix bad service.

  At least would even considered giving this restaurant 3 to 4 stars if management would have came out and spoke with us and try to make the situation better or just simply hear an apology from the manager himself and making sure that everything will be on point would put some comfort into the situation

   There is also something about seeing our waiter rolled his eyes pull his hair and go crazy over the fact that services are going well makes the situation ten times more stressful.

My best advice is if you want to eat at this restaurant, call ahead to make sure they're not busy so you don't have to go to the nightmare I had to go through.

Sorry guys...."}
{"text":"The sweet potato waffles were amazing!! You get hot syrup brought to your table with whipped butter.  Good atmosphere.  Service was perfect & I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was great, had the hazelnut pancakes and I definitely wasn't disappointed. The juice is fresh pressed. The orange juice and apple lemon ginger were insane good. The service was also excellent regularly checked up on us to make sure we were okay. Definitely coming back to check out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Quality food , amazing service , greeted every time by the owner and sat quickly , food comes out to perfect I'm a loyal customer and will not go anywhere els. Juice is pressed fresh daily , price is right as well. If they run out of don't have what you want will always accommodate or put it on the list for future reference . What more can you can you say this deserves more than 5 star's.

{"text":"Originally when this place opened everything was fantastic. I went back and was pretty disappointed. What happened to the banana nut french toast? It's not the thick, moist decadent option that I remembered. My flat toast like pieces were dry and grainy. White gravy could use a revamp. Transitional patch? The high rating I gave does not represent current day. 

I will say their orange juice is outstanding but they could certainly benefit from replacing their tops with a straw hole. Those can be picked up at hobby lobby in the glass area."}
{"text":"Cool spot, been here about five times. I appreciate the coffee options, regular brew or press coffee. The food is generous and delicious! Also get the bread in a cup, I cannot remember what it's named. They have cool gifts too, we have bought a couple pairs of socks for friends! I love the decor! Oh and they have a patio!"}
{"text":"Crazy cool hole in the wall place, with an incredibly creative menu.. worth the drive out to eat here.. try the cold press juices.. incredible!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the top 5 brunch spots in west Las Vegas. Incredible food and awesome service will leave you in a good mood every time. Excellent ambiance as well, this place never fails to make me smile . If you're in the mood for a sugary start to your day get the Churro French Toast!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas! They feature an array of fresh squeezed juices. If you're on the strip, make the trip."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here. The omelettes were delicious.  My mom really enjoyed her crepes. We've driven by this place many times. So we decided to come here for breakfast and we're not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Once again we were completely full and satified after dining at this delicious place!!"}
{"text":"BBQ Brisket Scramble was phenomenal!! It's a special so when they offer it order it!! My hubby who's a big time foodie said it's probably the best breakfast he's ever had! And we've dined everywhere including Commanders Palace to name one. 

Egg Florentine which was mine was also amazing, the sourdough toast that the poached eggs come on was thick but light and fluffy. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sauce was scrumptious. 

This is our 2x here and Bite will be a staple when we make our trips out from SoCal."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Easy parking, outstanding service, and incredible food!  My wife and I were visiting from Denver last week and looking for a nice breakfast.  We plan on making it our \"go to\" breakfast joint when visiting Summerlin in the future.  The seating arrangement is also perfect and it's not loud and noisy in there like a lot of places.  The \"Elvis\" is yummy as well as their house breakfast sandwich.  Definitely a must try if you are a local and appreciate easy parking and incredible food and service."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was just the same. I personally don't have any complaints for this breakfast place. I just wish they had one in SoCal. Must try the chilaquiles!"}
{"text":"Had the BEST service here! The food was great, too! 

Between the 6 of us in our party, we each got something a little different. From benedicts, to omelettes, cold pressed juices, chorizo, and pancakes...everything was delish!

What I really, really loved was how humble and gracious everyone was. They sincerely appreciated our business and made us feel like family. 

I think I've found my favorite \"off the strip\" brunch place. BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"Decor/Atmosphere 5 stars, service 5 starts, food presentation 5 stars, taste 3 stars.   For the person who likes large portions of very sweet prepared foods this is defiantly you place, if you like everything tasting like a desert then this should be you place.  I found it a little to much, lacking traditional flavors of what one would look for in a meal to start you day."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! Great service,  very friendly. Homemade corn beef hash is awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food and really good juices! I recommend better seasoning on the food and bigger portions. Clean place in cool shopping area.
Try the coconut water or fresh orange juice!"}
{"text":"I was shockingly surprised by this place. Obviously it has great reviews and has a lot of them, this seems like kind of a new place, but the price met the quality and the taste.

The 4star rating is perfect. You don't pay too much and you get a lot. What I like though is it isn't too heavy of a meal and I was able to eat all of it! there was so much great flavors too, I had the Huevos a la mexicana and i made my self some little breakfast tacos.

The eggs are fluffy and delicious the potatoes are on point and the bacon gravy is so freakin good. I didn't put it on biscuits because I was too cheap/lazy/not hungry enough, to eat it. I imagine they are delicious though!

THE VERDICT: this is a nice little breakfast joint that is worth a try and will safely protect your wallet. If you haven't gone... what are you waiting for!?!?! go right now... well actually it is kind of late... unless you are reading this in the morning... go right now!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast at this spot. It's not as healthy as others but the trade off is that it tastes amazing! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a week late on writing this review, but I have to say this restaurant is fantastic! From the staff to the food, to even the customers who are a table away from you! This visit was my husband and I's first time. We wanted to eat someplace new for breakfast and stumbled upon BITE on Yelp! I asked if the funfetti pancake was popular and for a first timer, it was! (This is also my favorite cake, so I just had to try!! :D) So I ordered the funfetti pancakes and added a combo to it (eggs & bacon) with a side of extra crispy hash browns. Our son, who is 9 months old, loved eating the eggs! ;) && my husband ate one of the skillets, turkey and guacamole one?!... Not only did they have delicious breakfast, but they also serve freshly made juices! I ordered the kale pineapple one and my husband had the kale Apple celery one. I liked his better, the server did too! but mine wasn't bad.. If you like more greens j recommend the kale pineapple one (there were other ingredients I just forgot them). If you're more on the fruity & sweet side I'd go with the apple celery one! On another note, early on just when our food came.... Out of no where... Our sons car seat flipped over & fell off the high chair (my son was trying to lean forward...-_-) but anyways the car seat fell on the floor ... Face down.. BUT LUCKILY our son didn't get hurt. My point is the service was super caring and worried for him that made this review 5 stars! The staff kept checking up on us and our son to make sure everything was okay and they were probably one of the most well trained & kind hearted employees at most restaurants. Thank you guys, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday at around 12pm. It was steady and the restaurant had almost every seat filled. From the moment I walked in the staff was very friendly and greeted me. They also seated me right away and while they walked me to the table they asked if I wanted coffee and water. In less than 2 minutes the waitress came with my coffee and said she would be right back to take my order.  I ordered the three egg breakfast with seasoned potatoes, turkey bacon, and wheat toast. My order came out so quickly and it tasted great! Everything was nicely seasoned and nothing was overpowering. I didn't have any of their fresh squeezed juices that everyone else talks about but I'll definitely order some next time. 

Overall the food was great and the staff was friendly and very attentive. I definitely recommend coming here for a nice brunch. Thank you to everyone at Bite!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place that even offers bottomless mimosas!! We were greeted immediately as we walked in the door which was very nice. They had extra staff on hand to make sure we always had water and helped clear tables/plates. One down side is when we went the credit card reader was broken so it was cash only, not a big problem but after our plates were cleared we asked for the check, he said sure and 25 minutes later I stopped someone passing our table asking about the check. He said that the printer wasn't working and we had to go to the counter. Again all of that is fine but it was slightly frustrating that we waited so long to find that out. Food was amazing and very filling! Would highly recommend just make sure the card reader and printer work."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place this morning for breakfast. There was a little wait when we arrived, but I assume it was the owner, was very nice and made sure we had options on seating in the mean time. When we were seated the server got our drink orders right away. Bummed they didn't serve mimosas, but their orange juice was fresh! Coffee was yummy. We ordered the steak roll and corn beef hash. Good size portions. Food was fresh and yummy. Service was great. Food delicious and came our fairly quick. I would definitely recommend this place and I would be back to try other food items."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place due to rave reviews, but left thinking it was just average. 
The Nutella pancake was good, monte Christo was just average, and the chicken and waffle was just okay as well. The service was also terrible--somehow our waiter took forever to come to us, and we witnessed a table of 6 getting their food before us when they sat down AFTER us. 

Sorry Bite, I just wasn't blown away for my brekkie time."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say Bravo!  Coffee is good, strong with a choice of creams (hazelnut, my fave), fruit bowl was larger than expected, syrup was Warm, a rarity these days, server was very attentive And respectful. Even offers a coffee to go without me even asking!  Lastly the food portion is more than enough. The plate length is almost as long as the table width."}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best customer service we've ever had! Ivan is always so nice and helpful and the fresh OJ here is amazing! Highly recommend. The Moe's breakfast wrap is really nice and light. And the bone in ham steak is fantastic! You won't regret eating here."}
{"text":"Love Bite for breakfast and lunch. Great food and amazing staff. Been going there for years."}
{"text":"This morning I had breakfast with my mom and my sister and we wanted to try something good for a change. I am really sick of the same breakfast place with a new stupid name slapped on but basically its something Egg or something Cake, and the food is boring and unoriginal. I've seen Bite a few times driving by and was curious about it and since I was the one driving today I decided to go here. I loved everything even down to the simple breakfast potatoes. My mom had the chilaquiles and the verde sauce was obviously made in house and was exceptional. My sister had a wrap, I don't know what kind but within 5 minutes she inhaled the whole thing so i guess it was good. I ordered the breakfast steak burrito thing, filling of eggs, cheese and veggies. I usually don't order steak for breakfast but this was something unique to the menu so I wanted to be brave. The steak was seasoned and tender and the portion was large enough to share. Also we all wanted to try the pancakes and dammit those were good too. They even served them with warmed syrup in a recycled Crown Royal bottle which was so unique and adorable. Love this place, friendly and cute staff, all around great place, great food, very chill and comfortable atmosphere. Definitely my new spot."}
{"text":"Not bad, not that great. Like any other breakfast place, I would say. I know I can't compare their chilaquiles to my mom's, however I feel they can improve. I had the chicken chilaquiles, they are served with rice and beans on the side, avocado, pico, sour cream and cheese. 
Sometimes \"less is more\", and I feel they could improve a little more on the flavor. I had a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes my friends got, and they were just ok too. Their customer service is exceptional, and we got our food in less than 10 minutes :)"}
{"text":"Every time I come and eat, the service is great and the food is always finger lickin' good. My kids always say, \"I'll have the usual!\"Either their chocolate mint pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, or the chicken tenders are so delicious! My husband cannot get enough of their one of a kind corn beef hashed for breakfast, their juices are so healthy, and my favorite omelet is THE FAVORITE!! amazing, all of it, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried this on a whim, and was not disappointed.  Had the Gatspy burger for lunch and it came out fresh and cooked to order. The staff was very personable and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout from here for breakfast and to say the least I was fairly impressed. When I came in there were quite busy but it smelled wonderful in there. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. 

My food was still hot when I got home which is always a plus when it comes to take out! I devoured my corn beef has which really hit the spot! My girlfriend orders the steak and eggs, her steak was a little chewy but not too bad overall. 

I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.
We Went in a Sunday morning, and was seated straight away... It was busy but no wait. (party of 3)
I tried the Drey's Corned Beef Hash. It was amazing, real shredded corned beef, no can'd garbage.
The service was outstanding, and all the employees were very upbeat and friendly.
A great place for breakfast, we can't wait to come again and try lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly service!! Great food with a mexican twist!! It kinda feels like I'm seating at my moms kitchen table!! Just wish they were open later!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  I had the home made banana nut bread French toast with bacon and eggs. Outstanding flavor and more than enough to eat!!!  Clean restaurant clean rest rooms. Friendly service and atmosphere.   If your hungry stop in!"}
{"text":"Such a good place for anything. It's an amazing place to go grab any sort of food. Owner is an amazing guy and really personable"}
{"text":"Food is great also with the great service.. Wait staff if very helpful and nice..

LOVE that they have fresh juice"}
{"text":"I had the 2 egg breakfast. The hashbrowns had this amazing seasoning on them. The eggs were quality and fluffy. Definitely delicious all around...  that was my first review. Unfortunately I went back and it was a total miss! So many things went wrong. We were seated but didn't see our server for about 10 minutes. Ordered food for 3 people. We only got half of it. They forgot to ring in my son's pancakes and both of our sides. So me and my husband got our breakfast without sides and my son got nothing. Took almost 10 minutes for them to give him his pancakes. My food was just ok. Eggs were pretty badly burnt and my hashbrowns were undercooked and under seasoned. Very disappointing experience. Then at the end they didn't bother to comp my son's pancakes or offer us anything in return for the poor food and service. Just rude."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and service is great. I ordered the Benedict with chorizo and chipotle hollandaise, I highly recommend it. Our server was friendly and attentive and our food came out fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast. It was our first time here and won't be our last. We did the all you can eat breakfast menu and it was great to be able to try all the options. I really enjoyed the San Diego Benny and my husband really liked the egg, bacon, sausage crepe. We both loved the churro French toast. 
The restaurant itself was also very clean and the staff is super friendly. 
Definitely recommend for a breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Bite was a huge disappointment today. I was in town visiting family and decided to stop by and get a bite to eat, when I lived in Las Vegas this place was a routine meeting and hang out spot for breakfast. The quality of food and service has declined so much since the last time I ate here.  The service was slow, and it took the food about 35 to 40 minutes to get to the table. The food was subpar and on the level of an IHOP or Denny's. The potatoes were over salted and seasoned, and rest of the food was bland. The staff were wandering around the restaurant, and they seem to be disorganized and also distracted by the soccer game on the TV. Sadly, I will not be coming back to Bite nor will I recommend this place anymore."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Horrible service and barely edible food sums it up. There was a lot of hype on this place and we were excited to try Bite out. After a reasonable wait for seating, we were serviced by an incompetent waitress who didn't know the menu and also didn't know how to input our order into their POS system. 

People being seated way after us were receiving their orders while we just sat there getting more and more frustrated. When our orders finally did come, two out of the four dishes came out incorrect. After finally getting to taste the food, I can honestly say that disappointed was a gross understatement. The French toast had so much cinnamon on it that it was bitter. The pancakes were deformed and dry like cardboard. I had to use half the bottle of syrup to be able to eat the pancakes without choking. The chicken fried steak was tough like a shoe. My friend could barely cut it with a knife.

Needless to say, I will not be back. It's fairly difficult to screw up breakfast items but we got hit with the double whammy of bad service and food."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay. I Had the Eggs Benedict and I thought it was pretty small for the price they had it for."}
{"text":"Been eyeing this place for a while now. The pictures of the food always look so good! And it was! Carlos was a great server. My husband and I had fresh squeezed juice, the health nut scramble and the Benedict with a chorizo sauce! I will be back."}
{"text":"My new breakfast place. I've finally found you!!!! Praise jeebus!

Where to start:

Waitstaff - super friendly, amazingly attentive, laid back, funny, great suggestions on their menu. You can tell they are very familiar with the food, and take pride in the quality and the taste. 

THE JUICE. 
If you come here and don't order from their fresh juice menu, you fail at life. 
I ordered the Apple Lemon Ginger and my god...heaven in my mouth. For only 4.99 this is a steal. Good luck finding that price anywhere else. AND it comes in a giant mason jar. It's a PINT. A PINT OF JUICE FOR $4.99!!! 

THE FOOD. 
I got the two egg breakfast with egg whites and turkey bacon. Never in my life have I seen two eggs this size. Incredible value. Hash browns are adorable - little thing sliced pieces of potatoey goodness. You can order them extra crispy as well. It was so much food that I had to take it home. 

I left Bite feeling like I just got a giant breakfast hug."}
{"text":"The food was good nothing to write home about but the service was excellent . Everyone was super nice and helpful . The location was great however their chairs are a bit uncomfortable. I always drink my coffee black and their coffee was great . It's worth checking out ."}
{"text":"Mediocre and overpriced. I love breakfast foods and was really excited to try this place because of the amazing reviews. It turned out to be a disappointment. I could have easily made better at home. The red potatoes tasted like they had been sitting under a warmer and the pancakes tasted slightly under done. The place was pretty empty for a Saturday morning around 10. So maybe I should have taken that as a sign and went somewhere else. On the plus side, the fresh squeezed orange juice tasted good and the staff were super friendly. Overall, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Service is always quick and friendly. The food is excellent.  Has the chilaquiles last time and they were extremely tasty.  This visit went for the traditional breakfast.  Eggs and hash browns.  Both well done and good servings.  Tried the corn beef hash too.  That was great.   If you want fresh juices this is also a good place.   There is nothing like freshly squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, due to the high rating, and awesome reviews! Although, I have to say my experience here wasn't up to par to what I was expecting. I came in on a Sunday, at 9:45, and we had to wait ten minutes to be seated. Granted, the place was busy, but there were clean tables ready for customers, that just remained open. Once seated, we had to wait twenty minutes to get our order in, even our server knew that the timing to get our order in was really bad, as he profusely apologized about the wait. Another thirty minutes to wait until we finally got our food, and I knew it was a bad sign when we saw people who were already seated before us, still waiting for their food. Our food looked delicious, although once we finally got it, our food was cold, and with the open kitchen, I saw our food waiting to be picked up for about ten minutes. If the food had been served to us warm, I know it would've been so much more tastier! It makes a huge difference when you bite into your chicken sliders, or your eggs, and its cold.The servers, I could tell were doing the best they could, because it seemed like they were short staffed. The wait, and the cold food made me feel like a one time trip to this restaurant was more than enough."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot. The place is very small definitely not for big groups and kids. The service was not superb but decent. The are very tech savvy if you're into that. They take your order and payments on ipads. The food was good the music was great. because it is so small and cramped it can get loud."}
{"text":"You have to order the fresh juice! I ordered the fried chicken and eggs with a side of cinnamon raisin bread and it all exceeded my expectations. Everything was cooked to perfection. The staff is extremely welcoming and they are always there when you need a refill or want to order something more. The only downside of this restaurant is that it is not put together very well. The furniture is kind of blah and the vibe isn't as cool and impressive as the staff and food. I hope this place gets more attention so they can start to upgrade their physical appearance: new chairs, tables, artwork on the walls, etc. Nonetheless, be sure not to overlook this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Quality food and fresh squeezed beverages.  Creative menu items with a homemade touch."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. I've been here countless times and they never fail me. It's one of those places you have to tell all of your friends about. Even their fresh juices and choice of music is the best! I love hearing reggae music at breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"I found my new spot for breakfast. The Steak Chilaquiles are  amazing.  The place is clean, services is wonderful. Will be back soon.  Next time I'll try the fresh squeeze juice."}
{"text":"I was seriously craving a Monte Cristo sandwich and not many places serve them. Bite was close and some place new so I knew we had to try it! The place looked familiar to me (used to be Pasta Fresh) I was sad when it shut down. 

I knew what I came here for but looking over the menu almost made me change my mind....ooh green pancakes! I was trying to talk my husband into getting them for his meal but he pretty much always gets some kind of omelet everytime. It was hard to choose but I stood by my Monte Cristo craving.

I've ordered this type of sandwich only once before so I expected it to come with raspberry sauce because I thought that was the norm. The waiter brought out some warm maple syrup for me to drizzle. It was different but still tasty. I like the savory salty and sweet  mixture. 

When I looked over the menu I noticed a couple of items that I would love to come back and try soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always awesome.  Always try the special! I always try to get breakfast here when I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good customer service. Busy, but seats still open for brunch on Saturday. Gave it two stars for the food. The food was cold and not good. Disappointed because we went there based on the good Yelp rating."}
{"text":"I ate here a bit ago. Staff was friendly but everything went pretty wrong. There was a dirty rag with Clorox sitting on our table the entire time .. asked a few times until it was moved. All of our food came our after 30 minutes and everything was cold especially my food Even my hash browns which were soggy. I had to send it back and got my next order back after my family was done eating..... manager apologized and offered a small comp which was later not applied then changed the option. Everyone was friendly and apologetic so I appreciate owning up to mistake and doing best to fix but Saturday morning breakfast with family visiting should be a nice experience... may give it another try one day but still pretty nervous"}
{"text":"Amazing food here. Fun little spot with good music and chill vibes. 

Tore up some chilaquiles and three different French toasts: churro, cinnamon roll, banana peanut butter.. 

Everything was spot on with great service and solid coffee as well!

Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"When we visited Vegas to see family, they suggested this restaurant as one of their favorite breakfast places to eat. Yes!!! Their breakfast was delicious and they have the best cinnamon pancakes. The serving sizes were so large, we were able to take leftovers home with us. Not a lot of gluten free options, but if I remember correctly, they served my breakfast with corn tortillas instead of toast! I was so thrilled! Yummy!! I even bought one of their cool tanks as a souvenir, to take home with me!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I just happened to come across it and tried it out. Everything was amazing. The chilaquiles were so good. The chips stayed crispy. Also had the gatsby burger and it was so full of flavor. I can't wait to go back and try some pancakes."}
{"text":"Looking for a new breakfast restaurant,  yelp steered us over to Bite. Good atmosphere, great service, great management, great food.  I found the coffee to be strong and hot like coffee should be @ a breakfast restaurant.  Didn't have to request refills. The  server was on it.  The juices are fresh squeezed and served in a mason jar. Great for shaking it up. I ordered the oj. Tasted sweet, tangy and fresh. The wait was minimul on everything. Food brought out quickly. Everything was hot and everything came out together.  The banana bread french toast was beautiful.  Loved the flavour.  My husband got the  funfetti pancakes.  He claims they are so good it must be \"witchery\". The syrup is kept warm and if the sryup cools down, they bring a new hot container.  Nothing worse than cold syrup on pancakes.  Everyone at Bite seemed like they enjoy there job. Smiles everywhere. Very professional with out losing their warmth.  We had a wonderful time conversing with the owners and the staff. We will most definatly be back and highly recommend this spot to everyone."}
{"text":"Before coming here I read the reviews. They had a 4.7 rating and they earned every bit of it! 
This place was great. Starting with food, I had the homemade chicken fried steak. The gravy was the best I have ever had with a nice mellow smokiness from the bacon in it. The steak was perfectly breaded and tender. Too often you tons of breading and no meat, not the case here!
Our service was perfect! We had a very cheerful girl named Sandra who took great care of us! I highly recommend this place, it will soon be my regular spot!"}
{"text":"We got there around 2pm, after the rush. They were out of multi-grain pancakes, sweet potato waffles, and almond milk. No almond milk means no coffee for me. I usually take a star away from any place that runs out of product, but I won't this time. The service was excellent and the server was very pleasant.

All of our meals were very good.

The signature stuffed steak was good. It looked like a piece of sirloin wrapped around a veggie omelette. I should have told them to cook my steak med-rare. My bad. It was very good though and it was served with the house potatoes.

The veggie eggs Benedict were also good. I have had better hollandaise sauce.

The cornbread waffle and chicken was excellent!!! I would recommend that everyone try's it. You won't be disappointed.

I will definitely be back to try more menu items and get some more chicken & waffles. I probably want to get there early next time before they run out of multigrain pancakes and almond milk."}
{"text":"I urge everyone to come and try Bite!

It's fairly new, and the interior decor is slightly inconsistent, but the atmosphere is homey, and the service is above excellent! There's nothing like eating at a place that is both warm and welcoming.

Speaking of eating, our food was delicious! We wanted lunch (it was around 9:50 AM) and were happy to find that they serve all of the menu items all throughout the day. We had Bianca's Favorite (a vegetable curry served over rice) and Eggs Florentine (sourdough toast with eggs, tomato, gravy, and a side of potatoes). Our plates were licked clean!

We'd definitely be returning soon even if it wasn't close to home."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, clean atmosphere and the food is fresh and not too greasy. Been to this place for breakfast three times now and every time the service has been consistent."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Summerlin and Bite has become our go-to spot for weekend breakfast. They offer everything you could possibly expect for breakfast and more. The staff is amazingly polite, professional and always with a sunny disposition. The food is delicious and always comes to our table in a reasonable amount of time.

We've noticed more and more diners with each visit, yet they're never packed to capacity where we need to wait for a table. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Bite has become a breakfast staple for me and my boyfriend. The food is so delicious and the menu is really fun and creative. Try the churro French toast! Every staff member is super friendly too so it's an all around wonderful experience every time you come in."}
{"text":"The artichoke omelet is very good.  You can't beat the service.  I was amazed at how many customers made changes on the menu offerings!  There were 4 other tables occupied and the  guests  asked  a lot of questions and made a lot of requests.  The waitress was very patient.  I love the menu and the specials, the food is very eclectic."}
{"text":"Really good food. Really good atmosphere. Service was good. Food was good portion size and very little oil. Fresh squeezed juice in mason jars was a huge plus for me (not a lot of places have this option). The food was so good I went there two days in a row for breakfast while I was in LV. Very well seasoned."}
{"text":"I read the great reviews of Bite and was excited to try it.  Interior is bare, minimal and I don't think inviting. Service was very good. I had 3 or 4 people taking care of me?? Not sure who's role was what , so that we confusing. Food was just ok. I had basic eggs and bacon with shredded hash browns which I thought were awful!  Only 2 pieces of bacon :(. I won't go back"}
{"text":"Very nice staff.  Great service.  The food is very good.  The mint chocolate chip pancakes were very good."}
{"text":"So decided to come back and let this place redeem itself and we started off as \"those people\" coming in 20 minutes before the place closed but we still were greeted quickly and with a lot of enthusiasm. 
Service was way better and the food was pretty good. Much better overall experience than last time and would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"The portion sizes are huge, the food is amazing and the service was impeccable. All of the servers checked on us not only our server so we never had a half full glass and the food came out so quickly. Everyone must try this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall quality of food and service gets 4 stars from me. The servers and hosts were friendly and inviting. Had a little bit of a wait at 10am on a Saturday but not too long. 

I had an omelet, hash browns and toast (pictured) and my son had the Monte Cristo and a side of hash browns. Both dishes arrived hot but again, a little bit of a longer wait than I would expect but the food was good. Fluffy warm omelet, big pieces of bacon mixed into the egg and not too much cheese. Hash browns were a thick, steel cut type and lightly seasoned but I like them with more salt so I just added. Good texture to the browns and a little bit of crunch. 

My son's Monte Cristo (pictured) was different than what I would expect as it resembled more of a French toast sandwich with turkey, big thick ham slice and cheese in between two pieces of French toast rather than a sandwich dipped in French toast batter and grilled. Still good though with the warm syrup they serve in a \"pour yourself\" glass bottle brought to the table. 

We will go back so we can try what looked like some awesome pancakes, especially the ones with banana, pecans and coconut. That warm syrup calls my name. 

One star was lost though because of the number of people who today just let their kids run wild around the tables in what is a pretty small place. It's a Saturday so maybe another day would be better. Put differently, if you're looking for a kid friendly place, on today, Bite was the place."}
{"text":"This place was so bomb! Loved their breakfast. The banana nut bread French toast was so good. Will definitely be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"They say third times a charm... and that was definitely true for us. The first 2 times I picked things to eat that were good but not my first choice. I finally went ahead and ordered exactly what I've been wanting to try and was not disappointed. San Diego addiction.. go get some! 
And the sweetest service... Carlos was so patient with me and my baby boy"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great staff. Decided to yelp a breakfast place and found this place is right down the street from my house. The staff was fast and service was prompt."}
{"text":"The ambiance is confusing. The chairs and benches are different heights making the seating odd. The chairs and tables are similar to an old diner. There is one sign and an attempt at trendy lighting. None of the above work together. The food was subpar. (We got their signature omelette, which my friend was was really disappointing, and pancakes, which was an average pancake.) I asked for 3 different drinks on the menu and the server left to ask each time and said they didn't have them... each time. I don't know if she understood me well so the last time I pointed at the menu and then she got it. Everyone was smilie and nice, but little things were off. No eye contact, waiting for check, etc. Don't see this lasting long unless they fix the basics."}
{"text":"Food AND service was excellent!
I had the Favorite omlette with sun dried tomatoes, avocado, spinach and basil. Basil?! Yes! It just made the whole thing perfect. Also with a side of red fried potatoes and cinnamon toast. The potatoes were fresh, not frozen (biggest pet peeve of mine) and cooked to perfection. The bread didn't even need to be toasted, it was light and fluffy. I'm in love with this new place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed at the food and service.  Waited 1 hour for breakfast and the restaurant wasn't that busy.  The beans in the beef fajitas taste \"canned\", the ham steak was ridiculously salty and the coffee was cold."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast basics... and some interesting twists on the menu. There's something about a steak rolled up with breakfast stuff like eggs and stuff. I had an omlet. It was good. My bf had the waffle cristo.... really good! Next time we need to try that steak thing and bottomless mimosas for sure."}
{"text":"Great customer service, funky and hip setup, great music. Hand squeezed juices in mason jars  Food was awesome!!!!! Great find!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic breakfast spot. The servers are the most friendly and accommodating people ever (they set up a table outside just for us so that our dog could be with us) and their food is DELICIOUS. Inside is a bit small but the service is so fast. This is our new favorite breakfast spot while we're in town and it's so convenient on the way to Red Rock!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, excellent coffee and food.  We wound up splitting the cornbread chicken and waffles special because it was so much food, but it was also absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The food was great. There were so many options to choose from (which is good and bad) haha but everything was great. The place was really cute inside and clean. The service was awesome all of the staff was amazing and we were well taken care of. They also have fresh squeezed juices which usually aren't the yummiest especially when green but these were amazing! Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"So my friend introduced me to this place and the logo is adorable but at first walking in it looks like one of those diners you see in a TV show. The space is actually quite small, and I've been twice and it's been busy both times! We had to stand and wait a while and even the service involves some wait. 

However, the food is excellent! They have a very good and interesting menu! The omelets are amazingly super yummy! It was a omelette with cheese, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, and some other things! It as very delicious and my friend had another omelet that was equally delicious. My other friend had one of the sweeter pancakes. They were yummy and cooked in a good size. Although, once I had the apple Carmel once and they put pretzel in it. I didn't think that it was that good because it was a weird combination and it dried out my mouth.

The service was good but there is a lot of waiting and they don't really keep track of the tables because of how busy they are. This is the only really bad thing there is about this place."}
{"text":"This is my usual Sunday breakfast/brunch spot.  I've tried a few different things on the menu but I always end up getting \"the favorite\" skillet.  Scrambled eggs, mushrooms, basil, sun dried tomato, with goat cheese.  I ask for the hash brown to be extra crispy and I couldn't have a more perfect breakfast.  

They have juices in their cooler as well, I believe they make it in the morning but sometimes I get a little thrown off with their apple juice being brown.  It makes me think they make it the day prior.

Other than that the service is great and they're really nice there!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. I don't know how we went so long without knowing this place was right under our noses. Bianca gave us extraordinary customer service, plus she makes the best juices! Definitely coming back for more funfetti pancakes too!"}
{"text":"excellent service.  Tasty food.  I got the chicken fried steak.  Was a little disappointed.  Very tough and the gravy was watery.  Hubby got a skillet.  Asked for the potatoes to be well done/crispy, but a little hard in the middle still.  Great place, we will go back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I try to go to a different breakfast place every week. The menu had a ton of different choices, I got the Wake and Bacon and my boyfriend got the Wet Burrito. The food was really yummy actually! Our server, Carlos, was also great. He was very attentive to us and one of the most respectful servers I've ever had. He made sure everything was going great and had our drinks constantly full."}
{"text":"I love Love Love this place. The food is fresh and always prepared delicious. 
I ordered the across the border omelette w a side biscuit and gravy and my friend ordered the pancake flight combo."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, took a breakfast to go and when I got home the eggs When addict"}
{"text":"Have been in several times and the food is always fresh and delicious. I will certainly be going back soon. Make sure to get the fresh juices!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service, food was on point, the stuffed steak I really recommend it, the fresh juices are good, and Carlos did a great job, he took good care of us, and cleared all my questions, he's a really cool guy, I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"A little hard to find, since this intersection is overloaded with places to eat. Suggestion to owners: Add \"next to Tropical Smoothie\" in description.

Meal was excellent. Got the traditional Eggs Benedict, and was relieved when it was traditional. Too many places try to put their own mark on traditional Benny, when all I want is the real deal.

Coffee is top notch, not always the case at breakfast places in Vegas.

I wanted to end with a little something sweet, not a full order of anything. They gladly served me a half order of French toast. Good ending to relaxing brunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop that has a little of everything, from fresh & healthy to sweet & savory! Had the churro waffles, (amazing)!! Also ordered the Some Like It Hot omelette and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I recently ate brunch at Bite Breakfast & Lunch and loved it. Andrey Ariza, the Chef & Owner, greeted us, took our orders, treated my daughters and I like family. The food and coffee was amazing. The waiter was great. I suggest you get off the strip and head over to Bite for a little bite of Las Vegas true hospitality and good food. Locals - you need to frequent Bite and support this great restaurant! It's located off West Flamingo and South Grand Canyon!"}
{"text":"Had a really pleasant breakfast with my boyfriend early Friday morning. The service was amazing and they were very friendly and extra helpful :) I had the chicken chilaquiles which had a nice, homemade verde salsa & my boyfriend had the French toast Benedict which was really unique and delicious! Definitely coming back for a fresh squeezed juice and a new breakfast."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We like trying new places to eat for breakfast but we keep coming back to this place. Food is so good, I love their Benedict plates and skillets. The staff here are very friendly and service is fast. I really love their music, they play reggae and island music, I feel a little at home. So overall, it's great service, great food, affordable pricing. It's our regular \"breakfast spot\". If you haven't check them out, I recommend you do so and grab a \"bite\". :)"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Nice atmosphere.  Open dining area consists of diner style tables and chairs.  We ordered breakfast items.  The coffee and pineapple juice beverages were very good.  The chicken and waffles were very good except we didn't realize it included chopped scallions so we took those off quickly as we don't like the flavor of raw onions/scallions on anything.  The ham steak was huge and good.  I asked for eggs over medium and they were okay but not cooked enough to my taste.  The bacon was cooked well but had an overly smokey flavor that we did not prefer.  The maple syrup was brought to the table in a stylized glass container with pouring spout.  However, the flavor of the maple syrup was disappointing.  My immediate thought was the syrup was either a special house blend or was diluted; the flavor was weak.  The hash browns were okay.  Overall we enjoyed the breakfast but will not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Always excellent service and brunch. Now with a wide variety of mimosas!

Favorite so far is the corned beef."}
{"text":"My son recommended this place & we were a little skeptical because its in a strip mall by Target, but he was right. Great breakfast! I had the blueberry pancakes with eggs & bacon. Yum! Light & fluffy pancakes & eggs cooked to perfection. My husband had the steak wrapped around chorizo & eggs with hash browns & he loved it. I'd say we will be back again & again"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, but mediocre at best. 
The freshly squeezed juice is awesome 
But the stuffed steak was ok. 
The pancakes were alright. 
I wouldn't go back for food, but I would go for the juices. 
Our server was awesome. 
I felt bad cause he was taking orders, running food, And being the cashier. 
He must be so tired after a day. I bet he was cooking too lol"}
{"text":"We were quite disappointed with our stop in for brunch. I had bookmarked Bite and my hubby was so excited to try it. We didn't quite feel comfortable waking in the door. The customer service was okay, quite awkward trying to figure out who our waiter was. Ordered banana bread French toast, it was pretty flavorless. They also serve hot syrup which I cannot stand (but totally A me preference) my hubby ordered the biscuits and bacon gravy. We weren't impressed, definitely needed some seasoning. For the price it's definitely not worth it for us. I hope this was only our experience! The atmosphere was cute and the bathrooms clean. I didn't like how they brought an iPad to the table to pay, it was really awkward."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and good food big portions great little cafe will be back.
Little loud inside because it was crowded so we sat outside and it was great also bottomless mimosas"}
{"text":"Corn beef & hash was the bomb, none of that shit from a Can! Also the strawberry cream cheese French Toast was definitely on a another level of delicious"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. Everything I have ordered was delicious. 

They just need to get new tea kettles Bc they spill all over the table !! Also I wish it was open 24 hours lol"}
{"text":"This is not the best breakfast place I have been, but it is definitely a good one. We were looking for a place early on a Sunday morning and this place had the least wait. We were sat and the services and stuff were slow, but in all fairness they were slammed. The food was pretty decent. It will not be my first choice, but definitely will return if the other places around are slammed."}
{"text":"Second time around and now I'm family...all good
Lol but no one gets a free pass when I spend money...
So with my second review....THUMBS UPS!!!
Pork chops excellent hazelnut pancakes good
Jasmine mint chocolate chip great again 
Service excellent again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, coffee could use some help (watery), delicious food options!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. This was my first visit and I  will  be  back. Coffee  is delicious  and the food  servings  are generous .  Staff are all friendly and  attentive .  Such a pleasure and no rush to turn tables even  though  people  were waiting ."}
{"text":"The ultimate pancakes!!!! Delicious! Who puts their egg on top of their pancakes? I used to do that too until now. Went to Bite and had the Ultimate Pancakes and holy moly!! Look no further the egg was cooked inside the pancakes with sausage and bacon sprinkled on top and in the batter - looooved it! Pancakes were yummy, egg was cooked perfectly and it is served with warm syrup. Fresh squeezed/pressed juices served in mason jars were refreshing and delicious.

Service was great, waiters/waitresses were super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Tried Bite this morning with my wife. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Their menu offered a large variety of appealing choices- including vegetarian options- which made deciding what to order a little difficult.  I decided to order the Caramel Apple Waffles which came out quickly with lovely presentation and tasted like the delicious love child of a Belgium waffle and a churro. 

We will definitely be coming back and recommending Bite to our friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here and really enjoyed it! I loved the atmosphere and decor, and the service was great (I believe our server's name was Carlos?) I would definitely return. Bring cash!!!! They don't accept card."}
{"text":"Really excellent food with bold flavors!! Definitely expensive for what it is though. $75.00 for a family of four with 2 adults a baby and a 4 year old is a little excessive. 

The corn beef hash is to die for and the funfetti pancakes are very good as well. I just can't believe how much they charge for breakfast! Be aware when going they charge for every little thing."}
{"text":"This resturant was amazing! The food menue was unique, creative and DELICOUS! The fresh press juices were outstanding! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and continue to go back over and over again! Everything was fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday around 11:30am. Not busy at all, playing some good vibes reggae music. Ordered the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, hash browns, and wheat toast. The toast was bomb! The chicken fried steak was actually a steak.  Usually you get the ground beef steak but this was actually a steak. The hash browns were interesting.  Kind of like a deconstructed hash brown. Decent. The scrambled eggs were sub par. Got gouged for a $3 crappy small coffee.  I would give this place a 3.5 stars but they deserve the round up."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had breakfast at \"bite\"... A new breakfast and lunch place on Grand Canyon (4165). There was a coupon in the R-J for a buy one get one free, and I usually use those to try new places or old favorites. We had not been to bite before so decided to try it. Absolutely awesome! Great selection, excellent food delivered to your table quickly, and really really great service. I recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very basic food and the portions are so small. Honestly don't understand why this place has so many stars... They didn't even have corned beef hash ready, but the server recommended it in the beginning. Honestly, really really great service. No doubt about it. Just the food isn't anything special and the portions are tiny. The roasted potatoes or seasoned potatoes are terribly bland and the hashbrown doesn't look homemade like the pictures I saw before coming here , but they comped my dish which I really didn't need them to. I just showed them a picture of the hashbrown and said that that was what brought me here."}
{"text":"Delicious food & amazing service with a very personable staff. Definitely a great breakfast place! Corned beef hash & banana nut french toast were awesome :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Huevos Rancheros were delish!! 3rd time this week and cant stop having it! Plus the FRESH  pineapple/watermelon juice was refreshing! A MUST GO & CHECK IT OUT!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate breakfast here and it was amazeballs. The food was great and the service was awesome. The ambiance was really chill and laid back, real nice to enjoy breakfast to. Music was on point"}
{"text":"Went here after our workout and got the protein omelette - delicious!  Would definitely have that again and the hash browns that came with it were seasoned well. They have a new AYCE option that if I was really hungry I would definitely try out. 

The reason I am giving it a 3 star rating is because we found a sizable piece of hard plastic in our food - it wasn't discovered until my boyfriend heated up the leftovers and took a bite at home.   Also, they are a cash only restaurant but do have an ATM -  however if you aren't prepared with cash then you end up paying for an ATM fee so good to know ahead of time."}
{"text":"Just had bite for the 2nd time and I'm truly convinced. The atmosphere is casual and the food is homey. I ordered the corned beef hash, and my husband ordered the Bites Benedict (made with chorizo and fresh Pico De Gallo), we got the Sweet Potato Pancakes for our daughter. All of this, combined with their freshly squeezed orange juice for us and ice cold milk for our daughter, made this spot a hit on our list. We will be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Always nice and friendly.  Baby friendly...  nice comfy family breakfast place!!!  Every t"}
{"text":"A very friendly place with a great vibe and even better food. Lots of great choices, from traditional to something different."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service but needs to improve consistent of food presentation to score 100%"}
{"text":"A spur of the moment breakfast decision, my friends and I were very impressed with this eatery! The restaurant is a little small but still fits a good amount of people. Luckily when we got there, seating was still available. It did pick up as the meal went, though, so I'm glad we got there when we did!

The menu offers a wide variety of food, and I wanted to try everything! I ultimately decided on the Gatsby burger, which had onion strings, bacon, lettuce, BBQ sauce, mayo, cheese, and a sunny side up egg served with a side of fries. Everything tastes delicious! I was quite impressed with how well the burger was cooked and how the flavors felt fresh. The burger was a bit messy with the sauce and egg running down the burger but I knew what I was getting in to!

The wait staff friendly and accommodating. I didn't feel like we had to wait long for assistance and they consistently replenished our drinks without us having to ask. 

All in all, a very wonderful experience and it's a restaurant I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Oh what a beautiful morning!  What a wonderful day!  Love when a new restaurant opens up and they have fast efficient staff and don't act all bewildered when they are busy.

Stopped in for a late breakfast with my mom and Cesar Q.  The restaurant was rather busy and there were only 2 waiters.  They did an excellent job and we never had to wait.  Our drinks were constantly filled, didn't have to ask!  That's a huge plus.  Our meals came out quickly and were nicely plated!

I really enjoyed what I ordered.  I had the chilaquilles with chicken and scrambled eggs.  Portions are huge!  You could sooooo split here.  My meal was in a word, awesome!  My mom had the tuna with a side salad.  She said it was ok just to many raw onions.  The hubs opted for the monte cristo and he loved it!  Served with warm maple syrup!  Sweet!

Location is great as it's just off the 215 at Flamingo.  Just go west on flamingo and take a turn into the Tagrget shopping center.  Plenty of open parking which makes for an easy in and out.  Will definitely be back to try some more of their yummy food"}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast!!! Awesome food that taste great and is very satisfying!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Their food is so delicious. Love their brisket scramble and funfetti pancakes! My bf loves their coffee. They have delicious fresh juice. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"1st time coming to bite and all I can say is wow!!! The food was so delicious! I had the country fried steak it was super juice and had some much flavor!!! The service was excellent!!! I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Went on Monday July 4th at around 10 a.m. for brunch. The place was not incredibly busy, there were some empty tables. My girlfriend and I waited over 15 minutes for somebody to take our drink orders. Once we ordered our food we waited over 40 minutes. I ordered Egg Florentine and my girlfriend ordered a skillet. They forgot my girlfriend's toast and it took her another 10 minutes to get it. The table next to us received there food after us and they said they had been there 20 minutes before us. I'm not sure if this place was just understaffed for the holiday but the service was horrible.

At one point I noticed there was a massive line at the front of at least 6 different groups. I counted the empty tables, and there were 6 totally clean empty tables. About 3 groups left because they were not seated.


I was disappointed by the way the place looked inside. It looks like a high school cafeteria inside, the tables and chairs look cheap. Not a huge deal but I had a different impression of the place reading reviews and passing by.

My food was okay. It wasn't good enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Delish pancakes! I tried the funfetti pancakes and they were to die for especially if you get it topped with yogurt! The hot maple syrup that comes with the pancakes adds such a sweet touch :)"}
{"text":"Worth to drive from Southern Highlands. 
Very attentive staff that stays on top of service. I will go out of my way to have the corned beef hash again. A bland interior but we can work around that."}
{"text":"I have nothin but good things to say about this place. From customer service to the food , everything was amazing"}
{"text":"Best chilaquiles I've had in a while. This place is amazing! The pancakes are delicious and fluffy. 
I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Cash only as of March 4th, 2018. Their explanation was because their Wi-Fi is slow. When pressed if they were planning on getting that fixed, the response was \"Uh, yeah.\" Not returning until I hear this has been resolved."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Bottomless Coffee
BEER CAKES - Guinness beer batter with crispy smoked Applewood bacon pieces
BITE'S ULTIMATE PANCAKES - Fresh egg surrounded by our buttermilk pancake batter filled with bacon and sausage pieces
MONTE CRISTO FRENCH TOAST - Turkey, ham fried egg & Swiss cheese
FUNFETTI PANCAKES - Cake batter with rainbow sprinkles and topped with yogurt (...or not, bro)
CHOCOLATE MOCHA WAFFLE - Whipped cream and chocolate fudge
MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKE - Minty green pancake batter, loaded with chocolate chips and topped with whipped cream and chocolate fudge
BANANA NUT FRENCH TOAST - Homemade banana nut bread dipped into our French toast egg batter, grilled and topped with sliced bananas

Replacing the shuttered Sun City Café, Bite quickly garnered attention when I discovered it was less than ten minutes from home and giving the restaurant a few weeks to get its footing before paying a visit with three friends the simple conclusion is that either they still haven't figured it out, or perhaps that they never will.

Located in a strip mall, pretty standard for Las Vegas, Bite is the invention of Chef Andrey Ariza and having personally contacted the restaurant weeks prior to find the website and menu (and subsequently linking it to their urbanspoon, yelp, and foursquare accounts) the first tip-off regarding customer service occurred when their online question form went unanswered and finding similarly disinterested staff located in store suffice it to say that those who drink their coffee quickly should sit close enough to the back of the restaurant to fill their own - the bottomless cup of $2.85 brew admittedly good, though the temperature could have stood to be turned up a few degrees.

Pleasantly decorated for Christmas, with a small kitchen and at least three line cooks manning the fryers and grills, it was with football in the background that an order was placed and requesting the food in two rounds the items rolled out at a good pace - the mistaken substitution of pancakes for French Toast one flaw, while the 'funfetti' stack was served without yogurt as though no one would notice - a later excuse of \"we just replaced it with butter, \"sorry 'bout that bro\" apparently felt to be service-recovery enough.

Speaking to the quality of the food, much like the rest of Bite it was a bit of a mixed bag, the first round of savories honestly proving superior to the second set of sweets with the Monte Cristo fairly well constructed despite being unfried while the \"Ultimate\" was interesting if only for the runny eggs at the center, though this also contributed to a substantial degree of sogginess when taking into account the somewhat greasy sausage, the Beer Cakes surprisingly my favorite plate with light hoppiness and a crispy griddled layer overlying a fluffy center that paired nicely with smoky bacon.

Transitioning to more childish delicacies after a bit of respite, and a couple of trips to the coffee machine as the restaurant began to fill, 09:10:11 on 12/13/14 arrived just after unordered banana pancakes and funfetti pancakes lacking the menu-promised yogurt arrived and returning the first while settling for flavors no different than average white bread in the other it was in the crispy chocolate waffle and a single $3 mint flapjack that we indulged, both decent but nothing to write home about, while the late arriving Banana Nut French Toast was admittedly quite good, a crispy topcoat overlying a pudding like center with plenty of bananas made all the better by a drizzle of warm maple syrup.

Stunningly unapologetic for serving items without the toppings promised on the menu and mostly underwhelming in their execution of plates that sound far more interesting than they taste one of my dining companions summed Bite up best when she said that it seemed they were trying to capitalize on the success of BabyStacks, but with four of them already populating a valley with plenty of competition from EggWorks, The Cracked Egg, Blueberry Hill, Hash House, and so many others that offer a better overall experience I'm not really sure Bite offers any good reason to go back."}
{"text":"Big fan!

I was visiting my folks and had to run a few errands when starvation hit me like Mack Truck! I pulled over and did a search for a good breakfast place near me. Bite Breakfast & Lunch came up as a good option and it had plenty of good reviews, so I found the mall it was in, but when I parked my car I almost missed them because at the time they were doing some construction in their main dining area and the place looked as if it was closed! Fortunately after walking back and forth a couple of times, I figured it out and got in. 

Folks, the service was excellent. I was greeted by a young man who ended up being my server and another young man who seemed to be manager on the day. They both were very pleasant, I quickly got a table and my coffee mug was filled with steaming coffee. I am not going to go into the details of the dining area because it will most likely be changed by the time you read this, but it was clean, quiet and well setup. The place was half full, so it was not as if I was the only one desiring a late breakfast! My order was taken quickly and shortly after my food was in front of me. 

I had my breakfast and it was done exactly the way I want it. My server and the manager checked on me (and others) a few times to make sure everything was alright. Altogether good food and great service. I will stop by there again for sure."}
{"text":"Cheerfully greeted right away, we grabbed some menus and a seat. After five minutes or so, the server took our drink orders. However, we had to wait 15+ (I stopped counting after fifteen) to put our breakfast order in. I saw our server cleaning tables, mind you nobody was waiting for a table, and taking other orders before ours. A small grievance, as the pancakes were delicious and more than made up for the service. 

A personal note, while I enjoy some sweets and Nutella, I would have preferred the Nutella drizzle on the side. The pancakes can definitely stand on their own. 

I'll have to agree with other reviewers: Bite should consider hiring another server."}
{"text":"Excellent service great food so tasty with a great atmosphere.will defiantly be back, the Monty Cristo was amazing as well as the stuffed steak"}
{"text":"I tried 3 dishes at Bite and didn't like any of them. Plus, the service, while friendly, was sort of off putting because they were very stringent about their rules in such a way that made them seem ridiculous. And, didn't make me want to come back. 

I tried the pancakes, a stuffed steak, and the monte cristo. All three were disappointing. The steak was oddly chewy and is basically a steak wrapped around some filling. The pancakes were tough, and the monte cristo was overly sweet."}
{"text":"So tasty! The fresh juices are amazing and the food does NOT disappoint. I had the garden omlett it was the best veggie omlett that I have ever had. The kiddos all enjoyed the fun-fetti pancakes and give them 54 thumbs up. The hubby had the crunch french toast and said it was fantastic! Must try!"}
{"text":"Still love this place but quality did change a bit from the time of my last visit. So many yummy yummy dishes here like the corned beef hash, funfetti pancakes, stuffed steak, chilaquiles, and so much more! Visited today for birthday brunch and got all the goods. However the chilaquiles were a little soggy, pancakes a little flat, and the hash too crunchy. If you order the chilaquiles make sure you really like spicy. The strawberry basil lemonade is always good but much smaller than my last trips. Presentation is still great but flavors left a little to be desired with past visits in mind. I'll never give up on Bite and it's still my favorite breakfast spot, but higher hopes for the next visit."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!! The coffee is great & the service is always amazing!! Carlos, andre, & bianca are the best!! They are always friendly & attentive. The food is delicious! I am so in love with the oatmeal & the wheat toast!!! If u r in the area (or not) u must come by!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem , don't understand why this place isn't packed with people .. great food , great service and prices are very easy on the wallet .."}
{"text":"The staff are very welcoming and accommodating w recommendations. The coffee was really good and the fresh juices look amazing!  I got the cinnamon apple pancakes that were so good w the warm maple syrup!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite new place for breakfast, everything was fantastic. Fresh squeezed juice tasted like eating a liquid orange, and the strawberry pancakes were the best, as was the country fried steak. Amazing service and fast! Will certainly be back."}
{"text":"If you have the opportunity to come here get the Bite's Benedict.  The Chipotle Hollandaise Sauce is genius especially with the pico de gallo and chorizo on top!!! If you love spicy this is the dish for you!!!  I tried my friend's Spanish Skillet which was also delicious with a hint of spice!  The owner who helped us was super nice too!!! Too bad I don't live in Vegas or I would be back!!!"}
{"text":"was a random breakfast stop but definitely worth it! the juices are fresh and the food was very delicious. would definitely be back whenever i make my way out to Vegas!"}
{"text":"So I came here for the first time last week, had the country fried steak and husband had the chilaquiles did not review but would have given four stars. Everything pretty good, gravy was really good with lots of bacon and sausage, the pico in the chilaquiles was a little rough (as far as knife skills) but the dish pretty good! Came back today, got the fried chicken with gravy and eggs and friend got biscuits and gravy, gravy was ok but hardly any meat in the gravy if any. Dishes were ok but not seasoned. Consistency is key, get what your expecting and what you've experienced before to be good, and season, don't be afraid to use salt, it enhances flavors. I will try the food here again, the customer service is excellent, just looking for that food to be executed a little better than all the rest, just a little extra care to make it good."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite casual place for breakfast! Best french toast ever. I always get the classic french toast combo and it always comes out perfect! The maple syrup is warm and there are always leftovers."}
{"text":"My husband wanted pancakes for breakfast and I found this restaurant on Yelp close to Red Rock Casino. We ordered their specialty, Bites Ultimate Pancake which is a fresh egg surrounded by their buttermilk pancakes filled with bacon and sausage bites and the Hazelnut Nutella Pancakes with slices of banana on top. Both were good and portions were huge and could be shared. My kids wanted more Nutella for their pancake and they were able to give us more, free of charge. Nice and clean atmosphere. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Can't rate this place as all the others because we never got our food.  WTH!!!!  When we entered, the other patrons had already been served.  Therefore you would think service would be quick.  Was seated before a party of 5 but their order was taken before ours, WTH?  A couple received their food before we did.  Matter of fact theirs was barely up under the heat lamps and they were served right away, WTH?  As we continued to wait the waitress and the owner continued to take orders of patrons who arrived after we did, WTH?  Then the waitress while passing our table asked us, \"were we ok\"?  We stated we were still waiting on our food.  She looked surprised and went to investigate.   She then brings us our food which had been waiting under the heat lamps for about 5 - 10 minutes before the other couple's order, WTH?  When we decided to leave the owner had the nerve to say, \"but it was under a heat lamp\",  WTH?  

From what I could tell we appeared to be the only people of color.  Things that make you go hummmm!! And may I say again, WTH?????  Hence the lone star because I couldn't go any lower."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is a hidden gem. From the moment you walk in to the minute u leave you'll be happy. The service is great the food is delicious. Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"OMG!   I've been wanting to come here for several months now.  I actually had no idea that it was hidden and tucked back in the plaza till a friend told me about it!  This place is so yummy.  The minute I walked in it was so immaculate and modern.  It was extremely welcoming.  I cannot express how good the service was and how amazing the food was.  I love that the owner came up to check on us and introduced himself.  I caught him doing it the other tables as well.  So awesome.  I love supporting mom-and-pop small Business shops.  Please come here!   Can't wait to come back.   :)"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for eggs Benedict and found this place on Trip Advisor. We traveled 7 miles from our resort to try it. It was more than worth it. I had the Bites Benedict made w chorizo and spicy hollandaise and my wife had banana nut pancakes. We both had sausage, hash browns, and apple bacon. Yum does not come close to describing it. The service was superb. Carlos was fabulous. If you're in Las Vegas, then this gem is a must find. My wife loved the bacon so much we ordered more to go! If you want a great start for your vacation, or you wanna end your vacation with a great breakfast before heading out, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"If you are living closer to red rock canyon, you must try this breakfast place. Loved the food and service. Would come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Food and service were great! I had one of their specials, the Cornbread Chicken and Waffles, and it was delicious! My favorite was was their Strawberry Basil Lemonade! Mm mm mm I'd come back and just order that to go when I can't stay to eat. It's very refreshing!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. pretty similar to most traditional breakfast places in vegas. The lighting was bad, very dark inside which felt weird while having breakfast. The food was good though and the fresh OJ was great! friendly service"}
{"text":"Bite was a very good. The food was very creative and tasty. I think they do a really good job on all that they make. We enjoyed it so much we went there twice in a 4 day weekend. I think they have a really good thing going with this restaurant. The food was very fresh and flavorful, very well done. The service was very good and the food came out very quickly. Something they do that I wish other places would learn from is the staff takes care of the customers. There are waiters and waitresses but they dont focus just on \"their\" tables. The whole staff takes care of the customer. The help wait on the tables, bring coffee, water and food. Very few places provide this good of service. I was very impressed as the waitress remembered us from our previous visit. She also remembered our drink order !"}
{"text":"Given that this place was highly rated, I was actually disappointed by the taste of the food. We ordered the special at the time, Cornbread Chicken Waffles. Unfortunately, the waffle didn't taste like cornbread, and the chicken was a little under seasoned. But the meat itself was tender. We also ordered the Hazelnut Pancakes. The pancakes didn't taste like hazelnuts, but there were just small pieces of hazelnuts in it. 

They also have fresh juices, so I tried the fresh pressed pineapple juice. It was a bit sour and a Lil too sweet. 

However, the service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Dare I say this place is better than cracked egg?!? 

The service is always great and the staff is always friendly. No one knows about this place yet, so I have never waited more than 5 minutes to be seated! 

The food is fabulous. I've had everything from the pancakes, to the waffles, to the biscuits and gravy. I highly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"Meh...I love you Las Vegas, but does anyone know what good food is anymore? Came here after the Grand Cafe fiasco. Prices are a tad high for boxed pancakes. I don't care what the menu says. I make from scratch pancakes and these are not it. Service was friendly and prompt. Thank you."}
{"text":"Good customer service! I went to bite this morning found out that there is chicken and waffle but they are out of it. The manager came up for no reason and apologize (im very chill and I did not complain but they approach me anyway) and gave me unlimited coffee."}
{"text":"My friends and I grabbed a BITE here before our morning hike and it was a delightful experience! We ordered the hazelnut pancakes, Corn Beef Hash, Monte Cristo and Bite Benedict with some freshly squeezed orange juice to gulp it all down (a definite must try!) Service was good and overall quality of the food was decent. I definitely recommend you to try this place out if you're looking for a cozy new breakfast/brunch spot if you're ever nearby the Flamingo and 215 area!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Bite.  Great reviews and hunger-fueling food photos.  Unfortunately, it fell short of our expectations.  We've only been there once, so perhaps we came on an off day. 

Here's what we ordered:
Chilaquiles w/ steak - $14
Unfortunately, the ranchero chips were completely soggy and chewy (which I hope wasn't by design).  Normally the crunch of the chips adds a nice texture to this dish.  The flavors were bland.  The steak was chopped up into tiny bite-size pieces that didn't look all that appetizing.  There just wasn't a lot of cohesion on the plate - it just felt thrown together.  I added a good amount of Chalula for some much needed flavor.  

Bite's Signature Stuffed Breakfast Steak - $15
It's an interesting idea that sounded tasty, but the rolled up piece of steak was a little overcooked and visually disappointed upon arrival to the table. The steak was seasoned well, which helped, but it was dry.  The flavors reminded me of a steak fajita with an egg.  The potatoes (I think they were the seasoned potatoes) were a little stale, as if they were originally frozen.  The idea to roll a steak with other breakfast ingredients just didn't work for us. 

Mint Chip Pancakes - $3.99 for a single 
Everything on this pancake worked well except that it was overcooked (borderline burnt) on the bottom.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with chocolate fudge, whipped cream on top of a fluffy pancake.  Had it been cooked properly, this would've been a delicious dessert pancake. 

French Press Coffee - $4
This coffee was great.  It was full-bodied and had great flavor.  Def. recommend.  

Cold-Pressed Apple Juice - MP
I don't know if the juice was cold-pressed or freshly squeezed, but it was good.  Not too sweet, just tasted really fresh and natural.  We were hoping to try the Apple/Lemon/Ginger combo, but they had run out.  

Service wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't great either.  Everyone was very friendly, which I appreciate, however, we got the sense that the servers didn't know the menu inside and out.  Several answers to our questions about ingredients started with \"I think it's...\" or \"Let me ask the kitchen..\" It was also tough to get an answer on the cost of the cold-pressed juice, since the menu just lists \"market price\" and the server didn't remember. 

Unfortunately, since all three dishes disappointed, we likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I love knowing that I'll be a satisfied customer every time I come to Bite. I love trying new dishes; today I got the build your own skillet. I got over easy eggs with bacon, ham, avocado, onion, bell peppers and cheddar cheese over a bed of delicious potatoes. It was super delicious and filling. We were seated immediately. Our drinks were taken as soon as we sat down, the fresh pressed orange juice and apple/ginger juices were satisfyingly crisp fresh. The customer service is exceptional- I wish more restaurants invested in the employees as much as this owner. Thank You Bite!!!"}
{"text":"Six of us went for Sunday brunch while looking for something new to add to our eatery list. We were quite happy with the selection, and ended up with a couple of wet burritos, an omelette, and a few of their Benedicts. 

The eggs and the sauces were perfectly done, and the chipotle hollandaise that I subbed on to my San Diego Benedict was absolutely perfectly spiced and creamy. 

The wet burritos were massive and very tasty, though I was of the opinion they had too many potatoes. We also tried some of the mimosas, and found them pleasantly light and refreshing and not syrupy sweet. 

Note: it's cash only.

Definitely a new go-to place."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new breakfast joint and found this place... a MUST go for anyone who has never been before!!!  5 star service... 5 star food... will absolutely be back!!  Their biscuits and gravy and banana nut french toast - bomb!"}
{"text":"Best corn beef in town. Stuffed breakfast steak is excellent. Staff is friendly. Environment is relaxing."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Everything is made fresh.  Large portions, good service and fair price.  My kids would give 6 stars if they could."}
{"text":"Very good buttermilk pancakes and eggs, lemon poppy seed (i think that was out others had) that they liked a lot, service was VERY good as the guys are really trying to do a good job at service."}
{"text":"We went here this morning for brunch. The service was very friendly, but the seating was a bit uncomfortable. I ordered the monte cristo benedict sandwich. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the ham and turkey were very fresh. I ordered fruit instead of potatoes and the fruit was actually worth the extra charge having lots of strawberries and pineapples. It came with maple syrup on the side and the french toast base was well cooked. The only problem was the hollandaise sauce. I'm not even sure if that was what it was supposed to be because it tasted a bit like a burned bechamel sauce. I don't know if maybe the chef was having a bad sauce day. I appreciate that they put it on the side instead of ruining the dish with it, but I think I would have just said they ran out of hollandaise. I also ordered an orange juice which was AMAZING. So fresh and sweet. My husband had a ham and cheese and spinach omelette. It came with hashbrowns. He liked everything. Overall it was a very nice brunch and we will probably go back again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time on Wednesday and I was very pleased. 
I had the Monte Cristo Benedict and my date ordered the corned beef hash.

The Beni was very tasty, I loved the sweet and savory mix to it. Eggs were poached nicely, although the I would've preferred them to be a tad bit more runny. The hollandaise that they had on the side had the perfect hint of tangy to complete and compliment the dish.

Corned beef hash was so flavorful, I loved it! It was on a bed of hash browns which were nicely cooked with a slight crisp to it. 

Love this place and I can't wait to try more dishes next time!"}
{"text":"I was glad to finally have the opportunity to try out this cool cafe'. I had been next door so for my daughter's birthday breakfast, she asked to go to Bite.

We arrived around 11ish and the place was super busy. We were acknowledged when came through the door but had to wait just a few minutes to be seated. First impression was simple, laid back decor. Nothing fancy but playing some awesome reggae tunes. The menu is interesting enough and I decided on the Huevos Rancheros to split with the hubby. Our server sold me on enjoying a fresh, mouth watering pineapple juice. My daughter had the apple juice. The juices are all freshly made and just phenomenal to drink. They are a little pricey but I don't mind paying when it's fresh. My daughter ordered the Funfetti Pancakes. Our service was good not great. The problem was there was only one server being supported by two bus people. Appears to be family owned so this may be the reason why only one server or somebody called off work. Anyway, our server could have used some help but he did hustle and made sure to check on every table.

The food arrived and did not disappoint. The Huevos Rancheros were hot, eggs tasted fresh, the chicken added extra flavor and the sauce was tasty. My daughter loved her pancakes, I tried them with a little hot syrup and they were overloaded sugar pancakes to me, not for me but fun on a birthday. Overall, we enjoyed our dining experience and planning to return to try more dishes and of course more Huevos Rancheros!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and friendly staff having fun at what they do made for a great vibe to enjoy an awesome brunch. The food was so good and there are so many options, will definitely return to try more!"}
{"text":"Super cozy and ecclectic spot. We got greeted right away upon arrival. The staff were all so friendly!
We ordered:

Corn beef hash- really good and different. Instesd of your normal beef hash and potatoes its kind of like a brisket and hash brown type of meal. so savory!

Huevos rancheros/sunny side up eggs- Soooo good! Perfectly cooke Eggs with red&green sauce beans 
and rice all on one plate= party in your mouth good.

For out sweet tooth we got:
Peanut butter banana french toast- simply mouth watering. We couldnt stop taking bites even afer our stomachs were about to pop from the amazing food.

This place is really worth trying. The staff is so friendly the food is amazing and the music playlist is on point. 100% coming back. Thanks bite!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I was drawn to it because of the name.  Up in the Grand Canyon and Flamingo shopping center, I found it relatively easy. Adorable frontage sign and nice space.  You can tell they aren't finished with the interior decorating, but it is clean and I cant wait to see finished product.  Service was run by two people who seemed to easily handle the steady stream of customers.  Ladies bathroom was sparkling and smelled beautiful.
The food was plentiful, hot and good.  Wasn't fond of the hash browns.
had some type of spice added.
Food was good and portion was plentiful.
I had the berry waffle which was delicious and my friend had the French toast which she said was good also.  Coffee was good and they have flavored creamers upon request.  If they continue the level of service and the quantity, presentation and quality of food, they will survive."}
{"text":"The customer service is amazing. The food is amazing. The fresh squeezed juices are amazing, oh and the chilaquiles are to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I checked out Bite last weekend for the first time. All I can say is this place does not disappoint. 

The day we went, they were having issues with their credit card machine,  so it was cash only, but I guess that's not normal for them. 

Anyway, having checked out their Yelp reviews before arriving, I knew I had to try some of their lemonade, so I got the watermelon mint. Holy moly it was amazing!! My boyfriend had the orange juice and I don't think I've had OJ so fresh and delicious since I lived in Florida. To eat, I had blueberry pancakes with bacon & eggs. Everything was perfect and delicious!! My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs, he said that it was the perfect steak. Not too thin, not too over cooked, not too tough. 

For the two of us, price was just short of $40, which is a bit pricey for breakfast but tbh... that juice was worth it. 

The service was really great. Everyone was so friendly and on top of things. 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and owner. This will be your new favorite place to enjoy breakfast in Las Vegas. Daily specials and WARM syrup served! This is breakfast to perfection"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and vibrant. The service is friendly and everything you want from a local breakfast/lunch spot.

I had the ultimate club with fries. It was delicious. If you a haven't been you need to come by and try Bite.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. My server was friends with the owner whom I also met. Such nice men! Food was good and I will be back."}
{"text":"*Military discount* 

Walked in on Saturday 6-11-16 at 9am and we had the place all to ourselves except for one other table that was wrapping up their meal.  We were sat at a table with a clean top but it had dirty seats.  I brushed the long black hair and scrambled eggs onto the floor and took a seat.  

$27.58 got us a breakfast wrap and a pancake combo.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  It was almost unbearable at times as I was tired of looking up and saying \"we're doing great, thanks\" after about the 9th time. 

Hubs got the $7 Moe's wrap which was a flour tortilla filled with egg whites, avocado, bacon and cheddar cheese.  It came with a salsa on the side and for $3 extra he added \"seasoned potatoes\" although they were completely devoid of any seasoning, not even salt.  At least they were hot and cooked all the way through.  

I got the peanut butter banana french toast and added eggs and bacon on the side.  The bacon was room temp. but that doesn't bother me.  The scrambled eggs were still really runny on the top which I hate.  The french toast was not soaked long enough and was just *barely* cooked.  I only made it a few bites in before I gave up.  I liked that the syrup was served warm.  

I'd say go here for their zany pancake flavors (funfetti, mint choco chip, etc.) or their fresh pressed juices. Service is cloyingly nice but food and ambiance does not deliver.  I left hungry and sad."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great! Loved the chocolate chip pancakes and eggs and bacon. Apple juice was yum, freshly made. Only suggestion more offers for kids. The juice was freshly made and great, was a little expensive though. Great service and will definetely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely recommend it! I came all the way from California to try it and ended up going both days I was in town. The owner, Andrey, is an awesome guy who took great care of us. Loved the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Service was great and people were friendly. But the food was just ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't delicious.  I had the San Diego Benedict, but it was a bit bland."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant today and we are glad we went.  The seating is simple and clean, the décor is fun with a nod to the name, light music played in the background, and three televisions were broadcasting a mix of sports and news.  With all this going on, you would think you would not be able to hear your dining companions, but there was no problem with noise.  The staff is excellent, they are professional and courteous, and take responsibility for the experience.  It actually felt as if the owner was serving us!  The food was delicious, we enjoyed the Chilaquiles, just enough spice and incredible flavor; and the Strawberry Nutella Crepes, sweet and yummy with whip cream and drizzled chocolate sauce. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great service. Mom dad & 3 kids were pleased. Good coffee, fresh juice, fantastic hot chocolate with a mound of whip cream. Perfect potatoes. Good quality bacon. Chocolate mint pancakes ( that sound gross to mom, kids thought they were fantastic). Fantastic beans and fresh tortillas.  Vegas off the strip is the way to eat!"}
{"text":"So good. Great food, great service, but ac was not in use. Had to enjoy an excellent meal sweatin. Must have not have been a problem cause I cleaned my plate. Only thing left on my plate was my sweat. Will come back."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me always. The owner is always so welcoming! One day I brought in my dominoes to play while me and my friend waited for our food and he said he was going to bring back his game shelf and sure enough next time I dined he brought his box of dominoes over so we can play! They always take great care of us and the food is homemade.. Love it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I took about 20 minutes trying to decide what to get because everything on the menu looks good.  I ended going with my standard eggs and bacon.  Best eggs I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Bite was suggested to us through the app on my iphone. It was absolutely wonderful. Place was clean, food was fresh, breakfast was hot, coffee was hot and delish. They also offer a unique menu. I loved being able to choose what went into my skillet breakfast, and their Monte Cristo breakfast sandwich was amazing. Service was great, pleasant and easy. I can't recommend this place enough. If you're in the area, you've got to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Chicken n waffles was very good. I wouldnt go with the poppy seed pancakes (just weren't as sweet). Overall loved this place"}
{"text":"We went with our nieces to have breakfast yesterday!  We loved it.  The atmosphere was so inviting, the employees were so welcoming and the food was fantastic!   We highly recommend the Bite to everyone!"}
{"text":"Ever weekend my best friend and I find a new place on yelp  to go for breakfast. This was the worst so far... We were sat as soon as we walked in and asked what we want to drink before we could look to see what selection they had..  That was the end of our service, we looked over the menu which looked great a lot to choose from!! Yum!! however 3 wait staff and a buser walked around us for 20 minutes not even looking in our direction.. During this time it seemed to be a meet and greet with friends coming in.. My friend and I got up to pay for our drinks the wait staff didn't even notice.. As we asked how much for the drinks the manager/owner (I'm guessing) asked however was?? Really  we looked at our dirty empty table and said we never got served, he offered to make us something on the fly. We thanked him and said no, he said no charge for the drinks and please come back again.... After looking at other reviews I'm going to have to say no.. The good reviews must be from friends.. Staff definitely needs to be retrained on customer service..
 We went across the street to Rise & Shine a Steak & Egg Place, the wait to be seated may take a lil bit but the SERVICE and food is on point!!"}
{"text":"Server(Carlos)  was very polite and friendly. After I order, the food arrived at an appropriate time. I had the Lemon Zest and poppy pancake and the chorizo Benedict which is called something else. The coffe was good and endless and I loved the creativity of the menu.  The food items I had were amazing. Spent $21 with the tip. I will plan to be back every time i hike Red Rock Canyon."}
{"text":"We went this morning with our 2 year old son. First, they are great for kids and will do any pancake (and probably lots of other dishes) in a kids' size. Second, funfetti pancakes are a thing, and my son loved them! 

I had the cinnamon raisin crunch French toast - delicious! Sweet enough that it didn't need the syrup. My husband had the apple cinnamon pancakes and enjoyed them as well. He also ordered  a bone in ham and said it \"had a nice char\" and was tasty (I don't eat ham, so can't comment one way or another).

Note: this isn't a gourmet breakfast place. It is simple and quick. The service was great and the food was yummy. Don't go here expecting something fancy. Just go for the yummy and know the whole family is welcome."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. The buffalo chicken wrap and BLT were only average and nothing special. The menu for breakfast looks much better but I wouldn't return here for their lunch items."}
{"text":"I had the French toast combo. Bacon was crispy and eggs were dead. French toast was a little burnt and it was baking HOT in the restaurant that my legs were sweating to chair. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Simple place with an island vibe, ordered a coffee and by far the tastiest coffee ive had at a breakfast place. I ordered the spanish omelette and my boyfriend got the green enchiladas, good service, good portions, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My new regular place. Family run vibe. Seems like everyone cares. Food is great. Girls are friendly and no nonsense and great looking.  Carlos is hip and cool and moves fast. with the best attitude in town. Pancakes and French Toast are always great but I appreciate the fact it's the only place in town that consistently pull off and egg-white omelet. Moist yet cooked, cheese melted perfectly, like five times in a row."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and I already want to come back. From the moment we walked in until we walked out, the customer service was remarkable. Frequent check-ins at our table and the warm maple syrup essentially rounded up this review to 5-stars.

I tried the Bite's Ultimate Pancake and \"yes\" it was ultimate. It comes served with four (or was it five) fluffy buttermilk pancakes and within the pancakes are a few over-medium eggs. Just that alone was good, but then they fill the pancakes with bits of bacon and sausage. My goodness. Not one thing wrong with this calorie monster. Must order.

We also tried their signature stuffed breakfast steak. You guessed it. Instead of the boring tortilla wrap, your wrap is wrapped with a steak (which by the way was cooked perfectly at medium). For the topping, we tried four cheeses. Other choices were egg and chorizo, egg and bacon, and some others. This unique breakfast dish worked so well. The four cheeses were adequately melted and surrounded by a juicy medium-cooked steak. I think you get the picture. Just try it.

Also ordered the Loco Moco and BLT sandwich. The BLT was standard fare, but the Loco Moco was interesting. It's served with a pork belly patty along with the usual mushroom gravy sauce and eggs. For me, it tasted a bit too fancy. I prefer the Loco Moco at Island Flavor. If you do however have a craving for Loco Moco and you happen to be here, it's a solid choice. I suppose it's Loco Moco, but elevated.

The coffee and the cold-pressed juice were both good. Coffee tasted fresh and the cold-pressed juice (although a bit pricey) helped put to ease all that crazy goodness we put in our bodies. 

Parking is a breeze as Bite is located in a large shopping plaza. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am not a big breakfast fan, is a matter of fact I could go the rest of my life without eating breakfast and be perfectly happy BUT for some strange reason at breakfast time I feel like I should eat breakfast!  It's strange, I know.  The first time I ate here, I came at lunch time (a meal time I love) and had a delicious salad!  My daughter ordered the strawberry pancakes.  Now, I haven't had a pancake in about 3 years but for some reason I was tempted to take a bite of hers.  Before she knew it, her pancake was gone!!!  OMG, it was amazing!!  So of course my first thought is \"Lea, you haven't had pancakes in 3 years so that's probably why it's so good\" so my second thought is now I have to try more pancakes...I did and they just weren't as good or even close to as good!  The strawberry pancakes here are AHHHHMAZING!!!  I've brought my husband now twice for breakfast (he is a man that can't go a day without breakfast) and he LOVES this place!!  This place has me enjoying breakfast a little bit more these days!!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the Bite after church ! Really good food and ABSOLUTELY fabulous staff - even picked up this Mother's coffee tab will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time back at this place since a year ago.. I remember the food being good but never returned cause I left the place smelling like fried food  .. The smell literally got stuck in my hair and clothes for the entire day! Anyways, we came back today cause my husband wanted to eat here and the food was horrible! My husband had the steak and eggs and the steak was super dry. My side of bacon was also super dry. I couldn't even cut it with my husband's steak knife. They were also out of a bunch of menu options. Truly disappointed that we spent $82 on three people for such a nasty breakfast. What a horrible way to start the day... But anyways on the plus side the restrooms were clean and the waiter was nice."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place a 4 is because the food is really excellent. If there was a 3.5 that's where I would stand for these reasons. I have been there twice now with my family members. Both times they were out of something. First time was OJ and I forgot what else and the other was steaks. The time with steaks we went on a Monday morning so I'm assuming they were out due to a busy weekend.... however, the staff is very very nice and respectful, the service is great until they get a little busy then it's not horrible but not the best. We have gotten 3 desperate items there witch all here amazing .. 1st the omelette with spinach and egg whites and sausage, Then the French toast sampler, the regular friends toast and the churro French toast (amazing)!!! For parents I am not sure if they have changing areas for little ones (we didn't use the restroom) .... bottom line .. the food is great but next time try and go in the middle of the week so their stock is back up and also. Go right when they open (we were the first ones there)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Las Vegas. To start the hospitality when you're here feels like home. They just started offering Mimosas and beer. Perfect addition to any breakfast. The beach day mimosa is my favorite. There's literally something here for everyone. From stuffed steaks to Drey's corned beef hash is like no other. If you're really hungry I suggest the french toast platter. Finish it off with a fresh handcrafted cappuccino. Haven't tried lunch yet but I'm sure it's just as amazing. Highly recommended. If you haven't been you're truly missing out."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and loved it. Great menu and better food. The service was also fantastic. A great new neighborhood spot for me."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Stopped by here on a whim for breakfast. Arrived just before a rush but still had great service. The food was amazing too. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here with our 2 year old daughter. No waiting to be seated on Sunday morning at 10 am. Got our drinks quickly. There was no kids menu, but they make any order \"kids size\". Once we got our order in it took a while for the food to come out - almost 40 minutes. Food was good, not great. We had to ask for coffee refills twice. Kitchen looked confused and many tables took a long time to get served or got the wrong order. Staff was friendly and energetic. A little disorganized. They are trying. A good stop if you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"imagine all the best foods you have ever ate in 1 place !! bite takes all those foods and makes them infinity times better .. on everything bite is a blessing to have . try their stuffed steak & chicken n waffle ( i have never tried a better chicken n waffle combo in my life !!) bomb.com  - thank you dre for the amazing experience see you edc weekend"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a good location! Lots of stores and options, upon arriving to this location I did not have a hard time finding it. We were quickly greeted and seated. Which is always a good sign for great service, the waiter was super friendly and attentive and knowledgeable. After reviewing the menu I saw a lot of things I wanted to try- which is alway a good sign, more reasons to make multiple trips. I ordered the funfetti Pancakes for my son and chilaquelles for me. My hubby ordered the stuff Steak!  All the food came out delicious although I ordered my son the pancakes, which he didn't mind sharing with me. Which was yummy  and if he loved it, especially the whip cream.  I might be ordering that next time just for me. 
I highly recommend this place the breakfast options are great, portion sizes are great and the quality is definitely worth the trip. The flavors are great and the staff are super friendly. Which makes this place worth a visit especially with the family."}
{"text":"Wow this place went downhill quick.  I was there today and the food was disgusting I can't believe this was the same place that I use to love my friend had the turkey sausage patties they were the two smallest patties I've ever seen I thought it was a joke.  Also he got 3 1/2 slices of bread as his toast.  Not even two pieces of bread?  I had steak and eggs the steak was like a leather and a side of fruit salad which they had sliced oranges in with the peal on? with strawberries and bananas?  My scrambled eggs tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes.  For $35 for breakfast for two and we both left hungry it's not good. The place was pretty busy which is good for them because I won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice little lunch place. The menu offers both breakfast and lunch and there are so many options. I couldn't decide what to get. Went with the Sunny Sandwich. Which included bacon, hash browns, and eggs on a Texas toast bread. The juice was very fresh! Next time think I'm going to try the confetti pancakes!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area running errands and wanted to take a break to eat breakfast. I actually wanted to try Rise & Shine, which recently opened up across the street, but unfortunately the wait was 45 minutes. Opened up the Yelp app, and saw that Bite had good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.

When we got there, they were pretty busy. But there were a few tables open, so we were seated right away. The first thing that one of the servers suggested to us was to try their freshly squeezed juices made daily. We both got OJ, which was pretty good. Nice change from the one that we usually buy at the grocery store. I ordered the Monte Cristo, which was a big mistake. The french toast was dry and a little too thick for my liking. Even after pouring a good amount of syrup on top, it still didn't taste good. I took three bites with the french toast, then I was over it. I pushed the toast to the side and was eating the ham and cheese by itself at that point. My husband ordered the Ultimate Pancake and said that it was good. 

Customer service was friendly and attentive. What I did notice is that the staff here isn't really assigned to certain tables. They walk around helping all guests in the restaurant. I think everyone that was working that morning each stopped by our table at some point. 

I am willing to give it another try in the future. Service was great and sometimes I just order the wrong dish. Three stars for now.....

Located in the spot that was previously occupied by Pasta Fresh, near Tropical Smoothie."}
{"text":"Delicious and enormous brunch! My friend and I stopped here after hiking in Red Rock Canyon and were thoroughly impressed. The menu has all sorts of Pancake options, French toast, Benedicts and Mexican-style dishes. We shared the Chicken and Waffle special and a funfetti pancake (normally the pancakes come in a stack of three that are 10 inches in diameter but they sold us just one). The servers were friendly and the fresh juices were refreshing on a hot day. The restaurant is in a strip mall and we probably wouldn't have known about it except for Yelp but I'm thrilled we stopped!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is AWESOME!! The service is outstanding! Food was great!! Only warning, they are cash only no CC."}
{"text":"I went in this morning. I didn't eat there. So I'm giving this review based off of the attempt to get food. I reviewed the menu on Yelp narrowed it down to either Drey's corn beef hash or the Short Rib Hash. I tried to call it in but they didn't answer. Then when I get there the two things I wanted to order aren't even on the menu. So that was my first and last trip. At least have an updated menu."}
{"text":"The bites Benedict is awesome.  Everything went well together.  The stuffed steaks are good too.  If i lived in Vegas, i would be eating lunch here all the time."}
{"text":"Me and my wife just finished having breakfast here. I'm honesty not impressed at all my wife had the eggs and hash which tasted like it came out of a box no flavor no seasonings it wasn't good. I ordered the French toasted with a side of fruit the bananas and apples and oranges were good the strawberries shouldn't have even been in the bowl they were barely even red. My French toast was alright the syrup came in a cool bottle, but that wasn't enough to make worth coming back. And lastly we had the kale juice drink which was bitter and over priced. 

It's sad to get such poor food when the reviews on Yelp state other wise.
Although the food wasn't good, the gentleman and our waitress were helpful in explaining the menu and helping us pick out a drink. It's not there fault that the food wasn't good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was so pleased! The pancakes were absolutely delicious and the turkey patty was sooo good! Homemade not frozen! And the staff was all so friendly and welcoming..definitely my new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"We arrived for breakfast on a Saturday around 10 (which is crowded for most breakfast places at that time). There was a good amount of people eating but we got sat right away. The atmosphere was bright and inviting! The freshly pressed juice is amazing! The apple juice is a must to get! The breakfast choices are a refreshing change from the average breakfast menu, but they still have classic breakfast choices to select. We have found a new breakfast place!!"}
{"text":"First time in, greeted and sat immediately.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  Took my order quickly, and the food came out quick.  Will definitely return in the near future.  Great job guys."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The lunch menu is limited. The breakfast menu is huge. We came for lunch. My husband ordered the club, which was a nice size sandwich with a good portion of fries. I ordered the spinach salad, which was really small. I left hungry. The price for each was the same. Either  the sandwich was a good value or the salad was a rip off. 
Service was very good. Decor a bit sparse.  Will come back and try the breakfast. That looks like their specialty."}
{"text":"I love the island music. The servers are very energetic and attentive to your needs. I like that they can separate the orders by seats. Food has always been amazing. The corned beef is made in house. It's not an option on the menu but you can order a single pancake rather than a whole stack. The single is perfect if you want to order a main dish and still have something sweet afterwards. There's a lot of seating so the wait was maybe 10 minutes at 11am on a Sunday. When I went at around 930 on a Friday there was no wait."}
{"text":"Got seated quickly. Service was great. Staff were very nice and attentive. Clean area, restroom was clean. Monte cristo sandwich was ok, I wish it had a little more flavor, my bf really liked his Belgian waffle though. Check out was speedy and easy. Menu had lots of options. I really wanted to try the stuffed steak but they ran out..."}
