{"text":"I got chicken salad.  I loved the salad. It was fresh, however it was lunch time and only 2 other customers were ahead of me, but it took over 20 minutes to get my salad.  They were extremely slow and didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I can't believe these reviews. Wings are awesome. Best in the area. People are always great to deal with and they have never gotten my order wrong"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken sandwich, lots of bun and very thin chicken.  They were also out of ice.  They are right in front of food lion. They should not be out of anything."}
{"text":"first and last time my family will ever eat there food was old and dry order was wrong . called back was told we order it wrong ? ask for two piece white got two piece dark with only one side instead of two I order and payed for. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME"}
{"text":"Not sure what was going on with then last owners of this place, but the menu says new management and it shows.  I've had the fried chicken twice and it's excellent. Much better than the king down the road (although they are very nice people as well)  if you went before are afraid of their low score go by and check them out again and leave them a score."}
{"text":"Chicken Bucket had a rough start and underwent an ownership change a few months ago. I have been there a few times. I do like their fried chicken better than the other fried chicken joint in town. There seems to be some secret ingredient in their breading. 
Restaurant business is hard and it's even harder for small independent places like Chicken Bucket. They need more staff at rush hours to reduce the wait time and make customers happy."}
{"text":"It's just not good, the chicken was not fresh- as in cooked that morning. It was greasy and over seasoned on top of being cold. The sides were blah at best. The mashed potatoes were the boxed flake kind, and the green beans were straight out of the can. 

I even tried the baklava hoping it would be good- but no such luck. 

I really wanted this to be amazing and it just wasn't. We threw away over half of our food."}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch.  I really wanted to like this restaurant, but it fell short in so many ways.  Let me start off by saying that the chicken really is good!  I had two thighs and they were cooked perfectly and tasted great.  But it went downhill from there.  My order came with two sides.  I am really picky on my macaroni and cheese and like to sample it first before I order it.  Sorry- giving out a sample was not permitted.  So I chose mashed potatoes and gravy.  The mashed potatoes tasted...AWFUL.   As another reviewer reported, they came straight out of a box!   I took two bites and left the rest.  The cole slaw was about half slaw, half mayonnaise.  It, too, tasted pretty bad.  The order came with a tasteless, store-bought pre-packaged roll.  Again, I was not impressed.  And they charge 35 cents for a Styrofoam cup of water.  I doubt if I will return."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance after we heard of the management change and am glad we did. I got the jumbo tenders meal and these tenders were fantastic - very lightly breaded huge pieces of chicken - I actually had to share! Mac and cheese was definitely improved and really cheesy. Cole slaw was quite good just the way I like them crunchy but not overly wet and a little zing to the dressing. The mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery. The drumstick was decent though has a certain spice I can't put my finger on and wasn't my favorite but it was better than our first visit. Kids left full and liked the chicke, fries and Mac n cheese better than Bojangles! Unlike my original review, we will be back and I'll have to try the chicken philly next time but may be tempted to just get those tenders again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a pleasant experience at Chicken Bucket.   The food and service was exceptional.  The place was very clean and prices were decent"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot on 04/26. I ordered a two piece snack meal and five buffalo wings sprinkled with lemon pepper. After I paid, I was told that there would be a ten minute wait. I was off of work and had nothing better to do, so I waited. The lady at the drive thru was extremely friendly as she checked in with me. Eventually, I was given a four piece snack (at no additional cost) and the wings. I only ate one piece of the snack meal lol. The chicken in the snack meal was delicious...well seasoned, crispy, fresh, and cooked to perfection! It was like bites of heaven! Unfortunately, the hot wings were a little less than average. The hot wings didn't have much flavor and were not cooked well. I'll be back, but not for the hot wings. Lol"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  No frills, good food, and great prices.   The coleslaw was awesome in my opinion!   The mac and cheese pretty good too.   Fish Sandwich was as good as any fish camp around.   Flush that down with a Cheerwine and you've got yourself a great meal."}
{"text":"So if this was just for the chicken I would give it 4 stars. I got the 4 piece chicken which comes with two sides. I got onion rings and green beans. The mac and cheese looked and tasted good. It is the creamy kind if you are curious. The sides were ok. Onion rings seemed a little over cooked. I would go back for the chicken."}
{"text":"The Chicken Bucket is a no frills, good food place with a very friendly staff. The girls at the counter are always very polite and acknowledge every person as they walk through the door. The cooks behind the counter are just as friendly and have always greeted me when I've entered the restaurant.

I'm always interested in the daily specials and have not had a bad meal yet. Thumbs up to the following menu items, Flounder, Fried Chicken, Chicken Wings and Beef Tips.  As far as sides go, I'm addicted to the French Fries Squash and Cole slaw. If you haven't had any of the above from the menu, I'd suggest any of them."}
