{"text":"Mediocre BBQ at best. Chain with commercially made sauces. For the real thing stop a few miles down the road in Marshville, NC at Rock House BBQ. Great pulled pork and natural homemade tomato, mustard and vinegar sauces."}
{"text":"we were on the road and had lunch at the Big Bob Gibson just outside of Monroe, NC.  we both had the chopped pork and it was excellent.  it was crispy and you got a lot of burnt ends.  you could eat it without the sauce but the sauce made it even better.  the other part was the two choices of coleslaws, the vinegar/sugar and the creamy.  the creamy was very good but the vinegar one was super with the pork.  we even bought a bottle of the sauce to take home."}
{"text":"Meh. on par with shanes, but not as cheap or fast. can't say I'd make the drive for a return visit."}
{"text":"There are three locations for Big Bob Gibson's: two in Decatur, Ala., and one in Monroe. As a Decatur native, I was PUMPED when I found out my favorite BBQ joint had an outlet in my new city. In the years since I left, I've dreamed about the pulled pork sandwiches and Brunswick stew.

Maybe I'm a little bit biased, but Big Bob's is the home of the best 'cue in Charlotte. (Actually, the world). Like most BBQ spots in North Alabama, pork is king at Big Bob's, where it's tender and juicy. But unlike so many places, the kitchen doesn't ignore the other meats commonly smoked. The chicken here is moist and full of smokey, peppery flavor and the ribs are pretty darn good, too. The chicken is served with a vinegary mayo-based white sauce and those in the know order it on the side of the pork, too.

The sides are all pretty good, too. The macaroni and cheese is standard, but the baked beans, potato salad, fries and vegetables are all top notch. And if you're really ready for an adventure, order the loaded potato -- a giant baked potato with all the fixin's plus a heaping pile of the barbecue of your choice."}
{"text":"Happened to stop at this restaurant on our way back from the Charlotte Airport thanks to yelp and glad we did, The ribs and barbq are excellent, the sides taste like normal sides nothing special the mac and cheese was tasteless, waitstaff was friendly however I was surprised she never asked if I wanted another beer but she kept the families sodas filled, I would def. recommend this restaurant and return to it. It was very clean and modern looking."}
{"text":"Drive through was a BIG mistake. Received horrible fries that appeared to have been cooked at least twice! Ordered around 7:00 pm. They were actually more cool than warm although they looked as if they were burned. I should have checked the order before driving off - too much of a hassle to return the order due to time contraints.  The barbecue sandwich was actually good, however, lesson learn with this order so I will not return! SHAME on serving drive through orders with bad food - there is no way they didn't know what they were doing!"}
{"text":"First time trying Big Bobs and we were looking forward to some good BBQ.  Our waitress then informed us that they had no pork,beef, or chicken because someone at the drive thru had a large order that wiped them out... Ok, well I decided to try the salmon at $14.00+ and my husband got the baby back ribs.  Unfortunately the salmon was dry and fishy-tasting and the ribs were very fatty.  At least the vegetables and slaw were good!  Also, the server was very nice and attentive.  Nevertheless, I believe we will not be back."}
{"text":"Pork plate and 2 sides $8.49 lunch before tax and tip.  Little overpriced in my opinion.  Meal just average at the absolute best.  Much much much better BBQ in NC."}
{"text":"Would give this place no stars but the chicken and white sauce is good. I ordered a drink no ice, got lots of ice. Order bbq beans got bbq beans but they had green peppers in them nasty! So I ask if I could get Mac and cheese instead and we got charged for it! Then they were like sorry next time you come in we will give you a free side... Yeah I am not coming back. They spent more time on this one lady then anyone else and to have 17+ people working at one time with barley anyone eating is bull! The rest of the food we got wasn't that great. So unless your a chicken fan and don't mind bad service by all means go eat."}
{"text":"They are only getting 1 star bc I had to choose a star. The food/ restaurant has gone downhill. Bad grade and they defentaly don't have the crowd like they used to. Last time we ate there the waitress not only messed up our order badly but there was hair in my food. Gross!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a barbecue fanatic, and this was the best pulled pork sandwich that I  have ever had! The bun was sweet and lightly buttered. The vinegar coleslaw was tangy with just the amount of sweetness. The meat was so light that I probably could have eaten two more!"}
{"text":"I discovered I'm not a fan of the white BBQ sauce, but the chicken was good not to dry. Ribs were very tender and pretty tasty. Beans and mac & cheese were so so. It was worth the $21."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews ummm are we talking about the same place? Or do some people do not understand what BBQ is well let me help. Low and slow smoke can be hot or cold. I read it had a 'little to much smoke\" if you do not want BBQ that taste like smoke then go to Taco Bell. I do not get it....
                 Maybe some have never cooked or eaten \"True\" BBQ because, there are very few places around that really do smoke it... Hint**** if you do not smell smoke then its not True BBQ another hint if you have 98% of your menu has NON BBQ items then your just a BBQ want a be your really a Diner well... maybe.
                  Just a quick class on BBQ if you do not see a \"smoke ring \" and it does not have some sort of smoke taste then maybe go for the Square fish?Or the mystery meat on a taco shell.
            This place has good Q"}
{"text":"I had the bbq 'regular' size platter here which came with two sides and a hush puppy.  The bbq was good quality and a tiny bit smokey...meh.  Living in the South makes you a bbq snob.  Hillbillie's pulled pork is definitely more smokey and flavorful.  The macaroni and cheese at Big Bob's was like Kraft shells and cheese - I can make this at home guys if I want to eat crap.  Try making it from scratch like Mac's and getting the crusty cheesy parts mixed in YUM.  The coleslaw was creamy and 'fine'.  The best part about the meal was the hush puppy.  Perfect amount of crispiness and flavor.  Dipping it in the bbq sauce was very good.  All for $9 bucks - not too bad.  I may pop in again to try the ribs which I guess they are known for."}
{"text":"Scratch another barbecue joint off my bookmarked list. 

I had a late lunch here today, @1:30 p.m. I had the run of the joint.

I ordered the, Thursday only, senior portion of pulled pork, potato salad, white coleslaw, and sweet tea. Price was @$8.50.

Pulled Pork? I enjoyed it, and that's all that really matters. The sauce that they provided tasted like Kraft BBQ sauce with a little added vinegar, a combination of east meets west NC BBQ sauce. It complimented the pork perfectly. The meat was tender and juicy. There was no smoke taste, but as I said before, it was fine. The portion size was perfect.

Potato Salad? Good stuff. Nice chunky pieces of potatoes in a creamy dressing - I liked it.

White coleslaw? I didn't care for this, because it was primarily crunch and no taste. I wouldn't order this item again.

Hush Puppies? In a word, delicious. They were large, round, crunchy, and non greasy - some of the best hush puppies that I've ever eaten.

Sweet tea? Nice. Sweet. Good stuff.

Service? Exceptional. I was offered a to go cup of iced tea, with extra lemon, which pleases me.

Price? Cheaper than I expected.

DÃ©cor? This is a really nice, clean, restaurant with leather, wood, and tasteful pictures.

Notes? 
The men's bathroom was very clean. 
I was impressed that there was a drive-thru.

Summary: Good BBQ and sides. I would gladly come here again. I was a little disappointed that I didn't get an opportunity to try their trademark white BBQ sauce, but maybe that only comes with their BBQ chicken. I won't lose any sleep over it."}
{"text":"Do not order the loaded BBQ stuffed potato from this restaurant.  When I got mine you could tell it had been sitting for a long time and that it had jut been warmed up.  Normally, a baked potato will be steaming and butter and sour cream will mix up real creamy.  Not this one. it was hard and it would not blend with the sour cream and butter.  I should have sent it back, but I did not.  The bbq (pork) was not great but eatable and there was not much of it.  Will not be going back there either."}
{"text":"I'm not a die hard BBQ guy so I don't really seek out BBQ very often.  This place is a consistent \"go-to\" place for me though.  The beef brisket is my favorite and they serve the majority of their pulled pork western style so more wet than dry and I prefer that.  They \"Big Bob\", have won several local BBQ awards and mostly for their ribs.  Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to try those ribs just yet, but I will!  They have typical southern sides, cole slaw, mac'n'cheese, and potato salad.  All are great!  

Service was not that great.  Waitress got the drink wrong, was a bit slow and seemed defunct in general.  

If I were Bob, I'd be big too, after eating here very often :)  That being said I think I still prefer the old school BBQ pit places over this newer location."}
{"text":"I have been to this bbq restaurant a few times now.  I'm from Texas bbq, but will not try to compare the two.  This area of the country is not known for brisket and so would not recommend getting it as it tastes like pot roast.  
I really like the dry rub on the ribs with the sauce on the side.  I love the chicken and turkey.  They once recommended mixing in some of their white sauce to shredded bird meat.  It was fabulous!
I love pecan pie.
I enjoy bbq baked potatoes.   I think is that much better with the bbq sauce mixed in.
I love the drive thru option.  I have always had very good service inside as well."}
{"text":"CLOSED FOR BUSINESS!
Drove by today for lunch and it was CLOSED.  Heard from the locals it shut down mid-Dec"}
{"text":"I love Big Bob Gibson BBQ !! The hush puppies are awesome.  If you have never visited Big Bob's be warned it is addictive ."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday, the 15th of June.

Heard .This was a good place and it did not disappoint.  I had the baby back rib small plate.  The meat fell of the ribs and was tender and tasty with the wet rib sauce.  My kids both got the pulled pork which was tenderly delicious.  My husband got the brisket which fell apart and was ate up quickly.  

No complaints.
Great, friendly hometown service with a smile.  Will return when out this way again."}
{"text":"A polished facade verision of on an old Decatur, AL favorite... the decor is nice for a Big Bob Gibson joint. The BBQ didn't disappoint in comparison, though. The smoke can find its way through the decor.

Very little business mid-afternoon, and a little bit of a wait for my ribs. However, the side salad was large and took a little extra time to finish.

If you like good 'Que, it is worth a try."}
