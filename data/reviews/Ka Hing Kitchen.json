{"text":"When I come to Pmall, I usually come to eat a thousand snacks.  However, when I'm really hungry and want an actual meal, Ka Hing Kitchen is my go to place.  I always get the same thing because I love duck.  At $6.50 for all this food, how can you complain?  It's not glamourous, but it gets the job done.  My belly is full and I get my duck fixing.  Asian BBQ duck is so fattening but so good lol.  I've been eating this since I was a child.  They do give you a LARGE amount of rice and not a good duck to rice ratio.  However, it IS still a good amount of duck meat.  Enough to satisfy me, that's for sure.  I always ask for extra sauce on my rice, because duh??  It makes the rice so much better.  They're good with this too.  I feel that they layer it between the rice, because the sauce is never just on the top.  Another good thing.  On my recent visit, my friends tried the BBQ chicken and pork on rice and they thought it was excellent.  They actually have cravings to go back and get it again.  Seating here can be tricky but turnaround times are fast.  We usually get lucky and find a seat right away."}
{"text":"Cheap prices and big portions, but taste is a hit or miss. I had the shrimp on rice with egg and there was no real flavour in it. However, for the price of the portion, can I really complain? It filled me up for sure. I just wish there was a little salt or something in there to make it better."}
{"text":"Was walking around the mall when my stomach started grumbling, so I headed upstairs.  Everyone who's visited Pacific Mall knows you'll be greeted by an assortment of different food spots, I took some time to walk around and see what was available and noticed this location had a lot of traffic.  They have the typical Chinese food dishes, I opted for the classic black pepper beef on rice.  Food was made to order and was fast and hot.  It took around 3-5 mins for my order to be ready.  Food was overall nice, rice and sauce was good with a decent amount of green peppers and onions.  One large chunk of beef was mostly tendon and was uneatable, over all tho it was food, I ate it, and I didn't die. I'll probably try another spot next time, but this place is decent. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Yummy, greasy Chinese food. If you're looking for novelty eats or healthy food - keep looking. Eat at Ka Hing because you've been perusing Pacific Mall for hours and you've sought sanctuary in the upstairs food court. You get the standard sized styrofoam take-out container full of any of the 100+ food options for $5.00-$7.00. I have been ordering beef brisket on steamed rice for as long as I can remember. The brisket is tender and the fat melts in your mouth. Comes with a complimentary soy milk drink, which is never enough fluids to match the amount of carbs and protein you get. Cash only. 3/5"}
{"text":"The man who took my order was nice and friendly and knows his stuff. I ordered Fried Noodle in Cantonese Style, which is basically Cantonese Chow Mein. The order came with complimentary tea, I wasn't sure what kind of tea it was nor did I like it nor finished it. I prefer soya milk which they used to serve complimentary. The noodles I got were decent, it wasn't as amazing and tasty as other Cantonese Chow Mein I had eaten. Although, it was still good and affordable. Might come back to try out there wide variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Up on the second floor of the Pacific Mall, this small counter restaurant is reputed to make some really good food for affordable prices.  It is the no frills of no frills.  When I got there it was late in the evening and about an hour or two from the mall closing.  It was the busiest of all of the counters in that section and price range.  The P.Mall is cramped at the best of times and it felt that way with even half the capacity in the area.  Now the food looks good and there were so many selections that it was difficult to choose.  I saw they had shrimp in lobster sauce over rice.  It is a simple dish but I had not had it in ages so I ordered it.    Not how my dad used to make it and it was a little on the salty side, which I can do without.  In spite of that, I am not ready to give up on this little cubby hole though.  I'll be back and hopefully they will give me reason to lift the review to something more respectable.  I'm hoping it was an 'off dish' for them and that it will not happen again.  Rating: Food 2/5 Service 3/5"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for dinner after a long drive from the States to Canada. Been wanting to try them because I've seen lines here in the past. Daughter ordered the Grouper with Bitter Melon On Rice and liked it. She thought the bitter melon was a bit bitter but I liked it, though! Hubs ordered the Stir Fried E-Fu Noodles and liked it. I always liked E-Fu noodles and this was no exception. I ordered the Hoi Nan Chicken on Rice and liked it, as well. I liked the sauce that was on top of the chicken. The rice and broccoli was a bit bland, though. Service was friendly but it took a while for the food to come out because the place was popular. There were a lot of people waiting for their orders. We thought that maybe they lost our orders but it came through, eventually. Will probably try this place when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Definitely not an accommodating place at all. When I first came to this restaurant, I asked them if they can substitute their meat in a fried noodle dish with tofu instead. I told them that I was willing to pay extra for this substitution and was willing to wait longer for them to prepare it. Keep in mind that this was late afternoon and there were maybe only 5 other people in total in the food court, most of whom were already eating their meals and the worker was just lounging around.   He then told me that he could not substitute any meal with tofu instead of meat. First of all, tofu is cheaper than meat and I was willing to pay extra for it. Second of all, the restaurant that I went to next, RIGHT BESIDE this place, Casa Formosa, not only gladly substituted the meat for tofu for any of their dishes, but also let me choose what kind of tofu I wanted.   I'm extremely disappointed since I know many Chinese vegetarians in the area who have converted due to their religion. I will point out that they do have 2 vegetarian dishes, however, having only 2 makes it get boring real quickly and it's not like adding tofu to the pan instead of meat is hard. Terrible, terrible service."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm near Pacific mall always gravitate to this small but surprisingly good take out place.  The price is right, portion size is good as well as the taste isn't too bad.  Definitely on my top five Chinese take out places in Scarborough.  Everyone has a different opinion of what's \"good food\"  I highly recommend giving it a try if you are in the area looking for something cheap quick and tasty"}
