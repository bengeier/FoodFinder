{"text":"Do not leave your homes to go to this restaurant! The place is nice but the food isn't worth."}
{"text":"Fresh made linguine pasta with bottarga. Was ok, just truly, ok. Very garlic-y.  But was a very nice place for a date.  SUPER friendly wait staff!"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening! The food was fabulous, the service was great! May I suggest the 4lb steak special?"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by my food. My romaine salad was dull and the pasta with eggplant lacked depth of flavor. Everything was under-seasoned and bland. Bread was an extra charge which always seems chintzy to me. Not a steak eater so this isn't going to be my place. Expensive for the food sampled."}
{"text":"Talia is a great addition to downtown Pittsburgh's culinary scene. I stopped in for lunch yesterday and I was surprised at their selection of menu items. The Italiano pizza was great, more than enough for one and spicy! The drink menu looked really good with lots of different Italian amaros/digestifs. I'm looking forward to trying more of what Talia has to offer!"}
{"text":"Struggled whether 3 or 4 stars, ideally would have given a 3.5.  Not bad, not great.  Very nice interior design and friendly staff.  I started with the $8 Italian salad which was adequate, nothing memorable but fresh.  The entree was a 1/2 order of pink peppercorn linguini for $10.  Not bad, not great...just ok flavor.  If you'd like bread to go with your salad or pasta, it'll cost you $5 and is basically an oversized brick oven roll.  Wine of choice was chianti Classico at $16....pricey.  All in all not bad, but nothing memorable.  I was in the city for work and will likely try someplace different next trip.  There has to be better Italian in this city at a better value."}
{"text":"Came here 3 or 4 times while attending a conference at the Omni Hotel, and ate/drank at the bar each time. The food was fabulous, as were the drinks. There was a new bartender at the time--on the younger side, wish I could remember his name--who made excellent drinks and was very welcoming to my colleagues and me. I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars because I didn't experience table service. But the bar experience was wonderful. I'll definitely return the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend visiting from out of town and we both really enjoyed our meals.  If I was rating simply on the staff and service, I'd give it a 5.  We had an awesome waitress who was helpful in deciding which meal to order and also some of the highlights in the city to check out after we finished!  I went with the lasagna special and ate every last bit. We also shared the cheese board as an appetizer and really how can you go wrong with cheese?  Went for the flourless chocolate cake, which was scrumptious, but I may be biased that my Dad has the better version!"}
{"text":"Staying in the area and stopped by fairly late after walking around downtown Pittsburgh. I was flying solo so opted to eat at the bar, which is beautiful and has great ambience.  The gentleman working the bar was engaging and service was great.   I opted for the lasagna special, which was very good.  The lasagna, topped with meat sauce, had well-balanced flavors and was served elegantly with crusty garlic bread and a nice salad. The portion was huge.   I was in the mood for some whiskey and found their selection limited but carefully thought out.  Started with a nice pour of Laphroaig 10 before dinner and then Angels Envy bourbon with dinner. The bar had some unusual whisky glasses, maybe the Glencairn Canadian snifters, that really enhanced the enjoyment of both whiskies.    Definitely would return.  Cannot comment on how service is when the main seating area is busy."}
{"text":"This is for the newly established brunch service only!  Pros:  -$15 dollar bottomless mimosas. Please do not change or remove this as you continue your brunch service like most restaurants in Pittsburgh seem to do!  -I also caught a sneak peek of the personal bloody mary fixings that you bring to the table.. WOW -Service was pleasant and attentive, both the hostess and our server were great. -Flavors were good in the pasta I ordered, definitely felt homemade.   Cons: -Portion size was disappointing for the price point.  -The menu was limited, but I'm sure it will expand/change as they continue brunch service.  Overall, not my first choice for brunch, but a decent spot to check out."}
{"text":"Gonna have to go middle of the road on stars. It is a pricey establishment to say the least. Didn't have time to try the food, but the beer prices are high. Looking at the menu, the food follows suit with prices. Posted and update menu. Bartender said they have been open 7 months or so and on their third menu I might go back and try the food just to do a better review"}
{"text":"Although food is above average, the service at lunchtime is terrible. Both times we got stuck with the guy who tries to impress diners by not writing down their orders. Both times this personality(less) individual forgot an item or messed up our order. He appeared offended when I asked him where my soup was after our lunch arrived and proceeded TO NEVER STOP BACK AND CHECK ON US. Never once asked how our lunch was!? Two tries is enough for us, there are so many other great establishments that place more of an emphasis on customer service to deal with this nonsense."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at the Hotel Monaco across the street, and heard very good things about Talia. We made a reservation for 6:00 PM dinner and were not disappointed with the food, service or atmosphere. When we arrived there were several empty tables, but by 7:00, the place was packed. We started with the margherita pizza as an appetizer. It was a little on the salty side, but we liked that and found it to be delicious. He had the Kale/Arugula salad with balsamic instead of Caesar dressing and I had the Romaine salad with beets and olives, both were very good. For dinner I had the 40 day dry aged rib eye and it was AMAZING. He had the Ricotta gnocchi, and said it was the best he's ever had. That's saying something because he's Italian and his family makes the stuff from scratch! The server was very attentive, even though he was busy. He took time to answer any questions that we had, and if he didn't know the answer the found someone who did. I would definitely recommend Talia as a date night or to celebrate a special occasion, and if my hubby and I are ever downtown again, we'll probably head back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant sits in the vicinity of Hotel Monaco and the William Penn, a great spot. The excellent service started from the moment we walked through the door. Here's how it all went down...  This place has a cool bar to the left of the reception area. Walking to our table, I noticed the open kitchen which I loved. There was hanging pasta and a carved pig leg on display.  The menu provided options ranging from grilled wings and flatbreads to octopus, homemade pastas and impressively dressed rotisserie meats. The menu made it hard to make a final decision but we chose the grilled lemon parm wings, half portion gnocci and the porchetta.   Wings- They were lightly seasoned but full of lemony flavor with a sprinkling of good aged parm. They had the perfect amount of char from the grille and the only thing needed was a small pinch of salt...darn near perfect.   Gnocci- These may be the most delicate morsels of gnocci I ever tasted. The sauce was so fresh with chunky tomatoes and a large portion of brisket added in. Perfezionare!  Porchetta- Pork loin seasoned with herbs and rubbed down with good oil just spinning all sexy in a rotisserie oven. There's fat dripping off of it causing the edges of the meat to become slightly glazed producing a savory sweet concoction.  Once finished, the meat is sliced and laid on a garlic slathered toasted ciabatta half and dressed with creamed kale and caramelized onion.   This was love at first bite across the table. Yes, it was just THAT good!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in Pittsburgh. I come here 2-3 times a week, and I'm never disappointed. The service here is phenomenal. They have some of the best bartenders in the area. Scott is the man.   The staff here is professional, pleasant, and welcoming. They will go out of their way to make accommodations for patrons.   Atmosphere is also great. Modern, elegant, and clean. They have a solid happy hour. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant - gorgeous bar area, dining and kitchen - really loved the atmosphere.  It is really a nice addition to downtown.    The food was delicious too.  Service was super - our server was very friendly and gave us all the info we needed on the Italian dishes.  The manager walked around to make sure everything was good which I appreciate.    We went on it's first official opening night and things ran very smoothly. Nice selection of food - and loved the variety of sizes too so if you weren't too hungry you could get a half portion.    We started off with the meat and cheese platter - a nice mix of 3 varieties of each.  The mustard that came on the platter - wow - spicy and delicious! I opted for a half portion of the ricotta gnocchi with braised short ribs in a tomato chili like sauce.  It was all I could do not to lick my bowl clean -fluffy and flavorful with just the right amount of heat in there - so good.    Hubby got the leg of lamb that was prepared on the fancy spit you can see in the kitchen.  It was so tender they have to serve it without the bone because it falls off after it's cooked. He really enjoyed it.    After dinner we went to the beautiful bar and had a drink. It was a great time-can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I was leery about trying Talia after reading the reviews on Yelp. I'm glad I gave it a chance. I dropped in by myself after work downtown. It was early and a week night so the restaurant was not crowded. The service and food were good. I would definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"This is Pittsburgh's worst new restaurant- I could pick this place apart all day... All you need to know is that the server put our checks in her mouth while she was putting her hair in a ponytail"}
{"text":"A friend who works near Talia first told me about the place; he hadn't tried it yet, but he mentioned a delicious, hearty smell when he walked by, and the bar looked beautiful. He wasn't wrong. We agreed to meet up for lunch and try it out. I arrived before he did, and immediately gravitated toward the bar. It looks elegant, and it definitely is the focal point in the restaurant. I looked over drinks and settled on the Violet Angelo. As soon as my pal arrived, he went with the Italian Racing Green. Totally worth mentioning: The majority of Talia's drinks tend toward savory, not sweet. Although my violet hued cocktail was fruity, it was not entirely sweet. Very subtle sweet flavor. The Italian Racing Green was all savory... purely herbal. Now, usually when grabbing food at a new place with a friend, we'll both order something different and let each other try our dish. Here we broke the rule; both of us went for the Ricotta Gnocchi with Short Rib after very little deliberation. I'd seen pictures, and it looked and sounded sooo good. We were both very pleased. The sauce was flavorful, the short rib was strewn generously over the gnocchi. The only complaint from both of us was the scarce amount of the delicious, fluffy gnocchi. Lastly, we decided to split a dessert. He chose the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Marscapone. I'm not big on chocolate cake, so it wouldn't have been my choice, but that being said, it was pretty good. The candied berries were plenty, the marscapone was not. I asked about the base, suspecting it was almond flour. I was right. I'd know that crumbly yet dense texture anywhere.  All in all, pretty good! I'd go again, but next time I'll need to try the Italian wines!"}
{"text":"Lamb shank was really good, but the reason the restaurant got 5 stars was Jennifer F our waitress. Yes, she was that good. She pulled a 4 up to a 5. Because the really good is still not awesome and it takes awesome to get a 5 from me. So service fast friendly, super knowledgeable. She steered me to both an excellent dinner selection but a new wine choice as well. Not fancy but solid. I'd say more more on the $$ than the $$$ range.The lamb shank was actually at the high end of the menu $30. My husband and I would both go back."}
{"text":"The bartenders and wait staff are very accommodating and offer up suggestions if asked. They make an effort to get your name and address you personally throughout your stay. The food is absolutely delicious. I got the porchetta with carmelized onions, corn cob, and creamed kale. I never imagine creamed kale would be so delicious but theirs was amazing. The flourless chocolate cake was to die for. I will go back often."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12  Excellent bartenders. Very attentive and they sample the drinks to make sure they are good.  Very good food.  Awesome wings. Good pasta.   Reasonably priced and nice atmosphere.   Questionable service.  Forgot to bring one of our friends food.  Took him 10 minutes to bring it to the table. We also had to wait a very long time for the check although there was hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was so good from the coffee to the meal to the service! Definitely a good decision!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience the porchetta house special was terrible. Out of five people no one had a positive comment on their meal at all the check was a little higher than expected but not of seen for downtown."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lively downtown atmosphere; the small plates including house-made smoked mozzarella, olives with sausage, and prosciutto; and the duck confit. The smart, attentive service contributed to an overall winning dinner experience. The wide-ranging menu had something for everyone in our group - from my keto preferences to my daughter's pizza preference. I recommend Talia for a delicious, easygoing, rich Italian meal."}
{"text":"Oh dear. This new place has tons of good intentions: lovely hosts and servers who enthusiastically explain how they are presenting \"authentic Italian street food\" and that you should feel like you've \"walked down a small alley in Tuscany\" (note: Tuscany is a region of almost 4 million people, not a small town). The menu includes an extensive list of amari (after-dinner cordials, including many that are hard to find in the US), a good selection of Italian wines, and some really appetizing-looking dishes.  The problem is all in the execution. Basically, everything - the food, the decoration, even the presentation - feels like someone went to Italy for a week's vacation, made a quick note of everything they liked, and tried to replicate it at home without any further research or training. Some of the appetizers were very good, like the salumi plate or the whipped lard with truffle; but there were also missteps, like serving the aforementioned lard with a dense, strongly flavored, seeded bread that would be more at home on a German or Danish table than an Italian one. The mains were even more problematic. The porchetta, announced as the house specialty, was basically a pork roast wrapped in a ring of fat. The outside of a porchetta should be crispy and crunchy - and scored, to loosen the fibers of the meat - and should be cooked so that the fat renders into the meat inside. In Talia's version, the pork skin and belly on the outside are rubbery, fatty and inedible - something to be removed and discarded before eating the insides. Also, porchetta should be thinly sliced and is usually served on a bun (this is, after all, street food, even at $26 a pop). This version was a big thick slab, closer to a massive pork chop - which again made it rubbery and hard to eat.  The worst culprit, though, was the \"pizza.\" I've traveled from the Alps to Sicily, and never once had pizza that looked like this. The crust seemed to be made of phyllo or some kind of savory cardboard. The sauce was caked on, and the cheese was greasy and rubbery - all sure signs that the oven is not hot enough for pizza. Even my kids wouldn't touch it...  I'm genuinely sorry that this review comes off as snarky. I admit to being an Italian purist, and maybe my expectations would have been different if this place hadn't been so loud about its \"authenticity.\" My suggestion: hire a real Italian for a month as a consultant, and have him/her put your house in order. Have them correct the spelling on the menu and teach the waitstaff how to pronounce the names of dishes. At $120+tip for an underwhelming dinner, I don't plan on going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"I struggled to decide whether to give Talia 3 or 4 stars. If I could, I'd give it 3.5. I stumbled across the restaurant on my way to an event. I got the event location wrong, so instead of self correcting, I decided to have a drink. The restaurant is roomy with tufted leather booth seats and the bar is pretty spacious. I cozied up to the bar and ordered a drink. The bar staff were attentive and helpful and I really enjoyed the drink I ordered which was called Moon over the Morn.   I looked over the menu for something light. I was feeling peckish, but not famished. I decided to go with the roasted wings based on the bartender's reco. I'm a big fan of wings so I felt good about my choice until they came out. They were big whole wings, like really big, as if they were injected with growth hormones. I like my wings to look brown and well cooked. These were pale as if they were blanched and quickly pan-roasted. I cut one of them with my knife and it was still a little pink inside. I sent it back.  They were accommodating and asked if I wanted to change my order but since I wasn't super hungry, I passed on the offer.  I really dig the bar and the staff is really nice. It's a fairly new restaurant so it wasn't super crowded. Seems like it gets the corporate after work crowd. I'd give it another shot minus the wings!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.   We were excited to try this restaurant. We thought it would be a welcome addition to the foodie scene downtown Pittsburgh. Sadly, we were wrong.  The hostess was very nice and we were seated in a very comfortable booth. The Pinot Grigio was delicious. Their gin martini was on point. That was pretty much the only good thing that happened.   Appetizers: one of their special was a stuffed artichoke. The intention must have  been  to only serve the filling. They must have fried the artichoke to the point where it was inedible. We had one of their pizzas. It's not really a pizza. It's more of a flatbread with crispy dough. Not bad. But nothing to rave about. The beef tartare was plated over some tomato sauce that totally overpowered the plate. That's all you could really taste. It didn't even come with any crostinis or anything to pair it with.   Now the entrees: I ordered the leg of lamb. I am a lamb person. This was by far the most chewy inedible piece of lamb I've ever been served. It was awful. Amongst the other entrees: the duck was over cooked and served with farro that was way too salty it made it inedible. The porchetta had way too much unrendered fat. The prime rib was good.   Service: it is obvious that there is a wide range of knowledge between the waiters. Our waiter seemed not to be knowledgeable beyond reading a list of specials off a small piece of paper. The other waiter working the nearby tables was making recommendations and seemed on point. To add to the misery, the entrees appeared while we were still finishing appetizers. The manager was very nice. He tried his best to remedy a terrible situation. Free dessert and dessert wine.   In summary, for a new joint in the current market downtown Pittsburgh this place misses the mark by many miles. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm underwhelmed. The restaurant is beautiful and is in a great location. I ordered a cheese board which did not meet expectations. The staff wasn't great. The food was okay."}
{"text":"The theme here is rustic Italian, with rich pastas and roasted meats -- plus pizzas and panini for lighter appetites and budgets. The food is rich and robust, the pasta fresh and cooked correctly, and the service is terrific. The beverage program is a highlight: lots of interesting choices of wine by the glass, creative craft cocktails, and a big selection of amari (Italian digestifs). The one weak spot here is dessert - few choices and no plate of biscotti or cookies to go with your amari. Doesn't look like they have sprung for a pastry chef here. Otherwise, a gem downtown."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. Definitely recommend the bread, mozzarella and prosciutto. Desserts were heavenly. Entrees were the perfect size. Sides were bigger than expected and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like eating rolls of fat. Don't fill up on bread cause they serve a whole red potato as a side. Just save your money and swing thru the Boston Market drive thru. I rate this place as BUTT"}
{"text":"We dined here because it was literally across the street from our hotel.  The food was delicious; I had gnocchi with a glass of Montepulciano, and some bread. The atmosphere was pleasant, and not excessively loud.  Cons:   (a) prices: $23 for a plate of pasta. FOUR DOLLARS for bread (outrageous; this should be complimentary). (b) service: not great; a little too aloof, and little eye contact. Water was not re-filled once in two hours. (c) dessert, a ricotta cheesecake, was bland & disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm strictly talking about the bar in this review- the drinks are amazing!  This place has become our go to happy hour joint. The bartender is not only good looking but his drinks are insane! They were consistent and I would know....I drank so many! The drinks are creative too- be sure to try the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Things to like: the cocktails are good, the pastas are yummy, the roasted olives are the perfect bar snack, and the service is friendly and helpful. Why I won't go back: it's INSANELY loud, the atmosphere is akin to an upgraded Denny's, and the entrees were really average. My husband's $40 steak was just ok. I apparently got the porchetta on an off night - it was dry as deli meat left out in the sun and I did not find a speck of pork belly in my serving, it was all overcooked tenderloin and my guess is it was sliced thin in advance and left under a heat lamp - another reviewers comment about dripping with pork fat couldn't have been further from my experience. The servers couldn't have been nicer about and took it off the check and offered to bring me another entree but after picking through the mess on my plate I was done. If you want a scene with good cocktails and pasta, it may be for you!"}
{"text":"At the onset the menu sounded great, when our orders came we were served with a smile from the very kind waitress, and the tasting began.  The plates seemed too small to house the severely crusty bread sandwich smeared with oil and pesto.  It was very difficult to bite the sandwich it was so crusty, so I tried to cut it, that did not go very well.  I ordered the rib eye ($14.00) it was very fatty.  I asked to speak to the manager as I could see she was making her way around, but did not come toward us.  I would have ordered a different sandwich at that time.  After some time, she came over and I expressed these minor concerns, she explained how they cut the meat from the roast, and sometimes it has fat to preserve the flavor, ok?  Then I noted they piped in Jimi Hendrix music on the speakers, at lunchtime, people were talking very loudly to converse at their tables.  We paid and left.  I was discounted $3.50 on my lunch tab, but not told by the manager, I did send a thank you from me via the waitress.  I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  really good IPAs,  very generic salads and pizza. Across the street from Omni and other Conference Center hotels."}
{"text":"I just had my first meal at Talia's and for the most part, it was very enjoyable!  We made reservations for 11:30, walked in and the place was empty. However, around 12pm it fills up pretty quickly! Our waiter was helpful as far as suggestions for the menu, but we didn't see him again until we were all finished. This didn't bother me too much being that we didn't have any issues with our plates, but a check-in is always nice!  The meals are served on a stone-like plate, which I liked because you avoid the scratching with your forks and knives, but they were heavy! The portions were decent in my opinion - I got the pork meatballs over polenta and I was comfortably filled after finishing it. Someone I was with ordered the flatbread and it's a 4 cut pizza, and she ended up taking a slice home. The other two people that were with me had mentioned that the gnocchi dish (w/ San Marzano/Calabrian chili/Brisket) did have a little spice to it, as well as the minestrone soup.  The waiter mentioned that all the food and condiments are house-made, and you can definitely taste it! Overall, the food and the atmosphere are wonderful and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch. Have to say the interior is very nice and the drinks are very exciting. We both read reviews and got the gnocchi. Which is very good. The sauce was so good. Kind of wished that it came with some bread to scoop it all up. The gnocchi was really good. They were bigger than normal but not that many in there. We also had the chocolate flourlesscake. More like a brownie but still nice. The only thing that was 10 bucks and really not worth that piece. But the quality out ways the quenity. Overall definitely come back and try different dishes."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan! I love the ambiance and decor. We made reservations for the 4 of us on a Thursday night for 6:15 on open table. The host was so cool and nice.   Looking over the drink menu, noticed they had negroni on tap, which was pretty cool. We had that and an Aperol spritz. Both really good.  We started with their daily bread appetizer and their grilled cabbage. Both so good...the olive oil for the bread was very very good! We also had their house mozzarella, which was great too..really liked the tomatoes on there. The white balsamic was a change, which I enjoyed. We split the carbonara pasta and the porchetta dinner. Our boys split the gnocchi, but had spaghetti pasta instead of then gnocchi. That was really good with the brisket in the red sauce... But, the carbonara is to die for!!! It was SO creamy! I LOVED it! The porchetta was ok to me... my husband really enjoyed it, but it's not something I normally eat. It is something they are known for because of the \"rotisserie\", so I wanted to try it. Other than that, everything else was great!   Our server was awesome...very helpful and on top of everything. The whole vibe and staff are really nice. Would love to come back for dinner when back in town."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, and the food was amazing! We went at 6 pm on Thursday, afraid it would be too loud, but it just right. We had the scallops (cooked perfectly), meatballs, and mozzarella salad. All were delicious - we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit on the pricey side. It's food was fairly decent, although I had higher expectations from the price. Their smokey margarita was not as fruity as they had described it to  me, it was more of a smoked BBQ aftertaste which I was not a fan of. They good variety however not too many vegetarian options, which was hard for my boyfriend to find something on the menu worth eating. We ordered a cheese plate as an appetizer which was delicious,  however, they could have given a bit more cheese. The pasta we ordered was fair, but nothing memorable for me. All in all, good place to try Italian food, but probably wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"A first-timer, I was wowed tonight. I sat at the chef's counter and got to meet both the chef and owner. I can't believe only 15 diners have written reviews.  Get with it!  I had Beef Carpaccio, Pile Rigate and Cannelini Bean. Amazing flavor, presentation and value. I loved my Hendricks and Tonics for $8.  Cheers! Ask for Jayla, my server, who rocked."}
{"text":"Pretty decent experience at Talia, we liked it but didn't fall in love. Made reservations for NYE, arrived a few minutes late but the dining room was pretty empty.   We decided to be festive and start out with prosecco which is on tap and chilled to perfection. Quickly ordered the our daily bread to munch on since we were starving. The bread is not to be missed! It's fresh and crunchy and is served with oil, butter, and mascarpone. I ordered the kale salad to start and my boyfriend did the daily soup which was phenomenal. The kale salad was just okay.  For our main course we decided on pastas; the gnocchi for me and the spaghetti for him. We actually ended up switching entrees but still had tons of leftovers. The portions are pretty darn big! The spaghetti was overhyped, and honestly had very minimal flavor despite the winter truffles. Probably would have gone for something else, but the menu was very limited for NYE. The gnocchi was fabulous though; it came in a red sauce with tender brisket.   For dessert we just wanted a sweet bite each, so we decided on the gelato which comes with a splash of espresso on top. It was pretty good, but quite small which was fine for us but definitely not really meant to share."}
{"text":"This lovely corner spot with its big windows, open and airy comfortable design and open kitchen is a welcome addition to Pittsburgh's downtown dining scene. With a rotisserie, pizza oven and varied menu that specializes in meats every bit as much as pasta, it's anything but a typical Italian restaurant. The pasta dishes seem rustic in nature and like almost everything else on the menu, the restaurant has clearly made it a goal to offer some menu items or twists on items that you don't find elsewhere in the city. It also offers some interesting cocktails and a nice, interesting selection of wines by the glass, that again seem to be attempting to offer items that diners won't find elsewhere in Pittsburgh. A few minor, yet very odd flaws kept it from scoring a perfect five star rating. While our server was both efficient and incredibly efficient, her mention of dessert and description of dessert items as we were in the middle of eating our entrees was a definite \"first' for me. The Cheese Board is advertised on the menu as \"a selection of imported cheeses\" but according to the person who delivered them and introduced the three cheeses, all of which were of good portion, they definitely weren't all imported. Truth be told, I'd prefer local cheese, the presentation was lovely and the cheeses delicious, but I'd also prefer that the menu isn't misleading. The third and final flaw worth mentioning was the Primavara Salad. Consisting of dandelions, watercress, avocado, asparagus and grapefruit vinaigrette, it should have been amazing, but it screamed for a dressing with a little more flavor and zip to bring life to it. Hopefully, the wrinkles will get ironed out and Talia will become a staple in downtown dining."}
{"text":"Wine selection is on point and so far I've tried the pasta and pizza. Both were incredible. The owner really took his time explaining the menu and wine which was wonderful also. I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had great experiences both times. I live in the building it is in, so with it being convenient as well, it doesn't get any better. The first time I came for a drink & light dinner. I got a rum & coke ($6) and marghertia pizza ($12) one day after work. Very satisfying. I sat at the bar & the bartender was great. The next time I came was for Sunday brunch. I got a peach Bellini (they have unlimited bellinis or mimosas for $15, but I just wanted one) and the fettuccini. Really good. The serving was small, but it was very filling. Very cute place with great drinks & good food. If I had a critique, it would be to have a separate price for people who only want one brunch drink. $15 for 1 Bellini is kinda ridiculous."}
{"text":"Had the fettuccine bolognese - very good. Wife had the evening special - lamb shank which was really good. Great Italian wine selection and the price is closer to $$ than $&$ - they have a couple entrees that are barely $$$. Wife's lamb shank special was 30."}
{"text":"The wait staff and food were amazing!! We decided to go out to dinner last minute and went to Talia without a reservation. The manager greeted us as if we were regulars; he was was so pleasant and on top of that, he also offered us free prosecco.   The wait staff was excellent, very knowledgeable and personable and not uptight like most restaurants downtown. They were really easy to talk to and knew the menu top to bottom. We even asked them detailed questions on sides and seasonings in each dish.  Food was out of this world. The flavors that came out of each dish were so surprising. We had the rotisserie porchetta and the gnocchi -- both of which we highly recommend. I also recommend sitting at the chef's table if available -- Chef Steve answered questions throughout our meal and it was awesome to watch him cook! Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Okay, I just left a porka-palooza meal at Talia Cucina and I think that I just completely clogged my arteries with pork fat!  I had to wipe pork grease from lips and make sure that no further evidence of porkiness existed on my face!  Just to clarify, I just came back from lunch at Talia Cucina with my usual lunch buddies and partners in food crime and we were originally going to order different sandwiches, pasta and pizza.  However, that didn't happen because we all decided that we would order the Spiedo \"Porchetta\" (Here, rotisserie roasted pork loin wrapped in pork belly with various herbs and spices) which was served with roasted red potatoes and a fresh herb salad.  We also ordered duck hash with polenta and a bread board which came with a spiced lardo (cured pork fatback with seasonings) spread.  Do you detect a pork theme here?  Honestly, everything was delicious.  The duck hash had pieces of duck, various vegetables, grated cheese and a tomato sauce on top of a bed of polenta.  I don't really care for tomato sauces, but this was delicioso!  Bella, molto bella!  The house made bread with spiced lardo spread was DIVINE!  And the porchetta was ridiculous!  My only complaint and I mean only complaint, was that some of the pork belly fat hadn't rendered or cooked enough so I had a couple of tough bites.  But considering that I received a humongous portion, that is nothing to really complain about at all.  My lunch buddies and I have decided that we are going to eat our way through the menu, so be on the look-out for an updated review.  One more thing, the ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice.  Somewhat intimate and not what I expected.  Sleek, rusticity?  And our service was excellent!  I can't wait to go back and waddle from my meal.  Word of caution, they don't take reservations for lunch, so go early!"}
{"text":"After work a few of my friends and I decided to walk down to Talia to check out their specials. I am new to the downtown happy hour scene, just because I just started working downtown a few months ago. We heard some good things, looked at some good pictures, and then decided to mosey on down.   The happy hour specials are only in the bar area. So be prepared before you go there. You can get their full menu at the bar and there is a lot of sitting around the bar and a few high top tables near the bar that are included in the bar area. It does fill up, but if you get there early enough usually there are seats aplenty.  The bartender was super nice and suggested one of their Moscato's for me. I usually like a red wine but this Moscato was just what I needed for a summer day. And I am so happy with the selection because the Moscato hit the spot. It was a bubbly Moscato that tasted like orange blossoms. When he first suggested it I was like, well let's just try it. But honestly I was incredibly happy and it did taste so much like oranges and so refreshing that I got a second glass.  They're happy hour is half off glasses of wine. There may be more but I was only concerned with the wine. I kind of want to go back and try their food just because I had such a great time talking to the bartender and drinking my Moscato.  I look forward to coming here again, since it is just around the corner from work. And I would suggest that everyone goes in sits at the bar and tries they're half off glasses of wine. And remember the Moscato is a personal favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch.  Service was fast and good. The Manager stopped by to talk and see how everything was.  Nice atmosphere.  Basically one large room with a bar off to the side.  Had the Ricotta Gnocchi that has short rib and calabrian chili.  Very tasty with some spice.  Really a good stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Service was poor.  Seems they can't handle when the restaurant is crowded.  The food was just average."}
{"text":"Walked in by chance and really enjoyed this place. We sat at the chef's bar and we were treated to samples of the porchetta and steak tartare. Both were divine. We shared the Italian salad and had the pizza Italiano and the sardines special. Everything was excellent, beautifully served and with wonderful flavors. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend. When we arrived, there was one booth available around 8 pm and that is where the hostess sat us. Everyone was nice enough but the service was very slow and the food took a long time despite it clearing out rather quickly after we sat down. We shared the wings, olives, pizza, steak, and gnocchi. While nothing was particularly bad, we were not particularly impressed by anything either. Definitely in no rush to return, but might consider in a few months. On a side note, music was random and I felt it did not fit with ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is great too...oh my gosh I am pleasantly surprised at my rotisserie chicken sandwich and the service was great.... our servers name was Mark and he did a great job... the drinks are pretty reasonable and we are very very happy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and we each ordered a pizza. They were exceptional; we'll be back again for dinner"}
{"text":"Incredible service! Damian took such good care of us. One of the best waiters we've had in a long time. Cocktails were good and food was amazing! Definitely will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and we were seated right away. Couldn't be more convenient to the event we were going to at Hotel Monaco. The meat & cheese charcuterie boards were decent. On par with others we've had short of Europe. Our waitress recommended a great red wine for two of us to share and it did not disappoint. I was the only one to order the tuna and it was decent. A little overdone, however not charred and it was warm inside. If I rated solely on what I ate I would've given 4 stars. However, the 3 other people I dined with all ordered the ribeye which came over a red sauce (?) and all three of them were disappointed. I've never known my husband to not like a steak that was done to his preference (medium) and he didn't even finish it. Given that all three of them didn't like it, I wouldn't recommend anyone order the steak, especially not at $41/plate. Good atmosphere, decent starters and wine list, but disappointing preparation of the main entrees."}
{"text":"The reviews on Yelp seem to be hit or miss - mine was a miss. The price point was unreasonable for the underwhelming food quality. We started with the margherita flatbread. Nothing really special, but I guess I can't complain too much when it comes to pizza. My main entree was the portabella sandwich, one of the two available vegetarian options. Aside from being pretty bland, it is very awkward to eat with whole roasted vegetables stacked between a (stale) ciabatta roll. The dessert made up for some of the disappointment. I definitely recommend the affogato which comes with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and an espresso shot poured over. So good!  Although the food was lacking, service quality was incredible. Everyone from the host to all the wait staff were extremely friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place was here, used to come to this spot when it was the lobby of the Alcoa building for the coffee shop. Would never know it, they did an amazing job building this space!   Cheese plate is stellar, nice bite to the cheeses and the daily bread and butters were outstanding.   We had the fettuccine and the spaghetti. A lot of places are overwhelming with garlic but here you taste the cheese and the peppercorns. Just so satisfying.   Service was friendly and attentive. Great atmosphere. Will definitely be back to try lasagna nights on Thursdays."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant walking by on my way to the Double Tree Hotel. It is located in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. Beautifully decorated the restaurant has high ceilings, hardwood floors, leather seats and a ton of rustic charm.  The menu is limited and pricey. I wanted to order the ribeye steak but it was a huge cut at $41...OUCH! I then wanted to the lamb chop appetizer at $16 for only 2 chops. The chops were braised so couldn't be cooked medium rare. I finally settled on the wild boar chops with sweet potatoes. It was good but I'd rather of had a small size of the ribeye. The restaurant should offer two sizes of the ribeye.  I savored two glasses of full bodied red wine that complimented my meal. There is a flourless chocolate cake that I didn't safe room for but sounds delicious!   Service is good and not too stuffy. The hostess was friendly and multi tasked helping servers the entire evening."}
{"text":"Was just walking by and this looked like a cool Place...food is yummy.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really good dining experience. The highlight was the US-made Tamworth prosciutto that Talia uses: it's almost as good as the Spanish acorn-fed Jason Iberico De Bellotta   - well done US!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and gave a great people watching perspective from the bar. Had the meatballs which were HUGE and the Brussels Sprouts. Those Brussels sprouts were amazing. I was craving them the next day. Bartenders were super attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"For a girls' Saturday night out, my friend and I decided to try Talia because we had heard tge food was pretty good. It started out pretty good-- we were seated right away; the hostess even got me a new menu because the one she originally grabbed was smudged with a little grease; we got our water....and then we sat. And sat. We weren't even given a drink menu upon being seated. We tried to get the waiter's attention but that didn't work. We even tried to get the hostess' attention to no avail. Three other couples sat after us, and were promptly greeted by the waiter, given the rundown of the night's specials, and drink orders were taken. Still we sat. About 20 minutes had passed before anyone had even acknowledged our presence--other than the young man who brought us water. By this time, we had lost our appetite for any food this place had to offer. We gathered our things and headed for the door. When the hostess saw us, all she said was \"Leaving?\" And when we explained what happened (that we had been sitting there for a long time without service, while others seated after us were already served drinks), the hostess simply replied \"Oh, that's too bad.\" !!!! No \"I apologize, let me get someone right over to your table,\" nor \"Let me get the manager to speak with you.\" Nothing! I have no idea how the food tastes because we didn't even have the opportunity to have a drink. They won't have to worry about me walking through their doors again."}
