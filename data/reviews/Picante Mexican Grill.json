{"text":"This place never disappoints. By far the best Tex-Mex in town. Quick service with friendly staff. The difference is in the food, all-natural no added crap that most of the chains have. Homemade guacamole is amazing. Best hot sauce around!  I will never go to Qudoba or Chipotle ever again. It just doesn't taste as good and I prefer to support a local company. If you haven't tried them you're missing out."}
{"text":"Working on the Westside of town, I was excited about the addition of another lunch  venue, besides the burgers and old school Italian. Imagine my disappointment when I walked into this joint that looked like a copycat of Chipolte and wished that my chicken burrito was Chipolte. Everything about my meal was bland and flavorless. Ironically, Picante has no spice. I guess it's back to burgers and Italian."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. When I first started coming here they were struggling but now that they are established they rock. The music. The staff. The patio. Love it."}
{"text":"Like a better version of Chipotle's or Moe's. Similar but - locally owned/operated (better service), better ingredients, cheaper, more creative, good beer selection!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. Also great value for what you spend. The Tuesday five dollars special is my favorite."}
{"text":"Good spot if you work around here, decent prices and good food. Nothing extraordinary but a good option for some quick burrito bowls! Owners are hard working and nice people and usually right there working on the spot at peak hours."}
{"text":"I actually like the food here however I was very disappointed with the UberEats order that I just received from Picante. I specifically asked for each sauce (guac, queso, salsas) to be served on the side ONLY. However, every single sauce was in the burrito bowl mixed together. Almost inedible for me. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place since it opened. Very good food to go along with customer service. If you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite while in the Uptown area be sure to stop in and check this place out."}
{"text":"Use to love this place, but it's become horrible. Just had to toss out my burrito because it was so horrible. Tasted bitter and was runny. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else says, it's similar to Chipotle.  I like Chipotle better though.  It was very quick to get our food, eat and head back to work.  I had lunch over 2 hours ago and still smell like the restaurant so I'm not a fan of that aspect.  It was decent for my first time coming here but I'm not sure I will be become a regular."}
{"text":"This place is great!

I ate here when I was visiting friends and loved it! Such a friendly atmosphere. The workers even checked on us to see if we liked our food--something not very typical of quick in-and-out type places.

I had 2 chicken tacos and thought they were so tasty. If you're in the area, you should stop there for a quick and affordable Mexican meal!"}
{"text":"Just your average burrito place.  Really no different from Moes, Chipotle, or Qdoba.  Though, having this place closer than any other burrito place, I will probably go here more often.

It is nice that they have more choices: Multiple burrito wraps, types of rice, meats, etc.  In general, a little more variety.

Service was good, food was good.  I'll return."}
{"text":"Hiding next to the Burger Company is a little place called Picante.  We ventured in one day to check it out and have been back three times since.  Obviously we like it because we've been back.  Simple menu with solid choices and good quality food.  For the most bang for your buck go with the three soft tacos and load them up with all the fixings.  They have chicken, fish, steak and ground beef and lots of veggies.  The Guacamole is good but an order of chips and a coke will put you over $10 so a took a star off for being a tad pricey.  They should have a deal where you can get chips and a drink for around $7.99 with your tacos.  One point, they have $2.00 Sam Adams bottles seemingly everyday and also on the weekends they have $1 tacos.  Great little place."}
{"text":"Was in there on March 4th around 3:00 pm. Was \"greeted\" with an eyeroll by a very unhappy woman behind the counter. I said \"hi, how are you\" and she replied with   \"(Insert grunt here)\". When I ordered I got
More sighs and eyerolls.  My salads were tossed down by the cash register where a nicer man (manager?) cashed me out. I will say this it was my first and LAST time there. TIP: there is a Chipolte 3 miles
Away on south Blvd."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bit since it's so close to my house. Identical to Chipotle.  Bowl was really good and similarly priced. Staff was super nice. Not a fan of the Buffalo chicken but they have regular flavor as well. So not busy for a Saturday afternoon which is a little shocking, could be the parking confusion. I think you are supposed to park at The Burger Company.  I'd give it 5 starts except for the chicken, I think they should just drop the additional flavor. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided I wanted to try this place I bookmarked since it's near my job.

I walk in and the line is long but moving fast.

I decided I wanted a fish salad. Came with a free drink.

I moved down the line picking items for my salad. Paid. The end. No smiles, no interaction, just stares to imply the question of toppings I wanted.

Drink selection was very limited. I was going to get water but it's connected to fruit punch. The person that was ahead of me got water and it was pink from the fruit punch. None for me. 

I may go back to try something else. Flavors were mild and something made my salad very watery. Not appealing at all. I like they had fish as an option, but its not better than something I would have bought a Chipolte."}
{"text":"Really, really, really great! Every single aspect of the meal is better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Picante is basically Chipotle without the higher end ingredients, but it's good, and there are a lot of deals usually during the week. I know for sure that they have $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and some other ones that I can't think of now.  I've had both burritos and tacos and they're just like Chipotle, but not quite as good IMHO. I think they just don't taste quite as fresh, which may be a function of the fact that it never seems too busy in here so the ingredients might be sitting out for longer.  I'll keep swinging in here when I'm hungry and need a quick meal."}
{"text":"Reluctantly, I admit that chipotle is better...

It's local, which is a nice.  But, I wouldn't if I were you......

Go to Sabor a few miles away, instead."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place for a impromptu girls night out and was very pleased!!!

Total VIP treatment, since we were the only customers. The staff was very helpful and hilarious! This place is very similar up Salsarita's, Moe's and of course my personal favorite Chipotle. 

It either bowl, burrito, tacos or salad with your choice of meat and toppings. Tons of meat options here: beef, chicken, steak, veggie ad even fish! 

I got the special which was the Philly Cheesesteak...WHAT?!? Yes please! It came loaded with queso and steak over rice (white or brown) and I added lettuce, cheese, corn salsa, and sour cream (no extra charge for sour cream here!) And bonus alert....on Thursdays you get a drink for free! Whoo Hooo! 

The bowl was absolutely delicious! Very tender steak...loved the queso and just the creative combination of flavors. It was all very fresh and tasty! Add chips for $1 and you have a great meal. It's definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Chipotle (strictly burrito bowl) fan and found Picante to be pleasantly similar.

The portions and options are almost identical and it's great knowing you are supporting local business.

Here's the break down: 

A toasted tortilla at the bottom of your burrito bowl at Picante will set you back an extra 50 cents. Chipotle will not. -1

Picante offers more chicken flavor selections (herb and buffalo). +1

Chipotle's guacamole is chunkier and more flavorful. +1

Picante has $5.00 burritos or burrito bowls on Tuesdays. Tip: Go during off hours to avoid lines. +50

I'm summary, so what? I save the money and carbs for not adding guacamole and a tortilla to my order and don't have to take the trek down south blvd to the nearest Chipotle.

Bravo, Picante!"}
{"text":"Staff is great. The restaurant is clean, yet the food is missing something in comparison to Chipotle. Location is awesome (across from Wells Fargo)!

My boyfriend loves this place(only one like it that offers buffalo chicken), but despite multiple attempts I never finish it. 

Normally I love the bowl, yet I've tried the burrito too. I want to love this place. 

Favorite item is chips and cheese dip. They've never let me down there."}
{"text":"Today was a good day!!! The steak here is grilled with amazing flavors. There have been a few bumps in the road with staff during past visits, but the food never disappoints. Today, I got the Steak Quesadilla with Pintos and cheese. It was awesome. The staff issues seem to be worked out (thank you to the owners) and we will be back.  I'm a concierge in a luxury high rise. I can be extremely discriminating about the businesses I send my residents to, but Picante is officially on the list. #greatfoodcharlotte #deliciouslunch #bestcharlotteburrito"}
{"text":"Picante just opened this week and it's a welcome addition to the Westside. When the craving for a burrito hits uptown residents no longer have to haul over to Southend or Dilworth.

The menu is basic with burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and salads your main options. El niños get the option of quesadillas so chalk another advantage to being wee besides not having to file taxes.

Ordering is like you're used to, pick your form, protein and toppings. Is this place better than Phat Burrito? No, but it just opened and there are some flourishes here to distinguish itself. Spinach is one of the tortilla choices, the rice is seasoned similar to Qdoba's but with more subtlety, carnitas is one of the proteins and there are 2 seasonings to choose from for chicken. Another bonus: the availability of Mexican Coke! No Lindsay Lohan, I mean the made-with-real-sugar hecho-en-mexico 12 ounce bottles.

Grab your coke or bottled beer and grab a spot on the patio, I'm sure it'll be popular with a great view of uptown including Panthers Stadium. Parking is around the corner & shared with The Burger Co. There's bike lanes on 3rd St (cut through Wesley Heights to get here) or Morehead and covered bicycle racks in the parking lot too, so how about saving the planet when you get your munch on?

Hours are lunch to late dinner so consider a stop if it's Tuesday and you're still scared from your last stop into a Moe's on Kids Eat Free Day."}
{"text":"On my homebound commute, fortunately kind on the wallet. Full on flavor, a locally owned Chipotle/Qdoba kind of place. Support local entrepreneurs who offer lots of daily specials. Easy parking next to the burger place. And for the health conscious, black beans and brow rice are always available."}
{"text":"My friend suggested this after a hike. And I must say it was amazing. Special today was chicken queso bowl. Was amazing. There seasoned herb chicken was on point. Definitely gotta come back and try the other flavors."}
{"text":"Great food, but why are all the employees always rude as hell? And they were out of sour cream and black beans!"}
{"text":"This is a two part review.

Food: 5/5
This is by far my favorite place to pick up a quick burrito bowl. I love the flavor of the food and the portion are unmatched. My favorite time to go is during the lunch hour when the food is freshest. The food can be a little old if you go during during time. 

Service: 2/5
I love going when the owners are there as they are extremely nice to the customers and have the place running like a well oiled machine. During dinner it is a different story. My most recent visit (7/29) makes want to take a long a break from giving this place any business. The two women working could not have been more annoyed to be there. I ordered a chicken bowl, as it was the special. The woman making my bowl could not have been less enthused to be helping me and hardly uttered an audible word while I told her what to put on my bowl. I can get passed the slight attitude when the job is done right, but it wasn't. She rang me up and did not discount the meal for the  special. I asked her about it her attitude turned up a notch. She reimbursed me with cash after I paid with a card.  She handed me the cash silently with a puss on her face.  She didn't say a word, and I wasn't sure what to do with the money. I started putting it in my wallet and hen she asked me to repay her for the bowl at the discounted price. After this was taken care of we realized there were no straws for the drinks. Asking her to restock those was a travesty. She slunked from behind the counter to pull out more straws from under the counter and restocked them.  So much attitude just to fulfill her responsibilities of her job. 

I cannot recommend anyone enter this place unless it's during lunch when the owners are around. Puts a very sour taste in my mouth when a customer is treated poorly, especially when it is brought on by the laziness and inattention to job duties by the employee."}
{"text":"Ok so when his place first opened i was not  feeling it. It reminded me of a chipotle knock off and he food was lackluster. So i didn't go for a while. But I'm very happy i have it another chance. The food is great and fresh! As a nacho expert, this place definitely has some of the best in town.

Now i been here a couple times and enjoyed their buffalo chicken nachos, but i have to talk about the most recent. 
I went in on a Friday afternoon, the place was empty and we were waiting on one of the employees to finish making a uber eats order( good to know they do that here!)
Another employee comes up to help, never got his name but he was an older guy, or at least older than any of the other employees. 
Let me tell you,he made the most beautiful nachos ever!!! Now with a line and if i was in a hurry his slowness might of bothered me, but i think he knew he could take his time and put all the love in my food. It was like he was creating a piece of art with each ingredient he was adding on. At first i looked at my husband like-is he seriously going to go this slow with each ingredient?!?! But that quickly turned into me noticing how much detail he is putting into making sure everything is evenly coated and placed properly. You know your so used to places going as quick as possible down the assembly line and just quickly plopping your ingredients on, you never notice how great it is to see them put love in your food. He was making perfect zig zags with all the sauces as if he was doing a plate presentation. Y'all he was like salt bae as he gently coated my nachos with cilantro.Cilantro bae?  It was entertaining to watch and i wish it would of been on a regular plate and not an enclosed box so i can get a proper picture. 
And yes, it was a good as it looked. I usually avoid queso and just get shredded cheese but decided to switch it up and glad i did.....don't skip the queso! My husband got fish tacos, which he said were good but the fish was extra fishy. Which i guess could just mean extra fresh?!? Like the fish smell was not trying to escape his hands after washing them. 
They sell king of pops here which is always great and always have a clean dining room. This place is perfect if it wasn't for the lack of adequate parking. You have to park on the rhino market/burger company lot which is usually packed and still requires you to walk a little; or you can find street parking.....but still a little walk. It was raining so i was not excited about the parking especially on that day.
Anyways, try this place out and prepare to be presently surprised!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and will be coming back! Not only was it yummy but the gentleman who spoke to me (I presume an owner or manager) was super helpful. My bowl was delicious, plentiful, and fresh. The buffalo tofu was flavorful and not too spicy. Oh and they load ya up on gauc if you add it to your meal!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and answered all our questions about menu items. The prices were reasonable and the food is f**king delicious. This is a new favorite."}
{"text":"Your typical Mexican spot.  Not bad not exciting. Basically you take your tortilla and the man well put anything you want in it.  I was bsing with the owner and by them time we were finished my burrito was the size of a woman's purse.  It was friggin gigantic.  Though, I don't expect this to last long as it was more of he was looking for repeat customers.  Otherwsie I would give this 4 stars."}
{"text":"A solid spot for burrito's! All the staple items with fresh ingredients and great offers... Tuesday & Thursday!"}
{"text":"If you like chipotle you will love this place. But they don't have the vegan friendly soy option. Yet. 
The buffalo chicken is house add and fantastic. So if you're feeling like supporting a local place and feel like eating a burrito or taco that you could've gotten at chipotle this is your place. The vegetarian option currently is only sautéed vegetables but otherwise a decent place."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Food is awesome.  I go all the time and never experience rudeness.  U can get your food fast and the food is on point.. Trust me Picante is the best."}
{"text":"It is the one of the places we eat after the Monday Night ride from Uptown Cycles. They have great specials $1 and $2 tacos. The food is always good and fresh. Never had anything bad. The guys that work there are always nice. Good place. Good value and just enjoyable."}
{"text":"Picante is hands down my favorite burrito joint in town(no offense Johnny B's uptown, love you too). Locally owned/operated with awesome people making your food and getting to know you. The steak burrito is one in particular that stands out. Seasonally available Carolina Reaper sauce from Fort Mill is killer. Antwan, Bernie make the experience fun and personal. My family loves this place. Phat Burrito(RIP) fans come to West End to get your burrito fix! Truly do love this place, maybe a bit over the top review due to three after work bourbons."}
{"text":"Great local spot. Comparable to Chipotle, but more reasonably priced and daily specials with discounted or free drinks, cheap craft beer, etc. Craft beer selection isn't great, but at least you have options. Helpings are always heaping. If you felt like it, you could stretch a burrito bowl into two meals."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice.  Three tacos and chips and queso.  Both times the taco meat was cold, so cold the cheese won't even melt--as if they refrigerated it.  The chips are so salty you can barely choke them down.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Lime sublime!  I loved my meal from Picante tonight.  I ordered the fish tacos with black beans, cheese, sour cream, and picante.  I added a bit of the \"hot\" salsa to the top and it was awesome! To boot the price was the 'picante' on top!  Awesome value. 

Picante is keeping it all really fresh tasting with a lime flavor.  They have added this to the chips as well, which was a nice touch!  Even though this is not as close to me as some of the other Mexican fast chains, I will drive there to experience their freshness again! I can confirm that none of the said Mexican chains offer a seafood option...and as a Pescatarian I really appreciate this menu item!"}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the service.  They give you plenty of food, and the food does not make you feel bloated and uncomfortable after consumption. They have very good deals such as $5 Tuesday and Thirsty Thursday.  Parking is very easy, and you never have a long wait in line.  Much better than that other place that sells this type of food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best value.... best taste.... Love this place...
So good that this is my first review in forever !!!  
Better than Moe's and Chipotle.
And not a chain !"}
{"text":"Huge burrito today!  On the spot!  Had to be at least 5lbs....had a hard time working after lunch today.....not complaining at all!  Worth a frequent visit.  Priced well!  I would recommend, great food and service!  I prefer much more than chipotle!"}
{"text":"Came in on Thursday and got the \"special\" chicken burrito with queso. It ended up being $9.49 after tax. I didn't get a drink or chips. Just the burrito and a cup of water. Not sure what kind of special that is. The burrito was good but for that price I could have just gone to qdoba where a steak burrito w queso and guac is cheaper! The only way I'd ever come back here is on a Tuesday when they advertise $5 burritos."}
{"text":"Been working up the road form this lil gem the past couple months and this is one of the best burrito places I've been to. It's setup like a Moe's or chipotle's but thank god no one screams at you when you walk through the door. The owner and staff immediately realized I wasn't a local and we're very friendly so I've been back a couple times and the result is the same, great food n service!"}
{"text":"If you are into Chipotle, this place is a close relative, right down to the looks of the menu up top when you walk in!  Though, it is a bit cheaper, and has cheap ($2) beer selections!

I went here upon the praise from my boyfriend....he seems to really love it, and he wanted me to check it out because of my love for this kind of food.

The one thing I really loved about this place is that they have fish as an option!  I asked, it's Tilapia.  And tasty!  I had a salad topped with Tilapia, tomatoes, olives and both their medium and hot salsa.  The guy who prepared my meal warned that the hot was REALLY hot....I don't exactly agree, but I prefer my food realllllly hot.  The addition of jalepenos on my salad would've been nice!

My guy loves the tacos....that's his go to.  And says they have $1 tacos after 4pm.  They just had a Groupon as well.  For $20 we got 6 tacos, a salad and a drink.  

If you like quick (and cheap) Mexican, check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been there 4 times since they opened for business. I have tried 4 different meats and topping combinations. Steak is my favorite and is better than both Qdoba and Chipotle. I talked with manager to find out what they do to make their steak stand out. He said that they marinate their steak overnight and grill it with some additional herbs and spices. 
Among toppings, Guac is extra but most Mex-Chains charge extra. Again, after talking to the manager, I found out that Guac is free with Veggie entries and is extra with meat entries. Compared to Chipotle, Guac is 39 cents cheaper and is fresh and delish."}
{"text":"Really good burritos.  I think they are pretty comparable to Chipotle, but better than Moe's and Qdoba.  The burritos are usually huge, although you occassionally get someone who makes them a little smaller.  Same for the burrito bowls.  They also have $2 tacos after 4, which is a good deal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner with the family tonight.  Made fresh right in front of you with meat and toppings that you chose.  You can get tacos, burritos, salads or burrito bowls.  Much bigger portion sizes that many of the other similar places.  They had a special with $2 tacos and $2 beers.  We will definitely return.  Nice, new facility."}
{"text":"5 dollar bowl. But holly smokes $1.69 extra for guacamole that is bland. Dame I ended up paying the original price for it. I will say no next time when ask \"guacamole.\" Not only that count your change the cashier don't pay much attention on giving you the correct change. I gave her two 5 dollar bills for a total of $7.49 she gave me .51 cent of change. I was so caught off guard with how expensive the guacamole was I didn't recognize that she shorted me change until I left the building I guess they can consider it as a tip this time"}
{"text":"I enjoy the burrito and burrito bowls here a lot. All of the ingredients look fresh and they're reasonably priced. My only complaint is I wish they didn't run out of tofu all the time! Their buffalo tofu is amazing and the main reason why I come. If you haven't tried it I suggest you do, and please Picante, keep that tofu stocked!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's walkable from my house, the food is good, it's reasonably priced, and IT IS LOCAL! 

The owners are super nice, as are all of the employees. Every time I plan on going here for lunch or supper, I genuinely look forward to the overall experience (interacting with the staff and eating the yummy food). 

I'm super excited about their recent'ish introduction of the nacho bowl. Of the 5 times most recent times I've gone here, I've gotten that... 5 times! Even if you're typically a burrito guy or a taco gal, give the nacho bowl a shot!"}
{"text":"I tried out this place for lunch yesterday and after ambitiously deciding to walk there and back, it was very rewarding. The owner/manager recognized me even though I was sporting my sweaty-overworked look that afternoon.

Because of my famished and starry state of mind, I didn't analyze the menu or the diggs, I got my vegetarian bowl and dipped out.. Tisk Tisk, I know. 

The vegetarian comes with guacamole so I have no price complaints. They offer brown rice, which makes them stand apart in my mind from the other Southwestern burrito chains. Everything look really fresh and well-stocked, that includes the staff... I believe my compostable to-go bowl passed through a total of six pairs hands. Honestly, 12 hands. Now that's service!

My total was $5, with a coupon which wasn't hard to come by. And yes, their interior designer also chose to go with the industrial tin-can theme, but they do have an outdoor patio with umbrellas!"}
{"text":"Avoid.  Avoid.  Avoid.  I selected herb chicken tacos only to discover that the chicken was not fully deboned.  The prices are cheap; a potential trip to a dentistry clinic not so much."}
{"text":"Nice neat looking place with friendly staff. Food not great- steak and chicken had lower quality taste..  Not good texture. Cheese was typical shredded white non- Mexican type... For delicious authentic tacos, try shrimp at Sabor, or pork and more at Tres Amigos..."}
{"text":"It's been at least a year since I been on freedom drive. I live across town close to NoDa and I currently work out in mallard creek, mallard church rd area. But on this occasion I had to travel to the west side for work related reasons. I was gonna drive to south end for a quick lunch but once I turned onto morehead street I seen a big sign from Picante that said \"$2 tacos & $2 beers after 4pm\" not a hard decision to make since I was considering chipotle for lunch anyway. 
Picante shares the same space as the Burger & Co. The inside has that textile mill-warehouse-to-restaurant conversion theme going, that seems to be the new trend in the Charlotte restaurant scene nowadays. They have industrial style chairs and tables a-la chipoptle style. But overall it seems to work, spacing was adequate, the place was clean and everything flowed well and the staff was very friendly.
If your a fan of Moe's, chipotle or salsarita's then you know what to expect. What set it apart for me is the $2 dollar tacos and more options for protein (beef, chicken, steak, pulled pork (carnitas) & shredded beef at no extra cost if you order the tacos. I ordered two tacos, steak and fish. I had a pretty cool.conversation with the guy preparing my order, I had the same toppings on both except I had guac on the steak and a spicy aioli that he recommened on the fish. I'm not much of a fan of mayonnaise based sauces simply because most of them have too much mayo and very little of anything else, but he said it was great so I tried it, and it was a great compliment to the fish. The steak and fish were very well seasoned, put them in a bowl by themselves and they could hold up on thier own, they compliment, not dependent on all the other toppings for flavor. The staffmember prepping my food was not cheap on the meat either, both my tacos were overstuffed, everything was fresh. I was very satisfied after my meal. Two tacos & a beer filled me up like one $6 burrito, with a little bit of change left over. My visit to Picante's was great and I will be going back to the west side more often for more $2 tacos.
For a long time, the only type of food you would find on freedom and the West side of Charlotte is fast food and southern style fried foods. Freedom drive had the reputation of being an area that was dangerous to be in after dark. So I'm glad to see that the current renaissance that is sweeping through Charlotte has not passed over the West side. The rejuvination process has been slow compared to other areas, but there has been progress. The city has taken an interest in revitalizing the freedom area (probably because its right down the street from.panther stadium and practice field) and now the street has new pavement, old historic homes have been renovated, abandoned warehouses and mills have been torn down and replaced with upscale condos and apartments or renovated for retail space and businesses have been moving into the area in droves. The law school is even located just down the road on Wilkinson Blvd. The west side will alway be a black community at its heart, that seems to have carried a lot of negative connotations over the past few decades.  But when the city took interest, so did business and it welcomed a new group of professionals and diverse people to redicover the goodness and potential in the area, slowly erasing the bad stigma that has plagued this side of town for years and restoring pride back into Charlotte's historic black community. Anyway, didn't mean to get all deep and PBS on everybody, just wanted to express that. Go try Picante if your close by sometime, it's another great place for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is solid. Not out of this world good but very far from being bad.

From the moment you walk into this place, you'll immediately think chipotle. The menu that hangs over the counter is almost identical. You pick your food item of choice (burrito, bowl, tacos etc) then load it up with rice, beans, protein, Etc, etc.  

Each time I've come here, I've gotten a burrito and have loaded the thing up until I need a fork lift to carry it out the door. Which is why I'm probably miserable at work afterwards lol...

I love Chipotle ... I really do. But every time I go there for lunch I somehow end up spending $15 somehow....one of my favorite things about Picanté, aside from them switching up their protein options is the fact that they offer $5 burritos or bowls on Tuesday, which is a GREAT deal. 

This is def a good spot if your looking to switch up your lunch options every now and then. Between their $5 burrito deals and them being .5 miles from my office -- I'm certain I will be back."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place as it being called \"better than chipotle\". Now being a big Chipotle fan I had yo see if this was actually true lol. First off it was easy to get to which is always a plus for me being that I'm still fairly new to the city. There was plenty of parking which I also LOVE! The restaurant is pretty large. Even though there were a lot of people we still had no problem finding a seat. I would say the set up is very similar to chipotle. Pick your item of choice (burrito, burrito bowl or nachos) and then you pick your toppings. I opted for the chicken burrito bowl. They also accommodated my son who just wanted rice and beans . The food was great. I finished it all in one setting. Perfect portions of everything that made a very satisfying meal. They also had a lunch special going on for the burritos and burrito bowls. I believe they were $5.50 that day which was nice because usually something like that will cost $8-$10 easily! Overall great atmosphere, great staff and a nice place to have something a little different. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. Owner and his wife are very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Cheaper version Qdoba/chipotle. The buffalo chicken burrito is really good."}
{"text":"So my friend that invited me here said it was like Chipotle but only better.  Eh...I can't say I completely agree with that if I'm honest.  It was actually a bit bland although I only had veggie soft tacos.

Overall, I was not that impressed with what I had but I may return if I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"I have been four or five times and all I can say is that it is fair at best.  The tacos and burritos are very bland.  The owner makes no effort to learn who you are.  This part of town is a very neighborhood friendly place and Picante just does not fit in.  I was so excited to see this go in, however  I will be driving right past it to Chipotle."}
{"text":"If you're on the west side of town looking for quick Mexican fare (that's local!), you've found your place. Affordable, fresh, and filling - yes please.

Choose from a variety of meals (burritos, tacos, burrito-bowls, etc.), and walk down the line picking and choosing what the friendly Picante staff member adds to your dish. Top it off with chips and guac or salsa and a soft drink, and you're all set. 

This place is steps away from where I live, adding even more appeal for the hubby and I to occasionally make our way down to Picante for lunch or dinner. I will say I've been disappointed with flavor in the past (the regular chicken, for example, is nothing to write home about), but you'll get over it when you add all of the tasty additions on top. Shout out to fresh cilantro for always being there for me and my taco bowl."}
{"text":"Until today, I considered myself a Chipotle devotee, but Picante has helped change my mind. 

As a creature of habit, I ALWAYS order a double steak burrito with shredded cheese and quac. 

I'm happy to report that the steak was more flavorful and tender at picante.

I'm a Picante Convert."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays! $5.50 burrito bowls. Hands down best in town and the best queso..no questions about it! You'll see me here every Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late to go lunch after an appointment Uptown.   

The place really looks like a Chipotle.  The menu is similar and easy to read.  You can your choice of burrito / tacos etc, with or without tortilla with choice of protein and beans and then customize with salsa, cheese, guac, sour cream and etc.  

I went with the burrito bowl with chicken and black beans and hot salsa!   Portion size was great.  The hot salsa was killer!  Not much to it but it packed a punch.  The chicken was flavorful and I enjoyed the additional guac.  

The staff was great here - really pleasant and friendly.  

A solid 3 stars for this place."}
{"text":"My first year of law school I ate at Pinky's and Burger Co. almost everyday. Needless to say that'll pack on the lbs. pretty quick. After a while, my classmates and I would explore more and venture into Southend or Dilworth if time permitted. 

But we were really happy when Picante opened up since it's still near campus and it's a change of pace from your burger/diner style joints. 

How's the food? 

It's pretty good. If you are a fan of Chipotle, Qdoba and Moe's, then you'll probably like Picante. The chicken, steak, shredded beef, and fish are really good. They occasionally introduce specials and new items to the menu too (buffalo chicken or philly cheesesteak burritos). They have drink specials and even do punch cards for free burritos.

The owner and his wife are super friendly, as well as the rest of the staff. The price is pretty much on par with the competitors, if not a little lower. 

I'll definitely be making my way to picante in between classes soon!"}
{"text":"Picante is the best!! Friendly staff, great location, and quality food with robust flavors.  One of the best deals in town - their $5 burrito bowl. Chipotle, Moe's, and Phat Burrito won't be seeing me again."}
{"text":"Fresh food and great employees. Took my wife her for the first time and she enjoyed hopefully they can expand to the university area"}
{"text":"The food is amazing however whoever the blonde woman is that was working today when I went in is EXTREMELY RUDE!!! She was not only NOT treating her employees with kindness and respect but she was also very cold and unwelcoming to guests. I am a frequent patron of picante however if this had been my first experience I would definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Picante doesn't stand out from the crowd of chain Mexican-American grab-and-go spots. They are decently priced $5-7 and have a good location without much competition on West blvd.

Let me start out with the positives.... 3 tortilla options (spinach, brown, white) and they offer brown rice in addition to white, very filling (big portion), fairly healthy, and fast. The veggies here looked nicer than other chain places.

On to the dislikes... $1.60 extra to put Guacamole on your burrito ...what?! To be fair they were nice enough to put a little scoop on me for free because management saw me say noooo thank you. Also, I couldn't taste the herbs in the chicken and my rice was a bit tough (even for brown) as I was served the last scoop in the container. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't really good either. My hope is that they will put a little zing into the food to separate it from the competition. 

I am a Guac-fanatic so unfortunately the extra charge will send me straight back to Salsaritas next time I want that type of lunch."}
{"text":"BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE!! They have a greater variety of proteins. They have local brews. They have King of Pops. And, they have delicious queso!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, it was during the first couple weeks after they opened. I got some bland flavors in my burrito and didn't really see any reason to come back. I figured it would be closed in a few months.

Wow, was I wrong. I got perhaps the most delicious chips and queso that I've ever had - well-seasoned and peppered queso dip, not just a cup of cheese. And the burrito didn't disappoint either. This might be my new replacement for Phat Burrito. Seriously, it's local and it's delicious. I guess I initially caught them before they got into their groove, because now they are a serious burrito contender!"}
{"text":"Eat local, support local.

Key word here: fresh. The only freezer they have in this place is in front of the counter and it's filled with King of Pops. That's right, no freezer in the kitchen. 

I hate to even have to use the C word here, but this is similar to a Chipotle. It's fast casual Mexican. However, this is a locally owned and operated restaurant by a husband and wife team. Not a chain. And it's delicious. 

You can score lunch here for less than ten bucks. Tacos, burritos, bowls, salads and lot of different protein options. On Tuesdays, they do all their burritos and burrito bowls for just $5. I always get a burrito bowl when I come here. Tacos are $2 after 4pm every day. All of their salsa and beans are made from scratch with fresh ingredients. I like that there's also a brown rice option. They slow cook the pork and shredded beef for six hours, grind the top round for the ground beef dishes. A ton of work goes into all their food. For the colder months, they just started doing a chicken tortilla soup. 

And as we've all learned in life, guac is always extra."}
{"text":"Picante has a similar concept as Chipotle, but the food taste better and is fresher. I love their buffalo chicken and their queso is amazing. The prices are great too!  Highly recommend checking Picante out."}
{"text":"With better ingredients and recipes, they easily best Moe's, Chipotle, and Salsaritas. No matter what you get, make sure you throw some fish sauce on it."}
{"text":"My 10 year okson was chocking on something while eating dinner from this place and it ended up being something that looks like tape. Upon contacting the establishment I was notified that it's most likely a piece of glove that was cut off from someone's hand. What?! Then the owner non chalantly tells me I can get a credit of $5 once I'm back in the area. 

Update: went in today to get my son a bowl to replace the one with plastic in it and the manager says and I quote \"I wish you wouldn't have written that bad review, I didn't have to do anything about the issue.\"  I made sure I heard correctly by asking him to repeat himself and he did with no issue.  Worst customer service ever and I will never do business there again! He's lucky u don't sue him."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many 'eh' reviews of Picante as I personally really love it and it's one of my go-to quick lunch grabs in the FreeMoreWest neighborhood.  The owners are so nice, the food is fast, and the price is very reasonable, especially compared to Phat or Chipotle.  I really like the fish bowl (ask for the white sauce) and the buffalo chicken bowl.  The also have a philly bowl special one day of the week (Wednesday?) and the Tuesday $5 burrito or bowl is tough to beat!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, authentic food. VERY similar to chipotle except there are more meat options. I loved the ambiance and the staff!"}
{"text":"Not too much new that probably hasn't been brought up in other reviews.  Wanted to give a place local to me a good reivew after a slew of bad reviews.  I just do the $5 burrito Tuesdays which are a more than adequate excuse for not cooking that night.  Ingredients are just as good as the other more well known Mexican places.  And I'm happy they don't give out chips with the burrito because I don't need that extra carbs and sodium anyway.  And it's right off Route 77.  Definitely worth checking out this area if you've never been which feels like a mini NODA."}
{"text":"A-1 service and great burritos. We got there early and by the time we were done eating the line was out the door. And they serve beer. So I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Ok yes, if someone blindfolded you and walked you to the front, you'd immediately think you're in chipotle. It's the same exact concept, menu features and the like, with one exception: It's not chipotle. From what I gather, it's an independent burrito spot, not a chain, which gives this place props. 

I came on $5 tuesday, just before the crowd rolled in (which is right around 11:45) and got the steak burrito bowl. All of the proteins looked fresh, along with the salsas/sides. Overall, I was very pleased with how everything tastes and will certainly come back to check out some of their other specials."}
{"text":"Very screwed up operation, I have given up on them due to the bad service. Went in recently about 6 pm and I was the only customer in the store. Girl behind the counter was Face-timing with her friend while waiting on me and screwed up my order. Young fellow running the cash register then screwed up my order again. I had gotten food to go and halfway home I realized they left out part of my order, and never gave me a receipt. Called back and they were clueless. Also, I question whether the food on the burrito bar was hot enough.  I feel better when I see a little steam rising but there was none. Lukewarm meat = germ factory. Previous visit a month ago I was double-charged for my order, had to go back in to straighten it out. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Chicken bone in my burrito and charged me for guac when i didnt get beans or rice because im diabetic."}
{"text":"I had driven past this place a thousand times and never stopped. My boyfriend had eaten with his friends here in the past and said it was \"pretty good\", so I was excited when a coworker and I went here for lunch. I ordered the buffalo chicken burrito. And. I. Loved. It. 

The food tastes fresh. The owner was friendly. There were a ton of options. The price was fair. The sweet tea was good. Its impossible to finish an entire burrito because they are so huge. Maaaaaaaaan, I like it. 

I went home that night and told my boyfriend that I think it's better than chipotle. He gave me the \"whhhhaaaaat?!\" face, but I stand by my claim. We recently went back together and it confirmed my assertion. The chips could be seasoned better, but in the world of \"Mexican grills\", I think Picante is winning."}
{"text":"Neighborhood place similar to Moe's or Chipotle. I find those places a little better since there are more options. For example, as a vegetarian, at Moe's in a burrito I can opt to choose tofu instead of meat and also put in mixed cooked veggies like peppers and onions. Picante does not have a tofu option. I saw a man making peppers, but it was not available when we ordered so I cannot speak to it being available. Also chips and salsa are not included, they are extra.  Now, on to the positive feedback- the burrito itself was pretty good. I ordered a vegetarian burrito with a spinach wrap, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, cilantro, black olives, onions and pico de gallo salsa. It was decent sized and tasty. Went on a Tuesday/yesterday, which has specialty pricing- $5 burritos and $2 tacos. Also noticed that Thursday's specialty pricing is get a free fountain drink with your burrito purchase. Not too shabby! I'm not in this area of town much, but suppose I would possibly return on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"The burritos are GREAT. I'm a huge Chipotle fan and when I went to Chipotle after having Picante for a few months, I was so unimpressed. Tuesdays is $5 burrito or burrito bowl day, Thursday is Thirsty Thursday and you get a free soft drink with your burrito or burrito bowl. 

I had one of their homemade popsicles and that was pretty great too. The staff and owners are really friendly and they're nice people to brighten a day on a \"blah\" work day.

Totally recommend! They have burrito punch cards too! I'm 2 punch holes away from my free burrito :)"}
{"text":"Only place that offers Buffalo chicken taco's or burritos. All tacos after 4pm are $2 everyday.  Love this place."}
{"text":"What a surprise. Whenever invited to this place, I shrugged it off and went somewhere else. What a fool I've been. The owner is so friendly and the food is fresh. They have a great selection. I hate to make the comparison but they're like a better version of chipotle."}
{"text":"Had to update my review because I recently ate here. 

Service and speed remains pretty quick so don't let the long line deter you. It appears that their menu has changed and is more extensive. They do offer specials during the week. 

I'm still not that big of a fan. The flavors taste off to me. It's good, but not better than competitors. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and while it was good, it took forever to come out and wasn't cheesy at all."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is amazing! Staff is super friendly..!  I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a burrito bowl.
I went on the wild side and let the creator of my bowl choose for me. My bowl turned out beautifully complex! Soooo delicious!!"}
{"text":"I would pick Picante over phat burrito any day! Yeah they don't have the salsa bar but the food makes up for it. 

We walked in yesterday and found $5 burritos and burrito bowls plus $2 tacos everyday after 4p. The staff is superb here, very nice and welcoming. They gave us a whole break down of the options, very cool. I ended up going with the fish burrito while the bf went with the chicken. Wow, I was blown away by the fresh ingredients and the flavorful sauces. My fish burrito was delicious, not too fishy ( the tilapia was seasoned with cumin I think) and that chipotle yum yum sauce is super bomb. Not to mention, the burrito was huge! Phat burrito got nothin on Picante!

We will be regulars no doubt! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito bowl in CLT! Not to mention all the choices of meat, and toppings blow Chipotle away."}
{"text":"Not sure why people things they are similar to Chipotle. Food was flavorless. I got the burrito with herb chicken."}
{"text":"Extremely similar to Chipotle. BUT BETTER! I had carnitas and the meat was so tender and fresh. Delicious salsas, perfect guacamole, limey chips, and a small beer selection. Outdoor seating. They have a little popsicle cooler- try the key lime pie!"}
