{"text":"I have gone to this place a few times for take out, and I'm not impressed. the food is okay, and the prices are okay. I'd come back some times."}
{"text":"New Management, but a still as good as the original owners, 
There is a great selection at this Take out only style restaurant, For a family of for I recommended Dinner for 4 A, it is a good value with a large quantity for under 40$.

There are a mixture of more classic Chinese as well as your standard Canadian Chinese., My favourite item there is the Chicken wings.
Enjoy"}
{"text":"We have been ordering take out from here for years and we really enjoyed the food. Our last two visits were very disappointing as everything was bland and tasteless. Looking for a new take out place. No dining in here."}
