{"text":"It's now called Grits N Greens Southern Cuisine.  Pimento cheese burger and fries was excellent.  Great wait staff!  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed the first time we went to 125 North Main. I ordered the salmon patties special, and got a plate filled with patties, roasted potatoes, and \"custard-style\" mac & cheese. It all seemed pretty good, but there were rough spots. The hush puppies had an off-putting, fishy taste to them, almost certainly deep fried in the same oil as fish. And the \"roasted\" potatoes... seemed to be just heated in the oven, not roasted per se. But we've been back twice since then, and it's gotten better and better every time. The CFS is delicious, some of the best I've ever had. And my GF got the roasted potatoes last time... and they were roasted.

125 also does desserts. Basically, they have a chocolate cake with homemade icing that had candy pieces crushed up in it. The Reese's was OK (too sweet and dry to my taste), the Heath Bar was pretty good (although too much of a good thing), but the Butterfinger was excellent.

Prices are completely reasonable (usually $16-$18 for two of us, including one dessert). And the sweet tea's really good, too!"}
{"text":"The food was very good seem to not have a lot of extra sugar which is great. Porkchops were done correctly broccoli casserole was excellent and the tea was also great. Will visit again soon"}
{"text":"The new name is Grits N Greens on the building. I dont know about Christophers. but this is my new favorite place in NC. Burgers are delicious. Breakfast is great too. I could rave for days about this place"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. You can tell the new owner of this restaurant really wants to cook great food and make his customers happy. This is the best little local spot you can find. I support this little place 100%."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day it was pretty good. We will try it again for sure. 

My kid ordered a grilled cheese and loved it. The fries were amazing! They are cooked perfectly and have some sort of crunchy breading that really takes them over the top. Possibly the best fries we have had. I hope these are made in house. 

 My spouse ordered some big burger with slaw and chili. This thing was massive! He had trouble finishing it but made a valiant effort. The burger tasted like it was handmade and the chili/slaw combo tasted like a true southerner was behind it. It was so big we all kinda took bites off of it. Then he got a heaping mound of those delicious fries to go with it. 

I ordered a BLT on a wrap. It was mostly wrap, few bits of tomato, one sad lettuce slice, and hardly any bacon. Not gonna lie I was a little disappointed after seeing what the other two ordered. Even on bread this would have been a sad little sandwich. I also tried to order 3 different sides but they seemed to be out of everything and the waitress didn't know what they had so she kept coming back. You can tell that communication was lacking between the front and back of the house. She was super sweet though and I could tell she sincerely felt bad so I wasn't annoyed by it at all. It happens to everyone. I felt bad for her she should have been aware that items were not on the menu. Finally I ordered sweet potato fries which they had. They came out after awhile which was fine b/c my wrap was so small everyone else had a while to go. The sweet potato fries over all were delicious. I had to dab the grease off with a napkin. Which I guess would be normal if the kitchen was rushing to get them out.  There was no attempt to season them and it didn't come with any sort of special sauce which I found odd. However, I love plain sweet potato in any form so it didn't bother me to much and the oil was clean so I was happy. 

We all ordered banana pudding which was an epic fail on the cooks part. I would have given 4 stars but this was such a fail I was upset we didn't have our phones to take a picture of it. It was all cookie, really dry, old looking bananas, and literally no pudding. We assumed the pudding was absorbed by all the cookies and this was an old batch. My husband is a huge banana pudding fan and was really disappointed in it. Next time we will try the cake! 

The price of this place was really great though for the burger and kids meal. The BLT wrap needs some attention and the banana pudding needs to be taken off the menu or made properly. Outside of those two things we enjoyed our meal. The place was clean, service was good, took awhile to get BUT everything is made to order so don't be annoyed by this. I would rather wait for good food than be served quick crap in a heart beat."}
{"text":"We've returned here after it was destroyed by fire in the mid-00s.  The wait staff is OUTSTANDING.  The owner seems to really have made a commitment to good food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is about one level above Waffle House. I ordered the ribeye sandwich...they literally just slapped an entire (cheap) ribeye steak onto an open hoagie roll and served it. There was absolutely no way to close the sandwich. I had to take it off of my plate and set it on the table, use my plate as a cutting board to do the cook's job for him, then put the whole sandwich back together again. A complete mess, and a total PITA. 

Aside from that, the fries were as greasy as I have ever had, the sweet tea tasted like dishwater, and the \"soul rolls\" were just...bizarre. It was not a good dining experience at all. The predominant flavor on my plate was grease, if that tells you anything. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Okay food. Local family style restaurant. On way from airport to asheville. Good if you don't want fast food."}
{"text":"This place is now called Grits N Greens and it is not good!! The meatloaf was mushy and covered in some disgusting BBQ sauce, the green beans were straight from a can, no salt, no seasoning, no flavor! I don't know what the corn bread was, but it was not cornbread, it had a very weird flavor and texture, more like vanilla cake. I would not recommend this place to anybody!"}
