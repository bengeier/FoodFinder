{"text":"Delicious pizza, wings, and calzones! The Red O calzone is a favorite. We always choose Red Onion on pizza/wing nights, especially over a chain. Great local place."}
{"text":"Sounds weird but if my grandkids want a burger this is where they want to go and I have to agree that they are fabulous here!!
My favorite is the Philly cheesesteak sub. And the pizza is always the best in town 
Great staff too"}
{"text":"Got the steak salad...definitely not worth the $12 when there are 6 fries and 4 small pieces of steak on it. The only bonus is that it was super fast delivery."}
{"text":"We've lived in Bethel Park for 10+ years, this is our favorite place for pizza and hoagies.  Fresh ingredients, great menu, haven't ordered anything we didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"I always seemed to forget about Red Onion only because I didn't have the menu handy ...But one day when my wife and I were on the way home she said 'hey how bout red onion\" I said Why not.....Well glad I came back ...the steak hoagies are awesome and filled with steak. The pizza is great also ....if you ask for light tomato sauce you get light tomato sauce unline other places where its still a puddle of sauce. The fries both regular and red onion style are awesome and well worth the money. Needless to say we have ordered a few times since then and I will keep going back"}
{"text":"Just got done eating there meatball bake and my husband and granddaughter is having the pizza service is good I usually pick up but today had it delivered food is good"}
{"text":"Have gone here for years!! Miss the old owner but still a wonderful place. The steak hoagie is my favorite! We always order at home and at work! The delivery people always are nice, strike a conversation, and are timely! Thanks for the great service and food!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here awhile ago. After my experience with this place, I'll never do business with this place again. I ordered delivery and was given approximately 45 minutes for delivery time. When it took twice that amount of time, I became very frustrated. So I posted about my experience on another review site. About 3 minutes after my review was posted, the manager began calling my mom's phone, extremely irate and demanding that I take the review down. I think that is very unprofessional. If you wanted me to change my review, call and ask how the experience could be made better. I took the hit on the food because I was honestly afraid to eat it after getting yelled at by the manager. My mom said her food was ok. Good luck staying in business with that attitude."}
{"text":"I love Red Onion. Plenty of pizza sizes and options to choose from and lots of sandwiches too. We are never disappointed. I normally get them when with family in South Park and have gotten it delivered to the Fire Hall on Election day too. Always good. My family praises them all of the time too, even before they moved out of South Park into Bethel Park. Though I was still in the Air Force when that happened. I LOVE their Red Onion fries too."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good fast delivery and affordable I order from this place weekly. If you ever order or stop in try the pepperoni calzone!"}
{"text":"Red Onion is my go to.  I'm in the neighborhood and I couldn't be happier. Not familiar with there delivery because always pick up. Great talking to the staff and the awesome phone girls. They rock. Pizza is my favorite. Try the Hawaiian. Spot on!  Wish they would offer some coupons on Yelp. 5 Stars in my book!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Italian hoagie and the Veggie hoagie which ended up being very good. They tasted almost as good as Danny's Hoagies and were cheaper. They were delivered quickly and will definitely order from them again....I still do not understand the name though."}
{"text":"I would put my money on this establishment in a \"pizza off\" any day.  Best pizza in Allegheny County hands down..  Needs to expand north and south and show people what real pizza tastes like..."}
{"text":"Excellent hoagies. The bread is very good and the hoagies are loaded fairly well. Staff is always cordial."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here in the past without issue. However, my order today was not only late, but wrong. To top it off, the driver didn't have enough change for a $20 and I ended up having to give him more of a tip than I think he deserved. He was 30 minutes late and I ended up having to tip him over 20%! I won't be ordering from here again. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been so impressed with this place that I've continued to order and try new things over the past month. I have yet to be disappointed. The chef salad is always fresh and delicious ... I swear that salad could feed 3 people. The gyro is amazing, just as good if not better than Mike & Tony's in downtown. I tried a pizza with gyro meat on it ... Sounds odd, but it was OMG good. I will continue to patronize this amazingly good restaurant."}
