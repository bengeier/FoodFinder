{"text":"So solid, I love this place. Great atmosphere, often busy but never crowed. Bar and table service are always great. Lots of vegetarian options, and their truffle fries with Parmesan are addicting. One of the best Manhattans I've had around, too. I've not tried the brunch yet but hope to, soon!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant along Detroit in Lakewood.  As far as nearby options, this is one of the better ones.  Plenty of offerings for all palettes and appetites.  I tried the calamari small plate and the Burger.  The fries were very good!  The meat was high caliber, hand crafted patties on a brioche bun.  Picketed red onions, white cheddar and bacon top it off.  They change the menu with the season, so it's worth a follow up visit.  Good for any occasion, large or small group, fine or casual.  The servers were awkward.  They were attentive and got the job done, but they were a little off."}
{"text":"Overpriced Bar Food and Fair Service. Menu is limited.  We got fish and chips and veg burger sliders. There was more batter than fish and 3 sliders wasn't enough for a big plate. There was a hair in the side salad and the beer glass had lipstick on it."}
{"text":"The food is definitely solid. It's a nice looking space with attentive staff. I am biased a bit because I work and live close, so 50% off service industry drink prices are a drawing point. You will have a lot of other restaurant workers night-capping there frequently, but that's a good thing. It's a chill late vibe. The owner knows how to treat the locals, as well as the newcomers.
I have eaten here enough to say that all though the smaller menu is a little pricey. It has never disappointed. My favorite item being the short ribs. 
I don't know how much they cater to dietary needs because I don't follow any diet or have any food allergies, but the menu always offers at least ample vegetarian options.
All in all, it's a staple in Lakewood dining with a very conscientious owner."}
{"text":"Also a nice dollar taco spot! (2-3 dollar spot). Seems to have decent food, fast and good service. Good portions. Tons of beer choices."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I have heard good things about this place, this is the only reason why I have tried it...3 times. This time is my last.  
The first two times I went for brunch.  The last time was for the dinner service.  For dinner, my boyfriend and I ordered the Goat Cheese Deviled Eggs, the Pepper-Crusted Ahi Tuna, and the Mussels with a tomato fennel broth.  We kept the menu because we wanted to order an entree as well, but we hadn't decided yet. Our appetizers came out and after trying them, we were not excited or interested in ordering more.  
The Deviled Eggs were fine, couldn't taste the goat cheese, but I could have made the same at home, and for $3 an egg, I should have.  
The Mussels were absolutely terrible.  The tomato-fennel broth was bland and had a terrible, mushy texture.  Half the mussel shells were missing the mussels, and they were not fresh.
Lastly, the Ahi Tuna. Noticeably frozen tuna. Bland. The pepper crust was so overwhelming and with a delicate fish like tuna, RAW tuna, it was just bad. The chef should know better.
I read reviews about the awesome beer list here.... Any of the beers can be found cheaper elsewhere.
Won't be back. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Deagan's, how do I love you? Let me count the ways.  They have a spectacular beer list, stellar food, awesome service, and a Sunday brunch complete with a bloody Mary bar that will blow your mind.  I have been going here since they opened and have enjoyed experiencing the evolution of their ever changing menu.  They have almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon-they used to call them devils on horseback- that are my all time favorite appetizer.  The mixed nuts are heavenly as well. I've always like the concept of small and large plates-even though small is a misnomer for some of the dishes, you can mix and match a few things that way.  Their chicken and waffle is divine.  Seriously if you don't like perfectly fried chicken and sweet, fluffy waffles together, I just can't relate to you.  They also make a mean fish and chips.  There's a plethora of meats and seafood to choose from AND they also have a vegan night(Wednesday).  Taco Tuesday is usually packed, but worth the wait.  As I said before about the Sunday brunch, it is a great reason to crawl out from under a hangover.  Their bloody Mary bar is fully loaded with so many ingredients and they also have mimosas in multiple flavors.  The brunch menu seems to change frequently as well, but I suggest the sausage gravy, house made donuts,  grits, and the hash and eggs-not necessarily all at once, but hey, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  If all this praise is not enough, the atmosphere is ubercool.  It's hard to choose where to go in this particular area since there are SO MANY great places around, but Deagan's always is  and always will be top on my list."}
{"text":"I eat at Deagans about once every 10 days (meaning weekly except when we miss a week).  The food is consistently good, the beer selection is awesome, the staff go out of their way for you.  It is a 5 star gastropub and  you should go (if gastropubs appeal to you and you're not afraid of pommes)."}
{"text":"This was only my wife's and my second visit to Deagan's which today was for lunch. Weather was warm for February but still a bit brisk. After arrival we were eventually seated. Unfortunately it was just under the air intake screen for the HVAC unit. Very drafty. We asked to be moved (there were only a moderate amount of customers as it was 12:45pm) and were quickly moved to a two top near the bar. Much better. Unfortunately in the move we must have been lost because we sat for nearly 15 minutes before our server showed up. We selected our beer choices and since we had been sitting for so long with our menus we also ordered lunch. My wife chose the cheese sandwich with tomato bisque and I chose the special chorizo minestrone soup as a starter and the beef tamales for my entree. Dispute what appeared to be an abundant amount of wait staff we waited for a VERY long time for our meals. I eventually asked about my cup of soup and our server responded with \"oh it should have been out by now\". Once the soup arrived I was pleasantly surprised. Very flavorful, complete with al dente carrots, spices but not over the top flavor. Unfortunately due to the lack of attention of our server our entrees quickly followed and I had a cup of soup and a hot entree at the time. We both enjoyed our entrees. The cheese sandwich was very nicely grilled, excellent flavor on the cheese and nice bacon to top off the sandwich. The tomato bisque was smooth, rich in flavor and very good. My tamales were very moist and the moo sauces were excellent. The red mole had smoke and a kick to it. The green mole was sweeter and also very flavorful. Accompanied by rice the dish was very good. 

The experience was ok given the poor service. The food was excellent. There was a total lack of management present given the abundance of servers, the lack of a large crowd and the very slow service. 

We are divided on a return visit. Being from the east side, the distance involved in getting here and the abundance of excellent choices elsewhere leaves us unsure about a third visit."}
{"text":"My last few trips had been rather disappointing. The portions have gotten smaller with the prices increasing. 

The quality of food is very nice, but for the cost you could do better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Reasonable drink selection. Food over salted. Would got go back for drinks and atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Totally gone down hill these past couple of years. Of really a fan anymore. Its too bad, I send to really like the place. Miss the better food, better service, and better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Deagans great menu is back.  The service is consistently very good. The interior is very handsome."}
{"text":"We've been back to deagans a lot! The new Tater tots are so good and I can't not order a cheese/meet board when I go, I love all the extras! Can't go wrong with the brunch menu. The DKB breakfast is a delicious classic and the brunch burger is great!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience a couple weeks ago for Sunday brunch. We came about 1:15, with a party of 6, we were told that we would be sat in 20 minutes...we didn't get sat until 215, we didn't get our drinks until 235, and when it came time to order, they were out of over half the brunch menu, but would NOT allow us to order lunch.....which doesn't start til 3... The server even asked if we wanted to sit and wait a half hour for the lunch menus to come out...ARE YOU KIDDING? We ordered an app, came out with our entrees, which were all the same because they were out of everything else.. The burgers were nothing special and we will never go back there again. Terrible terrible experience."}
{"text":"Good food, nice bar atmosphere, diverse collection of brews, great service. Super solid."}
{"text":"Growing Pains:
Have been back twice -- once, we ended up leaving because a \"15-minute wait\" turned into 45 with no end in sight and a friend's baby was along for the ride. I don't fault Deagen's for being busy -- I'm glad to see that this deserving place is drawing in the crowds...that being said, their staff needs to get past the learning curve for more accurately estimating wait times so that people can make an educated decision on whether to wait or stay.

On the second return, we got a table, and the food and service was good, though not quite as memorable as my first time there (calamari was lackluster, brussel sprouts not quite as savory). However, I again chalk this up to growing pains -- still a fantastic experience overall and one of my favorite places on the west side."}
{"text":"What happened Deagan's? You used to be our go-to place until you changed chefs. Ever since that happened, we've had nothing but disappointing visits. My girlfriends and I used to go every other weekend if not more and now I'm not sure we'll ever go again."}
{"text":"Their special mac and cheese with shallots and peas is awesome!!! Great atmosphere and service!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about Deagan's because it is basically a trendy bar that serves food, in a place where a number of previous bars have come and gone, and in the past I've been less than impressed with some of its contemporaries like Melt.  However, after many rave reviews from foodie friends, we decided to check the place out and it totally lived up to its hype.  

The list of beers on tap (I don't do bottles in a gastropub, bottles are for drinking at home) was nice - my husband could get his cherished Guinness and I could pick something flavored to my taste.  For those complaining about the food menu being small, I would rather a place do one page of dishes really well than have everything and the kitchen sink on there and do half of it badly.  I went for the chicken and waffles and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Nice n' moist and with a lot of savory touches that balanced the sweetness of the syrup.  They came on a bed of brussels sprouts, which are one of my least favorite vegetables - let's just say I feel about brussels sprouts the way George Bush Sr. felt about broccoli - but they even managed to make the sprouts taste good!  If you can make me clean brussels sprouts off my plate and go mm mm good, you deserve at least four stars right there.  Husband was happy with his steak as well.  

I'll confess to being mildly disappointed in the cheese and meat board appetizer because it (a) contained some sort of cracker jack popcorn as one of the ingredients that didn't fit with the other items very well and (b) we ordered a cheese, prosciutto and duck and while there were reasonable dollops of the cheese and prosciutto, we got ONE little slice of duck - not even enough to share between two people - and hidden under piles of the other stuff so we had to search for it on the plate.  Not acceptable - I expect there to be enough of each meat and cheese that each person can have 2 crackers' worth.  However, everything else was so good I decided not to take off a star for lack of duck.  

The servers are more hipster bar types than trained pros, but they were enthusiastic, and our main table server checked on us a lot.  Food was delivered quickly despite the restaurant being very full, and we were done in an hour.  I also really appreciate that Deagan's has wood paneling and upholstery that absorbs a lot of the noise when the restaurant is full, especially since this is a kid-friendly establishment and there were people sitting near us with toddlers.  You could still hear the buzz of people but I did not have to shout at my husband to converse.  I wish more restaurants would take a lesson from this.  

Overall, very good experience for the money spent.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok.  I feel like I have to update my Deagan's review after going back a few times.  My first visit was right before their glowing write up in Scene, so I'm hoping that buzz hasn't ruined the place for good-that maybe there are just some growing pains.

5 stars stands for the beer/drink menu alone.  Try the shandygaff (Bell's Two Hearted and ginger beer).  The food has been kind of hit-or-miss though.  The frites I had previously raved about haven't been quite as good the past time or two I went, though everyone I've gone with has had no problem polishing them off.  Also, the veggie burger should not be called a \"burger\" at all (it's quite mushy with nothing that really holds it together, or on the bun), but the flavor of it is right on.  Both salads on the menu are delish as is the eggplant small plate.

I'll keep chasing the high from my first Deagan's visit at least for a little while, since it's close to home, but I can't stick with my 5 star rating."}
{"text":"A lot of people love this place but I'd say it's ok, not awesome and here's why: it's good but it won't wow you and it should for the money. Deagen's is East Coast prices for Midwest food (albeit trendy Midwest food). The atmosphere is fun and it's large so they can accommodate groups but expect to wait to be seated.  You'll find the waitstaff is always friendly but not super attentive and the food is definitely good but it won't blow your mind. Again, none of this would be so bothersome if it weren't overpriced. Two exceptions: order the chicken and waffles because it is divine. I repeat: divine.  Also, if you're into mixed drinks that aren't overly sweet, get the Moscow Mule - it's a great lime/mint/ginger concoction. Be prepared: it does seem to attract a certain subset of of career-aged white people who think they're too cool for school."}
{"text":"Really great variety of pub food with a chef's touch

Ribs: 5/5
Mac&Cheese: 5/5
Biscuits & Gravy: 4/5

Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Have you ever been set up with someone and on paper they look fantastic?  \"Entrepreneur\", \"loves his mom\", \"great sense of humor\" turns out to be \"unemployed\", \"lives with his mom\", and \"laughs at all of his own jokes.\"  Thats how I would describe this restaurant.  The menu looks like it would be fantastic.  Homemade donuts!  Yes, please.  Truffle fries!  Mmmm.  Chicken and waffles!  Let's do this!
Unfortunately the donuts (chocolate cheesecake filled the day I was there) were just so-so.  The chocolate on top was really salty and they weren't served warm as I anticipated.  I mean, I took one home.  Who doesn't eat both donuts?
The truffle fries weren't crispy.  It's pretty hard to screw up fries and when I'm paying $7 for an order of fries they better be good.  I'd prefer McDonalds over these...or El Carnicero...now those are some good fries!
The chicken and waffles were served with beans.  That was just strange to me.  Plus the chicken was a bit chewy.
Service was good.  Not overly friendly but prompt.  Atmosphere was good but didn't make up for the high prices and below average food.
All in all....there won't be a second date."}
{"text":"I liked this place better before the original chef left. The quality and creativity seems to have declined. The last time I went was for breakfast. We were told we couldn't order the sausage gravy and biscuits because the gravy had been burned. While I appreciate the honesty, it seems like a bad call to admit that kind of a kitchen fail at a gastropub to customers. I've thought about giving it another try, but after weighing the prices against the expected quality, I haven't been swayed to return."}
{"text":"Classy styling. Definitely fits into the gastropub style. Get the house fries. Do it.

Came with three friends. I got the salmon, which was INCREDIBLE. It was perfectly seared and spiced. My buddies weren't impressed with their meals. Service was decent, nothing incredible.

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to check this place out, so last night was the night. Looks like a place to sit at the bar & meet up with friends or at nearby tables when u walk in; all wood, average, very casual atmosphere. Food was very disappointing. My husband ordered a maple glazed salmon which was served as a small square on top of 1/2 a cup of cubed squash & sauteed Swiss chard- that's it- No sides whatsoever were served with it & it cost $17. I ordered the falafel sliders which consisted of only 2 small, dry falafel patties in small pita pockets even smaller than the patties, with maybe 1/2 cup of greens served on the plate & tahini sauce in a tiny dish on the side. Again, no sides, & this cost $12. We ordered a piece of cheesecake for dessert because my husband was hungry, & it was average in size for us to split, but again, nothing memorable. It was disappointing because the menu is interesting & different- food quality was good, just need to increase portions or add a side or two to the plates."}
{"text":"I have been to Deagan's a couple of times and each time, it's been really good.  

The service is top-notch, and the waitresses are consistently on the ball.  Although, once or twice, the hostesses seemed a little confused.  I said I was meeting a couple of the guys there, so she walked me over to a table with a retired couple and asked, \"Are these your friends?\" I politely said, \"no,\" and saddled up to the bar.  When one of my friends showed up, she did the same thing...took him to the same table.  Really strange.  I can't imagine what this couple was thinking either!  

The bar is great!  The bartenders are very knowledgeable, even on some old-school drinks...stuff like my grandparents used to drink, like Harvey Wallbanger, Rusty Nail and Rob Roy...this older couple at the bar kept ordering them and the bartender kept knocking them out like she'd been making them since the '40's.  The selection of beer is tremendous, as is the liquor.  

The food is very good.  I've been there for Taco Tuesday, which is crowded, but worth it.  The standard are beef, chicken, tuna and a vegetarian taco.  Additionally, there are weekly special tacos.  Definitely get the beef and tuna tacos, but you must try at least one of the specials.  The Duck Confit taco has been my favorite so far. 

From the \"Apps\" side of the menu, the Deviled Eggs are very tasty...nice creamy yolk mixed with goat cheese and what I think is Coleman's English mustard, which give them a nice spicy zing.  The Day Oysters are also very good. Fresh, sweet, and salty, with a delicious choice of champagne mignonette and chili cocktail sauce.  

On the dinner menu, I love the Hanger Steak Frites.  Really, a classic French-style with perfectly cooked fries, and a side of house-made steak sauces.  I'm not really a \"sauce guy\" and this beautiful piece of meat certainly doesn't need it.  Cooked perfectly medium-rare...I'm actually dreaming about it right now...

Additionally, they have a really good selection of charcuterie, wine and cheese boards...at last count, 6 kinds of cheese, and 5 types of meat to pair with your beer or wine of choice.  But, why screw around...go right to the bottom and get \"THE BIG BOARD!\"  (Be sure to yell it, too...just like George C. Scott in \"Dr. Strangelove\"...I'm sure the staff isn't sick of that one!)  \"THE BIG BOARD\" is a selection of all of the meats and cheeses, with assorted crackers, fresh and dried fruits, nuts, olives, pickles, etc...It's great for just sitting at the bar, sipping a beer or cocktail and leisurely grazing.  

Keep up the great work, Deagan's!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Attended the Mother's Day Brunch because they use their regular brunch menu. It sure beats paying for prime rib that I'm not going to eat. 

Overall we had a great experience! The food was hot, well prepared, and served quickly. We will be back for another brunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent elevated pub fare. Vegan and gluten free options are available. Wide selection of drinks. Great location to stop for an appetizer and a drink while exploring downtown Lakewood."}
{"text":"The best thing about Deagan's is that their menu is constantly updating. They use locally grown products when available and their menu changes according to what fruits and vegetables are in season. 

In a town with stiff restaurant competition, they bring something new to the table (literally and figuratively). 

Last time I was there I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, the portion size was large, and delicious. I look forward to seeing what new items will be on the menu next time I go."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night! They take reservations for parties of 8 or more. I called
About an hour before we went and they were able to accommodate us! The hostess and waitress were every attentive. We all ordered something different an it was all good!"}
{"text":"Wow Deagans! one of my favorite spots in Lakewood. Awesome Bar and the Shrimp tacos with micro cilantro are to dye for. If you are looking for a lax place to hang out with friends and enjoy good drinks and small plates hit up Deagans in Lakewood. Customer service second to none."}
{"text":"At Lunch. Me, a $14 crock of Lobster Mac and Cheese with a little salad was delightfully delicious and so very yummy.  My friend ordered Surf and Turf $12. good petite filet maybe 4 oz., 3-4 shrimp with tails on and too many different types of roasted veggies. The filet ,mashed potatoes and veggies might have been better with the tails off the few shrimp and just roasted zucchini, carrots, brussel sprouts, beets for color and plate appearance instead of the roasted melange of mostly white veggies we couldn't tell apart. I asked the server for bread to wipe out my bowl as I was nearing sadness ....the bottom of my crock. Took a while maybe for the toasting of the hard dry bread we were served or maybe because she seemed to have all the tables. As I went to the impeccably clean ladies room I heard her offer a table to the leaning/eating bartender. Thought I left my car key so I climbed back up the STAIRS at the back entrance and went back to look on the table. Asked about and was given a copy of the children's menu. One was provided and I will post it here. There is an entrance off of Detroit Ave. but someone else will have to report if that one is \"broken leg\"  friendly."}
{"text":"Deagan's is not only an exciting restaurant (pub, gastro-whatever, bar, etc), but also a sign that this area of Lakewood has its very own growth and unique life and promise.  

Finally people are learning that Lakewood doesn't need another \"sports bar\" ... it needs unique, affordable places to gather with friends and family while experiencing the variety of food and drink that come with an eclectic city that is home to  a diverse and lively group of people.

Deagan's has an open, lively feel and seems welcoming to people of all textures, smells and flavors.  We brought a small party of 7 and we were seated in a cozy room where heavily tattooed ladies sat across the way from a lovely group of 70-somethings.  Truly a sign that this is a warm place for all types of people. 

The prices were very reasonable and the staff was knowledgable and friendly.  Our waitress used the no-write memory technique which always gives me a little anxiety (maybe they do it so I'll drink more ;) ... but she managed to get the order perfect.  The menu is fun and has an experimental vibe to it  - everything was great - without exception.

We also managed to meet 2 of the owners and they were lively and involved as well as friendly and wanting feedback. They genuinely seemed to be really excited about this place ...just like me."}
{"text":"Deagan's served sour milk to our one and two year-old children.

Our waitress apologized and explained that the milk had an expiration date of July 4th...we were there on July 10!!  Not much consolation two the two young customers who were extremely unhappy about their drinks. 

Needless to say the entire experience left a sour taste in our mouths.

Deagan's WAS one of our go-to family friendly restaurants.  Obviously, the lack of food quality has taken them off the list."}
{"text":"Great service and lots of choices of beer on tap. It is a very diverse menu, different from a lot of the restaurants and bars in the area. The brunch there is def something worth checking out."}
{"text":"Excellent from seating to service to food.  Our waitress was amazing.  She took the time to explain to our guest all the different things on the menu.  We had chicken enchiladas, chicken club and toasted cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato bisque.  All the food was fabulous--but especially the two soups:  tomato bisque and white bean chicken chili.  The toasted cheese sandwich was perfect--perfectly crisp, perfectly balanced with cheese and bacon, and perfect temperature when served.  Dipped in the bisque--priceless!!!
Prices are more than fair for the quality of food we have had there on many occasions.  When we have anyone visiting and they say, \"hey, let's get something to eat\", we walk down to Deagan's.  We can always count on great food, great atmosphere and a memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"First time dining at Deagans Kitchen and a part from the given Friday night wait, had an otherwise flawless dinner. I knew the bacon wrapped scallop appetizer would be amazing. After removing a scallop from the wood skewer, I licked my fingers and was treated to a nice grill flavor before even eating any scallops. My drink was a beer cocktail comprised of bells ale and ginger which unfortunately tasted like an ordinary Belgian white. The popcorn shrimp tacos were spicy, light and flavorful with the lime crema adding a nice touch. Great good great atmosphere, would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for our New Year's Eve dinner and sadly left disappointed. I ordered the spiced salmon; it initially seemed fine from the outside, but once I dissected and looked inside it was still raw. I alerted the waitress, and my plate returned apparently heated in a microwave, with it still mostly raw. I couldn't stomach to finish anything. The smashed potatoes it came with were also literally just a boiled smashed potato with no seasoning.

I'm giving 2 starts instead of 1 because my husband and friends' dinners were great (chicken & waffles and special NYE filet). The NYE special corn and crab bisque was also really good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, as I had heard great things! A girlfriend and I went on a Saturday afternoon (2pm ish) and it was nearly empty. We sat for ten minutes with no sign of a server. I asked a waitress if she could please send over our server and with an eye roll, went and found Andy (the waiter). He came over with an annoyed attitude, took our order and left. When the same waitress who rolled her eyes earlier brought my salad, it had bacon on it (I asked that be kept off as I am a vegetarian) .. I told her and she was visually annoyed. She told Andy who came over and mumbled \"I must have not heard you say no bacon\" insinuating I didn't tell him. He ended up bringing me out a new one but it was after he passively aggressively tried to call me a liar.

Basically, the servers acted like they didn't want to be there and were BEYOND rude. Food was fine .. But I would never return. I don't pay to go to a restaurant to be treated poorly and eat OK good."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. Came in for date night with my bf and it wasn't very busy for a Saturday at 6pm. We decided to sit at the bar so we didn't feel rushed and good thing we did. By 7 this place was hoppin at the bar and a wait list for tables. 

I found a new favorite beer- Abita Purple Haze. A raspberry wheat but not sweet. Glad to see there was a variety of beers to try and always changing according to the menu. 

To start we tried the deviled eggs. For $3 you got 2 eggs, and I was only able to eat 1. They were made with goat cheese and english mustard. They were rich but very good. Made us want to go home and experiment with our own deviled eggs.

After another round of beers we ordered the side of pork Brussels sprouts, Peking Duck Confit Mac -n- Cheese, and Veg Burger Sliders. I couldn't get enough of any thing. 

The Brussels sprouts were tender but still crunchy and the bits of bacon added depth and flavor. The Mac-n-Cheese was rich and I kept going back for more. A decent size crock too for the price. The veg burgers were moist and full of flavor. You got 2 sliders and a good portion of frites with parm cheese on top.  

As the night went out I saw more and more things I HAVE to try. The mussels must be a hot item, I saw many of them at the bar and being sent out to tables. We decided the next time we stop in we will go for a heaping pile of mussels and perhaps a meat and cheese board. 

It's easy to fall in love with Deagan's. I plan to make this a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing meal. Ordered their \"everyone's favorite\" Mac & Cheese. $16.00. Mac and cheese with chicken, tomatoes and wilted spinach. The flavor was wonderful.  But where was the chicken? I found two pieces under the Mammoth mound of wilted spinach about 1 in by ¼ in resembling the Tyson chicken breast strips.  I would of been happy with just the Mac and cheese and tomatoes and some spinach and no chicken but not for $16.00.  I mean, it was vegan night, but not what I was going for."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh takes of traditional comfort foods, this is the place for you. I tried the deviled egg (just 1 for $3) with goat cheese mixed in. Very creamy. It was good, well presented but just not my favorite version of that dish. My husband had the Mac and cheese and enjoyed it although a bit light on the chicken. Nonetheless he couldn't finish it. I had the vegan stuffed peppers. It was good but light on flavor. The tomato ragout was amazing and fresh. I couldn't finish it all either. We split the vegan moon pie - a very different spin on that desert, interesting combination of flavors. Definitely enough for two (as was the cheese cake). It was good - complicated but tasty. A bit hard to break through the outer chocolate - we thought we might shoot some it across the room or onto us. 
It's a big place with a full wrap around bar. The waitress was a little cool but helpful with our questions.  It wasn't very busy.  
Street parking. Old factory  building so interesting place."}
{"text":"First of all what can you say but what a great place hang out with friends and eat a great meal all at once.

  It was a Saturday night, there were six in our party, no fuss, no wait. Our server
was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks.

 Two of our friends had to have gluten-free food  and the restaurant was very 
accommodating. 

   I really want to do this place justice and hope this comes across in this review.

     First of all our server made us feel very welcome and answered all our questions about the menu, being it was our first time there.

   The drinks were well made and had a good kick to them. We also had a couple of the beers on tap that she suggested and they hit the mark.

    Now for the food folks.

      We had the cheese and meat platter( big board) which was great, Sesame Crusted Calamari wasabi honey, sweet chile, scallions, the burgers were made exactly as we asked for. The sweet potato fries were very tasty with the seasonings that were just right, the Amish chicken wings were flavored to perfection,the Ohio beef burger with the applewood bacon was excellent and medium rare as asked for, Pork BBQ local pork, black radish slaw, jalapeno hoe cake was excellent all in all the food came to us as it should.

   Bottom line: Food excellent, waitress excellent, drinks well made  friendly staff and a great crowd.

    Looking forward to our return.

   p.s. Tuesday tacos on our hit list.!!!!!!!

               Also they have specials that vary on certain days."}
{"text":"good food. good service. decent beer offerings. can be very loud. try the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"A must! Something for every foodie.
My husband said this is the best chicken and waffles of his life. He called the owner over to the table to praise the food.
They also have hearty vegan entrees for me.  We had the vegan chocolate-orange ice cream. The owner told us it's made I'm house...yummy!"}
{"text":"This place pretty much rocked my socks the first time I went in.  Customer service has remarkable every time we have visited. The drinks are great and the food is consistently delicious, unique, and very well priced. Highly recommend stopping in for brunch and ordering the house made donuts and grabbing a Bloody Mary at their self serve bar. Also, stop by for taco Tuesday and try their tacos in a lettuce wrap (special request)!"}
{"text":"Overall the place is just okay! A lot hype! I do like the fact they have some cool pairings but IMO, they would do better if they properly executed a small seasonal menu. And before I get slammed by that comment, I mean focus on a few things for that season and then change the menu. The daily menu changes isn't  great if you can't get it right!

The appetizer was bland (crispy chicken livers served over mascarpone creamy polenta with crispy onions) the livers didn't have much seasoning and the polenta was cold and bland-definitely not creamy. I grew up on chicken livers so I know how they should taste when they have seasoning. 

I ordered the crab mac & cheese which the waitress took back after she noticed I wasn't eating it. Where do I start with this meal? First, the cream sauce was bland didn't have distinct flavors (strike one), the crab (where was the crab? from the little bit of crab I could taste, it seemed fresh) the pasta shells were too big and overwhelmed the dish, probably to hide the lack of crab. What they lacked in crab they made up in green onions! The dish was full of green onions that they overpowered the dish and almost made me sick to my stomach. The salad was good (plus one).

The waitress was gracious and attentive so that helped. She offered me another meal and suggested I try the shrimp tacos. Another bummer! They were just okay, nothing to write home about. 

I also noticed a lot people had the calamari and I also noticed a lot of people had the calamari still on their plates. 

Maybe, it was a bad night but I don't see myself going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Had the baked goat cheese appetizer which was amazing, and for dinner had the Chicken Picatta special which was absolutely delicious. Great beer selection and diverse menu. Cool atmosphere. Not too pricey for the atmosphere and quality of food. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I have been to Deagan's several times since we became west siders and I don't think there is a bad thing on the menu! Whoever created Wednesday noodle night is a genius - I mean this is some of the best ramen I have had in Cleveland from a place that also has some of the best chicken and waffles! Plus $3 beers makes the boyfriend very happy during happy hour. Now that we discovered the noodles we might be back a lot more"}
{"text":"I like Deagan's - you can tell that the food is quality regardless of what you order and the atmosphere is cozy.  My only complaint is that it seems like they are always changing the menu."}
{"text":"We actually wanted to go to Melt. Wait was insane! We were hungry and cranky. COULD NOT have cared less at this point where we ate.. Luckily we walked into Deagan's, ordered burgers and fries -- couldn't have been happier! Atmosphere was nice, food was simple and delicious and for me ...... no allergic reactions ! That's a win for me!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   The ambiance is good, the food is even better, and it's reasonably priced.  If you enjoy beer, the also have a great draft selection.  I haven't tried their happy hour, but I have gone to their Sunday brunch numerous times.  I would highly recommend the chicken and waffles - the best I've ever had!  The friend chicken wasn't at all greasy and or dry, and the waffles were light and fluffy.   Yum!"}
{"text":"The good:  the house fries are to die for. Do yourself and your table a favor and order them. Was there on Saturday and there was a great vibe. Wait wasn't terrible. My husband had the steak and just raved about it. 
The bad (well not bad, just off): the service. These girls act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  Just an all around attitude.  It's sad that one person can sully a meal. The waitress at the table next to us was a doll so it's definitely not consistent issue. 

I had the burger and it was average.  This was our third meal here and overall not a bad experience."}
{"text":"All too often, I've read a review on Yelp of a place I love, and see tons of negative reviews, often with criticisms that deep down, I know are valid.  The best example for me is the Linden Tavern, which a lot of yelpers dislike for having slow service, uneven food, and a very mainstream beer selection.  All of those things are true, but I still love the place.  I've even caught myself telling somebody, \"oh, you tried the chicken Parm?  That's your mistake, it's terrible.\"

All of this has stuck in my mind since my girlfriend and I tried Deagan's a month or so back.  It's a solidly reviewed place, with some passionate fans.  Alas, our experience was somewhere between underwhelming and outright bad.  (I have since learned that they recently changed chefs, menus and prices, and many of the positive reviews, here and in person, referred to the prior regime.)

My girlfriend and I went to the Deagans on a Saturday afternoon, because I wanted good beer and she wanted bistro-food, so we compromised.  I was impressed with the decor and the ambiance.  I loved the exposed brick and the mural.  The large board showing the draft beers was a great touch.  Serious beer drinkers like a beer menu that is up to date and accurate, and I appreciate this.  I ordered two beers, and greatly enjoyed both.  My girlfriend ordered a Moscow Mule cocktail, and declared it amazing.  Unfortunately, this was in many ways the highlight of my visit.

For an appetizer I tried the chicken wings.   I'm a big fan of wings, and I really enjoy the possibilities of more interesting and delicate sauces.  The menu described the sauce as \"soy chile jam green onion,\" but in my opinion it was simply an upscale spicy barbecue.  While well done, for $8 for five wings I expected something more interesting.  My girlfriend ordered the fries, which I helped with.  These were undeniably great, especially when dipped in my wing sauce.  Cooked perfectly, with good dipping sauces, they were tastiest part of the meal.  Well, at least until my girlfriend found a pretty nasty hair on a fry.  

For my entree I got the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Bisque ($9)  Again, much like the wings, it was well done, but lacking in the interesting flavor I was expecting.  Compared to much of the menu, the portion size was good.  \"Bistro sized,\" in other words.  I enjoyed my meal but I would neither recommend it nor order it again.  My girlfriend got the Moroccan Lamb Stew which was as flavorful as I had hoped the rest of the menu was going to be.  Tender lamb, lots of spices without heat, and a pretty healthy portion made it probably the stand out of the day.

The service, in general, was fine.  We didn't want for anything, and everything came smoothly and without a delay.  Half way to the car, I realized we left the leftover stew on the table.  When I went back, I found the busboy cleaning the table.  I commented that I was too late, but he assured me that they kept her leftovers in the kitchen fridge.  That was a great touch on what had been a mildly disappointing day.  On the other hand, when we found the hair in the fries, and showed it to our server, she simply apologized.  She didn't bring over a manager, or offer to bring a new batch, or take them off the menu.  I mean, we didn't want more fries, and we ate all but the hairy one... but it was a little off putting.

None of this makes Deagan's bad, but when I got the check (around $65), I really felt let down.  Admittedly, we had drinks and appetizers, but I felt like I was paying way too much for the quantity and quality of what I received.  All in all, I give it two stars, for being disappointing, but certainly not terrible.  Part of me would like to try it again, in hopes of catching the place so many people clearly love, but not at those prices, unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have been to deagans at least a dozen times, and have always had fun.  Their beer list is comprehensive and probably the reason we keep coming back.  

The food is consistently good, though there are definite hits (the eggplant,-a favorite of mine, the matballs,  the salmon entree) and misses (the duck mac n cheese- it sounds good but just didn't deliver, the chicken livers- too much breading and funky after-taste)  I appreciate the effort to elevate bar food to a higher standard.  

The atmosphere is welcoming, and service is always extremely friendly.  Definitely a good place to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went with the family for Mother's Day Brunch. Brunch is not a buffet, but a set of breakfast/lunch/dinner menu options. I selected the a special waffle with a fruit sauce, pine nuts, and creme fraiche, I think the fruit sauce was key lime with tart cherries. There is a picture of on their Facebook page. Sounded really good. The only problem was the pine nuts were spoiled! The taste of rancid pine nuts overpowered all of the other flavors. I couldn't really pick them out because they were in the waffle crevices. I decided not to send it back because it took an hour to receive our meal in the first place and the waitress never asked how the meal was."}
{"text":"Just went to Deagan's for the first time in a while. It was our first date night out since having kids a couple years ago and I'm so happy we went there! Our server was fantastic and the food was great. We got the baked goat cheese, a special of the day ricotta gnocchi, and chicken wings (all small plates). The portions were great and we both left very full. The baked goat cheese was seriously amazing! My mouth is watering thinking about it again. I need to have it again. :)"}
{"text":"I commented on how slow the service was last August. We went last night on Taco Tuesday to meet up with friends. We were seated at 6:25pm. We left at 6:40pm after no one stopped by our table to take our drink order. Servers visited all 3 tables around us and no one seemed to notice or care. There's no excuse for servers not knowing their sections."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened tonight but it wasn't the deagans I've grown to love. Awful service and it took forever to get our food. I have a love for their spicy shrimp tacos and tonight they fell flat. Seriously two pieces of teeny tiny shrimp on a taco? Pathetic! If you have kids don't bother taking them here, they tried to fancy up their kids meals and kids don't like fancy things. Both of the kids hated their meals, stick with what kids now. Better luck next time Deagans."}
{"text":"We frequent Deagans due to their vegan friendly options.  Every Wednesday they have vegan dinner specials.  Taco Tuesday always includes at least 1 vegan taco selection, which is pretty good.  Even if you go on a different night when they don't have any advertised vegan specials, they have always been able to accommodate our request, and the chef will cook up a vegan special to order (usually a gnocchi dish with Brussels sprouts, micro greens, olive oil, etc- very tasty).

Our most recent trip was this past Wednesday for dinner on Vegan night.  We anxiously waited for them to post their daily specials on Facebook, and were excited by the variety of that evening's specials.  My wife and I started out with the vegan Winter squash bisque (w/ pumpkin, butternut squash, and red curry squash).  I was not a big fan.  It was too much pumpkin and cinnamon for my liking.  I felt like I was eating a holiday Yankee Candle.  My wife enjoyed it more than I did.  For our entrees, we ordered the Vegan Glass Noodle Bowl (w/ soba noodles, rice noodles, killbuck valley mushrooms, seitan, and hot & sour broth) and Vegan Crispy Unicorn Tacos (w/ seitan, local radish slaw, and sweet chilie gastrique).  Both were very good.  The noodle bowl was a nice take on a ramen dish, and the tacos (2 per entree) were very good.  I would have enjoyed some rice or beans as a side with the tacos, which were just served on a plate by themselves for $9.  We finished the dinner with an AMAZING Vegan Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie.  Tasted just as good, or better than any traditional pie.  

Overall, another good dinner.  The service was good as usual.  This is one of the more well rounded restaurants/gastropubs in Cleveland that offers great choices for all types of food lovers, including vegans.  We will be back, and hope they keep experimenting and expanding their vegan specials.  Hopefully they will turn some into permanent fixtures on the daily menu."}
{"text":"this place is all sorts of awesomeness!!!  

I had their amish chicken and waffles and the pork belly brussel sprouts as a side and both dishes were exceptional. i can't really say enough good things about this place. everything was reasonably priced. They were really busy but we never felt pressured to leave so they can turn the tables (we were a party of 11) over. In fact, we were there from 7:30 - 11:30 and everyone was able to enjoy a laid back night. 

i have become a fan and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Being a regular at Deagans, I have very few gripes with the place. Taco Tuesday is the bomb and the tacos change every week. On Thursday they have the burger special which again gets revamped every week keeping you guessing. They apply the same method to their beer selection which never ceases to impress. One criticism I would have would be the main menu, which was good the first time around but could use the creative spark they apply to their special menus. Regardless, this hasn't stopped me from going there on a weekly basis. And for that, I give Deagans five stars."}
{"text":"I have been to Deagan's twice now, both times for dinner.  

The first time I tried the Peach Tea drink, baked goat's cheese, pickled vegetables, and pretzel bread.  The pickled veggies are something you should split with a table, because the pickling is very strong and it's hard to eat that many pickled things.  The pretzel bread is good though not exciting.  The baked goat cheese was also good but the bread that came with it was so hard that I could barely eat it.  My Peach Tea drink tasted great but there was barely any alcohol in it, so I didn't get another one.

On my second visit, I had the Lamb Ragout and a French 75.  The drink was delicious.  Much better than the Peach Tea.  My meal was fairly good.  However, I expected a Ragout to be more saucey.  This dish was mostly dry--just a lot of ingredients tossed together.  The pea shoots were undercooked so it was hard to eat them.  The gnocchi and lamb were cooked well.

I think their menu items are interesting, but not exactly well-executed.  I will come back here again but if I don't find a dish that stands out soon, I will probably give up.

The decor is nice, bathrooms are clean, service pretty good.  It is really friggin cold inside when the AC is on (like most places) so bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Ugh... Why do I insist on believing that this once outstanding establishment could have learned a thing or two and gone back to its good ole days? Was just in last Friday and now, I really, really won't be back. How can you screw up guac and chips? Sullen, unhelpful bartenders, terrible service and awful food. It seems as though others in town are understanding the same as at 5 pm on the Friday before Labor Day the place was all but empty. You have such an awesome space, PLEASE do something about your servers and your food!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch early on a Saturday. The interior is large and comfortable. It has a natural wood/exposed HVAC ceiling decor. Our server was very attentive and brought water right away. I ordered a seasonal bourbon cocktail that was perfect; not too sweet and with enough booze to feel warm inside. 
For lunch, I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken is a boneless, skinless breast that was incredible. I was so surprised at the flavor given it was boneless.
My husband had the Ruben and said it was great. 
When we were leaving around 12:30, it was starting to fill up.  I would definitely recommend it and would like to try it for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Went last night for the vege night. Soup was very good, but BBQ tofu was just ok. Very friendly helpful service! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"With no exaggeration I will say Deagan's served me the best burger I've ever had. I can't even comment on anything else because the burger was so good."}
{"text":"Bartenders are generally great except for the new guy - he's a bit of an entitled hipster who isn't so concerned about keeping his customers happy. Food, as always, is solid, though the smoked salmon offerings are a bit off. Burgers, fries, and tacos are the way to go."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Deagan's for over a year and have always had a great experience. Tonight was no good. Apparently, they have a recent new chef. If you like mayonnaise, you are in good hands. I started with the chop salad. It was literally mixed greens, raw squash and shredded cheese tossed in mayo dressing. Gross. The waitress recommended the calamari as an appetizer. When it arrived, it was on a plate with the entire bottom slathered with mayonnaise and a big extra glob for dipping. The garnish - dried capers. Yuck. The bar service was great and I will return for drinks only. :("}
{"text":"The old Deagan's is back! I heard they changed chefs. For a while it seemed no one was there, even on the weekend. The quality was also lacking. Went out for taco Tuesday and loved the selection and price! If you are out on a Tuesday make sure to drop by!"}
{"text":"One of the best menus and staff I have ever witnessed. I love how well they take care of their customers and the food is to die for. You must must must get the Pommes Frites they are to die for. They have a really good happy hour and Taco Tuesdays which you have to check out! Don't forget brunch on Sunday :)"}
{"text":"Great tasty food. I have always enjoyed my food and the environment. Great drink/beer menu. Choose any food item on the menu and I'm sure your taste buds will be delighted."}
{"text":"Food is great but... waitress was extremely rude. To be fair, we had a large group but we did have a reservation so it isn't like we sprung it on them. Either the kitchen was backed up or something. 20 minutes from the first plate to the last service is pretty aweful."}
{"text":"So my wife and have been eating here since it opened and have loved it.   About a month ago we tried their Sunday brunch and we were blown away.  Shrimp and grits were awesome.  Went back today and it has gone to heck.  

Still had shrimp and grits...but now they serve the shrimp with the head attached and shells on.  So the shrimp is in the grits...and then you have to peel them...don't know how that's a good idea.  The taste of the dish wasn't nearly enough to compensate.  

Also had the breakfast pizza.  Described as pizza with egg, prosciutto and arugula.  What arrived was an 8 inch pizza crust with one tiny fried egg, a couple tiny strips of prosciutto, and very few arugula leaves.  Pretty weak showing.  

Lastly, we had the smoked salmon potatoe pancake.  Might have been the best thing we ate...but still wasn't very good.  Potato pancake was good, but had a pile of dry, flaky smoked salmon on it with some mayo-based stuff in between.  The 'hollandaise' sauce was literally just mayo.  

Apparently they recently hired a new chef, and from our experience they need to hire another one SOON!  Lakewood is full of competition for drinking spots, Deagans had a niche from its high end food...without that, they will struggle.  Love the old food, hope it gets straightened out."}
{"text":"Went to Deagans last night for the first time... must say that the portions are very small, a little pricey but delish!!  Just wish you get more for the money.  Might go again but not anytime soon an definitely wont pay $8 for lettuce with vinegar dressing again"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough positive things about this place! The food was absolutely fantastic! I went with a friend and shared the deviled eggs and calamari. Wow, those were so delicious. We then had the fried egg BLT with house fries which were also outstanding. The beer selection is huge and there is definitely something for everyone. Plus, the prices are very reasonable. This place is 5 stars hands down!"}
{"text":"I loved this place as a simple restraunt bar, was always impressed with the service, wine selection and innovative  specials. If I wrote this review a few months ago I would have given them 5 stars but after using their party room for a surprise party for my aunt with 50 people I would take back my 5 star rating and give them 10 stars!

Service was impeccable! Rachel was at our side during the whole process, from letting us personalize the space, picking the quantity and types of appetizers to helping us perfect the surprise when she walked in. 

Our waitress somehow managed to attend to the needs of all 50 of our guests and Rachel was always willing to help her out and take a drink order. We kept them busy but they appeared to never run out of energy to help us in any way we needed. 

The golden moment that showed us that they were willing to ensure we had a perfect experience was the fact that despite the bar being emptied out they allowed us to stay until the last possible moment they could serve us drinks. After 6 hours of serving us at each and every turn they were still willing to help us box up leftovers with a smile on their face. 

Every member of my family was highly impressed and in awe of such great personalized service we recieved. So whether you are looking for a delicious bite to eat with vast drink options or planning your next big celebration this would be not only mine but also the 15 + members of my family's  number one reccomendation."}
{"text":"An affordable farm-to-table place.  Excellent beer selection, top-quality and ingredients and a menu with variety and creativity.  I had an excellent plate of select dates.  It was dressed with $60-a-gallon maple syrup (relayed to me by our server).  The dates and the syrup were sublime (i didn't think maple syrup could be sublime, but it was, and I used to work in Vermont and had very good syrup) but it seemed strange to put them together, ultra-sweet on top of ultra-sweet.  The object and the dressing should complement each other, especially when they are so strong.

Raw oyster appetizer was very good.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We loved going to Deagan's when we first moved here. The brunch menu had a fantastic monte cristo, and awesome eggs benedict. Shortly after the menu kept changing - possibly the chef too? Each time, our server is unable to explain why the top-selling menu items are being nixed. Not sure why, but now going to Deagan's is disappointing, knowing how great it used to be. The menu has great potential, and looks pretty cool to out of towners, but it is poorly executed. We wont be going back to Deagan's for brunch or dinner until our favorite menu items are back. But if you're deadset on going - 1/2 bottles of wine on mondays. and the fries with shaved parm are always good."}
{"text":"Must say I was slightly confused when looking at the menu, but a helpful \"tender de bar\" was more then willing to explain. The fries were some of the best fries I had ever consumed. It also helped we went during Cleveland's Beer Week and got some good deals on some brew. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, they have a pretty nice beer selection as well. Overall, great environment and awesome interior. I grew up, up the street from the owner, very nice guy. Excellent work! 

Recommend."}
{"text":"truffle fries luke warm -  what's the point of the little bitty fry pieces 1 inch or less mostly- shrimp tacos over priced. shrimp was good though /  the taco part not. few tables filled yet had to holler down a waitress to order beverages -  go some place else !"}
{"text":"We came to Deagan's for one thing and one thing only. Tots. We left with good drinks in our bellies and a new bestie in Hallah. She immediately greeted us with a huge smile and warm, inviting personality. Although our demands were simple she exceeded all our expectations and helped us kick off #falltotstour with a bang. Black Velvet (Guinness and champagne was poured to perfection) and hells yes they have  Rhinegeist Bubbles. Tots were drizzled with the perfect amount of queso fresco and when dipped in the chorizo gravy, welp....or should I say, yelp.....tremendous tots. Crisp factor was also on point. #totstour #stillbetterthanred"}
{"text":"We read all the reviews and could not wait to give it a try...I guess this place is just not for us. I had the duck mac n cheese & moraccan meatballs, my husband had the ohio burger...everything was good but not good enough to make us want to go back...we just thought everything was just ok...not awesome..."}
{"text":"Taco tuesday is jaw droppingly amazing. Theyre menu has left a little left to be desired. However, super friendly staff and good booze selection. Moscow mule is pretty tasty and they put some mint in the drink. Its better than most. Moscow mule scale 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I'm not from Cleveland. I'm from Atlanta - so I was excited to come to a city that loves food, instead of the ATL which is the chain restaurant capital of America. 

Paul (biz friend here) took me to Deagan's. I'm mostly vegetarian-ish, with some fish now and again, but Paul didn't know that. 

This is an amazing and smart menu. The food is really good, clean and tasty, and no artifice or pretense. 

Specific praise for the cheese plates. I was transported to Bo Zinc Brasserie in the 15th eme where I lived in Paris for a while. Great cheese selection, paired with the right companions. If you haven't had St. Andre with honeycomb and cashews or walnuts, you have missed a perfect combination. The gruyere with the fig conserve.... My tiny complaint was the crackers, I so prefer thinly sliced baguette. 

The crisp eggplant, wrapped around ricotta cheese with the roasted tomatoes and the wonderful balance of sweet and acid and savory, the crunch with the soft warmth of the cheese. Fantastic. 

The hausgemacht vegetable pickles.... took me to the little inn near Badenweiler, fresh and real and vital. 

If you can't tell, it was a really good meal with many diverse tastes. The menu should satisfy almost any palate, and the prices aren't too high. Service was good and timely, and it was friendly but not so loud we couldn't talk. In short, this is the kind of place that would be a regular haunt for me. It's a place that a carnivore and a vegan can agree on."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. 
  
 For bar snacks we got the house fries, and the fried chicken skins. Best house fries I've ever had, the spicy mayo dipping sauce I could have eaten with a spoon. The fried chicken skins...well...I think the name says it all. I mean how can you go wrong?! 
   For our small plates we got the seared tuna poke, bison meatloaf, handmade pierogies, deviled eggs, quail, and figs. I wish I had taken a picture of the menu, because it changes so often I can't remember everything that was in each dish. But here we go. 
  First off, I didn't think you could improve on deviled eggs, I mean you've had one, you've  had them all right?  Wrong! They use goat cheese in these and they are seriously delicious. I had never had quail before this, and was pleasantly surprised. It was a little greasy, but I think I've heard that about quail. Whatever sauce they used underneath the quail, let's just say it took everything for me not to lick the plate clean. Tuna poke was good, strong on the sesame. The bison meatloaf was probably my least favorite of what we tried. It was a little dry, but the sea beans were really tasty. And the figs, oh my god. Just try them. I didn't even think I liked figs, but boy was I wrong. These melted in your mouth. 
  Just when we thought that nothing could be better than what we just ate, we ate something even better. This was the best food I've ever eaten in 32 years of life. 
   The service was lacking, but to be fair our waitress did tell us she had just fallen down the stairs."}
{"text":"On a sleepy Monday afternoon, I found myself in Lakewood for a business meeting.  We needed lunch, but we also needed a place that wasn't so loud that we had to shout over each other.  We strolled into Deagan's Kitchen and we were just so happy that there were plenty of guests, but it wasn't loud.  

Once we got the formalities out of the way, let's talk about food.  I am pretty sure our server said the chef cooking today was Greek.  She spouted a name which, if spelled, was nearly 25 letters long. The special was a lamb gyro.  I had to have it.  I was not disappointed.  If a Greek man couldn't put out a great gyro, no one could.  

This is a place not to be missed."}
{"text":"I think this place could be solid. They need to be less Applebees and more indy gastropub. The menu is decent but poorly executed in my opinion. The best thing it has going for it is a Debra Messing look alike server that makes you wonder if she made some poor financial decisions after Will and Grace."}
{"text":"Deagan's is wonderful and I really can't say enough good things about it. Service is always professional, food is always creative and interesting, and I love the playfully retro cocktails. If you go, take a few friends and grab a bunch of the small plates and apps to share. Everything is excellent, you won't be disappointed. Took my family and friends here for our Wedding Rehearsal Dinner back in October and all of our guests were raving about how great the food was. Some of the hilights were the deviled eggs, spiced nuts (seems deceptively unassuming but omg, wonderful!), fried mozzarella, chicken wings, calamari, even the fries are great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have dined in here twice and more recently ordered take away. 

Both times we dined in we had the fresh locally-sourced beet salad & enjoyed it so much. It has since been removed as an item menu, which is so disappointing. 

Our take-way was tasty! He ordered the steak and I ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese. We shared these meals. The steak was cooked to perfection & it has a couple sauces for the side. The lobster mashed potatoes were a little bland. The lobster mac and cheese had a small chuck of meat in it, but even still my boyfriend said it was the best mac he ever had. Besides a few misfires with the meal, we really enjoyed it and will go back.

We also ordered the mussels in the coconut broth. So savory!"}
{"text":"I am always down for a good Taco Tuesday, and Deagan's has some amazing tacos. I went here on the recommendation of a friend, and I was not disappointed. The menu rotates from week to week for the taco specials. When I got there, we were seated right away and our waitress was really nice and attentive throughout the meal. We sat at one of the high top tables by the bar. The menu of tacos was at least 8-10 deep - I got a pulled chicken, a Mediterranean fish, and a pot roast taco. They were all sooooooo good. No complaints except that they were way too filling, and I wish I had more room so I could have ordered more. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the regular menu."}
{"text":"Made it back to Deagan's on Friday for dinner with some friends.  LOVED my falafel sliders (12), and was particuarly impressed by the salad that came with them.  I also had the curried cauliflower side (8), which was serendipitous because the yogurt sauce from the cauliflower was awesome on the falafels.  Even my cheap, picky, burger-eating husband really liked his cider braised chicken and mashed potatoes (17).  The only suggestion I'd have is to indicate that the sides are meant for sharing because it was way too much cauliflower for one person."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Cool, rustic decor and open floor plan. Central bar with a few screens, but nothing that screams 'sports bar'. Casual environment. We were there on a Sunday, so the brunch menu was out. Party of 5. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. Cleveland Eggs Benedict, Breakfast Plate, Deviled Eggs, Goat Cheese. Good tap selection, wine list + Bloody Mary/Margarita specials. Prompt, friendly service."}
{"text":"OY VEY. Deagan's is an ever-changing review in my mind. Every time I go there, I have a different experience. Hardly any of it is consistent.

I'm not talking about the recent change of head chefs. I understand there's going to be a little bit of awkwardness as this happens. It's just that I never really know if I like this place or not. At first I did. Then I didn't. Now, I just don't know.

The service is ridiculously strange. VERY helpful and friendly, especially at the hostess stand, but then it's spotty at the table. We've had a variety of wait staff and some are excellent. Others are beyond horrible. Some are sort of clueless.

The food is another weird spot. I just don't like most of it. It's hard to pick what to eat because of all the stuff I DON'T want. And I don't want to keep ordering the Ohio Beef Burger again and again.

Yesterday we were there for brunch. New items and/or a reworking of old items on the menu. Sounds exciting. The food was actually much better than it had been. I had the chicken and waffles which was a VAST improvement over the last edition. However, the chicken (now a thigh, not a breast) went from overly dry and unflavorful to greasy and covered in skin and breading. Way too much breading to chicken. Plus, the chicken seemed a bit undercooked to me, and even though it probably was fine, I won't eat something that seems rubbery/pink in that way.

My husband got the fried egg BLT and was sooo excited about it, until it came without the egg. D'oh! He sent it back and waited over 30 minutes for its replacement. By that time, we were all finished eating. We requested it be comped, and the staff complied. I could chalk this up to a one-time occurrence, but this happened last time we were there for brunch too ( a couple months ago). I ordered the corned beef hash special and it came ... wait for it ... without the corned beef. Yep, it was a vegetarian hash with basically just peppers, onions, and potatoes. WTF?

The thing I like about Deagan's though is that they are very kid-friendly and that's what needs to happen in my dining-out experience these days. So we will likely keep returning even though I am 80% unhappy with my meals there."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see that the brunch menu has been re-created. The last time I ate brunch here was over a year ago and there were only a handful of selections. This time they had a full menu of options. I really enjoyed the Ricotta Fritters and the 'Nudja Grilled Cheese. Both were tasty and their menu doesn't break the bank. The dinner menu and taco menu also seem like they have had a few changes for the better."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday, early evening. Ordered tomato bisque off the specials menu. It was outstanding!

For dinner, not being too hungry, I had the calamari I saw on here.  It was wonderful! It had a nice twang and want chewy at all. 

Daughter had a Caesar salad and tofu curie. Both dishes were good.  She also had a Pepermintini off the holiday drink menu. It was also very good. I had a taste and I'm here to tell you, I could drink a lot of those!  

For dessert, we had an Andes Mint cheesecake and spiced eggnog. Both were outstanding!  

Service was fair, food terrific. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Saturday night. We were seated right away, not many people were there. We ordered a delicious goat cheese and squash purée dip that we loved so much we recreated it at home the next day! Ordered the veggie burger sliders that were just okay but stole bites of the cheeseburger from my mother. Holy cow, definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had plus it was massive! They had a lot of craft beer as well, always a plus."}
{"text":"Deagan's was such a great addition to the local food scene as soon as they opened their doors. They truly were a Gastro-Pub; a place serving great food and a strong beer list to wash it down with.  I have found the food to be good, but feel like the last few visits the dishes coming from the promising kitchen are uneven- like something is missing from time-to-time.  The shrimp tacos are great, but the last few visits the shrimp was camouflaged by an excessive amount of cilantro- now I love me some fresh cilantro, but this is overkill.  The DK Burger is very good, but sometimes the bun just seems to fall apart.  I really liked Deagan's when they opened and I want to try them again, but something tells me I could leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Look... We love this place... The 30$ meat and cheese board is sooo not worth it. Love the atmosphere ... Very friendly staff... Great drink selection... Love the whoopie pie!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place pretty well.  The draft beer selection was amazing; not just in quantity but also in quality.  The mac and cheese confit was also pretty solid.  Prices were very reasonable.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm writing my update with bad news. While my second time here was pretty delicious, I can't negate the fact that my third time was identical to the first and therefore really disappointing.

My second visit was great! I had the fish and chips and it was super tasty. The fish was tender and the breading was perfect and crispy. My third visit, though, was a crap shoot for me. I knew I wanted a burger and I knew I wanted to give Deagan's another chance. So I went for it. The day the burger scorched my poor finger that went through the soggy bottom bun was about to be relived. My fries were good, though a little oversalted, but I can't really be mad about that. I freaking love salt. Back to the burger. Gah. So sad.

\"The grease had soaked completely into the bottom bun; my finger went through it entirely, straight to the burger immediately. It was like I was eating leftovers before they even got to become leftovers. The bun was brown and dripping with grease! I guess it was good, but not something I would expect from a place like this.\" (Also, the meat was a little overcooked, but still pretty delicious. I just have a texture and taste issue with a soggy nasty bun.)

Same as the last burger I had here. I think I learned my lesson.  I'll be going for the fish and chips next time and keeping it that way. 

Also worth noting is how loud it gets here. We were here for a late dinner on a Thursday and it was roaring. Luckily, we sat in the back on the mini-stage-like area, so we were slightly secluded and could hear each other."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were in the area and were hungry.  The wait at Melt was, as usual, way too long, so we decided to go to Deagan's instead.  Now, I like food.  Hell, I didn't get in the shape I'm in by NOT liking food.  However, I have to admit, I found the menu quite intimidating.  I'm not a foodie by any stretch of the imagination.  To me, the simpler, the better.  

I was happy to see they had Oberon on draft.  I'm a Michigander at heart, and whenever I see Bell's, I get all warm and fuzzy inside.  I decided to go with what appeared to be the most simple thing on the menu, which was the chicken and waffles.  Now, I know this AIN'T no soul food joint, but this stuff was sooooooo good!  Two huge chicken breasts, covered in powdered sugar, with a gigantic waffle, and berry syrup on the side.  I could have done without the full berries, as I'm not a berry person, but it was still quite delish.

The ambiance was a little TOO trendy for me  But that's just me.  I hate pretentiousness, and I just found it to be a little too much for me.  However, all in all, food was good, service was good, beer was good, and it was a good time.  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went on a recent Taco Tuesday night and had another wonderful meal at this Gastropub spot in Lakewood.

Their taco fillings and specials were all top notch with a nice selection of meat, fish, and veggie options.  The side of beans and rice had a bit more of a Latin flavor than Mexican, but they were extremely tasty as well.

Have also had the charcuterie plate in the past and loved the selections those provided.

A bit loud (as the space is wide open), but other than that it's hard to complain about the food quality this spot is putting out."}
{"text":"Morgan was such a lovely server! She even entertained my boyfriends silly questions about what hot sauce they used as a base for the fish and grits entree!! My 
Manhattan was on point! And my winter Manhattan was pretty tasty as well. Love the seasonal special cocktails! I had the hangar steak for dinner and it was cooked to perfection! The sweet potato hash was slightly undercooked but I think that was on purpose. The crunch was kind of a pleasant experience paired with the soft gold potatoes and roasted leeks and rhubarb (I think). 

Since we work service industry. We got half off our cocktails which is soooooo worth the visit!! Just bring in a paystub and they put you in some sort of registry. Just show them an updated stub every 6 months! 

We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary tasting food. 

Short rib nachos were tasty but there was almost no short rib or sauce and the nachos were potato chips. 

Chicken and waffles were perfectly passable with a crispy chicken and nothing special about the waffle but the \"bean salad\" was lacking. 

The lobster Mac and cheese was truly awful.  Over cooked mushy pasta with some bread crumbs and a claw.  If Applebee's had lobster Mac and cheese it would be this.  

Overall, no reason to go here."}
{"text":"A new Lakewood classic! Our town is big on supporting local businesses, so it's no surprise that an innovative, beautiful, and delicious establishment like Deagan's is thriving. I love the ambiance of the place; the exposed brick walls give it an urban vibe and I've never had a bad seat in the place, from the long tables to the spacious booths to the intimate spaces around the corner.

There are too many wonderful things to say about this place. They won me over with their classic cocktail menu, which was recently expanded. They make a darn good Moscow Mule, and a solid Old Fashioned. Try the new additions as well, with more exotic spirits like absinthe and St. Germain.

I should mention that Deagan's is great for groups, too. We've been there on several occasions with large groups (10+) and the staff was always accommodating and friendly, even as people kept adding on to our party throughout the night.

The food can get pricey if you're drinking too, so we often go just for drinks and dessert or just food. Their dessert specials never fail to impress, from an unbelievable vegan chocolate cake to stuffed figs to pie topped with Maker's Mark ice cream.

However, if you want to eat, you'll find lots of tempting choices. The pecking duck confit mac and cheese is super rich, and you'll feel luxurious ordering it and eating it. According to friends, it is easily several meals in itself, since the sauce is so creamy, but it reheats well. This is a decadent choice, but you won't regret it. Same thing with the lobster mac.

Another classic is the chicken and waffles with cayenne butter and blackberry maple syrup. A winner at any time of day.

Even the new brunch menu is perfectly executed, with many of the favorites popping up (like those mentioned above), and tons of a la carte options such as freshly made doughnuts and grits and fried eggs. Add a make your own bloody mary bar and fresh mimosas and you have a formidable Sunday morning selection.

Just try it! This place is versatile; it works as the neighborhood bar, the fancy date night dessert spot, the celebratory meal location, or a Sunday brunch place you can take your mother to while she's in town."}
{"text":"This place is a little more spendy that my typical eatery.
I was visiting my Yelp bestie and his family for the weekend,
so I had the benefit of having a sugar daddy pay for my meal.
If I had to pay for my meal,
I would probably be a little more bummed about this place.
I would recommend it for a nice date night,
or a night when you can splurge a little bit.

The restaurant is nice looking,
we got there as the families were wrapping up eating,
so the lights were still on full blast.
As our meal was underway, 
the lights dimmed and our corneas relaxed.
There is some bike mounted on the wall, for whatever reason.
I saw some lady grab onto the bike and start messing with it.
The bike didn't look all that secure, 
so I thought I would watch her for awhile, as I sipped my beer.
\"This should be entertaining\" I thought....
then, in horror, I noticed the baby she had in her arms.
Dear lord, people, don't grab onto rickety wall decor
that could come crashing down on your baby's head.

I ordered the fish and chips.
The fish was really tasty!
They were battered and fried to a nice crisp.
The fish was moist and tasted fresh.
The fries were good, standard.
The tartar sauce was a good compliment.
I split a lemon bar with my sugar mamma.
It was really yummy, but became too rich after the 4th bite.

I was really impressed with the large selection 
they had for vegetarians.
I don't have the willpower to swear off meat,
but seeing menu options like the ones presented here
almost makes me think I could pull off the dietary switch for a day."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. So all in all I'm a fan.  Good food and drink selection.  I would recommend the Chicken and Waffles (really good), House Fries, Spicy Shrimp Tacos, and Baked Goat Cheese.

Do not make the mistake we made and spring for the $30 \"BIG\" charcuterie board.  It's enough for 2 maybe 3 people and it was good but not $30 great.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"This is one restaurant in Lakewood I will go back to many times. At first I wasn't a fan of the smaller menu and just got a burger, which was delicious. The next time I went I was in a larger group and we decided to order a variety. The lobster Mac and cheese was amazing. Taco Tuesdays are great and cheap. I have always disliked Brussel sprouts however they made theirs with bacon, blue cheese and nuts. We still talk about that dish and tell everyone to get it."}
{"text":"I adore this place.

As a Lakewood native, recently returned home for good, I am rediscovering the Lakewood food scene. It's a pleasurable task, to say the least.

Deagan's is awesome. I've been here multiple times, with great results each time. The atmosphere is fun and perfect mismatched kitchen. It can get a little loud later at night, but it's not unpleasant. The beer and cocktail list is daunting in a good way. I have a hard time not liking a place serving vintage cocktails

The food is just so much fun.  Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad is a solid choice and the Duck Confit Mac & Cheese is luxurious. The entire menu is great. Definitely try the cheese boards.

If the timing is convenient.....you must get to Taco Tuesday. Alas, I missed out on the special shrimp taco last week. However, the Ahi Tuna is something great.

Perfect easy, breezy place for the summer! If you haven't tried it, you definitely should."}
{"text":"Love this place. Consistent alway. Every time I go there is something new to the menu. And they also always make sure to have the deviled eggs available. This time they added shaved Brussell sprouts which were amazing.  Also try the drunken goat cheese. So good. Highly recommend. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went there for lunch I had the haddock sandwich special it was tasty and a little spicy I accompanied it with the Lavender Collins yummyyy I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"This was a fun place! I went in a group of 3 and we ordered 1 app and 2 entrees and shared. It was PLENTY of food, I think we even had some left over. I LOVED the music here!
Unfortunately, I had a work physical the next day so I couldn't partake in their fun alcoholic specials, but they looked great. We will be going back so that I can try them!"}
{"text":"After hearing about Deagan's constantly from both a coworker and my roommate, I finally made a point to go one night.  And by \"made a point,\" I mean \"my friend and I were hungry to the point of pick-any-place-and-go.\"  You know the drill. 

Seeing a full restaurant for their Wednesday night vegan night, we sat at the two empty places at the bar.   As hungry as we were, we ordered the sweet potato fries before drinks - and they amazingly came at the same time.  While devouring the fries (which were the perfect balance of size to cooked to uncooked/mushy ratio so that you got crunchy fry while the succulent sweet potato still shined - DELISH), we played Trivial Pursuit and chatted with the neighboring patrons.  The trivia cards reside at the bar, btw. 

By the time we were finishing the fries, our food came out.  After being spoiled by the fantastic sweet potato fries, my vegan flatbread was a little less to be desired, but still quite tasty!  The friend's salad looked uh-mazing though, which she reported as an accurate assessment.  

And after all the eating, the lovely patrons got us another round of drinks for chatting and watching their phone.  Hard work pays off, folks! 

In total, I loved Deagan's.  And while I may have been desperate for anything on the night of my first visit, I made a strong point to go again less than a week later.  Yes, it's just that good."}
{"text":"One word:  Shandygaff!  It is a beer cocktail featuring Bell's Oberon and Ginger beer.  Yummy!  Deagan's is a true gastropub.  Exposed brick walls and upscale bar food.  The sweet potato fries were awesome.  True slices of sweet potato (not pre-cut) and sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar and brown sugar.  They were served with a side of honey mustard.  We weren't that hungry so we didn't venture to eat anything else but from looking around, the chicken and waffles and cheese/meat boards were a popular item with fellow diners.  We are big fans of Tremont Tap House and I'd say Deagan's is a close runner-up to it.  Where Deagan's is different than Tremont Tap House is its wine and spirits menu.  And Deagan's attracts a much broader audience (saw lots of 45+ men and women).  We look forward to trying more of the Big D's food..."}
{"text":"I went to Deagan's after seeing it on the Cleveland Magazine top 100 restaurants list. Which has kind of become like a bucket list, or a contest to try as many as possible. Also I had passed it several times as it is near to my home. It certainly did not disappoint. I started off with a Moscow Mule service properly in the tradition copper mug. I was impressed! It was perfectly chilled and very tasty. Moved on to the shrimp tacos for an ap. Tender shrimp in a slightly spicy sauce on a soft warm tortilla. So good! I crave these things constantly now. I got the mac and cheese entree to go. While I found it to be a disappointingly small portion it was still very tasty. Smoked gouda with chunks of chicken and bacon. If only I had more of it! I revisited after this strip for more delicious tacos and cocktails. The food is great, it is very clean, and the bar staff is friendly and knowledgable. GO!"}
{"text":"Every thing right about locally owned business and another score for Lakewood.

Deagan's room is awesome, they have kept every cool historic aspect of the room, while updating it and restoring the place to its current glory.

Perfect selection of craft beers and comfort food; cannot wait to come back and visit Deagans in the winter.  

I enjoyed a Short Rib sandwich and Caprese salad (the ingredients were garden fresh).  Great place for a date, family meal, or guys night out."}
{"text":"As always, you may disagree with my opinion and I think I need to give Deagan's another chance, but I was disappointed with my experience. I was not feeling the carnivore thing the night we went and they had some good-looking vegetarian items.

I ordered the veg sliders and the waitress asked if I was vegetarian or vegan, which was probably very nice so she could offer suggestions, but I didn't question her motives.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the sliders. They were extremely dry and tasteless. I am no expert on vegetarian cooking, but I am sure there's a way to do chickpea paste that doesn't turn out this way. That said, my wife seemed to thoroughly enjoy her taco special (we were there on a Tuesday), but she's not writing the review, I am. The fries were good, but really how bad can fries get?

The waitstaff were friendly and seemed helpful, though the service was a little slow and it was difficult to locate our server at times. The place was not packed and we didn't have to wait for a table, so I am not sure why things were slowed down. This is all forgivable if the food has been outstanding, but it was not.

I have already written reviews of other places in Lakewood that I like better, I didn't feel as \"at home\" at Deagan's as at other places. Like I said, I will probably give them another shot and order something different, but based on my experience it's not going to leap to my mind when I think of beer and pub noms."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The food is remarkable and am making it a point to make my way through their menu.

Both times I've been here, I haven't been able to get enough! Wish the potions were a tad bigger since the food is so enjoyable.

Chicken and Waffles: 10/10 would recommend
Shrimp Tacos: 10/10 would recommend
Short Rib Sandwich: 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Holy Brunch.

Highlights: 
Mandy the bartender-, kind, but not cloying; attentive, but didn't hover; had great suggestions, but not pushy

Drinks- bloody mary bar. hands down the best I've had. 3 types of base (tomato juice, clamato and house made mix), one trillion different hot sauces, and a plethora of house-pickled veg. so, so good. my buddy had a stout that he loved. Mandy made the greatest Colorado Bulldog ever- vanilla vodka, yum!

Atmosphere- it was a super bizarre mix of post Palm Sunday church goers and young, beautiful urbanites looking for a mid-day buzz. It shouldn't work, but it does. The building is beautiful. Big, but cozy, with exposed brick, tin ceilings and a lovely, massive bar.

Food- fully in my top 5 for Cleveland. 
We were there for brunch but they kindly agreed to let us order the oysters off the dinner menu for our appetizer. They came on a bed of wakame with a horseradish heavy (that's a compliment) cocktail sauce and a mango sorbet. Say what? Yep, a mango sorbet. It's weird to read and see. It's wonderful to taste. Just trust me.

He: chicken and waffles with blackberry maple syrup. I barely got to taste this because he got down on it. The cayennebutter is whipped to a light, airy bit of wonder, the chicken was cooked well and despite being a boneless breast was still m-word (m**st, i hate that word) and the waffle is lovely. With a little sriracha this may be one of the greatest gifts you'll ever give your taste buds. My buddy ranked it as his favorite chicken and waffles of all time.

Me: the cuban. oh dear. I'm not much for sandwiches, they just really aren't my bag, but this, this transcended sandwich. The bread was lovely, chewy and toothsome but not heavy or dry; the locally sourced hams (plural intentional) were out-stand-ing, I mean to preach. I'm pretty sure that was a house pickle on there. Oh, it was unbelievable. I was only going to eat half. I ate every last bit. (except for the bite I begrudgingly let my buddy have). Served w/ house made chips that were fantastic. Sliced super thin, fried perfectly and lightly seasoned. Really a wonderful plate.

Dessert: we were full, but we are also fat kids so we (I) ordered the chocolate bar. picture a Take 5 - ice cream bar version- with a slice of bacon under the pretzel segregating the layer of peanut butter they added. The plate is littered with fresh berries, whipped cream (real) and caramel sauce. Oh, and some more bacon. It was rich, decadent, over the top and amazing in every way. 

Music- it was like the best of the 60s Pandora station. it was quiet, almost too quiet, loud enough so you knew what was playing, but not so loud that it interfered with your conversation.

We had an exceptional time and will certainly be back to Deagan's."}
{"text":"Caught up with a new content marketing/social media contact yesterday. We actually met here in March during the tweetup with Cleveland.com, DSN and the Indians, and he was also at the meetup at Hyland Software last week. 

Killer selection of microbrews, wine and vintage cocktails. As I've mentioned in other reviews, I have a soft spot for deconstructed, minimalist and organic, slow-grown products. 

I've also had an ongoing love affair with Chilean wine lately, mainly malbecs. They carry one of my favorite pinots, Llai Llai, which I actually went with last time. 

I decided to go for the sauvignon blanc this time (mentioned in the 806 Martini/Wine review), called La Capostolle.
It was okay (still prefer German rieslings), and paired well with the YellowFin Tuna Nicoise salad, which was listed as grilled on the menu. Chagrined, I asked if they could serve it Ahi rare (sashimi, sushi, carpaccio, tartare geek), and was pleasantly surprised when the server made a point of asking and finding out they could. 
Compliments to executive chef Demetrios Atheneos and sous chef Lee Robinson. 

Everything was farm-fresh, immaculate: local egg, potato, french beans, grape potatoes and kalamata olives. Nom nom. 

Tony went with the Reuben, and in retrospect I should have taken him up on the offer to try a piece. Love brisket, rye bread -- and this one had the whole shebang: montreal-style brisket, gruyere, kraut, marble rye and chips. Perhaps persnickety, but if I'd gotten it I might have asked if they carry dill spears as well lol. 

All washed down the Old Fashioned way: Makers Mark bourbon, bitters, sugar, water, maraschino cherry and orange -- impeccably mixed.
Next time I wanna try the Moscow Mule: russian standard, ginger beer, sugar syrup, lime juice, mint and lime. 

First-rate menu, service, conversation and company."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love taco tuesdays. I love the service, bartenders are always mindful ( could be that i tip well every week). Fantastic food, great mixed drinks and endless beer selection! Atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite build-your-own Bloody Mary spots, and a great place to come for some delicious brunch.

Deagan's has a lot of seating, which makes it a rare find in our area of very small brunch spots. Come between 10-11am and you're guaranteed a spot. All dishes here are served with excellent presentation and brunch entrees typically have some kind of creative twist. The Cleveland Benedict, for example, is eggs Benedict over two fresh potato pirogies. It's all filling and delicious!! 

If you come for brunch, plan on doing the Bloody Mary bar, which comes with a huge selection of house-pickled garnishes, hot sauces, cheese stuffed olives and more. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Hosted s shower here. The room was great. Staff was so helpful. Food was great and the whole party was served in a decent amount of time. They set up the room just the way I asked."}
{"text":"Deagan's Kitchen has singlehandedly raised the bar for Gastropubs.

As a taco connoisseur, I opted to go for Taco Tuesday. Beef or Chicken tacos are $2, and Shrimp or Ahi Tuna tacos are $3. Since I love seafood tacos, I opted for 1 each of Shrimp and Ahi Tuna. The Shrimp taco came with white cheddar, guacamole and micro cilantro, while the Ahi Tuna came with soy chili glaze, Asian slaw and guacamole. Now, I've had a lot of fish/seafood tacos in my day, but I can say with confidence that these are among the best I've ever eaten.

For the main course, I had the Peking Duck Confit Mac & Cheese, which was absolutely, positively delicious. Served with shallots, Mahon cheese and English peas, it's full of meaty, cheesy deliciousness; comfort food raised to another level.

Both the menu and beer list are impressive, and it's obvious that both were created with a lot of thought and care. Also unexpected was the very good Charcuterie selection, something I wouldn't expect to see here, which is very refreshing.

The service was very friendly and prompt, and Deagan himself even came by our table for a visit.

Everything is priced very reasonably, considering the quality of ingredients and quality of the food itself.

I will definitely become a regular here. Lakewood should be proud to have Deagan's."}
{"text":"The menu is limited, the portions are small, the service is slow, the food is average and the prices are high. I went here with a friend for dinner and drinks and neither of us were satisfied. I ordered the mac and cheese gratin that is supposed to come with pulled chicken and bacon. Yet, when it came out it was so tiny and the cheese on top was already very hard and cold. There was NO chicken and very little bacon. The salad it came with was very average and not dressed enough. He got the burger and although it was overdone, the fries it came with were pretty tasty. We got the baked goat cheese as an appetizer which was mostly just marinara sauce. The tiny dollop of goat cheese was barely shareable which was frustrating even though it was just an appetizer. The redeeming quality of this place is that they have a pretty long list of beers on tap. If I ever go back it will definitely just be for drinks."}
{"text":"Good truffle fries 
Mac and cheese was the bomb
Lamb burger was ok
Service was awesome
Relaxed and cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"Oh my, do they have any bad food?  I have yet to find it.  The chef keeps the menu fresh with daily specials for lunch and dinner.  The staff is great and accommodating.
Tuesday night is taco night, with one special taco created each week.  This is worth a visit.  Make sure to try the Spicy Shrimp taco!
Wednesday is Vegan/Veggie night.
Don't miss the fries with shaved parm, truffle oil, and sea salt.
They have a great beer selection, which highlights a lot of seasonals."}
{"text":"Incredible beer selection. Enjoyed my tator tots with the chirozo sauce. Beef short rib with the perogis was fantastic. Tryed the chicken and waffle with the pure maple syrup. Everything tasted great together. Loved the music selections. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Just remembered why I don't visit here more often... The menu is really lame, 1 burger and and Veg burger option in the entire sandwich dept.  Kind of a waste of a great atmosphere and warm interior. I wouldn't come here unless it were Taco Tuesday or grabbing a drink.  The deviled eggs with goat cheese and English mustard are worth sampling."}
{"text":"OK first thing is first.  Is it \"ok\" to say OK or should you say okay. Really pumped up to hear about this place being fun. So I came here with a great aspirations. Anywho, the service literally smelled like crab kake . My waiter had dumbly hands, which isn't a great combo with an Irish coffee, get it? Anywho, (I know I've already used this word but u like it so I'm gonna use it twice. Plain and simple, the place is overpriced. I didn't eat there. Take that for what it is."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I give it 4-5 stars for the beer list, but maybe a 3 star for the food, which can be inconsistant. Biggest problem I've had with the food was eating mussels with a load of sand in the bowl. That wasn't good. I have had some good stuff here though; it's not all bad. Plus the service is mostly good."}
{"text":"I was truly excited about having some tacos from this place and when I read the menu I was even more excited to try the Milkbutter Chicken Skins. Saying this the waitress was just \"blah\" and seemed super annoyed by us just being there. Mind you it was myself and my lady. The food order was wrong and what was right was gross. I will never be back. Super disappointed in the whole thing."}
{"text":"Alright, this place is really cool but I cannot recommend something this expensive on a regular basis. The food is just not worth the price tag, in my opinion. It's a cool place with a unique menu but it's just not awesome enough to keep me coming back on a regular basis. 

HOWEVER, they have good specials during the week. Taco night is awesome. $2 tacos and they're really, really good. I also really like the way this place looks, the staff is nice, and the drink selection is decent. I just don't recommend going on a Friday night for dinner. Go on a Tuesday and get some yummy tacos!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their happy hour specials.  I especially liked when they had tacos with curried chicken.  Not sure if that was a regular item though.  
I enjoy that they have good food, not bar food.  I also enjoy that it's also a nice bar space.  Ample room to move around.  

Tip: The party I was with raved about the chicken and waffles.  They were good, but the waffle was soggy, I would suggest asking for the chicken not to be placed on top so it would sogg up the waffle."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The staff is a delight and the food options are creative. If your looking for tasty food & delicious drinks this is your place!"}
{"text":"Came in last night (3/23/13) for the first time because we walked by randomly and I LOVED it! A total whim but a GREAT one!

Great food, staff, and atmosphere! I will be back with more friends & family! 

Oh and I had the Mac & Cheese- ammmmazing! Glad it was so large so I can enjoy the leftovers this week too! We also had the Baked Goat Cheese, it was great! Our server even had more crostini brought out to us! My friend had the chicken and waffles, which I had to try too, and they were great as well!"}
{"text":"I expected a lot from this place since it was talked up so much by the people I went with. Unfortunately, it fell really short. 

Our server didn't seem to know how to handle a party of our size (we had 10 + a baby). She was slow to check on us, every order came out one by one and even when our food came out...2 people had to wait another almost 10 minutes for their food! 

My eggs and my boyfriends eggs were very overcooked (we asked for over easy and they came out hard). When we brought it to the attention of our server she didn't really seem to know what to do. We had to order a side of eggs instead of her offering.

We ordered a bunch of desserts, one of which had a LONG hair in it. 

Given all of the other places that are in the area, I will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Great food and drink and a fun place to hang out. Had my wife's birthday there and it was great, highly recommend booking a large party there you won't be dissapointed"}
{"text":"A great, affordable, hip neighborhood restaurant. The servers here are friendly and fun (although not generally fully attentive) and the menu innovative with local flavors.  Once you make a visit you'll be back.  My personal fav entree is the chicken and waffles with chilpotle butter + blackberry maple syrup.  I promise if you order this your dining companions might lose a hand if they try to steal a taste.  Just speaking from experience. :-)   

Also, they have great starters -- the cheese and bread board is great to share but for me the deviled eggs with goat cheese are the best ever (I could seriously eat a half dozen!).   Fabulous, fresh, interesting salads too. 

They have awesome veggie menu options,too!  The veggie sliders are great and on Wed night they feature several vegetarian featured entrees.  Tuesdays are taco night which my friends say is a night to mark on your calendar -- it will be my next visit.  Several gourmet taco options so mix and match a plateful and add a margarita or choose a beer from their great selection.

I have dined here lots of times and although it is a fav go-to place for me I'll give you the full scoop on the thing that is not as Yay! Yay, Deagan's.   It seems that about every other time we dine here there seem to be issues with some of the food prep not being of the high caliber they normally serve.  Mostly this has been an issue for late lunches but it has occurred at dinnertime as well.  We've not been able to figure out the how and why but just heads up!

 I do frequent Deagan's and we love having it in the neighborhood. See you there!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They always have a great rotating craft beer selection. In the past they had vegan nights. It introduced us to an incredible mac and cheese there! We've thrown every major party/event here. From our friends non-profit fundraiser, to our going away party, coming home party, birthdays.... it's just a great place. There's something on the menu for everyone food wise and drink wise. Beer, wine, fancy drinks. And it's a chill vibe. The servers and bartenders have always been wonderful to us too. Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Day at Deagan's! My friend and I sat at the bar and indulged in the Spicy Chicken and Waffles. It's served with fried Brussel sprouts, an egg, and chorizo gravy. I have an egg thing - scrambled, omelette or quiche only. They had no problem subbing a scrambled for me. The brussel sprouts were yummy but a bit too salty. However the chicken was some of the best I've ever had. The waffle was tender and sweet (not sure but I believe it was either a pumpkin or sweet potato base). The gravy brought it all together beautifully. 
They have a mimosa and Bloody Mary bar, but I was trying to be good (LOL) and ordered a vodka soda with \"a butt load of limes\". As you can see, they completely accommodated me. Between my cocktail and a glass of H2O, I used every one.
Interested to go back and try more dishes, maybe something a bit healthier next time. 
Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This place is decent but I probably won't be returning. I got the shrimp tacos and they were ok. I also remember it being very dark in the restaurant and the atmosphere being weird."}
{"text":"This place is difficult to review.  I've been 3 times total over the last year, twice in the last month for brunch. The first time was OK, the second time was great and the third time was awful. 

 A group of 6 of us went a month ago on a Sunday during a snow storm and everything was excellent.  I had the Cleveland Benedict and my girlfriend had the Biscuits and gravy. Both were very good.  This past Sunday we had a party of 7 and went at 11:30.  The wait was approximately 20-30 minutes (understandable for a larger group). We were sat and ordered drinks.  After ordering drinks the waitress disappeared for about 15 minutes before taking our order.  Once we ordered it took approximately 45 minutes for our food to come out.  In that time several tables that were sat 5-10 minutes after us got there food and finished eating.  Once the food came out at least 5 of our meals were sub-par and everyone's was cold or room temperature at best.  The burger (ordered medium) was raw, the biscuits in the biscuits and gravy were very tough and the gravy was cold.  The DKB breakfast eggs had congealed and the apple butter was watery.  Out of the 7 of us, the French Toast was the only decent meal.  You could tell the dishes sat for a long time without being brought out.  The deviled eggs were good but $3 for an egg is a bit steep and $5 for a side of average bacon is crazy.  The burger was taken off the bill but we didn't complain about the rest of our meals because the waitress didn't check on our meals until we were finished. We split bills by couples and even those were messed up and needed re-done.  By the time we left it was nearly 2:00pm, ridiculous for a brunch with friends.  With so many new brunch places coming online around to Cleveland I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been here a few times, and have never had to wait for a table. 

Their veggie burger sliders are my absolute favorite. Chickpea burgers with caramelized onions and spicy mayo are just perfect. Once they were a bit dry, and our waitress was more than happy to bring us an extra cup of the mayo. It really made the burgers. The pomme frites are delicious as well. They're topped with truffle oil, romano and I think spring onions. Perfectly crispy, and oh so delicious with the extra spicy mayo.

The crispy eggplant is good also, but just a tad bit oily for my tastes. I have also had the key lime crepes during brunch. They're two cigar-like crepes with a key lime filling and delicious marinated cherries on top. The sweet and sour flavors were perfectly balanced, and the plump cherries were delectable. Sweet but not too overpowering!

I've heard they have a vegan/vegetarian night as well. I have never heard of any restaurant doing something like this, so I definitely want to check it out!"}
{"text":"Deagan's has long been a Lakewood staple of date nights and meals with friends in my household. We love that their menu offers a little something for everyone (including my vegetarian husband), without being overbearing in size. We also love that it gets seasonal updates, but has a few standards we can always rely on. Their specials menu and drink menu is also always on point. 

I also recently discovered their magical happy hour and it has become a new favorite to grab a $3 draft (from their great selection) and a snack. The vibe is low key, and it makes for the perfect place to unwind after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I went from 4 stars to 3 after thinking about it for a while. If I could give 3.5 stars I would. I like you Deagan's...but I just don't love you yet. This was maybe the 4/5 time I've been in.... tonight was a really nice experience. The service was pleasant, prompt and consistent. I didn't realize it was 1/2 price wine bottle night, which is THE BEST DEAL. Seriously, I love it! I will definitely be back to enjoy this again. Their wine list is not extensive, they hold mostly low end bottles, but the wines I tried were nice. 

I had the calamari. It was good and crispy, but not physically hot. It felt as though it had sat in the window for a few minutes before coming to the table. My dining partners ordered other things and weren't all that enthused. I feel like the number one aspect of dining out is urgency, and making sure the food can be enjoyed by the guest in it's ideal state, hot obviously. This was not the case. I did not send it back, but I definitely noticed. The local veggies side dish was great, as well as the asparagus and tasty aioli. The icing on the cake was the brownie sundae we all shared for dessert. The ice cream was eh, but the brownie was AMAZING. It literally blew our minds!

So, in conclusion. I keep coming back because it is a decent place that is down the street, but you'll have to step up the food experience factor to get some more stars out of me."}
{"text":"Great Brunch Burger and Cleveland Eggs Benedict. Service was a bit slow but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner at about 5:30 which was apparently the perfect time to arrive on a Saturday. Place was practically empty-- by the time we left the joint was POPPIN. Amazing beer selection, lots of stuff from out of state which was fun. I got a Moscow mule -- very good. My boyfriend got the DKB burger and loved it. I got the honeycrisp salad + chicken. It was really refreshing and well, fresh! The dressing was great!! Good portion sizes-- a little bit pricier but good quality food. Our waitress was also very friendly and attentive! Would certainly return!"}
{"text":"Deagan's has a nice brunch.  I've been here several times over the years for brunch and dinner.  My favorite is brunch.  

On our last visit the beau and I sat at the bar as the wait was a bit and we don't mind the bar.  Our bartenders Jenna and Emily were really nice.  They made great recommendations for drinks and food, and ensured we were taken care of for our meal.

The man ordered chicken & waffles & collards.  The balance of the sweet, salty, and spicy was perfect!  I ordered the crab Benedict.  The eggs were perfectly prepared and the crab cake was tasty.  The man also ordered a couple Bloody Mary's which he completed at the Bloody Mary Bar.  YUM!  I had mimosas and well, you can't go wrong there.  Our bartenders smiled largely when we ordered Irish Car Bombs and were super excited that we, two crazy people, were doing these for brunch. Hello, car bombs are like coffee with brunch! 

I'd recommend this place.  They have a nice rotating menu with seasonal items and good vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Brunch review. I like places that offer brunch on both Saturdays and Sundays.  The more brunch the merrier. I enjoyed the unique mimosa flavors of the week: blueberry and bing cherry. I really enjoyed their tasty spin on chicken and waffles.  It was a sweet potato waffle, with crispy fried chicken, and fried Brussels sprouts. I will need to stop back in to try more, it appears they change up their brunch menu frequently."}
{"text":"Great spot. Lots of delicious food, tons of great beers, the owner is a good dude as well."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Deagan's more than three stars, but based on the food alone, this place is pretty average. The prices are decent and they are more than willing to try to accommodate my dad's strange diet (veagan + no oil), but I've had my share of things on the menu and I wasn't overly impressed with anything. The tacos are good and pretty cheap, especially on Taco Tuesday's. The desserts are also pretty good, try the homemade cream. Where this place really shines, however, is the decor and clientele. The way the restaurant is able to be sophisticated, but laid back at the same time draws in all of the different types of people who live in or around Lakewood. I feel comfortable dining at Deagan's in shorts and a tshirt or heels, and that's what I really love about it. Although the food isn't anything to write home about, I'll continue to go there."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The food is always great. Maybe I've been lucky, but I've never had a problem with parking or getting a table. Their beer selections is very good - a lot of variety, with some popular selections mixed in with some hard-to-find selections."}
{"text":"Just home from our first visit to Deagan's, we were very impressed. Found the staff friendly, our server Jenna was fantastic and an asset to the restaurant. The interior was classy yet not pretentious . Very well done . Could not believe this place used to be Pickle bills. We went on Wednesday due to the fact that I'm vegan. So excited as it is so hard to find vegan food in the area. It was amazing! I applaud the chef . My companions enjoyed the fish and chips and deviled eggs. We also shared the vegan dessert which was an apple turnover which was a treat.We look forward to our next visit. Thank you Deagan's, we highly recommend your establishment to all:)
Trish"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Deagan's. The atmosphere is casual, and the staff are very helpful. The food and drink menu are what really sets this place apart from most other eateries. 

The spicy shrimp tacos are great. The duck confit mac and cheese was absolutely delicious.  

This isn't the place you would go to drink your bud light and miller lite.  Topshelf quality craft beers are the smart choice here.

Enjoy!  And get used to it cause you'll find yourself going back.  Often."}
{"text":"This review is simply for their Taco Tuesdays. I haven't tried their regular dinner menu items yet!

I went with a few friends that I went to college with (GO BLUE!) to meet up for Taco Tuesday. When we arrived at 7, it was pretty full. The restaurant itself is very cozy and inviting for a gastropub.

I ordered 3 tacos and that was enough for me. They range from $3-4 a taco. I had the shrimp taco, braised beef, and duck. Parts of the duck taco were a little dry and hard to chew, but I would give it another shot. Braised beef was good; shrimp taco was probably my favorite. It had some pretty good flavors. Mmmm.

Overall, tacos were not bad, but not mind blowing either. Perhaps I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice find in Lakewood.

We randomly decided to try this place out one afternoon. This place is the definition of a gastropub - there's a nice bar atmosphere, but the food is more than your usual burger and fries.

All of their small tapas dishes are worth a try, the quail is especially nice. For main dish, I got the Amish chicken and waffles and thought it was delicious. During the week, they have specials every night (not uncommon in the Cleveland area) and they have a nice selection on tap.

The only downside I can think of is that the price is comparable to more of a nicer place versus a bar.

Try it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Lots of excellent vegetarian and vegan options on the menu.  I loved the seitan curry: big chunks of crispy-chewy seitan in a delicious spicy curry. The deviled eggs are as good and creamy as they say.  The vegan chocolate was rich and dark, if not a little too dense.  Overall, a great place for vegetarians and vegans to enjoy a meal with their carnivore friends."}
{"text":"So this review is concerning the Fish and Chips only. I've had some great meals here, but one evening I went for my old standby.  I have to say it was kind of a failure. Here's the score by the numbers.

1. The fish:  A few good sized cuts of what appeared to be pretty fresh cod (i think). Three stars.
2. The Batter:  Not so good.  It was doughy and soggy and had no element of crispiness. It also kind of fell off the fish a little too readily. It was well seasoned though.  1.5 Stars.
3. The Chips:  Ok so these are their seasoned fries.  These are always really good, but in this case I feel like the chips definitely out shined the fish, which is a deduction. Three stars.
4. Accompaniments: The tarter sauce was cold and creamy but lacked a bit of that tartness that you want and so seemed a little bland.  There was no malt vinegar, had to ask. I did appreciate that there were 2 lemon wedges. 2.5 stars.
5. X factors:  Pretty solid beer selection and a Glenlivet neat.! 4 stars.

Averaged up that's a mere 2.8 stars.  I will round that to the nearest star for the rating above. Considering that the x-factors pretty well saved the score here I would definitely go with another menu item in the future."}
{"text":"GREAT Beer Selection!  The food is always good, however the lunch menu can be a little small on options. Service is typically above average and friendly. It is also a nice looking restaurant with authentic styling. It can be a bit process for lunch and they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying I have always really enjoyed Deagans but I went there today for dinner and have been vegan for quite a bit and always expect good options here...but tonight pretty much none. I wanted a salad with falafel, when it was on the menu as an entree, but the waitress was a quick and stern no any vegan toppings on a salad. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go if you want to play games and grab some food.  Everyone is very nice.  Pretty good beer selection."}
{"text":"Super yum, great vibe, they told me the name and farm of the chicken that was being served that night, what more could I ask for?  Added bonus was that they had Arrogant Bastard on tap.
Service was quick and they didn't bug us when we sat there for an hour talking.
Free WiFi too."}
{"text":"Always something new and different on the menu. Love their blt made with pork belly!"}
{"text":"Deagan's is seriously one of a kind!! It has a super hipster vibe with many unique dishes to choose from. I came here for a birthday dinner, and they were able to accommodate over 20 of us! I ordered the chicken and waffles because I've heard so many great things about it! The chicken was really crispy and tender. The waffles were a bit dry, but still tolerable lol I loved the scoop of butter on top of the chicken. I have no clue what it's made of, but it's damn good! The side of brussel sprouts were HEAVENLY! So well cooked and so flavorful :)  I also tried some of my friend's calamari. Mmmm!! I loved the way Deagan's spiced it! It's hands down the best calamari I've ever had :) 

Their drink menu is also pretty impressive! I ordered the Fall Manhattan. Super strong drink, but goes down very smoothly! I'm looking forward to more dining experiences here :)"}
{"text":"The food and service was great, but the cost was more than I expected. 3 of us shared an appetizer. One soda, one water, one beer. All the dinners were great (salmon, Mac/cheese/chicken, and beer battered fish and chips).  With 15% tip it came to $86."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to Degans brunch and I was sad to be disappointed. Our donuts were cold...so were my potatoes. I love their vegan nites & the dishes they serve at dinner...even taco Tuesdays are our favorite! But maybe we will just stick to that as brunch was not up to their normal par! :("}
{"text":"We were visiting friends and stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. There was a street art fair happening but we were lucky to grab a seat without any problem. The menu sounded so good and I found it hard to choose. I decided on the green bean salad with grilled chicken. OMG it was amazing! I was really pleasantly surprised with the flavors and combination of ingredients. Green beans, goat cheese, almonds... I was a little nervous about the addition of orange wedges but they were great mixed in with everything else. The chicken was really good too (seems like sometimes chicken add-ons can be a hit or miss).

The rest of the table seemed very pleased with their food (my husband loved the bison meatloaf) and our server Meghan was just so sweet and helpful... I really wish I had the \"people skills\" she does!

I didn't love the layout of the restaurant and it wasn't shiny and new... Tiny missed details (sticky menu, no TP, etc.) hinted that they must be busy a lot. Despite the misses (hey, no one's perfect...) I'd definitely dine here again if in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Deagan's.  I really did.  It's convenient.  It appears to have a diverse beer menu.  And the food menu looks good- if you are simply reading it and not eating it.  

Actually there are two things I liked about Deagan's: the exposed brick and the copper tin-pressed ceiling.  It was pretty and warm in there. 

But the food....ehhh......everything appeared to be garnished with the same greens. (I'll post a photo.)  I had the deviled egg (1).  It wasn't awful, but it was just so-so; my grandma makes a better deviled egg.  I had the fennel salad.  This was alright.  Nothing special.  And I had the pierogies, which were smothered in some sort of white sauce and not really what I would define as a \"pierogie\".  $10 for two small ones.  You can get an entire plateful for $5 at Around the Corner.  

The service was fair.  I sat at the bar.  The bartender seemed disinterested and off in her own world.  Another bartender appeared a bit later and refilled my soda, which was nice. (I wasn't in a beer sort of mood.)

I wish I had something to say with a little more luster and a little more shine.  But I don't.  So I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Wow. I love this place. Went here for the second time and it was perfect. Once again got both the Pumpking beer and the devils on horseback. That Pumpking beer, it's magical. I can't decide what my favorite beer of all time is, either Pumpking or The Brugge (in Indianapolis) Tripel de Ripple. Anyways we went on a busy Friday evening this time. The wait was only about 30min during prime time. A lot of little things here make me happy. The wooden theme which feels nice and warm along with the lighting. The ample room for people waiting at the entrance then also standing room around the bar. It was easy to get beers while we waited (a lot of bars you can technically get a drink while you wait but the arrangement of the bar means you would have to rudely get right on top of someone to get a drink, not this one because the bar is so large you can find an in and the bartenders are very attentive) and there was a ledge built into some of the wall/pillars around the bar so we had a ledge to sit our beer on and phones and scarves and to lean on. Then we were seated and the waitress remembered us from the one time we had been there months ago which was cool (ok and a little creepy lol) . We got the devils on horseback (still no pic because I can't wait to eat them but I see someone else succeeded in this endeavor) and we got the deviled eggs which had goat cheese and were very good. Next time we have to try the angels on horseback. Then I got the shrimp tacos and a side of asparagus. It was delicious! The shrimp tacos were the best I have ever had. The shrimp and guacamole were so creamy together and plenty of cilantro. It was great. And the asparagus were humongous and perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce was perfect with them.  The bf got one of the specials, can't remember the name exactly but pic included. It was good but mine was better. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a DEFINITE 4.5 stars!! Just popped in with my Fiancé and his family and had a lovely time in the ambience that is Deagan's. Not only do they use Maker's Mark in their old fashioneds for $7, but they make a delicious chicken and waffle!! The chicken could have used a bit of salt but the brussels sprouts and waffle were PERFECTION!! The service was zippy and the only thing that took away the half a star were the mussels. They were lukewarm and as the family said, seemed to have a lake taste to them. Other than that, awesome place and I would definitely go again!!"}
{"text":"I really like Deagan's! 

The food that I had was delicious. I do hear some people not caring for Deagan's calling themselves a Gastro-pub. I won't label them anything but a bar and restaurant with tasty, new-american food, and great beer menu. 

I ordered quite a bit. Brussel sprouts that were perfectly cooked with bacon and butter. Jumbo lump crab hushpuppies that were to die for! Honestly I would go back just for beers and those puppies. Kobe beef meatballs were alright. Nothing spectacular. In fact I felt the tomato sauce they covered them with took away from the beef. And also I believe Kobe should be served medium rare, these were not. 

Good beer list as well. Many craft brews and high-potency ales. I was probably drunk by the time we left. My stay endured 830p to after 130am. Sat with some good friends, to chat drink and play trivia."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and both have been great. Once for happy hour and once for lunch (after finding out Melt had a 45 minute wait on the a weekday, whhhaaaa?!?) Anyway, I digress... 

Deagan's is a really well put together bar/restaurant for the 28 plus crowd, which I am, so I love it. 
I had a grilled cheese and tomato bisque that was amazing, who needs Melt? I don't really believe in waiting in a queue when there are so many great options, and I've never had to wait here. Great option in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos and they were cold and we waited way to long for our order. My dad got the simple \"burger\" and he didn't even eat half of it, which was shocking considering he will eat anything and everything. The burger was undercooked. My husband complained he didn't like his meal either time he went, and we both left out not impressed at all. Cheese board was good, but there wasn't anything else that had us wanting to come back :("}
{"text":"I liked it a lot, lot ... cool combinations. Basically a neighborhood bar and restaurant that serves a cut above.  had the veal chip which was excellent.  My wife's burger was very good, but she did not like the cinnamon on the sweet potato fries.  Service was good and nice.  Definitely a good watering hole as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a business trip. Was a strong suggestion from coworkers and it did not disappoint. The menu had several intriguing selections and I went with the chicken and waffles and it was great. Nice fun place."}
{"text":"Deagan's only gets better with time, apparently. Been a few times (though not as much as I would like) over the past couple years and every time it's a great experience. 

First and foremost, I would just like to put it out there that Deagan's is great about gluten-/wheat-free. Having a wheat allergy, it's a challenge to find places I can eat out without even a mild reaction. Their staff is on top of it, easily pointing out favorites that are gluten-free (all listed on the regular menu and they also have a GF menu with those specific items highlighted). They're great with questions and very proactive about making sure that everything stays allergen free.

What can I say about Deagan's? I've honestly never had a bad experience here. It has amazing food for the prices. The atmosphere is relaxed and can work for a variety of events from a romantic night out or happy hour to brunch with friends and family. 

Most recently, we went for Sunday brunch and we loved it. The deviled eggs sampler in particular was stellar. Also really enjoyed the shrimp and grits. None of us were brave enough to try the Bloody Mary bar, but it looked great!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, the menu was a little overwhelming and a little confusion what I ordered was great. I ordered 3 small plates and truley impressed by their mini soft buns stuffed with duck confit. Great casual dinning, works for large groups."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and loved it both times.  Of course, the trick to eating at a gastropub is to order something abnormal.  If you order something basic and you're disappointed because it didn't feel like your mouth was Times Square on New Years Eve, I'm not sure how to console you.

However, if you look for something inventive with a blend of tastes or textures that you wouldn't expect to work, I'm willing to be the decision will pay off.

Bring friends, order a ton of stuff, and try a little bit of everything.  Or just go back frequently.  Either way you'll enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Thank you, Deagan's!  You have performed a miracle!  Brussels sprouts to me were grotesque and I would have thought pigs would fly before I would ever eat one voluntarily.  Your Brussels sprouts are so delicious that I will eat my words!!  And a zillion more of your yummy Brussels sprouts.  Deagans is great.  The food us fantastic and the staff is awesome!  Can't say enough about Deagans!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh the joys of dining, drinking, and brunching at Deagans. I'm a huge fan of the Eat Local Food trend. Deagans is up there on the list of using locally sourced meats, produce, and cheese which makes my belly say \"More Deagans please\". OK, my mouth says \"more Deagans please\" and my belly says \"feed me more Deagans\". I work in Lakewood and frequent the bar on a regular basis for lunch and a beer..... or two."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place --- I have to compliment them on the vegetarian night on Wednesday.. it's refreshing to have choices!!!  
The drink selection was excellent ... great beers and nice wine by the glass!  The menu could of had a few more selections .. but I was happy with it!  The only thing I didn't like was the fried tofu ... it needs to be pan fried.. they killed it.  But the Eggplant Parm and soba noodles.. outstanding!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite food in Lakewood. The Mac and cheese is amazing. Every time I've been there the food has been great. Their specials are well worth it. Only reason I'm not giving it five is because I had wings that were over cooked. The soy chili sauce as amazing though. Sunday brunch is worth a visit too"}
{"text":"The place has got the hype! No denying that fact. Have gotten out the word of the specials on various days! We went on a vegan/veggie night on a Wednesday. It was packed around 8pm and were seated after a 20 min wait. Ambience is that of a sports bar with not many television. Noice level is high which definitely avoids some embarrasment for families like us with a 2 yr old screaming at the top of his voice. 
The pimms cup with lime juice and 7up is light in the beginning but gets to you if sipping on an empty stomach. Amish chicken wings had a smokey BBQ flavour and lite too sweet for our taste. Veg sliders were the best part of our meal, however for $10 I could have taken a spicy chicken sandwich from wendy's and a large Cajun fries from 5 guys and would have enjoyed it better. Lastly the potato gnocchi is so bland that we finished half the pepper and salt shaker. No pun intended. Why the 3 stars, that's because of how the owners have hyped the place to make it busier than many restaurants are even on weekends. Price is reasonable for the portion!!"}
{"text":"Been here a solid 25 times and it is always 4 or 5 stars.  This place is also great for kids.  I don't know what these other asshats are talking about.  The kid's menu has hotdogs, hamburgers, and chicken fingers.  If that is fancy, go eat out of the dumpster.  That is about it.  Mainly came on here to give a well deserved 5 stars and call Yelp reviewers asshats."}
{"text":"This was my third time visiting Deagan's and each has been better than the last. From the House Fries, to the Mac and Cheese, there is a wide variety of delicious entrees to suit any taste. The servers have always been very attentive and helpful.

I'd recommend starting with a Bar Snack before exploring all the Big Plate options. No matter what you decide on, it'll be great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to enjoy the Wednesday Vegan specials night Deagan's offers (Thank you Deagn's for having this!) An all around excellent experience. 

Started off with the Ponzo Marinated Tofu Soba Noodle bar bites. A delightful mix of  soba noodles, cahews, green onions, and fried tofu, with a soy sauce type sauce. Really good, wish there was a little more to the sauce than just the salty soy sauce taste though.

The boy got the Braised Unicorn, which tasted to me like veal, and was cashew crusted- which is an automatic extra star for me! Came with whipped mashed potatoes, carrots, and some sort of salady sprout (sunflower sprouts?) All were very tasty and was nice to get an upscale-ish vegan meal without the drive to Akron for Vegiterranean. Only critique- could have used some sort of sauce (again) to spice it up a little and make it really stand out as a 5-star meal (there was a green sauce, but not sure what it was, and couldn't really taste it with the food). I would give his meal a 9/10!

I got the less exciting Eggplant small plate. But less exciting does not mean bad-- just doesn't have Unicorn in the name. Another excellent dish- fried eggplant rolled up like manicotti, stuffed with ricotta cheese, arugula, and topped with stewed plum tomatoes. Very very good, my second favorite in the city after La Strada/La Dolce Vita. (Note to Deagan's-- served in bowl, this dish should probably be on a flat(er) plate, its almost impossible to cut into bite sizes in a bowl. And the bowl is so small, I had to set my silverware on the table when I didn't want to hold up a fork and knife every last second I was trying to enjoying my meal.)

I didn't try any of the cocktails, but they have a small but good list of classic cocktails, which is always appreciated over the Applebees-esque list of frozen frou-frou drinks! I will try one next time... Happy hour is $1 off all drinks :)

Looks like this place has what it takes to stay in the ever-revolving Lakewood restaurant spot, where businesses come and go every 8 months. Great job Deagan's!"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions.
PRO: Best salmon I've ever had. Seriously. The best. Ever.
Chicken and waffles is good too.
CON: Portion size! We've eaten here a handful of times, and I typically leave hungry. 
If they could just serve up some rolls, I'd be fine.
Like the vibe of the bar, but it's not really a place many people hang out after about 10 p.m."}
{"text":"After hearing so many rave reviews I had to finally check this place out for myself. They have a typical gastropub menu with a wide selection of beer... what's not to like. We advised the server that this was our first time there so she went out of her way to explain menu items. She was very helpful. We started with the nuts as an appetizer. Warm nuts in your mouth - yum! This was better than it sounds. The nuts came warm with a butter and brown sugar type glaze and fresh herbs. Seriously good! I got the surf n turf which consisted of filet medallions with lobster mashed potatoes. I would have licked the plate if it wouldn't have been a super gross thing to do in a restaurant. One of these days I will have to make it back for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Came her for lunch and was shocked by the prices.  I'm not a fan of these kind of places, trendy, hipster gastropubs. I oreded a house salad, I received lettuce with a dash a dressing for $6.  the tomato basil soup was like I opened up a can of Heinz tomato paste and started eating, no crackers with the soup.  the only reason this gets 3 stars is because the turkey club was delicious. way way way over priced."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both times for lunch. I remember I wasn't too impressed with the food during my first visit, but I'm glad I gave this place another shot because the second experience has really changed my mind. 
I had the chicken and waffle which was undeniably good, and it particularly stood out from chicken and waffles at other establishments because of the cayenne butter. The chicken was cooked really well...juicy on the inside with a crispy crust. The collards and bacon on the side was also a nice touch. My only addition to the meal would have been a considerably more syrup."}
{"text":"\"Gastropub\"? Who cares. I do like Deagan's though. 

Been here twice now. Had a cheese plate and tacos the first time. Both were pretty good. There could have been more cheese though. Slices were a tad thin. The shrimp tacos were pretty darn tasty. 

On a more recent visit, I had the Fish and Chips. The fish was excellent (and I get F&C everywhere I go). The batter was crispy and the fish chunks were generous and thick. The spicy mayo was a perfect addition as well. The \"chips\", not so much. Soggy and cold. Bummer. But the greatness of the perfectly prepared fish made me forget about them. 

The beer selection rocks. They seem to have a bunch of groovy offerings especially the Dragon's Milk Ale (my new favorite beer).

Service was good and we were seated immediately (although it was a weeknight). I can see this place getting really crowded on weekends. 

I love the space. Lots of exposed brick and rich dark wood. Worlds different from most places in Lakewood. It's a welcomed addition. 

I am somewhat annoyed by the whole Gastropub proclamation though. It's on the menu, it's on the wall, it's everywhere you look. I get it. Gastropub. Gastropub. Gastropub. 

Deagan's is what?"}
{"text":"I really didn't like the grilled cheese. Was super oily and moist. Honestly I could make a better one at home. Although the fries are delicious. I also did not enjoy the pickle that was added when I didn't even request it. It was my first time coming here but I was not satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious food and nice beer selection. The a la cart menu is both a blessing and a curse - the portions were reasonable but I ended up ordering more food after my order arrived because the portion was entirely too small. Womp womp but very tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars here. The tacos on Taco Tuesday are amazing and the crowd of people that are there on Tuesdays is proof of that. The menu is really creative and it offers specials for lunch and dinner. 
The beer menu is extensive, which, I admit is something we look for in a good restaurant. Save room for dessert, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  I've dined at Deagan's on four or five occasions with a variety of different companions.  Vegetarians, meat lovers and seafood lovers will all find delicious options.  The Moules Frittes (Mussels and fries) with sausage and blue cheese is wonderful, as is the Fish and Chips.  Taco Tuesdays are a favorite!  Bike Thursdays offers 15% off for anyone riding their bicycle to dinner.  Angels on Half Back (3 bacon wrapped scallops) are an awesome appetizer.  The Crispy Eggplant small plate was also a big hit with my dining companion.  Next, I'm looking forward to trying the burger or Hangar Steak.  Haven't tried the Sunday Brunch yet but that is also on the To Do list."}
{"text":"Deagan's Kitchen and Bar has only been in Cleveland (actually, Lakewood if you'd like to get specific) for about two years and they've already won the hearts of what I think is one of the most skeptical groups of people in the country - Clevelanders.  I should know I happen to be one. We've been through a lot, we know what we like and we aren't afraid to tell you how it is. Clearly, Deagan's has it right. The awards are already coming in and, more importantly, so are the people. On a recent visit back home to Cleveland I was lucky enough to get to pay them a visit.

We arrived around lunchtime on a Saturday afternoon. It was just before noon so the crowd was a tad on the light side. We took a seat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the smiling Chrissy. She appeared genuinely happy to see us and responded by providing us with the beer list and some menus. This is something I've grown used to not seeing in Baltimore. More often than not, customers in some Baltimore establishments are seen as more of an irritation than guests. This was not the case at Deagan's. I felt truly welcome.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The aged look of the renovated turn-of-the-century building wraps itself around a marble bar top and the unmatched chairs and wood-topped tables are right at home. It just feels like somewhere I would love to spend a cold winter's night sipping a hearty barleywine and noshing on some tasty grub. Speaking of beer, Deagan's is definitely a destination for all beer lovers. They've got nearly 30 taps that rotate often and if for some reason you can't find what you want there they've got a hearty bottle list as well. Looking for Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, they've got it. How about Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard on tap? Yeah, that too. I was blown away by the excellent selection. It was clear that someone knows their beer and wants to share their love with everyone. They had me at Ommegang Gnomegang.

So what about the grub? I've seen a lot of establishments throw around the term \"gastropub\" without regard to its true meaning - a pub that specializes in high-quality, inventive dishes. Deagan's can be proud to call themselves a gastropub in the truest sense of the word. Their menu is perfectly concise and features delectable delights crafted from locally-sourced ingredients (Amish chicken and Lake Erie goat cheese anyone?). This is not bar food it's intelligently crafted location-specific gastro art. I can't speak to more than one menu item, but I've gotta tell ya, if it's any indication as to the rest of the story I can't wait to return.

My brother-in-law couldn't stop talking about their chicken and waffles. He swore they were the best he's ever had and that I couldn't leave town without trying them. Yeah, whatever. I've heard it all before. Fine, but I wasn't expecting much. Oh...my...God...I don't know how they did it, but these were no mere chicken and waffles. The waffle was just slightly sweet and a wonderful balance of both crisp and chewy. Cayenne butter? Yeah, I know. And the chicken. I think this may have been the single best piece of fried chicken I have ever eaten. Crispy, well-seasoned breading, moist and juicy Amish-raised chicken. Toss in some homemade blackberry maple syrup and I words aren't enough. If I could only have one more meal for the rest of my life this would be a contender. If you eat here you have to try this dish. 

I swore I wouldn't get involved again. But nonetheless Deagan's and I have started a relationship anyway. I thought I was content with the restaurants I already knew;  I didn't want to spread myself any thinner. But you can't stop love and it often shows up when you're least expecting it. When I'm driving back to Baltimore I'll be thinking about you, wondering when I'll get to see you again and hoping, just a little, that you're thinking about me too. Until we meet again...

P.S.
Don't touch that chicken and waffles recipe or else..."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a no-brainer. Classic American food, and a solid staff. I've enjoyed the simple stuff like the Reuben, or salads. There's something to be said about a restaurant who can do simple foods extremely well. Sometimes it's just what you need. 

I don't get over to the west side, but the lovable staff, and simple stuff make it worth it every time."}
{"text":"UPDATE The bread pudding is much improved now - its made of Brandy infused ice-cream as well as brandy infused caramel, garnished with berries.  The bread pudding definitely an adult version and it is perfectly balanced with moist sweet taste and the brandy ice-cream cannot be left behind.   Deagan's improvement of this item is an astronomical improvement to the former version. They are still carrying the seasonal Summer Shandy (as of this update). My second visit at Deagan's led me to taste Hawaiian Opah ( a white-salmon type fish, see the uploaded pic) medium well prepared and server with vinaigrette and garnished with bean sprouts.  If you like fish this is a great tasty fish entree to try.  It does have a slight fishy smell to it, thus the need for a liking to fish to try this.

--------------   

I went to Deagan's based on Rachel's and Cara's review.

The drinks and beer are most definitely high-end but not all are high-price.  Although, their food quality is very good but are not as high-end as that of a true european gastropub.  I will however return to Deagan's.  I want to try many of variety of beer on the tap and menu.  I had the Summer Shandy as well as the Shandygaff - the former amber ale the later a mixed beer.  Both very impressive with the right blend of hop & taste.  Feeling somewhat adventurous I ordered their \"Crisp Chicken Livers, pork belly over polenta, shallots\".   I found this dish prepared with a good balance of crisp from the batter but slightly overcooked livers and pork belly.  We also had the \"Chocolate Almond Bread Pudding\" which I found to be far too dry than expected. 

There was a bit of confusion with our wait staff due to shift change that led us to wait 15 min before even served drinks.  We were noticed by a neighboring table wait staff who immediately corrected the issue and even had the manager stop by and offer us our first round of drinks on the house.  I must say, this was very impressive.  This is EXACTLY how an eatery should address snafu that come up.  From my perspective, no one is perfect and running a busy eatery has its challenges, but when the staff graciously take responsibility of oversight and do their best to correct it - that's the mark of a customer service oriented establishment.  

Deagan's has a lot of promise and potential.  They definitely show desire to grow and I felt they are still trying to perfect their offerings.  One suggestion I might have is for them to maybe reduce the number of diverse food items on the menu and increase & perfect the quality of the fewer items."}
{"text":"Went there on 'accident' after another restaurant had too long a wait.  What a great mistake!  Food was incredible and the atmosphere was very warm and friendly.  I particularly like the modern-rustic look they have going on.

On a side note, there seems to be a lot of beautiful people working there too...but it doesn't seem intentional.  Anyhow, the service is top-notch.

Food is great from the small plates to big and their beer selection is wonderfully diverse.

Finally, it seems like a great place to go for a date, with a group of friends, or with your kids.  Amazing how that can all work!  Definitely plan on going again!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in Lakewood. It has a very large space and when I went on a popular Friday night, I had to wait *maybe* five minutes. Not bad at all. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and very helpful in explaining the menu and taking our order. I should also make a note that the drink menu was very well curated and impressive."}
{"text":"Went there for a few drinks with family and friends. Service was a hit or miss. Our server was nice however definitely heard some rudeness from others.
Drinks were okay. Had the fries and Brussel sprouts which were both good."}
{"text":"One word: WOOF - not in a good way. Tried this place and got a bunch of apps. Flavorless polenta NEEDED the sauce, the dough dough doughy Reuben Pierogies were served without any flavor. I don't even remember the third appetizer. 

Went back for brunch recently. Woof. Bloody Mary Bar is a nice idea but no regular Franks Style hot sauce? Just specialty sauces with punny names - too confusing. And then my meal. Woof. Hash and eggs. Looked like dog food. No one asked how I liked my eggs so they came fried. Said it came with potatoes and yes, there were 5 little pieces of potato in the bowl. 

My tip - if you must go, make sure your table has salt and pepper."}
{"text":"After looking through many brunch places in the neighborhood, we finally settled on Deagan's. We got in around noon and were seated instantly even without reservations (there were five of us.) Our server was super polite. She told us about the specials a few minutes after having seated us. If you're into mimosas as much as I am, you will be in for a treat. They've got many different flavors and (angel chorus) they have mango mimosas! They also let you make your own Bloody Mary, which is cool.

The food was really, really good. I got he monkey bread cinnamon rolls and they were so good I could've had five. Got to try the clam chowder, too, and although it was a little too watery for me, it was still decent. I got bombbb chicken and waffles for my main dish. It was delicious. We couldn't have picked a better brunch spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, large portions and best Calamari i've ever had. Great place to get together for drinks too, very nice bar a lot of good beers on tap. You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Solid brunch place (they had me at Bloody Mary bar). I'd like to rave about all the esoteric food options, but between the 9 of us we mostly got omelettes and fried chicken + waffles. The lobster macaroni did seem like a tasty choice, but I was perfectly happy with my omelette that looked like a burrito."}
{"text":"My husband and I were one of those couples that went out on Valentine's weekend.  Usually this spells disaster...but it turned out really nicely.  We were sat immediately and had our wine sitting in front of us somewhere within 5-7 mins.  The mussels were REALLY delish and the shaved Brussels sprouts were fantastic.  That's all I ordered and was full with some sprouts to take home.  My husband had a chicken Caesar and was also very satisfied.  I've eaten here before and was usually pleased with the experience, but this was a particularly nice evening"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Deagan's for a while, and my first visit definitely didn't disappoint!

I went for dinner on a Friday night and got there around 7:45 or 8, and there was about a 45 minute wait. We were fine with that and grabbed some beers (Southern Tier Pumking is definitely one of my favorite beers ever!!), and the bartenders seemed really friendly. A table was ready pretty close to 45 minutes later, but it was right near the back door so I unfortunately I was freeeeezing throughout the entire meal. I know someone has to sit there, but come on - that's what double entrance doors are for! I was also way too hungry to wait for another table.

Our server - I think her name was Shelly - was amazing! She was super knowledgeable and friendly, and pointed out some of the most popular items as well as her personal favorites. She was also personable and attentive without going overboard. We started with the Angels on Horseback and the calamari. The calamari was probably the best calamari I've had - we couldn't stop talking about it, and I loved the sauces that came with it!

For dinner, we got a wagyu culotte steak that was on special, as well as the chicken and waffles. I tasted the steak and it was buttery and delicious! My chicken and waffles were pretty good, but probably the wrong item for me to have ordered for my personal taste. However, the portion was massive, so I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something very filling! After the beers and the appetizers I ended up eating about a third of it, tops. 

The food came out really fast - which is sort of good, but sort of not good. It was nice to have our appetizers quickly, but our entrees came out right as we were finishing the apps, and I would have liked to have a little break in between. I guess I understand that on busy nights they're getting the food out as fast as possible, and it would've been way worse to have been waiting forever, so I'll get over it. :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch today.  The Veggie Sliders and the dressed up pomme frites that come with them are seriously some of the best bar food out there.  Very good service today -- it can get a little cutesy/overbearing but was perfect today."}
{"text":"DON'T BELIEVE THE OVERALL RATINGS HERE--Deagans has changed for the worse in the past year.

I used to love this place. USED to. The new chef has ruined the entire menu. The duck mac and cheese was heavenly. The \"new\" mac and cheese is the worst I've ever had. No real flavor and the peas weren't really cooked at all. The \"bacon\" was total fat and not cooked properly, therefore added no flavor. I don't even like salt, but I had to pour salt and pepper on this just to taste any of it. Baba ganouj was the worst I've ever had (TOTALLY over-salted). 

I went a month ago and we ordered a burger, medium well. When it arrived medium rare, my friend sent it back. It was returned medium rare AGAIN (seriously, dripping with blood). I ordered the fish and chips that time. Worst fish and chips ever. Again, no flavor, not even salt. And I had the shaved brussel sprouts which were totally over-salted. 

The vegan night menu seems to be the only good food left at Deagans. SO DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience at Deagan's! Our server was Brittany, and I definitely recommend her. She dealt with our fat asses ordering a billion small plates and multiple glasses of wine between 3 of us during a busy Indians game. We got the big cheese platter, loaded tots, deviled eggs, house salad, pirogies, and Mac and cheese. All of it was AMAZING. But my favorites were then pirogies and deviled eggs. Will definitely be visiting Deagan's frequently!"}
{"text":"Good brunch!  Comfy and relaxed atmosphere.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, which was good, but I was looking for a LITTLE bit more flavor.  I will definitely come again to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for dinner. Hostess was very polite. Atmosphere was nice but it was a little drafty. Beer selection was ample. Started w/ marrow bone ($7) first time trying it.. I read it was supposed to taste like buttery beef w/ a jello like consistency. NO, THIS  smelled somewhat foul & tasted the same. 2 dime size scoops. Pickled veggies were yummy. House salad ($7) was fresh. For entrees, we ordered chicken & dumplings w/ pearl onion, parmesan broth,& asparagus..pricey for portion, but chicken was tender & the dish tasted great. Also, ordered the mac & cheese w/ braised beef, onion, spinach, & gouda.. beef ample, spinach not so much, but again this dish tasted great."}
{"text":"The truffle fries at this place are wonderful, as well as the Mac n' cheese. It's a little more pricey, but you can get good food for the price. Sports-bar type feel and a bit dimmer of lighting during the day than I personally like, but it's a great dinner and happy hour place to go."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner over thanksgiving weekend and was super excited based on fellow yelper's reviews, but was let down by the experience. Here's why:
*chopped brussel sprouts- if you love oil and grease, then this is for you...the cheesy bacon-ness drowned out the natural goodness of the veggies...was hoping for something more nutritious/fresh-tasting here (1-star)
*chicken and waffles- these we're pretty good (4-star)
*braised short rib- standard but overpriced for your basic crock pot dinner (2-star)

Overall a decent meal, but I was expecting much more culinarily prowess for a top-rated gastropub. Also the bar refused to give us happy hour pricing on our drinks because we were not 'seated at the bar' :(...this is lame because we we're at a plain bar-like table 3 feet from the bar itself...plus there is no way we could get my grandmother up on those high barstools...so clearly, Deagans hates old people (just joking....kinda). They should update this policy and extend HH pricing restaurant wide."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, as I had heard great reviews from friends. What an awful experience. As soon as our drink order was taken, I complimented the server's necklace. Her response? \"Cool.\" Her disinterest and rudeness continued throughout our meal. My boyfriend asked how the quail eggs were - all she said was \"good\". He then asked if he could get them without chorizo and she said \"nope\", offering no explanation. I wanted to leave right then and there because I couldn't justify paying $15-20 a plate for such rude service - this is supposed to be a nice restaurant, not Dick's Last Resort. We finally decided on food and the disappointment continued. My chicken and waffles was terrible. The chicken was dry and overcooked and the waffle was akin to an Eggo waffle that had sat out for a day or two - hard, crispy, and difficult to cut into. At least the Brussels sprouts were good. I wanted to send my plate back immediately but by the time our server checked on us my boyfriend was halfway through his less-than-delightful coconut curry. I could also tell the server was pushing drinks - asking both of us if we wanted another beer when our glasses were still 3/4ths full... although I suppose my experience would have been better if I was fall-off-my-chair drunk. If I were paying, she would not have gotten a tip (coming from a former bartender). I took my mostly-intact chicken and waffles home to feed to the dog and she even scoffed at the chicken, pretty significant for a pooch who will ransack the garbage can for days-old chicken nuggets. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed and will not recommend or return. Save your money and emotions by picking up Thai takeout and having your toddler make chicken and waffles, as I'm sure they could've done a better job."}
{"text":"We took Father-in-Law here for our yearly Christmas lunch together.  He usually picks where we go and this was another good choice!  We were the first table in the restaurant and I was a little worried about the kiddos, but this is a kid-friendly place.  
We tried a ton of things: fries with romano cheese and truffles, waldorf salad, seared scallops, falafel plate, pulled pork sandwich, and the kiddo had a hotdog.  The fries were excellent with a great sauce and the waldorf salad was tasty.  FIL seriously loved his scallops and the salad they came on looked very good but he doesn't eat vegetables so it sat.
My falafel plate was dry and I didn't care for the tahini sauce but the salad was quite good.  Hubs loved his pulled pork.
I really like the decor with the exposed brick and wood.  It looked like there was a great beer selection.  If we lived in the area I think we would enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"I've been to Deagan's a couple times now. It's consistently busy, but not overpacked that you have to wait. I have not tried their brunch yet, but I've heard great things about it. They have an excellent beer selection. Overall, it's a great neighborhood bar with a relaxing atmosphere. I've had their shrimp tacos, scallops and the chopped salad. The shrimp tacos were excellent with a really good guacamole on top. The scallops happened to be a special that night and were cooked perfectly. Chopped salads are my favorite type of salad and Deagan puts their own spin on theirs by adding gruyere cheese, one of my favs. They have half off bottles of wine on Mondays which is always a great deal!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday heaven
Good sized tacos. Great tasting goodness. The  shrimp taco is my first favorite and the beef brisket one is my second fav..... I urge everyone to come and try the food here. It really is great. 
The service is great and place is clean. I'm one happy customer"}
{"text":"You may have heard by now that they changed the menu a bit and this change includes my beloved chicken and waffle entree. Now it's a \"small plate\" but really, unless you're ravenous, it's enough for one. Our friendly bartender made it sound smaller however, so I backed it up with a side of grits and bacon. The grits were bare, bare bones. Not savory, not sweet. I'll be skipping those next time since I had all of about three bites before boredom set in. The bacon was good because well, it's bacon. The chicken and waffles 2.0 though, that's a big old miss. Fatty dark meat, no more cayenne butter, a decent waffle...  it went from HIGH FIVES to meh. Still a great beer list. Sorry, Deagan's. You slipped."}
{"text":"First time there. Liked the menu. Definitely a different style than what I'm used to. I'll be back for sure, just need to remember to have them hold the sariracha. 
Julia was our waitress and was spot on throughout the course of our meal. Interacted well with each of us at the table."}
{"text":"Stars: 4+

Pros: 
Serves one of the best burgers in Cleveland, hands down. Comes with sweet potato fries that are thick AND crispy (with a hint of cinnamon) = amazing. Pricing is very reasonable for the size of the burger and the amount of fries. Fish tacos are decent, but the burger meal steals the show. The atmosphere is very laid back. 

Cons: 
The wait can be a bit on the long side, especially with larger groups for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to hang out and drink beer, but the food has gone downhill considerably since opening a few years back. Average food at best. Good beer list."}
{"text":"Two words: Big Board. 

Just do it. I've had a few pretty amazing cheese and charcuterie boards over the years, but this one is badass. I even tried cheese varieties I normally don't even like and they were effing delicious. It's a bit pricey, but if you're dining with a group of people, or even just sharing it between two would pretty much cost as much as two entrees. 

And the truffle fries--I haven't had a french fry in over 2 months, so these were delicious. I think they were because they tasted like heaven, BUT I'm not sure if it's because I've been deprived for so long, either. I thoroughly enjoyed them. 

We also had great service. There was only one little issue with the bread they served us (it was rock hard) and as soon as she knew it wasn't up to snuff, she brought us out some soft and fluffy ones. Beyond that, she was super attentive despite a relatively busy Thursday night. 

Overall--it's definitely a place I'd return to for dinner and drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible and I'm not easily impressed. Only gripe is the portions are quite small for the price which is the only reason why I'm rating them 4 stars... But I'd go again just because the chicken and waffles are so darn good and that maple syrup is exquisite."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Some of my favorite menu items include: spicy shrimp tacos, chicken and waffles (chicken is boneless which I love), Mac and cheese served with a side salad that has a fantastic light dressing on it, and the calamari (rings only, no tentacles!),"}
{"text":"Had a Saturday evening dinner with friends.  Going to Deagan's was my idea based on the overwhelming positive Yelp reviews, and I was pretty pleased with the end result.  We opted to share a number of plates, so I was happy to get a taste of a number of dishes--11 to be exact:  

We started out with the Big Board ($20), a large selection of meats, cheeses, crackers, olives, spreads, nuts, fruits, and probably other things thrown in there as well.  There was a lot of food on this board, and it lasted the five of us well into the rest of the meal--a pretty good value selection.

The bacon-wrapped dates (Devils on Horseback, 3 pieces, $6) were very good.  I thought they tasted better and were better-prepared than the similar dish at Light Bistro.

The Moroccan Meatballs (2 pieces, $8) were okay--your pretty basic tapas staple.  I don't think the Wagyu Kobe beef really came through at all with the dish (nor might one expect it to when in meatball form).  

The Spicy Shrimp Tacos (2 tacos, $9) were heavenly--the avocado, corn, and cilantro came together really well with the shrimp and soft tortilla.  This was easily the best dish of the night.  

The Peking Duck Confit Mac & Cheese (bowl, $8) was a major disappointment, everyone at the table agreed.  I like Peking Duck, and I like Mac & Cheese, but this combination just did not work out.  The taste of the duck was overpowered and drowned out by the Mahon cheese.  

The lobster croquette (special, 2 pieces) was also a miss in my opinion.  It had a seafood taste about it but not something you would instantly zero-in on being lobster.

The table also had an heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella cheese salad (special, 1 plate).  I did not have any, but it looked good and had a pretty positive response from the other guests at the table.

We also shared two sides: The Pork Belly Brussel Sprouts ($5) and the Truffled Cream Corn ($5).  It was probably a mistake to try to share these smaller-portioned dishes.  I didn't get to taste enough of the brussel sprouts to give a good opinion on them.  The cream corn is also not a side that lends itself to sharing, and while the strong aroma from the truffle oil is pleasant, I can't positively say it added to the cream corn.

We closed the main portion of the meal by sharing a plate of Amish Chicken and Waffles ($17).  The cayenne butter on top of the fried chicken provided a nice background accent.  The maple syrup with Ohio blackberries was just okay, but a necessary compliment to the waffle.  For comparison's sake, I would take Deagan's version on this classic combination over South Side's similar dish.

For dessert, the table shared the Lion Stout Brownie Sundae (bowl, $7) and two scoops of Mitchell's white chocolate rocky road ice cream ($6).  I couldn't really taste where the \"Lion Stout\" portion of the brownie sundae came in, but it was still a pleasant mix of hot and cold items for dessert.

I thought the restaurant had a nice vibe, centered around the large bar in the middle of the main dining space.  I liked the touch of having Trivial Pursuit cards at ready disposal around the bar.  Service was about average.  One observation is that as more and more places use a small plates/large plates menu, restaurants (in general, not just Deagan's) need to do a better of job of being attuned to differences in serving a table sharing dishes and one following the more traditional, entree approach.  Or maybe all I'm trying to say is that a \"sharing table\" needs to be checked on more frequently by the server for switching out dirty plates, seeing if the diners want to order more food, and not necessarily bringing out all of the small plates orders at the same time.  This pace should be a little bit more uptempo, and the experience more interactive.

Overall, Deagan's gets a \"high\" three star Yelp review--if there were a 3.5 stars grade, I probably would have given it.  The Spicy Shrimp Tacos and Devils on Horseback were excellent.  Slight improvements in service and maybe 1 or 2 more solid dishes, and it would definitely reach four-star level."}
{"text":"Love this place. Taco Tuesday is great, with the duck and shrimp tacos being my favorite. The house fries and sauce are yummy. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a five star because not only is the price good, but the service and food is superb. This is my favorite brunch spot in the cleveland/lakewood area. If you guy, try the brunch burger and pear mimosa! I love how quick the service is and how clean their restaurant has been at every trip."}
{"text":"We walked in off the streets on a September night to find some of the nicest and most accommodating people in the world!

I've only been able to slurp Gerber banana custard for days and they have me an experience of a lifetime.

They suggested lobster Mac and cheese and Saliva was dripping down my chin onto my friend's lap... 

Then it came... The cheesiest and most delicious lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had! I couldn't eat the salad because of my surgery and they were happy to accommodate me and bring mash potatoes and gravy.

Highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Deagan's :
I really do like you, but i feel you can improve.

Appetizers: Exceptionally yummy, but super small portions, which makes me feel like i paid to much for too little

Small plates: I wish you had an option like flying fig where you can pick 2 or 3 for a fixed price. Also, my crab rangoons were a disapointment, kinda fishy instead of crabby, not at all what i would have expected & I will not order them ever again!

Main plates & desserts: No complaints thus far

Service: Can be hit or miss

Will i be back, at some point sure, but i am not in a rush or anything. My husband & I had a very nice dinner (kid free) to celebrate father's day, but i wish the crab rangons were better(check out pearl of the orient's-they are the king of crab rangons)!"}
{"text":"Ok, we gave this a 2nd try since new chef. Honestly, only because our cousin's birthday dinner was here. Since we new a few things to stay away from, we felt a little more prepared. Husband got the Pork Chop with Cabbage & Spaetzle... he said the pork chop was small, but tasted good with the sauce, however, the cabbage and spaetzle had no taste whatsoever. I was excited to try the spaetzle but found it soggy and bland, not very nice texture at all.  

I had the burger, because I just don't seem to be drawn to much on this menu anymore. The burger was medium as asked for in the middle and edges were charred, which i didn't like. The pretzel  bun was so hard it was inedible. The fries were good. 

Upon ordering dessert we were crushed to learn the Bacon Bar has been taken off the new menu. We got the Amaretto Cherry and Maker Mark Ice Cream White Cake/Cobble. This was confusing description and didn't know what to expect. The ice cream was good, but the white cake was also hard and I was not a fan. 

After this experience we decided we will not drive to Lakewood again to dine here..."}
{"text":"Love going for taco night and trying all their creations, as well as queso of the week! Regular menu is ok but taco menu is excellent!"}
{"text":"Really interesting menu items and great beer list. Love the pommes frites and the chicken salad. Good service too."}
{"text":"Is it fair to write a review on just a couple apps and a beer?  Well, if that place charges $3 for a two so-so deviled eggs sitting on 10 sprigs of microlettuce, I'd say fair game. The tacos were also literally buried under an avalanche of green like a salad in a tortilla. It's not quite bar food but not really great either.  I suppose I should try the charcuterie next time since I've heard raves about it."}
{"text":"I stopped in last night for taco night.  It was one of the last ones in Lakewood I haven't tried!  The prices were pretty reasonable for their \"gourmet\" tacos.  They have lots of different choices...Grilled chicken, braised beef, spicy shrimp, ahi tuna, and their special, Antelope!  I didn't try that, but the grilled chicken, beef and ahi tuna were delicious, although my boyfriend and I both agreed that the guacamole was a little overwhelming.  We also got the French fries, or \"pommes frites\" and these are something to rave about!  They are hand cut fries with shaved parmesan and a spicy mayo!  You get a huge basket and I probably could have finished that baby off by myself!  I would love to go back to try some of their small and big plates.  Their entire menu is comprised of unique combos and different kinds of foods that you don't see everywhere.  The prices are mid-range I would say but not unreasonable for what you are getting.

Their beer selection is huge!  They have dozens of dozens of beers on tap that range from abut $5 to $10.  Their liquors and wines seem to be a bit on the pricier side but that's to be expected.  

The wait was about 15-20 minutes on a Tuesday night but the bar is huge and seems to be pretty easy to squeeze into.  The whole atmosphere of the restaurant seems very laid back with a classy feel, with lot of woodwork and a tavern-like feel.  The staff is all very friendly and service was great.

I'll definitely go back to explore this menu!"}
{"text":"We walked into Melt. \"Did you want to put your name on the list?\" the hostess says with exasperation. Whoa...\"Uh, yeah, how long is the wait?\" pause...HUGE eyeroll...\"Like, an hour. Hour and a half. Hard to say.\" Having just driven over two hours from Pittsburgh and being met with this wonderful attitude, we immediately peaced out of Melt. I looked down the street and pointed. \"DEAGAN'S!\" And sorry, I have a hard time believing that even Melt's super-hyped grilled cheese sandwiches could have lived up to our perfect lunch at Deagan's. Sometimes things really do happen for a reason, right?

I really wanted the barbecue pork, but I also really wanted the pork belly brussels sprouts, and I knew I couldn't possibly devour both at lunchtime. Our waitress insisted that I absolutely NEEDED to try both, and took it upon herself to ask the kitchen to make me the barbecue pork appetizer from the dinner menu instead of the entree from the lunch menu. I've never actually liked brussels sprouts that much (it was the promise of pork belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. I guess I've just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. Least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. The barbecue pork on a jalepeño pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.

Oh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the menu. Our waitress enthusiastically brought us samples of anything we even pointed at on the menu before we could attempt to refuse them. I kind of wish it wasn't 2 in the afternoon so I could have had more than one...haha.

I will totally make a point of coming back here again."}
{"text":"Chorizo Egg Taco are the bomb
Haven't had a bad meal in five visits."}
{"text":"Where to begin, I guess let me say thank you. Lakewood did not need yet another skinny sports bar. The DKB offers more room for actual dinner seating, and a unique menu that also includes classics for the less adventurous.

The DKB is a great place for dinner or just to grab a pint."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was very impressed.  They have a menu with all of the gluten-free options highlighted, and this made it really easy for us to order.  We ordered 6 items and they were all delicious, especially the roasted asparagus.  The atmosphere was young and hip, and the service was great.  We left feeling full but healthy- the food seemed more light and simple than your usual deep-fried Ohio tavern fare.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"They seem to get it. Party of 20. No problem.
Great service, check. 
Good drinks, check.
Over cook the burgers, did not happen.
The food is very good, drinks are reasonable, just a very good example of how run bar and pub."}
{"text":"Very good food, decent service.  Thought it was a bit pricey for what you get.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try a new bakery last night, but decided to deviate from our plan when we discovered the bakery was closed.

Off to Deagan's we went!  A first for both of us.

My mouth was in Heav-en with those chicken & waffles and shrimp tacos we shared. Everything tasted fresh and amazing, and what a delightful spin the berry-maple syrup compote had on the chicken & waffle dish.  I loved the variety of small plate offerings.  The mojitos were also very nice, as was our service (thanks, Jacob!).

This is one of those times when being spontaneous pays off.  

In spades."}
{"text":"Great place that was recommended by a waiter from Melt down the street because they had a 30 minute wait. Had the Cuban sandwich and iced tea which hit the spot. The selection of beer was amazing and I wish I could have been here for the night to indulge, but had a 6 hour drive home to Chicago right after eating. Big place with TV's and nice decor. I could easily see hanging out here all night watching a game and drinking some great beers. I will be back if in Cleveland again. Great job."}
{"text":"It's always my gastropub of choice. Lobster mac n cheese hits the spot every time. Girls' night out. Sunday brunch. Weeknight dinner. This place is perfect for anytime you want food."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese and chorizo chilli were both good.  The place has a fun atmosphere and there is a parking lot right behind the restaurants.  Parking is free after 6pm and on weekends.  The menu was not terribly extensive but the both my lunch items were enjoyable.  If you are in Lakewood, this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"Deagans does it right!

When I think about how a restaurant should be....  this is it.  The menu is causal yet creative.  They update the menu regularly and specials coincide with the season.  Pumpkin gnocchi?  Yes, please!  And the food is good good food- I've seriously had half the menu.  The beer list is unmatched by any other Lakewood joint.  Taps are clean and glasses are clean.  And when I say clean- I don't mean smelling like chemicals, I mean actually clean.  Wait times are minimal yet I've never felt rushed out of a table.  The vibe is causal and friendly.  Its not a cheap date place but its a good date place.  I've probably been here 20+ times and I'm excited to go 20+ more times.

Thank you Deagans!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I really, really want to like this place.  I love the interior, it's in a good location, and the staff have always been friendly.  The problem is that it's just not that good, especially for the price range.  The food wasn't terrible or anything...I think \"lackluster\" is the best description.  The problem is that for $15 and up, lackluster isn't what I'm looking for.  I'm not sure where all the hype came from, but I wouldn't recommend sitting through the long wait time.  There's no shortage of better restaurants on this side of town.  Not a terrible place, but you could do better for less."}
{"text":"Walking into the dark ages in search of the holy grail, the brave Knights of the round table may have made a stop at Degans.  The dreary atmosphere and dark lighting is screaming for some type of Monty song but I can't think of one.  While enjoying the darkness we have a waitress ask about offing, not quite sure yet so we need a minute but as soon as she leaves the table echo arrives and asks if we are ready to orde, shoo and we begin to look at our drinks.  My wife has a hot totty, that is short for a shot of whiskey and a pit of hot water here at castle Degans so we ask about the tea and honey part.  That is resolved with a \"here yo go lady\" comment, at least it wasn't rechid wench.  

So onto the extensive 5 item menu, we decide to order and do so, not 3 seconds passed and Echo arrives asking if we are ready for our order yet....

*** puts down ancient shining device to await dinner ***


Dinner arrives and I am pleased with both the chicken and waffles along with the gouda Mack and cheese with added pulled chicken.  Overall the meal was satisfying looking past the dismal atmosphere and limited selection.  Apparently small menues make for precise cooking so I will add a star for that.  

As our new quest for the grail continues I think I will lean more towards a lighted invited environment."}
{"text":"Yowza.  Shandygaff.  Bells Oberon and ginger beer mixed together.  Instantly became a quick favorite drink.  That combined with the service makes this place four stars.   The food, I would say is a solid three.  I loved the spicy shrimp tacos and the chicken wings.  However, the other stuff I've tried was alright, but not really my favorite.  I tried their ahi tuna sliders once and they were good, but a bit dry.  They were served with the most bland pico de gallo (spelling?)  I have ever had.  I didn't finish it.  My friend had the lobster mac-n-cheese.  Again it was just alright.  A bit runny and not that much flavor.  It was served with an amazing looking side salad that came with no dressing.  Super bland.  Same with the vegetarian dish which I cannot remember because it was so unmemorable.   
Once my friend had the chicken and waffles and said they were just ok.  I thought it was a bit too sweet.
My favorite items on the menu are probably the fries and the asparagus.  I like how they do have a vegetarian dinner and vegetarian options every night.  
It's a pretty space and it's nice to see that there's almost always a crowd.  
I've never been to taco night but it is on my list to go soon."}
{"text":"Upon first glance, Deagan's seems a little douchey.

Its mostly filled with uppity white people, its always pretty loud, its not really a gastropub, and generally there's a decent wait.

HOWEVER

The staff is so nice! The food is tasty and you get it fairly quickly! There are some great beers on tap! They have a vegan/vegetarian night on Wednesdays! Even the dessert is good! Exclamation point city!

I honestly couldn't ask for much more out of a cocktail/kitchen joint. Its a tasty-good-time and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The hanger steak frites are AMAZING here, and I'm pretty sure their Brussels sprouts have done more for the vegetable than any parent ever has (i.e. they are SPECTACULAR)."}
{"text":"Deagan's used to be my favorite restaurant in Lakewood. Over the last year with changes to new head chefs, the quality has gone down yet it seems like everything now cost $2 more than before. Underwhelming menu changes! Chicken wings smothered in sauce. Fried goat cheese that is really only seared. Uninspired shrimp tacos that I could have whipped up on my own at home. Good seasonal specialty drinks and unique beer options though! The two good picks on the menu are the burger and the fish and chips. Ask for your fries extra crispy and they'll be delicious since they're thick cut. There are a couple of great bartenders and the servers tend to be competent and on the cheerful side. Hopefully they make some interesting menu changes soon!"}
{"text":"Went for Taco Tuesday last night, it was pretty good. Nice change from Merry Arts. Definitely worth trying. I would have given it five start, but two things : one, I always am a little surprised how high the bill is every time I go here, plan to spend about $40/per couple. Second thing was the margarita, white peach or plain, still small and not my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid- afternoon for a quick bite and drinks. We sat at the bar. The afternoon was beautiful and a patio or outdoor seating wasn't available here. Forced to sit inside, I was happy to see a social style layout with a four sided bar. There were TVs facing each direction although two sides were cheated with smaller screens. The service was only somewhat attentive, not extremely perceptive, but it was friendly. The bar was clean, but a bit cluttered to look at with garnishes sitting within less than an arms reach from me. The space we sat in seemed tight. As for the general environment, it was a modern spin on the classic pub style with dark woods, exposed brick and reclaimed architectural details. The restrooms were clean, which is always important. 

Deagan's is formatted as a gastro-pub. The beer selection was extensive and interesting. There were several new ones I hadn't tried before on tap. The menu was not large, but had soups, salads, sandwiches, and small plates to big plates with a variety of ingredient flavors to choose from. What we ordered was delicious. The fries were perfectly seasoned, topped with fresh parmesan and green onion and came with a spiced aioli and a ketchup. They hit the spot perfectly with my beer. My husband had the chicken legs. A generous portion of six legs came in the order. There were three sauces to choose from and it was a nice play on the typical chicken wing option at bars. He enjoyed them. The two pretty decently sized small plates along with four total drinks came to $50 before tip. I think that makes this place a nice casual stop!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss with taco Tuesdays! Fantastic some weeks, other weeks bad taco combinations. Very cheap quality tacos!"}
{"text":"What more can you say than $2-3 tacos and a great selection of beer. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. Food came out quickly, which was impressive given the place was packed out for taco Tuesday. We had the arugula salad to start and an assortment of tacos. I enjoyed the braised beef and my wife liked the ahi best, but they were all delicious. Would highly recommend for a great mid week date night or with a group, but be prepared to wait for a bit for a larger group."}
{"text":"Holy moly...what would I do without yelp?? I seriously have no stinkin' clue.

I get dumped out here once a year for a week of training for work and actually enjoy my trips out to Ohio because one of my besties is out here for school. She makes the drive over from Toledo and we try to find a good eat around town and happened to come across Deagan's on Yelp.

If you aren't familiar with the area, this is such a cute little piece of town that I like muchmuch more than Cleveland near the airport. The feel is casual, it is pretty well lit, and people are generally very VERY friendly.

Ambiance: Very reminiscent of some of my favorite bars in San Francisco. With the exposed brick wall right down to the hardwood floors. Dimly lit and very chill atmosphere..its definitely I can appreciate. Not some rambunctious crowd of drunken tourists..

Food: My friend and I got -
1. Lobster Mac and Cheese - Yummy side salad and a big bowl of lobster mac and cheese was no joke. The bowl might be deceiving because it is DENSE. They used shells which was absolutely genius since the cheese sauce was nicely wrapped up inside each shell. Found one large chunk of lobster for good measure and tons and tons of cheesy goodness..

2. Steak Frites - We had it Medium Rare and it came with two sauces;this green garlic dipping sauce and a bbq+hotsauce tasting mixture. Really good with grilled veggies and yummy fries. (how can I say no to fries?)...the chef really knew what they were doing because the meat was so tender and perfectly done.

3. Creme Brulee - this comes with some various fruit..it is one of the thicker creme brulee's that I've had and tasted more sweet than vanilla...if that makes sense.

4. Tirimisu - waaayyy too much whipped creme on the top layer. My friend and I LOVE whipped cream, but the cream was really thick and left a film in my mouth. It definitely wasn't my favorite of the night.

Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive enough. She was always asking how we were doing while we were still eating..and no where to be found when we were waiting for her. 

Still. All in all, it was a fantastic night out with good food!! I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town! :)"}
{"text":"We ate here last night and I've heard nothing but good things. I ordered the deviled eggs - they tasted fine. I was told the steak was great so I ordered that.

This is where it goes downhill...

The steak was repulsive. There is no other word. The spinach tasted rotten, so I brushed that aside. The steak was under cooked (not the medium I order), but I'm not picky so I knew I'd still like it rare. I had to spit out the first bite because it was impossible to chew let alone swallow. The next 3 bites I attempted weren't any better. I took the leftovers home and threw them away.

I didn't throw them away because they tasted bad. I threw them away because upon returning home I PROMPTLY got violently ill and stayed that way for the next 12-15 hours. 

I wouldn't suggest this place for anyone - something was wrong with the food. I do feel bad because the bartender was really nice. I'm super bummed because I only heard good things about this place..."}
{"text":"Another star down...the cheff left, the prices hit the ceiling and calamari taste like rubber...add diluted Guinness and tini-tiny portions...
Still great ambiance but too bad you can't eat it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years.   I'm not from this area.  But when we were back, I remember loving this place, so we decided to go for dinner on a Sunday evening.  

Parking-  on Sunday's and in the evening during the week, u can park in the back for free.  There is no parking in the front.  Other then that, you'll have to park down the side streets or farther down the main road I guess.  

Let's just say I was SOOOOO disappointed.  To the point I would never come back nor would I suggest it to others.  

Service- the girl that seated us, she was nice.  We had this tag team, 2 girl servers probably right about 21 yrs old.  Neither knew the 1st thing about serving.   And at least one was more pleasant while the other one was not pleasant at all and quite rude.  I ordered a hot toddy.  I was given a glass w/a shot of whisky and a little pot of hot water and a lemon.  They walk away quick.  I had to wait at least 10 minutes to get their attention so I could get the honey and tea bag!  Then she brings me the wrong tea.  When she brings me the right tea, she says \"here you go lady!\"....lets just say, I had a baseball cap on and most people think I'm in my late 20's/early 30's... Even if I was OLDER, talking to anyone like the way she did is just not right.   After we were done eating she would walk by and always look the opposite direction.  Once I tried to b a little louder and said \"excuse me\", at which point she turned to look at us and just kept walking by.... 

Food- the menu is very limited!!  We kept flipping it over, like 'this is it'.   We got the chicken & waffles since we had that before and remembered loving it, and the Mac n cheese.  The Waffles were so bland and tasteless!  The syrup and butter did not help.   The chicken was dry and bland as well.  What the heck happened!!!  Came with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts.  With salt added, they were good.   The Mac n cheese came w/a side salad w/soft greens and their house dressing.  Kinda strange to get a cold salad served on a hot dish along side Mac n cheese.  But it was ok.   The Mac n cheese was the best part of the meal.  I got a side of Sriracha sauce and it made it even better (btw, the chicken n waffles did not come w/ a hot sauce, doesn't it usually? Anyway...)....there was plenty of bacon and nice big hunks of chicken in the Mac n cheese.  This alone is not enough to make me want to ever come back tho... So sorry, I hate writing bad reviews"}
{"text":"The calamari was awesome. It was cut so thick with a sweet & savory sauce/toppings. The beer/drink menu is great, a little something for everyone. Entrees: we had the special, mahi it was delicious. I prefer to order what's ever on special or the featured entree if you will. The lunch prices are significantly less but the portions are about the same."}
{"text":"Great beer selection offering eclectic food with a chill vibe.

I was eager to see what my fellow Yelper and good friend suggested when I arrived this afternoon in Lakewood. He recommended the Melt, but the wait there was crazy and I needed food ASAP! We walked down the street and I'm VERY happy to say stumbled upon Deagan's.

Right away we stead ourselves at the bar and were greeted with beer and food menus. I immediately enjoyed the selection of yeasty beverages and the relaxed ambiance. The bartenders exemplified that easy going attitude and I had a completely relaxing and tasty experience.

A self-proclaimed wing aficionado, I had to try their soy glazed variety and decided to go full tilt on the meat + cheese selection (a.k.a., \"The Big Board\"; *see picture). I love a good cheese plate and there are a few places I have been where I've been duped out of quality selections, but this one was delish! My buddy and I picked away at it and I put away the six wings (also quite tasty) on my own.

The wingage + atmosphere + tender attitude + awesome cheese and meat plate made Deagan's Kitchen & Bar the perfect choice this evening. Next time I'm in town, I'm heading back here first!"}
{"text":"Deagan's continues to be my favorite restaurant in town. The food is delicious and inventive, and the beer list is always varied with new kegs showing up all the time. We even took some vegetarian friends to Deagan's Wednesday vegetarian night, and they loved everything they ordered. The vegan orange cake dessert was divine."}
{"text":"This has become the comfort-food default for me and my wife. I don't think we've ever had a bad dinner or dessert here. My only complaint is they replaced the hanger steak on the menu with a flat-iron steak. Still really good, but they had probably the best hanger steak on the West Side. I'm hoping they at least bring it back as the occasional special.

Also really good are the chicken & waffles, the fish & chips, the Ohio beef burger, pretty much any dessert on the menu. On Tuesdays they have awesome tacos and a continuous array of daily specials. The beer selection is also vast and constantly changing, with lots of really good seasonal and local beers available. Great decor and service here as well.

This is one of the few places where I don't mind waiting for a table, though that usually only happens on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Deagan's is a great place, just what lakewood needed. With the epic Melt wait lines of 2-3 hours, it's good to know that there's a great local place within a short walk that has (even better?) good food and plenty of good drink as well.

The atmosphere is great, odd that the waiting room is in the back, but since that's where the best parking is anyways, a sensible choice. It looks in much better shape than the last restaurant in the location I went to (barnacle bill's). Although I do wonder whatever happened to that big diving suit?

The food is fantastic, fancy rustic is what I'd call it, although I guess it lives up to the \"gastropub\" title. We split a cheese tray, which on it's own would probably be enough. It was a fantastic array that had much more than I expected. The waitress also brought extra crackers when we ran out. The mustard cheese was fantastic.

My wife had chicken and waffles (and so did I, for breakfast the next day from the leftovers), and I had the bangers and mash. Both were monster portion sizes of some of the best ever food I've had.

The beer selection was fanastic, not overwhelming like buckeye beer engine, or underwhelming like some other places. it was just right. They also had a great holiday and tap lineup.

At around $75 after tip, it's not the cheapest for two, but we were very much overindulging, so for drinks and snacks this wouldn't be a bad place at all.

Great place overall on all accounts!"}
{"text":"\"Gastro-pub?\" quivers Tony Bourdain. \"What the f* is that? For me, fancy food in a traditional old pub is about as inviting as the phrases 'hot male-on-male action' or 'free prostate exam with every drink.' \"

I tend to agree with Tony in his blanket assessment of gastro-pubs. To me, there's something lost in the overall charm of a pub by introducing artful food to the mix. Pubs are supposed to be drinking establishments first and foremost. When did overachieving gastronomy infiltrate this landscape? Generally, I am all for any movement that improves public food offerings, but as a self proclaimed \"gastro-pub\", I think Deagan's tried a tad too hard and lost focus along the way. 

For instance, Deagan's touts menu items such as the \"Prince Edward Island Mussels with fennel and saffron-tomato nage\". Really? That's a tad unrealistic and pretentious for the laid back pub atmosphere that Deagan's represents. Furthermore, I don't think the food nearly stands up to the elaborate foodie driven buzzword titles that are used to describe them in the menu. 

The menu ranges from bar snacks, small plates, charcuterie meat and cheese boards, to the more traditional large plated entrées. Overall, I like this menu concept. Upon reviewing the menu, I was even pleasantly impressed with the range of offerings and aggressively creative menu options. Everything sounded great.  Needless to say, expectations were through the roof. 

To start, we ordered a meat and cheese board of some sort. It included a pinch of what appeared to be store bought trail mix, a few crackers, none more noteworthy than Ritz, slices of apples and oranges, a variety of pitted olives, along with a disappointingly limited selection of meats and cheeses. I've had much better for the same price at Bar Cento. To compare these two charcuterie platters would actually be a disservice to the aforementioned bar on W. 25th St . 

Next we had the Moroccan Meatballs with wagyu kobe beef, spanish olives and roasted tomato along with the Amish Chicken Wings with soy chile jam and green onion. Again, the food didn't nearly live up to it's elaborate title. Neither dish was anything above mediocre in my opinion. 

Now, I don't mean to knock the place. I think it's menu is very adventurous. I think it's respectable that they offer different pub grub other than your typical fish & chips and soggy buffalo chicken wings. Perhaps I was fooled by Deagan's? Maybe it's my fault that both the \"gastro-pub\" term and the foodie driven menu descriptions seemed to have over promised and under delivered? Maybe it's all just a matter of context and expectations?  

To me, Deagan's is like the new Kanye West album. Or even the latest Hollywood blockbuster that's received a plethora of praise. Expectations are through the roof just based on all the chatter. There's no room for error at this point. Then when you finally try the new album, movie or menu, it either meets the grande expectations or not. To me, I was over promised and under delivered with Deagan's. The next time, I'd rather have the opposite."}
{"text":"Great place to have dinner and drinks with friends or a dessert and a nightcap with a date.  Menu is comfortable with a gourmet twist.  I have not been disappointed.....well except for the one time I ordered the chickpea/veggie sliders and they were burnt, but I find myself going back again and again so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Deagan's did not disappoint. Great atmosphere and decor. Friendly and professional staff! Awesome bar with a great selection of mixed drinks and beers. Our food was so tasty. We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"I want to like Deagan's so much, but it just seems to always fall short for me. The bloody mary I had there was watered down and flavorless and their sandwiches are very average. Great ambiance, though, and good service"}
{"text":"I live so close to Deagan's and yet only recently made it there. Every other time I've gone, the place has been packed with a wait of over 30 min - and no space at the bar to even cozy up for a beer. Fortunately, a friend and I made it there early during the week (5pm on a Wednesday - only a few tables taken). 

Well worth the wait! Every night they have different specials, with Wednesdays being \"vegetarian/vegan\". While the vegan options were limited, the regular menu has plenty of things for vegetarians (I'm a reformed vegetarian). The vegetarian cheese special had a goat cheese with maple syrup and figs. The waitress highly suggested it, and won applause - it is one of the best appetizers ever. My dining mate and I fought over the last bits and left the plate clean. I can't speak of other servers, but ours was attentive, funny, and had great suggestions. Never once did my water glass go empty. 

They have a good beer selection that changes regularly (while I do think that the Winking LIzard has a better selection over all, Deagan's might win for being a bit more interesting). Do try the pommes frites. I thought, \"They're fries, for like, $6??\" and rolled my eyes. My dining companion looked more serious than ever and ordered them. She was right. They are fantastic. The mac and cheese with duck confit was another winner. We may have scraped that bowl clean. The portions aren't huge, but the small plates are great for sharing and the food is wonderful, especially for bar food.

I had my back to the rest of the room, but by the time we left, it was packed to the brim. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"They used to have the greatest charcuterie board in town....and took it off the menu for some reason.  Even the wait staff is pissed about it....food is otherwise good and have a great beer list and staff."}
{"text":"The soft shell crab and rice noodle salad is top notch and so is their brunch menu. Customer service is, well, meh. They double charged me for a meal on my debit card and it took them almost an entire week to void it properly. If I stop by again I'll pay with cash."}
{"text":"Deagan's combined some of my favorite things about a neighborhood bar with a restaurant. The ambiance is nice and unpretentious, lots of chill folks enjoying drinks at the bar. Came here on Taco Tuesday, the tacos were cheap and delicious. Bartenders will offer to let you try out beer samples for free, which was a major plus if you can't decide on something. 

I would highly recommend the Chorizo taco and the pork taco. Duck taco was mediocre in my opinion."}
{"text":"Have been to Degans many times and I have never been disappointed. Fantastic cocktails and beer selection. And the food is fantastic too! I have a hard time ordering from the menu because every thing is so good! They also have have great vegetation options. That is good for my husband who is a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I really hope this place isn't haunted. In my six years in Lakewood, this is the third different bar/restaurant/gastro-whatever to be located on these premises. The last time I was here it was a Mexican place. I seem to remember a girl walking around in a Red Bull T-shirt giving people free Jello shots. For some reason, I don't remember much more after that.

That said, Deagan's, this incarnation of this place, is pretty excellent. It bills itself as a \"gastropub.\" I know \"gastro\" means food...right? And \"pub\" of course means...pub. So, like, it's a bar where you can get food? That's selling it way short. I went here on a Saturday night attempting to impress a lady with my savvy dining choices. The service was fast and friendly, and their beer selection looked off-the-hook, even though I didn't order any due to the previous night's indulgences. I got the fish and chips, which was fantastic -- perfectly fried and with a just-hot-enough-but-not-too-hot sauce on the side. My, uh, dinner companion got the Ohio Beef Burger, which got high marks. And dessert got pretty crazy -- the Pumpkin Cheesecake was the largest slice of cheesecake I've gotten outside of Manhattan. 

All in all,  Deagan's is a touch too pricey to make this a twice-a-week hangout spot, but I'm glad there's a restaurant of this caliber within stumbling distance of my tiny apartment."}
{"text":"Cool gastropub with a laid back vibe, great craft beer list and very good food.  We went over the weekend for lunch and were not disappointed. We started out with their fries which had truffle oil and were delicious.  I had the veggie curry which was very tasty although it had too many green beans.  The husband had the shrimp tacos and wings, he loved them both.  I've had the shrimp tacos before and I think they're the best in the city.  The service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a rush."}
{"text":"If you look at the reviews of this place its the service that sucks.  Not the food, not the drinks.  The service.  I heard about the happy hour and decided to give it another shot after a long time off.  Been here at least once the last few week because of the sick beers they have on.  Last time was ok  but this time I got treated like a total asshole by servers who need a few lessons in bartending and customer service.  They would rather chat with each other and gossip that wait on the people giving them money at the bar.  

Came in here today after 4.  Knew about the happy hour because of their website.  When I sat down I was given the full price food menu and never heard a mention of happy hour prices of the beers.  I ordered anyway.  Needless to say, 3 middle aged women, 2 dudes in ties and a North Face couple came in .  All were given the happy hour menu except for me.  Hearing the ladies next to me ordering off the happy hour menu I asked and was given one.  Gee thanks....  When a new girl came on to take over i ordered food from her.  Waited 30 minutes  and when I asked what was going on she said she forgot.  Had I been dressed differently would I got better service?  Would I of been served better?  Had I been a different color would I?  These people suck at customer service.  There has been many articles written about so many Cleveland restaurants opening in recent years and lack of talent.  This place has the bottom of the barrel, left-overs.  Come for happy hour and see...unless you look like you have an Audi outside..then you get the kiss ass treatment...."}
{"text":"Nothing special about Deagan's.  When we walked hit we noticed a bad odor in the restaurant, a damp type of smell. It was 8:30 pm and we had traveled all day so we figured we would stay.

Service was fine and they had a nice beer selection. The food was meh.  I got a $13 burger, which was just an average burger, nothing special. My wife had a salad which was okay, again nothing special and overpriced. 

I would avoid this place if in the area for the food but maybe stop in for a beer."}
{"text":"So familiar with the Lakewood food area but not Deagan's. Really love the service, and atmosphere. Great place for brunch. Home fries are differently made from the typical breaksfast home fries but really good."}
{"text":"I live in mayfield and I drive all the way to Lakewood for their Sunday brunch. It is so good! Mimosas, bacon, fries and happiness!"}
{"text":"I got the steak au poivre and it was horrible. Where was the au poivre??? Where are the cracked peppercorns??? There wasn't a single peppercorn. Why is it even called au poivre? There isn't any cracked peppercorns, there was no cream pan sauce. It wasn't there.

Just a lifeless steak.

4realz tho that wasn't steak au poivre"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Deagan's yet?  I've been there 87 times.  Well, not really...but I've been there pretty often.

Any restaurant that has a vegan/vegetarian night, a dedicated \"meat free\" deep fryer, and multiple vegan and vegetarian options is ok in my book.  Oh.  And I'm a fan of the Moscow Mules.

My favorite veg options are the tofu bar snack, the vegan lunchtime pasta, and the crisp eggplant.  All are pretty damn tasty.  I've also had the vegan tacos on taco Tuesday and think they're pretty amazing.  (why can't other establishments recognize that us veg heads like taco night, too?  huh?)  I had a beet salad that I thought was just ok...but I'm not the biggest fan of beets, so I think that was more my fault than the salad's.

I'm not a beer drinker, but as others have said, the offerings are extensive.  My meat-a-tarian boyfriend has been eating his way through the menu and has enjoyed everything he's tried. Sooo...I think there's a little something for everyone here.  (even brunch if you're into that kind of thing)

Glad that Deagan's is being recognized for being such a great new establishment in C-town!  And that they're so vegetarian and vegan friendly.

P.S. There are always daily specials, so be sure to check out Deagans' facebook page to see what additional options are available."}
{"text":"Deagan's is such a solid spot for me to pick when I have people in town and haven't thought of where to go. The food is always good, the atmosphere is nice without being pretentious, and I've never had an issue with the service.

It's pretty much an \"upscale sports bar\" if that makes sense. There's a bar and TVs but you also feel like you're in a nice restaurant as well - It's casual and intimate at the same time. Their draft selection is always top notch- seriously always find some obscure beer that I had years ago in *insert random state* whenever I come here. 

The menu is not your standard blah American bar menu, instead it's chef inspired and executed. In that regard it's a steal for the price but I do find Deagan's to be a bit pricier than where I normally eat (which really isn't saying much I'm quite cheap). I would like to start coming more on weeknights to check out their happy hour and daily specials. I thought they used to have a vegan night, but I may be wrong because as of October 2017 it lists the specials as Tuesday: taco night, Wednesday: B for D, and Thursday: $10 for a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Look, Deagan's, I don't think it's working out. It's not you, it's me. We just want different things, you know? I don't think I'm ready for that much commitment.

After many trips to Deagan's, I just don't know how I feel about it. The food is good. I loved their \"unicorn\" tacos (seitan with Asian-influenced veg and sauce), have enjoyed many dishes, and think the menu's accommodating. The beer and wine selections are pretty nice, and the atmosphere is pub-lite. It has a decent amount going for it... but I'm just not feeling it.

Maybe it's the forgettable waitstaff, which has never left any real impression. Or the monstrously long waits on a weekend night--or any night, for that matter. Maybe it's the hip gastropub fare of charcuterie boards and chicken livers and oysters, paired with the always glaring ESPN channels all along the bar.  All I know is this just isn't working out for me. 

I'll be by in the morning to get my stuff."}
{"text":"We had a great Friday night out here with stellar service and good food.
Two of us are vegan so we were thrilled to see the vegan coconut curry on the menu.  Falafel sliders looked like another option for us but we both went with the curry because the super friendly waitress loved it.
Good choice... Very hearty and flavorful.  Sweet potato a little undercooked but I still enjoyed the dish.  
A friend ordered the tilefish and fell in love with it.
I ordered the cucumber monitor off of the summer cocktails menu which was perfect for the 90 degree day we are having."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fun atmosphere, great service! The wings are very tasty... My husband loves the burger. I had the vegan paprikash (yum!). Two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"After a morning of studies, we decided to take a break for brunch. We heard lots of good things about their dinner menu and thought their brunch would offer equal quality. I ordered the Cleveland Benedict and was BLOWN AWAY by the mild yet flavourful chorizo and homemade pierogis. The dish comes with this AMAZING hash that is literally deep fried to perfection with strings of sautéed onions and red peppers. As a side I opted for the homemade biscuit and apple butter. The biscuit was huge and soft and light. The apple butter was not what I expected. It was fresh and spring-like, not hearty like I've come to know. It paired well with the biscuit indeed. My only complaint would be the Smucker's Honey packet that came with my hot tea.

My fiancé ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. According to him, it was equally awesome in flavour. He also loved the rosemary-sage gravy that was smothered all over it. In fact, he asked for a small side of the stuff because he felt the original portion was not enough... in true Cleveland fashion."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was amazing! Shrimp taco is delicious and they don't skimp on the shrimp...the rest of the menu looked great too and I can't wait to come back to try something new! Our server was wonderful too- very patient given we came in with two kids who weren't cooperating."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The atmosphere is always great and I LOVE their Chicken and Waffles. The burgers are just as delicious too."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the gastropub category, but Deagan's was good, if not a bit overpriced ($3 for ONE deviled egg. Really? A $48 surf and turf special, REALLY?)). I ordered the veggie burger sliders and enjoyed them. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was also good but a bit soggy/greasy. The staff was very friendly but a little disheveled. The owner was there and was interactive and involved. It was busy and seems to be well loved by the locals. I like a little more pub and a little less gatropub-hype. That being said, if our friends invite us out here again I would go."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with a wide selection. There are so many good 'Snack' and 'Small Plate' options to try that I couldn't save room for a meal, and I look forward to returning to try more.

Full beer menu and a long list of Vintage cocktails, all reasonable prices.

I only wish that I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary bar!!! But other than that nothing stuck out to me truthfully. The food I had was good, but not how I imagined the presentation would be. For instance, the fries were well fried but the truffle/parm/parsley flavoring didn't stick. Ended up with a basket full of seasoning and eating the fries plain. The baked goat cheese small plate I figured would be hot melty goodness, but ended up feeling like lukewarm block cheese. Kinda sweaty cheese too, that has been sitting out too long. My friends really did enjoy their orders though (a lunch salad and a burger)."}
{"text":"First time having dinner at Deagans. Not what I expected but surprisingly good! We decided to go on vegan/vegetarian night! The tacos were a great addition to the menu and the tufu buffalo wings were to die for! Not over priced, extremely casual, great drinks and beer selection. If your looking for a good food and not to dressy this is your place."}
{"text":"Went here with a small group and sat at the bar for a late brunch on a Sunday. Very good service and a good place to watch the game as they have big TVs all the way around the bar. I had Shrimp and Grits which was very good but also tried the special which was chorizo and cheddar sliders. Wish I had ordered those instead as they were amazing.  I would definitely return..."}
{"text":"A solid four stars. It's not perfect, but it comes close. I'll get to the nits after the well-deserved accolades. I've been here at least five times now, and it's always solid. There really is something for everyone -- the menu offers a variety of delicious meat-laden, seafood, vegetarian, and vegan fare. There are also well-made pedestrian dishes like burgers and fried fish sitting alongside some seriously ambitious fare that exceeds most gastropubs in quality and creativity. Even better is the consistently attentive and cheerful service I've encountered here. The place gets crowded, but they do well to get you in and they never seem harried or like they're rushing you through the meal. As for those little annoyances, their impressive beer list needs to be updated more often; several times I've ordered off the menu and what I want is gone. Likewise, they can be a victim of their own success, as I've experienced them running out of food more than once. Overall, however, it's a consistently good experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and choice of booze! I'm a sucker for craft beer and this place had quite a selection! The atmosphere definitely takes you back.  This place has restored plenty of its furniture, walls, and floor!! So beautiful!
 
Parking is next to a bank, and you have to pay for it so make sure you bring some cash!

Now for the food! My friend and I ordered the Devil's Eggs, Calamari, Tomato Bisque, and the Fried Egg BLT!! Every thing we ordered was great!! I didn't care that much for the Devil's Eggs though because I felt that the mustard was a bit too overpowering.  The Calamari was crunchy and delicious! They drizzled a sweet and savory sauce over the calamari which was nice but by the time our meals came out, the calamari started to become soggy.  The tomato bisque was so delicious!!! The flavor is differently rich with a creamy texture.  I ordered the soup just so I could dip my sandwich in there. which was the best decision I made during this experience!  The sandwich had a lot of flavor! The eggs were definitely seasoned perfectly so when it drizzled out of the sandwich it tasted divine!  They were not shy with the bacon, in which they made sure there was a crunch with every bite.  The lettuce and tomato were so fresh and crispy which helped put this sandwich together!  And of course how can I forget the fries! The fries were tossed in Parmesan!! The fries were perfectly seasoned that even when I was full, it was hard to stop eating it because they were that good!

Service is amazing, people are amazing, food is amazing, and overall experience was AMAZING! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone craving some good food with their craft beer!"}
{"text":"Yelp helped me find this place while I was in Cleveland on business.  Boy I wish this place was near my house.  The food is top notch.  

I was there on Taco Tuesday and  got two tacos and their Rocket Arugula salad.  The taco were great but the salad was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  With a light dressing, creamy goat cheese and these awesome sugar coated walnuts...yum!

The service was also great -- fast, efficient and friendly.

Only two small issues (definitely nothing that would keep me away) - it's so dark in the restaurant it is impossible to see anything.  I also ordered a cherry margarita that was tasty but rather weak.

Great place!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 for my guy's birthday and had a fabulous time.

The staff was so wonderful and even allowed me to bring in a homemade cake to serve for dessert. Our server even kept it a secret! 

We all enjoyed our meals. The chicken and waffles was by far the greatest hit of the group. The cayenne pepper butter and light berry syrup served with the dish is too perfect! Great flavor pairing for such a heavy dish.

My best and I shared the shrimp tacos. I have had some good seafood tacos in my day and will admit to being pretty impressed. They were light but filling, not too pricey.

Our food came out fast and the beer selection was stellar. I'd definitely go back for lunch or dinner and cannot wait to have that heavenly chicken and waffles again."}
{"text":"Appreciate the veg options (the vegan pasta bolognese was super filling and, here comes the cliche, hard to tell it was vegan) but can get pricey quick.

Blackberry whiskey lemonade was pretty delicious though."}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the drinks, loved the surroundings and loved the service.  They even had a gluten-free menu!  We started off with the fresh tomato bisque drizzled with bright green basil oil and studded with pencil-thin grilled asparagus...rich, creamy...wonderful start!  The grilled shrimp cobb salad was a top notch version of a classic...with perfectly grilled (oxymoronic-ly) huge shrimp.  The kid had the pecan-crusted chicken salad...we were both happy campers. My amaretto sour and her Moscow mule were pretty damned good, too. Nice place, nice people, nice addition to Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Nice and fun place to eat.  The menu is very creative and sensitive to various dietary needs."}
{"text":"I dig this spot in the heart of Lakewood. It's on the pricier side of what I'm looking for but they've got a killer happy hour. Definitely worth checking out. They're closed on Mondays so beware of that, but they make up for it with some pretty cool daily specials on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. 

Their Taco Tuesday offerings are delicious. A few of those and you've got yourself a pretty decent meal paired with the numerous beers they have on draft.  And the $3 happy hour is where it's at!  4-7pm on Tuesday-Friday gives you lots of time to stretch out that buzz and try lots of new beers. The $10 burger and a beer special on Thursdays is on my to-do list. 

Outside of happy hours and deals, this is also a hot date spot or a place for dinner with friends or family. It's typically crowded around dinner time, especially on weekends, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a bit! You've got lots of bars within walking distance so it makes a great start to a night out. 

And with their weekend brunch, Deagan's makes a sweet spot to follow up that night out when you wake up the next morning. Had a fritata and a mimosa at my last visit. Also had an order of their fries which are a vital hangover remedy but really they're just so delicious that I could eat them as a meal on their own!"}
{"text":"Brunch on Saturday was excellent. The Bloody Marys were delicious, as were our meals--the French Toast w/ procuitto, figs, and feta and the Biscuits and Gravy. Great decor, great service.  Eclectic menu.  Have to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I gave Deagan's 3 stars b/c of poor service. This was my first trip to Deagan's - I liked the atmosphere and the food was pretty good. But I'm not sure I'd make the drive to Lakewood (from the east side) just to go here. 

We both ordered burgers and frittes w/ parm cheese.  Hard to mess it up, the burger was nicely seasoned, and the fries with spicy mayo - you can't go wrong. 

The server was slow to take our order and when I asked a question about a menu item, she had no clue. Her response was, \"I don't pay attention to the foods I don't like but you should order it because people like it\" (I asked about  the tofu app). I asked her to find out about the dish and she didn't get back to us. In addition, didn't bring the usual condiments (even after being asked) for the burgers.

All in all, it was a good spot to meet a friend, have a beer, and relax. The food was fairly priced too - hopefully we just had a waitress that had a bad day."}
{"text":"I had relatively high expectations for this place; I usually have very low expectations for places in general. [Writing this days later, I do wonder why, maybe it was because it I had not been out in a while].  

We sat ourselves as the place was bustling [all the 20+ bar seats were taken] around 8:30p on a weeknight. Our waitress, Jillian, was bubbly, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered all of our questions about the menu. Our service was very good during our meal despite the crowd. 

Great beer selection, over 10 on draft craft beers [including 3-4 christmas ales, and bonus points for Bell's] from all over the country, and over 20 microbrew bottle selections and several Belgians. Additionally, they were reasonably priced [and I can be stingy on my beer prices]. Great lighting. There's a few televisions over the bar. The space itself is nice with exposed brick, the appropriate amount of lighting [some places I find to be too dark]. The space is also relatively large and features seating at and near the bar and also away from it. 

I only had the Duck mac and Cheese [recently moved to the app menu]: creamy with plenty of duck meat. For $8, the portion was priced well. Note the kitchen closes at 11 [at least on weekdays]. 

There's also Trivial Pursuit cards at the bar [I love this, and good fun for my friends and me, even if the cards were all older than we were]. 

Compared to other gastropubs that I've been to in the area, Deagan's was a tad cheaper and less cramped with its seating than the Taphouse. Compared to Cento, Deagan's came off as slightly less sophisticated in its atmosphere [still above a typical bar] and has TVs. 

I'll be here the next time I come out looking for food beyond typical bar food, without going out a fancier place and a good beer selection. I'm hesitant to give 5 on one visit, but here it goes."}

Deagan's did not disappoint
taco tuesday too!

Stopped in for dinner at the bar last week.  This place will see me again, and soon.  Here is my experience in a nutshell.

We chose to sit at the bar, although tables were still available.  The ubiquitos large flatscreens were scattered about.  seems like the norm now, but it also stifles conversations.  The dining room had a very mixed crowd, and it appears to be kid-friendly as well.  Nice atmosphere.  So far so good.

One very nice thing I noticed immediately is how seriouly they take their beer here.  The two lines of multiple draft beers have glass rinsers that shoot clean water into the beer glass for a final rinse to remove any residual soap and sterilizer.  The cocktail list is nicely done.  I ordered a Moscow Mule that had a non-traditional twist of fresh mint.  It was tasty.  Very tasty.  The mint takes the edge off of the ginger beer, giving it a very nice new flavor dimension.  Not a \"traditional\" Moscow Mule, (actually, no longer a Moscow Mule) but a very nicely done cocktail indeed.  The bartender was quick, pleasant, and had a contagious smile.  Obviously, she enjoys working there and it shows.

My GF ordered 3 different tacos, as it was Taco Tuesday, a popular Cleveland bar tradition of sorts.  1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 shrimp.  They were 2 or 3 bucks each, depending on the filling.  I tasted all 3, and they were all very good, with the shrimp taco being the standout.  Appetizers we had were chips and guacamole.  all fresh, flavorful and well done.  I had the crispy chicken livers which were also delicious and flawlessly prepared.  Fish and Chips was my entree of choice.  Fluke was the fish of the day.   The batter was tempura-like, the fish very mild and undoubtedly fresh.  5 good size pieces.  I couldn't finish, but I sure tried.  It was served with what I believe was a remoulade sauce as opposed to tartar sauce.  I like.

Our food was brought to us by a food runner who sort of just plopped our plates in front of us, whirled around and ran back to the kitchen before we could ask her for silverware.  Twice.  No biggie, the bartender took care of it right away, and that was the only minor glitch.  

I look forward to expolring the menu, and will do it soon.

Carry on."}
{"text":"I have gone to Deagans since it opened since my parents live right down the street. Their food is delicious and it has an amazing atmosphere where you really can feel the history of Lakewood especially since when they were renovating, they found an old painting hidden in the walls that they saved. 

We have also held two parties there, one was for my nanas 90 birthday. They have a great private room and are really flexible in whatever you would like to be offered. 

The only problem that I come across there is the fact that they rarely change up their menu. Now that I live on the east side of Cleveland I don't get there as much but even ever couple months when we do make it, it still has the same things on it usually. 

They have great service and great chef. I highly recommend Deagans's for family, a friend get together, or a romantic date."}
{"text":"First boar chop, first quail egg, first Christmas Ale of the season (Thirsty Dog's 12 Dogs of Christmas) - our first visit to Deagan's was full of excellent firsts; we'll be returning for sure.

The prices are on the high side for pub food, but it absolutely lives up to its promise - the devils on horseback were delicious, the \"ham and eggs\" special, boar chop with quail eggs was great, and the crispy chicken livers with polenta, fried shallots and pork belly were decadent and yummy.

The upscale crowd matches the food, less \"bar\" than \"pub,\" the noise level is loud but tolerable on a Friday, the wait is reasonable, and the food is totally worth waiting for - I could easily have chosen any one of half a dozen items and been just as happy.  Deagan's, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."}
{"text":"I love Deagan's! I have been here a few times now, and the food has never disappointed. They were out of the special I wanted, which was kind of a bummer, but I was able to find something else on the menu... shrimp tacos! They were just the right amount for a small plate. The bartender also told us they have \"Taco Tuesdays\", which I will definitely be attending soon! I have also had their burger and fries, which his highly recommended.

Deagan's has a great draft beer selection, and you can always count on something new being on draft. Word on the street is they have a great Moscow Muel as well.

The only thing that could be a turn off for Deagan's is they can have a long wait. The bar is first come first serve, and it is huge!! We have never had a problem finding a seat in unver 20 minutes. This place can be busy, but that is just because the food and drinks are so great."}
{"text":"This place is great! A very pleasant surprise for a traveller like me.,
I ordered a Nitro Deschutes Red Chair and the Fish (lake perch) and chips (hand cut). Outstanding in both cases. Good service too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely solid. The atmosphere is OK, service friendly, and the menu - omg - so cool. I love an interesting menu, and this was definitely one. The kind where you're between like, 10 things you want to try. I went with the old chicken n waffles and my mom got one of the salads. Very, very tasty. I wish it weren't so expensive, I'd be there all the time, but I've gotten better atmosphere and somewhat better food for lower prices. I'll definitely be back though."}
{"text":"I had been bugging my boyfriend to take me here because me coworker had told me good things about it, but he wasn't interested in going because his coworker had said not so good things about the place. One Friday night I decided to check it out with or without him---it ended up being without. I sat at the bar since I was there solo, and it took quite some time for someone to actually start serving me--- plenty of bartenders and servers walked by, and I didn't even get a, \"someone will be right with you.\"

I almost left before being served, mostly because the smell of fish was so overpowering. I really do not like any kind of seafood at all, but I think it was a bit strong for someone who is okay with eating it. I stuck it out, and ordered just a burger. It was ok. Not worth the price. I could have gotten a much better burger for the same price, maybe even cheaper, elsewhere. The biggest thing keeping me from going back to this place is the thought of that fish smell.....yuck. The service was really not that great either.

If you like seafood, I would check it out. If not, there are better places in Lakewood to check out."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now, and I've always been happy. My last visit was on a Friday night, so there was a bit of a wait. However, we were able to find a spot to stand by the bar and order drinks while looking at the menu. For two of us, we waited about 20 minutes around 630 pm. 
     The time before last that we visited was on Easter, and we came for brunch. They had a wide variety of mimosa flavors (which had me hooked) and I tried and liked quite a few! Other than that, we mostly stick to our tried and true favorite, Bells Two Hearted. 
     The food has always been excellent every time. The menu is not huge, but there seems to be something for everyone. I tried the DKB burger on my last visit and it was delicious. Especially with truffle fries ($2 surcharge but worth it!). My boyfriend got the spare rib and it was melt in your mouth good. 
     The atmosphere here is nice. You see people coming after work for happy hour, but also couples dressing up for date night. It's very comfortable and definitely a place I plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"Service has been steadily declining since it first opened. The menu changes have gone from great to bad to good as well. Definitely hope Deagans can return to be a premiere lakewood spot."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 6/17/12: 
Almost a year has passed since I wrote the review below, and I'm sad to say that I've had to downgrade Deagans to 3 stars instead of 5. They're just too overpriced for what they are. I've been to many other places in the lakewood, tremont, and shoreway areas, and almost all of them offer the same high quality that Deagan's does, sourced from local farms and markets, and NONE of them have come remotely close to matching Deagan's in terms of price. My feelings about Deagan's can be summed up as such: Why pay $10 for corned beef hash and eggs when you can pay 7.50 for almost the exact same dish at a restaurant not much farther down the road? I love you Deagan's, but from afar, and will probably continue doing so for the foreseeable future.

We love Deagan's. My fiance and I would eat there every night if our wallets and waistlines could afford it! We try to make it here at least every other Tuesday for tacos, but you can also find us for Sunday brunch as well.

The wait staff are always friendly and professional no matter who you get, but we have two regular waitresses that we love and ask for them by name every time we come here - Abby and Lauren. And the owner himself, Deagan, personally greets the customers when he's not running around helping out his staff - something that is very refreshing to see and earns top points in my book.

The food has always been served fresh and fast. Our favorites are the pommes frites, olives and peppadews (also get goat cheese from the charcuterie board, and stuff the peppadews with it, NOM!!!!!!), lion stout brownie, amish chicken and waffles, spicy shrimp tacos, grilled chicken tacos, and braised beef tacos. I really want to try the devils on horseback and crisp chicken livers. Also, the Day oysters are very good, but overpriced for what they are (2.75/ea? PRICY). Incidentally this brings me to my next point: Deagan's is a little overpriced when it comes to food, with the exception being taco tuesday where you can get AMAZING tacos for $2/ea. I think the reason for this is that every single one of their dishes is prepared fresh, from scratch, with local ingredients as long as they can get them. With this in mind I expect the food to be a little pricey, so it does not bother me too much. I see a lot of hate being thrown around not just for Deagan's pricing, but similar restaurants as well, so the old adage applies here: you get what you pay for. You're going to spend the same amount at Applebees or Fridays, so why not get something fresh instead of deep frozen and trucked in from who-knows-where?

The beer selection at Deagan's is AWESOME. I've recently decided that bottles ruin beer, so the fact that they have 24 handles and rotate them fairly frequently is a huge thumbs up! I have not been to another establishment with this many craft-brew taps. There's always something tasty to try. 

And finally, my review would not be complete if I didn't mention that their chef is an artist, not to mention a guy I would totally hang out and down a couple cold ones with. The things he can do with food.... OMG. We just went to their first beer pairing dinner featuring Brewery Ommegang, and the dishes BY FAR stole the show. Duck confit nachos, Mushroom and Mahon cheese strudel with micro red-ribbon sorrel and garlic chive oil just to name two. They were the most delicious things I have ever tasted. Deagan's is one of the best places, if not the best, we've been to, and we'll keep coming back week after week."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. It is hard for me to review because some stuff was amazing, while other stuff was dissapointing.

First off, the bar area is nice for drinks and food. It's a cool place to hang out but none of the drinks are amazing. (Mixed drinks/cocktails i mean). Melt bar and grill has way better drinks if that is what you are in to. 

The burgers and grilled cheese are boring. 

The chicken taco on taco night is great. The desserts are great and the brunch menu is pretty delicious. I'm glad i have had the opportunity to try so many things from here via takeout."}
{"text":"We are ever so disappointed in what Deagan's has devolved into over the past few years. This place used to be amazing, now it's horrible. 

We went last night for my husband's birthday. It was half price wine night, but the waitress told us that the bottle we ordered could not be 1/2 price because it would be below state minimum. Fine, then don't call it 1/2 price wine night. 

All in all, our waitress was wonderful and attentive, it was the ambiance and food that completely missed the mark. First, the banquet I was seated upon had a cushion that was not attached to the seat. It was clearly broken. Second, the restaurant was overrun with fruit flies. Nothing less appetizing than swatting fruit flies away from your food. Gross. 

And the food. My daughters were both served overcooked inedible food. The chicken fingers were burnt and spikey. The burger was like a hockey puck. 

My husband had a 1/2 chicken that came with no breast or at least it was less than a \"a\" cup, which it seemed like they tried to make up for by giving him a slab or corn bread as big as the chicken. My short ribs were tragic, covered in something akin to cherry jelly. The Swiss chard was great but it was sitting in a pool of sickeningly sweet goo. All around a poorly conceived dish. Short ribs are NOT a dessert. 

We used to love this place but it's a dirty disaster now."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch the other Saturday.  I was blown away; it was so freaking good!!  We ordered the chicken and waffles, ricotta fritters and fresh fruit.  Everything was delicious.  Definitely going back for brunch again very soon!  And if brunch was that good, I'm looking forward to trying dinner!"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger, with the truffle oil fries.  It was excellent.  Service was very good but slow.  The waitress was wonderful, though.  It took a long time to get our food.  The small plates are quite expensive-only two scallops for $12.00?  My friend was not that impressed.  
This place has good food, but the price tag is a bit high.  Also-it's so loud you can't hear your table mates talk!  :). Overall, it's a nice place-beats winking lizard or melt in my eyes by far."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. First time was shortly after opening, second was just a couple weeks ago. This place is the real deal and is not having a 'sophomore slump' like some new places do. 

Most recently, a friend and I shared one of the cheese boards and 3 of the small plates. 

1. Cheese board - excellent. Mahon, Red Dragon, and Saint-Andre cheeses - all really good. I found the amount of cheese to be totally adequate, unlike one other reviewer - maybe they've improved lately but there were MORE than enough to use up all of the provided crackers and then some (we asked for more and they happily obliged with more crackers). I found it to be an adequate amount of cheese for the 12 bucks we paid.

2. Small plate #1 - spicy shrimp tacos: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They weren't honestly very spicy but they were SO good that we didn't care. Perfectly cooked shrimp, a yummy zippy sauce and the freshest of fresh ingredients. OMG my mouth is watering right now just thinking about them. You only get 2 tacos for 9 bucks which is a little steep but I'd pay it again and again.

3. Small plate #2 - Moroccan meatballs - These were very good. Flavorful and well cooked (I hate it when meatballs are kinda crunchy almost on the outside and spongy on the inside) These were uniform in texture and very good. I wouldn't rave about them (see point #2) but they were very good.

4. Small plate #3 - Peking duck confit mac and cheese - This stuff was the BOMB! Very rich so it's good for sharing. Noodles cooked perfectly, english peas were crunchy (as they are supposed to be) and the duck was so flavorful. This dish totally works with these ingredients together. YUM!

5. Beer selection - Fantastic! The bar is huge and there's lots of seating.

Overall - this place is great. I don't generally like the term 'gastropub' but I think if anything fits the bill, it's this place. Great beer selection, really good food. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few different times and it's the same every time. Just average. The food is ok, the service is ok, the beer list is ok. The building itself and decor is actually really cool but ever else is just average. I did go there for brunch once awhile back because I had my heart set on chicken and waffles and the waffle machine was broken so they were offering chicken and pancakes instead... not the same. It's just ok."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! Very nice farm to table restaurant. They have great cocktails and great food.  All of the flavor profiles are unique and well done.  I would go here every day of the week! I can't say enough positive things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Still one of our very favorite places to grab something on the light side or a complete dinner. Tonight it was a burger and salad for me and a salad and Devils on Horseback (dates, haloumi, bacon, watercress, chiles) for my stupendously better half. Everything was fresh, perfectly cooked, well-presented by our server and exactly what we were in the mood for. Then, again, that's been the case each and every time we've eaten here.  I'm sure we'll get a clunker eventually because PC (perfect consistency) is almost impossible. And, when (dare I say \"if?\") that happens I promise to not come here and whine about it."}
{"text":"Anyone who wants to go to a friendly-but-higher class restaurant in Lakewood, I always direct them to Deagans.  So when my date and I decided that Melt would be too long of a wait, we crossed the street and walked right in. No wait on a Sunday night, I'll take it! We were greeted right away and seated. Our waitress was prompt and handled Chris and I pretty well, we can be a hand full. He ordered a Bells Chrismas Ale and of course I got my usual, a Moscow Mule. Their mules come in these really cute little mugs, I want a bunch of em. Our waitress came right back and he ordered a burger, myself the veggie sliders, and frites to split. Chris pretty much ordered it with its heart still beating, and that's how he got it. My veggie sliders were better than expected. For some reason I wanted something kind of healthy, because it is the week of thanksgiving, but oh  well. I love food. And it shows. Anyways, we gobbled up our food and I had one more Mule and we stayed past our welcome but weren't pressured to leave. Oh, and I got a discount for being \"in the industry\"! Amazing! What a great date night!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is good.  Stay away from the small plates and cheese boards..bit overpriced.  Their entrees are OK but portions are way small.  What really grinds my gears about this place - the beer selection is awesome but half the time you try and order something you get \"ohhh they're changing the keg...or we seem to be out of that right now\".  I want to like this place but wtf Deagans..."}
{"text":"I wrote a previous review on this restaurant back in Dec 2016 to chronicle an excellent date night I had with my husband here. I just had to write another review because this past Saturday, I hosted my son's 1st communion brunch here.  I chose Deagan's because it's really nice family friendly environment, the brunch menu sounded awesome and the prices were ok and that's in addition to my previous wonderful experience here.  

Setting a reservation was no problem and they allowed me to bring my son's cake.  My party and I arrived for our 11:30am reservation and were seated immediately.  Our waitress greeted us right away, took our food orders and answered questions we had about some of the dishes.  My husband and his parents were excited about the Bloody mary bar.  There is a buffet of ingredients to make your own custom drink and it was a hit!  I had the pineapple mimosa - delicious! Then the food came out... my father in law and a friend rdered the chicken fried steak and it was a sizable portion (I wish I took pictures) - well worth the cost of the dish and it was beautifully presented.  He kept raving about how good it was and how he could barely finish the plate because it was so much food!  He said, \"I'm curious to see what the dinner menu looks like if the brunch menu is this good!\"

I had the PBLT (pork belly) which was delicious although it came with a runny egg when it was advertised as a fried egg, but not that big of a deal for me.  The pork belly was cooked perfectly, moist and Deagan's has the best home fries I've ever tasted - it's not what I am use to at all - the potatoes were crisp and slightly chunky unlike common home fries which are more \"shredded\" like and only crisp on the very top layer.  My husband had the lobster dish and loved it and my mother in law had the frittata and commented on how good it was.  My son had apple pancakes but didn't like the caramel sauce but our waitress was very understanding and got him another stack of pancakes.  Everyone was more than satisfied with their food and kept saying how nice the restaurant was.  It wasn't busy at all for a Saturday brunch hour.

I also want to say the service was excellent! Our waitress (I can't remember her name unfortunately with everything going on) came to check on us frequently and offered to place my son's cake in their cooler until we were ready for it.  When it was time, she brought out extra plates, forks and napkins as well as a cutting knife.  We all felt more than welcome.  I am so glad my family had a good time.

I hate planning events lol but Deagan's made it so easy (they even called me the day before to confirm the reservation details).  I would definitely host another event here.  Thank you to the staff!"}
{"text":"Used to be a place with great food.  Recent trip there was around happy hour.  Food was not fresh.  Fries were lukewarm at best.  Everything tasted like it was sitting around several hours--left over from lunch service.  Disappointed.  If you wouldn't serve that quality of food to your friends and family, don't do it!!!"}
{"text":"What a delightful place!!! I know that I fall into a well-defined niche of folks who want the neighborhood pub atmosphere while eating something more artful than typical bar food. That being said, I'm a fan. The wait staff was friendly, eager and helpful. The tomato bisque was the perfect comfort food on a cold day and the fish and chips was just a little above average. I'm anxious to sample other things on the menu to really appreciate what they have to offer."}
{"text":"My original opinion was Deagans is consistently inconsistent. Well good news, that has improved.... now they are just consistently bad. 

First several visits were good, some better than others.  Service was either great or tolerable, and food either prepared amazingly or just fine.  Never left with a bad taste in my mouth. Thought since this place is just starting out they are bound to get better. With it's charming decor and intriguing menu and this could turn in to THEE place to be! (not to be confused with The Palce To Be Diner across the street) I find I'm usually wrong though. 

Next visit we were seated in the mini room on the west side of the restaurant. Actually is a very nice area to sit as it's more private and out of the way. Nice and quiet....Hardly saw anyone, not even our server. Actual saw the runner more, can I leave her the tip?

Visit after that ordered a Big Board. Was supposed to come with nuts. Came with exactly 2. Hardy Hah Hah, funny,....what am I suppose to say to complain about this?..... \"server I only have 2 nuts?\"

Finally did Bruch. After about 30 minutes and half the food came out cold. Server claimed there was a party which backed up the kitchen. Not sure about that excuse for cold food, but I digress. Waited another 20 minutes. Not even comped for anything and charge the full price. BTW brunch here is taking mundane ingredients, presenting them nice, and upping the change drastically. \"Excuse me sir, that was a spot of fruit in the $12 French toast- not truffle or lobster.\" 

Oh I love thee Ahi tuna taco's and chicken and waffles, but for borderline upscale prices I expect at least borderline upscale food prep and service. 

Will try the new menu and give it one more shot."}
{"text":"Our server as attentive, and nice. I had a Moscow Mule to drink which was really good. I was eating with a friend, and we shared everything. The caprese salad was nothing to write home about. I will say the devils on horseback were to die for. If you go you have to try them. Be warned their calamari was TERRIBLE. It was rubbery, tough, cold, and practically inedible. I sent it back, and just got a warm version of the same bad calamari. I honestly wish I would have sent the second one back, and just stayed hungry."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch: Food was good but not worth the price. The wife and I spent $45(with tip) for a cup of tea, 1 lrg waffle, side of bacon, 2 egg with corned beef hash and the donut appetizer.
2 donuts for $6. I was pumped with anticipation, only to be let down. Cold, flavorless cake donuts dipped in a tart raspberry glaze. I wouldn't  eat them again if they were free."}
{"text":"A great gastropub right in the heart of Lakewood. The small plates are shareable and the meat/cheese boards are usually high quality and excellent combinations. Wine, beer and cocktails are always reasonably priced and sometimes creative for the holidays. The corn fritters and truffle fries are our favorites, as are the pirogues and deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Deagan's is awesome. This is a bar that I can stop up and grab a bite & beer by myself, with friends, or with my entire family (small children included). The food is high quality, with unique combinations that just seem to work. I always order the shrimp tacos, with their tasty mayo sauce and whole cilantro sprigs. My girlfriend loves the stuffed breaded eggplant. My dad loves the fish & chips (they offer a different kind of fish every time and it's still consistently delicious), and the varying selection of desserts is always a hit. Probably my favorite place in Lakewood, and my second favorite gastropub after the Greenhouse. 

And Mandy the bartender is great. Takes good care of us, is always armed with suggestions, and even remembers our faces when we walk in."}
{"text":"This is one of the greatest places on the west side. If you haven't tried this place yet you should. Probably the best burger I've had in a long time, plus the beer selection is excellent! The price are fair for the quality of food you get, maybe even a bargain."}
{"text":"Nice addition to Lakewood. Just down the street from Melt, so it may alleviate some of the long waits that West Siders have become accustomed to. Good beer selection (bottled and draught). Gastropub style food. Comfortable setting. Great for groups. Deagan himself is one of the bests hosts you could ask for. One drawback... I am an East Sider."}
{"text":"I have been to Deagan's several times since my first visit, and my experience has only gotten better.  The staff has been absolutely phenomenal every time we have attended the establishment.  I came with a large group a few weeks ago, and they didn't bat an eye trying to accomodate us.  Our group kept getting bigger, and they kept offering us better and better tables that we could fit at.  There was no frustration at all; very impressive.  One of the owners even came over and talked to us for a while.  He was a great guy.

Also, they currently have 6 varieties of Christmas brews on tap.  Done and done."}
{"text":"Can't say this is somewhere I'd go again. Although I enjoyed the decor, our waitress was beautiful & very friendly, and the place was clean...I can't say the same about my meal.

 My mom kept raving about their homemade fries with truffle oil, Parmesan cheese, & spicy mayo sauce- I thought the mayo sauce was gross & the fries weren't anywhere near as delicious as they were made out to be. I also got their duck mac-n-cheese, I LOVE cheese but the smell of it was such a turn off that I didn't want to even try it. Sadly, when I did, it tasted as bad as it smelled. My sister thought I was just being too picky but also rejected the dish after just one bite. 

My mothers fish & chips were undercooked and even my cranberry juice was watered down :/ Can't say the prices impressed me either, not very budget friendly. But our waitress was nice enough to take my mac-n-cheese off of our receipt & gave me a free desert of my choice! At least the vanilla creme brulee was awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service during lunch. Their sandwich special today was fabulous and we will definitely come back! I highly recommend this gastro pub!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Deagan's on a Sunday evening to have dinner with friends. Our server was terrible. She wasn't overtly rude, but her attitude really put me off. I wasn't feeling like a drink so I had only water, and she practically rolled her eyes at me. Since we were catching up with our dining companions we weren't ready to order when she arrived the first time. This must have really gotten up her nose, since the next time she came around she asked, \"Well do you know what you're going to eat yet?\" My husband ordered a beer on tap, and never got it. When the server came around about 15 minutes later to take another table's order, she told him \"They have to change the keg.\" Then our food came, one dish at a time, and my appetizer came at the same time as my entree, and I was the last one to get any food. About ten minutes later the server came by again to tell my husband, \"I guess they're out. Do you want something else? We have [the beer] in a bottle.\" He took the bottle and she was quick about bringing it, but we were already really annoyed by that point.

About our food: I had the maple soaked dates with humbolt fog cheese for an appetizer, and it was delicious. Amazing, even. For my entree I had cheddar pierogies that were a special, and my husband got the lump crab mac 'n' cheese. Both entrees were underwhelming. Mine was a meager portion of two greasy pierogi with a tasty sour cream, his was pretty bland with only three pieces of stringy crab. He hated the salad, too. At least his beer was great?

I'm pretty sad about this disappointing experience, because we'd heard and read so many good things about Deagan's. Since the point of our meal was to hang with friends, we aren't too torn up about this blah meal, but if this was one of our date outings we might have left a crappy tip to show our ire. We've had better meals for that price range, and much better service elsewhere. My husband and I might go back one day, but maybe after we exhaust all other options in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Try the Morracn meatballs.  While you wait, snack on the beer board. Staff is great."}
{"text":"I love Deagan's. I do. I really do. The atmosphere is cozy and festive. The shrimp tacos and house fries are my standbys. The fries are sometimes good and sometimes great, and the spicy dipping sauce they come with is to die for. The beer list is amazing and the cocktails are great. The prices are mid-level, so it's not a cheap dive you can go to every week, but rather a treat when you do. Try it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I've come here twice- both on Taco Tuesdays.

Although Deagan's is a cool, hip place to go, I just wasn't impressed that much by the food. To me, I thought the tacos were a tad overprice for what you get- there's not much stuffing to those tacos (yes, I've had them all- alligator, duck, shrimp, braised beef, etc), and just hasn't really been that crazy impressed by them?

The latter time, I ordered the same tacos- and felt the same. Although we were seating quickly for a table of 4, and yes, the service was quite good (kudos!), I've just never been that impressed. We ordered the devils on horseback just to try...and I wasn't impressed. Our Michigan friends weren't too impressed either.... 

Maybe I need to come back for the actual burger, like the other reviews have had....?"}
{"text":"I didn't have a meal here - we just stopped in after dinner at MELT to watch the Buckeyes advance to the Final Four - but I wanted to give Deagan's kudos on my dessert.

I had apple crisp, with perfectly ripe apples, delicious vanilla ice cream, and incredible brown sugar crumbles, along with equally yummy blueberries and blackberries. Everything about this dessert hit on all cylinders - and the portion was easily big enough for two people, maybe three. 

(Side note: I saw a few meat and cheese boards get served near to me at the bar. The appearance alone sold me on perceived quality of ingredients and level of taste.)

Hands down, I would definitely eat dessert here again. And, based on the quality of the dessert, I would absolutely, without question, try the food."}
{"text":"Very hipster!

It is a bit pricey but I get what I paid for! We tried many things on the menu, from the short rib nacho, to mussels, wasabi calamari, to fried chicken and waffle, salmon, and house fries and I have to say I loved everything we ordered. My favorite is the wasabi calamari. You just have to try it. It's not exactly what I expected it to be but it was a very pleasant surprise. My friends also liked the short rib nacho and the mussels. I would also recommend the house fries!"}
{"text":"What a great little place this was. I don't know if I'd categorize it as a gastropub--probably cause that bar is huge. It's more of just a \"pub\". Either way they have a full bar, robust beer choices (and by robust I mean not Bud Light kind of garbage) and standard wine choices, but a great menu that you wouldn't expect at a standard bar. 

Went with a group and ordered various items. I had a vegetarian chile relleno (I know! In a Cleveland pub!!)--very tasty although I guess I would have preferred non-veggie. Chicken and waffles looked rich and amazing. It was definitely passed around the table. The quinoa salad looked great and I heard the lobster mac and cheese was amazing.

Was impressed to see they have a gluten free night on Wednesdays. Also - kudos to the staff for fitting in 8 people without a reservation during a busy period. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I have gone to Degans several times with friends and enjoyed the food but I went here a few months ago and had a terrible experience. While the food was good and consistent I paid the bill and forgot my credit card. I drove home (30 mins) and realized I had left it. I called and spoke to my waiter and he said he had the card. I drove back in a snowstorm to get it and tipped him an extra $5 for being honest. Two days later I had someone try to use my credit card for online purchases, coincidence? I think not. I am not sure who at the restaurant did this but I view them as dishonest people and they have lost a customer over the incident. I say do not take your chance with this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was late for lunch, and we hadn't eaten breakfast.  Hunger pangs set in.  Hey, we're in Lakewood why don't we see if that place that shall not be named has less than a three hour wait for greezy bread and cheese.  No such luck.

Or maybe it was excellent luck.  We stopped into Deagans and were met by a smiling bartender, a very nice hostess and an immediate opportunity to sit down and eat.  How refreshing!

Lunch was fantastic.  We were treated to the, lightest, crispiest, most delicious battered cod I think I've ever eaten.  We also had the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo-- excellent for a freezing, awful March day.  The soup was thick and rich and perfectly balanced.  It suffered from none of the unusual tomato bisque errors-- excessive garlic or too high an acidity.  The grilled cheese was buttery and crisp and not at all greasy.  (Take that!)

The place looks great-- big bar area, exposed brick, open and airy.  The staff is really nice.  AND I didn't even have to get a tattoo."}
{"text":"The days off around the Thanksgiving holiday finally allowed for an opportunity to get to Deagan's.   Some friends had been there multiple times since it opened and had given it pretty rave reviews, so the expectations were very high. 

I'm glad to say they were met, and then some.  

Stopping in for lunch, shortly after they opened, the wife and I were quickly seated by a very friendly server.  Drink orders taken and menus in hand, we looked over the offerings, as well as the surroundings.  

While originally spurred to come in for the daily lunch specials (they post these online) we both ended up ordering off of the regular menu - that was difficult enough as most of it looked REALLY good. 

I have to give the owners some serious credit for the decor and atmosphere.  They stripped off all of the sports bar detritus than had amassed over the years, and went with exposed brick, repurposed barn siding, and tasteful art (provided by the Pop Shop Gallery apparently).  The back of the menu recounts both the story of the concept, as well as a mystery mural that was uncovered during renovations.  The end result is a very cozy and inviting environment that reminds me of the very best pubs you would find abroad.  It really feels like a great place to meet some friends and have some drinks and some good times.

Then there was the food.  The Duck confit macaroni and cheese was as good as I hoped it might be.  Rich, creamy (with a baked crust on top) and chock full of flavorful, tender duck breast.  The wife ordered the burger, which she thought might be her new favorite in town.  I wouldn't make that assertion, but I did think it was very good. The accompanying fries were perfectly cooked, and all of the sauces (made in house) were delicious.  

I've heard great things about the beer selection, but while I can't speak to that with any authority, the selection certainly seemed extensive. 

The food is a little bit pricy for the average bar food, but in light of the quality, I can't say it's not deserved.  We're both really looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for years for the shrimp tacos and the fries! One of my absolute favorite dinner spots. Great eating at the bar or at a table."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch! Absolutely love the bloody mary bar! Our favorite menu items are the huevos rancheros, chicken and waffles, and the cheesy grits are a must! Excellent service and the staff are fantastic."}
{"text":"Deagan's was among one of the first establishments in Lakewood that we fell in love with shortly after moving here.  They have a small but varied menu, so you know everything they make is good.

DO NOT SKIP OUT ON DESSERT - you will regret it.  These desserts are top notch.  Sometimes we come out just to get dessert after cooking our meal at home."}
{"text":"The menu is interesting here however, don't get the Mac and cheese .. it's a rip off- a large portion is $20. You can make a better version for under $6. It's good but not $20 good."}
{"text":"This place truly is a Gem.  The epitome of a well-ran family business.  They have a knack for blending high end food with a casual atmosphere that makes it perfect for any day of the week.  My wife and I were dining on a Wednesday night after visiting the Rock n Roll hall of fame(we are from Detroit).  The restaurant was full with a wait.  The crowd was diverse; young professionals, families, older couples.  We were seated quickly and promptly greeted by our server.  
                          Our server was very knowledgeable of the beer menu which was extensive.  We ordered our beers and some bar snacks.  For dinner, I had the Moroccan spiced lamb stew and my wife had a burger.  My stew was one of the best dishes I have ever had at any restaurant anywhere.  Yes.  That good.  My wife's burger was cooked perfectly and served on a handmade roll with some stellar, hand-cut fries.  The staff were plentiful and they worked well as a team.  We need one of these in Detroit!!  Great Job!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is delicious! 

Chorizo and egg tacos with hot sauce? I'm sold. They were just as good as they sound (though I could have had more than two, so I'm glad I ordered a side of home fries!) and definitely worth the trip to Lakewood.  My dining partner had the chicken and waffles and didn't stop eating them to speak a single word during our entire brunch - so I'm assuming they were equally as delicious.

They have a bloody mary bar and flavored mimosas during Sunday brunch - I tried the pear mimosa and it was very tasty!

I like the open, airy, laid back atmosphere and it seems very family friendly.   We didn't have to wait for a table, which is nice - I hate deciding I want to go out for brunch and having to wait an hour!

The dinner menu looks fantastic - we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My Mom just got back from England today. I couldn't think of anywhere to go for her \"Welcome Back\" dinner. My brother kept telling me how good the tacos were on Taco Tuesday at Deagan's. I figured that since it is right up the street, we may as well check it out. The restaurant was packed so we sat at the bar. Mom and I split the Eggplant filled with ricotta. Lakewood is a great place to live and Deagan's is an awesome addition. I am glad it replaced Barnacle Bills, Crazy Rita's and Cleats. The location wasn't doing too well until they came. Very similar to the old doomed location of Titanic or Martini's or whatever the hell was where Beer Engine is. If only White Door Saloon was back and kicked out Melt. That new sign is beyond obnoxious. Either way, I am glad Lakewoodites are keeping their money in the city and not driving to Longhorn or Outback."}
{"text":"We go here often and it's always a good time. The food is excellent especially brunch. They have a very good beer selection and the bartenders are always doing an awesome job. Taco Tuesday is also a winner."}
{"text":"The first couple of times I went to Deagan's were back when it first opened. Strictly for drinks. Despite being blocks from my house, I had never made the effort to go eat there in the ensuing years. I remembered the chic decor, the gastropolitan ambiance, the people my age. The wife and I were hosting an out of town yelper last week and our choices(as dictated by me) were the county fair or Deagan's. Should have gone with the fair. I would have saved myself fifty bucks and encountered more intelligent patrons.

Maybe it was because we went early in the evening(7ish), but the place came off like a hunting lodge Chuck E. Cheese. Kids, old people, tweens, twolds....Sorry, but there's a reason I avoid TGIFridays, Buca di Barfo and all breakfast spots: I fucking hate children. Simple as that. So I figured that this hip \"kitchen\" was the same place where I had savored adult beverages before. Whatever. 

Once they lowered the lights per my psychic request and some of the families cleared out, I got down to the business of noshing. The special vegan menu was of particular interest to my still veg wife. She had sliders. Our yelper abroad had the fish and chips. I had bacon wrapped scallops and a broccoli bisque with two gins and tonic. The gals split a lemon bar. Grand total: somewhere around a day's pay for yours truly. Yikes. A little north of what I expected. The flavors? Bisque was creamy and vibrant, scallops had just the right amount of bounce and came served atop a zippy puree of something or other. But will I remember any of it as one of the best meals I've had in Lakewood? No. I do have to say that the short commute to such a big name place will eventually draw me back in. I'll just go later and less hungry. Or richer."}
{"text":"Well, they were open and serving beer on new years eve at 2:30. Plus I ran into an old college classmate by chance .. not crowded and didn't have the food ..

5 stars for beering up the crew"}
{"text":"I had been here before for Taco Tuesday but wanted to give brunch a try. I found the menu pretty limited in general, but particularly if you're looking for healthy options or don't like southern themed options. I got the Huevos Rancheros which was fried eggs on top of black bean & corn salsa, hash, and chimichurri sauce ($11). It was good, and the presentation was better than I expected, but it was nothing to write home about in my opinion. Our server was great, there was no wait for a table and the kitchen service was fast as well."}
{"text":"I've loved Deagan's since the place opened years ago. The inside is the style that I love -- the mismatch chairs and tables make the place comfortable and homey . Everything on the menu is amazing. It's a great spot in Lakewood. Lately, my boyfriend and I have been taking advantage of their Thursday burger nights. I call it an adult happy meal-- burger, fries and a beer for $10. You cannot beat it. Plus their DKB Burger is burger perfection!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Deagan's for brunch last weekend.  I had the chicken and waffles - delicious.  The paprika butter and fruit syrup is a great combination.  From what I tried of my wife's and my friends' plates, everything else seems to be on par.  Service was fast, though we were among the first to arrive for brunch that morning.  It's a bit pricey, but I'd consider going back for their dinner menu sometime."}
{"text":"Warm & cozy, and always buzzing. 

I recommend sitting at the bar - it's the best place to be and the bartenders always rock. 

I've had most of the menu, including the desserts and love all of it. Must haves are the wings, fries, chicken & waffles, and calamari. Oh and the charcuterie boards.

Their Moscow Mule is by far my favorite mule in CLE and I'm a pretty giant mule fan.

My only complaint is that they close too early! I wanna spend my entire evening here!!"}
{"text":"Solid, but with more potential than actual precision.  Definitely worth checking out though. A high 3.5 stars, so I'm rounding up.

Went for a Christmas Eve meal, and there was no wait.  Well, sort of.  When you walk in, you're directed to the middle of the restaurant to see the hostess and wait for a table.  Which is awkward, because you're literally in the middle of the place, just waiting...  And, for whatever reason, it took a solid five or so minutes before the hostess seated us at one of the score of empty tables.

We sat at one of the booths in the back, and I was worried that we wouldn't have a view of the Browns game, but you can see one of the many flat-screen tvs from almost anywhere in the restaurant.  That, in contrast with the \"waiting area,\" speaks to a good layout.

Didn't order anything to drink, but wanted to check out the beer list.  I was expecting more Ohio offerings, but it was otherwise pretty solid.

We started out with two \"small plates\": Pepper-Crusted Rare Tuna and Seared Scallops.  The tuna came out with four large slices of rare tuna, each with a healthy coating of cracked black pepper on the seared outside of the fish.  Very generous portion, and it was good, though a bit underseasoned (notwithstanding the intense seasoning on the outside of the fish).  The puttanesca relish and basil that came with the tuna added an additional bit of tang.  I love raw tuna, so I liked this dish, but it would have been a little too \"one-note\" (the saltiness of the olives in the puttanesca with the sharpness of the pepper-crusting on the tuna) if we hadn't ordered the scallops, which were even more one-note.

The scallops were very well cooked, intensely sweet, and came with a shaved brussel sprouts, grapefruit and pomegranate salad.  Interesting combination of flavors, but not a huge fan of sweet on sweet.  That said, the scallops complemented the tuna quite well, so it was an (inadvertently) good pairing.

For mains, we ordered fish & chips and the special: a pan-roasted cod.  The haddock in the fish & chips was too little fish and too much breading.  But at least the breading was delicious: it was eerily reminiscent of funnel cake.  French fries were thick and well seasoned.  The cod was probably the most creative dish we tried: it came with roasted celery (a little intense), over a delicious, creamy celery root puree, and with a shaved salad on top of the fish that reminded me of cole slaw (not a fan).  The cod itself was a very generous piece, well cooked, and simply seasoned.  Good overall, and I appreciated the adventurousness of trying to serve cod with \"celery three ways\" (though not labeled as such).

Finally, our waitress was very nice, but a couple of times she disappeared.  Also, not a huge fan of, \"everything's amazing\" recommendations for what to order or our requests for clarification on various dishes, but that's what we got.

Overall, a good showing.  While there were hints of excellence, the total experience was better-than-average.  I'd definitely give it another shot and saw enough that I'd recommend it to others.  Just order wisely."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday evening with a group of friends.  Here are the ups and downs of the experience:

Atmosphere -- Lively, but not too loud.  All in all, pretty good.

Food -- Rather impressive.  I had one of the specials, a ribeye steak.  My wife had salmon.  Both were quite good and came with tasty veggies.  We also had a salad to start.  I'm not much of a salad fan, but with the hearts of palm and the dressing mixed in, it was really good.  The only halfway negative comment is that the steak looked as if it had been mauled.  It was torn apart, rather than in a single piece, which didn't make for the best plate presentation.  Still tasted mighty good, though.

Value -- Again, fairly impressive.  The ribeye weighed in at $21 and the salmon was only $18.  Given the quality and portion size, you'd pay at least a time and a half for a comparable meal in Washington, D.C. and at some other restaurants in Cleveland.

Service -- Here's the only so-so aspect.  Our server was incredibly kind, so gold star there.  But it took a loooong time for my entree to come out.  The other members of our party all got their dishes around 10 minutes before mine escaped from the kitchen.  Someone from the wait staff (other than our server) came over an apologized, explaining there'd been a snafu in the kitchen.  When I waited tables, generally such a mess-up would always result in a comped appetizer, drink, or even meal.  Apparently, things have changed.  Not that I was looking for anything for free, but it surprised me that they didn't try to apologize with anything beyond words."}
{"text":"Fantastic in every category.  The ambiance is cozy and interesting.  Lots of great little details in their decor.

Here's what my friend and I dined on:

1) Cheese Plate ($12) - Get it.  You get your pick of three cheeses, plus a smorgasbord of delectables including fresh fruits (we got dates, kiwi, melons), nuts (lightly roasted spanish almonds, i think), and some gourmet crackers.  One of our cheeses was made with a spicy mustard and it was just fantastic.

2) Amish Chicken & Waffles - They sure know how to raise a chicken in Amish country, and it shows.  This was one happy chicken, and thusly quite delicious.  Lightly fried, served on top of a belgian waffle with real maple syrup and fresh berries.  Absolutely mouth-watering.

3) Dirty Martinis - Made with blue cheese-stuffed olives.  So good.

Can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Why are reading this and not at Deagan's already? This place is awesome! Great food and great atmosphere. Get the mac n cheese and follow it up with the bacon chocolate bar. I know it sounds strange, but live adventurously. You'll thank me.

There's parking in the back in the municipal lot. Meters are free after 6. There's also a back entrance off of the lot."}
{"text":"Deagan's seems to be yet another one of the \"New American gastropubs with small plates\" that's all the rage right now.  In my opinion, it's nothing more, nothing less.  The atmosphere was good, the food decent, but overall nothing spectacular.

The Granola Parfait was overly sweet, with a large helping of raspberry sauce.  The salad I ordered had a really good avocado dressing; there was just a little too much of it.

Strangely, I thought the best-looking things on the whole table were the Kids' Chicken Tenders with Fruit.  It was a pretty large fruit bowl (apples, strawberries, and oranges) and the chicken tenders were cooked well.

Sure, I didn't have any of the drinks, which you'd think would be the highpoint of a gastropub, so my review might be completely off base.  That being said, it was a fairly average dining experience."}
{"text":"Carnival of errors!  We went last month and weren't impressed but went back because we found a $25 gift card we'd purchased as part of a charity auction basket. We wanted to use it because based on our recent experience we were concerned that Deegan's was going to soon go the way of the other restaurants that had occupied the space. My daughter had a tough time.  First, the salad with grilled chicken was served without chicken and sent back. Then her  creamy tomato soup was served luke warm so we sent it back, too. Server was kind enough to give us our round of drinks on the house. My youngest daughter loved her kids menu chicken tenders. My son's kid's menu was overcooked (ordered medium) as was my wife's burger. My burger was properly cooked but ordinary. I rarely order burgers anymore and mine was disappointing. My daughter's salad with grilled chicken arrived and had foreign matter in it- some kind of labor with letters on it. When I over it up to show the server I saw a bit of hair as well but that may have been from the table. Server comped it, too. 

We paid the bill with our $25 gift card and a credit card. They rang the $25 charge to my credit card then left $2 balance in the gift card. I am in no hurry to get back so they let me apply the leftover $2 balance to the tip. 

With all of the comped food and drink and the gift card it was a cheap dinner."}
{"text":"For my first venture to this place, I hear I should have done brunch, but, alas, I came here for dinner. 

The menu seemed to have enough variety. Based on previous Yelp reviews, I was definitely going to get the cheese board. I got three cheese selections - the cheeses were awesome and the board came with all the \"required\" nibblers plus some. It was really nice selection. Once again my fellow Yelpers were right, the cheese board was a good one. 

For an entree I ordered the crab cakes - they were not bad, but I have a great recipe for crab cakes and mine are better. I shared these with my husband and I shared his order of the beef short ribs. The short ribs were pretty good and I loved that they came on a bed of cauliflower. This entree was much superior to the crab cakes. 
Now the drink, I ordered a sidecar, and it was not impressive. 

So, because parts of the meal weren't super impressive and it was a bit pricey, I'm going with 3 stars. I did really like the interior and the look of the place, very cool. The service was good. 

I have every intention of coming back for brunch sometime and trying to upgrade this review to a 4 star as I hear brunch is much better."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Deagan's has a great menu and an even better beer menu.  Beer cocktail?  Yes please!  I tried their Perogies and they were yummy.  My hubby had the chicken and waffles and of course I stole a few bites and I have to say it was very good!!

The ambiance here says hip and fun.  We were there for a  while so we got to see the crowd come in and go out.  They were busy all night which is always a good sign and there was plenty of people watching to partake in."}
{"text":"Hipsters only. Prepare to be ignored, judged, or just plain rude if you are not one. Service and staff are horrendeous to say the least. I tried this place twice in a year period and my reviews are concrete. Actually, the second visit we walked out after being seated for 15 min with not one single server addressing us. They saw us, they knew we were there, but I guess we are not part of their cool kids hipster club. I don't like supporting this type of 'tude or actions or business. Normal people 0. Hipsters 1. A one star review is gracious. Plus, their food is wayyyy overpriced."}
{"text":"Am I being punked?! I came for Taco Tuesday and ordered the shrimp, shrimp and grits, and the shredded chicken tacos. I asked for corn tortilla and they weren't even cooked. By the time I could enjoy it, it broke apart. As for the shrimp, they were pretty small and few. The tacos were slightly warm and pretty bland. I couldn't finish my last taco. Gotta find dinner elsewhere."}
