{"text":"The food at this place is really bad. They don't have most of their menu items and I think they opened a few months ago. Really? Why does the menu say you have chicken wings when you actually don't or why do have a fountain machine out in the front if it doesn't work??? Anyway, the burger I ordered was cold and still raw from what I could see. The jerk poutine I had was disgusting. It was too salty and the cheese didn't melt into the poutine. Their cooks are no good if they can't make a simple burger and poutine. Also, terrible customer service compared to other restaurants in the area. Cabbagetown restaurants are known for their good food and customer service like the Under The Table Restaurant. The fat lady taking orders at this place doesn't know the meaning of customer service or a clean restaurant. Honestly, with awful food and terrible customer service, you're better off at eating at another place."}
{"text":"Great surprise for Royal York and Lakeshore Blvd West crowd. 
Had the burger and fries. They were awesome; bacon was lean and thick, with real cheddar cheese...drinks are serve yourself and as they ought to be CLEAN, COLD & FIZZY

Next time it's the Philly Steak and Pountine ;)"}
{"text":"I ate here with my sister and daughter. The food was horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. The cheeseburger I received had no cheese, the topping selection was stale and looked old. Also the quality of the beef was not \"premium\" like they claim. The beef patty was over cooked and tasted disgusting. I also tried the poutin, it was the worst I've ever had. This is truly the worst food experience I've ever had. I would strongly recommend to avoid this place."}
