{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! The best part of my meal was the Bonoffee Pie dessert! Literally I could eat this every day. It's got the right amount of sweetness with a good crunch! Every bite was perfect with its gram cracker crust, homemade caramel sauce, homemade whip cream and sliced bananas on top! YUM!"}
{"text":"I went for a business lunch. It took over an hour to get our food. The place was not busy so unsure what caused them to be so unorganized. The waitress was not all that friendly or authentically apologetic for the delay in service. Not sure if it's worth going back with so many other options around.  Food was good, but I won't wait over an hour for a glorified hot pocket."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Large selection of craft beer, love the rotating handles, love the music and the variety of pasties. Staff are always engaging and the food always tastes good. I've had just about every pasty on the menu, but usually hit up three lamb vindaloo - trust an Englishman to drop proper Indian food!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax with some surprisingly different and delicious food!  Service was just right and the pasties were wonderful. A place we will return to again."}
{"text":"I don't often give five stars, but this place deserves it. Delicious pasties which are like meat pies or calzones, filled with anything you like. British style pub, complimented by $4 Irish car bombs, cheap 32 oz IPAs (or stouts, ambers, etc.)  and a beautiful patio/ambiance. Cozy for a date, unassuming for a few bros drinking on a casual night. GO HERE. Sad to move from Scottsdale but get to know the staff they are the best."}
{"text":"I typically don't pass along reviews of places that have overwhelming positive ratings already, but Cornish Pasty Co on Mill Avenue is the exception.  I'm a fan already of CP, but this location takes it another level - honoring the local lore of Long Wongs (pretty cool restaurant and music venue - which was torn down as part of a corporate retail gentrification phase of Mill - that failed, leaving a vacant hole in the Mill landscape where Long Wongs once was).  Currently, you can order Long Wong inspired wings at the Mill pasty location and taste a bit of Tempe history - hope someday they'll consider creating a pasty along the same lines (?!?!)  Thanks for caring about the Tempe experience, and making Mill a better place - little things add up."}
{"text":"Today I was hoping to get a hearty comfort meal. Instead, I had to walk back to my office empty-handed and empty-bellied.

I had walked past the restaurant on Mill about a week ago. Since I'd tried the food in Scottsdale before, I thought it would make a great meal for lunch -- especially since extenuating circumstances prevented me from getting breakfast or making a packed lunch this morning. So, I looked up their menu on the website, looked up the only location in Tempe, and called in the order. They said it'd be ready in 15 minutes.

So I put on my hat, walk the long distance from my office, and step inside. I catch the eye of the worker and pull my credit card out of my wallet, expecting this to be easy. But that couldn't have been farther from the reality.

The order wasn't there. The worker said they never got any phone call. They asked which number I called, and I read it off to them from the \"Recent Calls\" on my cell phone. I was then informed that the order must've gone to their \"other\" Tempe location. There is only one Tempe location online. So I asked how long it would take to make me the one that I had been waiting on, and was informed that it would take up the only time remaining on my lunch break. I had enough time to eat (I'm usually capable of finishing a meal in about 10 minutes) but no hope of having enough time to wait for the preparation.

To make matters worse, they informed me there that they don't have everything that their online menu says they do. There is no indicator anywhere on their website or their online menu that a separate menu exists for any of their locations.

So I walked back to my office in the heat, tearing up and trying very hard not to publicly cry, trying to figure out how to get through the rest of my workday on a completely empty stomach. I was not prepared to fast, and my job demands a sharp mind.

Luckily, I was rescued from Cornish Pasty's ineptitude by a box of Lunchables from the Sun Devil Marketplace.

If an establishment screws me over when it hurts me the most, they don't deserve my time or money at those times when I have more time and money. I take back anything good I ever said about the chain, and will be telling my friends and family about my experience. It doesn't matter how tasty the food is if you're never able to eat it."}
{"text":"Things you should know:
-They have a parking lot, but it's shared with another restaurant and it's TINY. It's actually right in the middle of a busy downtown area, so street parking was also pretty packed. Even though the restaurant was maybe half to two-thirds full, we had to park another street over and walk.
-You just walk in and seat yourself.
-You can't order pasties with particular ingredients removed (i.e. ask for a Reuben without the sauerkraut). All the pasties are pre-made. So if you don't like sauerkraut, you can't order a Reuben; if you're allergic to onions, you can't order a Pilgrim, etc.

I met family here; they were visiting from out of town and the reviews for this place looked good and it said the place was okay for kids. The waiter was very polite and patient when my niece was grabbing ice out of our glasses, and brought some extra napkins. The food was also amazing, and very filling. One pasty is enough for about two meals for me. I was very sad when I had driven away and suddenly realized I left the to-go boxes on the table :( At least I still have the most delicious burps ever."}
{"text":"Seriously just went back the other week and this is still my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. You go Glenn Coco."}
{"text":"Ok, for the palette, everyone is different, but the sage sausage and cheese pasty was spectacular with the side mustard and HP sauce, just spectacular! You need the tang of the HP sauce to kick up a notch! Yummy!

Of course, add a couple Bodingtons and we are having fun!!!!!"}
{"text":"Totally surprised how good this place was. I got the eggplant pasty.. if you don't know what a pasty is, I'll give you a quick description- a flaky pie crust loaded with cheese, meat and/or veggies, kinda like calzone style. Lots of vegetarian options, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Loved the pesto chicken pasty!! Yummy!  Comfortable, enjoyable place! Service is a little lacking...at least the server we had. Others could be better...don't know!"}
{"text":"The building is fabulous and the bar is great too.  That is where it ends. The food is a clever step up from bar food.  It is a lot of pastry and  mixture of interesting ingredients.  If you never cooked then this might be intriguing also if you are 22  years old.   The music is blaring to the point of  waitress screaming at us and still  didn't know what she said.    I cook infinitely better at home with one hand tied behind my back.   Too bad for us it could have been a cool place to hang more than once.
We won't go back."}
{"text":"Always a solid meal. Great food, beer and atmosphere.  The spicy asiago chicken is excellent!"}
{"text":"Great expectations followed by a disappointing experience.  Seat yourself . . . and wait.  Order your food . . . and wait.  Food lukewarm.  One item was completely different from what was ordered.  Send back to kitchen for correct menu item . . . and wait . . .  while the rest of the table eats theirs. Manager walked right by us and said nothing. We spent more time starving and waiting for our food than we did enjoying anything fantastic.  No apologies at all while we sat for over an hour at an empty table.  Absolutely nothing would make us want to go back when there are so many other choices."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great patio space & 4 kinds of cooling at the bar is super-refreshing on a hot day. Nice selection of mixed drinks & craft beers. Bartenders are toats-friendly & great for recommendations to other local bars/restaurants.

Of course, the pasties are great too. Lamb & mint and the Tikka masala were stand-outs. Right off Main St in Old Town & definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"This location is as good as the Dobson location. The pasties are some of the best I have ever had. Try the \"Pilgrim\" and you we be enjoying the taste of thanksgiving in a pastie!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Come at LEAST once a week. The best location, as well. The only thing I wish they had was the Chai Cider they offer at the Mesa location. Pair that with the Guinness and it's the best holiday snakebite around!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum basically and english calzone, and theres multiple different stuffing options! I've had the OG pasty and I've had the one with potatoes. Delect!"}
{"text":"After several visits to this restaurant, the Scottsdale location, I have to say that I really love this place.  The service can  be a bit slow at times, but the made from scratch offerings makes up for it.

The first time I came here I had a lamb pasty with red wine sauce, a real winner. The second time I got the Reuben pasty--delish.  The third time I had the traditional pasty made with beef and rutabaga, divine.  They are baked to order; be ready for a wait, but the freshness of the pasties will make any wait time a triviality.  This is not fast food and it shows. 

The pasties come with a multitude of fillings, so everyone can find something to satisfy their taste buds. While most of the pasties are filled with meat, vegetarians and vegans are not forgotten here.  The restaurant makes two vegan pasties daily, and the menu has numerous vegetarian options.

The soups are fabulous and homemade.  At $7.00 a bowl, the potato, leek, Stilton soup is practically a meal in itself.  It comes with homemade bread and will fill you up, making it a cheap, delicious lunch or light dinner.  I've also had the tomato soup, another winner, and there are more I haven't tried.

The desserts are sublime.  Last time I had the banoffee pie, an English dessert pie made with toffee, bananas and whipped cream, homemade and luscious.  On another visit I had the chocolate bread and butter pudding--fantastic.  

The menu is extensive and includes salads, appetizers and sides, not to mention a full bar and a wine and beer list.  The ambiance is laid  back and decidedly English, with its dim lights and dark, wooden furniture.  However, it's kid friendly and your family will enjoy this place.  I came here with my granddaughter once and she ate all my potato-leek soup!  Go  on down to the Old Town area and have a new taste experience at this restaurant, where everything is made from scratch and it shows in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Very good food, great ambiance and service.

We are here recently for lunch and I didn't know what to expect. It was a toss up between a rosemary chicken pasty (pronounced pas-tee) and a chicken pot pie pasty.

I went with the chicken pot pie and it was delicious. Big chunks of chicken, delicious vegetables and large chunks of potato. 

The service was excellent (three different people stopped by to help) and the wait was minimal for lunchtime. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. If you are wondering what the food is like it is a pot pie of sorts with many different fillings to choose. There is no better comfort food than this on a friday night :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a team outing. Extremely friendly waiters. They were very attentive. The food was excellent. Didn't know what a Pasty was until I tried my first one. It is similar to a calzone. I highly recommend this restaurant due to the variety of choices on the pasty and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is so great! I love eating here! They have the best food! Come hungry because you will leave stuffed! I like all of the pasties so it is so hard to pick! I had a turkey dinner one that was so good! My boyfriend had a Mexican pasty that was pretty good too! I just usually let the staff pick since I am sure they try them all! Love coming here late night for drinks!!"}
{"text":"Eating at Cornish Pasty Co. with two of my friends was very satiating. However, I was not completely captivated. I will list the reasons why I gave this place 4 (and not 5) stars.

Pros:
The environment is relaxing, clean, and comely. I really enjoyed the convenience of a parking area, despite its near-the-neighborhood location. The environment of the restaurant itself has a grandma's-house feel, so it makes you extremely comfortable. The bathrooms (male) are absolutely spotless, and there was no trash or grease using around the floor. The food was simply delicious. I ordered the Oggie (it was my first time there) while my other friends ordered Bangers & Mash and Carne Adovada. The Oggie's pork, cheese, and potatoes were balanced well, and the red wine gravy goes well with the pasty itself. The pasty crust was very crispy, but the crispness went slightly over the top. The homemade lemonade that we ordered actually tasted homemade--not doused with too much sugar. It was almost worth the money for a decent amount of food.

Cons:
Even though the environment was nice, the food took way too long to prepare. We were actually starting to wonder if something happened inside the kitchen when the food finally arrived. When we first walked in the restaurant, no waiter came to us to tell us what to do. They expect you to take your seat and order for yourself. Secondly, parts of our crust were burnt. I presumed that burnt crust was supposed to happen when I read about the history of the restaurant, since it states that women made a thick crimped part where the miners held their pasties, which I assumed will be similar to the burned part of my pasty. But upon seeing that one of my friends had neither of his pasties burnt, I wasn't too happy. There was a great balance between the fillings and the crust, but the meat was somehow overcooked.

Overall, I was personally pleased with my visit, and I will try to come here again if the location was not so far away from my house. No more KFC chicken pot pie for me, the crust is just not as good as this."}
{"text":"A great place to hangout. Enjoy good beers. Eat vegan/vegetarian pasties. Don't miss to visit this place if you are in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. While the pasties are not made to order, they are definitely worth trying. I really enjoyed trying pasties when I was in England. I was happy to find a place in phoenix. This location feels much better/different (casual/less divey) than the tempe location (more dark/divey).

I will definitely visit their Vegas outpost when I am there. They should expand to SF bay area."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was told this was amazing and it is true!  I felt like I was in England!  Seriously though the staff were friendly and helpful!  The beer selection great and the Pastys were AMAZING!  We tried the Shepard's  pie and Guinness....lets just say you can't go wrong.  All the Pastys are amazing!  Check it out!  It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is so so. I had to wait and get waitress attention to get my drink refilled. No one came to check if things ok.
I ordered the Pilgrim for my daughter but she doesn't like onions. I asked if the onions can be taken off. The waitress replied with No addition or substitution. Hello, this is called \"substraction\". I didn't ask for extra or change. If you can't accommodate a simple request like this, I will think twice if I will come again. Take care of your customers and improve the service."}
{"text":"Dig this place!  Laid back atmosphere and yummy food.  So rad!  Great place to take visitors. They have a good selection of vegetarian options, tons of brews and to die for pie! Support local!"}
{"text":"I wish that this place was local so that I could go every week. I first had pasties in Copper Harbor in the UP of Michigan and fell in love with them. I have not found them in very many places if at all, so when I saw this place I had to go. They really know their stuff. The pasties were delicious, the atmosphere was fantastic, and the price was not outrageous either. We partnered them with some of the great beer selection that was available and the evening was wonderful. I highly recommend the Cornish Pasty Company."}
{"text":"i'm sure these pasties are the best ever, but food has improved since Victorian times. we liked them well enough, but i think too many reviewers here are being nostalgic or something. the bar itself was really cool, and a nice place to hunker down with friends, if you are into that kinda thing."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday night. The food was great. The pasties were hot and golden brown. They have many different varieties on the menu so it is hard to choose. They also have many beers on the menu to choose from.  I liked the atmosphere. It reminded me of eating in a pub in London. We will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"I tried to eat here tonight for my birthday and it didn't happen. I went there with my family and didn't have a reservation, because i had been told in the past not to make one with a party under 10. We were told it would be 15 to 20 minutes for a table and decided to wait. I asked if they had vegan options still available and told there were three. 20 minutes went by and we had to ask how long and then were told it would be another 15 to 20 minutes. We wanted to sit inside, but the were no tables and went outside. By then it had been almost 40 minutes. We weren't too order and were told they had only 2 vegan options now. My friend and i ordered one and my family ordered. Turns out what i ordered was not available any longer. They only has a spicy option. I said i couldn't eat that and we were going to leave. The waitress talked to the kitchen and they said they would throw something together. Fine. The waitress then comes back again fine minutes later and says they were out of almost everything my family ordered as well. By this point, we had been there over an hour and had only had water and everything we wanted to eat was sold out. We ended up leaving and didn't get dinner together. My family had driven from Glendale and we didn't even get to eat together for my birthday. We got a free iced tea though. I love their food, but don't think i will ever go back there after this."}
{"text":"Can't really tell you about the food or drinks.  Arrived at the restaurant. Was seated at a table. waiter looked at us a couple of times but no one ever came over to the table to ask if we wanted to order.  Maybe they just thought we needed to sit down for awhile. Three other table were seated and served while we waited.  About 15 minutes went by and we left.  We were very disappointed because we really wanted to try their pasties but we won't be back.  I don't think they really care!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were recommended this place by some friends so we finally stopped by. We live close to old town so we had high hopes that this would be a new go to spot for us. 

The pasties we had were great. My husband had a light beer which he loved and was on happy hour. The atmosphere was unique and inviting. Unfortunately, our server Alejandra made us feel less than important. We waited ridiculously long for everything, and I finally had to approach her for our check. She was on her phone leaning on the bar and rudely snapped at me. Scottsdale is rich with service oriented restaurants and this place will need to step it up to survive. It will be a while before I consider returning."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than finding a place that is not your run of the mill restaurant. I'm always combing Yelp for the original restaurant that will catch my attention when I visit somewhere new. I found the perfect restaurant in the Cornish Pasty Company! We walked over after looking at some art in Old Scottsdale. The patio setting was perfect for hanging out on and having a cold beer. Their beer selection was impressive and the waitstaff super friendly and cool. The food is absolutely amazing! I tell you I don't know how they do it! The pasty is an art if you've ever had one. The key is the balance of the ingredients and that they are perfectly cooked but most importantly the crust has to be crisp on the outside and soft inside. I will say these were as perfect as they come. The portions were hearty and I would have eaten two if I could have! I highly recommend going with the traditional Oggie or Veggie Oggie it's your first time."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I have a bunch of food restrictions and the manager and bartender went through the entire menu with me. Everyone is incredibly accommodating here. The food is good. The drink selection is awesome. My friend had a beer and the bartender (Eddy/Eddie)  brought him a tall glass of water without being asked. The Pavlova desert is huge!"}
{"text":"Delicious - all of the pasties are great, and I really love the lamb vindaloo one. Ask for a little bit of cucumber and red onion on the side and nibble a little of each with every bite dipped in the yogurt sauce - perfect ^_^ I've been to this one and the one in Tempe; this one is a little better suited to families as the other location is great for date nights. The food and beer at both are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Sensational food. Never had nothing like these crispy, delightful pasties before but they are wonderful."}
{"text":"Good eats and lots and lots of libation choices.

If you're new to the pasty world, try the Oggie- it's the most traditional. My husband loves the red wine gravy sauce that it comes with.

Also, it would be really good if the owner could ask his waitstaff to not play with their facial piercings at any time when they are working. That was a little disturbing."}
{"text":"I called my order in over the phone and was please with the customer service, and was told it would take about 15 min for my two pastys. 
    I pulled up to the restaurant and on the outside it looked like a cozy little house with patio seating on two sides of the building. Not very many parking spaces available, so parallel parking on the street may be required. 
    I walked in with the impression it was going to be a small seating area but to my surprise it was quite large and open with many tables. I walked in a little further to the open kitchen behind the bar and the aroma was just amazing! I liked the fact you could sit at the bar and watch your pasty being made if you wanted to. 
    I paid about $9 for each pasty and for the price it was a suitable size! I ordered the Italian pasty and it was delicious and stuffed with the items it came with! I ate half and was full. My son...the pickiest 4 year old ate the other half and loved it!!! 
    I will definitely be returning and I am an extremely satisfied first time customer!"}
{"text":"BRING BACK EDDIE. This place isn't the same without our favorite bartender. We used to come here every weekend for happy hour, but happy hours aren't the same anymore. I guess we'll have to find a new spot."}
{"text":"Great place to go after wine tasting across the street at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards Wine Gallery."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing!! I was here 2 days ago and still dream about my pasty! To be honest, I never had a pasty before so I was hesitant. My friends suggested we try it and the reviews I read were encouraging. I was pleasantly surprised to see how many vegetarian options they had. The food was delicious and I left feeling satisfied without feeling overly full. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often! Make sure to try their version of the moscow mule!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. This place is practically a chain in the valley now, but they haven't lost any of the taste of the original. Also the hip factor is still there in a casual place to enjoy some great food in Scottsdale. I don't think I've ever had a bad \"pasty\" and their soup is good too with a great list of beers on draft. Nice indoor and outdoor seating. Meat and veggie options available. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great!  Great atmosphere/setup, great location, great drinks, great staff, better than great food.   I've tried at least 8 different pasties and they're all incredible.  The salads are good, the soups are even better and are served with a near half-loaf of sliced bread for dipping. Everything is savory and delicious, it reminds me of eating Grandma's cooking... in a badass pub."}
{"text":"ZOMG. Everyone else, please step your food game up. This place rocks. The food rocks. The lemonade rocks. The soup rocks. The staff rocks."}
{"text":"We just had an amazing experience at the Cornish Pasty Co in Scottsdale. We had our after-wedding brunch here yesterday, as my now husband is British and thought it would be a nice touch to introduce the Americans to Cornish Pasties as a farewell treat.

We initially thought we'd only have 20-30 people at brunch as people were flying out that day, but ended up with a healthy crowd of around 60 people! Justin and his team were able to scramble with limited resources and accommodate everyone flawlessly. Not only was the customer service friendly and attentive, but the food was hot, fresh and made to order. Nothing suffered as a result of my off-estimates. 

Everyone had a great time- the space is modern and open. We loved the family-style tables and open-air floor plan. The pasties and mimosas were tasty (I had the english breakfast pasty- It brought me right back to England!). 

All around a perfect morning and exactly what we were looking for in a after-wedding brunch. Casual but classy, great food, friendly service and very affordable (the hotels nearby wanted to charge us a 1500 set up fee and 30 bucks minimum a head for pastries and fruit only).

Thank you Justin, Ryan and team for a seamless event! I would recommend any stressed-out bride to consider this spot for your brunch event as well."}
{"text":"Great place to get some freshly cooked comfort food. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. This place is a keeper. I loved the Chicken pot pie. The bangers and mash was great too. Next time I'm going to have the Royal with cheese!"}
{"text":"We were first timers there and felt welcomed. The service was good. The food was delicious. The desert (sticky toffee pudding) was to die for. So yummy. #fromSoCal"}
{"text":"This restaurant chain is awesome! Unfortunately Alejandra served us. The worst service I've experienced. Other than that amazing."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland!!!! My family and I were there for Sunday lunch.  We all ordered  pasties and all of us were terribly disappointed.  The food was soooooooo bland and unseasoned. No flavor at all.  Service was bad too, the server didn't came to our table not even once. Worst place to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love love love LOVE this place. It's my go-to spot for food. Cheap, tasty, great atmosphere, nice outdoor patio and great location. The greek salad and chicken tikka salad are my favorites and the reuben pasty is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I just went there tonight with a friend, I have driven past there more times than I can remember& never went in, I am so sad I have been missing out for this long!! The ambiance was awesome, service was very attentive and the good was absolute savory perfection! 
      We started out with a couple Moscow mules (made with ginger beer- not ginger ale) and the parliament wings- both hit the perfect spot and were amazing! 
      My friend was nursing a hangover and so she ordered the \"royale with cheese\" which is basically a cheeseburger & french fries wrapped in pastry dough- she loved it (I'm not much of a ground beef fan). I got the \"pilgrim\" which is thanksgiving dinner in a single dish! The first bite blew my mind, it was so flavorful and savory I was in love immediately! I tried the accompanying gravy, but it was salty and took away from the perfect combination of flavors. I tried the cranberry sauce for the next bite, it was good- but the pasty is really just perfect on its own- so I only used the cranberry sauce for the \"crust\" of the pasty. 
The good was amazing, definitely not \"healthy\" but I feel ok with every delicious calorie I consumed and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wish they had other British isle favorites, meat pies, bridies, sausage rolls, steak and kidney pie. Food I got was excellent. The bangers and mash. And the italian. Sides of dipping gravy were fresh. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a fantastic meal, meet friends, and have a few drinks. Service has always been outstanding and prices are comparable with other restaurants in the area. Plenty of spots to sit inside and the outdoor patio is quite big and can accommodate large groups of people."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience here and I have to say it was fantastic. The Scottsdale location has a great patio, our server was awesome and the food was phenomenal. We ordered the bread and butter, the parliment wings and the Carne Adovada. I loved all that was ordered.  I was surprised and excited that you can order uncooked ones and take them with you as well. This was a cool place and the food is excellent.  I will definitely be a regular patron both eating in and taking home. If you are put off by the name like I was, forget that just come in because you will LOVE it."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place, but it's probably good for my waistline that I don't. I've been three times now and tried three different pasties. All delicious. The pastry crust is consistent. Service always friendly. I love the British pub atmosphere. Next time I'll try another variety. Oh, and the desserts are yummy too and guaranteed to induce food coma."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Very unique and special restaurant.
All their good is great.  I love pasties 
This place is all fresh ingredients and has a cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"If you like comfy, rich and filling foods, then this is the place to be. Their bread is soft and soups are limited, but tasty. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This new location is a nice upgrade (building wise) to the other locations.  The food and drinks were great, as usual.  However, after being seated, it took over five minutes before anyone even stopped by the table.  With that said, the service was great afterwards."}
{"text":"I didn't think I was going to like this but I did. 

The pasty looked small but it filled me up. The waitress was very understanding and took care of us."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal .  I've had almost all of their pasties over time.  Lots of seating.  Some of it is unique, group, open tables. 

Use it to meet new people. You never know who you might run into in Old Town"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after hiking at Hayden Butte. Or friends had been to another location so suggested we go here after waking by. With for adults, one kid and a baby we almost didn't stay due to the small space, but a big booth was open so we sat there.

Large menu, had no idea what I wanted. I ended up with the chicken pot pie pasty and ate the whole thing. The meatball pasty looked great too. I'd definitely try another location if I'm ever near one."}
{"text":"The scottsdale location is the most relaxed during the day.  It was super nice to sit outside and not have it be too busy or crowded.  I've been eating at this restaurant for years and it never gets old!

Great beers on tap and amazing food.  Get the veggie mexican!"}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as we walked up. Perfect day to sit outside. There was nice soft music that thankfully wasn't to loud. Cars driving by  were noisy enough. Our waiter took our drink order immediately.  The salad was a little gritty but the dressing was amazing! We ordered two steak pasty and one veggie. All were delicious. great place!"}
{"text":"Pasties are delicious! The restaurant is very open and comfortable, I recommend sitting on the patio. Great beer selection, Service was great. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"What a cool place!  When you walk in they tell you that you can sit anywhere, we opted to sit inside since it is hot out, but the patio looks like it would be great when it is cooler out (they also have misters so it isn't too bad out there).  I ordered their version of a Moscow Mule, very good!  I asked the server which of the pasties are most popular and one she mentioned was the Pilgrim, which is turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce.  It was so delicious and very filling.  Service was very attentive, food was great, I will definitely be back!  I can't wait for the downtown Phoenix location!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place everyday for the last year, I finally had to stop and figure out why it's always so crowded. I ordered the cheese steak patsy and LOVED it. I craved it so much had to go back two days later and order it again. I sat at the inside bar, and watched them making different patsy's. There is a lot of work and detail that goes into these things. I need to try some of their other creations, but so far....excellent. The service was very average, and a bit on the slow side. Correct that and it's a true gem."}
{"text":"It's too bad that I couldn't give Cornish Pasty Co. four or five stars like the rest of the reviewers.  Like always, the food is ridiculous...  The Oggie is always a classic and the Pilgrim was excellent, but the service sucked, just like the other locations.

For a Thursday night, it wasn't too busy.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the great weather.  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and gave us quite a few suggestions on which Pasty's to branch out on.  After we ordered, the service went downhill as it took about 35 minutes for us to get our food.  I can understand that these pasty's are handmade, baked in the oven, but it shouldn't take that long to get your food.  Maybe if there were 40 tickets ahead of yours on a busy Friday or Saturday night, sure... but it was damn near empty.  I would like to see how Cornish Pasty Co. handles themselves on a busy Friday or Saturday night.

I was severely disappointed by the crappy service and will likely leave a bad taste in my mouth for a dine-in experience.  Maybe this was a fluke, but I have had very similar experiences at each location and its disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't normally write views but when I do I feel compelled to let the world know how great/bad something is especially when I see other reviews that may conflict with my own. I happened to have the spinach/mushroom soup served by April and I tell you what, this is AMAZING! The soup is my new favorite just the right amount of flavor and heat making it a staple for me. My husband and I had the most coolest server, April with the most decorative tattoos and charisma, wow she was so attentive and made my husband and I feel welcomed. We are locals and have found that service like this is to be cherished. Soup or no soup we are coming back for the service especially if it's April.
P.S. I didn't see it on the menu but they have $3.00 Irish Car Bombs that I would never of known about if it weren't for April."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had never had pasties before trying this place, it seems to be the American version of empanadas. The Pilgrim is Thanksgiving in your mouth! The Chicken Pot Pie, Lamb Vindaloo and the Eggplant Parmesan are must tries. They have such a wide selection that you will have a hard time picking just one. One con is that they do not have great sides to accompany their pasties."}
{"text":"Awesome concept, awesome meal. The review may raise to 5 stars if I were to try different pasty options, but this review was for the ones we tried. We had the shepards pie and greek pasties, both were good, but others looked like they were much better. The smashed peas and fries were also awesome. 

I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was amazing! I had only been to the Tempe location, but this one is my new location! I had my favorite, the \"oggie\", wings that were phenomenal and a couple of beers. I'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale has scored big on this new place. 
A fabulous spot. BEST food, ambiance, and service. If I could, I would hook the entire place up and drag it to San Diego, just as it is, and with all the employees. 
Sit at the outside bar or head inside for raucous fun. I have tried a different pasty each time I've visited the one in Tempe, and this brand new place knocks it out of the park. 
Eat half your pasty, pack up the rest and save room for the sticky toffee pudding! It's rich and tasty, and served with ice cream, which makes it a perfect dessert.
Yummmmmmy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here! This location is really nice and a good place to probably have a small get together. Kind of hidden, but great place!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and everything was delicious and hot. We had the Chicken pot pie pasty and a treacle tart for pudding. Will come back to eat in for sure."}
{"text":"Wow. Just picked this place for dinner while traveling for work. I absolutely loved it. I had the shepherd's pie pasty. Oh so good. The minced lamb was perfect in it. I wish we had a place like this in So Cal. If you're in the Scottsdale area, eat here!! A very casual atmosphere. Great for unwinding with good comfort food and a beer (nice beer selection)."}
{"text":"In from LA and my friends brought me here tonight it was very good, the beer/wine/booze selection was very good, with lots of options.  The food was so simply good!  I had the Greek Chicken which was very tasty, I was concerned about the tzatziki as it looked like honey mustard, but was very good and I sampled my friends's Guinness pasty which was rib sticking! The waitress Andrea was exceptional as she was very attentive to us, provided us with good suggestions and was gorgeous!!  It is interesting to maintain the history of this dish, I am looking forward to having it in LA/California."}
{"text":"Best chicken potpie in the country period. I have traveled to England and tried it but nothing like here. Love chicken potpie? This is the place. They don't make it until you order it."}
{"text":"Every time I am in town this is a must go.
Cold local beer on tap.
They have you covered with a large selection. Try the lamb."}
{"text":"Very unique place. I'm from NE Lower Michigan and Pastie's are our favorite?...they, CPC, did a great job!! Great beverage offerings? too."}
{"text":"Come for great food and excellent drinks. If you really want the Pilgrim pasty go during the week to guarantee that it's not sold out. Arrive before 8pm for more of a dinner feel. Oddly, my favorite Greek salad  is served here. I think I would eat everything put in front of me if it had their dressing. Service always pleasant. Perfect for and outdoor dining experience when weather permits. Take tourists here for a fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went for the first time last night with some friends and we were all impressed! Food is fantastic, people are cool, great service, great ambiance and an awesome beer list. Simple food done well. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I have visited both the Tempe and old town locations and I really enjoy both for their unique vibes, but the old town location is a little more open and has a great patio to enjoy. I have tried several of the pasties but my favorites are the more traditional ones, especially the chicken pot pie pasty - just a perfect, flaky crust and rich, saucy fillings that warm you to the core. 

Speaking of warming you to the core, get yourself a cup of the leek soup - it's so underrated and you won't even believe it. Spread some butter on the house made bread, dip it in the soup and you've got yourself a little piece of heaven. 

Always great British beers and ales on tap too - one of my favorite restaurants to bring visitors to in the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of filings... great vegetarian / gluten free options. Try the Mushroom, Spinach and Walnut soup - insanely good."}
{"text":"Really very good food. We had the all day breakfast pasty and the shepherd pie. Delicious. They have a great variety of beers and the place has a fun vibe. Lots of outdoor and indoor seating as well. Pasties are all priced around ten bucks and are very filling."}
{"text":"I love me a good pasty and they are delish here!  So many to chose from!"}
{"text":"Wow, what horrible service. I love this place but my server not only ruined my night but my entire tables. If you love great food, atmosphere and drinks come here. But be aware if you get April she will take forever and you will get cold food and flat beer."}
{"text":"My visit here came from a reccomendation from a friend in jerzy and i have to admit he was on point.  This tiny spot in the heart of ASU was huge in character and flavor.  I had the Oggie Pasty which consisted of steak, potatos, onions, and rutabaga served with some sort of heavenly wine sauce.  It was a party in my freakin' mouth!  Haha...I also sampled a local craft beer (Odell...drumroll APA) which was also really good."}
{"text":"How is it that everyone in Phoenix has heard about this place for years and I just discovered it a week ago. I drive for Lyft in my spare time and I was dropping off a lot of passengers at the downtown Phoenix location so I figured there had to be something special about this place. Finally decided to check out the Scottdale location. Wow! I will definitely be a regular! The broccoli cauliflower bake was amazing and so were the curry potatoes. I've tried two pasties and both were fantastic. The daytime bartender Colleen is great too. She knew which beer I liked on only my second visit."}
{"text":"Relaxing, intimate, and cozy spot on mill. We love stopping by for a drink or two, and Riley is always super sweet."}
{"text":"Cozy, relaxing environment & vibes. Best vegetarian options. The pasta salad is my jam. Rogue hazelnut on draft is on point. This is a place to slow your roll & enjoy life."}
{"text":"My first time here was last night. We sat at the bar and the service was amazing. Great bartender, awesome happy hour and the food was amazing! I had the Eggplant Parm and my fiance had the Royale with chesse! We will definitely be repeat customers here!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing but the service at this location is ALWAYS bad. My wife and I came in for our third and probably last visit last night. The place wasn't even half full yet it took over an hour for our 1 pasty that we were sharing to arrive. Also, we were sitting at the bar and had to flag the bartender over after waiting 10 minutes just to order a drink. She seemed more interested in talking with what appeared to be her friends at the other end and not really attending to anyone else."}
{"text":"For us 'ol school tempeans and die hard long wongs on mill fans. This cornish has the original long wongs wing recipe and serves it to perfection. Dare I say Cornish long wong wings are better than the originals? Yep, I might think so."}
{"text":"Came by during lunch. Had the Cornish Meatballs, Shepard's Pie, Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese, and the Oven Chips with Garlic.  The overall ambiance of the restaurant is great.  Love the theme.  Didn't try anything from the bar because I don't drink.  The meatballs were fantastic, great big bangs of flavor in each bite.  I wasn't fond of the Shepard's Pie, but I think that wasn't a great choice on my part.  Should've went with something else.  Garlic Mashed Potatoes were good, as were the Oven Chips.  Wish there was one of these in LA, as I would definitely be back to try more items.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale or Phoenix, will definitely be back to try it again."}
{"text":"My second Pasty experience (first at this location) doubled as my first International Supper Club experience...both aimed to please!

The restaurant had no trouble dealing with our large group.. our table was ready when we got there, the server was patient and attentive, and the checks were split to our preference.  

Our sub-party of three decided to order two Pasties and split them.  We got The Royal with Cheese (kind of a souped-up burger, Pasty-style) and The Mexican.  I was slightly deceived about the level of heat in The Mexican, so my fellow spice wimps out there may want to beware.  I wish I could take the jalepeños though, because the flavor was great.  The Royal was awesome, especially with the dipping sauces.  

Everyone's meals looked fantastic and I wish we'd had the time and appetite to try some of the dessert.  I can't wait to come back and keep moving through the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped here Friday.  Great pasties.  My wife grew up in Lansing, Michigan and when they drove up to UP, would get pasties so after eating here my last trip I had to take her this trip.  Great food and an incredible menu.  Also great craft beer menu.  

My wife had the salmon and I had the Carne Asada, no sour cream, lots of salsa.   We will visit every time we come to AZ."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Great bar area and patio. Good service and the food - primarily Cornish Pastys - are good and something different from the norm.  The Pilgrim is like Thanksgiving dinner in a turnover.  Excellent.  Diverse beer selection, both on tap and bottles.  Good place to hang out near Old a Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pasty pockets of deliciousness. I've had nearly everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed. Of course there are those I prefer over others but nothing has been bad. I've introduced many of my friends to this place and all have thoroughly enjoyed it. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. The decor is warming, the setting is great and is pretty spacious. 

The service was awesome (that's the 4th star right there). Ilana is great!

I had the leak soup which was tasteful and filling. 

The peppered pastie was good as well as the rosemary garlic side red potatoes.

Prices are also not that bad.

Great place to become a regular.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"We started with the chicken liver pate. It was fabulous. Our party had the rosemary chicken pastie and the eggplant Parmesan pastie. Both were delicious. We ended with the English toffee pudding. To die for!

Atmosphere was great. Tons of outdoor seating. We sat inside but it wasn't cold which is nice in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I like nothing more than a good pasty. 

I enjoyed the one I ate tonight. However, I would have preferred the beer didn't come with a glass that looked snotted-in. A dirty, warm glass doesn't exactly scream \"attention to detail,\" sadly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cool and the food was pretty good, although the service was terrible. Messed up our order and the wait time to get our drinks, food, bill, etc was ridiculous."}
{"text":"1st I love the Tempe location. But, this location is a few miles closer so we tried it. Unfortunately 1 waitress appeared to be serving the entire place while the other people working there spent 30 minutes discussing a missing receipt in front of us as we waited for menus. The food was slow to get delivered and at this location it was also bland which is a shame because I know how delicious the Carne adovada is supposed to taste. Even our forgotten dessert was off when we finally got it. I recommend sticking to the original Tempe location."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with the family and we all enjoyed the experience.  It was a beautiful day for the patio.  We all tried different flavor Pasties and enjoyed them.  The tandoori chicken was rich in spices with just a bit of heat...awesome.  My father really enjoyed the Guinness pasty."}
{"text":"We arrived and sat down at the table. Server took our drink order which arrived 20mins later (Hot water and tea bags). In the mean time we watched 4 groups of people come in and get seated. They all ordered after us but received their food at least 20mins before us. Then when our food did arrive, it was hot around the edges but lukewarm in the middle. Drove 45 mins for the bad service and lukewarm food. Shame, it seems like a nice place but service and quality control was lacking, maybe just an off day. Good luck with yours."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable, my drinks were refilled before they were empty! Food was fantastic! Too many options to list that I have tried over the past few years, so far all have been great! Soaps are super too!"}
{"text":"Great casual place. We were a party if 6 adults and a toddler. We had a fun spot outside which worked well with a child. The beer and pasties were excellent. As was the chocolate dessert. Another fun spot in Old Town."}
{"text":"I'm sure the average person would love Cornish Pasty Co., however I didn't have such a great experience. To preface, I have an unfortunate circumstance where I'm allergic to onions, so sadly that limits what I can order when eating at a restaurant. 

So because of this, I noticed immediately that many of the items on the menu included onions. I asked the waitress if there was any chance they could be removed or excluded altogether, and she informed me this was impossible because all their pasties are pre-ordered from another location and reheated on site to serve. 

This surprised me, and also had me questioning how much more the cooks do besides heating pre-made food and sticking it on a plate since the majority of their menu are the pre-made pasties.  My 8-year-old cousin could do that, but the cooks here get paid for it. 

While I don't agree with their business practices and believe it lowers the quality of the food, it wasn't more than somewhat of an annoyance. The real problem came when I ordered a pasty, and after questioning the waitress and her insisting it didn't contain onions, it actually did. And I paid the price for it and suffered a reaction because the waitress gave me incorrect information. 

As I said, I'm sure the average person would enjoy this place. But my experience was sadly very dreadful, and I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great good, great vibe. Had the Shepard's Pie Pasty and British hubby had Bangers and mash! Crust was buttery and flaky. Banoffee Pie was out of this world! Atmosphere had hints of a traditional pub contrasted with a contemporary hipster vibe. Great cocktails and draft beer. Calorific heaven."}
{"text":"I love this place!
It is comfort food at its finest! The prices are very reasonable and the food it great.
I like to pick up a par-baked pasty and take it home to bake ...it only takes about 20min in the oven to finish the baking. You can get any pasty to-go this way, just give them a 5-10 min heads up and it will be ready to pick up when you arrive.
The pate is also good, be sure to order it with a side of their house made mustard, YUM!"}
{"text":"Really an open air English pub with basic bar and bench style seating. Great curb appeal too. Staff was friendly and helpful. The beer selection is strong with almost no domestic beers. The food is a homemade hot pocket but fantastic. Lots of selection for ingredients and the pastry is thin and light. Very hearty and good for lunch."}
{"text":"Had a total blast here, patio was really well set up and lit for a cool late night date spot. Had the Lamb and Mint Pot Pie, great side sauce. Crispy flaky golden crust was phenomenal. 

A really cool scottish/home cooked comfort food fusion. Friendly waitstaff.

Had a good experience and would definately recommend to others.
Other than the fact my date split right after to go babysit her drunk friend.....lol"}
{"text":"Attended a wedding rehearsal dinner this past weekend @ Cornish Pasty Company and was very impressed.  Prior to receiving the invite I'd never heard of a pasty before - and apparently wasn't pronouncing it right either.  But I soon learned that what you have here is essentially the British version of a calzone - all the goodies are stuffed inside a pastry & baked.  

Cornish Pasty Company truly offers something for everyone - the options for your pasty range from traditional pub fare to indian, jewish deli, seafood & more.  And what they do here they do oh so right - my shepherd's pie pasty was truly remarkable, as were the reuben my dad had & the \"pilgrim\" (think thanksgiving dinner) my wife ordered.  Others at the table also enjoyed the options they went for.

Believe it or not they even have dessert pasties - wifey & I share the caramel apple one, and I had the opportunity to taste the chocolate bread pudding as well, both were really impressive.

As if this weren't enough, they have a phenomenal selection of beers including some nice local selections and all of this is being served up by some super friendly staff in a very casual & fun atmosphere.  

My only complaint? Now I have to go back home to NY and find someplace that makes these because I know I'll be craving one very soon."}
{"text":"Having been to the other locations, I must admit this one takes the cake (or pasty, I suppose. Loved the vibe, the service was great and the Rosemary chicken pasty was hands down the best one I've had yet! I even threw in the banoffee to go (because it's wrong to go and NOT have banoffee). I will be returning for lunch time fixes to this location! It's about to be the perfect patio weather and they have the perfect patio to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"For pasties and beer this place is great. However I give them three stars because I'm not sure they follow through on their advertised vegan accommodations. For one, they have a salad listed as \"available vegan\" yet it still comes with yogurt dressing and is not able to be done vegan because the greens are marinated in yogurt. Also, the vegan pasties I ordered all had cheese. I highly doubt they used vegan cheese for these and the server, nice as she was, did not seem to have the menu knowledge to be able to provide those details. I will admit, these pasties are excellently made, but if you serve a vegan person cheese because you're being willingly deceitful (I'm blaming you management, not the servers) then you definitely don't deserve high marks."}
{"text":"uhhhh this is the best thing everrr!! Banoffee Pie WHO KNEW?! And their signature Pasties should be SIGNIFICANT PASTIES! Excellent! I'm a FAN for sure :))"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I try a new pasty. The rosemary chicken is by far my favorite. The chicken tikka is great if you're feeling Indian food. The peppered steak had an odd flavor and the lamb vindaloo is HOT!!! My favorite side is the broccoli and calliflower bake! Do not pass this place up! You cannot beat the service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"While they might be known for their pasties, I always go right for their Greek salad and tomato soup! They are both so good. Eat in and they have a cool patio and beer selection or take out when in a rush. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been to cornish pasty a few times but finally giving it a review. This is the first time I've been to the Mill location. Theres a sign that says it's cozy inside and they ain't lying. Luckily they have seating outside for us big and tall dudes. 

There's enough variety on the menu to try something different every visit which I've done. Today I tried the Shepard's pie and my friend had the Reuben pasty. Both were delicious, the Shepard's pie came with ground lamb, mash potatoes, veggies, cheese with a side of red wine gravy. The crust was so flaky and moist and when you slather the gravy over it it doesn't get soggy from it. The Reuben was also tasty, it came with chunks of corned beef, sauerkraut, cheese and a side of 1000 island sauce. I don't think you'll go wrong with any one you choose, I've had 5 different ones and they were all consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the low key atmosphere in Old Town. The Dbag factor is low & is family friendly in the afternoons for sure. The food I've had was yummy & happy hour always is a good deal. I'd recommend this place to anyone. My last visit was in the mid of August & I got eaten alive by ants (7 bites) on the outdoor patio but that too has passed. Just an FYI to in the summer months on the patio to keep an eye out. The ants like a little Hispanic lady with their pasty's I guess."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and has tasty beer. I love the atmosphere here the people are ALWAYS friendly even if they're busy. The cornish pasties FILL YOU UP oh my gosh and they are amazing. My favorite one is the Sheppard's Pie, you can never go wrong with that. Their broccoli/cauliflower cheese dish is also huge and my friend and I had trouble finishing everything but in a good way.
Yummy yum yes"}
{"text":"I checked it out based on a reddit post -- thank you! -- and had the vegetarian tandoori pasty during lunch w/ red iced tea. My stomach growled on the way in from the parking lot once the curry welcomed me and I hoped it was the place. It was!

I eat vegan, vegetarian, organic, and all that without being pretentious and have dined at pretentious places that specialize in that sort of thing... 

...and none come close to whatever Cornish Pasty does with the tandoori spices and fake meat made from seitan. AMAZING.

I've eaten my way through India, love anything Thai, and was raised drinking spicy homestyle AZ salsa.

Cornish Tandoori is in my Top 10. The consistency and flavors even tricked my carne friend :)

My newly retired brit friends loved the layout, people watching, and weather. Divine! One had the carne pasty and the other one had a potatoes pasty... fuzzy details as I was more impressed by the layout, music vibe, and friendly crowd... and completely enrapt by my order. Spent my time wondering how to recreate it at home. Perfect spice blend. They should bottle it and sell it; hook me up with a free lunch ;)

Our excellent server, Dean, informed us the architectural design was made by moving 2 mid-century farmhouses from elsewhere on the property up to the walkable street then conjoining them. There's even a tree framed in the middle between restaurant patio and bar. 

Dean was also accommodating when we requested to move tables to enjoy the nice outdoor weather. He gave us no attitude at all; totally nice guy who made an afternoon awesome for my otherwise high maintenance friends. He took pride in his job plus was very patient at explaining menu items, making recommendations, and attentive to our needs. Other staff walked by to constantly refill our drinks and make sure we were taken care of... Very classy lunchtime service.

I noticed indoor bar style seating so you can see how the pasties are made-- great for any boring/awkward date where at least there's something visual to hopefully cue some sort of conversation. If not, then at least you got some scrumptious food out of it. But enough about my dating life. The cure is tandoori!

Sit inside or outside and take in the mellow, Dick Dale surf guitar vibe. Could've sworn we were at a beachside cafe. Reminded me of a Santa Barabara, LA, or San Diego boardwalk-- great food, relaxing environment, soft sunlight, light breeze. I was hooked.

Went back on a different night to check out the beers on tap and wasn't disappointed. Again, friendly, laid-back staff (Bartender: Ed?). He made recommendations and helped me decide on a great craft beer from CO. 

Cornish Pasty is an easy place for family, friends, coworkers, or if you're single without feeling awkward about dining solo. The experiences helped me decide to spend more time in the Dale of Scots, for sure.

I debated throwing this up on Yelp because I kinda like it as an undiscovered hangout. And I'm bad with the names of the staff but they were excellent to me. If more of the right crowd continues to end up here, no doubt it will maintain its calming charm.

Hope this place makes a killing during Spring Training and becomes a mainstay. Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I stepped off the train, hiked to the top of Hayden Butte because it was there, and asked a local on the peak where I should eat. Cornish Pasty Co. was the unequivocal answer. I took them up on the suggestion and have to admit I was blown away. I didn't know I wanted a pasty, but the the Guinness Stew Pasty leaped off the menu at me. Wow. The pastry is the thin, crisp and perfectly browned. The stew was rich, savory, meltingly tender and redolent of rosemary. Paired with a Guinness stout, I didn't want it to end. I have two more nights in Tempe; at least one of those will be spent at Cornish Pasty."}
{"text":"Fun and authentic. Certainly a change from the slew of average restaurants around the valley. Atmosphere is casual and prices are reasonable. It was a bit loud when I went but it was in Tempe. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I got stuck with a caterer we were really disappointed in who didn't provide a tasting until a week before our wedding. Cornish Pasty Co. was available for the same price with the twice the quality!!! We were so honored to have them as our wedding caterers and they were professional and easy to work with. Everyone loved it. No surprises there."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday party a few days ago. The salad is AMAZING. I was unimpressed though with the fact that it did not have a gluten-free menu. The waitress was a doll. It's a cozy place and I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! My fiancé and I are regulars here for not only the amazing food but also the staff! Eddie is the best bartender I've ever experienced. He goes out of his way to make sure all customers feel comfortable and relaxed. We love the neighborhood feel that he truly creates in this bar/restaurant! Whether we are looking to get some food or sit down and have a quick drink, we always feel welcomed and taken care of."}
{"text":"Oh yes! The food is delicious and inexpensive, and the beer list is extensive. Our server tonight was absolutely outstanding. We will be back, I plan on trying everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great environment and wide variety of beer choices, both bottled and on tap. The concept for 90% of the menu is the same...essentially a gourmet \"hot pocket\" type baked sandwich with a flaky croissant-like crust stuffed with a wide selection of fillings for different (mostly savory) flavor profiles.The vibe of the restaurant is very \"old pub\" with wooden bench seating and dim lighting, but they also have a fantastic patio/outdoor bar area.

Cornish Pasty is one of those places with something for everyone. I really appreciate that one entire side of the menu is dedicated to vegan and vegetarian menu items; the spicy asiago is one of my favorites! The soups and desserts are are also equally delicious, and it's always hard to pass up a banoffee pie or caramel apple pasty for dessert."}
{"text":"The beer was good excellent and I enjoyed the upscale bar food. Definitely had the English vibe. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The new Scotsdale location is everything I like about CPC cranked up to 11.  The location is bigger than the ones on University and in Mesa.  They have a good sized patio and a pretty spacious interior that is shiny and new. While still delivery some tasty pasty as always.  We stopped in for lunch the other day and the service was terrific.  The wait seems to be about on par with the other locations. It's not the quickest place to stop for something to eat, but it a great choice.  This location actually has appetizers on the menu which should help out a bit for those who are more impatient and or hungry.

Try :
- Vegetarian Cottage Pie
- Eggplant Parm"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised that they have happy hour all day on Sundays.  There are no specials on the food, but drafts and wine are $1 off and $4 bloody mary's and mimosas.  It was very difficult to decide on which pasty as they have a huge menu  with so many varieties and they all sound good.  I went with the Spicy BBQ Turkey.  It was good, however I would have liked more bacon and jalapeno (seemed like most was gathered in one end).  I would definitely come back, but would try a different one next time.  Also, the service was great... quick, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Firstly got to love a uk themed food place in az. And it is awesome. Live the tin menu. Love the food, love the selection of beers. Makes me a little home sick. But them I remember the winter and I'm ok with misters and 95 degrees at 10:00 at night. 

Keep up the good work. Hope to see many more around the USA"}
{"text":"Visiting from LA, my cousin brought me to get a couple drinks I must say... I'm pretty buzzed and the food is amazing !!!!!!!!!! Gonna come here every time I visit. Cool vibe. Cool people. Thanks !"}
{"text":"Oh how I love Cornish Pasty! I visited this place once about 3 years ago and was so happy to come back on my most recent trip to Phoenix. The history of cornish pasties is fun to read (be sure to check it out on the menu; it describes the origins of this kind of meal dating back to old mining towns... I'll leave that as a cliffhanger) and delicious to enjoy. This restaurant/bar pays tribute to this kind of dish in the best of ways... by creating their own delicious versions!

On the menu, you'll find about 30-40 kind of Cornish pasties ranging from the classic (chicken pot pie, shepherd pie, etc) to the exotic (greek, chicken tikka masala, spicy asiago and more). For those of you who might not know what a Cornish pasty is, it's essentially a mix between a pot pie and a calzone and includes some kind of fillings surrounded by a flaky crust/shell (in fewer words, it's a savory pie). My wife ordered the cheese and onion pasty (filled with potatoes, rutabaga, English cheddar and onions) while I ordered the chicken pot pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery, and onion in a rosemary and chicken gravy). Each pasty is made from scratch each day, so the result is something truly fresh and delicious! The chicken pot pie, for instance, was loaded with savory flavors. And the portions are so large that you'll either leave feeling stuffed, or (in our case) leave with half a pasty for leftovers.

In addition to pasties, the menu also includes salads, soups, appetizers and desserts, as well as a good number of options for beer, wine and spirits. Ambiance here is also enjoyable, especially in the evening when the weather is a bit cooler and the lighting more intimate.

Again, I was so glad to be able to visit this place on a local trip and will certainly be sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The Guinness beef stew pasty was so good. They are so large they can feed two with a side salad. Their selection of tap beer was very good."}
{"text":"Love this establishment. Funny staff, open seating, full bar, vegan foods, dog friendly patio. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a diverse restaurant/bar. Side note: The Scottsdale location is great for large groups compared to the Mill location."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious, service was good, atmosphere was great. Definitely go here if you get the chance! It's so unique too! You can't find this food anywhere else."}
{"text":"The amazing aroma of curry greets you at the door! Whatever you are craving, you can find a pasty that will delight! They have an amazing cider selection. Prices are reasonable. Staff is very friendly! Try sitting on the patio under the misters."}
{"text":"what happened? 
my favorite place has gone down hill fast, once a favorite , tho now no desire to return, the staff had an unfortunate candor, did not want to do anything, very rude, copped an attitude,waited 20+ minutes,and no server came, to great us,no menu had to seat myself,no water, then no service, had to find a so called waitress,busy rolling napkins( tho not ON anymore?)  asked to order something got a 'tude, and our server complained,because she overheard our private conversation,
cornish pasty,i feel you have lost my patronage, was not happy my last trip in. Do not  know if I shall return,  I am english,and have spent many years in England, and this is a shame of a place,i used to come here when i  had  a craving, now i will make the treck to another english restaurant, at least there i get service!"}
{"text":"I wasnt as crazy about this place as our friend who recommended it but it was generally good.they were out of the salmon and we ate at 5pm..disappointing as thats really what we went for.instead got the eggplant parmesan which Our party liked and i got the mushroom walnut soup which was fine.some of the music played was way too chaotic..the sound was a mix of styles..some motown some r and b and obviously some screechy hard sounding music..couldnt talk over it and unpleasant."}
{"text":"Spacious location.
Well-lit compared to other locations.  
A seat yourself restaurant prior to the dinner rush. 
Nice looking crew with a friendly personality.  Hipster-esque. All ages are welcome though. Great selection of beers. 
Even better selection of pasties! I've tried three fourths of the menu. Everything is delicious. Even their salads when I was on a gluten-free diet! How can you go wrong with homemade pasty dough and ingredients??!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Oven Chips, I guess that's how English people are calling fries for.  Pasta Salad. Peppered Steak.  The service was super slow, sat at bar and couldn't get service for nearly 20 minutes.  Good place for the food, but not good if I have to wait that long to get a glass of water."}
{"text":"The other location is one of my favorite restaurants and this one is just as good. We had a very large party and the service was just as good as if we had only 2 people. They kept drinks full, food came out very quickly, and it was delicious as usual. I had a vegetarian spicy asiago pasty and loved it. Most of the people in the group hadn't been here before and they all loved it. Not one person didn't seem to like the food. I would never think of getting a salad here with the amazing pasty's but someone did and it actually looked great as well!"}
{"text":"One night after a Spring Training game, I felt adventurous and wanted to try something new.  This was when I discovered Cornish Pasty Co.  I actually had no idea what a cornish pasty was and had to wikipedia it.  Basically it is an English pastry where you place uncooked filling into a pastry crust and bake it.  That's simple enough.

Upon driving up to Cornish Pasty Co. at night, I noticed that the parking lot was fairly small and not well lit.  While walking up to the actual place, I loved the layout of the place.  There were dining tables on the inside and outside of the restaurant.  There was also a bar on the inside as well as the outside.  This is a pretty genius idea since Arizona temperature is crazy hot.  The bf and I sat on stools at the bar that was outside.  We experienced great weather that night.  There were also customers who sat in the outside bar area and brought their dogs along with them while dining.  These were not service dogs and they were allowed.  Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but if you can't discipline your dog/dogs, please don't bring them.  The whole time we were trying to enjoy our dinner, these two dogs were just barking and jumping up and down the whole time.  Even the owners couldn't calm and control their dogs.  It was actually kind of annoying.  I didn't realize I was at a dog park.

At the bar, we were immediately greeted by the bartender and he handed us the food menu as well.  I already knew before we got there that I wanted to try a pasty.  However, when I was browsing the menu, holy crap!  There were about 25 different pasties to choose from!  When they call it the Cornish Pasty Co., they were not kidding.  On top of that, there were also soups, salads, and appetizers that you could order.  I asked the bartender what their best seller was, but he was of no real help.  He basically said that all of the pasties are great.  After looking over the menu a gazillion times, I finally decided to go with The Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) which has a steak, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga filling along with a red wine gravy or ketchup on the side for only $8.75.  The bf ordered the Tandoori Wings appetizer ($6.50) which is basically chicken wings baked in tandoori marinade along with a side of lemon mint yogurt dip.  Tandoori wings at a restaurant that mainly serves English food?  Hmmm... 

The food came out at a decent time.  We didn't have to wait too long.  The Tandoori Wings came out first since it is an appetizer.  I was actually blown away by how good the wings were!  Wow!  The four pieces of wings were not enough.  The dish also came with some cucumber slices as well as tomatoes.  It was really hard not to devour all of the wings.  I had to remind myself that this was my bf's order and not mine so instead, I started eating the cucumbers and tomatoes for him.  When my pasty came, it was very hot and hearty.  I actually thought the pasty was okay.  It wasn't anything super amazing and it wasn't bad either.  The Oggie kind of reminded me of a puff pastry being filled with beef stew and being baked.  I think I enjoyed the crust of the pastry more than I did the filling.

Overall, the service and food was good and the prices even better!  I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!  Just watch out for Cujo."}
{"text":"So unbelievably good, the pilgrim pasty is my favorite and no matter how delicious their other pastys sound, I have to get it every time or I know I'll regret it.  It's so good heated up the next day too! Their desserts are always comforting and inspired and just the right about of sweetness.  I still dream about a banana pudding I had there years ago."}
{"text":"Eh. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. I think Cornish Pasty is trendy and that's why people are flocking yo it. I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty. It was just all right, a little dry though. It did have chunks of chicken and a decent amount of veggies. I left most of the crust on my plate. I thought it was bland."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff was great...especially Michelle our server!  Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food ok service.  I liked the concept.  Never had a pasty. Service was just ok.  Had to ask for drink refills and stuff. But worth the trip"}
{"text":"Well I am from England and I think this place is totally awesome. 
Absolutely great, and I`m English and I should know.
The Pasties are delicious, and the beer list is good. 
Nice ambiance and good service. Love it."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try their newest location and as the four stars say, Yay, I'm a fan!

I've always liked pastys and have eaten them in places as diverse as Northern Michigan, Canada, England, and Northern California. That's why I'm excited that this local restaurant is thriving here in Arizona.

The Scottsdale location is nice and big and although I was here for lunch I would love to go back in the evening and try a few of the beers on the menu. The patio is very comfortable with misters to keep it cool and the interior looks great with lots of seating for both large and small groups.

Cornish Pasty Co. is definitely a great new addition to the oldtown Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Went here with a huge group of friends. Loved the food. I got the chicken salad... I know why not the Pastry I am to picky. I was told if you call the day before they will make changes! The server was great."}
{"text":"Every pasty I've tried has been wonderful. Full of flavor and unique. The bar has an eclectic array of beer to choose from. The overall atmosphere is relaxed, the building is always clean and the staff always friendly and attentive. The Scottsdale location is by far, my favorite."}
{"text":"P-ay-stee, P-ah-stee, or P-aaaa-stee, however you say pasty- it is good stuff.  When I went here with a large group of work friends, we found many interesting ways to say \"pasty\" and after the beers started  flowing even more ha!  If you are very hungry this is the place to go!  A pasty is similar to a calzone or an empanada but with a thin-ish pastry dough as opposed to a bread/pizza dough around the outside.  You can fill it up with any kind of yumminess you would like and the menu is full of delicious options.  

The drink menu is decent with a good selection of beers and I am a fan of their house cocktails considering 3 out of 4 of them have gin :)

The service can be slow, but they are generally nice and informative.  The patio is great for groups with bench style seating and picnic tables.  Two historic homes make up the building and  inside there is a view of the kitchen and the staff usually waves hi, which is very pleasant and inviting!"}
{"text":"It's been a number of years since I lived in Arizona, but a friend told me I couldn't miss Cornish Pasty on my next visit. The dark green tiling set a neat mood and really fit the tone of the place. Living in Colorado has me spoiled with good beer, but Jenessa made the suggestion of a local Goldwater Birthday Suit IPA That did not disappoint. Her service was stellar and her recommendation of a Carne Adovda pasty absolutely made me feel like I was back home in Arizona. Fabulous food and good beer, I will definitely make this a regular stop on my visits Home and hope to see a Cornish Pasty popping up in Denver sometime soon!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the staff was friendly. This is my new favorite spot. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie pasty."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. Comfort food at its best. Consistently solid service, cold beer, great appetizers, and every pasty has been awesome!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Co is fire! Definitely a new favorite spot! The party is just right and veggie cottage pie was amazing. The vegetarian meat substitute they use is good I didn't even notice a difference. The staff is friendly and the place is nice and clean. When you walk in the building is set up like a home so you feel like your in dinning room which makes it even more cozy. Also I like the fact that you can sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare the pasty. Highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Young blonde female bartender is the rudest server I have ever encountered.  Me and a few girlfriends went in for a drink or two. It was our first stop of the night and had friends from out of town with us. It was my first time there.   She was so rude to my girlfriend and in front of many other people loudly tried to call her out on not leaving a tip.  We were not even done yet and still had another drink and the same friend was ordering food still so she was as usual going to tip at the end of the meal/drinks ?? Which seems pretty normal, I have never not tipped nor known my friend not to tip. I have never in my life heard someone say anything like that to a customer even if the customer was wrong and wasn't tipping (again we we're just beginning not finished yet) but to be pointed at and spoken (loudly) to that way in front of other customers was insane. I wish I knew her name but she wasn't memorable aside from her rudeness. I hope she is just young and new to this and just needs some experience to learn some manners and etiquette. I was shocked by her words to be honest. The place is prob good and seems to get good reviews but thanks to the bar tender we won't be back."}
{"text":"Seriously a must in Old Town! The staff is super friendly and helpful with picking a perfect pasty and beer pairing. I will definitely be back to try more options."}
{"text":"We had the Shepard pie pasty and is was a wonderful walk down merry gold lane 
Our bartenders were good at service n stuff.  All n all super cool."}
{"text":"Solid food, small place but we'll worth the trip...turkey was fresh, so was roast...a plus.."}
{"text":"Their tomato soup is highly underrated!! It's served with homemade bread and butter which is delicious to dunk in your soup. All of their pasty options are incredible too. Cornish is always a great spot for lunch or dinner or even just a drink."}
{"text":"Sarah was the best server! She was very attentive! This place looks like it had a nice cleaning! Very impressed with the service and the appearance of the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Great comfort food! They have a huge selection of vegetarian pastys which are all delicious. They're selection of beers is impressive and you can find many to pair with any pasty. Great place!"}
{"text":"In town on a vacation weekend.  Met my family over here from England ...driving by and saw the sign and our car was drawn to it.  We were all SO impressed by the food...absolutely perfect.  We are debating moving here...knowing this is here will definitely draw us back.  Food great, ale great, prices and service too.  Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Feel good food for sure. Started with a bowl of spinach and walnut soup. Ordered the shepherds pie pasty. Yum!  I only wish these were smaller in size so you could try more than one."}
{"text":"We came last night around 9:30 and there were just a few people. I can't remember our server's name but he was friendly and explained the whole concept to us. 

I got the Carne Adovada and my mom got the Cottage Pie (Shepard's Pie but with beef instead of lamb). They were both very good, although I thought mine was a bit more unique; her's tasted like the shepard's pie I make at home. 

They par-bake each pasty to make the wait time shorter when you order it, which I definitely appreciate, but I dislike both swiss and bleu cheese that took a ton of the really good sounding options off the table instantly.

Each pasty ranges $10-15 dollars, and does not come with any sides but I couldn't even finish a whole one so I still think a pretty good value. 

This location has a very cool indoor/outdoor bar that I would love to come back and try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing like the other two locations- but the Scottsdale Cornish is special, because it's located in what was two older homes."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cornish Pasty, but this downtown location is so small that even myself - a very skinny girl - felt claustrophobic! Myself and my parents had paid for parking just to go here, but ended up going to a different location. Very dark inside. More bar-ish than the other locations, which is understandable for downtown Tempe. However, when I go to these restaurants, I will likely go to one of the other two."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! When I first moved to the valley I was given a list of great local places to try from a client and Cornish was at the top of the list! The first time I had the Ruben Pasty all we could talk about during dinner was how amazing every bite tasted. I now take anyone who hasn't been there before, from locals to friends and family from out of town. My friends and I have a Pasty almost weekly. If you haven't tried the Cornish Past yet you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded our expectations, we ended up at the Cornish Pasty after a long afternoon of bar hoping and this was our last stop. We ordered the vindaloo pasty and the Guinness pasty and they were delicious. Loved the ambiance and our bartender/hostess Riley was very personable and made the whole experience unforgettable, she even ran out to meet us at our taxi when I forgot my credit card! Looking forward to our next visit to Arizona and to the Cornish Pasty!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the world. It is the epitome of comfort food. The bangers and mash with the red wine gravy is amazing. The environment is relaxed and welcoming to all. You cannot go wrong. Quality quality quality"}
{"text":"2nd time here and ordered the turkey and stuffing, and he had the guiness; both excellent.
Sitting at the kitchen offers the best experience, the staff work very hard. 
You cant beat all day happy hour on Sunday!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location of Cornish Pasty. It was better lit and spacious. We sat so that we could see them make the pasties. Very filling! Took some home. Went here for Valentine's Day and they ran out of some ingredients, but that's okay as we expected it to be busy. I've been back since and I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the Cornish pasties matter of fact whenever I have someone visit I go and take them to this place. It does have a history behind it it is almost like a European style calzone for people that are Italian. I hope that made sense. When my friend comes in from California I have her pick me up pastie to-go and voice and  what a treat."}
{"text":"As one writer wrote, the furniture is uncomfortable; picnic style no backs.  My husband and I had the lamb and mint pasty and the \"Oggie.\"  Both were dry, heavy on potatoes.  The beef in the Oggie was tough and tasteless.  The cole slaw was merely shredded cabbage with mayonnaise.  No tang or crunch.  Looked intriguing, but if you are there for the food and not the bar scene, it isn't much."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have never wrote a review on yelp but this place was reason enough to start. It's pub like atmosphere and the food was some of the best I have tried. I travel a lot and I like when I find places that are not only original but they have great flavors. The staff was nice and the restaurant has an fully open kitchen which was neat. You were able to watch the cooks making pasties right in front of you. They even like to chat it up while they are working which makes you feel less like a spectator and more like a part of the picture."}
{"text":"As a fan of the Tempe location, I was disappointed with my experience at CP Scottsdale. Our food took quite a while considering the place was near empty. The pasty my fiancé ordered was unavailable and he had to choose another. My pasty can out cold and very very dry. My gravy tasted like literal soap- not a comparison, it left a very base and soapy aftertaste. 
We love Cornish, so we'll probably stick to Tempe. Great concept and menu, just a poor execution this time around. 

Also worth noting, a kitchen worker blurted out \"THIS JOB BLOWS\" and then disappeared. It was entertaining enough to bump them from 1.5 to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews - so delicious! Can easily split one pasty between 2 people if you're not super hungry.

Pilgrim 5/5 - my favorite! Tastes like Thanksgiving all rolled into one with the cranberry sauce on the side.
Chicken pot pie 4/5 - a bit too salty.
Italian 4/5 - very meaty.

Will definitely come back if we return to Scottsdale. Those flaky, buttery crusts are divine!!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for something different to eat this is the place......I had a chicken Greek pasty....it was excellent....we stopped for lunch and as we were driving by we saw a decent crowd....so we stopped to see what they were giving away Lol.....we enjoyed our choices.....it is a laid back place to enjoy the day....so everything was good and the experience was most enjoyable......"}
{"text":"Not much has changed over the few years including the fact that there are still no TV sets. The prices are about $9-$11 for a pasty and they still are very good and simple. Tried the eggplant parmesan version and this was a winner. The crispy eggplant was stuffed inside along with zucchini and a few other veggies and marinara to dip. Always a solid choice and still open late and open seating too. Happy Hour is all day Sunday, but a buck off really doesn't help much."}
{"text":"I love pastys. However I am on a gluten free diet to help with some issues I have been having. No allergy just sensitive. I went there last night and ordered a few gluten friendly items including soup and bread. Asked the waiter for gluten friendly bread along with my soup. I ate all the bread as it was so good and surprised it was gluten free. Turns out the waiter gave me the regular bread on accident. She apologized but it really could have been so much worse for her. They need to be more careful l. Wish this had not happened."}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant while driving by on Goldwater and thought...Hum!  What's this.  Really cute from the outside!  I thought the benches could use a cushion on them.  They were really hard wood to sit on.  Our server was OK, but wish she would have had a bit more enthusiasm because the food deserved it!  We ordered 5 things in total.  I had the salmon Pasty my friend had the Pork pasty with apple (not much mint), potatoes and I don't remember what else.  Then I had the greek sale, which was really good, fresh lettuce which was cold and crisp and a great maybe greek dressing.  Half a salad was plenty for lunch.  My friend had a cup of soup with stilton cheese and she said, it too, was yum!  We just had iced tea, pretty color, a little heavy on the water!
The reason why I am giving it a 4 star is because of the incredibly loud heavy decibel music which was really annoying if you wanted to have a conversation.  If they could tone that down, i'd give it a 5 start because what we ate for this type of food was delicious, fun idea, and lots of choices! PS, the Salmon pasty was so big, I brought half of it home tonite and now my husband even got to taste this treat!"}
{"text":"Love this place. All of the food I have tasted is so good, great atmosphere, beer selections are great too. My mom loves this place too!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to warm up to this place, but it's solid. They've got some consistent, good quality food unlike any other place in the Phoenix area. It has a very casual atmosphere and decent service. They normally have some cool classic rock playing in the background. Bonus points for Coke products."}
{"text":"First timer.  Fun and tasty.  good service,  great location in Scottsdale west of old town."}
{"text":"I called in today to place a to go order and was placed on hold for 40 damn minutes.  This is unacceptable by all means. I usually love Cornish Pasty, but this location has no customer service.  I guess my money is not good enough for them. I will never ever dine at this location again.  You ought to be a shame of yourself."}
{"text":"Charming bar with smaller menu than the University locale. Parking was difficult to find. Metered parking, but we finally found a parking lot with instructions to feed a machine and number parking slots and got situated. 
WARNING: Make sure that you pay up or you will be fined. On our way back to our car, we found the parking police at work.

This location is more like a bar counter. We were disappointed that we couldn't order our broccoli and cauliflower casserole, but our Cornish Pasties were not a disappointment. I got the Cajun Chicken and my friend got the Royale. 

The Cajun was definitely spicy and not for the faint of heart. The blackened chicken was flavorful. I loved my crust. 

My friend's Royale looked delicious as it oozed with cheese. 

They had several beers on tap including Guiness! Beer and pasties, perfect bar food scene."}
{"text":"I visited Cornish Pasty Co for the 2nd time tonight- first time sitting inside. My boyfriend and I came to place a take-out order, and waited at the bar looking into the kitchen and prep area for our order. Out of the 11 visible kitchen employees, 6 of them were not wearing hair nets and 5 of them were not wearing gloves. One female employee had her long hair down, and the others had longer hair and bears. All of these employees were handling and prepping food. As someone who has contracted food poisoning before, as well as finding hair in my food, I will not be returning to an establishment that has such abysmal food handling policies. Yuck.

Update in response to the restaurant- the other 5 employees without hairnets were men without hats. No hats, no hair net. I did see the employee with the hat and beard net. I also saw the employee slicing onions with no hair or hair net, the employee slicing potatoes with no hair or hair net, and the runner with no hat or hair net"}
{"text":"I love the food here
But seriously on a Saturday
They were out of everything
And the service just sucks!
People working everywhere but takes forever to get food!
I love this concept and usually willing to overlook the bad service
But not being out of everything ! Come on this is a business at least be stocked up"}
{"text":"Decided to try somewhere new for dinner tonight and was not disappointed. All the appetizers, entrées, and desserts were excellent. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and fun warm atmosphere for a more casual dining experience. $4 Irish Car Bombs all day every day!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about them.  It's not a fancy place and the wine selection is not the best but the food is fresh and well made. I suggest eating at the counter and watching them make the pasties.  Great place for groups too.  Lots of outdoor dining."}
{"text":"$4 Irish Car bombs! I had 5... Cool outdoor seating area. The pasty's were really good and filling. Would definitely recommend for a casual dinner/drinks"}
{"text":"Local chain that is expanded from an initial location in Tempe to being all around the Valley now and for good reason!  What's a variety everyone can find something they like and a great beer menu too. I recommend the salmon."}
{"text":"So glad they opened this up in Scottsdale!  They have a great patio and it is a decent size!  They have a variety of different pasties to choose from.  The pasty itself is so fresh and tasty, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Cool place to chill at and people watch on Mill :-)"}
{"text":"I tried the Mill Ave location about a week after the University Dr location and they are both unique. This location is definitely smaller but in the middle of all things Mill Ave. They have a small patio that is nice to sit on and people watch. However it was very windy and cold the night I went and they don't have outdoor heaters so be mindful of that. But for being a busy weekend night the service was quick and attentive. 

The food was good! My friends compare a pasty to a fancy Hotpocket and I have to agree. This time I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala Pasty and was satisfied. The chicken was warm and tender and the sauce was great. Only thing I'd change would be to add more sauce as it tasted dry in some parts. 

If you're in the mood, be sure to try their Irish Car Bombs for only $5!"}
{"text":"I've toyed with my rating on this one. On one hand, I've received questionable service at this location a few times. On the other hand, I LOVE everything about this pub. When potatoes are your favorite food (like they are mine) and you could eat soup even when it's 115 degrees out (like I do), there's no better place than Cornish. Oh, did I mention it's a dream for vegetarians? Seriously, you'll be impressed with the number of options they have. 

This is good, hearty food that hits the spot. My go-to meal can be any variation of the eggplant parm pasty, the cream of leek, potato, and stilton soup, or the Greek pasty. Great for splitting as the portions are huge. Particularly on a chilly, Arizona winter night, I love grabbing a bench, sipping on a pint, and wishing I was half as cool as the hipster staff here.

Five stars: all day, err day."}
{"text":"I've been here a ton of times. It was a favorite over the summer before the many pool parties that Old Town has to offer. While my typical spot is the Old Town location, I have also been to the one in Tempe and the food is consistent.

As for the menu, the primary items are all pasties. They are similar to pot pies and have a nice golden crust and each comes with a dipping sauce. My favorite is the Lovely bit of Salmon, which is a healthier option on the menu and has asparagus inside and comes with a dill dipping sauce. The spicy BBQ turkey is also very good. Finally, try pairing your pasty with the lemonade drink from the bar. With fresh muddled strawberries, you can't go wrong!

Bottom line:  This place has great food, a a tasty drink on the menu, and has discounted partially cooked menu items that can be taken home to enjoy at your own dinner table."}
{"text":"We've been saying we wanted to try this restaurant for years! My husband loves meat pies of any kind! Even with a GPS we still passed this restaurant! It's not a small restaurant either. Very cozy cute comfortable atmosphere. We were waited on quickly. We got our drinks and I thought I should have got a appetizer 
 But I'm glad I didn't. My pasty was so big I could only eat half. My husband got the  Royale pasty. But he didn't have it with the thousand island sauce he asked for the wine sauce, which was very good! He loved it so much he ordered 2 to go!! We also ordered a Carmel Apple pasty for dessert later at home!! 
 We can't wait to go back and try the other pasties ! So many wonderful choices. Our server was a young blonde, she was friendly and always there when we needed anything! ."}
{"text":"I like this place. You should try the hot pocket. It's my favorite. And oh wow, there's a ton a sexy bearded men there. Pretty great. Kinda wish they had some more local drafts. 
Carne Adovada pasty gives me a spicy foods boner"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Greek Pasty with a side of tzatziki.  Very delicious.  The pastry of the pasty was unlike anything I had ever had - Yummy.  

The restaurant is very small, but can get uncomfortably crowded.  After being there several times I'm giving it only four stars because the service can sometimes be lack luster to be painfully slow.  The food, however, is great.  I see they have expanded to other locations in the valley and hope to try them soon."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food and service is always amazing! I can't speak for any other locations, but the ambiance at the Scottsdale location is great. You can seat yourself wherever you want and they have plenty of indoor, outdoor, and bar seating. Sometimes it gets very crowded, but it never gets too loud.

The pasties are amazing. The crust is flaky and delicious and they have so many different options for fillings! They also have LOTS of vegetarian options which is a huge plus. The Veggie Oggie is one of the best that I've had - potatoes, mushroom, rutabaga and onions. Last time I was there I decided to try their soup (cream of potato and leek) and I was not disappointed!

As far as drinks are concerned, I'm not a big beer person, but they have a fairly good selection of ciders and signature cocktails. 

Overall, I love going here and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great service prices are right and food rocks!! I'll be back this place makes pasties the way there supposed to be."}
{"text":"If you want a sandwich then go. Not bad but noisy. Prices ok. Service poor. Beer selection good but server had no clue. I wanted a decent dinner but noise and service made it less then happy. Was walking from the valley ho but there are better choices for dinner...Maybe ok for lunch"}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise, we stopped by here 100% by accident and what a happy accident it was.

Kind of funky and a little bit odd in serving entrees inside puff pastry, but I loved it so much, apparently now I want to eat all my meals inside of a puff pastry!  The Mexican I had with pork, potatoes and egg was delicious!  My girls all had chicken varieties and loved them as well...plus a great selection of beers, this is a place to go.

Good service, sitting outside with great food what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Sad to give such a poor rating to a remarkable restaurant. The food here is spectacular but the service was deplorable. Flippant attitudes and slow all around. Did not seem to be much reason either...not too busy. The only server worth a good mention is \"goth girl\". We got to watch her work her tail off and be kind to her patrons. 
We usually eat at the mesa location and we will not switch that up again. This was a shit stack of an experience."}
{"text":"I did not particularly enjoy the food after being here 3 times. Maybe I'm not cut out for English pub food. Finding a healthy option was tough and everything is heavy.

The service was good by the bartender the first time on a weeknight but the one time I went on a Saturday night the service was remarkably bad. We had to constantly ask for our servers attention. Maybe that is another British customary thing I'm not a fan of or maybe it was just an off night. 

Very cool place though aesthetically."}
{"text":"It was our first time to Cornish Pasty Co. and it did not dissapoint. One thing to keep in mind is it takes 15-20 min for them to cook one of their fresh pastys so if you are hungry make sure to order a side salad to start to help hold you over.  Their lime pesto house salad dressing was amazing!!  The food was great and the huge outdoor seating will keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"The pasties here are delicious! This is a little hole in the wall, but definitely worth checking out for their version of British pub grub. I got the vegan portobello mushroom pasty, it was wonderful. Mushrooms, Daiya cheese and gravy. The garlic chips were crisp and oily and awesome. They even had a macaroni and cheese pasty that looked amazing.  Nice assortment of beers and ciders as well."}
{"text":"What a great little spot. I came in here for my birthday with a girlfriend last week and it is so cute! We were a little confused at first because the seating isn't traditional (at least that's what we gathered) you just walk in and pick a spot. 

Our server was so sweet. I dont remember her name but she was great. We ordered the meatballs which we were super excited to try and after we ordered them she came over and let us know they were sold out. We were a little disappointed but she already had a second recommendation for us which I appreciated. We got the wings instead and they were delicious! The sauce was so sweet and tangy. I loved them.

I ordered the chicken vindaloo pasty and my friend ordered the bangers and mash. Both were super good! They are basically just glorified hot pockets and I don't have any problem with that! 

I didnt order a drink but I did notice that they had a great beer selection. 

Great food, great service and priced fairly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just don't see the hype in this food - I've been here multiple times, trying something different each time, and I'm still left unimpressed."}
{"text":"This location was set up more like a bar which I sat at as it overlooks the street, great for people watching. Already impressed with the Lamb Vindaloo pasty I asked the bartender to recommend another spicy one and he suggested the Carne Adovada which was stuffed with pork in New Mexican red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chilies and cheddar. It came with a side of sour cream and salsa and it was delicious. Sticking with the 32oz beers this time I tried a Kilt Lifter which went down a treat."}
{"text":"Decided to  try this location from  the reviews. Tried the Tempe location but walked and and straight out.  This place has a totally different vibe. I wanted to come in and try 

The noise from the street plus the crowd and the music does not lend itself to a quiet romantic moment or for any type of serious conversation. So be warned this  is not a quiet conversation place. It is a fun place 

Had the cottage pie pasties. They were good.  Although my one suggestion would be skip the gravy. Terrible"}
{"text":"Amazing tandoori wings! Indian guys and girls, this is the place if you're looking for the homely tandoori chicken!

Also try the tikka masala pasty!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a gooey, meat and cheese filled pocket of bread? Those people who are obsessed with working out, that's who. I could never bring my mom here because she'd make me go on a walk afterwards and complain about how many calories she ate for at least the rest of the night. Brutal. 

If you aren't one of those people, this place is for you. Don't come here and order a salad. That is just sad. 

Now for my favorites: The Pilgrim and the Lovely Bit O' Salmon. I have ventured out of the box and tried others, but I always come back to these. They are perfect. 

P.S. If you've never had the pleasure of a Scottish Egg, for the love of god, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the Cornish Pasty. The food? INCREDIBLE. The ambiance? PERFECT. The beer selection? EXCELLENT. 

Honestly, a pasty is a glorified hot pocket... But these are beyond delicious. The vibe is cool, the patio is large, the food is consistently great, and the beer is cold. 

What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The open windows to the street are awesome.... and the Carne Adovada Pasties r freaken delicious. 1st time earing here and definitely b back."}
{"text":"Seeing this on my yelp review made me realize that I haven't been here in over a month! I must go, immediately! 

I always get the vegetarian Mexican Cornish pasty. SO good. They use quorn ground beef, which is by far my favorite \"fake\" meat on the shelves in the store. The best part about quorn is that they do not use soy. They use mushrooms! It tastes very authentic and finally, FINALLY, you don't have to be that weirdo that orders the only vegetarian menu on the item. You get to indulge in the meat and taters attitude of the rest of your table. 

I highly recommend getting the tea with lemon. It is quite different with almost a bread-like taste. The kettle alone makes the tea worthwhile."}
{"text":"Low rating based 100% on the service. Food is great. If you don't mind horrible, slow and un-attentive service from staff who aren't very professional, then go by all means. The food is great. I've been twice now. Was waiting to write my review to be fair and give this 2 solid shots. HORRIBLE service! Waited 10 minutes for a water. Ordered an app that came out after the meals. The waitress didn't check on us once during out meal. We had to physically get up out of our chairs to ask for drink service. Then, we had to get up again to ask for the check. This place needs major staff improvement. Sad, because the food is solid."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise in Scottsdale! Absolutely delicious pasties - countless choices for everyone - veggies, vegans, omnivores - this place has it all. Incredibly light, flaky pastry surrounding the tastiest fillings I have ever had. Relaxed atmosphere, indoor and outdoor dining, hip & kind staff, and, above all, great food. Be sure to order an Arnold Palmer, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice patio outside and cool interior. Feels like home. The service sometimes takes a while but the food is very good. Must try the bread pudding afterwards. My favorite pasty is the Greek. The tomato soup is amazing and the salads are great. If you like beer, they have some amazing variety and always change it up."}
{"text":"My wife and I came up for a desert to end our date night. Parents of 4 girls with not a ton of free nights for a date. We told our server about our excitement for finally having a night to ourselves. When the bill came, the desert was on the house. Class act! Well done as always Cornish!"}
{"text":"We FINALLY made it to Cornish Pasty and boy was I happy that we did!!!! If you're  feeling like unwinding with some traditional English comfort food and friends, this is the place to go. It was so fantastic. Be prepared to seat yourself --They have a ton of indoor and outdoor seating! The menu was a little overwhelming with so many options {tons of vegetarian options too!} to choose from and they ALL looked delicious! I started with the garden salad {Their homemade lemon pesto vinaigrette was aaamazing!}, the chips with garlic AND jalapeño {if you like a kick} are a must and the Cheesesteak pasty was everything that I wanted and more, packed with grilled steak, onions, peppers, mushrooms and creamy cheese, served with a red wine gravy or mustard sauce for dipping (I got both because I'm a sauce freak!). They also have $4 Irish Car Bombs everyday if you feel like getting a little wild! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have had Pasties made from scratch by a neighbor who actually worked in a mine and ate them warmed on the manifold of an engine.  These were almost like the home made Pasty, but really much better.  The pastry was a light golden color done to a crisp.  Nothing doughy about it.  We also had the Liver Pate with bread.  If the bread had been toasted it would have been perfect.  But we enjoyed the taste.  Lovely.  Good service as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there last night. I fought her all the way to the restaurant because I am not a fan of British food, but she prevailed. Here is the thing, I found out that a Pasty is just like a huge Empanada. If I would have known this, I would have definitely tried the restaurant sooner. 

The wrap or crust was super flaky and excellently prepared. She had the Shepherds Pie Pasty and I had the Lamb and Mint Pasty. The fillings were super tasty and the wine reduction sauce was exactly what it needed. For dessert, we had the Banofee Pie. The caramel was made in-house and reminded me of good dulce de leche that I have eaten in the past. We would have given the place five stars but the meatball appetizer was crazily over-salted. 

All in all we had a really nice time. Other incidentals, the servers were very friendly and informative and there is bench seating on the inside as well as a large patio seating area outside. It was not super busy when we went, but I can definitely see the place getting packed on a Saturday night. So, plan ahead."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I had the mushroom, walnut and spinach soup, the jalapeño curry bean dip, and the banoffee pie. The soup was savory and flavorful, and the graham cracker crust on the banoffee pie was  *to die for*. Lots of seating available. 

I don't know if it's always like this, but definitely don't go on a Sunday if you're in a hurry to get somewhere. Our food and dessert both took a while, we were there almost two full hours."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this new location for over a year.  Time seems to be passing so fast.  Finally I was able to have a chance yesterday, so I tried something new.  I tried the Porky and a bite of the Chicken Tikka Massala.  I liked the Chicken Tikka Massala much better than my choice, but since I was sharing mine with my mom, I had to be mindful of spiciness.  I am sure my mom wouldn't have liked the spiciness of the CTM, I on the other hand loved it.  I will have it on my next visit.  I also want to check out the Steak and Mushroom one.  The location and decor is really nice.  The outside bar area looks really cool."}
{"text":"Its \"ok\". Food is pretty heavy--not for anyone who likes healthy or restricted diet. Great ambiance, good bar and patio. Terrible service and kept having to ask for things from water to silverware to our tab...and it wasn't even a particularly busy night..."}
{"text":"Thought this location in Scottsdale would be snotty and completely different from the one on University.  Well I was wrong.  This location is better, the University one needs some major things fixed, like the fact if it rains it leaks underneath the wall or floor and you will be sitting in a puddle by the end of your meal, or you go to pick up your purse and it will be soaked.

This location has completely the same atmosphere, much more space, and a wonderful outside seating area and bar.  Plus I didn't notice anything that needed fixing yeah!  $4 car bombs yes please! 
 
I've had many of the vegetarian options before, but gotta say the carne adovado is to die for I just can't order anything else now.  I always need the Mexican/Spanish style pastys with chiles, salsa, hot sauce etc.... That I have yet to try a traditional pasty.  I'm sure they are all great and really want and will try the pilgrim next time!
  
I mean I'm a AZ native I guess home cooked comfort food pasties don't catch my eye, but I will expand my horizons and give a traditional pasty a try.   Ohhhhh...... and my bf loves the cajun chicken which is also amazing.  Oh and don't forget to get a cup of leek soup! Now that is a must have every time now,  its so delicious!  Dreaming of it now!  Good service, some servers always seem glum and never smile but still nice staff.  Takes a while to make a pasty but you can have plenty of beer or car bombs while you wait!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been to the Tempe location a couple of times and much prefer the Tempe location. I haven't ever dined in at this (Scottsdale) location, but have ordered to go several times with co-workers. All of us have commented that we become less impressed with the place after each time we order. More times than not, the order is incorrect (missing pasties, missing dressing, missing soups, no bread...) The staff isn't particularly friendly and the food is inconsistent at best - sometimes the Tomato soup is to die for, other times it is over salted and bland. They are inconsistent in what constitutes a bowl vs. a cup of soup (you would think they would have containers for each size...no, apparently the portion is whatever the cook feels like you should get). Staff definitely doesn't appreciate being asked about this. Our orders typically amount to $80-$100 so you would imagine that our regular patronage would be appreciated, but this just doesn't seem to be the case. We were ordering from this location at least once a week, after multiple less than great experiences, not one of my co-workers have suggested that we order from this place in quite some time."}
{"text":"4 stars for food... 3 stars for service! 

I finally got myself here to give it a try. It was definitely worth it, there were plenty of options that were vegetarian and even vegan friendly. 

There was a group of us, so we had to wait to be seated until we all arrived. That was not that atypical so we weren't shocked when they asked us to sit at the bar and grab a drink.  The bartender was very friendly, and made a pretty good Mule. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I really like my mules served and a chilled metal container... The glass jug wasn't quite doing it for me. Especially since we sat outside it got warm quick. 

Once we set down at the table, the mediocre service really kicked in. It took almost 15 minutes to even get greeted, and then the server appeared to be in a rush the entire time.  

For dinner I ordered a Greek salad to start, a vegetarian pot pie pasty, and a broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake on the side.  No, of course I did not finish it all, but I wanted to have a little taste of a few things instead of just one pasty. Everything was very good. I was so excited to see that they serve quorn in their pasty's. It is my favorite vegetarian meat substitute, because it is not sit based.  Overall, despite the week service I definitely think will be back. It was a great selection, good portions and a really neat atmosphere. Great for groups."}
{"text":"So glad I found this! It looks like a little hole in the wall from the outside, but the inside is cozy! The food was absolutely amazing. The Ploughman's Plattet and the Chocolate Bread Pudding were fantastic! Plan to come here whenever I'm in Phoenix. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow! Tasty! Unexpectedly great pasties with all different fillings. Shared the Ruben and then the dessert peanut butter and jelly. Both fantastic. Nice atmosphere: modern rustic. Busy but attentive service. Sat at the kitchen bar and watched them make the pasties filling and pasties. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food below average service. Come for a bite don't stay for a poorly made cocktail by a rude staff"}
{"text":"Good variety of beers on tap.  Food - nothing to write home about.  Okay, but not great.  I was given the wrong salad dressing.  Waiting staff could not figure out who ordered what.  Really noisy due to \"industrial\" interior - open beam ceilings, conduits visible."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for ages. After watching a movie up the street at camelview a friend and I passed by and both immediately mentioned we should try it. A relaxed chill ambiance. Staff was friendly, sat ourselves and were greeted by our server a few minutes later. Colin, I believe, was his name. He gave recommendations and was quite attentive. Tried the peppered steak pasty as well as the oven chips. Portions are legit, if you're hungry you'll probably finish a full pasty but if not ravenous, leftovers for later! There's so much delicious on the menu that I will have to return. Their teas were refreshing and their pasties piping hot. Got a cinnamon caramel apple, a la mode, which was just perfect served with vanilla ice cream. A great dining experience for this quaint restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. Each time I loved what I got! Even have great beers and I am not a beer drinker! It is best at night when you are able to sit outside with candle lit tables. Very awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little dining spot on Mill avenue in downtown Tempe. I strolled by on my way to House of Tricks but I HAD to pop in for a meal due to the savory menu and the indoor/outdoor nifty dining. Large windows in the brick face of the building open out into the street, so you can sit outside but still at the bar, or take a highboy table for your drinks and meals.

Inside they have a combination of low tables, highboys, and bar seating. The diversity of their pastries is astounding, but if you don't happen to want a pastry that night, there are excellent salad options, too.

What drew me in was the casual, hip comfortable atmosphere and the awesome 80's and 90's music. The music created great energy. I had a portabello mushroom pastry which was fantastic and a glass of house merlot, which was fine and wallet friendly, serving to wash down the pastry.

The only down side is that there is not a bathroom in the restaurant. To use a bathroom, you need to get a key fob from a bartender, of which there is only one, and it is latched to a giant (like, 14' long) metal kitchen spoon. You have to go outside, around the corner, and go into a locked apartment building, and the public bathrooms are there. Weird. But a little charming, too.

Give this place a try - great energy, indoor/outdoor seating, tasty savory (and sweet!) pastries, and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"First time at Cornish Pasty. Arrived at 12:30 on a Monday and it was 1/4 - 1/3 full. It was open seating so I grabbed a piece of a bench that was full of folks who worked together. 

I ordered the Meat and Cheese Pasty, with the mustard cream sauce and a water, which came to $10.80 plus tip. It arrived in 10 minutes. My server was pleasant and efficient. 

The crust of the Pasty was buttery and flaky enough to remain light yet sturdy enough to avoid leakage. The filling, (meat, cheese, onions and gravy), had ample meat and cheese. The beef was cut into 1/2\" pieces, making it manageable. It was cooked in a hearty sauce but the mustard cream sauce put it over the top. BTW, there is no wrong way to eat one: pasties were one of the original hand-helds. 

For a filling, yummy, carb-loaded meal that sticks to your ribs, try The Cornish Pasty Co."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I was looking for something kinda different (trying to get the hubby to branch out) and I'm going to say this was an unexpected treat. We came while our was a bit slow which was fine by us. Service was good, and the pasties are fabulous. Flaky, and full of flavor. Looking forward to going back to try some others"}
{"text":"By far, hands down the best pastry I've EVER HAD!i got the All Day English Breakfast Pastry with melted cheese on top and the HP sauce.... **drool** I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a unique and delicious pastry!"}
{"text":"Not like anything else in Arizona. 

I've been to the Mesa and Tempe locations and this is probably the best atmosphere. Not to say the others suck, they're great. Even though this is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, where douches run amok, this is the location to visit. It's built into two houses. They have a giant bar that also stretches to its patio seating. 

The food is top notch. Can't go wrong with The Mexican or Cajun Chicken. What's even better is that they have vegetarian options for their traditional meat pasties. Really can't tell the difference between the two. 

Really enjoy the English spirit they have here. Also can't hurt that they have Strongbow."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great environment, went to the one in Scottsdale where it was a bit darker but overall great service and I loved it!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went to the scottdsdale branch and found the food to be very good.  We both had cottage pasties with ground beef and we also bought a half salad to share making 1/4 of the salad for each of us.  Everything was great.  The half salad was enough to make a meal for two without the pasties.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.
Enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Went here last night after attending the Jonathan Kellerman book signing at the Poisoned Pen (about 50 yards up the road). The place is pretty dimly lit on the inside. We were greeted immediately and advised that we could sit pretty much anywhere. Sat and got our menus; square metal sheets which were chipped and scratched up so much that it was very difficult to read the items. I scanned through the pasties but as soon as I saw \"lamb vindaloo\" I quit looking. Love lamb, love vindaloo. I ordered that along with a side of garlic mash. The kid had tandoori wings and the wife ordered the chicken pesto pasty.

Food took maybe 10-15 mins to come out. Mine was delicious. However, no sign of the garlic mash. I asked about it five mins later after determining that they'd likely forgotten about it and it's true, they had - not surprising, I suppose, considering that our order was taken down mentally (ie no pad and pencil - hint to the owners, no matter how good a server's memory is, orders on paper are mandatory for any restaurant). They apologized and asked if I still wanted to wait for it. I said yes. Finished my meal and had one or two of the wings, then out came the garlic mash. Also very tasty and covered in a layer of melted cheese.

All up a solid three stars, great tasting, good service, and they comped me the mash since it came out after I'd already finished my meal. The pasties could be a little larger for the price though. One thing I learned is that dipping carrot sticks in cheesy mash is actually pretty good! We'll come back for sure, I'm definitely wanting to try a few more of the pasties."}
{"text":"Love this place, unique food and ambiance is great for hanging out with friends. Chicken tikka masala pasty is the best!"}
{"text":"I've had about 4 different pastys and they've all been delicious. This is my go to place when I want something tasty and quick. There's always room to sit inside, but they also make telephone orders super easy to pick up. They're always quick to greet anyone walking in. They're really welcoming, I like that. I haven't been to the bar, but it's nicely lit and spacious. There's always a few people there which tells you the drinks must be good. My only complaint would be the parking, but given the location, I understand."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I love the dark, industrial ambience and the giant heavy menus. However, they were out of the pasty that I wanted (eggplant parm) and the food took forrrreeevverrr. The server was pleasant enough and she seemed like she meant well, but after she offered to refill our waters, she apparently forgot to actually follow through. Ultimately my second-choice Mexi Veggie pasty was delicious but all of the waiting left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The 3 stars really came from the service & drinks. We've been to the location in downtown Phoenix & we were blown away by our visit, this one, not so much. We had some of their $4 car bombs & bread. I had the chicken pot pie pasty which is always a favorite of mine, it came out & had an odd flavor we couldn't put our finger on, almost as if it wasn't very fresh. We were very underwhelmed with the actual food, we did love the outdoor seating which was perfect for sitting & having some drinks."}
{"text":"I want to preface this by saying that we LOVE Cornish Pasty, as a general rule. We usually go there every Sunday for a pasty and a beer and our favorite dessert, banoffee pie. We ordered take-out tonight which included our beloved banoffee pie, and when I removed it from the bag, I discovered a frozen-over mess of what was once, I'm sure, a lovely and intensely satisfying dessert. Normally the whole caramel-whipped cream-banana situation is perfectly fresh- ESPECIALLY the bananas, but this looked like it had been in the freezer for a week before they gave it to us. The bananas were brown and squishy and the whipped cream had turned yellow and was frozen solid throughout the middle. You guys should know better than to expect a dessert with those ingredients to be served any other way than fresh- you do everything else so well! I've never had it not fresh when I was in the restaurant- so this was a huge let down when I brought that rock-solid icy mass of bitter disappointment back for my hubby's birthday dessert! No frozen banoffee pie for anyone from now on, can I get an amen?!! And a replacement on my next visit, perhaps? (Kidding... Sort of.) Had to knock a star off an otherwise favorite local restaurant. If I had wanted a frozen dessert, I would have hit up Fry's for a Sara Lee's (which, sadly, would have been an upgrade from this).

UPDATE 2/28/15: You have been redeemed :) Thank you for taking care of us and serving up the usual delicious fare and the best, freshest banoffee pie we have had yet! It's back on top of our list of favorite desserts in town. See you next time :)

P.s. I wish we had taken a picture of the banoffee pie we got on our return visit because it not only tasted amazing, but looked equally amazing as well. We dove right in before we even thought to snap an updated photo for this review!

P.p.s. Crap, now I'm craving banoffee pie..."}
{"text":"This place is a must go when you are in the area! The Tempe bar is a great place to people watch. 

I had the chicken and pesto pasty and my husband had the bangers and mash pasty. We both enjoyed what we got. I like that there are 3 different sizes of drafts you can get. They had a very good selection of different drafts to get. One should definitely try them all. All the staff are friendly and are spot on."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  The Vegan Florentine Pasty combined the delicate flavor of fresh herbs and vegan cheese with the meatier textures of potatoes and other rich vegetables, and I was hooked.  Why else do I go?   The OVEN CHIPS.  They are delectable potato fries dipped and fried in fresh garlic or jalapeno as you please, and they are yummy.  

Other reasons:  The menu is startlingly huge, with pasties that capture flavors from around the world to satisfy many palates, from spicy Indian flavors to traditional American to Asian influences.  There are probably at least 40 pasties on the menu, so you're bound to find one you like, including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and a rotating menu of vegan pasties.

Finally, this is a British-style Pub, and so if you want to enjoy traditional British brews while people-watching on a wrap-around patio in Old Town Scottsdale, this is a great place for you. 

Final Notes:  Some of the tables are community-style, and so you may be seated at a long picnic table rubbing elbows with another jolly group of people (wasn't a problem for us).

Come hungry."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible service on Saturday afternoon. Took 40 minutes to get our food. Server was unapologetic. Had to flag her down several times for the check. The desserts are good but if you're in a rush or appreciate good service this isn't the place for you!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, and this location is great for outside seating.  Lots of vegetarian options (that are good) and the sauces are all delicious."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I love this place. Every pasty they have is just delish. I have been about 3 times to this location and it is just beautiful. Awesome casual/fun atmosphere and good food. What more could you ask for? 

I don't have a recommendation on which pasty to get. Actually... I recommend trying all of them. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Cool, relaxing atmosphere. We shared a bunch of different things and they were all really good. The deserts were fantastic too! I would give five stars but they were out of several things I wanted to try (and we went pretty early)."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food! Yes, it's a fancy hot pocket but the pastry is flaky and chewy and the pasty is enormous. I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken pasty. Loved the corn and cheese and the chicken was very moist. I am not a big fan of the vibe of this restaurant - the music is really loud and the space is quite small and narrow. However, if you're looking for a casual experience with a party of max 4 with some delicious pasties, this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The pizza sucked, my salad was burnt, and the drag show was nothing special. Worst mini-golf resort ever!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a regular at this point. At the beginning when the location first opened there were a couple of rough spots. Now however I feel the place is a great addition to the Old Town mix. Great bartenders good diverse crowd from 21 to 80 . This is what a real pub should be like. If you don't like the pasty choices try the pasta salad with chicken. So happy to see no TVs ."}
{"text":"Great place...can't wait for them to open one in downtown Phoenix!  There is ample outdoor seating, a great drink selection, friendly servers/bartenders and amazing food.  The Chicken Greek pasty was perfect - flavorful, fresh and so darn good!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today for the first time. I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Call it British comfort food. My belly was full and I felt great. All they needed was a few couches to go curl up for a nap. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice, and as a family, we have tried seven different pasties.  The pasties are delicious and substantial.  One pasty is more than enough food for an average person, and for some, it would even leave some leftovers for the following day.  The pasties deserve a 5 Star Rating.  I would highly recommend eating here, and if the pasty filling sounds appetizing to you, you will probably love it.

The only reason that I am holding back the final star is because the side dishes are truly awful.  We tried both soups, the potato leek soup was so salty it was inedible.  The underlying flavor profile was less-than-desirable as well.  Even if the cook had been less heavy-handed with the salt (it tasted like somebody was playing a practical joke because the amount of salt in the soup was ridiculous), it still wouldn't have been something I would order again.  

The walnut spinach soup was not salty, but it lacked one thing - flavor.  It reminded me of Gerber's bottled mush that we used to feed our poor unsuspecting babies before they were ready for solid food.  And finally, the cole slaw.  The cole slaw was some of the blandest, nondescript cole slaw that I have ever experienced.  The only flavor came from crunching on a hunk of onion that didn't really add flavor as much as it just put the nail in the coffin of my side order choices.

Bottom line - eat here; the pasties are wonderful.  But, don't eat any of the sides.  Mind you, I didn't try all of the sides.  But, based on my experience with three of them, I will never try another one again.  They clearly do pasties well, and that is how they have garnered the success necessary to expand to various locations in the valley.  For the side orders, in my opinion, they should start all over again and change their offerings entirely.  Or, just streamline the menu, ditch the sides altogether, and concentrate on what they do well, extremely well actually - pasties.

Order the pasties; you will LOVE them.  Order the sides at your own risk; remember, you have been warned."}
{"text":"A great, unique place that features healthier entrees and a fun environment. Wings available too, so don't despair. Great for get togethers and lighter bites."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If you don't know what a pasty is, it is traditionally a meat pie wrapped in a flaky crust.  Cornish Pasty expands this to vegetarian dishes, breakfast foods, desserts, etc...  Anything you can think of!  So, the food is great.  I loved the \"royale with cheese\" pasty.  The atmosphere is also very easy going and inviting.  This place achieves the feel of a popular and trendy pub without ever really trying.  Which is, of course, sublime and wonderful.  Other places force their \"coolness\" down your throat (Fox Restaurant Group for example).  This one KNOWS it is great and just wants you to come in and enjoy it too.  The staff is also very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waiter suggested some beers, let us sample a few and helped us to choose some great ones.  The \"Transatlantique Kriek Sour Ale beer\" was awesome.  This pub even has a pool table in the upstairs area.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a good variety of craft beers. For those that don't know, a pasty is basically a sandwich in calzone form.  Just try the food here, it's great."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Unlike anything I can describe. Our host, Autumn, sat down with us and explained the totally unique concept of the restaurant. I had the salmon pasty and my wife had the peppered stead pasty. Every dish comes with a dipping sauce and alot of work went in to developing this menu. I can't rave higher of the food or service. Six stars out of five. A must have while visiting Scottsdale or my new local go to place."}
{"text":"Bout time!

The \"salty soup\" issue seems to have been fixed - the Mushroom, Walnut, and Spinach soup is def worth your time. My girlfriend and I like to split it as an app before we order main course. 

Beer selection is still good - and servers are good about letting you sample a beer or swap out if you get the bottom of the keg...

Service on the patio can still be slow at times but I think overall it's a fresh selection / experience for Oldtown - glad I could throw up the extra stars!"}
{"text":"I got the Mexican this time. Omg yummmm. My friend got the meatball- it was he first time, she went simple. Delish! I love Cornish!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasties have been a personal favorite of mine since a visit to Bath, UK a few years ago. Usually, enjoyment of pasties is highly selective to the individual: however, Cornish Pasty Co. offers a massive selection of options friendly to anyone. The difficulty is: finding the right one for your taste. Here is a rundown of the ones I've tried: 

Bangers and Mash: Pros-hearty, heavy, gravy-filled meaty goodness. Cons- overloaded with \"mash\" (mashed potatoes). 

Chicken Tikka Masala: Pros- a great one to try for those tired of the meat-overload. Great spicy/mild flavor profile. Cons- sauce is a bit sweet, chunks fall out while eating.

The Royale with Cheese: Pros- my personal favorite pasty of all time. Meaty, cheesy, buttery, sweet, savory, EVERYTHING IN ONE. Make sure to get medium with bbq sauce. Cons- too much potato. Kept me asking, \"where's the beef?\"

Cajun Chicken: Pros- if you want meat, this one's the way to go. Overload of nothing but spice-rubbed ham, chicken, and bacon. Cons- not a ton of taste, a bit too much meat for my tastes (and that's hard to do). A bit of red/green pepper, broccoli, or other lighter veggie really would've helped.

For dessert, we went with sticky toffee pudding and B-something pie. Both tasty, nothing amazing. Good way to top off the meaty, buttery meal. The staff was terrific, portions were MASSIVE (), great ambience. Seemed to be aiming for a British pub/eatery style, making it really enjoyable for a hungry party! One of the greatest aspects of the place was the music they were playing! 70s-90s classic/alternative rock, with some modern too! Modest Mouse, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, Black Keys, you name it. Definitely heading over to the Vegas location, thanks for the fabulous, memorable, filling meal, Cornish Pasty Co.!"}
{"text":"Was turned on to this place by a work buddy. A treat no doubt. A true old school hangout.  Pool table and large bar. What else could a guy want."}
{"text":"This is a cool place.  They have a great outside seating area and lots of room to spread out and feel comfortable.  The menu is huge with a ton of selections and a variety of beer as well.  Their bloody mary's are great, a little spicy which I love but some people do not. Their greek salad and cream of tomato soup is fabulous! Just be warned...if you are going to have drinks and watch a game...they do not have ANY t.v.'s.  They want to encourage conversation and I think that's great! But, it's good to know before you go."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great food, fun environment and a huge variety, all at a great value. I ordered the Carne Adovada and my boyfriend ordered The Pilgrim, both were amazing. It's all open seating, lots of spots for big groups- I recommend sitting outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Cornish is a great place for a quick lunch or for a nice, casual dinner with friends in the evening. I've been several times, and the beer selection is always great. The servers are friendly and prompt, and the place has a casual, but slightly more upscale atmosphere. If it's a nice night, their deck is the perfect place to socialize and to try a new pasty! But wait - before you get to the pasty, you need to try those bacon-wrapped meatballs... they're amazing!!! Anyway - back to the pasty. I've tried 3 or 4 of them, and I've never found one I didn't like. The Mexican-style one is my current fave, but the pesto chicken one is great too. This is definitely a place to go hungry or to share - these things are big, and boy are they filling. If you've never had a pasty, it's sort of like a calzone, but with fillings that are more like a pot-pie or something similar. Very very good! The only thing to be aware of is that they prepare most of these before you order... so pick one that you don't have to change. (As in, they can't remove the onions from it for you or that kind of thing). But hey, if pasties aren't your game, their salads are great too! The Greek with chicken comes with an awesome green dressing... I have no idea what it is (some kind of vinaigrette?) but it's fantastic! I'd buy bottles of it if they sold it. All in all, a great place for a chill dinner and a cold beer - give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Super excited to have a pasty, but we decided to start with some soup... WOW! crazy good leak and potato soup as well as black bean, chicken, jalapeño style soup/chili.  AND THEN THE SURPRISE!  A few slices of bread and real butter that quite possibly came from the Bread Gods!  The freshest, most awesome tasting bread ever... has to use some real restraint for Pilgrim Pasty was yet to come... Thanksgiving stuffed in a Pasty with some gravy and cranberry's deliciousness!  

Christina our server brought some awesomeness to the meal and a great vibe of the Pasty Company!  Thanks for a great meal and great service."}
{"text":"If you never tried a pastie you need to go here! It is like the mix of a pot pie with a calzone! The options for fillings are endless! I am not much of a red meat eater so I went for the pesto chicken and it was delicious. My favorite part is that each pastie comes with its own sauce that pairs perfectly with the filling.

My sister went with the Shea parts pie and absolutely loved it! She said it made you feel like you were in your grandmas kitchen! 

We went for a happy hour on a Friday and we're able to sit outside! The outdoor patio has a lot of room for large parties so don't be afraid to bring all your friends! They had great deals on drinks! I usually go for the Moscow Mule! And they had a really good one! And it's served in the classic copper mug which is always a must for me! 

If you are looking for the perfect place to take the family for some tasty comfort food and great service this is the place to go! I hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"JILL!!!!!! Jill was our server tonight at Cornish and she was the coolest fricken chick ever!! We loved our time here. The food was amazing, as always, and Jill killing the customer service game!! Great time!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place, We live within a few blocks of here. The food is still really good! The service is awful, tonight we were there for dinner... only stayed for drinks our experience was so awful. The music was basically head bangers ball. When I asked the manager if possibly they could put on something less angry his reply \" umm didn't you notice the music isn't even on right now.\" So rude. He wouldn't even turn around and look at me. We will not be returning, such shame we probably ate there once or twice a month. There are too many places in Scottsdale where the servers and managers actually want your patronage.

I do want to update my review... the manager that was rude did reach out to me in a very professional email.  However I have to reiterate that your initial reaction was beyond rude and that type of music in a pub is not professional or enjoyable for the vast majority of people."}
{"text":"We loved the very large, tasty fillings, light pastry pasties here!  If we ever return to Scottsdale, we'll be back -- wish there was one here in Orange County, CA!"}
{"text":"We rushed in Cornish Pasty (pronounced PASS-tee, not pastr-y or paste-y) before their last call and they still happily served us without a stink face. 

+1 for that!

But the food was pretty unmemorable and makes me question why I sped from the Grand Canyon to Scottsdale to make it in Cornish Pasty for a midnight snack... I felt a little insane to say the least.

A Pasty reminds me of a larger, harder shell empanada with unique fillings..
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cornish-pasty-co-scottsdale?select=yarTeqHwg64O8odSZnxlfg#PDGAtDP0SGlc_mfxyxkHPw

Peppered Steak filling - It was good, but lacked steak and the dipping peppercorn brandy cream sauce was super salty. I know, it was gravy-esque and gravy is supposed to be salty. But I did not enjoy the sauce on the side, while I felt like it was more of a mushroom pastry than anything. Not peppered steak.

Chicken & Pesto filling - Pesto, chicken and cheese. It was A-OK with marinara sauce on the side.

We also got the Scotch Egg appetizer, which was not bad, but I wish there was more flavor in the batter of the egg. And I felt like egg was just an overcooked hardboiled egg.

You know that old stereotype about how bad British food is? Uhhh. ha ha ha.. uhh..."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is very good. We walked by on our way to another restaurant and stopped to check out the menu. We've never had pasties before, and we didn't know what we were missing! I had the mushroom and my  boyfriend had the lamb and mint. I can rarely finish a whole plate of food and I nearly did it, it was delicious.  The service was super fast and friendly too. The best part, they were about $10 each. You cannot beat that in Old Town Scottsdale. 
They also allow dogs on the patio so there were a bunch of cuties lounging around while we ate. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great laid back and friendly atmosphere. The servers are very attentive and the food is amazing! They have a great selection of beer and wine. They play good music. We got the portobello mushroom and the greek, chicken pesto and the pilgrim and they are all amazing. You cant skip dessert especially the chocolate bread and butter pudding and sticky toffee pudding, they're heavenly."}
{"text":"Dog friendly, environment was welcoming and great. 
Pesto chicken pastie, spicy Asiago pastie, broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake, and oven chips were so delicious. 
Never gone to a restaurant where everything was great, including service. 

Deff recommend going!"}
{"text":"The menu was extensive. Decided on the Pepper Steak only to be informed that they were out. Had the Guinness instead. A hearty choice. Our party of 4 all enjoyed lunch. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Have never seen such a choice if Cornish pasties. Loved the lamb and mint. The chicken tikka Marsala was tasty too! Then my friends ploughmans was served and that made my mouth water!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the food is always great and the beer selection isn't too bad either. Every time my husband and I come here, we try to order something new and I've never had a bad pasty. My favorites are the chicken Greek and pesto chicken- you can't go wrong! As previously mentioned, it's great for dogs on the patio and an overall cool spot in Oldtown."}
{"text":"We have had a great experience at this establishment in the past but unfortunately our recent experience left us with no desire to return.  The service was extremely poor and the waiter seemed uninterested in being there.  We ordered an appetizer and then decided upon a second and told it was too late.  We would have to get the second appetizer with our main course.  Keep in mind that the appetizer was a cheese and bread board that did not need to be cooked.  We were told we could not take an ingredient out of an item, never been told that before, and three times that daughter gave her order  the response was \"we are out of that.\"  It was a very long wait for our food and when it came out they forgot to prepare one of the meals.  One of our guests said it was a place he would not return and unfortunately I feel the same.  There are many great restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"You know all the jokes about bad British food?

The Cornish Pasty is a place that does pasties, which are basically dough pockets filled with various savory fillings. Apparently British miners found these to be ideal vehicles for meals, and they got popular. This place specializes in them, albeit for a price much higher than what a miner could afford. 

The location itself is okay. There is bench seating at large, often shared tables. There was no obvious place to enter, lending to confusion early on. I felt like I had to hunt down a waitress. 

The food was boring. The pasty I had - bangers and mash - was piping hot but about as exciting as cafeteria food. The execution was unquestionably good, but I felt like I was simply wading through a sea of okay chopped meat and boring mashed potatoes. The seasoning could have been improved a lot.  Those eating with me had marginally burned pasties, though their filling was slightly better. 

Don't get me wrong - this place isn't bad. It just certainly wasn't for me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great atmosphere, delicious foood, friendly staff.  This place is AUTHENTIC!!  I had the Reuben Pasty and tomato soup. Two words, \"the bomb!!!!\""}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great environment and such a fun new style of food all the pastys are delicious! Make sure you get an English beer too!"}
{"text":"Ate here in December - had a great visit.  a group of 6 - everyone ordered different meals but everyone seamed please.  Mine was a little over cooked - dried out a bit - but not so bad I wanted to complain.  Nobody else mentioned any issues.  We shared a Bannoffe desert.  FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my face locales in the area. I'm a business owner who loves to escape to a relaxing, but chill environment, with even better food. This one fits the bill. Even my gluten free, dairy free lifestyle can still be accomodated here. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It would not be an exaggeration to say that the opening of this Cornish Pasty location has changed my life. I have always been a Cornish Pasty Co. fan for the sheer fact that the food is delicious, satisfying, and extremely reasonably priced. This location has enhanced my Cornish Pasty experience even more, if that's possible. 

In all the times I've been here (out of more than 10), I've only had to wait for seating once. The entire space is wide open and seats many more people than the other locations. I've always had good experience with the service- everyone is laid back and genuinely seems to like working there. 

Every time I have a visitor from out of town, I bring them or recommend the Cornish Pasty Co. and I have yet to hear negative feedback.

Parking can get a little finicky but I haven't had to worry about it for the most part. I've had luck with a little lot behind the building and if one of the businesses is using that for valet, there is usually decent street parking."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Love sitting on the patio. :-) This is my first time here and from now on I'm going to try each pasty...just go down the list."}
{"text":"What in the world is a Pasty, you ask? It's the love child of a calzone and a pie crust. A gourmet hot pocket and a danish. Truly, it's just pretty freaking delicious.

My company had an event here and we sat on the patio. The sky was drizzling, so the staff pulled down the curtains to keep us from getting wet during our meal. The menu is plain unfair because every-single-pasty looks really good. Be prepared to change your mind at the last minute. I asked the waiter what he thought of the Pilgrim (I cheated and looked at Yelp reviews first). He said it was in his top 5, so I acquiesced. 

Let me give you the specs on this thing - Roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing. Served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. It's basically everything you love about Thanksgiving dinner cooked into a pie.

The pasties come out cut into two parts and I could not stop after the first. It was just too good to not keep going. I think it was the flaky and delicious crust. I really don't know how there could be a bad choice on the menu. We ordered a plethora of desserts as well, which all received rave reviews from the ladies in my office.

I look forward to coming back to check out the expansive bar area and try out another pasty. And, as a Cornish descendant, I highly recommend you support this local Pasty Company!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great spot with delicious food, reasonable prices and laid back feel, this is it. Cornish pasty is my go-to spot to take out of towners and it's always a hit. You can't go wrong with any their \"adult hot pockets\". Huge portions, lots of options (even for veggie/vegan friends) and they don't skimp on anything. I often end up taking the other half home with me. As far as drinks go, they have a great beer and cocktail list. Try the \"not your fathers root beer\". It is quite yummy."}
{"text":"Always great service, food tastes amazing, awesome outside atmosphere. I have only been to their Scottsdale location, but have become a regular. Great prices as well! Make sure to check it out on Wed evenings for their wine specials!"}
{"text":"The other night we tried this place so came back days later because we thought the food was good.  Tonight they were out of everything we ordered.  Found out that the food is pre-prepared which is ok if it comes out hot and is actually available.  Our food came out all at different times so we didn't enjoy a dinner \"together.\"  

The last time we were here Daniel, our server, told us one of the desserts was vegan, well tonight I asked to have it without the dairy on top and I was told they used butter and it actually wasn't vegan.  I told her what the other server told me and she (Ashley) came up with a lie, \"oh, last week we had vegan peanut butter and jelly.\"  Wow! No allergies here, but haven't eaten dairy in over two years and was lied to about what ingredients are used.  On top of all that, we got there at 6:40pm and didn't get to eat until 7:50pm! Not too good, especially if it's pre-made anyway.  I would recommend going during slow times and not if you have diet restriction because not only is it limited but they apparently either don't know the ingredients and food items or just give false information that could be deadly to some guests.  Overall review, pass this place up or experience for yourself..."}
{"text":"Very casual restaurant with mostly long communal benches to sit at. This isn't your usual restaurant I never seen a sausage salad on anybody's menu before. This restaurant specializes serving the Cornish Pasty. They offer a multitude of varieties and a long list of vegetarian ones to choose from.

 I ordered the traditional \"Oggie\" pasty. It was a thin crispy crust stuffed with nicely seasoned moist beef, potatoes, onions and rutabagas. It was delicious as it was but when you hit it with the wine gravy then it becomes super delicious!

As delicious as my pasty was I'm glad I stopped eating at half. When I got up I felt full. My waiter was very helpful and efficient and offered me extra sauce to take home with the yummy half I brought home. I don't think it's possible to leave hungry from here.

The parking lot is very small and you might not get a spot. You can easily park across the street by the shops.

A very solid 4 stars..."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best food ever. I had the bangers and mash and the shepherd's pie pasties. So, so good. The crunchy crust is perfect with the savory insides. I was watching the cook and he looked like he was loving it. Like each piece was art.

I also had the long wongs wings. They are perfect. I got the hot ones. Was tempted to try insane, but glad I chose hot. Made my nose run and sweat to bead on my forehead. They were perfectly crunchy and delicious. I'm actually kind of jealous.

Everything seemed to be cooked from scratch as well. The freshness was awesome. I will never see food like this in Seattle :("}
{"text":"For a place that only serves one kind of food, they have a surprising Humber if different delicious things to eat!

The beers are all very good and the deserts are just incredible."}
{"text":"The service was relaxed, chilled and friendly. The server was knowledgeable on not only the food but the tap selections. 
We ordered a large Greek salad and a cottage pie pastry to share. Salad was fresh and crunchy, dressing was home made and delicious! 
Cottage pie pastry was yummy! I could tell the pasty part of the pie was made in house- wonderful! 
I'm from South African originally and in my neck of the world these are called pies! These pies were unique and tasty! Will definitely recommend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Cornish padtrybhas expected over the years to a few different restaurants, but regardless of which place you go to, they offer the same quality food and the same kind of beer on tap. 
All is good and I will continue coming here from time to time."}
{"text":"Jillian was a great waitress and had gd suggestions for us. If you like chicken pot pie, then you'll love this place-not only can you get a chicken pot pie pasty, you can get a wide variety of other combinations-there's something here for everyone. If we lived in the area, we would come back to try others-it was hard to just pick one each! Pasties are yummy!!"}
{"text":"So tonight was my first time at Cornish Pasty Co. And I have to say, I was not impressed. Walking in, the smell of flaky crust and fresh baked Pasty's entices you, but for me - the flavor fell flat.

I ordered the Asiago Chicken Pasty. The inside was lined with hablano pepper, chicken, black beans and cheese. I'm not sure what type of seasoning was used, but no flavor really stuck out. Almost Like the chicken and pepper were boiled in a pot and thrown in. The spice of the pepper was not too powerful, but it was the most prominent flavor - or sensation I guess.

The crust was done well, but it wasn't as flaky as I personally would've liked. I don't know if I would try this place again. The waitress didn't really seem to want to be there - which is fine, but At least try and hide it lol"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended. We were finally in the area with some time to check it out. 

First, i love the atmosphere.  It's very casual but intimate.

Second, the service was top notch. 

The food....well, it was one of the most unique and delicious meals i've had in a while.

We started with the Scottish eggs and it was very good. The sausage was crispy on the outside and every bite was a great texture.

We had the meat and cheese pasty, bangers and mash, chicken Alfredo and pesto chicken. The first three were just amazing. Wonderful flavor and texture. The meat was all just perfect. The pasty was cooked to perfection. None of us cared for the pesto chicken though. 

We finished off with some toffee pudding which is a MUST in my opinion. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Cornish is one of the best spots in AZ. I am partial to the Tempe location, but I enjoyed my experience at the Scottsdale branch as well. 

The food is the same (DELICIOUS) and the Scottsdale location is a bit more family-friendly.

Literally everything on the menu is a home-run. The pasties are perfect, the soup is a favorite, and the wings are YUM.

The patio area is fantastic and you can snag a 32 oz. beer to take in the AZ sun. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Comfort food at its finest!!!! What is a pasty? Basically a hearty calzone with sweet or savory filling.  A rich history follows this filling and tasty treat. I had no idea what to expect, and what I discovered was incredible!!! The restaurant is trendy & service great! Open kitchen concept for diners to take a peek of how a pasty is made."}
{"text":"LOVED this place (Mesa location).  Our waitress was quick as a whip with attention, drinks and food.  My dad ordered a bowl if the leek, potato and Stilton soup.  I had one bite and took the bowl from him.  The soft soda bread made the perfect tool for cleaning the bowl of every delicious drop.  And then came the pasties.  Oh mama.  I didn't want to like them- a meal in a pocket and all.  But my Greek pasty made it's way happily down with a Kronenbourg or two.  And then the show had an epic twist- dessert.  No- not me- I couldn't possibly eat another bite, I said.  But dad ordered the chocolate bread and butter pudding anyway.  Sweet Lord- deliver me!  Crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside with rich chocolate flavor that WASN't too sweet.  I had more than 1 bite.  Ok- I had more than half of it.  And now, more than 24 hours later,  I have no regrets.  Go eat there now."}
{"text":"Just are here and loved it!!

It is in Old town and on Goldwater. When you pull up it is very inviting. Great open deck area and the bar area windows open up to the outside. 

When we sat down we felt comfortable. The building is English style. Beautiful inside. 

The drink menu has a large selection of wines and beers. The beers are 20oz for less than $5! Great prices. 

To eat we got pastys of course. I got the one that has a burger in it. This one was great! Very flavorful. And the dipping sauce they send out helps the pasty be less dry. So it's i just perfect. My bf got the oggie or the original one. He liked his as well but he liked mine better. I think because it was cheesier!!  We also got the home chips with garlic on them. Excellent. 

For dessert we got the apple caramel pasty. With the ice cream it was the absolute perfect ending to the meal. 

This is the perfect place for if you are up for some good comfort food and want to fill up. Very unique. Nothing else like it around Scottsdale. 

A solid 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Of the most unique places to eat! On our travels to England I was lucky enough to try the pasties and was fascinated by the culinary experience! I mean who wouldn't live to eat their favorite meal wrapped in phyllo dough!! C'mon!!! Out of this world experience ya gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"Perfect dinner. Perfect waitress. Great selection! Had cottage pie, and tika masala - spicy!! Great outdoor seating. 
Will come back!"}
{"text":"A local Phx hit. I've tried my best to order something different each time. Everything is great, it's a win win and happy hour prices and selection is legit. 

Lastly, don't you ever say that these are \"fancy hot pockets.\" It is literally insane to compare the two and you're nuts if you do, Gavin."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I missed this little gem for so long! Thank goodness a co-worker invited several of us to join him at his favorite place! I see why...charming cozy atmosphere that has a funky vibe. The service was friendly and eager to suggest goodies! Lots of selections for wine & beer, with specials for Happy Hour! We shared several things! The fries with garlic were amazing but if you don't love garlic steer clear!! The pasties we had were varied; bangers & mash, meatball and the oggie were all delicious! Great flavors and the dips & gravy that accompanied them highlighting the flavor even more!! We hung out on the patio which was perfect! I will definitely be back with my fiancé!! Thanks for the lovely evening!! I enjoyed watching the process of making them as well!"}
{"text":"Finally a Cornish pasty co. That can actually fit people! This new spot is awesome, it has a really nice outside deck area and a huge bar you can sit at.

For all you newcomers, the good seems simple but it's amazingggg and the drinks are good and cheap. 


Three tips: 

-Irish car bombs (better than usual)
-mushroom walnut soup (literally the best soup in the world, even though we are in Arizona)
-pepper steak pasty is really good"}
{"text":"I have to agree with John B and Gayl B who wrote favorable reviews of Cornish Pasty.  I'm no expert on the authenticity of the food but I can vouch for its deliciousness.  

I ordered a lamb with mint pasty, despite the fact that I'm more of a lamb with rosemary, garlic and lemon kind of guy.  The crust was flaky, crunchy and delicious.  To my surprise, the filling was large chunks of slow cooked meat with root vegetables.  I half expected ground lamb and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of ingredients.  

This place has a nice atmosphere, a large beverage selection and lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  It's the kind of place where you could spend a few hours, enjoy an inexpensive, but quality meal and toss back a pint or 3.  Just have Uber take you home."}
{"text":"Cool vibes. This place is small. But it's really cool and its on the corner so if you sit outside you have a great view. 

Compared to the other locations, I'd say this one is the smallest. There is only one large table inside of you have 5+ ppl. I'd say 6 comfortably. 

Service was speedy. It's a small place so it's hard for them to forget about you. The draft beers are great and the Pasty was phenomenal. Ordered the Pilgrim with a 14OZ Kilt-lifter. My girlfriend ordered the meatball Pasty with a glass of Orange Blossom. A local brew. Overall great experience. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"There are two locations I know of and this one is well placed in Downtown Scottsdale. I prefer the original location in Tempe for it's charm, but you can't beat the convenience for either.

Love the food here-simple and delicious.  If you aren't familiar with a Pasty, it's similar to a calzone but the bread is more like a pie crust (think \"hot pockets\" if they had more filling options and they were homemade by Grandma). The prices are fair, a pasty and a drink will run you about $12-$15. One pasty is more than enough for a full meal - I always leave the restaurant with half of mine to take home and it makes a fine reheated lunch.  I wish they had few more non-alcoholic and signature cocktail drink options, but that isn't a huge deal.  There is a full bar, so you can probably request a tailor made drink.  I am not that creative with drink ordering, so I like to see ideas right there on the menu.

Service and quick seating has never been an issue.  Parking is limited though."}
{"text":"This delightful restaurant opened up a few blocks from my home and my friends and I have have fallen in love! The pasty's are delicious. The soup is to die for (and the fresh baked  bread), the Scottish eggs are so very very yummy!

But what we really love -- is the Beer Selection!!! 
Boddingtons on tap! Strongbow, Kronenbourg, Flemish Ale

We love the Pasty because the music is always perfectly loud, we never have to yell to talk to each other - conversation is actually aspired to in this great establishment! 

The staff is engaging and friendly and make you feel at home, instead of a dollar sign. Katie is our favorite bartender and we also just love Phil. 

The ambiance is just delightful! The colors are warm and inviting, the tables are large and roomy and invite you to meet your neighbors! We love sitting at the outside bar, with beautiful stools and plenty of space!

This is my favorite place to grab a bite and hang out in our neighborhood (Oldtown)!
Everyone who comes to town also gets the pleasure of going with me here as well. This is my go-to for every guest and my friends and I to hang!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in old town. They have a unique menu but still find a way to make everyone happy. The most difficult part is finding the best thing on the menu because there is a wide range of choices. My favorite is the Mexican pasty (despite the fact it's probably the furthest item from 'authentic'). But it's hard to argue with the flavor. I really enjoy the setting they have, it's not too loud and makes for a great date spot."}
{"text":"Wow!!  This place has impressively yummy food with a beautiful modern atmosphere and great service.

This is the sort of place that makes its vegetarian food taste so good that it doesn't need to be super heavy to compensate for missing meat.  If you're sad that you haven't eaten shephard's pie since you gave up meat, mosey on over!   The vegetarian cottage pie is generous, hearty and flavorful - makes you forget you're not eating meat!

We've tried the lovely bit o'salmon and three different vegetarian pasties.  The pasty shell itself is really nice - flaky and yummy but not in a heavy, thunk in the stomach sort of way.  Each pasty choice has been burtsing with flavor.  The salmon is light and flavorful and the combination with the aparagus is just lovely - and the dill cream sauce has a wonderful light tang.  The portobella mushroom has beautiful vegetables and melty cheese, perfect with marinara.  The vegetarian chicken and rosemary is not too dry, and spiced well with nice texture but then the mustard cream sauce hits it out of the park.   

The place itself is lovely.  There are tons of seating choices - inside and out, wrap-around bar, big and small tables - it's large but interesting.  The decor is rich and dark with lots of refrences to mining (read all about the origins of the pasty on the menu), and the service is attentive and informed.  

After multiple excellent visits, this place is definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The only reason I would even give it two stars is because the food is delicious. However, the service was TERRIBLE. I'm in the service industry, so normally I give people a break. But this was absolutely uncalled for. Our bartender, a middle aged woman who looked as if she hated life never came to even check up on us after we got or food, she spent most of her time talking to her friends who were at the bar. Absolutely NO personality. And made us feel as if we weren't welcome. I would honestly, never dine in here again because the experience is terrible. Take out only please."}
{"text":"This place is so cute ! They have a HUGE beer menu ! We ordered a rueben and pilgrim pasty. Both were good and super filling. Would recommend others to come here !"}
{"text":"Food is good. Atmosphere is nice.  Bartenders don't tend to the bar at all. Kept having to ask bussers for drinks.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"Super delcious. I stopped to have this THREE times while in Arizona. Two out of three of the locations had wonderful service but the one located outside of downtown Tempe just didn't get the service right."}
{"text":"I had never been to Cornish Pasty!  Any location!  Crazy, right?

Oddly, we couldn't decide where to go to dinner, yet I ordered the chicken tikka masala pasty and he the lamb vindaloo, so it seems to me, all the pre-dinner discussion was quite ridiculous.  Both were so yummy!  Pastry was flaky, fillings were excellent and with the amount of heat you would expect from both dishes in an Indian restaurant.  I also loved that all of their pasties can be purchased partly baked to finish in the oven at home!  So technically, you could serve them to your friends and pretend you made them yourself!  And if you're a beer drinker, the list is long.  I had an elderberry cider which was delicious, but not so good with the tikka masala.  I should have planned ahead before ordering.

There is a ton of seating, although a fair amount of the indoor seating is long tables with bench seating for large parties or communal dining.  Not so much a fan of that, but then again, I'm probably somewhat anti-social.  We went on a Sunday evening, fairly early, and there was plenty of available seating, however.

We look forward to trying many, many more of those pasties!"}
{"text":"Working in a restaurant, I am generally very understanding of poor service. But at this moment I find myself in the in n out drive through because after all of my friends finished their pastys our server decided to just cancel my order without asking me because it was taking too long. Then she proceeded to drop the check for my one beer which after some reasoning about our situation they decided I probably shouldn't need to pay for that. The story ends with one friend having her debit card get lost and me not receiving any food. Can't wait for my in n out though! That place never disappoints. I waited for over a year and was very excited to go to Cornish but at the end of the day, I can now say I wasn't missing out on anything. Haven't tried a pasty and never will. So I can't speak for their food. Oh well."}
{"text":"Incredible place and outstanding pasties. My family is from Cornwall and these are the best pasties I've had in the US."}
{"text":"They have a HUGE selection of pasties (pronounced with a soft a, like apple) and a few soups and some English sides like Scotch eggs!  I first went here before quitting meat and dairy, so I've had a couple of the chicken pasties (BBQ is most memorable), and most recently had one of their vegan selections.  The vegan pasty was filled with greek fare like tomatoes, olives, spinach and was delicious.  My only complaint is that they are all made ahead of time, so there's no opportunity to order a pasty from the menu, plus or minus an item.  But c'est la vie.  It allows them to get food out onto the table in a very expeditious manner.  I've had happy here and the drinks are good, with a great beer selection.  If you're an omnivore, vegetarian, or vegan, you will find something to eat here... and unless your appetite is a hearty one, you will have leftovers!  
Note: Parking is tough and is mainly on the surrounding streets.  Sometimes easiest to park on the other side of Goldwater and walk across."}
{"text":"This has a great location and the food is great. If you haven't had a pasty yet you must try it! Service was good at the bar (As a bachelor it's where I normally sit). I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food tastes good and prices are really reasanble. My only complain is the service which is not very fast."}
{"text":"I have yet to enjoy this locations tasty pasty's (but I have had their pasty's at their original location), but this review is specifically for their drinks and patio. Recently, we enjoy drinks on their beautiful patio. With the weather being perfect, there's nothing better than sitting on a patio like Cornish Pasty and enjoying a cold drink and snack. The patio wraps around two historical homes with pretty trees hanging over the tables. They have large tables to fit big groups and plenty of seating at the bar. I was impressed with their extensive beer selection and particularly enjoyed the banana beer, yes banana beer! I will write more once I have the chance to enjoy a pasty here, but so far, I am nothing but excited and happy with this great new addition to Old Town!"}
{"text":"What a fun get away!  Jenna is the best server ever!  Can't wait to get back"}
{"text":"Perfect meat pies from traditional to inventive, just can't go wrong here.  Did you want a beer to wash it down?  So many good choices!"}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect as typically British food sucks.  Boy was I surprised! The Oggie was pretty darn tasty, the staff friendly, and the decor was really cool."}
{"text":"100th review WOOHOO! This is a great new addition to old town! I came here with friends for a  few drinks and some food! First off, their patio is AMAZING! It will be perfect in the spring! I had a HUGE 32 oz beer ( I cabbed it out- don't worry) and loved it!  I also tried the \"Oggie\" the orginial pasty! It was AMAZING. I had never had a pasty before and am so glad I tried it! I am a fan and actually scheduled a happy hour there this week! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Everything we had was excellent!! If I had to make a single selection per dining category I would say:

Appetizer: Meatballs, they should be called Amazeballs

Pasty: The Oggie. This is a family tradition for us so I am partial. The red wine gravy is incredible!

Dessert: The chocolate bread pudding. I am not a sweets person but could easily SLAM this whole thing."}
{"text":"RE: Cornish pasty company in tempe. 

the atmosphere at their new location is quite different. it's in a bungalow house, with huge amounts of outdoor seating...on a porch....next to the street. it's like being at home and eating outside watching the neighbors walk by! very cool location. 

service was great, food was just as fantastic as their tempe location. it's brighter and more well-lit....i think more to fit the scottsdale crowd, but the food alone is superb enough for all peoples of planet earth. 

i had the vegetarian chicken asagio this time. it came with a side of salsa and sour cream to calm the heat from all the chiles. as usual, it was packed with savory goodness.

well, thank goodness one of the tastiest and budget friendly dining options is just down the road from us now."}
{"text":"I got the corn beef & cabbage special for St. Patrick's Day and it was enjoyable, but it could've been great. There wasn't very large portion of corn beef stuffed in it and it was cubed instead of shredded. Horseradish sauce was available, but they didn't offer it and I didn't think to ask until it was almost gone. 

I mean, hey it's not a regular menu item and this was my first time in the place. I'm not gonna cry, I did clean the plate and it was getting busy. The Guinness & Jameson was cold & wet as expected and did the job.

I got there early and avoided all the riff-raff. I'll be back to try out a few other items and I wouldn't be surprised if they earn another star. The actual restaurant/bar is pretty dope, nice atmosphere, plenty of seating with nice folks."}
{"text":"Best hot pocket I've ever had. 5 stars Venue was nice and the staff was very friendly. Lots to choose and anyone should be able to find something they like. 

I got the BBQ chicken and it was nice and spicy. I tried the pizza port IPA which was a nice treat because I've never had it before."}
{"text":"There are few things I love more than foreign cuisines being adapted to new markets, and Arizona's Cornish Pasty Co. is an absolute brilliant rendition of a classic British dish extrapolated into the budding US Brewpub scene. The food, booze, and experience are all brilliant, and I'll go as far as to say that this is my favorite spot in the state. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Yes, it can get crowded at CPC, but such is the curse of a popular spot. There's ample seating both indoors and out, and I'm a big fan of the communal long tables that are growing increasingly popular. While not necessarily fast, service isn't notably slow, and the staff are generally friendly and knowledgeable. Honestly what more could you ask for? This is a great spot regardless of the size of your party or your type of outing. Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

It's rare that I ever stray away from basing my reviews purely on the dishes that I personally order, but I need to take a quick minute just to note that CPC has a truly fantastic selections of brews on tap, and they price those brews at times more competitively than the liquor store. Brilliant. As for the food, a sizable pasty (3x or more times larger that what you'll find across the pond) will run you under $10, which is more than reasonable. They're filling, so absolutely no need to get more than one. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Excellent. While the expansive menu that combines traditional favorites with contemporary gems might have you wishing you could try them all, I went with a classic meat and cheese and couldn't have been more pleased. It'd be easy for CPC to pack their pasties with mediocre ingredients (such can be the nature of the dish), but the meats and cheeses here were excellent and brought together by fantastically buttery and flaky crust. To top it all off, the gravy proved an excellent addition, and the whole thing combo'd brilliantly with a hefty 32 oz. beer. 

This was a marvelous dish, and I'll strongly argue that it's better than anything I've had in England. Dual Stars Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

Absolutely. With the variety, accommodation, reasonable prices and quality food, Cornish Pasty Co. is my favorite spot in the valley. This is as good as it gets. Star Granted."}
{"text":"To clarify, the pronunciation is \"Paa-stee\". Not \"Pasty\" like the word \"Pastry\", and not \"Pasty\" like the word \"Pasta\". That said, the location on Goldwater is always consistent, delicious, and affordable.

FOOD: Low price for the great quality you get, and typically one pasty is enough to fill you up, but if you're really hungry get a side or appetizer and you should be good. I've been here probably six times now, always satisfied with what I get and it's always freshly made, out of the oven, piping hot.

SERVER: Most of the time, it's a little slow and lack of attentiveness / refills, but the last time I went it was better than the times before. Still, on average, it lacks a tad bit in this area.

HOSTING: I go here a lot for lunch and it's always pick where you wanna sit or wait for a split second while we pick you a spot. I've been here on a Friday night also and I don't recall there being a long wait or hosts with attitude.

AMBIANCE: Pub-like English tavern feel. Fits with the food and casual yet unique for Arizona, I feel.

Go here and try any of their signature pasties!"}
{"text":"Great pasties my favorite is the chicken tikka marsala. I really enjoy the bar keeps and the beer selection on tap. Great traditional British pub."}
{"text":"Still waiting to eat here, but I've had drinks here a few times and it's always good! :) I love the outdoor seating options, especially when it's nice outside, and would definitely recommend the Scottsdale location over the one in Tempe - it's definitely a lot nicer. Yesterday I had their cocktail of the month for May, the Princess Leia, and it was delicious! Pineappley with little kiwi seeds and a really good flavor. I definitely wish they had this one all the time lol."}
{"text":"We always make our way to the Cornish Pasty Co. every time we go to AZ. Their buttery crust stuffed with all sorts of different meals in themselves are to die for. My favorite is the tikka chicken pasty. It really hits all the flavor profiles of Indian food, all in one bite. Wash it down with a large mug of beer and you've got the perfect comfort meal. Everything about CPC is unique. I wish they had one in SoCal."}
{"text":"There are so many things to love about this place.  The location is cool being in Old Town and it's very attractive both in the patio area and inside the restaurant.  They have attractive, rustic seating and a cool vibe to the place.  Our waitress couldn't have been more pleasant or helpful.

The food is simply amazing.  We loved the pastry doe that wrapped the meal.  It really isn't a sandwich place.  It reminded our group of a pot pie.  Truly the ingredients and flavors were magnificent.  This is a restaurant Scottsdale can be proud of."}
{"text":"Quaint ambience with old houses turned into a haven of beer and British pasties. Great patio and zero TV's which means people actually talk to each other."}
{"text":"We had not been in a while and Really love the place, but we did not have a great experience Sunday.  We sat at the bar, the restaurant was not busy, nor the bar.  
They had one bartender on that was very slow and seemed scattered.  Several dirty dishes on the bar and empty glasses with guests looking helpless.   We would have ordered two more rounds if we were offered.  Aside from that, we weren't even greeted properly, just dropped two waters off, no menu, then three mins later after asking beer menus, wait, we also need food menus.  Then, he rambled off a List of things they were out of.....Quite a  lot actually.  The food was good, but not great.  We weren't asked at all btw.  Also it took a long time.  Overall a real disappointing visit."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie pasty here is delicious. The filling wasn't too salty, the crust had the right about of flake and crunch, and the chicken & veggies were tender. It was the definition of comfort food in a conveniently sized, handheld package.

It also comes with additional chicken pot pie filling sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"Bad service... more than enough staff snd low traffic. Lazy staff!!! There where empty seats all around ... Should bd ashamed!!"}
{"text":"I'm never ever disappointed by meal here. Every kind of pie you can imagine. Tons of veggie options, which i love. Pies are alwyas perfectly cooked and served piping hot. Do yourself a favor and order a garlic mashed potatoes for the table. Fun relaxed atmosphere too. A must visit every time we're in town."}
{"text":"Have to admit, I was having a very bad day when me and my boyfriend came here for dinner. Two blown out tires and one very expensive tow truck bill had my feathers ruffled. We came here for dinner at the tow truck driver's recommendation that we MUST order the Cajun Chicken Pastry. We sat on the side patio and were not acknowledged so we relocated to the center communal table in the courtyard entry way. A few minutes later a man with a beard came over and asked me if I had been helped yet to which I answered in a very pissy way \"no\". Although I don't believe this man was a server, he rose to the occasion and got us water and coffee and introduced us to our server and made sure we were taken care of. It made my day better and the coffee and food was delicious. I'm glad we came here, definitely in need of the comfort food they serve."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The service is quite good as well and we didn't have any trouble getting a great table overlooking downtown Scottsdale. They don't have a kids' menu but there are some options that the kids can eat with no problems."}
{"text":"I visited Arizona and happened to be in the area so I stopped by and checked out this place. 
First of all when I came inside, my first impression was: this place is very spacious and very dark! They have pool tables and I think more than one bar.

I ordered The Oggie (The Traditional Pasty): steak, potato, onion & rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup, which was recommended by the server. The taste is not bad, the crust is crispy (I think this is the secret) but I think it really lacked of meat.
I also ordered a glass of Saved Red Blend red wine during happy hour, which I think the server forgot to deduct $1 from the price.

No offense, but in my honest opinion, I think my mom makes more delicious pasties than Cornish's!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, impeccable food and the service by Sarah was phenomenal. Favorites include banger and mash, Cajun chicken, and the bread pudding. But come here for the service, as they catered to our every need and Sarah gave great advice for drinks and catered to our every need."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My girlfriend studied abroad in London and couldn't wait to try the Shepard's Pie. It is spot on. The outrageous amount of Pasty selections makes it a great choice for everyone. My friend finished his in minutes and even ordered one to go! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the valley! Great atmosphere. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I like this location better than the Mesa one. It seems more inviting and well lit. I sat outside in the patio and it was pretty great. Happy hour was on and it was a perfect night with beer and a pasty talking with friends.

There's a good variety of pasties and alcohol. As for the pasties, you probably won't find this food at most restaurants here in the valley.

I also like that this place is on Goldwater so it's not all caught up in the crowd of main street Old Town. :)"}
{"text":"LOVE the tomato soup. I normally only eat tomato soup with my grilled cheese, but their tomato soup is a must have whenever I go in. I get their traditional pasty, the cottage pie. I prefer it over the Shepard's pie because the minted meat is a little too minty for me. But I could probably eat any of their pasties because their bread is just so good. Definitely worth a try and a great spot especially when the weather is nice. Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor and I believe the patio is dog friendly. A nice place for good food and cool hangs."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after my friend's graduation from ASU. There were 6 of us in the group and we had a wonderful time. I liked the simplicity of the restaurant - both in the concept and decor. The food was flavorful and delicious. I had one of the Italian pasties and it was like a folded pizza. It's a great place for a casual meal with friends."}
{"text":"I gotta give them 5 stars.  I love the old house ambiance and the friendly service.  My Italian pasty was excellent and enough for two meals.  They have a great beer selection.  Be sure to enjoy their patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I was hesitant at first about going here because I was clueless as to what a pasty was. I'm glad I didn't let that stop me! I got the oggie and it was fantastic. The staff at the restaurant was helpful with giving recommendations. I will be back and will try as many as possible. The world needs more pasties. Thank you Cornish Pasty Company for introducing this palette to something divine!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty just keeps getting better and better!  I love the original Tempe location, but the new one in Scottsdale is just perfect!  It still has a lot of the low key, hipster flare as the original, but it's slightly less grungy and easier to hang out for a while.  The space is great with lots of options for outdoor, bar, and table seating.  I like the vibe a lot and it's a nice alternative to the yuppy scottsdale area.  The food is still the same great fare!  As I've mentioned before, I'm a big fan of the veggie options because they use great tasting meat substitute that is such a treat to have at a restaurant.  I eat meat, but these veggie options taste nearly the same.  Some of my favorites are the spicy asiago chicken, spicy bbq chicken and salmon.  The soups are also delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to love the creativity and randomness of the previous seasonal menu. I come to this specific location for the food and it is disappointing to see the same tired menu from the other locations."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan I'm well acquainted with pasties, those calzone/pies that mostly serve as a delicious vehicle for fillings. So when we found ourselves in this area around dinnertime we had to give it a try. I had a pastie with chicken, potatoes, and alfredo sauce, and hubs had one with chicken vindaloo. They were both fantastic, especially for non-traditional pasty fillings. I've had worse chicken vindaloo at some Indian restaurants. We also ordered a Scotch egg and potato leek soup, which were both excellent and exactly what I would have expected. Portions were generous- we both had enough to take half home.
I also had a sour beer, which I've never had before, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it since I'm not really a beer person. The decor was rustic but cozy and even on a Friday evening the service inside was friendly and the place was non-crowded. Parking wasn't the greatest and we ended up down the street, but that is the case pretty much anywhere in downtown Scottsdale. Overall, this was an awesome treat and we'll keep it in mind when we're on this side of town."}
{"text":"Something I never thought I'd say about this place. Draft beer selection sucks. They've gone all mellow on beer choices. Even though two from Firestone Walker they are yellow fizzy uninspired beers. Luckily they do have stone's enjoy by in bomber bottles and they did have old Rasputin which is solid."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We probably dine here every other week...Super affordable, good selection of pasties and beers, and the wait staff is great.  I love that they have vegetarian options like the veggie pesto chicken, and my husband enjoys their spicier carne adovada option. The pasties are pretty decent in size and definitely filling/hearty...think huge empanada. There are no substitutions for the ingredients, however w as many options as they have on their menu, there's something for everyone. If your one who likes British food, you'll find some staples like mushy peas, or bangers and mash. The restaurant is a come in and sit where you please kinda place- inside or outside on their patio. 
Definitely save room for their dessert. Their bread pudding is amazing!"}
{"text":"i'm from North New Jersey, this place made me forget i was in Arizona. i felt like i was back east. the food is well priced, great portions, and the menu has diversity. that atmosphere is relaxed but very nice, dinning and bar are separated, and there is additional outdoor seating (complete with misters).  I can't begin to say how amazing the staff is. Everyone is friendly and pleasant, making the experience that much more enjoyable. The Manager Justin makes himself available for your opinions. My waitress Christina was no only helpful with helping me wit the menu choices, but was genuinely enthused over their food, and eager to share her favourites.  This will be my new go to place when i want to go out."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere, nice lighting. Seating is a little awkward. Sat in the corner, felt like you were trapped. Food was delicious, and staff very pleasant. Parking is very limited but nothing to gripe over."}
{"text":"Came with my daughter. OMG it was soo delicious.  Especially the way the crust is made.  So light & flaky.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow...what a cool find in Old Town Scottsdale. Alex was a great server. She made us feel like family. The food was great and diiferent. Love the shepherds pie."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great beer and tasty Pastys- this is the place to go! Been here a handful of times and never leave disappointed. My favorites are The Italian and The All Day Breakfast. My kids LOVE the Royale and the PB & J. We all love the Parliament wings. My husband literally likes everything here. So, why only 3 stars? The service can be a little slow and the parking sucks. But truly, the food and the fun/kind staff make it worth it."}
{"text":"This place seems to have a real identity crisis. My sis and I went one time and tried to find it again and asked everyone in old town about it and they didn't know where it was. My pasty was good. Soup was AMAZING. Disappointed that our server had no idea what an Irish Coffee was, she asked the bartender that did not know how to make one. I shared with her how to make it and bartender must have been snowed because we were completely ignored after that. Will try again. Bartenders and servers need more training. Kitchen was spot on."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update a review I had written a month ago -- 


Really appreciate the response from the management team when I addressed a bad experience I had -- Service has been phenomenal last few times I have gone to Cornish! Great experience all around :)"}
{"text":"1.. Scottish egg $5.50 good (1 egg cut into 4 with meat wrapped around) 
2. Oggie original with rutabaga and red wine sauce $9.25 with 1lb of meat. Heavy so good to share 
3. Pasty beer $4 light

Overall good experience. Restroom outside and a bit confusing. Indoor and outdoor seating. Music can be A bit Loud indoors but the food itself came our fresh and hot. Service good.  

Recommend in Tempe since nothing else seems different or authentic"}
{"text":"Yelp Bff recommended this place. Perfect day drinking spot with rich food to keep tummy happy. Pasty was flaky, buttery, and selection of filings are from international cuisine. Beautiful patio. Great place to get together with friends. Perfectly priced food and beer. Big draft selection."}
{"text":"I was looking for a dog friendly patio to have lunch w/ a friend...not only are dogs allowed on their patio but they made us feel so welcome :).  Wide selection of every type of pasty you could imagine.  I also picked this spot because they had a wide range of vegetarian options (vs. other places with just one or two things).   My pasta salad was huge, flavors were on point, nice fresh ingredients! My friend had the Greek pasty that she let me try...Delish! Service was excellent! Friendliest staff I've come across in a while..will be back for sure with more friends!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I loved the food. I had the tandoori chicken wings, the roasted potatoes and the Guinness stew pasty. Oh 3 Moscow mules too haha. The food is so damn good. I was a little skeptical about the size but the pasty fills you right up. The Guinness! Delicious! Our server is was super cool and nice too. Great place to eat, drink and hang out. I was visiting from California and yeah stumbled upon this place. Ya gotta check it out if you're visiting! Thanks for the delicious food and excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location was my introduction to Cornish and what a spot it is! Love the relaxed vibe and the patio is an awesome space.

I wasn't too sold on a pasty until I had one.  I couldn't wrap my brain around the concept for some reason.  I've been quite a few times now and each time I go I try a new pasty and haven't had a bad one yet.  My favorite is a tie between the Reuben and The Shepherd's Pie.

The beer list is extensive if you like beer.  I always go for the Moscow Mule they have to offer (thanks for using Crabbie's ginger beer!)."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for a sit-down dinner place. They've got something for everyone, meat-and-potato guys, vegans, left field diners. Prices are pretty reasonable for a sit-down joint, and the portions promise that there's always leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and was there with the ISCUYE.  I liked the layout of this one better than the one in Mesa. Cheryl B and I ordered the Pesto chicken and the Cajun chicken and swapped halves.  I think the Cajun (her choice) was a bit better but both were good.  For such a large group the service was very good. Parking turned out to be easy as there was space in the lot and on the streets."}
{"text":"I go to Cornish all of the time (all 3 locations) and I love all of their pasties! The food is always good and the prices cant be beat! The Scottish eggs are excellent and to my surprise their salads are amazing too! Make sure to leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Tons of hype for this place. I'm not from around these parts so I'm not sure I'm qualified to say anything less than amazing about pasties. I'll say this-- the vegan balsamic portabello pasty was really good for a non-pizza calzone. I know I shouldn't even utter these words, it's like blasphemy to all the pasty fans out there. I'm just saying, all I can think of is the Low Cal Calzone Zone."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday with friends and it was stellar. The service was great & the food even better. Our waitress was extremely attentive. The restaurant itself is set up so adorably. It was a little dimly lit but, that's my only real complaint."}
{"text":"The Cornish Pasty Co was the place picked for February's International Supper Club UYE, and again I was excited to try them out, I have been hearing about how good they are, had no clear idea of what they are but was ready to find out for myself!

I arrived a little early so I ordered a Four Peaks Peach Ale so enjoy while waiting. Also cruised the menu too, so many to choose from, how does one make the right choice when trying them for the 1st time.

When it came time to order I went with something that was new to the menu, it was a spicy bbq chicken pasty with a side of slaw. I guess the best way to describe a pasty would be like a grown up hot pocket. Because everything is made fresh in the morning, there is no substituting anything, so order what you know you will like.  My pasty was the bomb! I had been worried thinking it would be more of a pot pie kind of texture (I don't like pie crust) but I can safely say it's more a bread texture. I can't believe I waited so long to try them! Before I knew it, mine was gone!

Service was great and fast! Another great time at ISCUYE!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of cornish pasty. This is a place you can try something new every time and love it.  My favorites are the Shepards Pie, lamb and mint, and the Italien. They also have solid appetizers and delicious deserts. Their beer selection is top notch, and they have amazing specials on Irish Car bombs. If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out."}
{"text":"This new location is fantastic! Patio is great with misters, making it possible to eat outside during the summer. The inside is very nice also. Hipster atmosphere but not too much. The food is delicious, obviously... Long list of choices for pasty! I came in with friends and they were pretty quick to accomodate for a party of 10. Will def come back! So glad we don't have to drive to Tempe anymore to go to a Cornish Pasty :)"}
{"text":"Food deserves 5 stars. I always sit at the bar, and the service is just so slow, I have been here many times and always sit for a good ten min before being waited on and the slow service continues on throughout the visit. The staff is very nice, I never feel like the bar is crazy swamped but just takes forever to get the attention of someone."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time. Loved it. I had the Chicken Pot Pie and my wife had the Shepherd's Pie Pasty. Both were excellent. Price is reasonable for the portion size. They also serve beer and wine. I believe they have 5 locations we were at the Old Town Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 of the locations in the valley and all three are awesome. They have consistently good food a variety of options and a great beer selection. My favorite is the original sin elderberry cider which I haven't been able to find anywhere other than cornish.  Anytime we have friends in town cornish is one of our favorite places to share."}
{"text":"Came In for lunch and it enjoyed it! Both me and my friend ordered the bangers and mash -- classic England! My server was nice and easy going, and sitting on the patio I could play a bit with a neighboring dog (patio is dog friendly)! The only thing was that we had to wait over 20 minutes for our meal. However, our server also remarked on the tardiness saying it usually doesn't take this long, which was good of her to do. 

All in all it was a good experience. I'll come back later in the evening next time. Have a pint of Guinness.. Or three! Cheers!"}
{"text":"If you're from az, more specifically Tempe/Mesa area, you have grown up with pasty over the years and it's still amazing. They have a great selection of beer and if you don't know what a pasty is, then you should probably go there now and try it out. 

I have been on the lovely bit of salmon for a while now and love the tomato soup too. My gf always goes for the mashed potatoes which I admit are pretty awesome too. 

Check it out"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times...never had a bad experience! The servers are always friendly and welcoming, the food is always good (I almost always get the Oggie), awesome selection of beers (I got the boddingtons tonight), and it's just a nice place to sit down and get away from work with friends.
Tonight I just stopped in for a quick bite. Service was fast. Caitlin was my server, she's always awesome, thanks Caitlin! The beer and Oggie hit the spot after a long week, can't wait to come back next time!"}
{"text":"First time there , place was clean food was great and they are open late will def go again for sure , love the vast variety of items they had ."}
{"text":"Just had the chicken pot pie pasty and OMG it was incredible. A must try. 

Can't wait for the Phoenix location!"}
{"text":"I'm English man and I must say they have this cornish pasty down.... I had the mint lamb amazing pastry real good .... wifey went for the traditional and her head has not come up from the plate yet... great job well done Cornish Pasty Co"}
{"text":"Really like the Tempe location but LOVE THIS ONE!  We always go to Tempe because it's closer to home but many times we just do take out because it's so college-bar-dark-and-dreary...  Now we have the open air bar feel that is SO much more appropriate for Arizona. Yay!"}
{"text":"Love the food here all the pasty's are so tasty! Made to order and you can also order to pick up and have another for you to heat up in your own oven for another time!!"}
{"text":"An update--

They did find my card! As expected. The GM & owner called me this morning and apologized for the customer service. I do think it is really nice that the two of them personally called me to let me know they appreciate the honest review and they are handling the situation. They really showed they care about their customers and that goes a long way! Thanks again Dean & Justin."}
{"text":"Just took out of town friends here.  Atmosphere is fun & casual.  Food is always tasty.  There is a nice patio.   Craft beer selection is good, not great.  I love ordering the lamb vindaloo."}
{"text":"This is not a good location I have dined at other locations and this one is sub par and the staff cares more about talking to themselves than serving customers. I ordered a stella and the bartender comes back and pours me an Amstel Light not even close then she gives the beer away to another patron next I order a chicken pot pie pasty to go so I could bring it back to my hotel and I get a nasty Mexican chicken pasty not what I ordered. They need to work on customer service at this location."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Cornish Pasty Company.  I arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Sunday.  I was surprised that it seems like much more of a bar than a restaurant.  The basic pasty was quite good, but the atmosphere for dining was absolutely horrible.  The \"music\" they were playing was mostly noise.  When I mentioned to the server that it was not exactly dining music, she reported that the bartender had said the same thing.  Unfortunately, they didn't change the music and I wound up eating my pasty in the midst of some of the worst noise I've heard in a dining establishment.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cornish Pasty Co? Hot pockets us for foodies still applies. Great vegetarian and vegan options too, if you aren't a carnivore. Go for the Rosemary Chicken. It's fabulous."}
{"text":"What a charming place with wonderful staff.

I came here with my Sis and her kids during my visit on Memorial Day Weekend.  Thankful that I had the whole brood with me as  I was able to take a bite out of everyone's pie. 

Ordered:
Scotch Eggs - tasty, however I would've preferred the yolk to be more on the medium side
Lovely Bit a Salmon - refreshing, the lighter choice from all the other pies 
Bangers and Mash - can't go wrong with this sausage and mashed potato
Shepherds Pie - another classic treat in a pie
The Oggie - perfect with a great wine aroma
Sticky Toffee Pudding - comes to you hot a la mode or with creme anglais (or both), we opted for just the creme anglais. 

London Mule - a wonderful accompanied to wash down the pie

All the crusts were perfect and this pie lover is in heaven.

The atmosphere was warm and friendly. The staff attentive.  This is truly a gem in downtown Scottsdale. 

Thanks Yelp for leading me to this great establishment. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience last night was great. Excellent food, we had the lamb vindaloo pasty and the spinach walnut soup. So delicious! The alcohol selection is well thought out, I got to try a new sour beer and a locally sourced bourbon whiskey from Tempe. I can't wait to go back and try more things. The staff was friendly and the service was prompt. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Loved it. Went for the first time on Friday night. Great atmosphere. Had the most engaging waiter EVAN! Thank you Evan for making our first pasty experience fantastic. I had the Pilgrim and my daughter had the Meat and Cheese. The pasty is more than enough food. The oven chips were good. Loved it! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Longer wait than I am usually accustomed to at a restaurant, but prices were fair and food quality was excellent."}
{"text":"Just fantastic!!  Great spirits and over flowing with scrumptious delicious well prepared meals. Very filling and tasty. 
Having a inside or outside seating is really fun. Snd the place is big enough to enjoy bringing all your friends. Prices are very reasonable!
My absolute fav is the pepper steak pasty with whisky sauce.  !!!!! Oh my god!!!!!wow. The Greek Salad is superb and the small salads are huge!!!
The service is up best snd way friendly even when packed!
One of the best places to eat in old town Scottsdale!!
As a bonus they will half bake is dries for you for take out. Bring it home and finish in your own k en!! Fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"If there is 6th Star, I would give it 6 star for the great taste of Pasty, chill environment and natural friendly staff! 

Environment: Super Chill
Food: 5 Star+
Staff: Very friendly

Tomato Soup with homemade bread -
 chewy and melted as you chew the bread. I would buy a whole package and eat everyday if I'm not in a fitness program, and too bad it's their homemade only.

Scotch Egg - 
not bad, good addition; not impressive though.

Salmon, ham, melted cheese pasty -
it tastes way x3 better than it looks. Hot & Crispy pasty. Can't explain how much satisfaction it gives. Never had better \"Sandwich\", period! 

Hot Sticky Toffee Pudding -
Hot Pudding vs cold ice cream. Put the ice cream in it and you won't forget this taste. It's the taste of childhood."}
{"text":"The best comfort food around. The vibe is welcoming and the servers are knowledgeable. 

Be mindful that everything is house made so sometimes the are out of things; but just utilize that opportunity to try something new"}
{"text":"This is another great location for this chain! We headed out here after discovering the place we attempted to go to dinner closed at 4 p.m. on Sundays, so since this was only a mile away from where we were and had been on both our bookmark lists for some time, it was meant to be!

The ambiance at this location is great. It has a very laid back feel and plenty of seating in break off rooms throughout. it is a seat yourself place and picking which seat you want can be a challenge with all the great options - inside at the bar to watch all the action, outside with the misters and bar feel, or in one of the knooks with a more private feel??

We love to sit at the bar and watch people work, so we took some front row seats and were greeted by our waitress. She took our drink orders and we opted to get the Bangers and Mash and the Porky and both eat half so we get two different flavors each! They were both excellent, but my personal fave was the Bangers cause it was just stuffed with filling and the mashed potatoes were perfect.

At the end we opted to split an Apple dessert pasty with ice cream, and it was just as delectable as it sounds! The staff were all friendly and watching them work was fascinating / hypnotic. 

Overall: A+
Dinner and a show if you sit at the bar and watch them work their magic!"}
{"text":"The bean dip was bland and flavorless.  The pasty's tasted like they were premade, frozen and heated up.  Not fresh and made to order.  Yuck!  Yelpers you let me down!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy fun food with also sorts of interesting flavor combinations. Adorable surroundings. My only criticism is the wait staff. We were there at lunchtime and they seemed generally disinterested and unhelpful. Customer service is important to me, so that was kind of disappointing, but the fabulous food and the good company of my friend made up for it."}
{"text":"I never had a pasty before but visited here for a quick dinner and ate a Chicken Pie pasty. Delicious. I could have eaten two of them right then and there. It was a fun place with a good atmosphere and excellent food. Definitely worth your time and money to visit."}
{"text":"Wow!! I have been going to the Cornish Pasty for the past few years!! Usually a great time!!  This location is a sh@& show!  Way way way understaffed, and excuses for everything! They were also out of a bunch of the things we ordered, including beer and food, and the bar tender was on his own pace!! I have no desire to return here, which is too bad as the other locations are great!"}
{"text":"It was so good we went twice in a weekend. Very unique fillings for pasties. Its more of a bar than a restaurant, but we had no problems taking the kids with us. They have vegetarian options. Parking is mostly street parking."}
{"text":"Calling all hipsters: your home has been found!

I have enjoyed the Cornish Pasty Co.'s in Tempe and Mesa; Scottsdale's locale does not disappoint. Yes, the crowd is different. Rather than college kids looking for good food or the older crowd looking for their silverware in the darkness of Mesa, you get more of a hipster/Old Town vibe. The ambiance isn't as unique as other locations. From lighting and use of space, it doesn't compare to other locations.

But the food is better. The portions are bigger. The pasties are tastier. If you are looking for outstanding food just off the Old Town strip, you are home. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Preface: this review is for the last couple of months visits at this location. The past three years as a weekly customer have been fine up until now. 

In the past two months, it appears they have gone through some staffing changes. The same people aren't around anymore, one of the bartenders moved to a different location, and the new wait staff is very non-attentive. The tables and bar have been dirty each time I went in. Employees spend more time talking to each other than handling customers. 

The food has been poor and inconsistent. In the last three visits alone, my pasties have been either overcooked or undercooked. On the occasion they were undercooked, the dough wasn't fully baked. I complained, and was brought back the same exact pasty, but now had sat in an oven for twenty more minutes and was overcooked. 

The other issue is that they often are now \"out of\" items on the menu. On four separate occasions, I tried to order certain pasties only to be told that they were out of them. One time I had to go through five different choices to find one I liked that they actually had available, until I had to ask for a list of what they even had. How does this happen, I ask? It seems to me that the pasties are pre-made at a certain point in the week, frozen, and then baked to order. But if they run out, they run out until they make more. How can you be out of basic menu items like chicken pot pie? It doesn't make a lot of sense. 

I'd avoid this location until they get their priorities back in line and make some serious changes. Management should take a good look at what is actually happening here and fix the issues at hand. 

To the owner, if you read these reviews: I'd love an explanation of what is going on here. I've come to this location weekly since it opened and now don't have any reason to keep going."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since they opened in Scottsdale. B4 that, went to the one in Tempe when it was tiny tiny.  Its always been great!  My family grew up making pasties in the Midwest.  We love eating pasties.  Took my family from the Midwest to the Scottsdale location about a month ago.  12 of us.  Half ordered the oggie.  Took a long time to get our food, which we were fine with.  When the pasties were served, the oggie's were not even close to being done, the potato's were crunchy hard and bruised.  I tried one, super disappointing!  My mom talked to the manager.  She, the manager, made a comment, I told them they needed to stay in the oven longer. What?! Really?!  Very disappointing, considering my family grew up eating pasties and I'm telling them they are as good or better than what we grew up with. Manager credited our bill, that was it.
Today, my fiance and I are out and about.  She says, let's go to the pasty co, by our house in old town.  She wanted to get the pilgram and broc cauliflower bake.  OK, we go, sit down outside, no one comes for 10min, my fiance goes in and asks if we can get served w menus?  Waitress apologizes, brings us menus.  Also, she brings a list of everything they are out of.  Broccoli and  cauliflower is on the list of 20 or so things they are out of.  OK, she orders the pilgram and I order lamb n mint.  Waitress comes back, sorry, we are out of the pilgram also.  We decided to go somewhere else to eat.  Sad to say, we may try them one more time down the road, but 3 strikes and they will be out.  What's going on CPC? New management or lack there of?"}
{"text":"Overrated! Was looking forward to this place after reading the reviews, and was disappointed. The meatball appetizer was nasty. I took a bite and spite it out. The meat tasted very very low quality. When I got my pasty it was the same. The meat had no flavor and tasted like it was opened from a deli pack and slapped on the grill. For how expensive this place is you would think they would have decent quality meat. 60$ for 2 pasty's and a appetizer....and all of it was gross. The customer service was great though, sadly I would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Very rude customer service and dry/burnt tandoori wings. I love the other locations, sorry not going back to this one."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a golden flaky crust filled with almost anything your heart could desire? A true Pasty shop with the ambiance of an English style Pub. The patio is lovely and the interior is equally as nice. The service was upbeat and friendly as well as fast! 
Started with the scotch Egg, a good size $5 appetizer, with that perfectly toasted bread crumb outer layer and savory sausage that encased the egg ... one of the best I've had ... no I'm sure it was the best ever! Came with a brown mustard dipping sauce, super yum! 
I ordered the lamb Sheppard pie Pasty and it was huge! I brought the other half to my other half and he loved it! The red wine sauce that accompanied the Pasty was excellent as well. 
I ended with my favorite dessert the sticky toffee pudding with salted caramel so decadent and filling especially with the vanilla ice cream. The toffee pudding is served in a mini cast iron skillet and as with any cast iron you must know what you're doing or your dish will burn ( or look burnt yuck!) Not this pudding though, it was toasty on the outside and moist on the inside. The extra salted caramel to top it with sealed the deal! 
If you're in Old Town Scottsdale and you want to pass on the typical bar food please check this 5 star Brit pub! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Consistently awful service. I am actually astonished on how bad the service is every time I come. My friends and I were really disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. I haven't had a pasty since my days in MI. Large variety here. Not an intimate setting, ideal for groups. Large full service bar with indoor and outdoor seating. Bartender Coleen (friend of mine) does a nice job. Nice selection of beers at reasonable prices. Pasties are a complete meal in a pie crust, very filling. It was a fun time (monthly YELP International dinner).
This would be a good place to go for a lunch and sit outside in the Spring/Fall sun or for an outdoor happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been coming to CPC for 6 years and I've never had a bad pasty yet. My favorite are the Lamb Vindaloo and the Carne Adovada!! I promise you that once you try a pasty here you will be hooked for life!! Their apple dessert pasty is also as delicious as it sounds!!"}
{"text":"It's all about the ambience...and this place nails it! Fits into the Old Town fabric like a glove. Great indoor/outdoor bar, pastys are all delicious. Best of all, and definitely not least, this place is not the typical Scottsdale holier than thou place. Blue collar feel and staff. Welcome to the neighborhood  Cornish. Kick up your feet and stay awhile ;)

And the music...yeah, cool enough to play 'Bad' from U2. And it fit right in 
:)"}
{"text":"The Cajun chicken is:
Ten times better than any pizza out there.
The most tasty and filling food ever.
Vibe is very home cooked and large servings."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time here and is once again amazing. I had the Porky and that was my favorite out of all the pasties my family and I have had. I recommend that pasty for sure!"}
{"text":"This place sorta kicks ass.   If you're from the UK, you'll know this type of faire as comfort food.   If You're not, you're gonna try something a hair different.  

5 of us (including a dog) came here.  We loved it!  We got the Bangers and Mash, Shepherds Pie and Lovely Bit a Salmon.    

We shared and enjoyed the meal with a couple of beers and a glass of wine.   I was personally partial to the Bangers and Mash Pastie --- It was delicious.    The right flavors of where Bangers and Mash should be methinks.  

Yeah, we'll be back.   This is a helluva good place if you haven't been here already."}
{"text":"I just finished watching a volleyball game on a Sunday afternoon and was thinking of what to eat near the end of the game. I was hankering for something new and different so looking through my bookmarked locations on my Yelp app,  I remembered how I've been thinking about visiting the Cornish Pasty for some time now. I decided to call my order in with the intention of easily picking it up and heading straight home afterwards. The voice on the other end of the phone let me know that my order would be ready in 20 or 30 minutes. I can't remember exactly. I didn't have a difficult time locating it although it's not exactly in the middle of the more high-traffic pedestrian areas of Old Town Scottsdale. When I first arrived, I noticed the parking lot wasn't huge, although, there were plenty of areas to park within the area. I found a separate parking lot a block away. Out of curiosity and just not being familiar with the area, I walked around the Cornish Pasty before I found the main doors. You'll find seating both outside and inside. There weren't anyone outside at the time and not a lot inside. That's what happens on a late Sunday afternoon in early September. The inside was pretty dark. It was too dark for my taste, but I loved the wooden tables and benches. It gives it a welcoming, unpretentious and casual vibe. The outside would be a great place to sit when the weather's cooler and you need a spot to hang out at after spending time in Old Town. My visit was short, but the staff inside was very welcoming and my order was ready for me. I ordered The Pilgrim and the Lovely Bit a Salmon. I first had The Pilgrim as soon as I got home and totally savored it. I completely forgot that it came with some cranberry sauce and gravy so I actually ate it without them, but I still loved it. Later that evening for dinner, I had the Little Bit a Salmon and equally loved that too. I really should have saved my second pasty for the following day because these pasties are very filling. I think of them as comfort good. A nice warm pasty would go really well sitting outside at the Cornish Pasty during cooler weather and after finishing an event like a game. 

I was flip-flopping between 4 and 5 stars with my rating of Cornish Pasty; after all, I've only visited once as I type this review and it was only to pick up food. I'll go ahead and give it the benefit of the doubt since nothing really bad sticks out in my head regarding my one visit. I feel pretty confident the 5 stars will hold after many other visits. I look forward to those visits during the next few months."}
{"text":"We love the pasties here. No nonsense ambience. Laid back atmosphere to come chill with friends. Good beer and okay wine. 
We usually have the curried jalapeño dip with pita chips. And also the oven chips are pretty good. I love the rosemary chicken, pesto chicken and asiago chicken pasties.  Huge portions for desserts. Good to share. 
Tandoori wings are good too but not really done in traditional Indian tandoori way. 
Will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant with quaint wallpaper and vintage photos of miners, because pasties were invented as a convenient lunch for miners in Cornwall; the menu features a bit of history. They also serve the pasties on old-fashioned pewter plates. The food is delicious; they have a variety of vegan and vegetarian pasties. They have a large drink menu."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and it's been great. Unfortunately, it's gone down hill. 

About a month ago we brought a large groups of people here. When we received our food, all the Pastys that had potatoes in them were undercooked. The potatoes were brown, not white in color and where crunchy like they were raw. What made it worse is the manager said they knew they were undercooked. We took the other half of those Pastys home and cooked then another 30 minutes to no avail. They were horrible. 

Today, we came back for the first time since our last bad experience and it wasn't much better. We sat on the patio and after several minutes had to go to find someone to help us. When they finally came they told us they are out of several staple items. So we found something else. A couple minutes later the waitress came back and said they were out of those too. We decided to leave and go somewhere else. 

I'm not sure what's changed or going on there but they need to get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time last weekend. The place was pretty empty but our server was nice and our meal was delicious. 
As with the 1st time we came here, you can get a little lost in where to go when trying to get inside as there appear to be many doors. If you enter from the front of the place, there appears to be better signage as to where to go. We walked in and they told us to sit anywhere. They didn't appear to be very busy and our server showed up pretty quickly. 
I ordered the bangers and mash and boyfriend got the Italian. Both were delicious!!! I think it just depends on what mood I'm in for whatever flavor of pasty I get. We switched halves so if I got half of each. Each of us got a beer, which they have a pretty wide selection of beer (draft and bottles/cans) with some local beers to choose from. We also ended up getting the sticky toffee pudding dessert (only because the chocolate bread and butter pudding was sold out). We got it with ice cream and it was very delicious despite ours being just a touch overcooked.
We decided that we need to come to this place more often as the pasties are filling and delicious and go great with a beer! The only thing this place needs are some TVs to watch soccer games to go with the vibe of the restaurant! 
Overall, we will definitely add this place into our rotation of regular places to eat. If you haven't had a pasty before, give it a try! 
Also to be noted, they appear to have vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Lived in South Scottsdale for five years and somehow missed this excellent spot just because I never drive down that street. We tried the most popular choices and, they were tasty. Really good comfort type food. The setup of the place is great with no problem sitting at the bar and ordering your meal. This gives the added pleasure of people watching everyone as they arrive as well as an open air view of the walking street traffic in front. Nice service from the bartenders with everyone working as a team. Love that approach. This is not a high end spot but, delicious comfort food that seems to have an overwhelming loyal base of people."}
{"text":"So here we are again. My wife is eating the Greek salad with grilled chicken and as usual she shares her food with me. One little bite. Yummy. The chicken is moist and tasty. One star. The basil dressing is unusual for a Greek salad but it works. Yummy again. Two stars. I'm having the cream of leak and potato soup again, it's different from last time not as creamy, but the taste is there. The bread is impeccable. Three stars. The service is fast enough and professional. Four stars.  Yep we are coming back soon."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie is the BOMB! The portions are pretty big, so bring your appetite! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The binofee (sp?) pie dessert is INCREDIBLE!! I didn't much like the pasties as they were heavy, but if you're hungry they are perfect. The Caesar salad with salmon was excellent too. Great outdoor area!"}
{"text":"Cornish pasty was one of the first places I ever reviewed on yelp.  It started as a restaurant that seated maybe 30 people to the 3 location behemoth it is today.  I've heard they are opening a location downtown in the near future as well.
I finally got a chance to check out their new location in Old Town.  As usual it did not disappoint.  The GF and I split the Royale and a side of mashed potatoes and cheese.  I washed it down with a delicious Kronenbourg.  Love that beer.  They have a great beer selection.  You can get anything from Four Peaks to a bottle of mickeys.  Who doesn't like a mickeys every once in a while?
I am happy to see Cornish continue to grow.  I will continue to support it every chance I get."}
{"text":"This place still does not disappoint. 

Service and food are both quirky fun an delicious!!! Sunday can be a lot of fun at this place as the layout of the huge bar provides excellent people watching."}
{"text":"Who said Britain doesn't have a decent cuisine? Ok yes they may have stolen many authentic recipes but they sure as hell know how to find a great collaboration of delicious foods. Cornish pasty is no different. They have stuff that you arent an alien to but will be pleasantly surprised by their excellent mashup. Definitely try the rice, chicken, bean soup. That was an out of the park for me!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar on mill! I cycle through three or four pasties and they're amazing every time. Really nice and attentive bar tenders. I super love Jenessa and Andrea! They're the best EVER"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Cornish Past Co. for years now and love going to their expanded Tempe location. However, I was really excited to see the brand new Scottsdale location. It has a gorgeous outdoor patio and bar and the inside is very spacious with plenty of seating. It's really nice!

Tuesday must be a slower night because hardly anyone was there but my server was very friendly and my pasties were very good. They obviously have recipe and ingredient consistency between the different locations. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this location yet but I like the seating a little better. Feels a tad more open and less crammed. We went early to avoid the rush. Can be a tad difficult to park. Had the Royale this time and my wife had the Cottage. Mine was a little cooler than normal. You want it hot to keep warm as you eat through it. Mushy peas are a favorite and they were a little sweeter than usual. I like them savory. The Chips (fries) were ok. Service was good as usual. Prices on point. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love it here! It can get a little hot in the summer but the  wings make it worth it! I come to this location because they have the best wings I've ever had. Their soups are ALL great and I like to pair it with their grilled cheese! Of course the pasties are tasty and I highly recommend the chicken pot pie one!"}
{"text":"Woah. As much as I love the Tempe Cornish Pasty, this location kills it. It's a stark contrast, the Tempe location is dark and divey while this one is very open, lots of windows and natural light with a clean and welcoming feel. The new menu options are a great addition, and the design and layout are slick and eye catching. As much as it irks me to say it, I'd rather drive the ten minutes to this location than go to the one within biking distance of my house. It's like I was dating the Tempe location, but now that I've met her sister in Scottsdale, I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"The patio is beautiful, misters were on as well as the patio lights and the food is amazing! I had a pasty with turkey, yams and stuffing! Thanksgiving dinner in May! Yay! My husband had a pasty with a cheeseburger, bacon and mushrooms  inside! I tried a bite and it was delicious! We also tried the homemade garlic fries! Real fresh cut potatoes not frozen with garlic! Yum! Service was a little slow but the manager made up for it and bought our dessert! We had the banafee pie! Whipped cream, bananas, Carmel and really thick graham cracker crust! It feeds two! Also the pasty can feed two people if your not too big of an eater! It's huge! I will for sure be back! So many choices, maybe the sheppards  pie next time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A huge upgrade to the original location. Great beers a good prices. 

The name says it all, Cornish Pasty...aka the only English food that doesn't suck. Great outside bar... Perfect for day drinking."}
{"text":"Food is interesting, but good. Love the atmosphere and the staff. Great place to relax and enjoy something different."}
{"text":"A bit confused about the many 4 and 5 star reviews. Have wanted to try this place for a while. It seems popular enough. First, the place looks nice, comfortable seating however it is not. We arrived and it wasn't busy at all. We wandered in and weren't greeted, had to ask about seating. Service was mediocre at best. It took ages. The food was disappointing. We ordered a Rosemary Chicken, Cheese and Onion, Veggie Pesto Chicken and Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese.

Yes, the pasties are large and should be satisfying, they weren't. The Rosemary Chicken pasty was stuffed with slices of potato. My friend had to take them all out because they weren't cooked. They were hard. The waitress asked why she didn't eat the potatoes, she explained and said she could have taken it back and put it back in the oven. We could have, had she ever checked on us. The Cheese and Onion pasty was OK but unevenly cooked. The Veggie Pesto Chicken had little flavor. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese were lumpy, with bits of uncooked potato, a faint smell of garlic but not even a hint of garlic flavor.  

The good, place looks nice and the prices are great. The bad, mediocre service, uncomfortable seating -hard benches- and food is average at best."}
{"text":"Come on guys!  Come to Phoenix all the time and frequent this place. Ordered carry out on weds this week.   Picked up 3 pasties. One chicken pot pie and the potatoes were rock hard and the green beans not cooked. Gross. Nothing you Can do after getting home. Keep your he focus on quality so you dont tank. ."}
{"text":"food is excellent
service sucks ass
disorganized. appetizers come after the long waited main dish.
frequently run out of really popular pasties.
annoying as hell but unfortunately too addicted to the food not to return
grrrrr yum..."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment. This place is consistently delicious and I've never had a less-than-amazing experience! I refer anyone I know to this place, and everyone thanks me for the referral! I crave their food daily :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE! Great atmosphere, amazing food... The only thing I could complain about was the service. It was a Wednesday late after noon so not too busy and our waitress didn't come by much.

Other than that I would suggest the curry and carna ASADA dish and their fries!"}
{"text":"I got here about 10 minutes before my OkCupid date arrived, and no less then seven people ask me if I needed help, just in the first two minutes of me standing by the front door. They told me I could go sit at a table to wait for him, but instead I opted to watch the cooks in the kitchen. I did even know hairnets for beards (beardnets?) were a thing! 

I ordered a pear cider and it was the perfect compliment to the amazing leek and potato soup. My date was very engaging; I laughed too loudly and was very into him. Everything went so well, and he walked me to my car. 

When I got home, it was immediately brought to my attention that I had a giant piece of lettuce between my front teeth, which had no doubt been there for at least five hours, since my salad at lunch. 

I hope he sees that as me being into clean eating, instead of seeing it as me being a disgusting slob."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new for lunch in Old Town Scottsdale last Friday. With a recommendation from a friend we decided on Cornish Pasty. There was such a selection of different combinations wrapped in a pastry shell. I chose the Pilgrim. It was so good. It was Thanksgiving in a shell. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it took quite a while to get our food. It wasn't very busy and we only had an hour for lunch. We ended up having to take most out food to go. I wouldn't have minded the wait if we had more time. It looks like a cool hangout."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this CPC (CP?) location. I've been to the one in Phoenix, Scottsdale, and the original Tempe restaurant. I was nearby and decided to order some pastys to go. It's a small location, there's a couple of seats outside and some inside as well. I chose veggie chicken tikka masala (red curry), one of my favorites, and tried a new one: veggie pesto chicken. Both of these are made with Quorn, a brand of mock chicken that's not my favorite but it's okay. If everything else in the pasty meshes together, the chicken is secondary.

I love my go-to pasty, bursting with flavor and spices from the green peppers, potatoes, and tikka masala sauce. It comes with a yogurt sauce which is sweeter than I'd like but a cool companion to the spicy flavor. I didn't really enjoy the pesto chicken; it had artichokes, mushrooms, mozzarella and pesto and a side of marinara sauce, which was good. I don't think the filling ingredients worked well together, at least not for me. 

Love that they have so many veggie options and even a few vegan ones. This is a great dining spot for eating outside during these cooler months."}
{"text":"I came here about two months ago on my way home from work to grab a pasty. I was craving one and ordering was easy. I stopped in at the bar and placed my order for a Veggie BBQ Spicy Chicken with sides of the sauce and coleslaw. My food was ready in 5 min or so since I asked for it half prepared. It was convenient to be able to take it home and pop it in the oven and have a hot and fresh pasty to eat.

I have no qualms about this place even though the signage on the front didn't immediately catch my attention. Food is always tasty and love the vegetarian and seafood (only one) selections."}
{"text":"Their special drink, root beer float with house make liquor ice cream, is so great. The creamy rich ice cream with not your father root beer went well together. It made me forgot about their delicious warm pasty for a moment."}
{"text":"What a disaster! We checked in and we're told \"it will be just a few minutes\" and were directed to the bar to wait. So we went to the bar area. For an hour. With two small kids. Things were getting desperate so I went to ask the hostess how long and she replied \"oh at least 45 minutes\"....wait a second. What?! If the wait is an hour and 45 minutes....and especially if one patron is handicapped and two are kids...you'd think you'd disclose that up front. We ended up settling our bar tab and leaving, but not before the surly bartender made sure to toss in a few disparaging remarks meant to make us feel shitty for being hungry and unwilling to wait nearly two hours to eat. No pasty is that good."}
{"text":"The food is good, but go to the Scottsdale location so you can get a seat and a view. This place is smooshed into a alley-like space that is dark and there is almost no seating. Maybe take out and eat on the bench in the park (if they are not full of people). The food is similar to Scottsdale location. It is good, and I recommend you try the pasty here. Just expect to be jammed in at this site. Oh and there is beer here. And a bar. Plus...."}
{"text":"The coveted five stars. Sought by many but delivered so rarely. I had no idea this was such a great place. Tons of indoor and outdoor seating. Great beers. Nice, not-too-dark but could be romantic lighting. And you can watch them prepare your food which is kinda cool. They had wings, which were not the stars here but we were forgiving because the pasty's (PASS-TEES) were something everyone needs to try. 

A pasty is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England. It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. After baking, the result is a raised semicircular food item.

Kind of like a super pot pie with great choices of fillings. The Oggie (Meat and potatoes) and Reuben were faves. The Italian was so-so, but who would think crossing Britain with Italy would work out?

Skip the wings, go for the prime objective, and follow it up with the chocolate cake which is semi-lava hot and crispy. Need I say more? Great date spot. We saw a lot of that. Service great, clean, several locales. Oh, and did I say beer?"}
{"text":"I have been in love with Cornish Pasty Co. since they opened in Tempe in 2005. Since then, they've opened a location in Mesa and now a location in Scottsdale. I have been waiting for a Scottsdale location for years and my wish was finally granted! 

My husband and I have been here twice since they've opened. The first time we came for dinner. We found parking easily, but I can see how the parking lot could fill up fast. There is no hostess station, it's more of a seat yourself establishment. If you catch a waiter's eye, they'll tell you to sit wherever you wish. I'm totally cool with this. Luckily, there is a lot of seating - both inside and out. We chose to sit outside, so we could enjoy the patio. The patio is large with an awesome bar, a square table fitted around a tree, and large liquor barrels stationed about (for decoration/tables). Our waitress was quick to stop by for drink orders. When she brought us waters, we were ready to order food. The Scottsdale location has some new appetizers that the Tempe location doesn't, so we decided to try something new the Parliament Wings. My husband ordered the lamb and mint pasty and I ordered a bowl of soup - my favorite being the cream of leak with potato and Stilton. Our wings were quick to arrive and were tasty. Not the best wings I've ever had, but still good. The soup and pasty arrived as we were just finishing up the wings. They were delicious and tasted just how we expected. (I would highly recommend the soup - especially if you like Stilton or any blue cheese. It is tangy and smooth. It also comes with some house made bread which is scrumptious.) It was a very good meal and definitely lived up to the high expectations we had. 

Our second visit was for lunch. We decided to try the Cornish Meatballs (another new appetizer) and ordered a pasty to split. The meatballs were different but good. The meatballs are wrapped in bacon and come in a small cauldron like pot which has croutons, sautéed onions, and a tangy mustard-like sauce. Again, our pasty was delicious. (I love their crust; the little braid on top is my fav.) 

Overall, I would say this is a great success and I will definitely be back. I am super excited to finally have a Scottsdale location so I can now get my pasty fix whenever I want!"}
{"text":"If you are vegan and you love pot pie you have to try this place! I haven't had pasties before, but finding out that they have vegan options peaked my curiosity.  Their menu says Vegetarian and Vegan options, but the vegan options are actually not listed - you have to ask your server what the vegan specials are. There are usually 2 every night, but there was only 1 the night we went - the Greek. It came with a side of tahini sauce. With and without the tahini it was oozing with flavor and vegan cheeze and vegetables once I cut it open. The crust was easy to cut with a fork and reminded me of pie. Maybe you've had pasties before and you know what I'm talking about (lucky). For those who haven't had a pasty before, it's kind of like a fancy hot pocket and about 2-3 times the size, but tastes more like a delicious homemade pot pie straight out of the oven. They are filling. I could barely finish mine, but I had some help. The oven potatoes and red potatoes are also (or can be made) vegan - confirm with your server since it doesn't say so on the menu! We ordered the oven fries with garlic. We had to get a second order because they were popular at our table. 

They do custom vegan pasties, made with the available ingredients on the menu, but you have to call and order them about an hour in advance - it takes time to make the perfect food (or second perfect food depending on where you rank burritos).

If you're feeling social, they have a couple of long community tables and a good beer selection (and I think a full bar too). Great place to meet friends for dinner. Looking forward to my next pasty!"}
{"text":"Visited this location as a recommendation from the Valley Ho Hotel and it did not  disappoint. Not my kind of food  for everyday (heavy and rich) but the concept and flavor combos are AWESOME!!! great for a group of people who like different flavors."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it wasn't too crazy crowded. We were able to find some seats at the benches for a group of 7, no problem. It was my first time here so I got the Oggie as many people has suggested on Yelp. The crust wasn't as flaky as I had imagined and was almost a bit doughy on the part where they pinch the pasty together. Meat and potato filling was slightly bland, so definitely the wine sauce helped resolve that issue. I actually would have liked more of the sauce. Also got the try the apple pasty and banana desserts. I really enjoyed the graham cracker crust on the banana dessert! Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Very tasty little soft pasties oh yum yes, this place is a neat treat that is one to defeat! A little heafty on the price per portion but none the less the flavor is worth coming back for more! Can't wait to try more of these delicious little dough delights!"}
{"text":"Ok - I am confused about the hype of Cornish Pasty Co. Staff wasn't friendly nor helpful, we stood in the entry walking around for several minutes looking lost and confused (they were empty) and no one acknowledged us until I finally acknowledged them. I ordered the bangers and mash pasty which was blah, no flavor - tons of potatoes but no meat - whats up with that? The chicken liver pate was delish though.

The real kicker is that I got sick off of their food that evening - Super disappointed since they were one of the restaurants on my places I needed to check out in the Valley."}
{"text":"I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but the pasty was huge! Deliciousness stuffed in pie dough with a side of mustard sauce. The cheesy broccoli bake was also a winner. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness....the pilgrim is the best savory thing I have ever eaten in a pastry crust. It was thanksgiving, perfectly executed and tucked into a flakey, not at all soggy, pillow of heaven...served with gravy and cranberry sauce. If youre doing it right, you slather both all over your pastry to get a bit in every bite. I want to try every pasty and cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times now, always enjoyed it. But that's not a real review, or at least a real good one. 

Today I took my English friends here, straight from London and they're food difficult, largely do to the fact that Britain and there friggen curries are the greatest food purveyors in the world. That's right world.

So, as we walked up I already sensed the impending disaster as my friends wife had to correct the way Pasty was spelled to Pastie. Now I knew I was gonna hear it. Was I just becoming a patriot. 

Kristine and her trainee were our servers, both were sweethearts and couldn't be more professional. I felt instantly sorry for them as a now dreaded the English culinary snobs. 

She ordered the Oggie which is the Traditional pasty, he ordered the steak and Stilton and I your humble write ordered the Roast Beef dinner. 

When I got the omg look and the this is the best pasty I ever had! I was shocked. I was shocked that suddenly America has won, and they won this silent was from a pasty shop."}
{"text":"Love the scene and the food! All of us really enjoyed the pastries! Highly recommend giving this place a try! The peppered steak had good flavor and the sauce was bold but tasteful!"}
{"text":"If you are a chocoholic, the chocolate bread pudding is a must have! Super decadent, gooey and some crunchy bits. Tried the parliament wings and it was ok, the sauce was too sweet for me. The French fries are delicious, made fresh and served with grilled fresh jalapeño....yum! My hubby ordered the BBQ chicken pastry and it was good too."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group. They had a great patio seating set up. Beer selection was good.

I ordered the pastrami pasty - which sounds like a salt overload waiting to happen. It was delicious - baked to a perfect golden brown. The portion size was fairly large and I definitely enjoyed the generous helping of meat in the pasty. Given the portion size, the price was reasonable. Pasties come by itself, but sides are available as additional orders. As I was not that hungry, I elected to just have the pasty.

Good place for some comfort food."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pasties with a ton of combinations waiting for you.the drinks combination is great and the vibe is cool and casual."}
{"text":"Grew up eating Cornish Pasties.  Very disappointed.  My Office original pastime was dough and potatoes with just a trace of meat.  Did not eat it."}
{"text":"Lunch was very delicious. We tried the chicken pot pie. Wait time was almost no existent. They have indoor and outdoor seating. After we ordered, the appetizers came out quickly. The entrees were hot and freshly made. I would of liked to try some of the beers, but with a meeting later on I had to pass."}
{"text":"Alex was so kind and accommodating! We loved dinning here because of her sweet attitude and effort as our server. Will come back and would definitely recommend! Food was excellent as well! Try the wings"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that this has been added to Old Town.  What a fantastic porch!!!  We were so pleasantly surprised when we came up.  This place refurbished two old houses/modular homes or something and we all watched it go up thinking \"what in the world is this joint going to be?\". 

Well, the patio is huge.  It contains a huge booth area around a tree, large seating areas outside (now with heat lamps, so hopefully misters in the hot months), an indoor/outdoor bar.  Great music outside as well. 

In addition, the food is great.  I have had the read deal with pasties, and I didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.  I opted for the lamb and mint pasty because I'm a lamb fiend.  It was divine.  inside the pasty was lamb, mint, rutabagas, potatoes and a side of red wine sauce.  So rich and filling.    Everyone at my table also got a pasty and loved it. One of my friends got a vegetarian option and wasn't that thrilled, but honestly, vegetarian anything usually is only half decent. 

the prices are reasonable, the pasties are large and the atmosphere is laid back. Great addition!"}
{"text":"I would like to give it a 3 1/2 because it is really good and unique. No happy hour specials and limited seating, but when the weather is nice there's an outside bar and tables which nice. The bathroom is around the corner, which was annoying.  The shepherds pie Pasty was excellent and my mom liked her Guinness stew Pasty.  They were about $12 each and there's no sides or anything.  It's right across the street from Baked Bear, which is my favorite dessert spot in the area so that's a nice plus."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique. I had the meat and cheese and my son had the royale with cheese, both delicious.  The dipping sauces were great and the entire experience new and different."}
{"text":"The concept is very simple, but it has been executed flawlessly. The British Cornish Pasty is the Spanish empanada, the Jamaican patty, the Indian samosa. It is essentially meat and veg wrapped in pastry then baked. Done right it can be delicious!

I'm English. I grew up eating pasties. Although being from the north-west of England the pasties I ate weren't Cornish, they were a variation of the Irish pasty. Same concept, but lighter pastry, flakey, almost puff pastry. I always thought the crust of a true Cornish pasty was too tough, almost cardboard-esque, (some say they were made this way to prevent damage if they were dropped down a mine). But this is not the case for the pasties from Cornish Pasty Co. Here they are done well.

At Cornish Pasty Co they are light and tasty and the fillings were great. And oh, the choices! From the traditional Oggie to lamb or chicken or pork or cheese steak. There's even a tongue-in-cheek pasty which pays homage to Pulp Fiction. If you're a vegetarian, there aren't just a couple of choices, there is a whole page for you!

The beer list was extensive and varied, the patio wrapped around the whole building and the service was quick, attentive and engaging."}
{"text":"Wishing I didn't have to grab my food as carry out because I was really digging the grunge/garage door vibes of this business. 

My husband had one request for his Arizona birthday trip: must.eat.pasties. You got it, doll. 

So, I picked up some tasty treats via carry-out right before picking him up at the airport. They were able to turn around my phone call carry out order within 20 minutes. We opted for the cottage pie (which comes with a red wine gravy) and the caramel apple pie pasty which is served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. If we had more time, we would have chowed on our pasties at the bar along with a cold bebida. It was certainly happening during the Friday night time frame when I visited around 8pm. 

Super tasty, you guys. This is \"stick-to-your-ribs\" food at its finest. If you're new to the world of pasties (as I was), here's the full scoop: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty"}
{"text":"Flood is always good; don't want a pasty? Have one of the tasty salads. Oh and the have interesting craft beers. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time ATTEMPTING to trying this place with a group of 5. We walk in and we're told it's open seating. We find ourselves a seat and a server comes up and says one of the ovens is out so your food might take awhile. Ok no problem we say. Instead of a passing out menus or bringing out waters he never returns. Another server is busy trying to start a heater at a table that nobody is sitting at? Then walks right past us. I knew half the ovens weren't working but I didn't know half the servers \"checked out.\" After 20 minutes of waiting and not being acknowledged, we just decided to leave. Figure your shitty service out."}
{"text":"I believe this location is all self seating too... This location is better lit than the Tempe location for sure. I think it's more of a warm traditional vibe.

Our server was super friendly and helped my friends pick out pastys suited for their taste buds. I got the Pilgrim as I have before and it was great. 

Their food is definitely consistent between the two locations because I think they're handmade, frozen and then heated up later on...? Not 100% sure on that but I had heard that before.. 

Parking here by the way it's terrible. I would recommend taking an uber here, otherwise be prepared to walk."}
{"text":"Traditional English style pasties (Oggie - which I truly love). Quite a few choices - although Mexican and Italian style pasties aren't really traditional - but still great for choices with both Premium and Signature pasties. 
Good service. Wait staff attentive, courteous and quick. Always a winner when they are on the ball.
Good sides - the hand cut chips were delicious as well as the dipping sauces and vegetable dishes.
Good options for vegetarians who love a pastie also.
Definitely a place to stop by for a good feed. 
Nice choice of beers and wines, although somewhat slightly limited in my opinion.."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. I can't think of a reason not to eat here. I discovered this place back in 2010 and it has expanded steadily throughout the Phoenix area. This last particular outing was to Scottsdale and we sat outside under the heat lamps and had a great time with great food. The service was a little slow this time, but that would never stop me coming back here."}
{"text":"I was responsible for organizing a holiday dinner for my department of 50 people. I chose this delightful place to have it at due to consistent quality, ambience and helpful employees. I reached out to a manager to plan out everything and set it up very easily. I sent in a preorder and they were very accommodating with a food allergy offering the individual three options.

The day of event went great as well. The pasty's were delivered to everyone's expectations. People raved about the food for days after. In addition the banafee pie was a delight. This was a great experience, everyone was able to get the specific pasty they wanted and to have a great time at one of the best places in the state.

I have been to pasty a lot of other times I love the cream of leek soup!!! Everything I have had has been amazing.

Thanks Cornish pasty!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Came here today for the first time with my British mother in law. We both loved it. She had the Oggie and I had the Guinness Stew pasty. Both were yummy, but we both agreed the Guinness Stew was better. Friendly service topped it all off. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We had the Peppered Steak and the Chicken Tikka Pasties and the Tandoori wings. It was really good. The ambience is nice, we sat outdoors. We would like to repeat to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! Great service, great food, just eat here, you will not be disappointed. We went for lunch and called in our order ahead of time. We got there, sat down, and were served right away. If you are short on time, this is the way to go."}
{"text":"Seriously SUCH a gem of a restaurant.

Really relaxed vibe-- outdoor, indoor, bar seating. Not a place with anything fancy, which is funny for Scottsdale, but just down to earth really delicious food. 

Try the Thanksgiving dinner one. AMAZING."}
{"text":"Finally, I have completed my trio of visits of all the Cornish Patsy's in town!!  And guess what, yet another 5 star from me!!  I have to admit, I truly believe that Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite restaurants here in Phx, and just about everywhere else. We are so lucky to have a restaurant like this in the valley. Maybe with my support I can persuade them to come to the North West Valley.....please.lol

Ok each Cornish I have visited are have the same food, but total different vibe. The Tempe one is very dark and grungy. Black walls will do that. Mesa has almost a church feel, with a bit of French corder in it. Weird in their own ways. 

The Scottsdale location is made from 2 restored houses. A lot cleaner looking than the others yet has a lot of charm. The first thing I liked is how large the patio is. With connecting the two houses it's like 1 giant patio with a wrap around porch. We came on a perfect spring night and sat outside. 

Service was great..for the food I had the Cajan chicken, wife had the Mexican, friend had peppered steak. We liked them all, but the least liked was the Mexican, probably wouldn't order that one again. My ultimate favorite pasty is the Meat and Cheese. In fact my friend from Austin that came in to see me wants to go back here on way to the airport and I'm already craving what I'm going to order!! Ha

Oh if no one knows what pasty's are, they are basically a hot pocket on steroids! But made with all natural and fresh ingredients and a flakey crust. Amazing. That all I have left to say."}
{"text":"My go to spot in Old Town - there's nothing else like it. I always stick with the peppered beef pasty but I get the Red Wine gravy instead of the peppercorn gravy. SO GOOD"}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere of this place is bad ass! The bar area is really cool in that its meant to look like a genuine English pub. We sat at the bar and ordered the chicken pot pie pasty (yes I know it was a safe choice, but sometimes you have to when at a new to you place) and fiance had the lamb curry pasty - there was a different name for it but that's how I remember it. Anyway, my pasty was good and fiance liked his. I wasn't a fan of his as something about it made it too sweet for my liking. They are big portions so when we go back, it would be fun to split one and get a couple of the sides to share as well. We had the mushy peas which were yummy as well. It was a bummer because 2 of the 3 things we originally ordered were 86'd so we had to go with option B.

I would definitely come back here to hang in the bar and grab a snack but its not a dinner place in my mind."}
{"text":"I really like this location.  As a long-time, Old Town resident, I love supporting all of our local restaurants & bars.  

The staff was really nice, overly nice actually.  Kind of strange, but I'll take it. 

The food was pretty good.  I'm not a pasty guy, but I can't complain about it since I decided to dine at a place which specializes in pasties.  That's on me.  

The only con is that this place seems like a hipster hangout.  Each time I've been, I've noticed quite a bit of those annoying types.  They can ruin any environment.    

But overall, I like this place."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Old Town Scottsdale.  Best meat pies in the Valley and the service is usually outstanding.  Excellent salads for those watching their weight.  Fine craft beer selection.  The building itself is perfect!  It would be a 5 star review, but I'm picky about the background music.  Too much Black Sabbath, Foreigner, and Boston played last night.  How about some indie rock, jazz, or classic soul to give the place the classy sounds it deserves.  The food, service, beer, and architecture/decor are A+."}
{"text":"Pot pies everywhere! So many yummy choices it's hard to have just one. Maybe take a few friends and share? 
Parking is easy, service is great, the outdoor area is surprisingly peaceful for the location. I even saw other families enjoying a quiet meal, but my toddler wasn't down, so this will be an adults only spot for our family."}
{"text":"My son loves this place. He had Been ranting about this place for quite awhile so I decided to try it out.   He was right the food was delicious. I had the veggie pasty. It was delicious not too salty. The veggies were abundant and cooked just right. The crust stayed nice and flaky not soggy at all.  The dipping sauce was a nice compliment to the pasty. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the shepards pie pastry and it was good. I knocked down a star because my old fashion drink was not legit. If actually looked watered down (I didn't want to complain because the girl was young & it was busy) also I think because it's more of a beer bar then a liquor bar. It did the job. Alcohol is alcohol and works the same but I do love me a legit old fashion. Husband was not too impressed with his portebello chicken pie pastry but I liked mine!!! The fries were taking about 1hr... the server gave us a unexpected discount because we waited so long so that was kind of him. 

It gets busy! We sat at the bar. The guy up in front who helped us signed in for our table was pretty nice. We sat at the bar and asked for a table in case we couldn't get food at the bar. Prob about 45 mins later, he actually came back looking for us, asking if we wanted our spot still. 

If you are a pie person and want a hearty comfort piece of crusted pie pastry, come here and try it. There were so many options! Next time, I'll come for a beer or wine instead."}
{"text":"All I have to say is I went there 3 times in 1 week.  The chicken tikka masala was exceptional.  The service isn't always the greatest but the food makes up for it.  Go here and thank me later."}
{"text":"We went there on a Rainy evening.So we were first seated at the Bar were we enjoyed a few Beers (they also have a great selection of wines) and i tried the Cornwall Nash its a gin based cocktail.I would love if they had a wider selection of in house cocktails however it tasted Fine considering i'm not really big on Gin.

They have a wonderful outdoor seating but the rains dragged us inside,the interiors were nice and quaint.We rather enjoyed our Scotch Eggs with a Spicy Mustard Dip followed by the Pasty Chicken tikka masala and Rosemary chicken both were served with dips i'm not too sure what they were and nobody told me so yeah!

Anyways they were freshly baked and flavorful,it was a pleasant surprise that they got the tikka masala spot on with potatoes and green peppers.The Rosemary was crisp with roasted red peppers,potatoes and Brie.
Other interesting items were the vegetarian chicken pasties i shall be on the look out for those in my next visit."}
{"text":"After seeing this place as a stop on a food tour I was considering, I decided to stop in and try one of their pasties. With help from the waitress in choosing from their vast menu, I decided on a traditional lamb and potato one. It was great and I'd be interested to try some of their other many varieties."}
{"text":"Service was great. No mistakes and timely. Everyone other than Myself loved the food. Just not my food type I guess. With that said they have a wonderful beer selection. The blood orange ale was super yummy. The bar and patio have plenty of room. Very easily accommodate large groups.    
Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Hands down the #1 Cornish Pasty in Phoenix! I've eaten here several times because I love that you can look right out onto Mill Ave. and people watch while you grub on massive salads, grubby wings and super filling Pasty goodness! The beer and wine selections are perfect for Pasty pairings, but, if you aren't sure what you should have, the staff is a band of rockstars who know their sh** and can recommend something fun! A friendly, funny and engaging group even when they are slammed with patrons in this popular little corner of Mill Ave. GO THERE!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I really do (I'm giving it four star after all). However, I wasn't as blown away by it as a lot of others seem to be. My friends used to tell me about going to the Tempe location all the time & how much they LOVED the pasties.

I mean, the restaurant itself is really nice. I liked the set-up/atmosphere. It has a \"clean\" pub feel to it if that makes any sense. I really like the wood tables. The patio is really nice (that's where my and my dining companion sat for lunch). The bar area looked really nice as well, and from what I can tell they had several beers on tap. Service was fine on our visit. 

The pasties were definitely tasty. I had the Italian, and I guess when you're eating something that's similar to a calzone anyway you look at it, and you get the one that's MOST similar to a calzone it's a little difficult to get a sense of how unique pasties really are. They have several interesting options, many of which I'd really like to try in the future. My dining companion and I also split an order of fries. I thought they were good, but a little crispy. I like my fries on the crispy side, but a good portion of them were almost a little TOO crispy. We couldn't tell if that's why they were going for or not.  My friend really liked her hibiscus ice tea. She's been here a few times and said all their ice teas are really good. 
 
I'd certainly come back to Cornish Pasty Co., and it seems like a fun place for a large group to grab a meal. Like I said though, I guess I'm just not totally enamored by pasties (but they are good)."}
{"text":"I love this place in Tempe, but had a very bad experience at the one in Scottsdale! We were a group of six for lunch on Saturday. One guy in our group had water spilled on his phone from waitress, another person received wrong food and the waitress said the kitchen forgot my order. It was an average crowd, but waitress said it was extremely busy, what will they do when snow birds & Spring Training arrives?! The worst part was about 8pm when I was hugging the toilet puking my brains out. I can only guess it was food poisoning. My guess is they rushed my order and didn't cook it long enough."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law and I went to Cornish Pasty for their reverse happy hour. She had a mueller (?) cider and I had some kind of IPA. The IPA was fruity and flowery, and I surprisingly enjoyed it! It's not the type of beer I usually go to, but it worked. She ordered the Thanksgiving Pasty and I went with the Portobello Pasty. WOW. The pasties were flaky but crispy and full of perfect flavor! I've never had a pasty before so I don't haven anything to compare to, but this was so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A hidden gem! I love their garden salads with lots of fresh veggies and the salmon with asparagus pasty was amazing! The bartender was so nice and personable! My husband and I plan to go there again today because the food was so good! You have to try!"}
{"text":"This Cornish Pasty is more spacious than the Mesa and University Dr. locations I've been to and has a really nice dog friendly patio. There is a dedicated parking lot but has limited spaces but there is nearby street parking close to the restaurant. Despite being on Goldwater the signage isn't very noticeable so it can be a little hard to find. I didn't immediately see the restaurant but luckily turned into the closest side street for parking.

We stepped in for dinner around 7-7:30 on a weekday and there were plenty of seats to choose from both inside and outside. We sat on the patio and enjoyed our delicious pasties. I had the salmon pasty which had tender flaky fish, spinach, and potato with a lovely white wine sauce that went well with it. The buttery crust was excellent. I tried a bit of the Reuben as well which had well seasoned, tender corned beef, sauerkraut, with a small container of Thousand Island dressing to go with it.

Service was good. Our server was friendly and attentive.

I'll be back if I'm craving a delicious pasty next time I'm in the area!

4.5/5"}
{"text":"I have always loved Cornish Pasty! It was such a fun surprise to stumble upon their newest \"hole-in-the-wall\" location late night! I love walking and running on Mill Ave. during the night to experience the culture and music! 

It was great to see that there is a new late night food spot on Mill. The food was amazing and super heartwarming. I loved the soda bread that came with my soup! If you're a bread and butter type of person you have to try this place! 

Our server, Christina, was very kind and knowledgable about the menu. Love the atmosphere, it's super comfortable and clean.

Leaving happy and full!  xx"}
{"text":"Great to get an authentic tasting pasty (an ex-Brit commenting here). Service was really friendly and efficient. We even got to discuss our experiwnce with the mgr/owner. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Great pasty. Just tried the Oggie so far but just like I remember as a little girl in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Got the Pilgrim, shepherds pie, and a chicken mushroom one with peppers in the fridge. Love that you can get them to heat up in the oven. Crust is flakey perfection. Will definitely try the Cornish Pasty Co again."}
{"text":"We all liked this place and had a bit of nostalgia to road trips in Northern Michigan"}
{"text":"Just left this cute little place and we are obsessed! We got sat right away and pretty much got to pick wherever. There is a cute patio out front where you can sit as well, but we decided on a bit comfy booth inside right by the kitchen. Oh my god the smells in the kitchen... every two minutes it would change from a buttery cheese smell to a meatier veggie smell it was insane. We ordered the tiki salad which I loved and my hubby ordered the Shepard's pie pasty both were so delicious. The device was so great and the prices were pretty reasonable. Will totally be back.. if you haven't gone you have to check this place out"}
{"text":"Got an order to go. I got the bangers and mash pasty. It was very potato dense, 2/3 potatoes and 1/3 meat and onion.  the bangers were  moist and flavorful, but the potatoes were bland and needed the gravy to get through it. The pastry was light and flakey. Overall it was good, but I would try a different one next time. 

The chips were kind of gross. I was told the garlic was good, but nothing like traditional garlic fries. It smelt heavily of garlic but had zero garlic taste. Would recommend a different side. Maybe the English like bland potatoes all around."}
{"text":"As a carb lover, anything wrapped in a pastry is pretty exciting for me. Cornish Pasty serves mainly pasties and they have a few dozen different fillings and dipping sauces to choose from. 

The first time I ever ate here, I ordered the eggplant parmesan pasty. Because I loooove eggplant Parmesan any other time. But in pasty form, not so great. Plus they put broccoli in it. But I still saw the potential there. I also tried a bite of my friend's Cajun chicken pasty, which comes with a really awesome spicy sauce, and I liked it. So I figured I just ordered the wrong pasty for me. I came back a second time and ordered the bangers and mash pasty--much better! I think pasties were originally intended to be a meat and potatoes thing, and I think it's best to stick to that.

I gave it 3 stars because the service both times I've been there has been sub par. The waitresses always seem to forget about our table for long stretches of time. They also don't allow you to modify anything in a pasty. I believe this is because they ship them over frozen and are just heated up. Naturally, I would give them more brownie points for making the pasties fresh on site."}
{"text":"Love the pasty's here. The whole group was very satisfied with every selection. From the traditional choices to the vindaloo and Royale with cheese. The only issue I had was each of the three beers I ordered they were out of. It got to be almost comical and I eventually had a Guinness which is always good but not what I was originally in the mood for. We probably would have stayed for another round but apparently supplies were short."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since finding the Tempe store. Watched the build out in Scottsdale with much anticipation. Service has always been good, great beer list, great prices, and a amazing patio."}
{"text":"The best! If in in Tempe it's on the mind . Dark lighting the beer and the crazy people swee"}
{"text":"We love this place! We stop by here at least once a week. They have great food and awesome service. Brianna is THE BEST server/bartender ever!!  We love her and we always sit in her section or at the bar depending on where she is working. For great atmosphere and a really nice meal, you've gotta check out Cornish Pasty in Old Town."}
{"text":"Very consistent. These pasty's are sooooo good. Consider it a huge homemade hot pocket made out of puff pastry, like a puff pastry calzone that is buttery and flaky.  38 different kind! You won't be disappointed. Service is good."}
{"text":"Omg....  I thought the chicken pot pie pasty was amazing..... Then I had the Banofee Pie!!!! Heaven on a plate!!!"}
{"text":"Love Cornish Pasty! This was my first time at the Mill Ave location, I've usually only been to the Scottsdale one. This Cornish was a bit smaller, but still with indoor and outdoor seating. Lots of bar sitting/stools. It's a fun location to sit and eat on Mill. The Shepherd's Pie is my current favorite, and it was just as delicious here as their other location. I also love how many vegetarian pastys they make! They have a whole separate menu of some of the classic pastys, just vegetarian. Also, I love their bread. :) Perfectly flaky and warm!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Cornish Pasty Co. and when I was back in Phoenix for Homecoming, we had a big group dinner at the Scottsdale location which I had never been to. It was a late dinner, so we more or less had the place to ourselves and sat out on the patio with the heater on. I'm not sure if all locations have expanded their menu or if it is just this one, but my friend and I shared the (constitution?) wings and a pasty. The quality was great as expected and our server handled our party great. Would definitely return and recommend"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4.5/5
Happiness - 3/5

I was really blown away by this place. Though I adore English/Irish/Scottish beers (i.e., Boddingtons, Guiness, Harp), I have always dreaded going to a pub hungry because the food is usually uninspired. But Cornish Pastry Co. shows that the UK can deliver some good food too. 

I started with the red pepper soup, which was phenomenal. It came with some house-made bread and great soft butter. I could have easily just eaten bowls of the soup and an entire loaf of the bread. Pasties are kind of like a pot-pie mixed with a hot pocket, but far more high quality. The dough was a bit thick for my liking, but I'm not a big pot pie person, so if you enjoy savory pies, I'm sure you'll love it more than I did. The only complaint - it will take a very long time for them to special order any of the pasties (i.e., I don't like melted cheese, and almost all the pasties come with it). So you will want to check out the menu online first to make sure there are a few options you like. I went with a salmon-based pastie that had a nice dill sauce instead of cheese. 

The location is nice, with a gorgeous outside bar. But it is hard to find (I walked around for about 5 minutes through the labyrinth of nearby restaurants and cafes before finding it). Also, VERY minimal parking. They name mixed drinks after Star Wars characters, which is a nice touch. The bartender was friendly, but not too terribly attentive."}
{"text":"Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.  

The main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1

The second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.  

The crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo. 

Give it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great setting and ambience. Original and quality drinks.  Pastry was more than filling. I'm a big guy and shared one with my girlfriend. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had to try to the pasties when in town. It was my second time in Tempe for a conference and all the attendees were talking about the pasties. I had a chicken pesto and my daughter had a vegetarian option with a \"chicken\" substitute product. She thought the chicken was pretty good. They are very filling. We also ordered fries which were outrageously good - crispy and fresh out of the fryer. Paired well with a cold beer. If you are looking for a casual lunch, this is definitely a good choice. And the price is right."}
{"text":"I had the meatball pasty and my friend had the traditional pasty.  Both were very tasty.  The red lights in the bar area is different.  Everyone looks better in red lights.  We did not know that there is a bar side - counter service and a restaurant - full service side.  

We sat down and no one came by so we walked to the bar and ordered.  The bartender was defensive about the bar and restaurant.  He did soften up and gave us recommendations as my friend pronounced pasty correctly.

The pasty were very good and we can see they made a lot of them with all the pastry racks they have in the semi open kitchen.

Sorry no pics. Hungry after a long day of work and only my 2nd day in Phoenix.  Also the bar was pretty dark."}
{"text":"This new one is soooo much nicer than the Tempe location. Food is awesome! We usually get different pasty's when we go, but my absolute favorite is the Royal with Cheese. Yummy!!!!!

The atmosphere at this location is bar none! Open & airy. An array of seating types to choose from, indoors & out. Beer selection is great, cocktails are good. Just wish they would carry Sapphire Bombay Gin, come on people, it's English Gin after all!!!!

This is my go to restaurant when company comes to visit. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice find on a trip to Scottsdale. First time trying a pasty--had the shepherd's pie (tasty); wanted the lamb and mint but they were out. Was with someone born in Cornwall who attested to the authenticity. (He enjoyed the Oggie.). A small bit oh greens / salad would have been a nice accompaniment (if not authentic). Ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Have been to Cornish many times between the Mesa, Tempe and Scottsdale location and all I have to say is that this place is all types of mouth sex. 

The bottle and draft selection is always exciting. I have neglected to try anything from the cocktail list yet but that does not mean I am not avoiding it by any means! The food is amazing and alike I'm sure the cocktails are too!
 
A few favorites:
Curried potatoes... amazing
The Pilgram... omg your saying i can have thanksgiving whenever I want??
The Lamb Vindaloo... prepare for some heavy breathing from the heat. so. worth. it.

The layout of this place is very comfortable. Along with what I call comfort food the staff and the environment really pulls it together.

A must to visit if your a new resident to PHX, traveling through or you just live here. I promise it wont be your last time back."}
{"text":"Thank you for a free dinner but so in shock over what we saw. This is a family restaurant, I have been coming here for years. Management should have kicked out those nasty people. You do not allow a drunk woman to pull her top and pants down. Not only once but several times. Disgusted! Disappointed in management. We had to leave early and not enjoy our drinks and dessert because of those obnoxious people. They should have been kicked out. This is a restaurant not a strip club."}
{"text":"Excellent. Food. Excellent value.  Great customer service.  Portions are easily shared and you will walk out full.  Really good"}
{"text":"God this place is just so unfairly good.  You honestly cant go wrong with anything on the menu. I'm at that point where i just sit down and tell the server to surprise me with a pasty and a beer that goes with it and it's good every. freaking. time.

Also worth noting, I've put on some interesting events here and they've ALWAYS worked with me.  The entire staff from the top down rocks."}
{"text":"Wow!!  This is my new favorite place in Old Town!  My boyfriend has been there a few times and took me yesterday.  First of all, they have a fantastic patio, which was a wonderful spot to spend a 70-degree, sunny Sunday.  I couldn't believe how packed the patio was at 3:30, but it was almost full.  There's also ample seating inside, which I will need in the throes of the Arizona summer.  Second, their drinks are relatively inexpensive and strong, and happy hour lasts all day on Sundays.  Third, the pasties are DELICIOUS!  My bf has tried a couple but has stuck with the Reuben because he thinks it's the best.  We ordered a Reuben and a cottage pie (like Shepherd's pie, but with beef and not lamb).  They were both amazing, but the Reuben was definitely my favorite.  The dough was cooked perfectly, the meat was in thick, tasty chunks, and the thousand island was very flavorful.  I usually order apps when I'm out to eat, but there's no way I could have at this place.  The pasties are big!  I barely ate half of each half that I had.  My only complaint is that there are too many different types to choose from!  How will I ever try them all?!  I will definitely be back soon and often, now that I have been introduced to this neighborhood gem :)"}
{"text":"YUM!

Okay let me first begin by saying I was visiting from out of town and friends brought me here for dinner.  What a cool vibe, so trendy and fun.  I wish Cornish Pasty Co. came to Southern California (just sayin!)  

I ordered a pasty of course because that's what you do.  I ordered the Shepard's pie pasty with beef.  They also make the cottage pie with lamb, same ingredients.  Honestly it tasted like lamb which I don't like the taste of and I had to send it back to the kitchen.  They didn't argue but offered me another dish on the menu.   I decided to get their Red Pepper, Black Bean, Rice, Chicken, Jalapeno soup with their amazing homemade soda bread and butter.  Honestly it was amazing.  I am still dreaming of that dish and probably could eat it for days.  

I gave them five stars because they have a great ambiance, the service was great (friendly) and while the food is fresh and yummy they took care of my little issue politely and made it easy for me to change.

I'll be back unless you open a restaurant in So. Cal!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, really really good.  Dessert is better.  Bread served with soup is good, as is the soup.

Problem?   Too loud.   Inside is hard surfaces etc then they play 70's rock too loud, which makes people talk even louder, which makes them turn up the music.  They seem to want to copy the ambiance of \"five guys\".   I can see Saturday or Friday late, but Monday 4PM?   

The food is great because it is made old fashioned way.  The atmosphere is old fashioned.   My question is, after Cornish miners worked all day in mines with loud mining machinery did they listen to loud music?

Some places like \"Johny Rockets\" are loud but have patio to get away from noise.   But this place has speakers on patio too.   Not as loud - we went out on patio, better to deal with flies than the louder noise inside."}
{"text":"We love this place!  My husband grew up in Northern Michigan, the U.P. to be exact, and they eat a lot of pasties.  I had no clue what they were until I visited his hometown and was hooked.  They are great and the pasties that are served at the Cornish Pasty Company are spot on!"}
{"text":"No need to hop the pond any longer when you get the urge for some British grub. This is the real deal right here in Scottsdale, just as good as the ones that I have eaten in England. 

The menu has several prime choices, the traditional Cornish Pasty and some unique ones, including the Pilgrim that is served up with cranberry sauce. That's right, I was tasting Thanksgiving dinner all wrapped up in a golden crust. 

The interior of the restaurant definitely has that British pub feel and look, and the long communal tables are trendy and at the same time, reminiscent of the old days.

The wide selection of drinks and pasties will keep you coming back to try a different pasty or a different drink.

Brilliant location and food!"}
{"text":"Incredible meat pies! Very authentic English if you like English food. I visited here on my trip to Phoenix. I was very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great afternoon atmosphere. Great beer selection. And awesome Pasties! Like 30 pasty options."}
{"text":"Wow! Great place. Love the menu and how different this place is to other restaurants. The atmosphere is very down to earth. Food is great. Will be back and will recommend."}
{"text":"If I was just grading the food I would give five plus stars. I had the chicken red curry pasty and it was divine. I went alone and sat at the bar where you can pleasantly enjoy watching the staff make the pastys. Bonus points here. Bonus points until I see one young man with a bit too much facial hair and not enough hair net take a taste of what he was making and go right back to it without washing his hands.  also while my server was pleasant, the wait times between seating myself/menus/beer arriving and finally my supper were really too long. Overal however it was a pleasant experience and the mood of the place is well done."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty on mill ave is smaller than its other locations but perfect for a quick drink or get together meal with some cool friends. It's on the corner next to Palettas Betty and right across from the Starbucks. It has a divey dive bar feel which is good, for its aesthetic because of the food and the drinks. Food are drinks here are really cheap and delicious so it doesn't have a happy hour which is understandable. Maybe if they had daily specials that would be great? But other than that you seat yourself, service was really good and attentive she was amazing and outgoing! I ordered the Mac & cheese pasty (9) which was pretty good match it with the chipotle sauce even better. Tried the bulliet whisky cocktail (8) that www refreshing too, and the drafts are really good mostly local taps. So if you have been to other locations you know what you're getting into I definitely recommend this place for a quick bite to eat or drinks! Okay Phoenix stay hungry and cool!"}
{"text":"Cornish pasty was a staple of my college days with always a wonderful selection of beer on tap and the most phenomenal pasties west of the Atlantic! This location has a wonderful patio, excellent staff (shout out to my man, Chris) and literally no one bothered us, so what more could you want??

Tonight I had their all day English breakfast pasty. It just really hit the spot after a long drive from LA. 

Beans, poached egg, bacon, potatoes and baked tomatoes fill a flakey, lightly salted crust. I ordered it with ranch and their magical chipotle sauce. I love just how many sauces Cornish has. Truly a beautiful thing. 

I've very much missed this spot  please open an LA location !!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last Saturday. We were surprized to get seated right away. Place was busy. Lots of tables and they have a great outdoor area. Bar is outside and with large counter. Looked like everyone was having a great time but we ate inside, too hot.
Love the tin menus, great selection of imported beers on draft. Pricing was reasonable as well. I got the Hefe and it was great. Food was great and a decent value. We had to wait a while for our dessert but I guess they bake it. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. The Tandori wings were so different and a winner in my book but the Pasties were absolutely incredible!!!! The pepper steak was served with a mouth watering gravy. I LOVED the atmosphere and the bartenders happily guided us through our first dining experience. Can NOT wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll go for the 4 stars for their ambience, service and there ain't any British pub similar to cornish pasty in the area for comparison. The good part it is open till late and you've the option to be seated outside which is great ! Lot of vegetarian options"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here!  We sat at the bar and chatted with our good friends and the wait staff was prompt and courteous.  They have a good beer list too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"These are delicious! What's not to love about stuffed puffed pastry?! 

The environment is inviting, and it's fun to watch them make the pasties. You can get whatever you want in your pasty, and every bite melts in your mouth! 

A must eat."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant, and one of my favorite location from all the other Cornish in the valley. Cornish has amazing quality, and decllicious food for a price that I consider low cost compare to how amazing and unique the food is. Cornish is definitely a place you'll want to take your date to, especially in the Tempe location, where it has a romantic setting.

Overall: Defintely a recommended restaurant that people need to try."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The space itself is really pleasant, with a lot of outside deck area and a good-sized indoor/outdoor bar. The service is always phenomenal - friendly, smart, and on the ball.  The food - unique and very satisfying.  There is probably something here for nearly everyone.  It is just a really comfortable, happy place to be.  Even the desserts are pretty darn yummy.  My favorite thing is to sit on the patio, on lovely AZ afternoon, stuffing my face, and enjoying the scenery."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in Old Town.  I highly recommend it for a place to unwind with drinks and small plates.  There is plenty of space indoors and outdoors.  

I ordered the chicken pot pie pasty, and it was great.  It wasn't that big either, but it was still filling.  My guest ordered the spicy asiago chicken pasty which is vegetarian, and she loved it.  They actually have a great selection of vegetarian options.

I lucked out and found parking on the neighborhood street on the south side of the club.  I think there are some small parking lots, but parking seems tight (a common theme of Old Town at times).  Regardless, I enjoyed it, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"The chicken liver pate was fantastic!! They give you an overabundance and are more than kind to give additional bread when you devour it. 

We stopped in for drinks after a game and it was a fantastic experience. The beer selection was great and the ambiance was one of the best in Scottsdale. Get their early to get an outdoor seat on the bar. 

They have a great happy hour and drink specials."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and a cuisine you don't see many places.

All the pasties (sp?) were great.
Bacon-wrapped meatballs? Awesome.
Nice patio on a warm night and friendly service,
Good beer selection, too.

This was one of our favorite meals in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My bf and I came here on a Saturday night date and we were entertained the whole time! We sat at the kitchen bar so we could see all the action in the kitchen. Chefs and wait staff were tentative to our requests. Also the owners were present and cheerful. Bf ordered the Mexican patsy and I ordered the peppered steak patsy. Bf and I determined the peppered steak was the winner. We also started with appetizers. Bean dip served as a cold dish and the Scottish Egg which was surprisingly delicious! I'd recommend this place for amusement and a great meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have only been to the Tempe location and loved the food there, but was looking for a more \"upscale\" atmosphere to take my parents to when they were in town.  This place was perfect. The patio seating was beautiful. It had nice shade from trees and other patio overhangs and the servers didn't forget you when you sit outside. The inside was just as nice too, but a little bit more noisy. The food here was just as impressive as the other locations. I got the leek soup and The Greek pasty and they were so good. I would also recommend their iced teas! They have some pretty great flavors as opposed to just the traditional iced tea. 

Great service, great atmosphere, and great prices. Can't beat this place."}
{"text":"If you like good comfort food, and old traditional English comfort this is the place to come for dinner. Pasties are a unique English dinner item that must be tried.
 
Amazing atmosphere, I absolutely love this old home turned into restaurant. The second you get here from the courtyard patio seating to the inside seating, you feel like you're in an English pub, and comfortable.

The staff, and this is important to me; knows the menu, provide excellent recommendations and know how and when to check in on you throughout your meal.

This is only my 2nd visit, but it most certainly won't be my last! Love this place."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite bar/restaurant in the city! Very kind of staff, delicious affordable food. Great beer selection - wonderful atmosphere... I almost hesitated to write this review because I want to keep this hidden gem to myself but that wouldn't be fair to whoever's worked so hard to create this joint! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Place is really relaxing and food is amazing. Very flavorful and different."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just get a hankering for pub food that's hearty and sticks to your ribs. Came in for lunch with the bf before shopping and he was a fan of the Tempe location. 

The place was almost entirely empty, but lovely looking. Not as dark nor dingy as Tempe's location. We started off with a Scotch Egg to share and got each ordered a pasty. I wanted to go with a simple cottage pie and the bf got the Guinness Beef Stew. 

The Scotch Egg is definitely on the small side, it being one hard boiled egg encased in a seasoned sausage meat and deep fried. It was served with dipping sauce on the side. Pretty good flavor and tasted good with the honey mustard sauce. 

My Cottage Pie pasty was definitely filling, I always love the crust here! It's flakey, soft but substantial enough to hold the contents in. Typical ingredients of ground beef, mashed potatoes, carrots and served along with a red wine reduction type sauce. 

The Guinness Beef Stew was good, tender pieces of beef and you can really taste the Guinness. The sour cream and chive sauce served along with it freshened up the richness of the pasty and provided a good contrast of cool cream to hot stew filling. The only con was there wasn't much depth or complexity to this filling, it tasted mostly of Guinness leaving me wanting to taste the flavors of herbs that had stewed along with the meat.

Service was great, we were checked up on frequently and food came out promptly. Location is nice with a small parking lot and is easily accessible. The place wasn't too dim and wasn't too noisy as it was practically empty."}
{"text":"The place is very casual but the food is a bit more serious. Love to go with my daughter---we always share a Pilgrim and a Chicken Pot Pie....yum-o.  The service is always personable and unobtrusive."}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with Cornish Pasty! i recently visited the Scottsdale location after discovering that it was there! I have been to every other location and always am super satisfied! This location help up to my standards! Helpful and friendly staff and as always, amazing food! Love it!"}
{"text":"Okay - I'm a huge fan of Cornish. I originally went to the Tempe one and had a bad experience but the vibe at this Cornish is much different. 

To start the meatballs are excellent and the \"chips\" are a great addition to any meal. Also, the tomato soup is an amazing starter or a light meal. 

I've had the Italian, Philly, and Piligram Cornish and felt different about each one. The philly was a bust because I hate onion and you can't substitute on any Cornish. The piligram was decent but I think I was to excited for it and then was a bit let down. The ITALIAN is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty has about any combination of pasty you want, and if you have allergies, call ahead and they can prepare you something different! How's that for customer service!!! They are simply delicious with a huge craft beer offering. Their dessert pasty's are fantastic as well. It's a huge place, so you can sit inside, or outside on the patio, which is great for this time of year. Can't miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"Think of the pasties as an English version of the calzone or empanada. A stuffed, folded dough pastry filled with savory ingredients. Cornish offers a variety of combinations from the traditional meat and potatoes (chicken pot pie is one of my favorites) to the ethnic (Cajun chicken). One is enough plenty for one person! They also come cut so it's good to swap halves with friends to try different ones."}
{"text":"The Cornish pasty that I had here (with shepherds pie filling) was a thing of beauty, a joy forever, reminded me of and at the same time was superior to the ones I used to eat as an Oxford undergraduate. Plus friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome I found on yelp and I had to try it while I was visiting. The service is amazing our waitress was Ashley and she was very thoughtful and nice. They are known for there pasty which my sister got and she said it amazing. My mom and I got salads which were made by Trevor and those were awesome as well. One of the best salads I have had and they are definitely not stingy on the meat. Recommend this place to anyone and everyone. It's also super cute as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love their Italian pastie it's my favorite. The atmosphere is great and everyone Is very friendly! This is our go
To spot on cheat days and have never been disappointed  :)!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. My wife and I split a Scotch Yoke appetizer before diving into our own Pasties; she had the Pilgrim (full of Thanksgiving faves) and I devoured the Cajun Chicken. Both were delicious and left us wanting more. We finished with the Chocolate Bread Pudding desert with ice cream (listed at bottom of desert menu) and it was amazing; a nice toasty cake of sorts that paired brilliantly with the vanilla flavored ice cream."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch and what a treat it was.   The tradional pasty is a great meal all by itself.   The building is an old home that has been converted and there is a very nice patio where you can sit and watch the world drive by.  It all makes for another great restaurant experince in Scottsdale.   Try it out before they start advertising and the rest of the world finds it."}
{"text":"I'm overdue in writing this review. We attended a wedding in town and stopped here the day we arrived. The ambiance is dark and comfortable-this is a place you can enjoy a hearty meal with friends and leave feeling full and satisfied. We tried a variety of pasties and every single one was made fresh, served piping hot perfection. Please open one in Chicago!"}
{"text":"This place serves the best Pastries in greater Phoenix area. There desserts are must try ones."}
{"text":"Slap my face with a flavor explosion!!!!!!!!!!! This place is sooo good. Also the drinks are good to."}
{"text":"We had the lamb vindaloo pasty and a vegetarian potato pasty. The latter was not flavorful. Vindaloo pasty was at least flavorful but not authentic with a red sauce that seemed like it was borrowed from the tikka pasty and more potatoes than lamb. The pastry shell itself was good though. 

This was an ok spot. Its strongest feature is its affordability in the downtown area. Service was spotty and slow."}
{"text":"Small little place but we were able to find a seat immediately which was nice. The vibe is really cool and the music is good! Unfortunately, their menu is so limited to me because I don't eat dairy and I'd say that at least 90% of the menu items have cheese and the pasties are pre-made and not customizable. I was pleasantly surprised to see \"vegan options\" on the back of the menu though!

When I asked about the options, the waitress listed off 3 kinds but didn't really know much about what was in them. When I ordered the one that sounded the best, she came back and told me that they actually only had one of those original 3 options, so I really didn't have much of a choice after all. 

It ended up being the vegan version of the Roast Beef Sarnie, which sounded pretty good but wasn't all that great. The \"Roast Beef\" had a slippery mushroom texture to it and the pasty was smothered with vegan cheese. I normally don't mind vegan cheese but too much of it can be pretty off-putting. The pasty crust was delicious though and tasted a lot like a pot pie crust! It was a good size dish and if the ingredients were more enjoyable, I would have definitely considered it satisfying. 

I understand that my review is a bit skewed because of my restrictions and I think if I could eat dairy, I would have been a lot happier with the meal. What actually made me bump the stars down was the waitress who was really unprepared. First she had no clue what ingredients were in the vegan options, then she had to rescind her offer after I made my first choice. If a restaurant is going to offer alternative options, I think the staff should be equally knowledgeable on those items too. 

I probably won't go back but I might recommend it to my dairy-eating friends!"}
{"text":"Friendly and casual, very \" pub like\", bench seating, inside and out, staff is courteous and amicable. Service is prompt but not rushed, waitress explained menu items- she knew her stuff. Pasty dishes (not pastry) are unique, varied and very tasty. The menu has a brief entry on the history of the pasty. Sort of like a Calzone, but a light and flakey crust and a large selection of fillings. I had the chicken pesto w/ artichoke - very good! Give it a go- you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty is awesome.  I have never been disappointed here.... but after my first few visits, I don't stray from the Pilgrim... not because I don't like the others, but because I love Thanksgiving that much!  I have visited this location at least 3 times even though I hate parking in Scottsdale, but it has been surprisingly pain free to park on the street.  This location has a lot of seating and a good patio area."}
{"text":"Order through post mates and food is YUMMY! Second time ordering it and I got something new and loved everything. It's consistently good! It's like a soft croissant sandwich. :) highly recommend take out service. Have yet to dine in, that soon will be changing."}
{"text":"My first time in a Cornish Pasty company restaurant was in Tempe, Arizona. So when they opened a Scottsdale location closer to my house I couldn't wait to try them again.  I'm a midwestern raised kind of girl who's developed a pretty complicated palate since moving to AZ.   I can appreciate a meal that sticks to your ribs.  It's heavy yet so satisfyingly good.  Choose your filling... steak, chicken, veggies and their amazing combinations of sauces and cheeses.  The Royale with Cheese was my first pasty experience with garlic and herb red potatoes.  It was love at first bite!!  

I like the location of this restaurant right on Goldwater... beautiful open air design.  The moscow mules are delicious.  A recent try was the Scottish eggs!!!  TRY them!  The mustard dipping sauce is perfect. The staff is always polite and very attentive.  Doesn't matter if you are on the patio or seated inside they are present and happy to serve you."}
{"text":"When you want to change up your routine Dinner to something fun and hearty. Choose this place, great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"So good! I dated this psycho vegan chick for a few months last year and she loves this place! I'm all about the chicken pot pie and Guinness stew, but she says the four or so vegan pasties are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it was one location and one hallway. Love the pasties, the vibe, and the staff."}
{"text":"Love everything on the menu, you can't go wrong no matter what you pick. The different sauces that come with the meal is so delish! One of my favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"1 pasty was very good (Rueben) and 1 pasty was not good at all (carne Adovada) - best way to describe this place is they serve super tasty adult hot pockets. Good beer selection and nice patio!"}
{"text":"The draft German beer selection here is the best beer I've ever had, and the service was great-- our food arrived fast and the cheese and onion pasty I ordered was like... \"wow\" tier.  Actually wow.  I tried some of my friends' pasties and they were all really good and came with these sauces that are specific to the pasty.

Definitely should visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I suppose that I am a little biased because I have loved Cornish pasties forever!
I grew up eating them in England and have loved their taste since I bit into my first one.
Was I a little cautious when deciding to eat here? Absolutely not.
Having read some of the yelp reviews, I was pretty certain that the food here was going to be awesome. I was not disappointed!
I ordered the Oggie, a traditional pasty and it tasted exactly as it should have tasted. It was a real Cornish pasty. I was in food heaven.
The decor is quite like a traditional English pub, although it has an American feel to it. There are no dart boards but otherwise the place could be transplanted to England and it could fit in nicely.
The beer selection is outstanding.
The menu offers a wide variety of pasty choices so all tastes can be accommodated.
Just remember that you are eating at an establishment that specializes in one item. So, order a pasty, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a real treat. 
We chose it for my birthday dinner and I couldn't have been more pleased. 
The decor is somewhat rustic, the wait staff very accommodating and friendly, but if you need a back on your seat carefully choose where you're seated. (Lots of bench seats)
We started with the Cornish Meatball appetizer and shared it as the portion was very ample. 
For the main course my wife chose the Oggie (The Tradition Pasty) and I had the Peppered Steak which had a delightful brandy cream sauce and Stilton blue cheese inside the pasty. 
Our dessert was the chocolate bread pudding (superb) and since it was my birthday a complimentary drink called a Car Bomb which is about 4 inches of Guinness, a shot of Jameson and a shot glass of Baileys which gets dropped in and chugged. 
What a great meld of flavors. 
We've known about the restaurant for quite some time (Check Please Arizona) and now regret we hadn't tried it sooner. 
It was soooo good we'll be having dinner there on New Years Eve.  
This place just made our list of repeat eateries."}
{"text":"The bartender made great beverage and food suggestions. I ate at the bar. Everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"I visit Cornish Pasty 2-3 times a month. Great atmosphere, huge beer selection, and dog friendly patio. I like the Italian and Cajun Chicken pastys the best, although I've never had one I didn't like. Fun place for a date, a big party, or someplace different to take your out of town friends.

Staff is super friendly... I always seem to get the same server. VICTORIA! She's the best. Sit in her section, the girl won't letcha down."}
{"text":"This is prolly my favorite place in scottsdale (along with jalapeño inferno). The food is soooo amazing and have great tap beer collection. The atmosphere has a lot of character and def a cool laid back fun environment for dinner and drinks. Never disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was exceptionally competent and friendly and brought me my food and the food was excellent I had the English breakfast pasty and it was wonderful"}
{"text":"The setup is very community-driven with a spacious bar setting indoors and tables and community tables outdoors. The patio is also surrounded by misting machines that go just enough to keep the air cool but not enough to be bothersome.

The menu is full with regular pasties and premium pasties in addition to salads. They also have a good drink and beer menu. Sides are separate and not included with the entrees so plan on paying extra for them; they are big enough to split, however, especially considering how large the pasties are.

We ordered the Rosemary Chicken and The Pilgrim pasties and were delighted with our meals. The Rosemary Chicken was moist and well seasoned and paired well with the mustard cream sauce. Likewise, The Pilgrim was superb and reminded us of a thoughtful Thanksgiving dinner paired with a red wine gravy that added a touch of tartness. The garlic cheese mashed potatoes were tasty and coated in baked cheese.

The food came In huge portions and tasted authentic. The outdoor seating is quiet during the day with good, chill music. Its simply an awesome menu with top-notch execution nestled in a little slice of Britain. If we lived here, this would be a weekly spot for us."}
{"text":"I got take out via Post Mates and this is incredible. I must go in person. Yum! Something new and different yet familiar and warming."}
{"text":"My first night being there, the waitress splash the sauce all over my back, I was not happy even after the manager kindly offered me the laundry and the free meal. BUT, after trying the food, I fell in love with the taste. Everything was cooked perfectly. It is a great place to dine, and drink. The taste of the food was so good that I forgot about my new shirt."}
{"text":"Good food and good service with a good selection of beers. I had the Greek Chicken and it was perfect"}
{"text":"First time here loved the place. We had never had a pastie before this, but it was excellent and service superb. After walking out of another establishment in the area who couldn't manage to acknowledge us we found this gem, so glad we did."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for food and drinks.  Been going consistently for over two years now.  Even if you are not hungry this a great place to have drinks and enjoy the great bar tenders! Eddie has been always great and remembered us since day one!  If you are looking for a great restaurant or bar to go and call home this is the place!"}
{"text":"We went to Cornish Pasty Co at 7pm on a Friday. There were 7 of us, 4 adults, 3 kids. We place our order, the server came back and told us that they were out of 2 of the Pasties. The server forgot to put in our app order, so when the pasties came, the appetizers followed. We ordered a pasty desert, and the server came back and said they were out of that pasty as well. Really disappointed in how they ran out of pasties on a holiday weekend by 7pm."}
{"text":"Had lunch here one Saturday in Tempe (mill's ave) . the red pepper soup was the best I have eaten in a long time. Cajun chicken pastries is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty Company was a great late night dinner option in Old Town because we lost track of time and didn't each much at all throughout the night. Open until midnight and with the kitchen taking their last order around 11:40, we made it just in time to grab a couple of pasties. I slept like a baby that night after eating the baked pastry that definitely hit the spot.

This location is large with both indoor seating, outdoor seating, and large communal tables. If you don't get a chance to look over the menu before you arrive, the choices for pasties are limitless and can be overwhelming. We didn't know what to get so we just asked the server and she suggested the chicken pesto and Guinness stew pasties. She didn't steer us wrong with the selections or service. Although I could have eaten anything at that moment, everything inside the flaky crust was delicious and tasted fresh. Two pasties was more than enough for two diners and the St. Archer coffee cream porter was a great paring for the pasties.

I wish we could have sampled more, but that was just bad time management of the night on our part. Depending on what you get, a pasty will run you an affordable $10-$11. There are also soups, salads, and sides on the menu. They have a full bar and the beer list isn't extensive but is rotating with a nice variety. It'll probably be a while before I'm back at this location, but there's no doubt I'll visit the Vegas location to try even more."}
{"text":"Went to the Pasty place in Tempe while staying at the Hotel right next door.  I had the Cajun one for lunch two days in a row.  It was amazing!   My wife was not as happy with hers, and she loves Pastys.  She thought the sauce on the Pilgrim had too much vinegar, and they were out of the other choices she wanted to try.  The restaurant was way too small on the inside, and the music was WAY too loud, so we decided on a 107 degree day to sit outside.  The service was pretty good, but they were OUT of half the menu....be warned.  The Scottsdale location has never been out of anything when we went, probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Hell. Yes. This mini-Pasty is an amazing little hole in Mill Ave that transports you to another place altogether. If you didn't know you were in Tempe, it would feel like Portland or Seattle or half of Southern California. 

It's pared down to the essentials: a half-dozen or so rotating pasty varieties, a smattering of soups and apps, and about a dozen draft beer options with one rotating tap handle, all crammed into a shoebox with nothing but a bar and a couple teeny tiny two-tops. But that pared-down space is also super cool, with tin ceilings, funky light fixtures, and super cool subway tile walls.

If you've ever been on Mill and thought \"Man, I wish Cornish Pasty Co was closer,\" this place is the answer to your hand pie prayers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on Mill. 
I stumbled in here with my boss while looking for some lunch to get to know each-other better over lunch and I have been coming back since.

The staff are really fun to talk to, the food is great, the beer is cold (and they have a great selection) and its almost entirely bar seating? Sign me up! 

The Pasty was originally a working mans lunch. Think of it like a large, dense, delicious hot pocket and this place has some awesome twists.
(Get the Cajun Chicken, Guinness Stew or Cubano. Go. Do it. Now. It's ok, ill wait.)

If you are looking for a small (almost literal) hole in the wall bar with great food and excellent people watching on weekends this place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious!

I've had this spot on my to do list forever.  I finally tried it over the weekend and boy was I missing out.  Simply amazing!  I've only ever had a pasty when I've been in the UK...and I may go as far as saying, it's better than what I experienced in Britain.

Modestly priced, great beer, and a large menu selection, including a full vegetarian menu offering the use of Quorn meatless products.  The atmosphere is modern pub with a nice relaxed ambiance.  I love how this spot offers traditional English eats with a culinary twist.

The cottage pie and tikka masala pasty was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Looove this place! Awesome neighborhood hangout, great place to grab a bite or a beer. I come here all the time and have been meaning to write a review forever...I'm sad to report that after ordering my usual leek soup yesterday (which is delicious and completely amazing) I bit into what appeared to be a wadded up receipt in my bread. Totally gross and super disappointing."}
{"text":"I went into this Cornish for the first time about a month ago, and just now remembered to write a review! I was not feeling very well and stopped in to get soup to-go. I ended up sitting at the bar talking to Stephanie for 45 minutes. Stephanie had many great menu recommendations and was great at picking out a beer according to my preference. 
Since it was slow, she served and bartended the entire place alone. She was fun, sweet and great with everyone. Noticed she even had a couple of regulars. 
I have always loved Cornish (the food is amazing), always worth the wait, the food has always been amazing. Now, I have another reason to come back!"}
{"text":"I like the food at Cornish Pasty...have been here several times before. But with some changes in the menu and me being a giant onion-phobe and feeling the need for a vegetable,  I ordered the chicken Tikka salad. Oh YUM.  How have I never had this before?   New favorite!"}
{"text":"Oh, Cornish Pasty. Your atmostphere is on point and your pastys are. So. Good. My boyfriend and I love eating at unique restaurants and he had never been to Cornish Pasty before. I had been to both the Tempe and Chandler locations (Tempe being my favorite), but living 4 minutes away, we had to try this one. I love the open, airiness of this location. It was much more inviting and seemed like anyone was welcome. There were people just sitting having a beer, kinda strewn about and not really at a table. It instantly made me feel like I was in place. I must also give a shout out to our bartender because I'm not exactly the easiest person to make a drink for and he made me a custom lemonhead-type martini that sent me into heaven. In fact, so much so that I got a second! We grabbed an Italian & a Chicken Pot Pie, with a caramel apple pasty for dessert. Left fat and so so happy."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service was a little slow but other than that, loved it.  Great patio and inside seating area."}
{"text":"Even though I really do love the food at Cornish Pasty, I have to give this location one star. I've never been to any restaurant where the employees genuinely act like I am an inconvenience. What pushed me too far this time was when we called in to place a to go order, and they were out of an item we ordered (which they've been out of now for about 2 weeks) we asked for her to hang on a second while we looked for something else to order and we were abruptly hung up on. So disrespectful! It would have just been so easy for her to say, \"I'm sorry, it's busy in here right now so once you know your order, please call back.\" Is that so hard? No, instead she just hung up because clearly our business to this location means nothing. This is the closest location to where I live and I hate that. I much prefer the Tempe location and will now, gladly drive out of my way to go to that location instead. Every single time I've been to the Scottsdale location I have felt judged, ignored and disrespected."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and have to admit I should probably get a part-time job here considering how often I am here. Beer selection is awesome! Management always rights their wrongs I have seen it firsthand, and it is such a great atmosphere. There patio is beautiful and their pricing and food selection is top-notch. Staff is awesome no matter who you get and it's pup friendly for the patio! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely comfort food and the drink/beer selection is super good! My husband and I went last Saturday and the service was terrific and the food was just as terrific! We had a Scotch Egg, which my husband had never tried and honestly he doesn't care for eggs, but the Scotch Egg was SO yummy even he loved it! He had the Guinness Stew Pastie and I had the Salmon Pastie.. both had such amazing flavor. The ambiance is nice, with candles on each table or the option to sit outside. What else is really neat? You can order to go AND finish baking at home! Love this idea!! We will definitely return to try more pasties."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch for the first time based on a friends recommendation. It was delicious! I will for sure be going back on my next trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"I first learned about Cornish Pasty Co from Happy Cow and had hoped to check it out on a trip to Vegas. I never made it, but then came to Arizona and loved it so much I checked out two locations in one week and truly wanted to eat it more often. Thanks so much for having daily vegan options. 

I am in love with the Greek. I'd never had a pasty before, but found this to be the most delicious way to eat all of my favorite veggies. At this location I was surprised to find it even included daiya cheese. It also came with a delicious tahini sauce on the side. I was slightly disappointed to find this location did not offer sides, but the great patio area definitely makes up for it. Its so nice to be able to sit on the bar seats on a nice night and watch the world go by. My dining partner had a hard time deciding which on the many pasties to sample, but assured me that whatever he choose was delicious. 

The bathroom is a little tricky and requires an ID to access the key. Its a bit tricky to find and around the corner, but nice inside. If you are a frequent urinator like me though this could be off putting. I plan to send an email and beg them to open a location in Seattle so I can have this deliciousness more often."}
{"text":"First, I have to say that the number one thing that I look for is service, this is the second to time that I have been here. Michelle was our waitress and she was absolutely amazing!   She was extreme attentive and personable. I will ask for her every time I come here!

Second, the decor and environment really make you feel comfortable and makes you wants to stays for hours!!! 

This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale and it is a must see!!!!!!! : )"}
{"text":"This is a small but great place to eat and drink.  It is about the size of a rail car.  I ordered the Shepard Pie and a Guinness.  I'm always concern on places like this to over season things with salt, but this was not the case.  The Shepard Pie was well season with a variety of spices.  It is very filling.  I ate maybe 3/4 of it and was pretty full.  Because the place is so small you end up smelling everything kitchen is cooking.  Someone ordered the tandoori chicken wings and it smelled amazing.  Was slightly jealous and kinda wanted to order one for myself.  Good place to visit, but be patient.  There is one bartender/server and a cook that bring you the food. They both work hard to provide excellent service.  I would be back.  This is a great spot, and they play punk/ska music.  The whole aesthetic and feel is punk rock. Come in with a good attitude and be chill.  Be prepared to be filled, but wanting more."}
{"text":"Met my peeps of the AOB. I like this place. I like the vibe. Our server was JJ. He was there when we needed him to be and gave us space when appropriate. Nice. Three of the four of us ordered Tea. Two of us ordered the Hibiscus green tea. I thought it was tasty but my friend did not. JJ swapped it out for the regular black tea and S. was satisfied.
S. ordered the Sausage Salad ($8.75) and asked JJ if the kitchen would just include one container of dressing instead of the usual 2. No problem. S. loved the salad. Plenty of sausage with just the right amount of red peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, red onion and feta cheese.
T. ordered the Royale, ($9.00), Medium. The only Pasty in the group. Funny. It's basically the innards of a cheeseburger plus french fries wrapped up in a pasty. T said it wasn't that great. The french fries were soggy and didn't add a good texture to the experience. He said the hamburger meat, mushrooms, bacon, grilled onions and cheese were fine. 
S. ordered the Pasta Salad, ($8.75). Bow Tie pasta with feta, parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, kalamata olives and roasted red peppers. She gave it a thumbs up. 
I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, ($9.00). Basically a whole chicken breast marinated in Indian spices and then baked, sliced and put atop a bed of Romaine lettuce. Cherry tomatoes, red onions and cucumbers round out the mix. I had the mint-yogurt dressing on the side. Yummy stuff. The chicken was perfectly spiced. This was a good salad.
Good food, good service, good pricing. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Oh dear... You had me at pasty!
This was my first time eating here after all the woooo's and yummmm's from my friends. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie and devoured it quickly. I had the Mexican and loved the flavor and spicy taste of the meat.
Everything was so delicious and we are excited to come back and taste the other pasties."}
{"text":"If you are in Scottsdale, and haven't tried The Cornish Pasty, you are missing out. It is a winner. The price is great, the food is better than great, and they know how to pour a proper pint of Guinness. My favorite pasty is the pilgrim. It's like thanksgiving in your mouth. It's also very vegetarian friendly, with several great veggie pasties on the menu. 
The beer is a bit expensive ($5-$7 pints) but they have such a great beer selection, that it's worth it."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place and the pasties taste really good. Great beers, we sat outdoors and it was a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some appetizers and a beer - They have a good selection of beer on tap, as well as bottled beer. They had Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap so I was happy.

We ordered three appetizers - All were nicely done and used quality ingredients. We had Chicken Liver Pâté with Crostini's and red onion marmalade, Tandoori Wings, and Scotch Eggs - Hardboiled egg, wrapped in sausage and breadcrumb with honey mustard. All were flavorful, My favorite as the scotch eggs. They had indoor and outdoor seating. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"When you think of the medieval ages, dark dungeons and dough pocket meals should be among at least the top 20 visuals.

I enjoyed my Royale with Cheese so much I ate my table mate's leftovers too. 

This place is fantastic for dates, solo dining, and funerals.

{"text":"Hit this place up on a day trip down from Vegas to see a concert at Marquee theater. This is within walking distance (about 15 mins if you want to do it) and is situated in a great, vibrant area right on Mill street and has open bar seating outside along with some little tables. We chose this place because it has good reviews and plenty of vegetarian options as well. Plus, it was someplace different that we've never tried. It is small, inside and out and was only patronized by 3 other people but we felt good about it and sat at the bar outside. The bartender was friendly and the music they played (hard rock) was a great choice, especially since we were going to see a rock concert in a couple hours. First off: the drinks were GREAT! The bartender made me a \"house\" old fashioned that was so good my boyfriend ordered one as well. When we had the second one it had to be done by another bartender and she made it spot on just like him so props on getting that shit down! The food was good and filling. Pastors are similar to calzones for anyone who doesn't know (like my bf) and I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan pasty and my boyfriend had the Veggie Cubano. Both were really good and very filling! They ran about $11/each before tax. We stayed for dessert and chose the chocolate bread pudding which was good and even came with a generous side of vanilla ice cream- which is very important because you need the balance! We enjoyed conversing with the bartender, talked with the other patrons and even had an Irish car bomb with three other people at the bar because Why not, right? Great little spot with friendly staff and good food. Try it if you have the chance! On a side note: there's not a restroom in the place (it's really small) but there is one around the corner you just have to ask for a key fob."}
{"text":"I know, I know... I'm the only person on the planet who isn't in love with CPC.... I think maybe I have an ordering malfunction, but my pasties just haven't been all that. The last time I was there, I got the chicken tikka masala pasty at the recommendation of the waitress, and it lacked a lot of spice or flavor. It just was nothing special. I need to come back and try them again, because I'm sure there are other delicious options, but for now, I'll go with 3 stars."}
{"text":"If you like pizza pockets with flavor and different meats This is your place. I am not kidding these are gourmet pizza pockets not your college pizza pockets"}
{"text":"Went there last weekend. We ere looking for something new. We were very impressed by the decor and atmosphere as well as the service. We ordered a few cocktails. The drinks were not very well made. My girlfriend got the tequila mile and it tasted almost entirely of tequila with nothing else in it. We ordered scotch eggs which were overcooked but still tasted good. The food was good but a little heavy on the salt. All in all don't think we well be coming back but it was a fun spot to try."}
{"text":"First visit.  Looks sketchy on outside and very dark inside.  Waiter was high as a kite but service was good and food was great.  Had Salmon-nice combination and pastry was perfectly flakey .  And apple for dessert .  Will come back with bigger appetite"}
{"text":"This one only gets three stars because out of all the locations it is my least favorite. It's very small and thin. Think of a walk-in closet in a 1980s track home. But just like every other location the food is amazing the staff is unique and you know exactly what you're getting and it's food that you actually crave and must have.
I have a lot of friends who don't eat meat and actually don't even like fake meat but whatever the chicken substitute that this place uses my vegetarian friends rave about. Now The food is very filling, but let me say that it reheats perfectly so you definitely want to save room for dessert. The apple pie Cornish pasty as well as the peanut butter and jelly one are amazing for dessert but nothing beats the banoffee pie. Even to go. 
My only critique is that their homemade whipped cream is not very sweet"}
{"text":"First of all I highly recommend the curried potatoes!!This was my second time visiting this location and been to the Mesa location a few times and it's been nothing but awesome every time. We recently visited on a sleepy late Sunday night. I usually get the Greek with Quorn fake chicken type meat- I get Quorn at the grocery store so I already know it's awesome. It's not soy but better. All the yums. Trust. You will not be disappointed. Plus enough leftovers to take to work on Monday! I love the large selection of vegetarian pastys."}
{"text":"A hearty meal, and a decent beer selection.  First time here, Wednesday last week. We got a scotch egg, and split a bangers and mash pasty. Im no authority on english cuisine,  but it was all delicious,  and if split, enough for two and reasonably priced. 
Although I've only had the \"traditional offerings\" (bangers and mash, scotch egg, and Sheppard's pie), some of the other offerings that blend english cuisine with other nationalities dishes sound positively untenable: mexican pasty? Chicken Alfredo (pasty)? Maybe I'm just not adventurous enough.
The vibe is also a little confused, like a mill ave establishment that has snuck into old town Scottsdale. Strangely,  I think I would give it another star if it would just choose what it is - a communal tabled English drinking bar for out-of-towners, or a hipster hangout with a slightly grubby feeling; and go with it. I'll go back, and try to determine if it's a good fit for me and boys slugging beers and eating unhealthily,  or for the wife, and kids on a school night. It might work as either."}
{"text":"I really just noticed that aside from the pasties, they have fresh salads! Yay! I ordered the Blinkin' Heng (awesome name). It was delicious. Just a note if they're reading this: The presentation was off because the turkey looked like the last bit of meat scraped off the carcass."}
{"text":"I can't believe how good the bangers and mash pasty was.  Without a doubt, within top 10 things I've ever eaten.  Possibly top 6.  I see they have a place in Boston and vegas... already bookmarked."}
{"text":"Been here several times, never dissapointed. Excellent food, service and environment. Lots of menu selections."}
{"text":"Yum. Just yum. There is no way anyone could go here and NOT find something they like! So many options and everything is so good! The waitress informed me that you can order their homemade bread... Can I please have one loaf for every day of the year? Heavenly!! The customer service was really great as well! The only reason I didn't give them five stars was the restaurant itself was a little grungy and needed some attention to detail as far as cleaning. Everything else was incredible, I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I always came for dinner and the place is always packed! The entree I always went back for was lovely bit o salmon! However, every pastry I tried was amazingly delicious and their drinks were also superb. I highly recommend you give them a try next time you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Piping hot and tasty. Rosemary chicken flavorful and filling! Wonderful, friendly staff. Thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Was able to try the one in Mesa and LOVED it.  Great atmosphere, service & food was excellent.  Looking forward to trying the one in Scottsdale (is closer)  Will be back to review!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave this place 0 stars.  Or negative stars for that matter. March 9, 2018: one of the worst experiences I've ever had in Old Town Scottsdale. 

I arrived at Cornish to have dinner with my best friend Dan.  Everything was going great. We sat down at the bar, ordered our respective entrees, and proceeded to what we thought would be a great night. We ordered Irish car bombs, Moscow mules, and Jack and diets.  We were having a great time.

About one hour after we arrived, four friends of ours arrived.  They sat down next to us and ordered drinks. After they ordered, we decided we should move to a table that coule accommodate our party. We asked our server for our tab.  She gave us a table with all of the items on one check.

Not an issue, but since we all arrived at different times, we asked the server if she could split the check.  She replied: \"I don't have time for that.\" We were surprised.  We asked again, but were ignored.  We decided we needed to take things into our own hands and had our friend split the check.

After our friend finished splitting the check and calculating Arizona sales tax, we then left the check at the counter with our credit cards so we could pay. The server then slammed the bill with our cards in front of us and then had the other server hand it to us. She apparently thought that our request to split the check wasn't adequate. Again, we weren't being rude.  We just had different parties come at different times.  And offered to split ourselves.

We closed out, sat down at the nearby table and finished our night. We were so disgusted with the service experience that we decided to leave. 

As we were leaving, my good friend looked at one of the employees and said \"have a good night\", to which she replied with no words, only a body spasm and a look of disgust with a cold shoulder. I wish that the employees at Cornish party had more time to add up checks and be friendly like all other restaurant we go to. Step up your game Cornish pasty!"}
{"text":"My first time at this location. I am a frequent Cornish pasty diner at the Tempe location and find that this place fell way below expectation. I was greeted by a polite hostess only to be followed by a long wait by the waitress. She grabbed our waters and didn't come back until we had to flag down our hostess. We were then informed that over half the menu was out, including the some appetizers. She should have informed us of this before making us wait."}
{"text":"These pasties are delicious.  I never had anything like those before.  I got the lamb pasty and it was very flavorful, especially with the sauce that came with it.  Service was excellent.

WARNING:  It'll take time for your food to get ready, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty starts by being everything a hot pocket promises to be and never is, but goes far beyond the extra mile with interesting options and amazing desserts. 

To me, this is the epitome of comfort food: the crust is perfection, the fillings are bursting with flavor, and the sides of sauce are just that extra touch. And the fact that I can eat this delightful food while drinking a British (or local) ale of my choice makes this place a favorite. The wide selection of options means that there is something everyone will like. If you're feeling a little adventurous, try the scotch egg--so good! For a perfect ending to the evening, make sure you order the sticky toffee pudding. It's served oven hot in a little cauldron and is best with ice cream."}
{"text":"4 stars now because the Manager offered a special order with a discount. I haven't tried this place again yet but will soon. Seems like our visit happened on a bad day (things go wrong sometimes I get that :)) and this was a nice gesture from them. Thank you Dean for reaching out :)"}
{"text":"I've gone to the one in Tempe a few times I've always had a good meal, this location is bigger and a better layout. Still has very good food had the traditional shepherd's pie."}
{"text":"I really love this place, it's hard to know where to start in describing exactly why. The original location is super cool, but this spot takes the cake. Not to mention Old Town badly needs a laid-back hideout for those of us that don't jive comfortable with the normal Scottsdale crowds in the area (i.e. bros and blue hairs). They've done a phenomenal job turning this into a slightly hipster but not at all pretentious hangout. They even let me host a co-ed \"baby shower\" there without judging - and our waiter ROCKED.

First of all, the patio is fabulous when the weather is nice. They have misters of course for hotter days, and it's dog friendly. The inside has a super cool vibe with amazing wall paper and pictures of coal miners for a cool vintage touch (read the backstory re: pasties). The food is consistently excellent and extremely filling - an excellent reminder to keep up my fitness habit. The meatless menu is huge, though I always order the same thing (mmmm vegan Chicken Tikka Masala). I devoured their fries for the first time last weekend, they were spicy and delicious. The only thing I haven't completely demolished was the Strawberry Pavlova. There was nothing wrong with it at all, it just wasn't chocolate covered in more chocolate so... not really my thing. But fruit lovers would probably really like it. The beer selection is awesome with great local options, and while I haven't tried the cocktails, I've heard good things about those too.

Come here for dinner or just a drink, enjoy the patio or escape the heat inside at the bar - there's not a bad time to visit. This will definitely be on the regular rotation for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pilgrim, reuben, Alfredo, portobello, and meat and cheese.  My fussy eater didn't like ham and potatoes in his Alfredo Pasty.  I tried the Pilgrim, Alfredo and meat and cheese all were delicious!  The flakey crust was tasty and beautiful.  We had a wonderful banquet.  I am already looking forward to my next trip.  I only wish they would come Arrowhead/Westside Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went to Cornish Pasty in Goldwater a few days ago and I had a wonderful experience; 
1) the food is spectacular and very particular, I had the \"carne avolada pasty\" and I found it delicious;
2) the service and the staff is even better... I was there because of my boyfriend's birthday party and they took good care of us, also with the birthday cake brought at the end of the dinner...(perfect timing)
3) the prices are good, not too expensive and not to cheap.

Concluding, if you want to try an English place, this is the one you're looking for! :)"}
{"text":"I love Cornish Pasty Co.  The first time I came here, I was a second year resident in the middle of my Burn Surgery rotation.  I was sleep-deprived, poorly-fed, and the only thing that kept me awake during the meal was the sheer deliciousness of the food being shoveled down my throat by my concerned husband.

Since then, I've been back a variety of times.  Pasty-wise, the Lamb and Mint is my usual go-to, but I also love the Bangers and Mash, the Shepherd's Pie, and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  

I'm going to be weird here.  My last few visits, I've actually not gotten a pasty (cue the horrified gasps).  I'm now addicted to the Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Soup.  It comes with delicious fresh-baked bread that I use as a spoon.  A bowl of it will only set you back about $7, and honestly I think it's the best thing on the menu.  I've used the fact that I'm \"just having soup\" to justify having dessert recently (the Sticky Toffee Pudding is perfect!), and I think I'll probably continue to eat non-pasties at the Pasty Company in the future."}
{"text":"An Interesting Experience In A Pleasant Setting

I had noticed the Cornish Pasty Co. when it first opened, and made a mental note to try it sometime. I especially loved the setting, and the bar open to the outside called my name. When I finally visited recently, I really loved just sitting there people watching. The service was friendly and prompt and I had a been in front of me in no time at all. 

Because I was completely unfamiliar with Pasties, I wasn't quite sure what to expect in terms of the flavor or texture. I ordered the Oggie (the traditional pasty) with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga because it seemed like a good place to start. 

When my pasty came, is was golden brown, and piping hot. (a good way to start) I enjoyed my first bite of the crust, but from that point forward was disappointed. I think that I had built my expectations up too much, and that this style of food is just not what I enjoy. It was probably completely authentic and correct. I was left flat in terms of flavor, and wished that I had instead ordered something less traditional and more juicy and savory. I did not find that the gravy really helped much and ended up adding quite a bit of salt and pepper to encourage myself to consume my pasty. 

I gave the Cornish Pasty Co 4 stars because I believe that they deliver what they say they will deliver and they deserve the benefit of the doubt. It just didn't suit me. They deserve points as well for the excellent service and marvelous, fun, setting.

I also really enjoyed the beer recommended to me by the bartender."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day outside and we opted for the patio. We tried the oven chips and mushroom, spinach soup to start which were both delicious! We tried the cottage pie and the pilgram. The cottage was like Shepherds pie in the pasty dough and was perfectly stuffed with ground beef, mashed potatoes, cheese and veggies. Yum! The pilgram was turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and sage. Served with cranberry sauce. Loved it! We topped in off with banoffee pie! Omg.. best dessert ever. Graham crackers, caramel, whipped cream and bananas. Sooooo good. Caitlin was our server and she was just awesome. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the Tempe Location. There are less hipsters and it feels less \"trendy\" in a good way. I got the royal with cheese and my boyfriend got the mexican. Both were delicious. We went for lunch and the large restaurant was not too crowded. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. 

It's a great place to go when you are in the mood for something a little different with some yummy beer on tap!"}
{"text":"My first visit I tried the Hawaiian burger, it's bomb!

I've been talking about this place to my clients and coworkers every week."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time a few months ago and I loved it. I have gone back a few more times and got the great pasties(I think that's how you would spell it?) as well as the great beers they have on Tap! I have tried the peppered steak, the roast dinner, and guinness stew. Every time it has been amazing. Definitely recommend this place! I brought my friend who was visiting here last night and they liked it! Not your typical type of food, but English cuisine and delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner one night with some friends. Inside the restaurant is self seat, I believe, and it was packed, so we sat outside under some misters.

Bartender was pretty attentive. He was good on getting us drinks and taking orders. We started with some wings, which were fine. Not a big wing person, but my friends are, and they liked them. We also had some fries as a starter, which were pretty good. Not extraordinary, but I enjoyed them.

I had the lamb vindaloo pasty, which tasted like a premade Indian flavored dish was stuffed into the pasty and frozen, then baked for me after I ordered. Not great. Chicken Greek pasty was WAY too heavy on the olives, even for my olive loving husband. Did not enjoy that one at all.

Prices for the pasties are a bit high, in my opinion. I don't think I would go back, but I do think the concept of the restaurant is interesting and in cooler weather, the patio would be really nice."}
{"text":"Cornish Pasty...Mmmm so many carbs so little time! Oh how I love anything hot and wrapped in dough!

I enjoy most of the vegetarian pasties (eggplant parm and the greek with spinach, mozzarella, feta, tomatoes, etc.), but my absolute fave is the Cheese and Onion pasty. It is filled with potatoes, onion, rutabaga and cheese and it is just deliciously simple. In my humble opinion, ketchup needs to be your dipping sauce of choice when you're eating this baby. I've tried it with marinara but it just doesn't have enough \"bite\".

For dessert you cannot go wrong with the banofee pie pasty. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, fresh whipped cream and sliced bananas make this treat a MUST TRY. It is sooo gooood. And the Apple Caramel Pasty is a very, very close second. That thing is fantastic!

While I have patronized the Tempe location, I prefer Scottsdale. It's cleaner and there are far less hipsters in flannel shirts with huge beards strutting around."}
{"text":"This is such a unique place, I would highly recommend it. The Cajun chicken pasty is my favorite, but they are all really good. 
They always have great service and the atmosphere makes for a fun time. You can bring large groups or it can be a small get together. Make sure you sick around for desert, the banafi is amazing. 
The only downside is their mixed drinks. They are unique, but always watered down when I get one. The huge beer selection more than makes up for it though."}
{"text":"I heard so much about Pasty's and I've been on hiatus eating out since I've had my little one , but now that im back at work ... so BRING IT ! I ordered the Italian Pasty which has Pepperoni, salami, capocollo, ham, mozzarella, fresh basil, and roasted tomatoes.  I never had a pasty in my life and oh man have I missed out . The crust was buttery , yet a little light (  ) and flakey and the layers if the inside was more than perfection . I ate  1/2 and was expecting to revisit the other half for dinner and that didn't work out so well. I cant wait to go back and try others."}
{"text":"Beautiful dog-friendly patio. Our waitress was attentive and our food was delicious. Definitely will be visiting in the future!"}
{"text":"service was incredibly lame after the awesome service we had down town.! I asked for a napkin to wipe off the beer soaked bar. Shouldn't be a personal attack right? The beer tender wiped off the bar with a drenched beer soaked towell that .... dripped isn't strong enough to describe it drenched my dress. Tee hee Omg I'm so cute. No. No you're not. I smell like a effing bar mat all over my lap. Thanks bitch."}
{"text":"First time visit to this location and as standard with the other locations - friendly, timely, informative service. We enjoyed our Sunday afternoon sipping a few draft choices and noshing on the delicious chocolate bread pudding. Their pasty's are quite good too, but we were only in for dessert. You won't be disappointed either way. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Same great food as the other locations but since this is a brand new place, the décor is much more hip and modern. Of course it is Scottsdale so it had to be a little fancier, right? They even have a nice patio out front. I went there for the ISC and we all had a great time. Our server was great and the food came out pretty fast. I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to hang out in Scottsdale. Thank you for setting one up within 2 miles of my house!!! Great beers - the chicken tandoori and lamb vindaloo pasties are head and shoulders above the rest and my recommendation if you like spice. Brilliant ambiance, very pleasant and fun waiting staff --- all make for a great experience."}
{"text":"First time I ate here, I was really impressed with how big the menu was. So many different choices of pasty's to chose from. They have a great selection of wine and beer to chose from also. Great date spot! Defiantly coming back to try the 5 other pasty's that I wasn't able to order."}
{"text":"So yummy. Pastrami with Swiss and sauerkraut was excellent. I also tried the curry lamb and mint lamb both were really good. The patsy was crisp and cooked really well. Great service and nice variety on the menu"}
{"text":"A very nice place to dining inside or outside.  The menu has a Great selection of food.  They have quite a selection for Vegetarians too.  I ordered \"The Porker\" pasty.  It was huge and delicious.  I'm definitely going back to try other menu selections."}
{"text":"Had a get-together here with my friends and it was great! The Pilgrim is amazing and definitely my favorite. It is a fun atmosphere and Kendra was a hoot; she kept us laughing and our bellies full. :)"}
{"text":"Authentic British food (were from Britain) and a good pint of bodingtons ale. Really enjoyed it there and would go again"}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to the Cornish Pasty Co. when she brought home leftovers from the original Tempe location. I had tried the Portobello Chicken and I think the Cajun, neither I was crazy about but my wife had got the Chicken Greek and loved it.

One day we went to Scottsdale Fashion Square and wanted lunch so we went to the location on Goldwater Blvd. I can't remember which I tried first since it's been so long but I now have two favorites -- the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Carne Adovada. Both are very spicy but very good. My wife prefers the Veggie Greek or Chicken Greek but apparently they changed their recipe and added cauliflower which she dislikes. Since the pasties are prepared ahead of time they can't be customized.

The Scottsdale location is my favorite but we've also been to the one in Mesa where we usually get part bake and take back to my in-laws'. We've also been to the Las Vegas location which is located in a nearly abandoned strip mall in a bad part of town. I prefer the Scottsdale location mainly because the inside is nicer than the other locations. I have yet been to either Tempe location or the recently-opened one in downtown Phoenix which isn't too far from work.

The Cornish Pasty Co. is frequently my go-to place if I'm hungry in Scottsdale or Mesa and if you are thinking this place doesn't sound all that interesting, please give them a try because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I had a really nice dinner here last night with my husband and toddler daughter and neighbor, Trystan.  Our neighbor is actually from Cornwall and he was the one who brought us here to try the regional specialty of his home turf.  Obviously, he is a regular here.
  
Now I had been to the Cornish Pasty location in Tempe, but it had been a few years ago, so for all intents and purposes this was my first real, sit-down visit.  

They let us sit where we wanted and we chose a nice spot out on the patio and they brought us a high chair and drink.  I got a glass of the house Riesling.  (It was delicious) and our waitress brought a small pewter plate of bread slices and a small dipping cup of tomato soup for our daughter.  I thought that was really thoughtful of her.

We ordered a side of chips with a spicy bean dip for the table, and everyone enjoyed that.  I also got to taste the cup of soup that Trystan ordered, a creamy potato, leek and Stilton cheese combination.  Honestly I wished I'd ordered a whole bowl of that soup for myself!  Amazing.

I ordered the Oggie pasty and it was a thing of beauty, deliciously browned and filled with a hearty, meat and root vegetable mixture.  It came with a flavorful sauce that I *think* was a red wine reduction.  My husband got the Cottage Pie and he said he really liked it.  And apparently it was hefty enough that he had enough leftovers to take for lunch today.  

By the end of dinner we didn't have any room for dessert, which means we will just have to make an effort to come back and try their delicious sounding desserts; like sticky English toffee pudding!

Keep it up guys, I really liked what I saw last night; the food, service, ambiance, everything.  Spot on!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month for a pasty. They are reasonably priced and a nice alternative when tired of pizza or burgers. However, one of the biggest draws for me if that it is open late. Even if the social hub of Scottsdale Old Town, most kitchens close around 10pm. Cornish Pasty is open till midnight.

I have tried most of their pasties. I have yet to have a bad one. However, a few could use a bit more spices.

I also wish they had a reverse happy hour starting around 10pm. It usually has less than a dozen in the restaurant when I have been there late night. I think this place could be more popular with its relaxed patio would be great for a casual drink with friends at that after 10pm window."}
{"text":"Had a late Sunday lunch with the family. The food was so good. I had the Salmon Pastie and cleaned the plate. Portions are pretty big so I was stuffed but could not stop eating. Also great beer selection and a really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place deserves so much more recognition that it receives. Personally, I never did this place justice. Instead of hitting up a place that made me feel like Baymax from Big Hero 6, I constantly hit up In-N-Out and got hungry an hour later. Looking back on my life, I've cheated on tests, got caught cheating on said tests, and have done other things probably not condoned by my neighborhood pastor. But I don't regret any of those decisions. Cornish is different, I regret not going here more.


The parking situation is not ideal, but the food is. Every time I went I got the cheeseburger cornish, and each time I vowed to tell my Super Bowl homies that this would be the place to come for Super Bowl meals. The servings are ginormous. I'm not a big dude, nor do I really wanna be a big dude, but I feel like Taylor Lautner circa New Moon couldn't gobble one of these down even in wolf form. 

I've gotta applaud the service too. I've called in beforehand, arrived 10 minutes later than my reservation, and have come during a lunch rush. Each time the food came out in a timely manner. 

For a place that transplanted the camp from the Parent Trap to a restaurant in Scottsdale, it is quite impressive. When I come back to Scottsdale, this will be one of the first stops."}
{"text":"This location is a little different then their other locations. The other locations are more grudge type of bar, the sco one on the other hand has a nice clean look to it. All the pastes that i have tried so far have been awesome. And plus the beer are super cheap. So glad they finally have a location in sco."}
{"text":"Do you know what a Pasty is? When I think of the word Pasty I only think of one thing and it usually has the word \"Nipple\" attached to it. If you're an uneducated American like myself who has no idea what English cuisine is then you might want to skip Cornish Pasty co. 

Came in at the nik of time driving like a maniac to get there before 12 and I almost kinda wished we would have gone to Whataburger instead.. 

Scotch Egg: JY and I's first experience and safe to say it will be our last. It just wasn't tasty. 

Pasty: Hailing from the city of angels, I've never heard even heard of this term as a food item, however, I quickly learned it's essentially an Empanada with hot pocket filling. Yep.. That's pretty much it. 

Peppered Steak: No Bueno bro. 

Pesto Chicken: This was more enjoyable than the peppered steak but not by much. 

*Enjoyed the late night ambiance and looking at the cool hipster looks with the tat's and ear plugs behind the counter. 

Price: It's about $8-10 for each pasty. Totally not worth it IMO. 

Cheers, 

J to the Y."}
{"text":"I had been a huge fan of the other two Cornish Pasty locations in the valley and had been eagerly waiting the opening of this one closer to where I now live. In short, it didn't disappoint and was fantastic as always. 
But to be more detailed, the new location is amazing. The remodel/renovation they did on the property is beautiful. Adequate amount of both inside and outside seating. They have several large tables, so it's a great place to come with big groups as you can all fit at the same table and eat, drink, and be able to converse together. The ambiance in general is casual and mellow, but with that unique gastropub vibe.
Menu selection is huge, there is truly a pasty for anyone. The beer selection is also great. I really like the fact they have 14, 20, and 32 oz draft sizes, rather than just standard pints. You're bound to find something that you like here, and it's always matched by friendly and helpful waitstaff that makes for an enjoyable experience every time."}
{"text":"I stopped in this newer Cornish Pasty with the International Supper Club UYE (#ISCUYE) for February!  

This restaurant sits in the shadows of old town, just south of the hussle and bussle around Camelback.  

I give this place 4 stars because the pasties are just as yummy and tasty as the orginal, but this building that it is in is just beautiful.  A prefect British pub with these HUGE tables.  this is the perfect place for a large group.  I think our group was about 18 or so and we all sat at one table.  And there aren't just a few large tables, there are a ton of them.

They have this fantastic and beautiful patio.  I can't wait to return and sit out there."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a change of pace, and remembered this little spot down on mill avenue, so stopped in for lunch and am so glad I did! First, I had a drink, a half and half beer made with Guinness and Huss Koffee Kolsch. Outstanding. So good I had to have a second. Then I ordered the peppered steak pasty for the lunch. What a delicious treat, and the \"red wine sauce\" is beyond amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome British food! Is that a thing? Apparently yes in Tempe! Delicious bangers and mash pasty with sweet and savory red wine gravy. Good selection of draft beers too."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!  The food is amazing, atmosphere is great and has indoor and outdoor seating with a dog friendly patio.  My fiance' and I come here frequently and hang out with our dog.  We are both vegan and we are very happy to say that the vegan options here keep getting better and better.  They usually have at least two vegan pasty options every day, but the last time we were there they had 4 different options and kinds we never tried before!!  Everything we have had there is great and we will keep coming back and we recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"It's so easy to give this place 5 stars because they do what they do so well. Not pretentious.....just good pastys (Gourmet hot pockets if you want to explain to a friend)...beer...and an amazing setting!Certainly one of the best restaurant designs in Scottsdale. Good for a date, even better for groups, or just come by your lonesome and enjoy all the beautiful creatures that frequent."}
{"text":"Delicious.  It's hard to choose.  A favorite is the Pilgrim.   A complete Turkey Dinner in a crispy crust.  Sounds gross but it's yummy!  Share one and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a fancy hot pocket? NO!? Well, Cornish Pasty is the place to make your dreams come true. The ambiance is amazing and the location is perfect for a chill night out without all of the Old Town Scottsdale chaos."}
