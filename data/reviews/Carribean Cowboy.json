{"text":"We were so excited to try this place, we didn't find out our servers name until we found it printed on the check. 
We were never offered anything more than water drink wise. 
We ordered an appetizer that came out after our dry tasteless burgers and that was only because we reminded the server Valeria that we ordered an app to begin with. We were never told that they ran out of the appetizer and had to make more. We got a free dessert when the manager came and asked us how everything was. That and the app were good but I really don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We were with a big group (15), but there was no one else in the restaurant. It took 1 1/2 hours to get our food. Something was definitely fishy about the bill process. Half of the bills weren't correct and were brought out at different times. Weird charges appeared on some of the bills. When we received our bill, the waitress didn't add the soda and said just add $2.50 to the bill. Was she trying to pocket the soda money?  Or was the restaurant trying to scam the government out of additional tax money? Or were the staff just incompetent? In any event, was a weird dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Great food - large beverage selection - beautiful inside & outside - plenty of parking - live music on weekends - no cover charge.

Thank you Caribbean Cowboy for hiring local live talent. So many restaurants & taverns just want you to pump money into their juke box and offer no entertainment value.

Beverages cost slightly higher than your corner beer/shot bar, but for the additional $.25 it's worth the pleasant atmosphere and free entertainment.

Huge menu! Surprisingly, everything we all ordered was delicious.

Immaculate! Cleanest restaurant I have seen in a long time. Even the high-level wasn't dusty and the bathrooms were spotless. (the women said the same thing about the ladies restroom)

Goofy theme...Caribbean decor with western apparel....Doesn't work for me, but credit for being clever.

If you have a group or small party and want seating together on a peak dinner hour, this place is the best kept secret in North Royalton.

I just don't understand why everybody doesn't know about this place and it is not packed."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday.  Only people in restaurant.  Waited almost an hour for food.  Worst meal ever.  Person in my party given mayo instead of sour cream for baked potato.  No salsa on fish tacos. Worst tasting green beans ever.  Watery drinks.  Dry chicken."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. A group of 10 of us (with a reservation) met here for dinner last night; the restaurant was empty. It was all downhill after that. The website stated that it was \"Ladies Night\" but the waitress didn't seem to know about any drink specials. We arrived at 6:30 and ordered our food around 7:00. As of 9:10, one woman in our party had not yet received her food! The food started coming out around 8:00 (yes, an hour after placing our orders!) one or two entrees at a time, about every 10 - 15 minutes. So, some of us were finished eating before others of us even got our food. The sweet potato fries were raw, a burger was cold, regular fries were cold and limp, I ordered rice and beans as a side with my fish tacos, and finally got it 10 minutes after my order came, etc. Something was wrong with almost every order! It was a downright unpleasant experience. The manager seemed indifferent, saying there was a new cook. She offered to take $25 ($2.50 each) off the total bill. That seemed lame. In the end, she finally realized that the night was a total disaster for us (and for Caribbean Cowboy), and after some discussion with our party, she comped our bills. That being said, I would not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My family's been there an unprecedented three times this week the food is remarkably fresh especially for midwinter. Everything is fresh fresh fresh it's immaculately clean. Everything's been cooked to perfection so far. On our first visit last Tuesday we were surprised to find out there was karaoke starting at 8 o'clock that was very friendly and encouraging due to the karaoke host who remembers and uses your name after hearing it once. He is very gracious and seems to be very good at putting people at ease and making them feel comfortable.  I believe his name is Bobby Bruno, and somebody I was speaking to in the restaurant told me that she's known him since she was a little girl and he was always great like that.  My daughter pointed out he had the best microphones we have ever seen anyone use for karaoke. Tuesday and Sunday were dead Friday was very busy. The service was extremely friendly and efficent on Friday and Sunday I was surprised about the comment about the servers, Tuesday server was efficient and professional,  not as outgoing as the others, but none the less she was very good. The food is extremely well made and fresh"}
{"text":"Went to the Caribbean Cowboy last night. The sign was attractive, but the outside of the building though in good repair,was kind of boring looking.  I was having my doubts... What a nice surprise when we walked inside! If you love a Tropical atmosphere, crave sunshine and the beach, this is your place. I am not much of a country fan but I know from my daughter that Cowboys do enjoy the beach too. The painted mural/ artwork on the wall  is awesome! Especially on a cold, rainy April night. Lots of atmosphere here. And clean! No dusty knickknack or grimy fingerprints.  Check other reviews for the pictures. Our server was pleasant and efficient. The jerk chicken kabobs delicious with a bit of heat. I had the sampler platter of barbecue and the ribs were fall off the bone! Brisket and pulled pork, very good. House dressing on the salad was great. And the corn muffin was sweet and moist! No butter needed.  Then to our surprise the entertainment started at 8 pm. Which suits me fine! I don't know why other places make you wait until 9-10 to get  things going. This was a wonderful find. Like someone said this is a hidden gem, but I hope not to hidden so they stay in business. Plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit to the Caribbean Cowboy on Rt 82 in North Royalton. This is an interestingly themed restaurant with country music, servers and bartenders in cowboy hats and a meat-heavy menu that includes traditional barbecue type food and jerk-marinaded meats. If you don't like Jimmy Buffett, you should know that it's in heavy rotation. In fact, we suspect that the album \"Banana Wind\" was actually playing.

We went on Saturday night, the day after New Years so it wasn't terribly surprising that the place wasn't busy, although we were also there at 6:30 PM. There were 4 people at the bar and about 6 more in the booths and tables; total seating is probably about 100 including the relatively sizable bar. There is a small stage and also a jukebox. There are frequently bands but tonight a DJ was scheduled at 8 pm.

The restaurant is well lit and the menu relatively broad, including soups and sandwiches, barbecue plates and salads. We didn't try any of the appetizers but we did settle on a Philly steak sandwich made with brisket and a BBQ combo platter that included pulled pork, ribs and brisket. The sandwich came with sweet potato fries and I opted for the beans and rice to go with the vegetable side on the BBQ platter, as well as a balsamic vinaigrette on my salad (which came with a truly outstanding cornbread).

I wanted to give a better rating. The meats are excellent here, the jerk chicken I've had twice and it's unbelievably good. And the owner is always there and she's very friendly. But here's the problem I had: there are many, many places to go eat. And many, many of them have talented chefs making really good stuff, like at Caribbean Cowboy. So it's little things that can really sink the experience. For the meats and the sandwich alone I would easily throw out 4 and a half stars, maybe five. But...

1) Sweet potato fries were served with no kind of sauce at all. Dry. They were good enough as sweet potato fries but I have never seen them served without a condiment, usually a creamy honey-mustard sauce. And I am sure they have all the components for a honey mustard dipping sauce on hand, so when we asked the helpful bartender, who listed all the salad dressings twice and then asked the chef and got a \"no\" when there were less than 15 customers in the place....that just looks like purposeful avoidance of effort.

2) Beans and rice - I liked the idea but two things stood out. First, they came to me at a temperature so high that they had to have been microwaved. Well above eating temperature, which I discovered by burning my mouth. And once they were cool enough to eat, the black beans and peppers  and rice had a very weak flavor profile. Kind of sweet, maybe citrus? But insipid and timid, not a bold flavor you would expect from a Caribbean-inspired dish. I could taste the potential of this dish but it wasn't well executed. Adding some sofrito could help a lot.

Now, the green beans were fine and the meats, as mentioned, were top notch as was the sandwich. (And that cornbread!)  But as a diner what I'm likely to remember was that I paid money for food and some of it was really good but some of it was, frankly, wasted. And that's money wasted.

3) When we finished our entrees, we debated dessert there or elsewhere and we wound up ordering chocolate cheesecake and coffee. The chocolate cheesecake was good. But here again we run into the overall execution problem because the coffee was bitter, so bitter that I assume it had been there all day. Also, the coffee was brought to us with no spoons and no sugar, just cream. It was undrinkable and, to their credit, the server took it off our check.

4) Despite the very small number of people in the restaurant, our check was not correct and had to be redone. This baffles me every time it happens; how can we be among so few people in the place and not get a correct check the first time?

I will say that we got pretty good service (despite the check being wrong, and despite the coffee service) but it would have been truly tragic had we not given the number of people there. I would not say don't try this place; like I said the entrees were very good and I think they have great potential to be a truly unique experience - on a previous visit I had a salad and a jerk chicken skewer and both were really good - so this review being two stars is based on this experience alone, which had too many miscues for me to give more than two stars despite their excellent work with the entrees. 

We paid about $58 including two beers and two mixed drinks, dessert and meals for two people, which includes tip. 

I would recommend trying this restaurant, because the meats are very well executed and delicious. None of the other issues with our dinner were major issues, there were just a bunch of them."}
{"text":"The absolute worst dining experience of my life.   A group of ten ladies, with a reservation, arrived at 6:30.  We were the first party in the establishment.  We ordered food at 7:00.   It is 8:40 and three of my companions do not yet have their meals.  Complaints fall on deaf ears.  This was on a Wednesday.  Inexcusable.  Stay away.   Of the meals served they were all wrong.  Raw sweet potato fries; an 8 oz burger was maybe 5 oz.A cold burger. Tacos with beans and rice was a challenge.  Bad. Bad. Bad.  The one star rating is an error.  No stars"}
{"text":"Just say no. Weird server. Awful food. Empty restaurant. Bar is probably fine. Felt like the Twilight Zone."}
{"text":"We had a great meal the one time we ate there - so much homecooked food for the money. 

The live music has been entertaining, dj fun, and the bartender (maybe Scott?) is fantastic. Once, the owner had us all up dancing and then insisted on buying everyone a drink.

Will definitely go back for a taste of country in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"First time we tried Carribean Cowboy after reading up on it in the Royalton paper. Sorry we did not find it sooner. Very nice interior, new décor, in the cowboy/carribean theme. Lots of roomy booths. New woodwork, cool decorations.  We got there early so we were not there for the band or entertainment. But it looks like a perfect spot to meet up with a group of friends for drinks, food and music. It was pleasantly quiet when we were there. 
MANY menu choices. I definitely want to go back to try some other tempting offers. I decided on the salmon, rice and beans, salad and green beans. All came with the meal. Also had a corn muffin which was absolutely delish and homemade, and did not even need butter, Husband got the steak, baked potato, salad, green beans and a beer. You can judge a good restaurant by the salad and dressing. The salad was a mesclun mix, tomato, cucumber, cheese. HOmemade house Italian had a slightly sweet with garlic taste, which I will order again. ALso got the blue cheese dressing on the side which was very good also. Salad was fresh and nicely presented.
Salmon was \"wild\" not farmed which is very important to me and hard to find in restaurants. Done perfectly as was my husband's steak. Green beans were fresh and not overcooked or over buttered, rice and beans had pepper, onions and a carribean jerk \"kick\". Loved it.
We had a friendly server, who was excellent and on the ball. 
She said the half chicken was a great deal and huge. Also recommended the homemade mac and cheese. which was made in different ways. I want to try the mussels next time. 
This place is a hidden gem, has lots of parking, very clean and new.
Varied menu, lots of choices.

I will be returning with family and friends.

I wish this owner the best. This is quality food and not just any old \"slop\" thrown on a plate.
I'm tired of going to places that are below par.

TIP... some items can be a little spicy for some people. If you want it less spicy, I am sure you can tell them to hold the heat (jerk spices).

we were both very happy to have tried this place."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. There was only one waitress who apparently wasn't even supposed to work but all the others called off that night.  The owner called her and asked her if she could work.  She was the only waitress there and had to take care of the bar, the dining room, and the patio.  The owner was there but didnt seem to help at all.  Our salads came out at the same time as the meal.  Some of the food was wrong and it  took long time to come out.  Owner never came over once to apologize.  Waitress did her best but the fault is with the owner.   Will not return!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there three times as my family and I were driving through, and we really liked this place! I thought the food was great and the service was top notch. Additionally, I like that the drinks are varied (key lime pie shot) and priced well. I prefer to support local business's, otherwise we're stuck with Applebee's and Chili's as the only options. I definitely think the Carribean Cowboy has the best food of anywhere in the region, but also a great atmosphere, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Service was ok, food was something not horrible but yet not something i will ever eat again. My stomach and bathroom concur!"}
{"text":"All the signs pointed to no.  Should have listened.  Over priced frozen appetizers for $5 each - same price as box of 24 at grocery store.  Dinner was small portions of bland food with either too much grease or no flavor - don't get that at home!  Spent $70 with tip for 3 meals at a local dump.  Save your money and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I will never go back. My boyfriend and I ordered a margarita with patron for $10. The bill comes and ends up being $14 each drink. We say something to the bar tender. Then he brings the owner over to talk to us and she said they were triple shots (we didn't even order triple shots) and the owner told us \"you didn't notice how strong they were\" HORRIBLE SERVICE"}
{"text":"This is a ONE AND DONE

The burgers weren't cooked correctly, the waitress went to socialize with the guys at the bar and forgot one of meals - we had to ask her for it. My chicken was cold and basically she said \"oh well\". 

I can't believe they are in business still. We should have known since there were zero cars there not to go in

Ugh"}
{"text":"Quick service, but stop ordering after the appetizers. Our server was very attentive (maybe too much, but there weren't many other people in the place). He made suggestions, and talked us out of more expensive options, which was a nice touch. Menu looked appealing, with promises of everything being homemade. The pulled pork potato skin app was tasty. But I'm sorry, our main courses were anything but. My wife ordered NY strip medium rare, and it was way overcooked with no flavor and terrible rice/black beans. I ordered a sampler plate, and didn't really enjoy anything on it other than the huge pile of green beans. The ribs were OK at best, but the beef brisket was awful. My favorite part of the meal was the corn bread.
One other note: this restaurant used to be an Italian place where on weekends a big group of parents and kids would come for a while. It looks like they're still coming. Try to avoid them if possible. The kids run around the restaurant while the parents sit at a separate table drinking.
Place looked promising, and we gave it a shot, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Recently went for lunch with a group of ten people.  One in the group recommended it, but from the moment I pulled into the parking lot I was underwhelmed. 

From the outside, it reminded me of a strip club. We were the only people in the restaurant and were greeted immediately with our friendly server. 

The menu was more extensive than I would have thought, but it was typically bar food. I'm guessing it might get more of a bar crowd than an eating crowd. 

All of us agreed that the food was just OK. Our server was very friendly but not efficient. As I said, we were the only customers and we had to ask where our food was after waiting almost an hour."}
