{"text":"New go to place for coffee meetings.  Staff is great, will bring your order upstairs so you can go get settled.  Breakfast tacos are crazy good.  Will definately look into booking a private event here one day if it comes up.  Only bummer is sometimes its freezing cold in the winter by the big windows."}
{"text":"The coffee is good. WiFi sucks! I come here often because the food and drinks are great but I also come to work. I like to get school work done and I need the WiFi. They are pretty pricy. You 'd think they'd invest in better WiFi. Its a waste of time time. If you are coming to meet with a friend and chat I guess its okay. Students beware, makes more sense to go to Starbucks . at least their WiFi works"}
{"text":"Great food and coffee here.  One of the best in BWV.  Staff is super friendly and everything I've had has been great.  Portion sizes are on the small side, but it's all high quality food.  Prices are reasonable as well.  Go upstairs to eat - great atmosphere and away from the hustle and bustle of the take out counter."}
{"text":"Nice little respite between other coffee shops that are more commercial on either side of the block"}
{"text":"This place was recc by a local for their coffee. All I can say is Ummmm! Their coffee is awesome. I had it with their upside down cupcake (i think it was called that). It looked like a macaroon....so cream cheese frosting in between two round pieces of sturdy cake loaves. It was pretty big. I would pick the traditional cupcake if I had to do it again. Mainly because the cake wasnt very moist or cake like...more bread like. I assume it has to be that way to hold the thick cream cheese in between.
Either way, if you're in the neighbourhood, try it!"}
{"text":"Love love love this cafe!
We usually go to this place a few times a week as its close to our house :)
The menu was recently updated which has been great as everything I have had so far tasted amazing!! 
The staff, food and drinks all get 5 stars from me!
Be sure to check out their upper level-- we hosted our baby shower there and got amazing reviews from all our guests regarding the space, food & service. :)"}
{"text":"This place is so lovely. The breakfast scone is so delicious and filling, you must try it if you're there! The front line staff are kind and quick. They start my mornings off right."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the most fantastic blueberry homemade still warm scone!!!! Perfect way to start the day with their very flavourful latte!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened- and it has only gotten better.Hands down the BEST coffee in West Bloor. Tasty espresso- we like it strong- and the pastries are delish. They offer to warm them up for you and serve them with a side of butter- not just a cube in tin foil.  
Recently they seem to have brought in a \"manager\" type- a young guy that is making sure tables are cleared, offering a second round and making sure things are efficient- this just makes the place even better. A few times we have gone in and had some b*&*chy service from the girls behind the bar-or less than coherent service from the 7am crew that seems a bit tired from the night before... but not since he started. 

Also the upstairs is a hidden jewel on bloor- wont say anymore you have to discover it yourself :).  Keep up the good work Baka!"}
{"text":"My go to place to work on computer, get a salad and coffee. Nice modern place, and a great alternative to Starbucks. The patio is a nice place to work and people watch. The wifi is sketchy if too many ppl using it so beware if wifi is necessary."}
{"text":"This place caters to aging yuppies with too much money, too much free time, and not enough common sense. 

We waited 45 minutes for a $9 turkey sandwich. It was mixed up, unceremoniously wrapped in tinfoil, and came with a side of nothing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my lunch here today! Everything seemed to be made right there (the croutons in my salad seemed fresh-baked?!) and the service was friendly and efficient. The way it's set up makes ordering a little awkward since if you're standing around to look at the menu or waiting to place your order or pay, you're in the space of people eating. However overall the atmosphere seemed very nice. Seemed like more of a good place to get some work done or catch up quietly with one person, rather than come with a group. 

Only complaint food-wise was that I found a small piece of plastic wrap in my cookie       :( oops! However that kind of thing seemed to be an outlier in terms of what to expect from the food there."}
{"text":"Love their espresso based bevs. Good ambiance, baked goods are pretty good as well. Overall, a great little meet up spot in the Village"}
{"text":"Had coffee and tea with quinoa muffin and scone with my friend. Just happened to be in neighbourhood and really glad to find this place. Service was attentive and polite. Upstairs is an airy space with lots of seating. Washrooms were spotless. Can't wait to go back and have one of their sandwiches or pizza."}
{"text":"went there last night to try the pizza & wine...i think the idea is drink lots of wine and then the pizza is not that bad....the margarita pizza was lacking in sauce, cheese and basil.....when the dish washer asked us how our food was we told her and she chased down a server and there was no acknowledgment, a half hearted  apology....staff does not know how to deal with customers.....great location with great patio but if you serve mediocre food there are other options......"}
{"text":"Cute patio and fresh crepes you can watch being made. Nice patries and cold press juices. They serve alcohol so if it's that kinda Saturday morning, you can add a baileys shot to your latte. Cozy but extra seating upstairs perfect for doing some reading."}
{"text":"Amazing food and  the best coffee. This worth the stop if your in the area. You have to come out and see the live bands during open mic night."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe with a modern atmosphere. Their upper floor us used for meet up groups and is a great space for people to relax or do some work.

The food is quite good too. Delicious paninis and baked goods. Pay at the cash and they servers will come look for you if you decide to sit outside in the patio or upstairs where there's extra seating. 

Connected to a Bell store and not totally obvious where this place is from Bloor, so look out for Bell. This place is just a round the corner."}
{"text":"Our go to neighborhood café with a cool Croatian feel with great staff. You can go for light breakfast, lunch (great soup and sandwiches, I usually take the combo), or simply for a good coffee. They have a very nice terrace in the summer.
We usually go there on weekly basis!"}
{"text":"It was $9 for a chai latte and a dry peanut butter banana muffin mmmm it was so dry that it made my throat hurt so badly ugh I'll definitely be back!! 
 
Oh and my friend got food poisoning after eating here...he ordered a grilled cheese. A sandwich and an illness...what a steal! 

For all of you out there who love overpriced baked goods and food poisoning, this is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"Great café and very elegant interior, an ideal place to have coffee or a brunch, their breakfast menu is excellent. The spinach wrap was delicious, and had a good amount of scrumbled egg, spinach and cheese inside - filling and at a very good price!!"}
{"text":"These guys value their customers.  BEST service and the food/drinks are great too.  We discovered this place at the beginning of the summer and drop by for brunch as often as possible.  THANK YOU for letting our little dog sit with us on the patio.  

The young man who works here is awesome and friendly.  Small touches make such a difference and have made us customers for as long as you stay open!

Wish other places were like you guys!"}
{"text":"friendly and helpful staff. Coffee is a few steps better than Starbucks but falls short to most dedicated espresso bars.  The beans are burnt obviously because they've immersed the grounds with boiling water without waiting for the cool down.  At least it tastes that way.

Variety of fun pastries with ample  seating inside and out.  Great spot to people watch.  

Note: I'm very picky with Coffee, so take my rating as a very conservative one."}
{"text":"Average food, below average service.

Had brunch here on Sunday. They have a very nice menu, but after reading it all and making our selections, we were told that most of the menu isn't available for breakfast or lunch on Sunday. Maybe they could have told us that when we sat down. Not very friendly staff, not even a hello when we entered the restaurant.

The food itself was mostly meh other than the French toast and bacon which was reasonably good. We asked for some water and got a glass a little larger than a shot glass. Well, it was good humour value anyhow. 

The dessert crepe was a sad waste of carbs. Nut cluster means a handful of crushed walnuts. I'm not sure why something so sweet would be paired with nature's most bitter nut. But there it is, even dessert was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Very artistic cafe shop, owner is a wildlife photographer, the internal decorates his work- amazing! We ordered cortado and macchiato, they were perfect! Service was excellent, great place."}
{"text":"Baka is one of my regular weekend stops. Coffee is good and even great when the foam swirls are cleverly and artistically crafted - they all try, but some of the baristas are better at their craft. I recommend the scones with a nice variety of sweet and savoury to try.  They have a short but interesting menu, and a nice simple Sunday brunch.  When not in a hurry we venture upstairs to a good space for a casual sit.  Otherwise the tables downstairs (or on the patio in warmer weather) are a great option, if you're staying in."}
{"text":"This place can offer you great lunch and pastries. Customer service is good and the decoration in the second floor is stunning. Perfect for a meeting around a coffee and work on your laptop."}
{"text":"Really good food and coffees...open mic night on Friday night was a wonderful surprise...cosy and modern atmosphere. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"i love baka! such a great environment and AMAZING coffee! iced lattes are always my go to and are so refreshing! definitely worth checking out! 5 stars for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Baka café for sometime, probably twice a week for over a year, but have recently decided to go elsewhere for a few reasons. (We usually have a group of 5-8 people and will sit on the Baka patio during the summer months)

My wife is a tea drinker and earlier this year Baka had changed the brand of tea they are serving.  My wife asked about the change of brands to the server and my wife was given a curt and snippy retort.

Recently, my wife and I were running errands in the neighbourhood and we were feeling like a snack so we were looking for options and remembered Baka had a Friday evening promotion Pizza & Wine.

The patio was full, so I went in to order while my wife waited for a table.

While ordering, I didn't see any signs about the promotion, and when I went to order I asked about the pizza options.  The server pointed to the menu and said those are the options. So I ordered our food and went outside to join my wife.

While waiting for our food, my wife asked about the wine, I told her the promo must have ended because there was no-signage.

So, we sat at our table and waited for our pizza, and when it arrived, my wife asked about the promotion. And the server came back with a snippy retort.

The food is tasty, but its the service that has been our spoiling our recent visits.  

There are many options around. We have started going to another café for our weekend morning routine."}
{"text":"Good food, good coffee, good work atmosphere. But the WORST internet you could probably find at a coffee shop in Toronto. Hands down. Before the downstairs was converted into seating and their Bell store was there, internet was tolerable (still not great). 

Now the internet is 5x worse then dial up. Which is a shame, as i'd come here to work far, far more often. Cherry on top, they don't allow access to Dropbox (which I can live without).

So if you're looking for a cafe to work at, 100% skip over this place. You'll spend the majority of the time waiting for a basic web page to load."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add that they have a lovely patio in the summers and they've started serving chocolate cupcakes :)"}
{"text":"The place has very cool features like outdoor sitting area, 2 bright and beautiful sitting floors, daily menu, and alcohol which gives option to every taste. The place is very convenient with lots of street parking and subway station. Still a lot to enjoy so will go here again."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. Their coffee is amazing. And their breakfast bagel with house-made fennel sausage is delicious and really good value for a place of this quality. I've been here several times but sadly never seen the actual \"gallery\" part of enjoyed things like a wine and pizza special they had at some point.

My only qualm is that it's a very small place and ordering/getting a table can sometimes feel hectic. But this is just nitpicking."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, but they have been cheaping out on the small things lately, which takes away from the experience. Charging extra for jam and no longer including fruit with $11.25 french toast?! Really? On top of that, service is painfully slow. Rarely get acknowledged. As of today, no longer giving this place my business. Treat your customers better and don't be so cheap!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it opened and there is much to like about it. There is outdoor seating, seasonal menus and pretty good lattes. However, the staff need to learn that insensitively loud stacking of China and loud rock and roll music doesn't make for a very pleasant ambience."}
{"text":"Really, really great coffee *and* you can almost always get a seat upstairs. 

The staff is friendly and quick. No fuss, either. 

Frankly, the only downside is the elderly people who colonize the top floor and talk too loud. 

A superior option to the Starbucks at Runnymede and overall: it is the best coffee in Bloor West. I recommend Baka to a lot of folks."}
{"text":"Good coffee and baked goods, nice atmosphere with cool furniture, large place and nice upstairs.  Good for holding small gatherings or events on the second floor.  Happy to have such nice eclectic places pop up in Toronto."}
{"text":"It has become a go-to spot in the Bloor West Village. I always get a latte when I'm here. Since the weather has become sunnier, it's super nice to sit outside on their patio and enjoy. It is a little small, and I have only ever been during the day, so not too familiar with the premises of upstairs. 

Staff is super friendly, and the environment is warm and inviting. Endless baked goods to choose from, and the food on the menu is refreshing and healthy."}
{"text":"We love hanging out at this place. Good patio and decent food. Some days, service is slow but servers are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hi, this is one of my favourite coffee shops in the Bloor West area. When I'm in the city I go at least three times a week. But today I go only to find that my usual coffee and muffin cost more than $7...too much!  Overnight it seems that the price has increased by at least 10%. It's now about twice the cost of the Tim's down the street. Is it worth it???"}
{"text":"Great cafe located in Bloor-West Village.  Stopped for a quick bite to eat and had chive-prosciutto scones and a latte, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Decent cross between a coffee shop and trendy bar. Generally average, nothing too bad, but not spectacular either.

Bit pricey for what it is but the location is good."}
{"text":"Wanted to try Baka on my morning walk. Nice menu. Nice place. Placed my order, but couldn't pay 'cause they don't accept tap. I'm now fully mobile with Googlepay and RBC wallet. They just lost my business. Woulda spent 12 bucks.   Ps) my favourite coffee place a few blocks away (Coffee Tree) even has tap. :-). I'm biased but mobile payment is table stakes now for business ..."}
{"text":"I ordered the chai tai and tuna wrap and was not disappointed with my decision. Altogether $12. Came during a weekday afternoon and it was quiet. Wifi was fast. Friendly service. Overall a great first impression. 

All different types of people. Business professionals, older folks. Music isn't too loud and tons of space on the second floor. I am currently working on the second floor and wifi is just as strong. Really happy with this discovery."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, pastries and soups. The sandwiches are so so. 
The atmosphere is pleasant. We're there every week. Our favorite place."}
{"text":"Went here for a pizza and wine night. The cost was good but the pizza mediocre. It looked like someone spilled flour on it. Not sprinkled, spilled. We sat upstairs and the tables were all dirty. I had to wipe down the table before we sat down with a wet paper towel and this was after we picked the cleanest table... They have a good Croatian beer and a decent wine selection. Also attended a paint night here but decided to not get food."}
{"text":"Had a quick coffee meet up with fellow Yelper Teresa H over the weekend. We were looking for a new coffee place in Bloor West Village since we were tired of the typical Starbucks in the area. We decided on Baka since its been on my radar for awhile. Baka is off of Bloor St. West of Runnymede. The store itself was tiny but they had their patio open (thank goodness because weather was gorgeous) and they have seating upstairs which I didn't see.

I give it a solid 4/5, I had a vanilla latte with a chocolate croissant. The Latte was good. Espresso was nice and smooth, not too acidic for me. Vanilla wasn't too sweet and overpowering. Just a good amount. The croissant I would ask to heat up next time as I prefer it a little softer as it probably gets dry in the food case."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed this place as a lunch stop a few times. We love the art gallery feel with white walls. Great sandwiches and coffee. Oh yes the soup us excellent."}
{"text":"It's my first time coming to this place and brunch time is usually busy. Night time the upstairs lounge is open for seating with more upbeat music and alcohol and more substantial food being served. There's also interesting at which changes and can be purchased if you see one that you like.
If you're there in the morning or brunch, there's still plenty of variety from the menu and their baked goods to choose from. Loved their everything bagel with sausage, yummy and decently priced. It just might be hard to get a seat if you come at the busy hours. Plus, it's right next to Zaza if you can't hey coffee here, you can always head over to Zaza Espresso."}
{"text":"Excellent café! Good prices and great service. We were greeted kindly and not pushed for an order (Which happens a lot to me since I take way too long on decision making - but I always appreciate patience when it occurs.) When I asked which soup she preferred I was offered samples of both, extra points. The soups are made in house (score!) that day they had pear & squash which was light and refreshing although a bit thin, plus a bacon brisket which was salty but had nice big tender chunks of both meats. 

We went for a Ruben with pear and squash soup side for $14. Both were brought to our table promptly, the sandwiches are made and pressed to order and had a nice balance of toppings. Downside being the bread was boring and the sandwich wasn't heated through as the meat still had a chill to it.

Cappuccino was above average, although the espresso lacked character the milk was frothed perfectly. It was served wet (the way I like it) unfortunately without latte art (lazy pour or maybe it was abstract.) My friend had a vanilla latte which had a perfect level of vanilla. 

I didn't try any baked goods, though it looks like they have a few made-in-house offerings and the rest are from circles and squares (which is excellent stuff). I have pretty high standards for café's since I work at one, but these guys are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Long wait to get served. Many of the wait staff are dismissive. 

The food is pretty good at a reasonable price. 

They have increased the space which adds for comfort. 

Very clean environment. 

Outdoor patio is extremely basic but they have one."}
{"text":"Fantastic new spot in BWV. We will be going back there frequently. Nice and spacious. Lots of seating, bright and new. Staff is very courteous. Chill atmosphere - ie: ot as \"loud and annoying\" as ZaZa and their patrons lol"}
{"text":"Another total (happy) accident, finding this place. I was around the corner at the NB store buying shoe laces and stopped in for a coffee on the way back to Green P to get my car, for no reason other than I happened to be walking by and was curious about the decor. Now, I drink a lot of coffee, and this city has come a long way when it comes to wonderful coffee in recent times, but the Americano I had at Baka blew me away. I started giggling with pleasure and surprise on the sidewalk outside, it was that good. I also took a chance on one of their French macarons because I wanted something small, sweet and flour-free to enjoy with my coffee. I got the salted caramel, and it too was unreal, so delicious. Put the two together, the macaron and the coffee... Bliss. The staff were busy but helpful and good, and the vibe was comfortable in spite of the bright white space. I'll definitely come back with friends for a leisurely coffee break sometime soon. If you're nearby, go! Get a coffee at this little gem, you won't be sorry. Promise."}
