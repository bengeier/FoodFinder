{"text":"Was in Phoenix for business and discovered this friendly, wonderful  haunt  near the airport.  I had the best lunch ever -  a Southwestern chicken chipotle panini.  OMG!  The guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned East coast deli.    I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience!  I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin.    My  client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix!  I can't wait to share the secret!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon the Lunch Lounge while staying at the Aloft last week, and was thrilled that I did. It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that. Wish we had more deli-type places like this in Milwaukee! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! My wife and I had two sandwiches and shared halves; one was my wife's choice and the other was at the suggestion of the guy working the counter. Both were a satisfying and worth going out of our way for. Definitely going to visit next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"an excellent place for lunch, the food is great the service too! always friendly, never pushy, as one guy said, i like the 'tude of the lounge lady...i call it the the lunch lizard and its off the beaten path but you wont go wrong with thier specials or anything on the menu for that matter. the outside seating is nice, i try to eat here regularly...beats any chain sammich shop!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Wasn't expecting much from a deli sandwiched between office buildings, but wow! This place is just across the street from where I work and everyone is blown away by the food. The staff is super friendly and the food is really fresh. The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer."}
{"text":"First time for breakfast. Waiting for someone at sky harbor. Breakfast burrito outstanding. A meal in a tortilla. Very tasty and really inexpensive. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The sandwich I ordered was pretty good.  Only problem was that it wasn't what I ordered and I'm not really sure which sandwich I got.  I ordered the southwest chicken chipotle, but the sandwich I got had cheddar cheese (not pepper jack), bacon, green chilies and tomato.  No chicken and I don't think it had chipotle mayo either.  I took it to go, so couldn't ask them to redo it, and was kinda disappointed I didn't get chicken.  I likely got overcharged as well since it didn't have any meat on it besides the bacon.  I'll try again sometime and hopefully end up with the correct order."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! In fact, probably my favorite sandwich spot. A hidden gem. I eat here atlas once a week. I have yet to have one bad thing.  My favorite sandwiches are the Queen of Clubs ( like the King of clubs, but with only a double decker not a triple decker) and the tuna melt. The cobb and garden of eden salad are my favorites. Their sandwiches and salads are pretty big, so go with an appetite. Its a mom and pop sandwich shop, which I love. Try it out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal.  Very willing to make adjustments and recommendations. Would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Very close to work but only found out about it through yelp. My sandwich was delicious and the staff was super friendly.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good, fresh stuff. They were flexible as far as adding and removing desired ingredients. Friendly staff. Seems like a hit for locals at lunch."}
{"text":"If you work in the area and have not been here, GO IMMEDIATELY!  I have worked across the street for 15 years and I am so thrilled to finally have good food in the area.  The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area. Fast service, wifi on site, nice staff...I seriously cannot say anything negative.  Thank you for saving our lunch dilemma in the area!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week all of their sandwiches and salads are always fresh and delicious and every 9 salads or sandwiches you buy you get the 10th on FREE. Goodstuff! Glad it's near my work."}
{"text":"Happy to have found this place! Great food, decent prices, friendly staff. This makes me a more-than-once-a-week patron! And they will even accomodate an off-menu request as long as they have the ingredients. Thanks, Fred!"}
{"text":"What a find!  While staying at the Aloft in Phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk.     We had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini.  Both were excellent!  The burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both.  The lunch menu looked great and I would like to try some of the sandwiches.  We are here for a few more days and will eat here on Monday.  If you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food at a small lunch restaurant,  it is a good place to pick up lunch if in the area but it is not a destination lunch spot. More of a business man's quick stop."}
{"text":"I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work."}
{"text":"What a find, right behind the Radisson, fresh cheap and delicious.  Friendly staff. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Weekly specials are amazing.  Great, fast, and friendly service.  I'd highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick breakfast, and were delighted to find this spot just out the back door and across the parking lot of the Radisson. The staff was friendly and accommodating when my husband asked for his breakfast sandwich to be deconstructed into toast, eggs & bacon. I enjoyed the low-carb scramble. Exactly what we needed before heading to the airport. Good coffee, too."}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find. But I like how it's a hole in the wall great service and great food ! If you're in the area be sure to stop by !"}
{"text":"I have been to the Lunch Lounge many times for lunch and love the chicken salad.  It is the best!  I also love the BLT's.  Today I stopped in for breakfast and had the breakfast panini sandwich and I am once again impressed.  Thank you Lunch Lounge!!!"}
{"text":"The Lunch Lounge is absolutely delicious and fresh! Everyone is always there with a smile on their faces serving up yummy sandwiches, wraps, and salads. I haven't had one thing on the menu that I have not enjoyed. It is the perfect mom n pop shop of a deli!"}
{"text":"Food was OUTSTANDING!! Definitely going back to try the peanut butter, bacon, Nutella, and banana ego sandwich"}
{"text":"Awesome find! Stopped in for breakfast on the run and will probably come back for lunch. The guys are super nice... Coffee is amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't figure out why their food isn't that great. They seem to use good quality products. Been there for breakfast and lunch and its meh."}
{"text":"Great little local place with tasty food.  Be diligent in finding it as it isn't obvious from the main street.  Minimal seating for eat-in so plan ahead.  Friendly staff, good prices."}
{"text":"This is not a full service restaurant. You order at counter and pick up at counter and seat yourself. It is a quick, in an out, kind of place.  They had fresh salads and sandwiches.  The prices were reasonable and the portions were decent.  The service was very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot!  Fresh food.  Something for everybody.  Long line at lunch though.  We had our food within 15/20 minutes from the line at the door."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant and fast service with good prices and great sandwiches, coffee, and burritos"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop tucked into the office plaza (Follow the sandwich board signs to find it). I had the lunch roast beef special and it was really good. The red potato salad seemed to be missing something for my palate, but over all it was really good! Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces.   Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another.  Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. The location is a little hidden. It's in an office building. There is shaded outside seating. The food was fresh and my sandwich tasted great. My only complaint was that the potato salad had too much dill in it."}
{"text":"Simple but Exquisite. Breakfast Sandwiches are AMAZING GOOD  Bacon  is always Crispy. I have been a couple of times but it has exceeded my expectations. It's so Fucking Good and service is quick and good. So go there and visit them"}
{"text":"Food is good and location is convenient. Service is terrible - even the owner - the older woman acts like its an inconvenience to help people. We have had the opportunity to give her more business but decided against it because of the service. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is a one-of-a-kind place that's out of the way but then again it's hitting gym right here on 44th to South Van Buren got to come and check out their breakfast specials lunch specials.   They close early so you got to get there real early they have eclectic menu with a lot of things on it and even if you suggest some things they'll make it directly for you without charge you an arm and a leg everything here is good.  Please make sure you stop at the lunch Lounge morning or afternoon grab you something good they also have good teas coffees & smoothies just a select things that you can pick up here awesome plays can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"This place is literally down the street from where I work, so it's very convenient for me. It's tucked away under one of the office buildings. Their sandwiches and salads are on the expensive side, but they also have fairly large portion sizes, so I guess that evens out. The ingredients are good quality, and their bacon is freshly made (you can smell it when walking in). My favorite is their southwest chipotle chicken panini. Haven't tried most of the other selections because I'm not a fan of deli meats or cold sandwiches (makes my lunch choices easy!), but I'm assuming they are good."}
{"text":"Tucked in behind the Radisson at the corner of an office park, this is a great alternative to the food in the local hotels.  I had the Cobb salad. Despite the generic iceberg lettuce it was enhanced with fresh spinach, avocado and egg and everything else was fresh. Good dressing and generous portions.  As others have said come before noon or after 1 o'clock if you don't want to wait in line. Three nice tables outside with a little lawn view."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's quick and convenient and within walking distance from work so I visit quite often. I like building my own sandwich, the lettuce is shredded and the meat is sliced very thin just as I like it! Everything is really fresh. I often get the garden salad (entrée size) and the lettuce is always SO crisp and they aren't stingy with toppings. I've also gotten the BLT and it's one of the best I've had, and loaded with perfectly-cooked bacon. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the chicken when I got it once. Everyone there is so friendly, especially the owner. Today I went in with a  couple of co-workers and we saw a crazy special on the menu--bacon, peanut butter, Nutella, and bananas on Eggo waffles! Looked weird to us, but the owner made us one to try free of charge. So unexpected and kind, and whatdayaknow...it was delish!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fast.  They primarily serve the corporate crowd so keep that in mind if you visit during prime lunch hours."}
{"text":"We spent the morning at the Phoenix Zoo and wanted to grab something quick for lunch before heading back to our house in Mesa. It seems to cater to the business crowd in the surrounding office buildings, but the ramp made parking very convenient and I'd encourage anyone to check it out. All five of us enjoyed our sandwiches. I had the Italian, and was amazed how many ingredients and flavors they were able to squeeze in without making it a fall-apart mess. Seemed to be the consensus at the table. You could definitely tell the side of potato salad was fresh. It was a little drier than most, but still had good flavor with a touch of dill. The service was friendly and fast. We sat outside and when our order was up a staff member was quick to deliver it right to our table. The Lunch Lounge turned out to be exactly what we were looking for! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got the southwest chipotle chicken panini and it was good but not great. It also cost $7.99+ tax which is too expensive for a sandwich with no sides or drinks. I would come here again if a friend wanted to eat here but i wont come back again on my own accord."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop near my office within walking distance.  Good variety, tasty food and daily specials (love the chicken salad).  Staff is very friendly and service is quick.  I recommend Lunch Lounge to all visitors that come to my office."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, I had Pastrami, the best sandwich I have had in a long time..they get it right, and very fast. Definitely will return.  Outstanding Sandwiches, Betty"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..  Finally she said \"whenever your ready..\". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses.   As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude!   The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars.   The food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop. I haven't had pastrami like this since my last trip to NY. And the bread! Yum!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last Friday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast burrito. The service was fast, and not only was the breakfast burrito reasonably priced, but it was also enormous."}
{"text":"The food was definitely solid but what stood out the most for me was the friendly staff and the iced coffee they whipped up. Wish I had got their largest size. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"i am not a fan of turkey so when i asked the sandwich guy for his recommendation, and he suggested the albuquerque turkey, i was unsure, nevetheless i went on to try it and boy! Was i glad? The sandwich comes with   fresh cole slawish salad, bacon cooked just right crisp and retaining its flavor, generous slice of turkey and to top it off chile mayo which is really what separates  this sandwich from the other diners... .all in all a great sandwich...made to perfection. I want to come here and try other items on the menu... They all look good....hopefully on my next trip to phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch.  Fresh Boars Head meats. Fresh bread (marble rye is awesome) and tr staff is great.  One of the best sandwiches in the Phoenix area.  Don't miss this place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a very boring looking business park, you can sneak in for a great sandwich. Go around the corner and look for the Boar's Head sign. I had the Thanksgiving lunch special - turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, and I held off on the cheese. Nicely toasted bread - all in all, a decent lunch!"}
{"text":"Only open for lunch spot, a nice little sandwich shop hidden behind the Radisson. I had the Grilled Fiesta Chicken Wrap and really enjoyed it. Pretty large sandwiches from what I can tell and looking forward to trying other options, as well. Being from out of town, you can tell it has its regulars and people really like this lunch place."}
{"text":"I'm in town and this place was right next to my hotel. I had the Albuquerque turkey sandwich on sour dough at the recommendation of the server. It was AMAZING! The avocado was freshly cut and tasted great. I was sad when I took my last bite. lol"}
{"text":"This place is located in a prime spot for travelers as well as office workers.  The menu is a diverse and creative mix on standard lunch box fare.  Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch.  I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch.  The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning."}
{"text":"A really good sandwich place. It's location is a little unusual but very convenient to the surrounding airport hotels. The turkey, avocado bot was great."}
{"text":"It is hard to locate but just look for a small sign stating there are just hiding in the back! (: The set up is nice with an option to eat indoors/outdoors although I wouldn't recommend bringing large parties. Customer service was good and the food was delicious! I had to go with the BLT which, they did not shy away with the bacon. I wouldn't mind visiting back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Good food for lunch, fresh sandwich.  Everyone was pleased with their selection.  Only problem is seating is limited and we had 6 of us. Luckily it was nice outside."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here one day because I was on that part of town and I was not disappointed at all! This little place caters to the business in the area and the hotel that it is next to but the food and prices were very good. The service was great as well. Anything you order you will not be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Tasty selection of sandwiches served by personable, friendly folks that have great personalities and obviously care about their food and customers.   Only thing that would have improved my meal was a pepper shaker to flavor up my sandwich ."}
{"text":"Restaurant/Ambiance: Small cafe tucked away in a corporate office park. Has a Modern but relaxed cafe vibe inside. Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.  Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.  Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.  Overall: Great little lunch cafe!"}
{"text":"I had the Toasty breakfast sandwich, sooooo good. It comes with eggs, bacon and chesse and a toasted bagel."}
{"text":"I have visited The Lunch Lounge 3 times since one of their workers stopped by my office and dropped off a menu and some yummy cookies. The first time I wasn't sure what to expect so I got a Ceasar Salad hold the Ceasar please. It was okay, the chicken was good and none of the leafy greens were in bad condition. I guess I was expecting a wow factor when it came to the $6 salad I had received. they do brew Starbucks so I had decided to get one of my favorites. Hazelnut latte... only they were out of the Hazelnut Syrup. I instead got a caramel latte. Not my favorite, but it would do.  My second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.  Today I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich \"your way\" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread...   To say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's"}
{"text":"I picked this spot out because of Yelp. I was looking to walk from my hotel (Aloft) and it's just down the street. Pay attentuon to the signs. It's in the back of a building that blends in with the rest. I had a Cobb salad and it was fresh and ready in about 3 minutes. Seemed like good friendly sevice. Portion was perfect and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Just paid my first visit to this place and I will definitely be back.  I tried the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and my co-worker had the Hot Roast Beef Press.  Both were good choices, but seeing how happy she was with her choice I have to come back to try that one next.  Plenty of off-street parking.  I only wish this place was open on weekends (although given their location I can understand why they are not).  Maybe open a second location near the business park at University and Elwood (hint, hint)?  I'm pretty sure it would be a big hit."}
{"text":"I had the Egg-Cellent Burrito. Its name is not representative of the taste. It indeed did have eggs, but not the greatest tasting. They pulled the burrito out of the microwave so I assume that's how they cook it. I'd recommend checking something else out next time."}
{"text":"Today I had the hot pastrami with on the side. The sandwich and the slaw: EXCELLENT!  The staff is great. I'm flying today so I also purchased a pb&j on grain bread for later.   I'm sure it will be awesome too."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop near several airport hotels. They also serve salads at lunchtime, and breakfast starting at 7:00 AM. Alas, wasn't in town long enough to sample the breakfast, but lunch was fantastic. Small but very popular at lunch when I was there"}
{"text":"Hidden cafe with outside seating.    Don't let the name fool you...they also serve breakfast.   Great prices including my 1$ coffee!"}
{"text":"They can make just about anything to  match your taste buds, but let me say, there's almost nothing better than their Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini!"}
{"text":"Needed to find a quick easily accessible place for my kids and myself to eat and this place was in walking distance right behind Radisson hotel where we're staying at. Was able to find something for all of us. Pb&j's for the kids and a hot pastrami for me. Both were delicious and the staff was friendly. Quick, easy and much healthier than the fast food chains. Would of course recommended and return to the lunch lounge. Might actually get me some coffee there tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"It's the best little cafe type place around. Have tried both the breakfast panini which was delicious and fresh. And also the California club sandwich which was a legit size for the price and very good as well. Luckily I can walk across from my office and enjoy."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for lunch because of a Groupon \"now deal\". So glad I did. I apparently beat the rush too. It was surprisingly easy to find, and the staff was super nice.  I created my own press sandwich, and it was delicious if i do say so myself. The selection is really good, and the prices are decent. W/ my Groupon I basically paid half price for my meal.   The perfect hidden lunch spot."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Quick and easy! I got the big toasty and added avocado and it was a great way to start the morning. Staff was a little awkward, would have liked a little more help with menu seeing as it was out first time there. But still will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent little hidden spot. Great menu with fair prices. Had the Breakfast burrito with a cup of coffee. Outstanding burrito! Loads of cheese & stuffings. The menu on yelp is a little outdated but the prices are more than reasonable. Definetly give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great breakfast panini for $5. More affordable than a breakfast or brunch chain for sure. Nothing for breakfast is over $5 which makes this a spot I will recommend and more than likely come back to next trip. Iced coffee is only $1 till 11 and breakfast is served til 11."}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options.  I got a vegetarian sandwich on their 9 inch sub roll.   Very soft bread that was tasty.  Your choice of cheeses and veggies. I got pepper jack and all the veggies.  Very well done.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great service in a quick-bite-to-eat, make-your-own-sandwich spot. Most of the business probably wanders from those office buildings. People looked lost and in their own heads as they would methodically make their way. It is a sunny day at 74° but it's clear that's it's Friday at the office. Anyway back to the food- Choices for breads cheese meats veggies Chips and soda  Pretty standard with more selections available too  Sandwich was well prepared and tasted as expected.  Note: Almost gave them four stars because the cashier is a Colts fan but we all make choices and their good service and food shouldn't suffer from his choice to root for the Colts. I joke, I joke. Also, Go Patriots. :)"}
{"text":"SImple to find and great custom made food. Sandwiches, Chips and Drink. No frills but delicious."}
{"text":"Found this tucked away casual lunch restaurant by YELP while we were traveling. They have lots of sandwich and salad options at reasonable prices.  Service is quick and friendly.  Very clean, including the restroom. Sign in restroom instructs staff to wash up to the elbows with antibacterial soap!  Someone in charge must have background in nursing or medicine!    We ordered a hot pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and a chicken breast with bacon ranch salad.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"A hidden breakfast and lunch spot. It lost stars for being a little challenging to find and not having ample seating. We ordered the chicken Caesar salad and Cobb salad- both tasted great. They give a full sliced chicken breast as the protein, which I appreciated. They have about 10 sandwich options and 6 salad choices. They also have 8-10 breakfast choices. You'll spend $4-8 on breakfast and $7-12 for lunch depending on your preferences. They did have a short 'lower priced list' if you're on a smaller budget."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich luncheon spot!  The Albuquerque Turkey Panini is fantastic!  Green chili mayo?  Who knew?  I had to buy some to go!  Fresh vegetables and Boar's head meat. Warning if you order a cold sub sandwich the bread is a bit too much.  It's loaded with goodies but it's too much bread."}
{"text":"Yum! Good food and they deliver on Amazon Restaurants! I will certainly be ordering again. I was particularly happy with the carb free option for breakfast. We had a happy breakfast crowd."}
{"text":"Worth finding - a little awkward the first time, but I don't regret having to drive the block an extra time! The Italian sub was loaded with meat - just like back home (Boston) - salad was fresh, bread was fresh, meat was just YUMMY!! Nice surprise - we will all be back. BTW - lunch for 4 + drinks was $30.00 ... Great, clean, fresh and friendly!!"}
{"text":"This deli has good food but they are very high priced.  They have long waits at lunch time and the phone is usually busy.  I asked what the price was for a Ceasar Salad without the chicken and was told 5 bucks but when I went to pick up she told me the full price I told her I was told $5 and she did not honor it she said they won't make any money that way.  So be prepared if you have a complaint."}
{"text":"After arriving at PHX airport we searched for a nearby lunch option and this was well reviewed.  It was a little difficult to find.  It's hidden in a larger building with very little signage.  Also the parking lot has signs about hotel guests only etc.. so that was a little unnerving.  They were closing soon when we came in, but we ordered a BLT and a southwest chicken panini.  Both were ready quickly and were very good."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a good sandwich. Found lunch lounge a few months ago, and it has become a regular choice for our company Friday lunches. hot pastrami, turkey panini, and the blt are a few of my favorites."}
{"text":"Cool spot! I live in North Scottsdale and I'm not in this area often but I decided to try this place after seeing great reviews. I came during lunch time and it wasn't too busy, to my surprise.  Tried the hot pastrami with melty Swiss and cole slaw on top and it was amaaaazing. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and it was still frozen in the middle.  FROZEN! I couldn't believe it; it took them a long time to have my order ready but still manage to not cook it all the way.  I didn't realize it was frozen until I got back to work to eat it.  By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one.  This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only.  My Panini alone was over $8 after tax.  Not a good value because it doesn't even come with a drink or side.  I appreciate and support local businesses whenever possible but after this mishap, I won't be back."}
{"text":"For a little sandwich shop in an office park, this place is great.   Delicious, big breakfast burrito.  No problem to substitute avocado for the meat. Hot tasty coffee. friendly staff. Outdoor seating option.  All for under $6.  So glad I didn't have the more expensive breakfast in my corporate airport hotel."}
{"text":"Needed to get out of the office . . . so I decided to give this place a try for lunch . . . and I was glad I did.  I ordered the Italian Lover and mad it a meal with Red Potato Salad and a Drink.  The sandwich was wonderful . . . although, I seem to burp red onions the rest of the day . . . not a bad thing, since it reminded me how good the sandwich was.  The potato salad was good . . . the portion was way too small for a side though . . . and I never, ever tell anyone how to cook . . . but if they added some dill to the potato salad it would be to die for.  The reason for only 4 stars . . . the size of the side and drink to make it a meal was in my mind way too expensive and too small.  But to be honest . . . I will definately be back . . . and I will probaly make it a meal . . . just with a different side."}
{"text":"I work in a office building right around the corner from them.  The place is small, but once you find it, you'll keep coming back.  Honest to God, the food is addictive.  My faves are the Italian Hoagie (reminds me of home back East) and the Chipotle Chicken sandwich.  And I also enjoy their flavored iced tea to go along with it.  Staff is friendly too which makes the experience even better!  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"First place I have eaten in Phoenix,being from the East Coast. Wife and I had the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken wrap. Both were excellent and we had a tough time picking the best. Service was friendly and efficient. Even enjoyed the ice tea!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and I was staying at the hotel that is right next door to this place. So I tired the place out for lunch while I was there and the food and atmosphere was just great.   The menu was very simple and straightforward so it was easy to find something and order. The staff were nice and I didn't even notice the wait with how quickly they had made my sandwich. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food near the airport.  I stayed at the Radisson near the Phoenix airport for a couple nights and ate at this place twice during my stay.   On the first day, I checked in around 2pm and wanted food right away without going far. Found this place on yelp and gave it a chance. Was going to order a chicken sandwich but the lady who rang me up recommended the turkey wrap. I'm always up for trying recommendations at new places so I got the turkey wrap of the day and man was it tasty. I thought it was quite pricy for just a wrap but price of lunch was worth the taste of the dish.  On my last day, I stopped again for breakfast and got the eggs-celent burrito with bacon, red onion and salsa. I would definitely order this for breakfast if I was here another morning because breakfast is super cheap! Very filling burrito with a large (and tasty) coffee for around $6.  Also, it's worth mentioning that the service here was great. I read one review here that the lady at the counter was rude but I liked her personality. I don't care for the whole \"how is your day, sir? What can I get started for you?\" The menu is on the wall and if you look uncertain, she will gladly recommend an item. When my food was ready, she handed me my to-go bag and said \"thanks Cesar, have a good one.\" She paid attention to my name on my credit card and remembered it until I left the restaurant to say thanks. That added to the experience here definitely. Nice friendly people working here and if I'm ever on the Phoenix area again, I will definitely stop by for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich. I love having my lunch here. I usually buy Veggie Sandwich and I ask them to grill it. Tastes really good and affordable too."}
{"text":"Love love love their Cali club. Pesto and potato salads are good. They're really fast and super nice. The place is clean and the deli meats and veggies are fresh.  I'm not crazy about their salads but never disappointed in the sandwiches"}
