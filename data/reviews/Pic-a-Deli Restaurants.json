{"text":"We ordered chicken parm and pasta for our team twice in 2 days...that's how pleased we were with the food and service we got from Faye and her staff.  Would definitely recommend their catering service to other groups looking for good affordable food!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for quite some time and is located just steps from our dog groomer. So despite seeing and driving by it for years.....I popped in one day to grab a bite while our dog got groomed.  A great find. They offer standard ' family restaurant ' fare at very reasonable prices. But their breakfasts are amazing - a real ' home cookin'  taste to the breakfasts with huge portions. So, when it's time for the dog to get groomed, while waiting, I always make it into Pic -A -Deli for breakfasts and have never been disappointed.  And, given the owner is Italian, it was good to see that they offer a full pizza take-out ( eat in as well ) menu / service. While I tend to patronize other locations for pizza while in Oakville, I've tried  their pizza ( I ask for extra sauce and thick crust ) a few times over the years, and it's much better than anything you'd find at a big pizza chain. In fact, one or 2 of the guys I play cards with will only order pizza from  Pic -A -Deli even though other pizza shops are much closer.  Well worth a visit IMO."}
{"text":"Super fast, friendly, small town restaurant style.  Roast beef sandwich was awesome! Fresh Kaiser bun and a good three inches of beef! Hot fresh fries and pickle topped it off.   Can't wait to bring the kids!"}
{"text":"Great food.   We love the giant smoked meat sandwiches and poutine.  When I was much younger I used to drink beer here with friends, I really appreciate the cozy space and good food.   There's a reason this place has been open for almost 100 years. Seems like there's a poker night here tonight, everybody is having fun."}

{"text":"We have driven by Pic-A-Deli for quite a while, but just recently realized they have an all-day breakfast we should check out.  When we looked at the menu, the prices seemed reasonable.  According to the menu, the list of items including the sandwich I chose included home fries and either tea or coffee.  When the waitress took our drink orders, I asked to confirm that those items came with tea so I ordered tea instead of my usual water with breakfast.  She also asked if I wanted home fries or french fries with my sandwich, I didn't really want a huge meal that particular day but since it came with them I chose home fries.  I did request adding cheese to my sandwich, which when I asked turned out to be $1.50 ... a little pricey, but since their prices seemed reasonable otherwise, I agreed to it.  The food arrived fairly quickly and did taste good, the sandwich was decent and the home fries were fine, basically just a handful of potatoes on the side which is what I would expect with a meal that includes them.  When we went to pay, we were not given a bill, but the waitress added it up on the till.  It came to a much higher number than we were expecting for our meals, so we had to ask her for details.  Apparently, even though the menu states that the meals in the one section include coffee or tea and home fries, some of the items in that section do not, and apparently when she asked if I wanted home fries or french fries, that was an additional $3.50 for a handful of them, and apparently when I said that I would take tea since it was included, she chose to ignore half of what I had said.  I thought we had found a decent all-day breakfast restaurant to add to our selection but it turns out they scam and mislead their customers.  I would have been happy with the price of my sandwich with no home fries or tea (neither of which I wanted anyways) but I will not tolerate being purposely mislead and scammed.  It's unfortunate that making an extra $5 here and there by misleading customers takes precedence over gaining new customers.  I will not be back and would recommend that others avoid these scammers."}
