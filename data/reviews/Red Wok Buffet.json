{"text":"Looking for a buffet style Chinese place and this came up. It was around $8 per person for lunch. The hot tea was $1 and soda $1.50. They had a pretty broad selection. I felt some of the food was over cooked and sitting for awhile maybe cause it was a bit soggy, like the lo mein, orange chicken and fried rice. I liked the green beans, pot stickers, Korean style noodles and kung pow chicken. They have a salad bar, sushi, lots of fruit, ice cream, desserts, short ribs, shrimp, fish, soups and much more. Price was decent for the amount of food. I'm sure you are bound to find something you like with the selection. Not the best quality, but kind of expect it from an all you can eat buffet. I don't go to buffets much, but I would go back. I haven't been to any other buffets in the area so don't have much else to compare it to."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. They have quite a spread to choose from. It can be hit or miss; I've had things that were too salty and other things that needed more seasoning. I do enjoy the fact that they have a grill and I can make my own stir fry; it kept the whole bad seasoning thing as a problem. And the service wasn't bad and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Folks...lets get real. Its a chinese buffet. You get to pig out until you explode for less than 10 bucks. We all go into these places knowing its not gourmet. And we are all generally amused that they have options like pudding, enchiladas, mac n cheese and garlic bread. If your ideal evening is eating yourself into a coma and having explosive gas for about a day....Red Wok will do the trick."}
{"text":"Red Wok has a very decent buffet with many choices of the typical Chinese dishes, a surprisingly big selection of fresh and yummy sushi and a Mongolian grill section. For $10 per person it has great value and my husband and I go there for dinner every once in a while.
There are coupons for $5 off the entire bill (with purchases of $25 or more) which makes it even more affordable.
Thumbs up for this buffet!"}
{"text":"They do have what appears to be a nice selection of Sushi.  That said, the mongolian barbecue is lacking at best.  The buffet in general is ... less... than... impressive...  I found the most palatable item to be the terriyaki chicken.  Seems there are nearly as many american dishes here as 'chinese'.   Personally I don't think garlic bread, pizza, and breaded fried chicken have any place at a chinese buffet, no matter how americanized it is.  Wouldn't dare to touch any of the seafood - maybe the shrimp.  The lunch price is a couple bucks cheaper than I've found elsewhere but I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"This buffet has a wide variety!
SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
I like going here because they Have good food it is usually fresh and they have Sushi and a Mongolian grill too. They also have other foods like steak, pizza, French fries, enchiladas...
lots of desert choices including hand dipped ice cream!
It is about 10.49 per person plus drink price
GREAT FOR GROUPS TOO
*Not the best neighborhood , so lock your car :)"}
{"text":"Being Asian and the thought of an Asian buffet sounded gross. Not many have I tried came close to this restaurant. From being greeted at the door, to a huge buffet of all seemingly fresh food to the awesome service... Definitely a good place to go and eat!  

My only suggestion would be to not go on Sunday nights... The food was definitely not as fresh or hot... Some dried out or over cooked due to perhaps sitting too long.  Ew."}
{"text":"This is your ideal lunch buffet place. Their selection is quire large. There's something for everyone there, whether you're into sushi, Chinese, vegetarian, or good old comfort food. The variety is my favorite part, and it's not very expensive, either.

 I see lots of families going there, which seems like a great idea, because of all the fun dishes you get to try. The staff is friendly, and the line in front always moves quickly. It doesn't look dirty and dingy like some buffets, and they are pretty attentive with cleaning up the tables.

Only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because the food quality could be better, but that's to be expected from an all-you-can-eat buffet."}
{"text":"Wow. Stunning.  Fantastic food, with generous offerings of sushi, seafood, ice cream, you name it!  We had a blast.  Amazingly affordable as well.  

We wish we had one of these back home."}
{"text":"So being asian and having had many delicious places to eat great chinese from california, this place was really not so great.  If it was just on presentation, I would have rated a 4 star, but all the food was ok. I was telling my wife, the only thing I enjoyed was the pot stickers and my coke. We were contemplating going to China chili, in westside , which is really good by the wayc but we wanted to try a new place near home.  The wait staff was nice and friendly.

Would we go back, probably not and would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place has great food. The price is right on any budget.  The staff is nice and all the food has a different taste and is hot.  The restaurant is very clean. Great Chinese, American and Japanese food. Great value."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there...service was great and the drinks were refreshing! The food was awful. Everything tastes the same overcooked with the same sweet sauce. My pregnant friend is still in the bathroom a half an hour later!"}
{"text":"Although I do my best to stay away from Asian buffets, I tend to crack occasionally. 

This place is not a bad place to indulge. Pretty good selection of sushi and Mongolian bar b q. Don't expect Genghis Grill style just enough to put together a nice custom made dish. 

If you can stick to these two items you can get out without doing significant damage to your health. They also have the standard buffet items, salad, fruits and a really good ice cream selection. 

If you have a rare craving for a inexpensive Asian buffet this is the place. If you are a regular Asian buffet attendee you would probably be better off avoiding this place and taking a walk around your neighborhood."}
{"text":"It was pretty good but the buffet was not nearly as good as Pacific seafood Asian super buffet"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Some dishes were good. And some were dry like it was sitting there for awhile. Some food was bland, no flavoring. There were good dishes but hard to find. Desserts were store bought or out of a can. 
They make the sushi fresh but looks like its been sitting there for awhile. 
Overall not worth $25."}
{"text":"Yuck! I've been to buffets across the valley and this is the worst. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today the whole experience was awful. From all the yelling in the kitchen to the grey meat in the beef and oversized and undercooked broccoli . This is one you should really, really miss. It's no wonder they make you pay before you eat or they would go broke. If their was a minus rating here they would get it"}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.  The food was very greasy and unappetizing. 

The fried rice is an unusually bright orange. The lo mein noodles were not hot. The orange chicken tasted like it had buffalo wing sauce in it. The teriyaki chicken had an anise flavored after taste. The sushi did not taste fresh. 

There were more non-Chinese food than Chinese food options- pizza, Mexican food, etc. 

The place was not at all clean. People have commented on the ice cream. There is no way that is sanitary- everyone reaches into an ice cream freezer with their arms to serve themselves. Gross. 

This place is awful."}
{"text":"Decent enough food.  Clean and modern restaurant.  Average staff.  Great price. 

A WIN for families!

I've only eaten here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both times I had the same experience of a large selection of tasty choices for food.  They had clean and tidy entryway,  floors,  booths,  tables,  food area, and restrooms, The staff were quite good, especially considering it was a buffet.  We were more than happy to leave a well-deserved tip.   And I didn't have to feed the kids ramen for 3 days to offset some expensive meal at a restaurant that wasn't kid-friendly."}
{"text":"As with Kelly A., I'm not at all understanding the 4 and 5 star reviews. I have this pesky preference for affordable quality. Red Wok is affordable, anyway.
   My friend, who lost 90 % of his sense of taste due to a head trauma thought this place was okay. He likes buffets because he believes he's 'getting over on you' when able to gorge without restraint. Do you KNOW what a half-gallon of pudding looks like on a plate? And why is this guy even my friend?
   If you're a dedicated fan of Valley bargain buffets just bring your shovel and proceed. Even with my considerably more conservative approach, I was able to get my money's worth with careful dectective work and selection.
   My choices from around about 120 items came down to a good, simple baked white fish, unusually light and tasty seasoned fries, and a too sweet, but otherwise passable mini eclair; other desserts were fine as well.

Some notable 'misses' for me here include:

*Baked mussels w/ melted cheese. Not nearly fresh, these tasted like the very bottom of the sea. The one I tried ended up wadded in a napkin, something that almost never happens with me.

*Crawdads. (crayfish) Headsucker's Delight. You know who you are.

*Prawns. A tad too authentically presented.

*Sushi. Bland and dry, although there was a superior soy-based dipping sauce a few stations away.

*Extremely greasy soup pots.

*Lesser quality cuts of all meats which included odd tastes and textures. (not in any good way)

*Korean short ribs. (kalbi; galbi) Very, very tough and would have benefitted greatly from a few hours in a crockpot.

*Chicken skewers. Severely charred.

*Kimchi. My biggest disappointment here since I was first introduced to the real thing in Korea, it's country of origin. This version had a weird, pronounced chemical taste that implied some (dangerous?) shortcut in preparation. China is, after all, still giving us lead (the deadly metal) in kids toys, and anti-freeze in Dollar Store toothpaste . Just saying..

   The steady trickle of mid afternoon patrons showed it won't matter what I say here anyway so come on down. Ahh So."}
{"text":"Won't be going here again. The frys were ok.  Everything else was not good.
They took the plates away in a timely manner. The plates were still full of food though because it wasn't good.  
Gave them a chance but they didn't make it on my list of places to return to."}
{"text":"I have made this my new spot when in the mood for a buffet. Food is fresh. the have a Mongolian grill and a sushi bar.  The staff is very attentive and the food is rotated quite often.  Even the ice cream is rich and the place is quite clean. Nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Ate with family at Red Wok Buffet on Sunday and we all were very pleased at the huge selection of foods and how tasty everything was.  The restaurant is spotless clean and the staff are so helpful and friendly.  I enjoyed everything that I ate from the buffet."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I've ever been!!! Discriminated against a relative who is mentally disabled. Refused to seat us claiming we couldn't sit in the mostly empty room using an excuse that the waitress couldn't take care of \"all\" the customers in that area we wanted to sit. Please don't support a place that shows no tolerance for the mentally handicapped."}
{"text":"Really good food and great variety of different food and my favorite sushi.. Place is clean and staff is really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had.  Really good food.  Good bang for your buck.  Heres a tip: leave a tip!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband were driving downtown and we passed by REd WOK buffet. I decided to Google it and read some reviews since we were both hungry and we just went for it. It was fantastic! I am very skeptical about Chinese in Arizona because we are from NY and the chinese food is very tasty out there. they had everything at this buffet and I mean everything!!!! They even have an icecream freezer with REAL icecream that you can self-serve with tons of toppings which is not usually what a Chinese buffet has. The shrimp was clean, fresh and tasty. Nothing was old, everything fresh off the grill. Area is so,so but nice environment inside. If you are looking for a good bang for your buck with unlimited options try red WOK!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, the workers are not attentive as far as refills and getting your dishes. Other than that they are pretty good. I have been here several times and will come back whenever im on this side of town"}
{"text":"Well another new Chinese buffet in town and I was joined at this grand opening by Robyn N.,Norm R.,Scott W.,Rand H.,and Jeromy H. Well this new buffet was a good one with a few different tray's offered.A lot of the food fare was your typical Chinese buffet items.The staff was friendly and quick to clear your empty plates.So i will give them 4 stars because they are not as good as some of my 5 star Chinese buffets but still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went there once and will not ever go back again since they don't have a lot of food selections.  One good thing about the buffet is that you get to choose your own ice creams by scooping it yourself, but other than that, I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"This place wasn't that great it has variety but not that great.I was excited to try it but I was very disappointed  with the food and the service is horrible we had to get up and actually stop the server to get a drink refill!!! It's a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Ugh, Where do I start with this place? How do I go about rating it? Do I grade it as a Chinese Buffet, or do I compare it to all general eating establishments? All difficult questions.

Okay look, as far as Chinese Buffets go, Red Wok Buffet is above-average. That needs to be stressed. It's nearly 4 stars, but it gets 3 for a very good reason - giving it 4 stars would be an insult to all the other 4 star establishments I have reviewed. So it gets 3.

In my own experiences (3 visits), a trip to Red Wok can be extremely satisfying or incredibly disappointing or anywhere in between. It all depends what kind of mood I'm in, how strong my stomach is that particular day, what time of day I visit and what kind of day the restaurant staff is having. 

There are just too many variables to pinpoint this place. Unfortunately, it's too unpredictable for me to recommend, but I could definitely picture a hungry family visiting this place and having an outstanding and affordable meal. And picturing it is easy, because I have seen other families having exactly that type of experience every time I have visited this buffet!

Honestly, the previous reviews do a pretty good job of explaining the typical Red Wok Buffet experience. Therefore, I could easily end the review here. But that wouldn't be any fun now would it? 

You came to read a real review, so I'm going to give you one. But instead of typical explanatory paragraphs, I'm going to give you a list of quotes that will undoubtedly cross your mind if you are brave enough to visit this establishment. Some will be glowing reviews suggesting a 5-star experience. Others will make your stomach churn and question how in the hell in my right mind I gave this dingy little dive a 3-star rating. 

Please be aware, I had more \"quotes\" in mind, but I can't remember them all because I just ate at Red Wok Buffet, and I feel tired, ashamed and bloated. But this is where the action is, so let's get started:

\"Oh boy, I can't wait to visit the buffet!\"

\"This area of town is really sketchy!\"

\"There's many cars in the parking lot but still lots of parking space!\"

\"Wow the prices are very affordable and fair for an all you can eat buffet!\"

\"The lady who took my money seems very nice!\"

\"The other customers all look very suspicious!\"

\"Wow look at how many selections!\"

\"The trays appear well-stocked and taken care of!\"

\"Look at all the great choices of sushi!\"

\"Wait a second, all the sushi is imitation crab!\"

\"Everything I need to complete my dining experience is tastefully laid out!\"

\"Lots of fruit! I can't wait to load some of my plate with healthy natural goodness!\"

\"Oh wait, most of this fruit looks pretty bad. I better carefully pick out the good pieces.\"

\"Wow, this chicken looks great! And look how many different poultry options there are!\"

\"LOL It's the token American/Soup section of the buffet. I'm not wasting my stomach space on this.\"

\"Gee, I really loaded up my plate! Better wobble back to my table to eat!\"

\"Hmm this food tastes a little strange. Oh well, I'll eat it anyway.\"

\"Oh wow, this food does taste a little unusual. But if I eat it quickly, it's pretty nice, and I hardly notice any strange tastes.\"

\"This sushi is actually really good for a buffet... even if it is mostly crab.\"

\"I'm really enjoying eating all of these different foods... even if my stomach feels a little weird.\"

\"I really wish that young child at the table next to me would stop crying.\"

\"Wow! I can't believe I ate all that! Time to get some more!\"

\"Look at all the diverse food! Kim-chi, octopus, bok-choy! I haven't been to a buffet this authentic in awhile!\"

\"Is that child old enough to be at the serving station unsupervised?\"

\"Gee that other guy sure has a lot of food on his plate. No wonder his belly is large!\"

\"I can't ever get enough sushi!\"

\"I don't know what this is, but I'll try it anyway!\"

\"Another big plate. Time to chow down!\"

\"The waitstaff is on their game! My old plate is already gone and my drink is refilled!\"

\"I don't know if I can finish all this.\"

\"I really need to use the bathroom.\"

\"This seaweed salad tastes like soap.\"

\"I'm having such a good time even though my stomach is in knots.\"

\"I haven't seen a crowd this sketchy since the last time I took the bus.\"

\"I don't care if I'm sick; I'm getting my money's worth!\"

\"This chicken tastes so good, yet so unusual.\"

\"This is the best meal I've had all day. Gosh I feel nauseous.\"

\"Is it over yet?\"

\"How am I going to drive home?\"

\"Please, can that freaking child over there stop crying already!?!?\"

\"I'd probably cry too if my parents brought me to Red Wok Buffet.\"

\"Oh please, please, refill my drink again. I need to quickly wash down this poison.\"

\"I can't stop eating all of this decent food!\"

\"I feel so sick, But it's definitely not the buffet, no way! I'm coming back next week!\""}
{"text":"My first trip to red wok was average at best. There are a lot of dishes but none were very good unfortunately. It is definitely a good bang for your buck but the quality of food was certainly lacking. The sushi had definitely been sitting out or in the fridge for a while as it was very dry. The lo-mein was probably the worst I have ever had, the orange chicken was alright but just tasted like orange jelly, and they did not have the classic dishes like chicken and broccoli or general tsos. If you want a lot of below average food for a decent price then this is a good place but the quality of the food could be much better. Won't be returning as I'm sure there are better Chinese buffets in the area."}
{"text":"This is my new place to go! Plenty to choose from. Whether you are looking for sushi, a generous selection from the buffet, or Mongolian grill it has it all. 

Literally had like 4 plates, wish I had a bigger stomach!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie I think this place is also not what its yelped up to be. 

Don't get me wrong I'll probably go here again, its super close to my house and my husband found a lot to eat here. Theres a lot of things here that kids (and my husband) would like, i.e. pizza, mashed potatoes, french fries, chicken nuggets, and chicken wings.
I did really like that you can sit down quick and get right to eating lol. What I found (not terrible!) was most things were mushy and kind of bland, like the chow mien and orange chicken. I also thought their egg rolls were so gross, BUT their pot stickers are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good and they have that amazing sauce that goes with them! MMMHHMMM I will 100% go back for those alone lol. AND their sushi was actually really good! Nice small bite sizes unlike the ones you get at sit down sushi places. $25 for the two of us with drinks."}
{"text":"Great place and food although food pans often empty. Very busy weekend day that I was there but should be able to keep up."}
{"text":"I frequent this buffet. The food is always tasty and hot. Good assortment of dishes to choose from. They offer a dessert bar, veggie/fruit bar, ice cream, sushi, Mongolian grill, some American and other traditional dishes. Service is attentive and the place is always busy."}
{"text":"Went to the Red Wok (spur of the moment) on 6/7.  The people were very nice, the place seemed clean enough for a buffet.  This is where it ended.  The food was not very good (e.g orange \"Flavored\" Chicken?)  but worse than that wasn't even being served at room temperature.  In most cases it was cold.  We had several bites, worried about food poisoning, and left.  We never got food poisoning, but why risk it.  

First time I've found a buffet where the food (even the stuff on the bottom) was cold.  As an aside, too many choices reminds me of the phrase \"Jack of all, master of none\""}
{"text":"I'll give it a one of customer service food always great but waiter's suck!! We only got 1 drink each for me and my kids waitier didn't come check on us my son went without a drink for 30 mins and I went with out a drink for 10 mins so I complain and we walked out! It will be awhile if we come back again!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It's an ok place to go. The place is never nasty dirty and the food is always constantly being restocked and hot. The last time we went there our waitress was slacking on the water refills but all the other times there has been no problems on the customer service side of things. They have your basic \"Chinese\" foods along with 1 section with American and Mexican food. A sushi and Korean part also and like 6-8 different ice cream flavors and a ok dessert section. I kill for their bread pudding which they make with almond cookies & their steamed fish (salmon and another white fish I cant remember the name of) is always good."}
{"text":"Typical hi quality Chinese buffet. Recommended. Overall is good. 5 stars for there's nothing better in this area. 
Sincerely yours, www.californiaway.org"}
{"text":"Yelpers, I feel like I've been led astray! I went here expecting decent buffet food based on the reviews but everything was actually pretty gross. The miso soup was really salty, the mac & cheese had no flavor, the ice cream station was a messy disaster, and the sushi portion of the buffet had only 4 tongs for 8-10 plates of food (meaning you're using the same tongs for sushi as you are for edamame--felt unsanitary for me). Most of the food was overcooked and under-flavored. 

 In all honesty, I thought I would probably get food poisoning from at least one thing here and was surprised that I didn't. I am by no means a princess and can enjoy a good dive with questionable sanitation standards...this means that if my cleanliness/food safety radar is going off, there is a problem. 

2 stars because the waitress was sweet and attentive. Also, since the food was so bad, I wasn't tempted to overeat. Take your money elsewhere if you enjoy quality food. If you want to stuff your face and don't care about taste, this works."}
{"text":"Been to this buffet a couple of times.
The buffet the first time was fresh, hot and the value good.
The second time it took us 15 minutes to get our drinks, some of the sushi was drying out, all of the fried food was greasy, the meat gamey and overall the food was not at all appetizing.  The first experience was a solid B, the second was a  straight up failure.

There was a \"Now Hiring\" sign in front we noticed on our way out (wish we'd been paying more attention while entering).  One has to wonder what position is being filled.

We won't be back and will not recommend this buffet to anyone."}
{"text":"It'll do when you have to have chinese buffet. It's very noisy, the clientele will knock you around passing too closely to your table and wandering randomly around the steam tables without watching where they are going. Some of the items have flavor some are meh. I like that they have bok choy by itself, and all the items stay stocked. Some non chinese items are actually very good like mac & cheese. The sushi bar looks nice but i don't like sushi. The staff are really nice and keep your glass filled, very attentive. seems to be very clean. I recommend the soups. stay away from the pizza. The chicken dishes aren't very distiguishable if you close your eyes. They have ice cream."}
{"text":"First time visit and I was not disappointed. The food was hot and fresh. The restaurant was a good size and clean. The variety of food was heavenly.

The menu included sushi rolls, Mongolian grill, soups and all the other chines plates you can think of.  You can please all your family here. There is even cheese crisp, chicken wings and pizza for the kids. Unfortunately I never made it to the desert area but I heard no complaints from the people in my group who did.

I am not fan of buffets but I will come back because my mom is."}
{"text":"The place seems very clean, from the looks of the place, it seems like they try to make sure of the cleanliness. The place is big, too. Lots of room and plentiful seating. Not to mention the massive salad bar. 

The snack section is, the neighborhood isn't the best, and the prices are a bit high, but overall, the place is really good.

UPDATE 

Took the rating down to 3 stars because I just saw an attendant refill the orange chicken, one of the morsels fell onto the tray slider and he used the tongs to scrape it into the pan. Scary."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet several times, from when it newly opened to the present time ... more frequently now that I've moved much closer. From the beginning, I've found to food quality to be good and sometimes even excellent, with a good array of seafood and a lot of standard Chinese buffet dishes - all well-seasoned and efficiently replenished. The metro Phoenix area has no shortage of Chinese-themed buffet restaurants, but this is one of my top picks for this genre of eatery."}
{"text":"My wife says they have VERY GOOD Chinese food. A little noisy with kids, but otherwise a nice environment."}
{"text":"I'm still smh as I write this one.

I think that everyone that knows me, knows that my favorite cuisine is Chinese food. I received a recommendation about this place from a Phoenician. Supposedly it is the best Chinese buffet in these parts. I'm not a fan of the buffets, but I love Chinese food. I walked in and there was an un-attentive young man behind the counter glancing through houses online. I said, \"Excuse me, do I seat myself\". He said no, \"Pay first\". Buffet and drink = $12. Cool. As he seats me, I notice that the place is huge! and they have a great selection of food items. You can see the steam curling from the food bins (Yum!! when can I dig in!) I was shown to my table and I immediately headed to the buffet. I got a little bit of this and a whole lot of that, walk back to the table, and begin to eat. Everything was so good. The waiter came up to my table as I look up with a noodle of lo-mein dangling to get into my mouth. He placed the drink down and said, \"You pretty!\" (wa-what?!) \"Thank you\", I stated as I swallowed. \"You here by self.\"  I nodded. Looking up, I'm thinking...where is this going. The waiter parted by saying if there was anything that I needed, just let him know. He appeared minutes later and inquired about what I had done that day. (Really?!) I'm trying to eat! Being polite, I said that I had shopped all day. He wanted to know where. I told him. He walked away to assist others, then returned. He inquired about why I had two phones on the table and stated that it must be hard to connect with me. Then he asked if I had a boyfriend. Son, I have shoes older than you, I thought to myself. \"Yes.\" I dishonestly answered. I  had to do something to keep him from getting shot down when he asked for my telephone number. What a COMPLETE turn off! I mean really??? Totally out of line. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, I left a tip (I know, I shouldn't have) and I ducked out while he returned dishes to the kitchen. 

The food was excellent. I didn't get the true feel of the buffet as I only got one plate and a bowl of soup. They did have sushi, mongolian bar, salad, and dessert; all of which I did not experience."}
{"text":"Sunday night, and I can't decide between Mongolian BBQ and sushi.  My stomach and taste buds were at an impasse.  Happily, I'd read the early reviews for Red Wok, and realized I could have both for one low price!  (Dinner $9.99, soft drink $1.50)

Granted - I had VERY few of the buffet offerings, so this review is quite limited.  

Since the place has only been open a month, it's still really clean and fresh.  Some attention was paid to decor (wall treatments and lighting), and is well laid out.  Employees were constantly cleaning and replacing food trays, so it's nice to know that freshness is considered here.  (Not the case in several of the places I've been.)

The sushi selection was actually better than I'd anticipated.  Shrimp, salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri, tuna and yellowtail sashimi, and various rolls (most of which having the typical California or spicy tuna base.)  It was all cold and fresh and clearly recently prepared.  

The Mongolian BBQ area was sufficient, if not impressive.  The veggies were all very fresh, the meats were cold and fresh, but not frozen as I've grown used to seeing.  Relatively slim sauce selection - but I was quite happy with my concoction.

From the regular buffet line, I did have a couple coconut prawns (decent flavor, good texture), a couple pieces of spicy chicken (meh)and some green veggie that wasn't broccoli rabe and wasn't bok choi, but something in that general family and quite well prepared (YUM).  I also tried a steamed BBQ pork bun.  That was the only disappointment - the texture was right, but it was tasteless.

I've never been thrilled with Chinese buffet desserts, though the ice cream case with assorted toppings is a step in the right direction.  I stuck with fresh watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew for my sweet needs.  

I'm sure I'll be back - and plan to try more of the offerings - but can see myself getting stuck in the sushi and Mongolian BBQ habit."}
{"text":"This place is as great as any smaller or larger Asian or American cuisine awesome service great atmosphere and incredible food all u can eat!"}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant the food was good. Accommodated a family of 10. Food was hot seemed fresh. 

However, 

My husband and I came here for lunch. The food was cold I had beef and broccoli, frys, wontons, fried rice, chow mein, and a chicken dish. Steam was coming from the table however everything I put in my plate was cold. I spoke with the manager a gentleman. He proceeded to tell me I was lying he then laughed and told me there is steam it can't be cold. He never got a thermometer and checked the temperature of the food. I will not be returning to this restaurant based on this experience. We have been here before and didn't have this type of experience. $21.80 for a meal I could not eat."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was fresh and tasty. The selection was plentiful and diverse. Bonus, it was cheap to. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place had the best Sushi bar I have ever seen at a buffet the help was friendly and the food was piping hot. Nice atmosphere too! This was opening day and they had a couple bugs to work out so I'd like to come back soon and see how there doing!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food, with plenty of options. I like to get takeout by the pound - $3.50/lb for most dishes and $4.50/lb if seafood or desserts are included."}
{"text":"Was there Saturday early evening. The selection was mediocre and pretty much everything I tried was flavorless.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food wasn't horrible but not anything to write home about. Bathrooms were absolutely filthy. Dining room tables were sticky. There are too many other reliably good dining options in this area to waste your time here."}
{"text":"NEVER GO HERE!!!!!! My family didn't even finish eating 1 plate of food and my son needed to use the bathroom. He is 4 so I took him to the women's restroom with me. I walked in to all 3 stalls backed up and overflowing with feces and pee. Turned to walk out and noticed puke in the sink. I immediately went and told the workers and they acted like it was a normal thing and didn't even seem to care. We had to pay up front and did not bother asking for our money back we just walked out. I'm disgusted for sure."}
{"text":"quality of food poor!
Atmosphere of restaurant poor!
do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Decent amount of food to choose from including Mexican, American, sushi, and seafood. Lots of staff which were always busy cleaning. Can't lie about the taste of the Chinese food which was definitely off. My friend described the food as 'gross'.  Sunday around dinner time so there was a lot people but stuff was still stale and had an old feel to it. $10.99. $1.99 drinks. Unlimited refills. Would never return."}
{"text":"I like to visit a Chinese Buffet from time to time and this is one of the better ones I've been to. They have decent sushi, smelled and tasted good and better than what you'd get at a grocery store. All the food was the right temperature and they have a Mongolian grill included.  Terriyaki, honey chicken are damn good.  You can get in and out for lunch at around $8."}
{"text":"Good food, fresh items on the Buffet. Small Sushi selection,  Hibachi, soups, salads, and deserts. Good for at a great price!"}
{"text":"Had to grab dinner in central Phoenix on my way to an event and decided to try Red Wok as I drove by.  Huge place, dinner is $10, place looked pretty clean. So far, so good.
So I grabbed a plate and headed toward the buffet.  The buffet is huge with easily 100 selections.  Problem is 98 of them looked so bad I couldn't bring myself to even try them.
I grabbed what I thought was surely one of those beef skewers you see at most chinese buffets; but the I looked to see the sign above it said \"Teriyaki Chicken\".  Needless to say I put it back immediately. 
Now I am NOT a picky eater by any means but the only thing I could even bring myself to try were the Korean BBQ ribs which were way overcooked and chewy, a california roll (it may be a good thing that all the sushi is made from \"krab mix\" with no real fish in sight), some white rice, and the almond green beans which were actually fresh, not frozen, and really good.
They also have Thrifty ice cream which is always a winner, but just as with the dinner selections, all the other desserts looked left over from weeks ago.
So if you enjoy a cheap buffet dinner, with lots of variety, in a pleasant and clean atmosphere then Red Wok might be for you.  If your criteria in food includes \"edible\", stay away."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food buffets. I have been Pokemon-ing them around Phoenix for years. Needless to say there are some bad ones. This is a good one. They had soooo many types of chicken.

Okay, so I was pregnant and craving chicken. That doesn't make my review any less valid. I had three plates. I would have kept going but my husband looked bored.

Nothing seemed stale and there were many options. It seemed clean for a Chinese Buffet."}
{"text":"Not much of a fan of buffets except if it's at a casino.  

Red Wok Buffet works only if you're glutton.  Yes, just keep stuffing your face.  I didn't think the food was good obviously.  The only thing I thought was decent was the Teriyaki chicken; nicely glazed with the sauce while fried with crispy edges.  Just the way I like it!  Everything else was bland.  This is what I consider \"stay alive\" food.  If I needed to survive I'll come eat this stuff, but overall not my favorite buffet place.  

The place itself is pretty similar to most Asian buffet restaurants.  Very basic Asian decors to make sure you know you're in an Asian restaurant buffet.  One highlight I guess would be the service was decent. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'd really give this place 4.5 stars but it's not really a 5 and a little better than a 4.  Today was their grand opening - and by the time it was getting crowded.

The food was very good, your usual chinese buffet foods in addition to sushi/sashimi and a mongolian bbq station.  The clams and the fried crab was a nice addition and they also had a station of American foods.  There was an excellent salad bar with more choices than the average Chinese buffet.  The food was served HOT, was well prepared and the service was excellent.  Since was there first day they didn't have all the food selections when we arrived at 11.  But I noticed they kept adding more things while we were there.  Would have liked to try more of their dim sum items, all I had was the tea leave wrapped sticky rice and it was not my favorite; too sweet and gummy rather than a savory item I am more used to.

9.99 for weekend lunch, 7.39 during the week."}
{"text":"I had the good fortune to attend opening day with Rand H, Norm R, Mike 
C, Robyn N and Jeromy H.  AKA the buffet testers :-)  

All of the Asian dishes I tasted were good as were the deserts.  I felt they fell short on the mac and cheese and the clam chowder.  Although I didn't have much I felt the selection of salad fixings were above normal.  I was quite impressed with the selection of sushi.  Our party has different ideas of what foods they judge a buffet by and there were very few items that fell short of properly prepared.

They had some opening day hiccups like being able to get the cash registers to work, getting all the menu items labeled and I think they should have a pile of napkins with the flatware so you can grab some.  I think it was one of the owners that saw me taking pictures and pointed out some shots I should take.  Our table was also visited by the owner of the building who is taking a highly visible interest in how things are being accepted by the customers.

If you are in to Chinese buffets this is one you should put on your list to try."}
{"text":"a clean buffet with lots of food options. this is definitely one of the better buffets I've been to. they have a good variety of foods and all were fresh. the staff was very friendly. the place is always busy, so you know it's good. would recommend this place over many other phoenix buffets."}
{"text":"I do not like greasy oriental buffets - Red Wok is a delightfully non-greasy buffet.  I have visited them between 11 and 3pm, 4 times in the last 8 weeks.  It is my new favourite oriental buffet!

Service is courteous and prompt.  Salad, sushi and hot entrees selections are varied and generally of better quality than other Oriental buffets I have been to.  Their creamy fruit salad, sesame green beans and radish salad are all exceptional.  It's sushi table is always fresh and nicely put together for the price point.   My 10 year old loves their sesame honey chicken I prefer their baked salmon and shrimp w / vegetables.  They've had passable Miso, hot & sour and egg drop soup.   

The standard children's menu offerings; pizza, French fries, mac-n-cheese & mild buffalo wings are mediocre, but then they are designed to appeal to blandness loving children's palates."}
{"text":"Their beef and broccoli is superb,along with the lo mein & hibachi seseme chicken. The restaurant is clean and buffet has a variety to choose from."}
{"text":"I used to like this place and would come almost weekly. They've now raised their lunch prices to almost $14 for lunch and a drink which is outrageous money for lunch at a divey little Chinese buffet. Like most Chinese buffets, I can only imagine dinner is even more expensive.

Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This was our second attempt, we went back after another experience about a year ago because my husband wanted to give it another try. I would have to say the quality of the food has gone downhill a bit, though they still have a wondrous variety of Asian and American items to choose from, including various salads, cold seafood, not to mention desserts. If you want variety this is your place. My favorite item, strangely, was the egg drop soup. It was perfect. But that didn't make up for the lack of freshness and a good many items on the hot buffet tables (and having a couple of bowls of soup for over $12 doesn't sit right with me). On the other hand, they've been there a while, so I'm sure they have a following that loves their food. The service (filling drinks and taking away plates), was better than average. My review is mostly based on the food, though. Worth trying if you just want to eat a mountain of Asian/American food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have always had great service and never got sick from eating here. It's really not a bad place and always lots of good food to choose from."}
{"text":"The area this restaurant is located in may look ghetto, but the food here is wonderful! That's saying a lot considering that I am real picky when it comes to Chinese food. This place does a great job providing an ample variety of food to choose from.  The buffet contains a diverse selection of food containing steak, chicken, and seafood.  My favorite is the hot and spicy chicken although the orange chicken comes close.  Their crab puffs are really good too.  The only thing I was slightly disappointed in were the egg rolls. It's hard to explain, but they're not made like they make them back East (where I'm originally from). The egg rolls here (and other places out West) are smooth and have some sort of \"paste\" inside them while the egg rolls back home have a textured crust and more meat inside them. Do keep in mind that the egg rolls at this place weren't bad, they just didn't have the same level of awesomeness.  Regardless, the rest of the food at this place was amazing.  I do hope to return here soon."}
{"text":"Despite some of the reviews, I gave this place a chance. It was delicious! The food was steaming off and on my plate. Very fresh and even if it was half empty, they still filled it up. The service was very friendly and it was clean."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good! It reminds me of Chinese food back East. They even had boneless spare ribs, which is rare here. I thought the  crab legs and shrimp were on point too! My dining partner didn't like it at all. She is a vegetarian though so I guess she didn't have the options she wanted. I'm still very much on the meat train though, and I was content!"}
{"text":"If you are a lover of Chinese food,  this not be the place to go.  This is more of a seafood cuisine,  and I was not too pleased with the salad bar. The macaroni salad looks as if it's been sitting for days.  There is no beef and broccoli,  no orange chicken, no kung pao.... Again I can't say that this is Chinese food. Lots of sushi, crab, shrimp, not my thing.  Two stars for the place though."}
{"text":"I have been to this location numerous times and i have not had a bad experience. The food is very good and there is a good selection of vegetables making it easy to select healthy option. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I haven't been in Phoenix that long and was trying to find a decent Chinese buffet when a co-worker recommend red wok. Seeing as it was really close to where I lived I decide to give it a try. And I must say, it was pretty good.
The food was what you would expect from a cheap buffet. Maybe a little bit above average. Although the American dishes like Mac n cheese, mash potatoes etc was sun par everything else was decent.
The staff was very attentive, making sure my plates were cleared, my drinks were replenished and they'd would check up on you to make sure you were comfortable. I have to say some \"high end\"restaurants do not even bother to do the little things. 
Overall I would comeback and if the staff stays the course, this could be a regular establishment in which I would frequent."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype in prior reviews is about.  This is one of the dirtiest restaurants I've been in.  The food is routine at best.  The frying oil was old and made the Mongolian BBQ taste rancid.  This place has been reincarnated several times, and each time it gets dirtier and worse.  This is far from the best and closer to one of the worst."}
{"text":"My experience in Red wok is okay. When i say okay i mean is not the restaurant's fault they hired such a clumsy busser. But anyways the food is great everything looks clean bathrooms, outside  etc! talking about the busser she was kind of rude but at the end she deserve nothing but a 0$ tip."}
{"text":"The worst customer service, attitude, Iv ever wittnessed, demand to  pay rite in front door. Ask for tip b4 you ever get something to drink.Rush you to finish and leave. Top it all off \"NO MILK\" ONE STAR IS TO MANY. DON'T EVEN ASK WEN A FRESH PAN OF FOOD MITE BE COMEING OUT. YOU'LL BE SORRY. Oh the quality of food.. I would have rather eaten a circle k  hotdog.Deploreable"}
{"text":"I do not normally like to eat in buffets because I do not like to overeat, but my mom wanted to try this place.

They just opened, so we decided to try this place for lunch.

I thought it was decent, and some of the dishes were actually pretty tasty.

I noticed the majority of buffet eaters were gravitating towards the fried and hot food stations. They had a variety of items such as baked salmon, fried shrimp, crab casserole, fried chicken, baked mussels, pork humba and more. My brother liked them, and he said they were remarkably flavorful.

I went to the fruit and salad station and tried the sushi bar which had a wide selection.

I love the fact that they have edename and kim chee on their appetizer buffet. Good stuff!

They also have a stir fry station where food is made to order. You put all your vegetable ingredients, and sauces on a plate, and they will make a stir fry dish for you.

The dessert cakes also look appetizing, but I skipped them and tried the ice cream instead.

They have various flavors, and you can even put toppings on them.

I tried the peppermint ice cream which was quite refreshing.

The place was also very clean, and they also offer senior discounts.

To sum up my review, I give them 4 stars for having a large selection and great service. Lots of choices both for vegetarians and meat eaters.

I think they will do well. They picked an excellent location with ample parking and great buffet price too.

For $7.50 plus tip, there's no room for grumbling."}
{"text":"We called to ask how much the buffet was. They said $7.39 so we stopped in. They charged my credit card $17.31 for 2. She said they just raised their prices. I held up the menu sitting right in front of her and it said 7.39. She refused to honor that, even refusing to ask her boss to do an override. We had some exchanges about the definition of decency and honesty and then left. They still have not reversed the charges. We felt very uncomfortable and unwelcome at Red Wok."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food was decent with quite a variety of different selections."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese Buffet I have found, here in Phoenix. They have a nice range of selections and most everything is tasty. Not only is the food  good, but it is very inexpensive!  21$ for two senior dinners only water to drink.  I'm sure that soda will add a few dollars more. One truly gets a bang for their buck here! Lol pun intended."}
{"text":"We've been a few times and have had both good and bad experiences. I guess it just depends on who's cooking and whether they're having a good day or not. There are always a few things that look really questionable like the whole fish dishes and the crab. Then there are a few things that we won't get again like the bokchoy dish, the cream cheese ragoons and the egg rolls. But a few of the tasty items are the coconut shrimp, the really thin chow mein (not the thick noodle one) the orange chicken, Chinese bbq pork, the mushrooms and the sugared donuts. The desserts are \"eh...\" but if you need to end with a sweet the little cakes are decent, along with the donuts. So overall, lower your standards, like really low, and you'll be ok. It's hard to find good Chinese in AZ, especially Chinese buffets but this one is decent enough. I'm sure we'll go when we need a Chinese buffet fix."}
{"text":"The front desk lady is not full of energy. She has no impression what so ever. Although they do have  variety of food , some of the food looks as if it's been trying to be used yesterday as well. Other than that the waitresses were great!"}
{"text":"Buffets can be scary; I'm not talking about the eating-too-much type of scary, but rather that six-or-twelve-hours-after-the-fact scary. Sushi? Yea, you know the drill. At the Red Wok, there is no need to worry. Everything seemed fresh and tasty, even the coconut cookies. 

The sushi was good, but the Korean noodles were really good. There are a lot of choices to please everyone (it is a big buffet). Only disappointment was the Chinese doughnut. Skip that and have another plateful of something else. Or just have a few more coconut cookies."}
{"text":"This Chinese/Japanese buffet was AMAZING!  They had everything I could want and more. The sushi rolls were excellent. So were the bbq pork ribs and fresh green beans. I am VERY picky and this is the best Chinese buffet I have had. They even had steamed bbq pork buns! The desserts were great to. I had the chocolate espresso layer cake and hand-scooped green tea ice cream. There are 8 flavors to choose from. I will be back."}
{"text":"Customer service was okay, if you look at it its in a part of the town that's kind of low end. Other than that the food was okay, I feel like there should be more attendants at the food area so the kids or whoever doesn't touch the food.  Price was reasonable but I felt like, you pay for what you get so, a basic all you can eat selection nothing too over the top stuff? Soda was 2 dollars and you only get one refill? But anyways sushi was dull, the soft serve was out of order. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the water to be honest! And only giving two stars cause the price if even that should have been 5 dollars per person.  Anyways I wouldn't particularly recommended it with your friends it's more of a, your hungry and there's no other good places around to eat. Well enjoy"}
{"text":"I'd give it 4 stars for the sushi but a 3 for the rest of the food. The buffet choices are just OK. Nothing was particularly great. I have always loved coconut shrimp everywhere Ive eaten it but this place...yuk.  The worst Ive tasted.
The ice cream bar is pretty cool. Desserts are also store bought cake, not impressive.
If you are hungry, this is the place to go but if you are just looking for some really good food, Id try a different buffet. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I really like thid place. Unlike many Chinese restaurants I have been to. They are very clean. Food was good with many options.  Caryout was a little pricey,  but worth it"}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi and nigiri; yellowtail sashimi and nigiri; kalbi; bulgogi; kimchi.  Those items alone are worth the $9.99 dinner.  Go there now!  Eat $100 worth of sushi and use their Wi-Fi..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese buffet places and it's pretty close to home so we come here fairly often.  

I came here on Friday night with my husband and my toddler daughter.  We were charged about $22.50 for two adult dinners (baby is free) and a hot tea for my husband (just water for me and the baby.)  The host went out of his way to find a plastic spoon and fork for our little daughter...I thought that was nice of him.

Their service is very friendly, and in fact I have always been treated extremely well by the staff every time we've ever come.  Their service is so friendly and the food is so tasty that I actually rented out their private back room for my daughter's 16th birthday party last year.   

The food was very good on this visit, and I really enjoyed the fried catfish, green beans, fried chicken, seafood delight, baked mussels and the Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns).  They also have a nice sushi offering and a nice salad bar and dessert selection although I didn't have anything from those cases on this visit.
Also, I've never tried it so I don't know how it is; but they also offer Mongolian BBQ too.  

The only thing I would mention that was negative about this visit was that our table, while it appeared to be clean, was actually sticky.  I'm assuming it was wiped off with an already sticky rag.    

Overall this is a good buffet.  I would suggest them, as long as they make sure the tabletops aren't sticky."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food however they clean the tables with a Pine-Sol cleaner and the scent is awful not to mention the particles you inhale can be very nauseating.  Also they sweep around your table while you are eating which is not a good practice. Everyone is friendly and I have been going for awhile but I truly hope they change cleaning solution to a unscented cleaner and maybe get pushbrooms to avoid stirring up dust particles around peoples table while they are eating."}
{"text":"Bad service alright food as a server myself i was shocked at the non service. Never once gpt a refil on my drink Sue! And by the way Sue ypu sucked , you looked at my empty drink 3 times. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother's and sisters every thing was better than I expected, Big section and well maintained and fresh sushi! definitely would stop by again"}
{"text":"If there was a zero star I would give it to this place because it doesn't deserve one. I've been coming here since it opened because they started out with fresh food but throughout the years the have started downgrading on the food. I went about 2 weeks ago && there was a COCKROACH BY THE FOOD AND TO MAKE IT WORSE, ONE OF THEIR LONG TIME COOKS WHO HAS GLASSES KNEW IT WAS ROAMING AROUND THE FOOD AND INSTEAD OF TAKING ACTION DECIDED TO STARE && LAUGH. While he saw that I had noticed the cockroah.  I can't believe they have an A.  The lady that replaces the food doesn't even care about hygiene, the food that has fell from the trays that are all dirty and been sitting there, she will put back into the fresh food. SO GROSS 
if this doesn't help. Then I'm sorry for if you get sick but you know why now."}
{"text":"The food quality and selection here is not bad for a buffet, especially considering the price. The major problem is cleanliness and sanitation. My most recent visit was on a busy Sunday afternoon. The dining room tables and floors were simply filthy, and one of the sinks in the men's room was filled with vomit (no kidding).  While the staff was good at restocking the buffet with fresh, hot stuff, they seemed totally unconcerned about the mess in the dining area and bathroom.  The food quality and selection is 3star for a buffet, especially considering the sushi selection, but because of the nastiness of the place I cant see giving more than a 2star rating overall."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Everything was fresh and delicious until I took a bite into their habachi chicken. Eww I pulled like a 5 inch long hair out of my mouth. Most disgusting thing ever!!"}
{"text":"I could regale you with a list of every dish available but it is a buffet so you know what to expect before you walk in. 
It specializes in Asian cuisine so the majority of dishes have a distinctly oriental flavor.
They do have some non-Asian dishes including mashed potatoes, pizza, French fries and barbecued chicken. They also have some steak pieces and spicy ribs as well.
If you are hungry for sushi you will be able to fill yourself up with standard sushi fare. They also have seaweed salad and edamame.
The meal is less than $10 for dinner unless you want to add a soft drink which is $2 more.
The most common entree is chicken which is prepared in at least twelve different ways.
They have some interesting desserts as well as ice cream so you will not leave here hungry.
There is seating for lots of people as well as an additional room that will seat a whole bunch more.
This is not a place to take your sweetheart on a first date. Also not a place to impress the boss. Great for large groups if you are paying for everyone. Great for hungry people and people who enjoy stuffing themselves to the gills and then feeling bad because they couldn't control their greed.
Red Wok will not appeal to everyone and once in a while it may not agree with you, but it is great value for money."}
{"text":"Omggggggg I took my nephews inside and we're standing there waiting and there's A HUGE caca roach on the floor!!!!!! So disgusting do not eat here I want to throw up!!! They get negatives stars!!!! I could not believe my eyes!! I've never seen anything so disgusting in my life!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fam recommended by my mom's friend who lives here and met up with us. Her and her husband said this was one of the better buffets they have been to in the area and said we would like it too. We got there and it wasn't crazy busy, and the prices weren't too high. We got a table quickly and headed to the food! It was actually good! The sushi was fresh and they had steak! There was a spicy chicken dish that was so delish! The waitress takes the drink orders and brings them to the table and then checks on you periodically to see what else your party needs. It was about $97 for 9 people to eat including tip so it wasn't bad at all! Will definitely come back when with a huge group of people, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food for a buffet. They have a wide variety to include sushi, salad bar and many types of soups. If you're in the area and want a fast meal without eating fast food, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"So usually I go to a Chinese buffet and have mostly average items with a few wows and a few blahs. Here is a different story. You enter and a very energetic and polite hostess greets you and asks you what you would like to drink. You then pay ($10 and change for dinner) and then are seated. The first plate I had had a mix of American, Mexican, and Chinese foods. There was some quesadila thing that had some beans and cheese and a little bit of meat inside. It was just meh whatever, but the buffalo wing that I tried was really good... it wasn't really over the top spicy, but had some spice and was kinda sweet... so I guess it would be a mild wing. Also a unique thing here is they have Louisiana style catfish. I've never been to Louisiana, but the catfish was AMAZING! Another one of their several awesome dishes were the coconut shrimp... it was nice and flavorful and not dry. The teriyaki chicken actually had teriyaki flavor unlike most the buffets that just have a chicken slice in some weird soupy sauce. They gyoza and cream cheese puffs were both done right.... the gyoza with a ever so slight crisp and the cream cheese puff with a light flaky coating not the break your tooth style most buffets feature. They have a Mongolian grill which I did not try this visit, along with soups, a salad and fruit bar, and a small dessert bar I did not try either. I did try their sushi and must say it was very well done for a buffet.  Only two of the rolls had cream cheese, and they had shrimp nigiri and I believe red snapper sashimi. I think this place has many visits from me in its future."}
{"text":"Super good!! Super fresh and great atmosphere!!! Food was rotating and there were never an empty pan of anything."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not horrible. There seems to be a lot more variety upon first glance than when you are walking around with a nearly empty plate, wondering what to put on it next. 
As with many buffets nowadays, there is WAY TOO MUCH seafood. Even if you enjoy it, the smell overwhelms other foods and the variety of chicken, pork, and beef dishes suffers so they can have all those trays full of pasty fish, greasy skrimps, and crawdads, otherwise known as creekroaches. 
Much of the serving trays are full of fruits and salad items, too. What I did find to eat, basically orange chicken(mostly breading), and bbq ribs(mostly bone), was pretty tasty, although there ate many places in the valley to get this generic buffet fare, and either get your drink included for an $8 lunch, or pay a couple dollars less for it. 
If you're in the area for work or something, and don't have time to get over the few short miles to COFCO center for real Chinese , then this'll do."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Was hungry and found this place because it had high stars. This was the worst $30 spent. The only thing that was halfway decent was the cheese ragoons. The fried donuts were bland and they they were covered in sugar. Rice and noodles were bland and dried. The food was not worth 4 stars. I've had better meals in Thailand jail."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome. Having just moved to Phoenix from the Bay Area I was skeptical on which Chinese buffet offered truly  delicious well prepared healthy food. A colleague Tecommended this place, from the time your greeted by the pleasant greeters throughout the entire dining experience our server was overly polite and gracious to insure a positive  dining experience.  The food choices are endless from traditional Chinese delicacies to sushi and all American food. I would highly recommend you try this wonderful place the next time your craving Chinese food or sushi or all American food selections."}
{"text":"I visited Red Wok with coworkers on a Sunday. Service was attentive and polite. The selection of food was good. I tried some salmon, baked mussels, sautéed green beans and Bok Choy. The food is decent just your average greasy Chinese food. Honestly this place would be just fine if we hadn't seen a indoor cockroach crawl up the wall at our booth. If you eat here stay away from the walls, sit at a table."}
{"text":"I really don't like going here.  It seems that I spend most of my time tasting things and not really loving anything.  On the other hand, there is great variety, the food is fresh, and the place is clean, and none of the food is bad.  When my friends want to go there, I don't argue, I just wouldn't choose it myself."}
{"text":"The food was pretty disappointing. My bf & I were craving some buffet food & decided to come here which wasn't the best idea. He was really looking forward to some crab legs & more but the crab legs were fried. I'm from MD so I felt the fried crab legs was disrespectful. I liked the green beans which were oily so I didn't need to reapply lipgloss. No sarcasm in that last statement. Other than that, the food lacked good taste. I think my favorite part of the meal was my soda."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, majority of the food items tasted bland, yet tolerable.  Maybe they ran out of MSG? 

Its not to say that bland is necessarily a bad thing but Chinese cuisine is generally known for packing a lot of flavors and spices!  I truly felt that most things I came across just did not taste quite right and could have used a dash of more salt or spice.  Some came out steaming hot and fresh while some just looked kind of dead and unappealing.  For instance, the \"glazed\" bbq pork ribs looked cold and lonely.  

One thing that stood out to me was the absence of honey walnut shrimp! Most Asian buffets offer that! Another disappointment was the watered down egg drop soup! There was almost zero viscosity (very low thickness).  It was like sipping tea.

The items from the sushi bar was easily the most mediocre thing you could get.  You can just visually taste it.  I dared not touch the nigiris.  The salmon, tuna, and yellow tail simply looked dried.  The freshness dissipated! I did eat some of the sushi that appeared safe and edible such as the California and spicy tuna rolls.  The only fresh side I got from the bar was the seaweed salad, which I thought was fine.

The fruit and dessert bar had a nice variety of fruits, which tasted semi-fresh.

Surprisingly, I did enjoy their Nuggets! Its very comparable to McNuggets!

The decor was overall clean with a contemporary finish.  Staff in the front and waiters were pleasant and friendly.

For a lunch buffet that offered as many items as they did, pricing ($8 and water) was very appropriate and justifiable."}
{"text":"This buffet is one worst I've been to in Phoenix. Gave me, My daughter, and my husband horrible stomach pains. And diarrhea. The service is horrible and the prices are ridiculous. Will never go here or recommend it."}
