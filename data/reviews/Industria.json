{"text":"C'est cher pour la qualité. C'est moyen comme service et nourriture. Il a fallu que je demande à la serveuse de nous apporter les condiments pour la pizza quand j'étais rendu à mon  1/3 du plat. Ça vaut pas le détour à moins que vous habitez dans le coin."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night with friends from work. We were all first timers at Industria so no one knew what to really expect from this place. First when you enter the restaurant, you will like the decor and the whole ambiance it has. Music is isn't too loud so it's perfect for conversations.   I ordered my first drink: Industria Ceaser. It was very well done, i loved it.   For my appetizer i had the salmon tartar, one word: OMG! It's delicious, it's so good i couldn't get enough of it. I decided to get two other appetizers instead of the pizza. I ordered a beef tartar and an arugula salad with parmesan, pear and balsamic sauce. Both were so yum!! I just loved it.  My friends had pizzas and they all looked so delicious! Everybody was impressed with the food and service of this place.  For dessert we all got a pizza with nutella and something else on top of it, not sure what's it called but i totally loved it!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I saw that Industria was opening in Carrefour Laval and got curious and went to try it at Les Galleries D'Anjou. It was a Friday night and it was quite busy, we were seated fairly quickly. The menu have many options, from pizza to pasta, sandwiches, chicken, beef basically it has something for every taste. We started with some lambs chops for appetizers. I must say it was one of the best I have had. Usually the lambs are not very good in smell, but this was juicy, a nice smell of char and cooked perfectly, very elegant and small, great appetizer to share.  Then we ordered pizza, I had the Bufalina, which is tomato sauce, cherry tomatoes, basil, and fresh bufalina mozzarella. My friend had the calabrese , with suppressata sausage, tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella.   I absolutely loved my bufalina pizza, loved the pizza dough, loved the crumbled mozzarella on top. I truly enjoyed it, my friend on the other hand, hated his pizza, first of all it had a foul smell to it which it was probably the sausage, honestly its an acquired taste. But he gave me a bite, and I couldn't even in my mouth as I could not stand the smell.  We finished with dessert, I had a mochaccino   With canoli and it was very very good.  The ambiance is nice, very loud though and after 8 they brought a DJ which made it even louder, it reminded me of the days I use to go to Universe.  All in all a good experience, will go back once it opens in Carrefour"}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's day @ lunch time, a friend and I, to catch up.   Good points :  - I love their decor - You can book on opentable - Service was friendly - They automatically bring you salt/pepper/chili peppers / spicy oil / parmesan! Loved the fact I did not have to ask for it  Less good points :  - Small portions indeed though was perfect for us - It was written fresh bocconcini on menu, but we needed to specify because my friend is pregnant and it's not fresh bocconcini, its the pasteurized one you'd buy at groceries   We shared a gnocci poutine as an apetizer, it's a small portion for a 10$ apetizer (considering you could pay that for an entire real poutine) but it was interesting. I'd say it was very tasty. Not the usual sauce, they put some cream in it, but we finished it no problem since it was small.   Then we shared a pizza, one of the vegeterian option, which was good. We were 2 girls, so that was plenty enough for us, though I would understand some people mentioned it was a small pizza for 17-18$.   The waiter was very nice, he just forgot to give us the free ferrero rocher at the end !!"}
