{"text":"Finally a restaurant that offers authentic Taiwanese eateries. They are different and omg they are good. Indulge yourself with the following as a start:  - Pork Belly Bun (aka Bao). Make sure you also order some for takeout. - Porkchop Mealbox ???. Comes with rice, egg, etc. - Chicken Fillet Mealbox ???. Comes with rice, egg, etc.  Hardworking and wonderful owners who have something unique to offer. Not just another Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"The worst chinese food. It seems they are using the cheapest chicken. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good tasting. We got chicken wings, pork chop rice, chicken noodles. Milk tea is not good though"}
{"text":"Really good Taiwanese food in Charlotte. I tried the popcorn chicken, bubble tea and fired chicken meal. They have hot pot buffet too."}
{"text":"HO-LY-DELICIOUS! Omg...what just happened in my mouth? Flavorgasm..gasm...gasm...(fade out).  I've been smizeing my eyes at the place for many months now and decided to check it out for lunch today. I feel bad for the old me that didn't know what she was missing for the past 6 months, however, that is no longer the case!  Firstly, service was awesome. When I first walked in, there was a patron that proclaimed that she is a regular. She suggested that I try the mega chicken filet or the Fried pork chop. But ummmm...Jay-Z said it best, \"no pork on my fork.\" I don't eat the swine, so this is what I got:  Basil Popcorn Chicken-this completely knocked my socks off. I took a bite and simultaneously drooled a bit. You know when something is so delicious that you pause for a second, as if the food is talking, and you look at that yummy morsel like it's a small alien? That happened. The flavors were so well balanced. It was salted perfectly and had several other seasons that I can't necessarily call out individually. The balance was real. It was hot out the fryer and the chicken was extremely juicy. The basil was just kind of thrown in, so it didn't really add any additional dimensions to the dish.  Unagi Mealbox-I'm a huge fan of eel. This was sweet, melty, and buttery. The eel was an impressive size as it resembled a nice sized fish filet. It was accompanied by perfectly cooked steamed rice, although I think you could  get fried rice as an alternative with an up-charge, pickled mustard greens, and a cold cabbage salad thingy. It all went well together. The mustard greens and cabbage could have used a bit of salt, but I have a salty palette. Either way the flavor was there and the pickled veggies cut the fatty coating the eel can leave in the moth. I'm talking heavenly fatty coating, not in a gross way.  Mega Fried Chicken-I just ordered the individual fillet off of the small bites portion of the menu. I got it in the garlic pepper flavor, which was ok. It was missing that salty perfection that came on the popcorn chicken, which was in the original flavor.  I plan on showing my face at this establishment at least every 2 weeks or more frequently.  Plz plz plz check this spot out and you muuuuust try the basil popcorn chicken! You're welcome. :)"}
{"text":"After trying for weeks to get my wife to come, we finally got to check out China Go Go. The first good sign as we entered the restaurant was the two tables of Chinese families and the two screens of Chinese television on the wall. Both signs of good things to come (read: real Chinese food).   My wife and I both ordered the Chinese hot pot. It had been many years since we last had hot pot in Taiwan. I tried to keep my expectations in check. I need not have worried.   China Go Go is 100% legit. The hot pot was fantastic. We split the soup base, with my wife ordering Szechuan and me ordering Tom Yum. Yum indeed. My mouth experienced real Chinese flavors I hadn't tasted in years. My wife was able to get her Chinese swerve on, eating taro root, black fungus, fish balls and tofu skins. I had plenty of baby boy choi, spinach, clams and mussels in mine.   The service was great. Our attentive waiter came numerous times to check on us and bring extra goodies for the pot. One of the owners also came by to check on us.   Yes, it's a little on the pricy side--$21.95 a person. But you can order as much food to put in your hot pot as your heart desires. But be careful--waste any food and they will charge you extra. (Smart policy.)  All in all a great place for authentic Chinese hot pot. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The best Chinese style fried chicken ever!  Also, Drunken spare ribs meal box is must try!  Everything else is also very good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Taiwanese/Chinese food, this is the right place. They offer traditional mealbox (Taiwanese bento box), Taiwanese burger, and also Americanized Chinese dishes. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you receive. Try the bento box, you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I've always gone to another hot pot place closer to where I lived but a friend highly recommended China Go Go so I had to try. At the end of my meal, I was so impressed. They had their regular menu with homestyle Chinese food, a hot pot menu, and a boba tea menu. I got the lychee green tea and it was so refreshing. We opted for hot pot tonight but will be back for the regular menu food in the future. We got the dual pot with house broth and tom yum broth and it was delicious. The flavor was so savory. The vegetables and meats were fresh. What impressed me the most aside from the delicious food was the service. They always checked on us and were so generous and kind. We just felt really welcomed to be there and the made our experience all the difference. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I were excited to try a new Chinese place. After looking over the menu I decided on the combination fried rice and she went with the sweet and sour chicken. My fried rice was pretty standard for a Chinese take out place,  nothing that I'll crave in the future. Now as far as the sweet and sour chicken...horrible. I've had better at the shady looking china buffet after its set out for hours. The chicken looked like nuggets from McDonald's and the sweet and sour was just a nasty jello like gob. Maybe others have had better luck but this was my experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food that took over an hour to be delivered when they said 20 minutes.  I even called after 45 mins and they said they were on their way.  This place is right down the street.  Either the delivery guy got lost, took some other orders first, or that was a complete lie.  An apology would have gone a long way.  That said, the only other Chinese place that delivers to me has an 86 sanitation grade, even with the 2 bonus points from serve safe.  Ewww."}
{"text":"What to say - not too shabby. (Hard working) family owned/operated. I stopped in for a quick lunch, first time there, had steamed pork dumplings. Nothing \"wow\" about them - they were certainly good. For me, what set them apart from others were the dumplings were served with a red pepper dipping sauce! Felt like I was back home in N.Y.C.! I'll definitely order again when I'm back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  This was the first time I had hot pot since traveling to China over 10 years ago and it took me back there.  This place is great for the food adventurers.  I was the only one of our family that actually ordered the hot pot but everyone was extremely happy with their food and beverages.   Teas are extraordinary and they even have a special touch for the hot chocolate for the kids.  I am so glad this place is close to home."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time got the pork belly bao combo. Delicious. Pickled greens were a first as well as the bao and was pleasantly surprised by the pickled greens. Today...I finally took the plunge and went for the hot pot. I've been putting it off for years having to partake alone and didn't think i could handle it. I was right. Although there wasn't a morsel of meat or seafood leftover, I had to leave behind a small amount of veggies, and sadly, all of the delicious ramen. Next time I'll know how to order. But for 21.95 I had a great experience. The staff are lovely people and the lady who took my order very helpful. Everything was very fresh, including the shrimp, squid, mussels and clams. I've researched hot pots all over charlotte, and I would say that this restaurant has the best value. I highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tonight was my 2nd visit.  The 1st visit was very good.  This time not so much. I ordered crab Rangoons.  They were warm inside and crispy outside. We also got the spring rolls. Crispy but inside bland.  Our main dish was sesame chicken. Half Lo-Mein. The other fried rice. The noodles have a bad aftertaste and they were very dry. The fried rice was just ok. I'm a little disappointed because the first visit I really enjoyed.  I probably won't return. Sorry"}
{"text":"We weren't exactly sure what to expect when we went to China Go Go. We live in the area, but had never seen a sign or even noticed the shopping center it's in--it's pretty obscure. We happened to find it online and tried it out. We're glad we did! This place offers authentically-favored, well-cooked Chinese food, which is limited in the Charlotte area.  The basil popcorn chicken was a highlight. The chicken was among the best I've ever had--crunchy, with the interior still moist, well-seasoned and satisfying. The basil leaves were lightly fried and crunchy in themselves. Not just an accompaniment to the chicken, they were really good in their own right.  My wife ordered the ribs. They were crispy and the meat fell easily off the bone. It had a bite but was still moist. I had two bao: the \"Original Pork Bun\" and the \"Sriracha Bao.\" I was afraid, upon seeing the cut, that the fat in the original pork bun would be chewy--but it wasn't. It was very tender and sweet; perhaps a little too sweet, but not terribly. The Sriracha Bao, I think, was a little less successful. It needs a second flavor element, as I found it a little flat. Both had extremely fresh and fluffy buns.  I hope, next time we visit, that we'll see more people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  Had the hot pot and pork buns and they did not disappoint.  Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.  The staff and restaurant were both very clean.  Go Go eat here!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time experience having hot pot at a restaurant and they did an amazing job as a first timer! We had the twin hot pot with tom yum and miso which were both very flavorful. All the veggies were nice and fresh and the meat was frozen but I'm not complaining. The price for adults is 21.95 which is not bad at all. Service was good and they always checked on us even though we were too busy dumping everything in the pot.  I love this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was excited about giving this popular little Asian joint a try for lunch while waiting for my clothes to dry at the nearby laundromat. It was either now or maybe never, as I am rarely in the area.   I was encouraged immediately by the fact that I was the only non-Asian among the the other ten or so customers. My server was also very friendly, but things went downhill quickly after she took my order of a chicken Bao, fries and fountain drink for $6.49. Bao is a special type of steamed bun, common in Teipei, but rare in Charlotte.  First of all, it took about 15 minutes for my order to arrive. My server apologized and everything looked and tasted delicious, that is, until I found what I first thought to be a two inch piece of black string. I pulled it out only to discover that it was a foot long piece of black hair totally embedded in the chicken. I showed the server and she apologized and asked if I'd like another. (Huh?!) I smiled and said jokingly that I did \"but without the hair.\" We both laughed and I had her pack it up to go. Unfortunately, I was out of time but had lost my appetite anyway. What I did eat was very good. It may seem to strange pair it with fries but they were actually excellent as reported in other Yelp reviews.  Other than the apology, I was offered no discount and that would have helped. There's one last thing, the place was hot and stuffy inside. I can only imagine how uncomfortable it would be in the summer. The overall sanitary rating was a 94.5.  So-o-o, will I be back? Probably not,  which is too bad, because I think it has a lot going for it. Just too much to forget."}
{"text":"Pretty good place here. New spot and very quality food. Good came fresh to order and was hot and fresh. My buddies and I came for lunch and enjoyed ourselves. I will come here again the next time I come to Charlotte.   Prices are decent as well. I paid $6.95 for my meal, with the drink. I'm very well pleased with everything.   A+++"}
{"text":"Went for the all you can eat hot pot. But I was refused since I went there at 9:00pm and they close at 10:00pm. And I was advised the an hour was just not enough time for that.   So I ate things off the regular menu.  I had the braised pork belly which was not all that great."}
{"text":"What a gem!  I had noticed this place when they were under construction and thought it was just going to be another chinese take out place.  I've never been so glad to be mistaken!  Food - 5/5 - This is the only place in Charlotte that I've been to that has \"Taiwanese\" as a yelp label, and it is actually true.  Beef noodle soup, seasoned chicken cutler, and black pepper steak.  All were delicious and very reminiscent of the food I get when I travel to Taiwan.  Almost everything I've had here was exceptional.  The only criticism I have is that the noodles in the beef noodle soup was a bit mushy (but the quality of the beef and taste of the broth made up for it).  Also, the bubble tea boba were extremely mushy, which was disappointing.  I still give it a 5 based on the quality and execution of the other dishes.  Atmosphere - 3/5 - Nothing special.  It's in a strip mall, but feels like a lot of places in Asia in that it is functional and effective.  Staff - 4/5 - Very helpful staff.  Value - 3.5/5 - Food was fairly priced.  Looking forward to coming here a lot in the future!"}
{"text":"OMG, what a gem! This is the restaurant worthy of the 45 mins driving to me. Authentic yummy Taiwan taste (flavorful, good spicy not scorching hot). Great variety of choices. I have not tried all their food yet. But over time I will:-) The family running the restaurant are super nice. Love everything about this place. I am not from Taiwan but this place makes me like Taiwan more. The other Chinagogo near huntersville serves American Chinese food. But if you want to check out the taste of Taiwanese food, come here.--- from a return customer."}
{"text":"The dish is excellent! It's very traditional Taiwanese food in this city. The service is really great too. They are helpful and friendly. I will come back!!"}
{"text":"Really authentic Asian food. Granted they have the basic American-Chinese dishes, but in this area they would not survive without. That being said i've never had bad food from this restaurant. Lo-mein noodles actually have a great chew to them and feel house made. All the proteins, including the shrimp have great flavor. Having eaten inside more than once, while you might be the only table in the restaurant as I have more than once, still phenomenal service and quality. I feel bad that more people aren't packed in this restaurant. Very bright and clean inside with authentic Asian artwork, tv programs, and great high ceilings. Just overall a great place, with incredible food quality and friendly, honest service."}
{"text":"Got the basil popcorn chicken and spicy chicken to go. Both were really good! I'll definitely be back to try something else. Glad there's finally a good Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"China go-go... don't be turned off by the simple and relatively awkward decor. This place has traditional Asian flavors you don't find in many places in Charlotte. From the pickled veggies to the pork belly... this place has very authentic flavors. Though this may turn some people off, I found it to be pretty comforting. My favorite buns were the pork belly, eel and spicy soft shell crab (get it extra spicy).   The service is good and the value is outstanding."}
{"text":"We come here on a Monday. I had the braised pork belly dish. The food is good, staff is friendly, but the ac isn't working very well. It's ok if you have regular food but if you order hot pot then good luck to you."}
{"text":"Very clean place. I'm here for dinner so it's cooked to order. They have a lunch buffet. I noticed they have a 95.5 rating for sanitation.  I'll report back after my dinner at the hotel."}
{"text":"Update after 5 months since my last review we've ate here a handful of times & haven't been disappointed. Still haven't used delivery so I'm unsure on all that. However, my new love {& I'm shocked to say this} is the steak & peppers!!! I've tried it different places before & hate it. This place does it to perfection. Just thought I'd share:)  Ordered from here twice as takeout, never used delivery. We always stick to the same things when ordering Chinese. Crab Rangoon, general tsos chicken, shrimp lo mein, & steamed dumplings. Nothing has been bland either time. Very tasty! Lots of places over cook the Rangoon & you can't eat the edges but they haven't done that here. Only thing I'm not a fan of is the breaded shrimp in the lo mein & that's because I never liked breaded shrimp...lol The noodles are really good. So far so good"}
{"text":"We love this place. The hospitality from the owner. The taste of the great food. The surprise from those off menu items. Most of all the quality and authenticity of the Tai Wan food. We suggest you shall give a try at least."}
{"text":"Last year, I spent a few days in Taipei and managed to get addicted to bao. Bao are a special sort of steamed bun stuffed with stuff and they're not usually easy to find done right in the US. I did not have high expectations, being halfway around the world, but I knew that I had to give it a try.  China Go Go does have Bao on the menu and while the bao themselves are quite traditional, being on a plate with french fries and a pot of ketchup seemed odd. I got over it as I ate through this goodness.  I had two, the \"Neighborhood Bird\" which was a flattened and battered chicken breast on a bao with lettuce and tomato and cucumber with a sweet honey mustard sauce. The chicken was excellent, I don't know about the sauce. The \"Original Pork\" was way better. Braised pork with cilantro and peanuts and pickled mustard greens. Very close to what I had in Taipei. Really delicious.  Enjoyed my bao fix and already looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Very very good taste! It's traditional Chinese restaurant n love it very much! The price is reasonable n the owner is nice Taiwanese. Believe me, everything is recommended here! The environment is clean n comfortable with soft music. I will choose it again if I come to charlotte next time!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant ever! The food was great. I got the beef lo mein and it was amazing! It had so much flavor. Everything else was great, too. Our waitress told us what was the best.(according to everyone else) The waitress also took account of my sons nut allergy. There wasn't many people there, which was surprising because the food was so amazing! So, our food came fast. I think the service was fast for the few people that were there. There was a light that was flickering, so me and my son moved to another table. It was not terribly annoying, though. That was the only con out of all the pros. The price is amazing! For $8, you can buy what is equal to two meals. Many other Asian restaurants are very expensive. Overall, this is     an amazing restaurant and I would like to go there again sometime.  UPDATE: RUN for the Taiwanese hot pot OMG it's awesome...get the shaved beef and Szchewan soup wowza!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a weekday and had possibly the most authentic Taiwanese meal I've ever had in Charlotte. Don't shy away from the braised pork belly. The accompanying mustard greens were fantastic as well."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! Every time I order for delivery they exceed expectations. Adding drinks, doubling my order and all sorts of great customer appreciation. Legit ordered 8 spring rolls after hours and they delivered 18 spring rolls and two drinks. 100% quality! Go go go!!"}
{"text":"You can get typical americanize chinese food here for pretty cheap, like $6 and some change for pepper steak and onion with fried ir white rice and $5 some change foe mixed veg. Has boba tea, which is around $3.50 for a standard small milk tea with boba.  Cute little shop, nothing lavish. When you enter, it was confusing where to even order and where the menu is. Don't bother looking for a menu on the wall, there isn't one. You would have to use their printed menus.  When I was doing a take out here, I saw a party having hot pot here, which was confusing because I didn't see hot pot on the menu.  The food came out really fast, my only complaint was the take out containers could have been better than the typical styrofoam boxes because the sauce from my meals leaked all over the brown paper bag. If it makes any difference to you, they do give you the nicer version of the brown bags with a handle.  4 stars because service was courteous, food came out fast and the food tasted pretty good. I really hope this place survives!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found this restaurant!!!! The mega chicken reminds me of the fried chicken that is all the rage in Taiwan now  the basil chicken is also delicious. Both the pepper steak and pork belly over rice was a perfect mix with the preserved vegetables and tea egg. Seriously this is one of those authentic restaurants that cater well to people who aren't used to food that is too \"exotic\" (try the mega chicken) and to people who want the real thing (pork belly over rice). I can't wait to come back and try other dishes !! They also offer hotpot and it looks really good too."}
{"text":"Loved their hotpot and bubble tea!  The hotpot was all you can eat and the meat were sliced delicately well. They had a pretty good variety of veggies and protein too. There was even an option to get low sugar bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Co-workers suggested Chinese for lunch and that pretty much ended the conversation... Ample parking in a shared lot in the plex with easy in and out from Statesville or W.T.Harris. Clean comfortable space dominated by a well appointed bar. Tables down the left side and two smallish dining rooms on the right, no idea what's going on next door. Greeted with an eggroll! how cool is that?! Never quite got around to eating it but no complaints from the other guys. Asked for hot tea and Kimchi wings to start. Wings didn't have the distinct flavor and aroma of chicken dipped in super-charged garlic infused oriental sauerkraut. Kinda good but kinda dry, comes with ranch dip and some celery to health you up. On the other hand the General's Chicken was delightful. Light, crisp breading on tender meats in a zippy brown sauce with broccoli and your choice of white or fried rice. Why not have some fun and get some hot mustard too!? Just a little dunky-dip and your world comes alive: warmth that starts in your belly and blooms in your sinuses. Ahhh... lunch with the General."}
{"text":"Great soup and noodles, and wonderful service. I got beef noodles, and wasn't a fan of the beef chunks, but great flavor of soup. Everything came out hot.  Clean tables and floor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. I ordered takeout 30 minutes before close which was cutting it close. They were efficient, friendly, and did not sacrifice on food quality. I'll be a repeat visitor to this hidden gem. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! The hot pot here was soo delicious. We got the Tom yum and the House broth. The house broth was so good, we didn't even touch the Tom yum. The owners were super sweet too. Great place!"}
{"text":"First time here .. take out type place but I thought the food was a notch above other takeouts. Got the Mongolian beef with lo mein noodles and it was great. Crab rangoons were tasty.. nice folks , i enjoyed the meal.."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot.  Had a great time with the hotpot.  Staffs are friendly.  Price is decent.  Knock off a star because the tapioca drink is subpar.  Will be back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Very good Taiwanese food. Have had their spicy chicken, pork chop, and pork belly combos. They have a bunch of other traditional taiwanese dishes such as taiwanese fried chicken and gua bao. Everything is delicious and priced right. You get loads of food with each combo. Definitely a great deal. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Oh, the power of Yelp.  Found this place while looking for something to eat and being Taiwanese, I was instantly attracted to it.  Original Pork Bun - I think it's a combination of things, but I just didn't enjoy it. It may have been because of the pickled mustard greens or the fact that the pork belly wasn't as tender as I would have liked.     Popcorn Chicken - After reading a lot of recommended reviews for this item, we gave it a shot.  It didn't disappoint but I feel like some type of dipping sauce should accompany it.    Black Pepper Steak - Awesome dish.  The sauce was wonderful and the portion size was good.    Milk Tea with Grass Jelly - Tasted great and comes in a huge glass mug.  I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a new place to try and/or you're tired of the Americanized Chinese restaurants around every corner."}
{"text":"My husband and I we're really looking forward to the new Chinese restaurant. We went on a Friday night. The place was empty but there was loud talking and cooking sounds coming from the kitchen as if the place was packed. I order sesame chicken with lo main and soup. My husband ordered beef and broccoli.  We waited forever for our food, again we were the only people in there. The food arrived in take out containers , which was fine however the food was hot , temperature hot, it was inedible . We waited a while and blew on it to cool down, still it was scorching hot. I burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat a piece of chicken .  The food was BLAND so my efforts were for nothing . My husbands food was just as bland and tasteless.  Then they brought us out soup which again was to hot even after blowing on it.  I'm sure there is a health violation for serving food at 900 degrees . I think the only way to get the food that hot is by a microwave . We won't be back ever. China Go Go is China No No."}
{"text":"This my first time at China Go Go and I did not know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the food and the flavors.  We ordered the Hot Pot which was great.  You can choose from various proteins, vegetables, etc.  You must try the Basil Pop Corn Chicken.  It is delicious.  The Bible tea was great.  We had the Three Brothers and the Mango/Passion Fruit flavors.  Service was great and fast.  Excellent Food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in CLT!! Delicious food and drinks. Pork belly bun and boba tea are delicious. Must try them!"}
{"text":"Pretty legit Taiwanese joint, down to the Taiwanese news/shows that they were showing on the TV.  Lol.  Food is pretty standard Taiwanese fare: braised pork belly, either in bao or on rice, fried pork chop, popcorn chicken, etc.  They also offer a few of the usual American Chinese choices such as xxx and broccoli, general Tso, Lo mein, and etc. as well.  But if you're here, I would highly suggest that you at least try the more traditional options as they do it pretty well here.  There are plenty of other places that can do American Chinese...  Price was decent and the kitchen banged out food pretty quick.  Fair enough since most options are either on fryer or already braised and ready to go.  Definitely a solid option for lunch."}
{"text":"This food was so good!   The curried chicken had so many fresh, crisp vegetables and perfectly seasoned chicken in it.  And the Boba Tea was outstanding.  The best boba I have ever had.  The only thing that was not so great with this food, was the chicken egg roll.  The egg roll tasted like it had hard bits in it.    Although the establishment only had a 90 score on their sanitation, the place looked spotless to me!    They play this music that made dining in seem nightmarish.  It sounds like a bunch of cats in a bag meowing and clawing to get out.  You can hear it in the background of the video I took.  Listen for yourself.    The prices were great!  A curry chicken meal was only $6.50 and the chicken egg roll was $1.50.  The next time I am in this area, I will be stopping in again."}
{"text":"It's good for North Carolina Chinese food I'm from New York it don't taste the same but is good"}
{"text":"Such delicious food and a nice staff. Came here today for lunch and I must say this is the best Taiwanese food I've had since visiting Taiwan. The food was made delicious and came out nice and hot. We had the popcorn Chicken and a pork belly plate. Also the eel plate but I forgot to take a picture. It looked too good so I ate it. I highly recommend this place.if you aren't familiar with Taiwanese food, don't be scared. It's delicious."}
{"text":"New spot in the Smith Corners Area. Truth be told, I was anxiously awaiting their opening because I don't have a Chinese carry out in my neighborhood that I will visit anymore. The one I had used previously, I have stopped dining at due to a low health rating.   So we were in the area and we stopped in for dinner. Upon entry, they greeted us and explained their specials and the menu. It is not a typical menu that you will find at another Chinese carry out. Limited menu but they do offer bao. The setup looks like they will be cafeteria style because they have a buffet line right when you walk in but they did cook our food fresh. I should have asked if that is what they are going to do in the future.  They do have a few booths but I would see this as more a carry out place. It was a bit warm inside and did not make for a pleasant dining experience.  So we ordered the following:  Chicken Potstickers - These are probably a frozen variety but they were good. Chicken inside was moist and flavorful. Hints of ginger and lemongrass.  Chicken wings - Fried to perfection but seriously bland.  Chicken and Broccoli with Lo Mein Noodles - This was actually really good. It was a nice balance of sauce and broccoli and meat. The broccoli still had a nice crunch to it without being too under. I typically don't enjoy lo mein noodles because they are often bland and oily. However, China GO GO uses the thin noodles, which I enjoyed and had flavor to it. My son actually really enjoyed this dish too.   Pork Bell Bao - The bun was soft and perfect, the pork belly was melt in your mouth soft but this overall was sweet. It needed something to balance it out - maybe some more mustard greens. The mustard greens on it were not the crunchiest and could have been more sour.  Don't get me wrong - it was good, just a bit sweet for me. In the end I am very excited about being able to get bao's in my neighborhood now. I had ordered my bao with a side salad and they ended up serving it with onion rings. I told them it was okay, they didn't have to fix it. We would eat the onion rings. Which were good. But they still fixed it, they brought out my side salad which was very fresh and topped with a nice refreshing dressing.   They have a nice bao selection and I am anxious to come back and try. While there on our visit they had a picture of Asian shaved ice dessert and we asked if they had that too. They told us no, but that they do plan to have in the next few weeks. If this is true - I will gladly be a regular visitor.   In the end, it was good eats. Definitely a good solid three. I will be back to try more of the bao's that they offer.  The menu says they deliver. I will eventually take them up on that."}
{"text":"Awesome place for hot pot or American Chinese at its best. The customer service is above and beyond great! The interior is modern and clean with some comfortable seating, but this place also works a big take out game! The food is always freshly prepared to order. We have not tried the hot pots yet but the menu looks amazing."}
