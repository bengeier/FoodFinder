{"text":"First time going to this fast food restaurant. We are actually impressed! We didn't know what to expect from a Ta√Øwanaise food court food. The pop corn chicken, beef and octopus were crispy even after we brought it home. Everything came separated in a plate and that keeps the food from getting soggy. The food was really good. We took the combo with miso soup. The miso was good and it wasn't too salty. We would go back there again"}
{"text":"Actually thoroughly impressed with the food. Most of the newly opened taiwanese fried chicken places downtown were meh for me. The chicken here is tender, flavourful, just the right crispiness, and has surprisingly large portion. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really was not impressed with this place. I had high expectations since the menu items sounded so good. We ordered 2 bento boxes. They include rice with minced pork on top, vegetables, soup, kimchi, seaweed salad, and your choice of meat. Our chicken was hard and VERY HARD to chew. The cashier wasn't too nice to talk to either."}
{"text":"This place should be more popular! Their chicken is tender and fried real well.  And their bentos are large and delicious w lots and lots of different things in it.  The prices are pretty reasonable too.  I always bring ppl visiting downtown here and they always love it. The food packaging here is real nice too."}
{"text":"Cheers Cut!  I dropped by based on one of my yelper friend's review and I was super excited. Cheers Cut is a franchise that specializes in Taiwanese Fried Chicken. Like the other yelp review says, it is down the street from another fried chicken store but I would say they should not worry.  I got the Ninja Crispy Chicken bento box for $9.99 before tax. They ran out of the bento box containers so instead, they put it in individual containers for me. I had 4 boxes: rice (garnished with black sesame seeds), the fried chicken, miso soup, and the side dishes (cucumber, kimchi, seaweed salad, and danmuji - the yellow pickled radish).  For the rice, you can substitute with your own choice of base: white rice, minced pork rice, curry rice, or french fries. I would prefer if they had a choice to upgrade the base with sweet potato fries. But the meal, I found, was delicious! The smell of the freshly fried chicken was amazing- noted by my friend as well before I even opened it. The chicken was super crispy and there was a large portion. I got the teriyaki sauce which also complimented the deliciousss chicken! The sides were delicious as well, I would just say that the kimchi did not taste as authentic as regular kimchi but it hit the note.   I would definitely return, especially to try the other bento boxes as it filled me up. Their green/black tea also looks super good. I will be returning. :)"}
{"text":"Cheers Cut is located at Yonge Street and close to Gerrard intersection at the New World Mall food court where there are some other popular food shops too.  I hadn't heard too much about Cheers Cut before this so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It took around 10 minutes for the chicken to be freshly fried but it was incredibly worth it.  The 12 oz Samurai Chicken (XXL) was served in a flat paper carton and quite huge!  I'm glad that the staff member gave me a tray to set the chicken on because it was very hot from the fryer!  He also gave me some plastic gloves too.    It was seriously the best piece of fried chicken cutlet I have ever had in my life to date. It was made of 100% chicken breast meat and fried to order. The best parts of it: Super crispy, crunchy batter that didn't overpower the chicken at all.  The batter was so minimal and had the best mixture of pepper flavour ever.  It was just perfect!  Secondly, the chicken meat was incredibly firm, tender, and moist!  I couldn't believe how amazingly delicious it was.  Mmm.  I was super uber impressed!  I took the rest of the chicken cutlet home to enjoy and even after reheating it to eat a day after, it was still just as delicious (of course, the crispy skin wasn't as crispy anymore) but still.  It was amazing!"}
{"text":"After shutting the doors on my years of being a vegetarian, I have found fried chicken to be a unique gastric exploration.  My adventures mainly centered around Japanese and Korean fried chicken, but I had heard many raving reviews about TFC, Taiwanese fried chicken. My friends often talk about Hot Star, which many could consider to be Cheers Cut's direct competitor.  Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to try Hot Star, though it's definitely on my bucket list, so please take this review of Cheers Cut with this fact in mind as I will not be able to compare the two versions.   Cheers Cut is located inside a small food court near Yonge and Dundas. Co Co is next to it. Although the lineup inside is mainly for Co Co rather than Cheers Cut, it's advantageous in the sense that customers going for Co Co may be enticed to purchase fried chicken while lining up and fried chicken goers will have a drink option for them to sate their thirst while eating.    The workers at Cheers Cut are generally amiable and very helpful with guiding you through the menu.  You can purchase chicken strips (Ninja Chicken), large single slabs  of chicken, or bento sets. As such, Cheers Cut caters for all levels of hunger, whether you're in the mood for a snack, light meal, or full meal.    After consulting wirh the cashier, my friend and I purchased two Samurai Chickens.  The Samurai Chicken is the largest chicken item that doesn't come in a meal set and is considered to be their signature pick.  You also have to pick a Flavour and two Sauces.  We chose Chilli as our Flavour, and got three sauces instead of two because our cashier was being generous when we couldn't decide on two.  We had to wait about ten minutes for our order as they fry the chicken on the spot, which is a bonus because you get freshly made food.  When our  orders arrived, they were individually sealed in cardstock packages with katana print so that we could eat them on the go (think of eating a McDonald's apple pie while walking). They were also placed into plastic bags with a samurai decal. In fact, Cheers Cut is a heavy hitter with the whole samurai aesthetic, as their shop has a giant samurai cut out and all their items are themed accordingly.  My friend and I enjoyed the aesthetic as a comedic gimmick since it had no correlation to fried chicken itself. Also, although there are instructions printed on the packaging to help you unwrap the cardstock in a way that would make eating the chicken on the go easier, the cardstock itself is difficult to maneuver and rip.  In all honesty, you can ditch the instructions as they won't help you with this type of material - you'll figure it out.   Now onto the chicken itself.  Yes, it was large in portion size and steaming hot from being fresh out of the fryer.  Thankfully, it wasn't dripping with oil, but despite being freshly fried, I found the skin to be a let down. The skin wasn't tough, but it also wasn't crispy. Furthermore, the flesh was somewhat juicy, but unlike chicken from other vendors, it toughened when the chicken became lukewarm.  We had chosen Chilli for our Flavour because we wanted spiciness, but that was no where to be found, though it was obvious from the colour of the skin that the chicken was seasoned.  The sauces were the most mediocre part of it all; all of them had an artificial undertone to them and they didn't harmonize well with the chicken. If you come here, keep the chicken naked.   Overall, there is nothing to write home about. The price to portion ratio just breaks even since you're paying 10 dollars for a large portable slab of chicken. The texture is underwhelming and this is emphasized even more when the chicken cools down and when the bones start showing themselves at the bottom of the slab. You won't get spicy chicken here and it's best to avoid the sauces no matter how much you want to add flavour/spiciness to the somewhat bland flesh."}
{"text":"One star for the fried octopus. The other star for the service. The overall taste of the food is not impressive at all......."}
{"text":"This place was an impulse stop on my way home from shopping, and I'm glad I tried it!   I ordered the Ninja Crispy Chicken bento box for $10.99. The prices are fair for the portions, I was happy and full after eating 2/3 of it.  The side dishes were seaweed salad, raw veggies, pickled radish and kimchi. All the side dishes were store-bought premade, but it's still good.  The chicken was crispy and juicy.   You have many types of rice to choose from, at no extra cost so I was pretty happy with that! I got the minced pork rice, and it's basically white rice topped with minced pork in black bean sauce. The sauce reminded me a lot of jjajiangmyun (or zhajiangmian).  I chose the chili oil sauce for the chicken, and I would rather try a different sauce next time. Something just seemed off about the sauce (too chemical-y?).  Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! And the staff is super friendly. Also loved the grapefruit tea drink.. big portions at good prices."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 2.5 stars, but forced to choose 2 or 3, I'm going with 2.  I was excited to try this place - I'm a big fan of Hot Star and other Taiwanese and Korean Fried Chicken places in the neighbourhood.  The bento boxes are good in theory - the price is reasonable and the different side dishes are nice, although I found the kimchi to be surprisingly bland. I'm not even sure how you make kimchi bland, but they've managed it.  I ordered the combo so I could give everything a try, but the chicken and beef were both really dry. The squid was a bit better, but was still pretty rubbery. I asked for it spicy but except for the fact that a few pieces were orange, I couldn't really tell that they had added any spice. Overall, it was edible, but pretty disappointing - I think I'd rather pay a few bucks more and get Hot Star."}
{"text":"My Favorite to go place for Ninja or Popcorn chicken. Usually order from here. The Lemon Black tea is delicious and comes in a 1000ML for $5. The food comes out pretty fast and is delicious. The extra sauces to choose from is good. My favorite is the Teriyaki but also Honey Mustard but it has been out of stock for 3 months this popular sauce should be restocked ASAP. The service is good and there is 4 other foodies in this place like Coco Fresh Tea and Thai Express. Great foodie place"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for an amazing/extremely fast fried chicken? NOPE, this place definitely gets 5 starts from me! I stopped by this little.....well, whatever you want to call this, it's basically in a little mini food court with 5 things in it, either way I originally stopped by to get something completely different but once I saw that beautiful chicken I knew I needed to eat it a couple of dozen times, so why not start now? I ordered the big samurai (or something along those lines). My only previous Taiwanese fried chicken experience comes from the many times I've had Hot Star down the street so I was pretty nervous/excited at how this place would be compared to it. The food took maybe 10 minutes to come out and when I opened the bag my big fried crispy piece of chicken was staring back at me as glorious as it possibly could. When I took my first bite I immediately fell in love with this place, the chicken has so much flavour, was juicy, and did I mention very very large? Because it is all of those things. I highly recommend Cheers Cut to anyone looking for a quick but amazing meal on the go while hanging out downtown, you absolutely will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Have tried this place 3 times in the past few weeks. I've only had it via ubereats so can't speak to how it tastes in store. However, I've enjoyed it all three times. I order the ninja chicken with the minced pork rice and my boyfriend gets the popcorn chicken with curry rice. The ninja chicken comes in several flavors and I've tried pepper and chili but prefer pepper. The chicken (even on delivery) is very juicy and well flavoured. It's awesome that this place offers minced pork rice at the same charge and not just plain rice. The box also comes with a miso soup (average), seaweed salad, kimchi (don't like this, doesn't taste fresh) and a sauce of your choice. It's well priced at $11 for the food. We've also ordered the lemon black tea which is a gigantic 1L juice that's only $5! It tastes like Hong Kong lemon iced tea. Would recommend this place and will likely go try their samurai chicken (supposedly crisper)."}
{"text":"I actually came here right after trying Hot Star next door (wanted to compare the chicken). I didn't end up ordering the comparable large fried chicken, but I did get the Exploding Fried Chicken (has cheese in it) and the fish cake. The fish cake is cut into wedges and fried--pretty damn good, considering I've never had fish cake that way. A bit greasy--I could feel my arteries dying halfway through these guys hahaa. The chicken was reallllly hot (in a good way) but it also makes it a bit hard to eat because the cheese is also so hot (caution:may burn tongue accidentally). The chicken was a bit tougher than Hot Star next door and the cheese was a bit sweet? But all in all, pretty delicious."}
{"text":"It's nice to see another Taiwanese food place opened in Downtown. Don't get me wrong I like Hot Star but to make it combo is pretty expensive. At least you can get the Ninja Crispy Chicken bento for about $11 and it will for sure fill you up."}
{"text":"I was a skeptic reading all the negative reviews, but the quality of the food makes me comfortably say it was well worth it. We ordered the exploding chicken and the house combo bento. It was a bit pricey for food court food but I was very happy with my meal. The exploding chicken wait was long, at least a solid 10-15mins... the end result was DELICIOUS, worth every second. The batter was very special, bright yellow with a beer batter like thickness, but very very crunchy - was a hard crunch that made a loud sound. Also very well seasoned and delicious, the flavouring was distinct from regular Taiwanese fried chicken, you can taste it's a unique house blend. Chicken itself is moist and juicy, cheese oozed out (slightly not molten enough) extremely was very delicious and I would love to come back for this. House combo bento was okay, the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, beef chunks and squid were good but nothing out of the ordinary for Taiwanese fried food. The sides were very underwhelming, cold veggies and some cold sauce package. Only thing worth noting is the mince pork rice. The pork belly was well seasoned and tender, definitely better than most Taiwanese offerings. I think the bento wasn't too worth it, but I would 100% come back for the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Chi Chop! is located in a storefront with a few other restaurants on the corner of Yonge (west side) and Walton (just before Gerrard). Among others, you'll find a bubble tea shop and a philthy's in this same location.  I ordered the ninja crispy chicken bento box which comes with freshly fried chicken, rice of choice (pork rice was my choice), dipping sauce (I chose honey mustard), a few pieces of veggies (1 broccoli, 2 cucumber and kimchi) and seaweed salad and miso soup. Usually I really like bento boxes because of the variety you end up with but nothing in this besides the pork rice stood out as great. The chicken is lightly battered and fried, nice and crispy, but I found it to be on the greasy side. They use dark meat, which I generally prefer, but not in this manner. It made the meat feel fatty and unappetizing in the mouth. The pork rice was delicious, I'd order that all on its own next time! The sides were nothing worth writing home about - seaweed salad is what you'd expect. Didn't touch the soup. The dipping sauce was kind of gross, I like honey mustard, but this was overpowering and took over my mouth whenever I dipped the chicken into it. Pass on that particular sauce, there were a few other choices that would be better. Finally, the chicken was quite salty, so much that I only ate half of it.   On a side note, I found the layout of the menu confusing. You don't get to pick 3 sides, you just get what you're given, so I don't know why they specified that on the menu. Despite asking about a drink, she said no, and then the next customer got a different answer because out came a can of pop!   An ok meal for $12 but I won't return. I've had better bento boxes than this one and despite the convenient location, I'll stop at one of the other eateries in this storefront before I come back here."}
{"text":"More competition is always good! Cheers Cut is the latest entrant to the Taiwanese Fried Chicken fast food scene in downtown Toronto.  Unlike the others, Cheers Cut is located in a shared foodcourt-esque space, which makes it more casual than others.  The specialty here is the extra large Samurai crispy Chicken, which is huge and comes in a handy carrying box. It is also a tad flatter than other places, but as a side effect this also increases the batter to chicken ratio which is great if you like that crispy batter. The taste is pretty on par with other fried chicken places.  There is also the \"exploding crispy chicken\", which is filled with cheese. Although I didn't try it this particular visit, it sounds good enough for me to want to come again to try it.  I highly recommend getting their grapefruit green tea, which was quite refreshing and paired well with the chicken.  Aside from fried chicken they also sell bento boxes as well, and quite well received just from comments that I hear around me.  Overall, Cheers Cut is an alright place (3 stars)"}
{"text":"One of the better places downtown for Taiwanese food. You definitely get the best bang for your buck here... I mean $10 for miso soup, seaweed salad, rice with curry or minced pork, and popcorn chicken? It is pretty hard to beat that...   In terms of flavor, I would give it a solid four out of five. The chicken was cooked and seasoned really well and the rice was blessed with the choice of curry or minced pork. A bento box might look small, but trust me... it is definitely enough to fill you up. This location comes to top of mind when I am looking for something good to eat on uber eats."}
{"text":"Quite impressed with this little stall! I decided to try one of their bentos and was surprised with the crispy and flavorful chicken.  I ordered the popcorn chicken rice bento which includes rice, some nice sides (kimchi, radishes, seaweed salad, and cucumber), your choice of sauce, and a big bowl of soup. I love how you can choose to customize the rice and sauce because I can always look forward to trying something new! The teriyaki sauce was a bit too salty with the already salty chicken so I actually liked it without. I chose the minced pork rice and noticed that they are very generous with the portions. Everything exceeded my expectation, especially the affordable prices! Only $10 for so much to eat, I always leave very full! They also sell big pieces of fried chicken just like Hot Star for a very good price, but it's HUGE, so make sure you bring a friend!  Overall, I love their super quick service as well as affordable bentos, will definitely visit often for a fuss free lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried the Ninja crispy chicken bento during their soft opening. The lineup was actually substantial during lunch.  Chicken is moist and crispy and the portion is HUGE. Also got the curry rice which was really good. The 3 salads are decent there is kim chee.  I tried the sichuan sauce with the chicken its NUMBING. So be careful.  Miso soup was good also. A nice fusion type fast food. Its so close to hot star though hope they can coexist."}
{"text":"Came here at around 3pm. The door by the intersection was blocked with people lining up for Coco so it's better to use the second door so you can visit the other food stalls. I ordered the ninja chicken bento box with pork minced rice and miso soup on the side. From what I observed, I noticed that I was the only customer and so food took a few minutes to make. I did not expect them to package everything as I was deciding to eat it to go anyways but they really wrapped it, cover, lid and all. The amount of chicken then gave was more than enough, which surprised me.   Now, onto the chicken! I have never had chicken this crispy before, that surprised me ever more. THEY DO NOT PLAY GAMES!!! Every single bite was like biting into a bunch of chips, the batter was that crunchy (totally not a bad thing). The chicken was extremely well marinated as the meat tasted sweet and fragrant. Sides consisted of pickled radish, kimchi, broiled brocolli, cucumber & seaweed salad. I highly recommend getting a bento box as just getting the chicken itself would be too much for me, good to have variety. As a big eater, I had some trouble finishing but successfully did after some time. Overall, I was satisfied and will definitely come back because it's at a good price and am always in the area."}
{"text":"I really liked the food I got from here. I ordered a bento box with popcorn chicken. This place is set up like a very small food court. You order your food and wait for it to be done then you find a table. The place gets pretty packed so finding a seat can be difficult. The food didn't take too long. The bento box came with the chicken, veggies, seaweed salad and miso soup all for $9.99. I thought that was a great deal for everything included. All aspects were very good. The popcorn chicken was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Opening time was listed as 12pm. I showed up around 11:50am. I was 3rd in line. Not bad. My order went in at around 12:04pm. I watched as other people, who ordered after me, receiving their food. I checked a few times. They kept saying that my order was on its way. I ordered 2 items. Finally walked out at 12:33pm. Over 30 minute wait for 2 items. They are clearly not cut out for fast food, and don't have a system in place. The samurai chicken was tasty, but not worth the wait. They need to clean up their act, or they will be out of business quickly."}
