{"text":"One of the best Caribbean restaurants in Toronto!    To me a good Caribbean restaurant is defined by the taste of the meat, not the gravy that goes on top of it. Thos being said, when I ask for extra oxtail gravy, they truly understands what this means :). The flavour of their meat, complimented by the gravy is to die for. This place is in the top 5 percentile for Caribbean food in all of Toronto in terms of authenticity, taste and general non stinginess (good portions).   I've had the jerk chicken dinner/Roti and jerk pork. All 3 are excellent. There is a good mixture of flavour in their recipe. If I were to explain it I would say a slight liquorice taste with herbs and a perfect amount of spiciness.    Overall a very big fan of this place. It's not a sit down restaurant more of a takeout joint. If you haven't tried it yet, check out the jerk pork which is by far the most flavourful of what I have tried.   Call ahead as service can be slow, albeit the employees are very nice, especially Mitzy herself."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  Researched online because I love carribean food..chose this place b/c near hotel and had good reviews....we ordered the oxtail, goat roti and patties.  Long story short...hair in my roti and the oxtail was dried up, not moist at all.  Only the patties were a success, but on the spicy side.  The hair was in the goat meat in my roti and truthfully, because I found it within the first few bites, it probably ruined the whole meal entirely.  Sorry, I know it happens, but made me wonder about hygiene altogether.  We are just visiting Toronto and did take out.  Did not want to go back for a replacement meal."}
{"text":"Got the jerk pork Roti for lunch.  Completely stuffed with awesome jerk pork. Could of used a lite more veg of some sort but still crazy good.  It was spicey but for me perfect. Hot enough to get my nose running but not crazy hot I need to take a drink to quench the heat!   I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"I'm rating this place a 4/4.5.  I've only been here twice and both times I've had the jerk chicken with rice/coleslaw, and the last time I was there I also had a patty and coco bun.  The serving sizes are excellent for the price and the jerk chicken is really delicious.  It is spiced perfectly and is so tender it just falls right off the bone.  The serving of rice is HUGE and is quite spicy to me (I have a low spice tolerance) but it's super good and I'm sure most people would like it.  The patty/coco bun was good although I wish there was a tad more filling in the patty.  Overall I really like this place and intend on trying other menu items in the future."}
{"text":"Probably best jerk I've had in the city! Lucky I found it while randomly at Islington for an errand. So tasty"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've tried almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the jerk chicken and the curry chicken. Falls right off the bone. The coleslaw is very tasty, and just the way I like it. Mitzi and the staff are very friendly and very accommodating.  The large portions are very large and could easily feed two. But I take it down. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Living in Scarborough all my life, I was very much looking forward to MItzie's as there are not many Jerk places in South Etobicoke. Unfortunately I was very disappointed!!!  The service was fine, lady at the counter was very nice.  But what you could see of the kitchen left me suspect.  After I ordered my Jerk and Oxtail dinner along with Beef soup, I heard microwave buttons. I was praying it was not my dinners but as I looked I could see them taking my food out of the microwave while it was already packed in the styrofoam containers. Health risk!  I sucked it up, only to try the soup and rice and peas only to get the strongest scent of cloves I have ever smelled in my life.  Then after 1 taste I nearly could not hold the rice in my mouth as it tasted like I just opened a jar of cloves and swallowed it! This is immensely disappointing for me as I really was hoping to have a place near my area to get authentic great tasting Jamaican food.   Maybe I got a bad batch, but there's absolutely NO EXCUSE for microwaving full dinners while in styrofoam containers!"}
{"text":"One of my main go to lunch places. The fried chicken or jerk special is always good in taste and value. If you need some good home made taste this is definitely the place for some Carribean food."}
{"text":"Best Jerk in town! The food is so good I had it at my Jack n Jill & the value was unbelievable.  Rice and beans are well seasoned and simple, just right. The jerk chicken can be a little too hot for a sensitive pallet, but the moist meat and flavors will win over any critic. For those who are not into heat I chose the stewed chicken, which is robust in flavour and an instant crowd pleaser. If you want lots of heat get the jerk pork (it has lots of bark). Back in the day when I could eat gluten I loved the lamb roti as a filling and delicious dinner, so good. Real food, no fluff, just hearty home cooked scrumptious eats. Enjoy frequently!"}
{"text":"I've really wanted to try more menu items,  but the jerk chicken patty sandwich is so delicious that I keep ordering the same thing!  The coco bun is light, soft and slightly sweet...a perfect cushion for the flaky patty, tender, juicy chicken and creamy coleslaw.  My mouth is always thankful for the soothing effects of that sweet, cool coleslaw. I could eat a pound of that coleslaw anytime. Mitzi's patty sandwich is a must."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's my favourite roti in the GTA.  Mitzie is very friendly and welcoming.  My favourite rotis are the jerk pork and goat."}
{"text":"Good portions, place has great food. Not a big fan of rotti's but I like the food here."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of Jamaican restaurants and some of the time the food is great but the attitude kills the experience.  I heard about this place and the customer service won me over even before I tried the food!  The friendliness was so good that it makes me want to go back just to converse with them.  Now onto the food, the curry goat was outstanding! The jerk pork was an 8/10, it had more of a sweet taste which wasn't bad but not too much to my liking.    I usually never post on these things but I had to because of the service alone (they even threw in extra meat and a coleslaw); some other Jamaican places you have to beg to get a coleslaw (Portland Jerk in Brampton).  Mitzies have a new customer for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered the jerk pork and jerk chicken. I actually checked the time in and out and it took an hour to get the food. The jerk pork was over charred and felt like I was eating the scrapes from the grill. The coleslaw is what did me in. It was more mayo and sugar than slaw and ended up throwing up from that. Never hitting up this place again.  Really poor layout too. It's designed as a takeout but you can clearly see their back-end is 20 times bigger for nothing. Everyone else who was waiting for an hour was just cramped in the front waiting for their food."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat!!!  Very friendly service. I now come to this place oftenly."}
{"text":"Generally I head to the 905 when craving jerk. On this day I was feeling lazy so I went into check out Mitzie's. It wasn't quite as good a my regular place but did offer decent jerk pork. The next time I went there we ordered the Curry goat dinner and the jerk pork sandwich. Yes I know you yardies out there are smirking at me. Traditionally jerk is eaten in combination with festivals which are corn based deep fried dumplings. Well let me tell you that the sweet creamy coleslaw and the jerk were a marriage made in heaven. It was balanced and over flowing with crunchy peppery goodness. I generally prefer authentic to fusion but this was simply so old that I overcame my bias. They also sell doubles  a fried chick pea dish normally found at Trinidadian roti shops. West Enders and those willing to trek West check it out"}
{"text":"Had a roti craving and was nearby according to my yelp search. Called in for takeout and was greeted cheerfully over the phone, ordered two curry chicken roti.  Very tasty freshly made roti. My two boys 3 and 5 loved it.  I will visit again and try other food from the menu."}
{"text":"Try Lunch Special for 6.25 if you are in the area! You get to choose Fried, stew, or jerk chicken with beverages.   We tried jerk and fried chicken and it was absolutely delicious! Jerk chicken was flavourful and pretty moist. Fried chicken is great choice if you are not keen on too much of spices. Its crispy and for some reason tasted homey.   I will definitely come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get food from this strip of Bloor. I've tried the chicken roti and the jerk chicken and loved both. Very tasty and generous portions for the price."}
{"text":"I came here because I wanted to try the K-Pop down the street and it's not open yet. Damn you, Korean fried chicken!  This place was busy. It took forever to get my order (about 30 minutes). The service was very unfriendly. Not rude, but so not happy to be there. I don't expect excellent service from a take-out place, but you should at least meet the standards set by the teenagers at your local McDonald's. Geez Louise.   I tried the jerk chicken roti. I should have just went with the jerk chicken meal special ($6.25) and saved myself five bucks. The roti was okay. It was stuffed full of jerk chicken, jerk gravy, and jerk gristle. The chicken had a decent flavour, but I do agree with one previous reviewer that the kitchen does love their clove. A little too much for my taste. The roti was soggy with the jerk gravy so there was no way to pick it up. They don't provide you with a knife so it was awkward trying to dig into it with just a flimsy plastic fork. Request a knife if you're going to be getting roti.  After a few bites, I became bored with the monotonous taste of jerk chicken and roti. There were no vegetables to break up the monotony. I should have went with the special so at least I could have had some rice and coleslaw to go to between bites of jerk.   Not impressed enough with the food to put up with the lack luster service and the incredibly long wait."}
{"text":"My experience of jerk goes as far as a few small joints in Jamaica, and Ritz downtown, but using that experience, I would say that Mtizie's is damn good :).  My husband and I came here on a Friday night and we were in and out within 20 minutes. We ordered the curry chicken and of course the classic jerk chicken. Portion sizes were great, the only thing we'd change for next time is to ask for more oxtail sauce!   Definitely check this place out if you want the great taste of jerk without having to travel all the way downtown. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing and friendly customer service. Tried the jerk chicken with curry goat gravy and it was amazing cant wait till my next vist. Mitzies is definitely some of the best carribbean food I have had."}
{"text":"Not the best Jamaican food I've ever had but the jerk chicken is yummy and the jerk seasoning is not too spicy. The location for me is also really convenient so it's my go-to for a quick and satisfying meal when I'm craving Caribbean."}
{"text":"I've searched high and low for authentic Jamaica roti in every corner of our fair city. Mitzies is by far the #1 source in the city!!! Always fresh and friendly. Mitzies is sweat as can be, my constant praise and affection of this establishment and it's proprietor gets my wife a little jealous but one bite of Mitzies amazing food is worth it.   Love, love, love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I think I might have ordered the wrong thing here, given the comments from other yelpers I would have been better served ordering the Ox Tail, jerk chicken or fried chicken.  I had a recent amazing first experience with Jerk Pork and I was craving it recently but didn't want to trek back to Brampton for it. Noticed Mitzie's was close and had it on the menu so I ordered a large Jerk Pork with rice and peas and a patty sandwich on the side.  Patty sandwich on coco bread was pretty good, but I did think maybe it was missing something, is it usually just patty in a bun? I feel like there are other ingredients, maybe lettuce and tomato? No. Anyway, it was pretty good.  The jerk pork, I was split on, some pieces were kinda dry while others had good gristle on them and lots of flavour. The rice and peas were blah, as in not really good in my opinion - even as a side I expected a bit better.  That said, the price was right, the portions were huge and the seasoning was on point so I can't begrudge them too much. I think maybe I need to go back next week and order jerk chicken and fried chicken (at the same time... because you know... fat guy goals) and re-evaluate!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Mitzie's Jerk is my favourite place for Jerk Chicken in Toronto. I've tried all the big names in the city and a lot of the small, easy-to-miss strip plaza jerk joints.  The flavour quality and intensity is consistent, it's pungent and spicy, the way it should be! I've had jerk as dull as dishwater elsewhere. The rice n' peas too have a lot of flavour which is atypical, I find.  The service is always cordial if not outright friendly.  My only wish of Mitzie's is that they'd switch their creamy slaw to a regular slaw. But that's not enough of an issue to knock 'em down a star.  Their Fry Chicken is also quite good.  Keep it up Mitzie!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place (with about 3 stools) across from the Islington subway station.  I couldn't decide between the jerk chicken or curry goat so the gentleman at the counter said I could get both of them in one dish with rice and peas and coleslaw for a slightly higher price.  The jerk chicken was very good (albeit slightly strong when it came to the amount of allspice in my personal opinion).  But the real draw for me was the curry goat as it was incredibly tender and amazingly well spiced.  It was perhaps the best Jamaican curry goat I've ever tried.  I was a little sad to see the place completely empty on a Saturday night so I hope word spreads about this place."}
{"text":"Best Jerk I've had in the city.  The only one that has a crust like in JA.  Curry goat is excellent as well - boneless but tons of flavor.  Also well trimmed so you don't get piles of fat.  Love it and worth the trip."}
{"text":"I went here since reviews were good. I got the goat curry which was quite good. I've had better though. Service was nothing special. Neither friendly nor impolite. Price was on the high side though 17$ for a large sized goat curry after tax. I would come back for the lunch specials where it's more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I can't settle for less when it comes to my caribbean food. Dry oxtail, jerk chicken was not great, rice OK..."}
{"text":"I eat here weekly. Mitzie and her staff are nice and and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"Stopped in fort lunch with two co workers.  We ordered the mix up plate.  Awesome flavors.  Tiny Patio but nobody on it.  Recommend highly.  The jerk seasoning was superb. Will head back"}
{"text":"Mixed review today.  The service was great and my roti was freshly made (hence the two vs one star review), however it was bland and fell apart the minute I opened up my takeaway container.   I will give it another try soon. Need a roti joint in my 'hood, so fingers crossed."}
{"text":"This place is a stone's throw from my office, and I've had the pleasure of dining here at least 12 times over the last two months.  First, most people go here for the jerk chicken.  The jerk chicken is excellent and well priced, but I've only ever eaten it once.    That's because I discovered Mitzie's Curried Goat Roti.  Though my grandmother set the bar for curried goat roti, Mitzie's does a good job.  The goat is actually cut from the leg, so its boneless - most Jamaican places use the bony body of the goat, and its no fun having to pick bits of bone out of your meal.  The boneless goat is good, there are a couple of other places that stew it better (if they cut it into smaller chunks it would work).    What really pushes their roti over the edge is the Roti bread itself.  It tastes about 99.9% like my grandmothers.  Its the real thin variety of Roti stuffed with the ground chick peas"}
{"text":"Oh my, the jerk chicken roti is to die for. I've been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks because I crave and crave. Gonna have to put in overtime at the gym just to keep up with my addictions."}
{"text":"I tried their food and it was amazing.. I have also tried 3 other jerk restaurants in the last couple of months- and this is BY FAR the best.... Sorry to the others..  They provide the option of white rice/or rice and beans.. (they call them peas).  The jerk chicken that I ate was much much better than the other 3 places we tried.. There was spice to Mitzies jerk chicken-  I found other places had no taste and were bland.. I will for sure be going back!"}
{"text":"You have got to try this !  This the best jerk I had in a long time.  The owners are great too.  I will defiantly get back there !!!"}
{"text":"How good is Mitzie's Jerk?  I ate here at least once a week for over 3 years. And while one could argue that this area is a bit of a dead zone for food, Mitzie's has been a shining beacon of good food since I made my first visit back in 2014.   The Jerk Chicken sandwich is one of the best chicken sandwiches in the city. Pulled jerk chicken stacked on a coco bun with Mitzie's creamy coleslaw smothered on top... It is a meal in itself and rings in at $9.89 after tax, making it my lunchtime favourite.  On the lunch tip they also offer a $7 special which gets you some chicken with rice and peas and a canned pop or bottle of water which is a great deal. But frankly, once you have the sandwich it'll be hard going back to rice and peas.  On the dinner flex, the curry goat is also really good, and for $17 for a large dinner you'll get a giant portion of curried goat on rice and peas and a coleslaw on the side.  If you go with the standard jerk chicken or pork on rice and peas, pay for a side of the oxtail gravy and dump that all over the plate. Next stop, Flavour Town!  I could go on and on but I'll just stop right here and say you should go.  PRO TIP: Call in your order in advance. The place gets busy as it is, and even a call in order may take 20+ minutes to be ready. But I assure you, it's worth every minute of the wait and you'll likely be coming back on the frequent just like I did."}
{"text":"Tried the oxtail tonight. At first I was disappointed with portion size, having spent over $16 on what was supposed to be a large. After viewing and tasting it, I realized that I was spared. The quality of the meat was lacking - dry and stringy, as in it must've been a very old cow. The overuse of browning and sugar was unnecessary and certainly did not lend to improving the flavour, which was very much lacking. The coleslaw, well let's just say that there's more mayo than there is cabbage. So, if you're a Jamaican or just know how West Indian food should taste, then spare your time, your wallet and your taste buds and make the trip to one of the restaurants downtown or even Scarborough.  Suffice it to say, I will never cross Mitzie's threshold again."}
{"text":"Every time I order from Mitzie's, I always end up getting into a food coma. Their jerk chicken roti is heaven and I absolutely recommend getting it for your first visit. The oxtail platter is also a really great option too - I had the small dinner platter with rice and peas and coleslaw on the side and I ended up being super full afterwards. The prices are not bad too considering the generous portions! If you are down for some comfort food with a bit of an edge, definitely come over to Mitizie's!"}
{"text":"Mitzie's makes excellent Curry Goat. I can't speak to the other items on her menu, because I honestly only want more of her Curry Goat! The Rice & Peas are good, along with the coleslaw on the side.   We've eaten there over half a dozen times, our only complaint would be sometimes it's not spicy enough! (That's why they invented Hot Sauce though.)  Service is excellent if Mitzie is behind the counter, can be lacking sometimes if she's busy cooking. They now offer delivery on Saturdays, but it's mostly Pick Up, with a few chairs if you want to eat in.  If you call ahead she'll get your order ready for you: 647-345-0077"}
{"text":"We go to Mitzie's fairly regularly and we are never disappointed - actually we could probably eat Mitzie's everyday! We usually get the Mitzie's Mix-up and it gives you a variety of meats on the menu in one box.  A great chance to taste almost everything on the menu - trust me we get the mix-up because we love it all! Jerk pork and oxtail is our favourite! Mitzie's is a great spot and Mitzie's herself is such a down to earth woman. Thanks Mitzie's!"}
{"text":"Great flavor and generous portions. Also has a small patio for nice weather. The curried goat is spicy and pungent while the stewed chicken is tender and sweet. This place has fast service!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! The service is amazing! Live in Mississauga and I make the trip."}
{"text":"Mitzies is life. I work across the street and am devastated that we'll be moving offices soon, as that means I won't get my Mitzies fix anymore.    The lunch specials are such a great deal, $7 for a container of rice and beans, chicken  (stew, jerk, fried, or bbq) and a drink. I love the fried chicken and the stew is good on a cold day. For sides, the cole slaw is a must, and the plantain too. Keep in mind that there's usually a long line and wait for the food during lunch time.   After hours, I'll get the ox tail when I want something bigger and heartier. Haven't tried the roti but have heard amazing things about it."}
{"text":"Had mitzie's for the first time today. I've been looking for a jerk spot in the west end for the last year and thankfully enough, Mitzie's delivered! I had the jerk chicken lunch special with coleslaw on the side. The jerk chicken was flavourful, the right amount  of spice and fall off the bone. The oxtail gravy took the rice to the next level, so yummy. The only downfall to the meal was the very creamy coleslaw. It was just too creamy and overwhelming. Otherwise, great jerk chicken, and my new jerk spot in the west end!"}
{"text":"By far the best food options around Bloor and Islington. The prices are also amazing - $7 with hst which is also amazing. The service can be a little slow but it's well worth the wait. Great food and great value! Thanks"}
{"text":"3.5 to be exact.  Just finished half of my oxtail on rice and peas.  While tasty, it is still no Portland Jerk (see review).  The meat was pretty tender and the rice and peas were great!  There's just something missing in the flavour.  However, not bad at all.  Also, in comparison to Portland Jerk, they don't give as much oxtail.  It is not packed to the brim.  I called ahead for pick up as I read they get busy.  However, drove there to pick it up on my lunch (2:00 ish) and I was the only one in there.  Service was fast and friendly.  I believe it was Mitzie herself that came out as I was waiting for my transaction to finish.  She smiled and greeted me, asking how I was.  She was so pleasant.    I will return to try the jerk pork, but only if I'm in the area.  It was quite a trek to go on, for a lunch break."}
{"text":"I was having one of those days where I was craving jerk chicken - you know those days, right? Luckily, I was in the area, saw the lineups, checked out the reviews, and thought we'd try it out. Plus, people in the area told us we just had to, had to go here for lunch. Overall, not sure if it's the best jerk chicken I've had, and I have reservations calling it anything more than average.  We arrived around 12:15 PM and it was very, very busy - keep in mind that there are a lot of office buildings in the area so workers flock here at lunchtime for a good, cheap lunch combo. So, beware the lines. We ordered the jerk chicken lunch special with rice which comes with a canned drink. A majority of the chicken was dark meat (which, personal preference, I don't really like). The meat was definitely tender with decent marinade, but it was also quite oily and had a strange aftertaste. I didn't take to the chicken very well, and, coupled with the oiliness, I didn't come out a big fan. The gravy, on the other hand, is quite good, and I ended up eating most of the rice with gravy, and setting aside the meat. Overall, a pretty average meal.  For two people, with tax, our total came to a little less than $12.70. Keep in mind that there is street parking in the area, along Bloor Street, but it is limited."}
{"text":"Came by this place twice and during both visits,  I had to wait nearly half an hour to get my food.  It's a small store located on Bloor Street West just off of Islington Station mainly set for take out orders as they have no chairs or tables inside to dine in.  During my last visit, it took 5 minutes for someone to come out from the kitchen to take my order despite seeing me walk in the door.  When the cashier did come out, he came out wearing a winter parka coat and said \"sup?\"  (which means so yeah, what the f**k do you want?)     I spent the next half hour listening to their hip hop music and the staff giggling in the back while they prepare my take out food. (It was not even the energetic hip hop, but instead the type of new age hip hop droning about one night stands and having multiple lovers without the fear of STDs)  The curry chicken with rice was sort of bland, nothing really spectacular.  You as the customer, can have either the small or large order.  Small is roughly $10 and Large is roughly $13."}
{"text":"I worked across the street from Mitzie's for years and am kicking myself for not trying it sooner. After I got my nails done, I was starving so I popped in after the lunch rush to get a patty on coco bun. Unfortunately, I was told that the patties would take another 10 minutes and I was afraid my parking meter would expire so I just ordered a jerk pork sandwich to go. NOTE TO SELF: homemade patties next visit.  I ended up waiting close to 10 minutes for the sandwich but Mitzie came out herself to give it to me; she had a nice smile and seemed like a really sweet lady.  Oh my goodness, can I just mention that I don't think I've ever eaten jerk pork as good at this one. All the flavours such as clove, allspice, garlic, etc. were very delicately coming through and there was just the right amount of heat. What made it even more delightful was that it was served on a soft, fresh coco bun! I could only eat half as it was huge!  My favourite spot for jerk!"}
{"text":"No more driving downtown to get good jerk, it's right here in Etobicoke!   I've been meaning to try Mitzi's for months now but finally got in my car and made the trip tonight, and am so glad I did. As soon as I got home I opened the styrofoam to try the rice and immediately noticed that nice coconut flavour you want in your rice & peas. It was nice and moist and not dried out like some places put out. Next was the chicken and coleslaw. Both were exactly what I look for in a jerk chicken. Good heat but not mouth numbing, the coleslaw was sweet and creamy to cool the jerk slightly. The large dinner was about $13+tax which is pretty standard but came full of chicken, probably enough for 2 meals.   Overall this is my new favourite jerk chicken spot and I don't have to put up with downtown traffic to go get some which is a huge bonus. Will DEFINITELY be returning for more in the very near future and hope to try some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I tried mitzies jerk a few years back. Cravings for oxtail. This place is awesome for their oxtail and jerk chicken. Their colslaw used to be better. The sauce for the oxtail changed a little its more on the watery side lately. I still like this place for quick fix. The flavours and the way its cooked is like your grandma made it in right from home and its nice, and comforting."}
{"text":"Mitzy's Jerk it's definitely worth the money as the food is phenomenal well seasoned.  I recommend the roti ,ox tail and their jerk chicken . You can tell that they take pride in their food as everything is melting off the bone and seasoned so perfectly.  They also do catering for large events. This is one of Toronto's hotspots for foodies  I found myself not being able to eat the whole portion as they are so generous so I had a meal for The next day:)"}
{"text":"Haven't had Jamaican food in a loooong time,so decided to check out Mitzie's after a meeting in the neighborhood.I tried the following: ackee&salt fish,cole slaw,jerk chicken,and ox tail.I think Mitzie's ackee and salt fish would be the most authentic I've tried,but not something I personally would order in the future because it's not my thing.Jerk chicken is spicey,but not for those who REALLY like heat,just the right flavors.Ox tail,I decided it would be a good idea to dump the container upside down,losing a third of the sauce another poster raved about.It is a well made dish,a little pricey though.Cole slaw,excellent considering I don't even LIKE vegetables,home made,where I would order a large portion for carry out next visit. Last,but not least,customer service,pleasant surprise I received very good service given the multitude of questions I had."}
{"text":"Just delicious.  You're definitely getting service with 'tude here but it's oh-so worth it.  The curry goat and oxtail is definitely the star here. There's also something really special about the coleslaw.  When it comes to the jerk, I've had better but this is still up there.  So worth the stop for pick up (or delivery) when you just don't feel like cooking but feel like a hearty meal."}
{"text":"A regular at this place.  Great food all around.  Lunch specials.  Ox tail is awesome here.  Can't really go wrong with any order.  Only reason it's not 5 stars is during lunch it can get really busy and can be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best fried chicken in Toronto comes in a styrofoam container. That's because the restaurant doesn't have any seats. Mitzie's is a must-try for anyone who wants to have a respected opinion about jerk chicken in the city. The rice and peas isn't anything to write home about, and the coleslaw is pretty good, but their chicken is out of bounds. The jerk is smokey, spicy and flavourful, and the fried chicken is crunchy, tasty and sure to impress. You're not getting a $2 deal, but the portions are generous, and you're definitely getting the extra you pay vs other jerk spots."}
{"text":"Been here more than once and I find the sauces are always super watery. The jerk chicken is a bit over cooked and under season for my liking. On the up side they make good rice (if it's not drowning in sauce )and Plantain."}
{"text":"The service here is very good. Food is delicious too. Hard to find places who not only offer jerk pork but is made well. Jerk chicken and oxtail as well as curry goat all good."}
{"text":"This place is good probably the best jerk you can get in this part of the city, but the prices keep going up, its getting to the point that I wont be coming back"}
{"text":"I went here last week after reading great reviews elsewhere - We ordered curry chicken roti, jerk chicken dinner and oxtail dinner. The food was great - the roti was moist and tender and very flavourful. The Jerk chicken was amazing - nice and spicy (but not too spicy, medium heat) and the oxtail was soooo yummy. Both dinners were served with rice/beans and coleslaw which was very well done. The spice levels are all mild-medium level so if you want heat add their homemade scotch bonnet hotsauce!!  And the service was outstanding, both the woman taking my order and Mitzi herself were as pleasant as could be!!"}
