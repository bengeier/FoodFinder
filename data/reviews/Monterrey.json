{"text":"AWFUL!! Is the nicest way to describe it. I ordered a combo plate, a taco, burrito and enchilada. The meat was not even edible ( I eat everything ).The burrito and enchilada were identical, tortilla meat and red sauce. the taco was this same meat in a tortilla with a little cheese and cabbage. My wife had a similar meal and could not eat it. We are from southern California so we know what Mexican food is. After asking the waitress about the bad food she told us we shouldn't have ordered the combo plates! No apology about the bad food. I just wish that since she agreed the combo plates are bad that she would have not let us order them. We will never go here again and will strongly advise people to not waste their money here."}
{"text":"First time visting this place.  Ordered the burrito with chicken ( had to pay extra 25 cents thought that was different and beef taco.  I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.  The chicken and beef had no seasoning that I could taste at all.  The refried beans was like sauce.  Well the service was fine.  I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite restaurant...The service is terrible. they never get our orders right, and the staff doesn't seem to care... Been eating here for 12 years but never again. Its a shame we will drive right by from now on just to eat Mexican food somewhere else... Been a loyal customer for a long time...."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food with the absurdly large margarita glasses you pretty much expect. Not a rave review but also no complaints"}
{"text":"I love their salsa and chips!!!!  Seems like such a small thing with a mexican restaurant and you would think that it's all the same but it's not.  My whole family agrees this particular location's salsa is always fantastic and we love the thicker style corn chips.  Also the waitress we had last time was very patient with me.  I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to eat and she answered all my questions and even allowed me to customize my burrito which turned out just the way I wanted.  Will definitely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Service is typically great. The food is always prepared fast, and is always delicious!  The daily specials are a plus as well. You can't beat .99 cent domestic drafts (bud light and miller lite) on Thursdays."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his family were at Monterrey's for dinner one night. So he asked me to come join them after work. I was kind of iffy at first because I am not a fan of Mexican cuisine, however, I am so so so glad I did!  The portions are great! I had a lot of rice and beans left over, which are pretty much the only thing I like. They are tasty and moist instead of dried out rice you sometimes might get at other places.   I will definitely come back to give Mexican cuisine another try since I loved their food so much the first time!"}
{"text":"When I was growing up Monterrey was the only Mexican restaurant around, and it's still the only one I ever go to when I'm in Charlotte. It's been a staple for many years and one of two places that I know I'll visit (other than Bojangles) when in NC.  Upon arrival, you are greeted with an overflowing basket of chips, salsa and some other white sort of cheese - sort of ranch dressing/sauce. I usually get enchiladas, but basically everything is good. Most noteable is the cheese that they put on top of everything. I'm not quite sure what's different about it, but I can't seem to find it anywhere else, it's delicious. Lunch plates usually run between $4-$7, so it's super cheap. You pay up front and they've got these little jars of chicklets gum - I used to always beg my Dad to buy me a pack when I was little. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We had to repeatedly ask for certain items to be brought to our table, and the food wasn't anything to get excited about."}
{"text":"I used to come here frequently for the margaritas and the authentic food, until Cinco de Mayo 2016...  The food has honestly always been very mediocre, but that night was a whole new low in terms of preparation, management and service.  Part of our table got their food a full hour after the rest of us.  Twice, our drink orders were taken and completely lost.  At the end, we stood and waited for over an hour for a wildly inept manager to finally decipher and put together an incorrect bill... But I came back...several times.  No change.  Today my guest ordered a shrimp burrito.  He got steak.  1/3 of my order was wrong, 1/3 never, ever came.  Lucio, the bartender, could not POSSIBLY have been more smug and inattentive.  I'll see everyone at El Veracruz or Cabo's because I'll never be here again!"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing as I don't think I will ever get tired of it.  I get the Mole Poblano chicken.  The sauce is so delicious and I order extra of it.  I also love their pico de gallo and other salas as they taste fresh made. The rest of us has ordered various items and all has been really tasty.  While it isn't strictly authentic, it's hundreds times better than most so called Mexican places nearby.  Only reason I gave it a 4 stars as sometimes they play around with their mole and it isn't consistently the same.  But that only happened twice in the years I have been eating here.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very pathetic service. We used to be regular but now started going to Zapata's instead. All of male servers doesn't even understand English and uncourteous. They do not even have any mannerisms and respect for customers. These male servers will screw your orders and will not even show any regrets of their mistakes but instead will crib about it while serving you. Never going back."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible  Their dips were  basic service was no good order a mix fajita with the beef and chicken I can till  the chicken was frozen I do not recommend this place to anyone  I don't see why a lots of people are given 4 and five stars don't recommend it at all rather go eat at chuys much better"}
{"text":"Salsa is mostly water, and the food is medocre at best.  Better options available in the area."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my work, and I've gone three times as part of a group. The first two times, service was slow but not unbearably so. The food was decent, and the spicy mayo dip was really good.  Today was my third visit. Halfway through my taco salad, I felt a clump of hair in my mouth. I fished it out, and although I really wanted to believe it had just fallen off my sleeve or shoulder, the clump looked nothing like my hair (blond) or my companion's (red).  We calmly asked for the manager and explained the situation. He picked up the glob of hair off the napkin and told us that it couldn't be the restaurant's fault because none of the employees have dark-brown hair. (Every single one that I saw did.)  Then he walked away, said something to the server that sounded like \"wants a free meal.\" They brought me a bill for $3 for my drink and brought my companion her full bill.  Gross as it was, I understand that mistakes happen. But when he implied that I was lying -- that pissed me off. If something similar had happened in my restaurant, I would have fallen all over myself trying to make it right, not insulted the customer.  Total lack of class and decency. We will never go again."}
{"text":"It's ok...their food comes on a hot plate that seems to be frozen and then microwaved not made in the oven. We had the combo plates and there was no differentiation between the burrito, chalupa and taco because they all had the same sodium-full red sauce.  Nothing authentic about this place, will definitely not be going back!"}
{"text":"Bland.  Bland salsa.  Bland food.  Food came quickly, waitress did not return to the table until we were done.  I had to get up and find someone to refill my glass.  My wife's chicken nachos had no onions, peppers, or cilantro.  The meat in my burrito and enchilada had a grainy texture.  The taste was not horrible, just bland. I have no reason to return."}
{"text":"I consider Monterrey the standard for really good 'dive' Mexican food.  There is nothing gourmet about it and you can order by number.  The menu comes with pictures and you get a side of refried beans with almost everything.  The waitstaff is friendly and actually speaks Spanish. And the salsa - oooh how I crave the salsa.  Whenever I'm in town, I require a trip here!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised how excellent the food was considering the cheap lunch specials. The waiter was very friendly and the atmosphere was very pleasant and authentic. The only thing missing was a live Mariachi band :-) Didnt get any drinks since it was my lunch break but I hope to come back and try their margaritas one day."}
{"text":"Convenient Mexican restaurant. Okay food and somewhat fast service. The wait staff isn't personable at all, but the manager does remember you if you're a return customer which is nice. Atmosphere is awkward and quiet. Would describe it as a run of the mill Mexican place and there's nothing incredible about it. Also, I've yet to get a correct website or to-go menu for this location which is frustrating."}
{"text":"Good cheap Mexican food. Get the Gringo dip it is my favorite. They have also recently added table side guacamole service. The vegetarian dishes are all cheesy delights and the beer selection is surprising for such a divey place."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fair.  Service was bland with no smiles.  Felt like a transaction the whole time."}
{"text":"So I've been coming here for years. Since like middle school. I normally go to don Pedro in pineville but I told my lady we should try out Monterrey just to mix it up. This guy at front didn't even greet us I had to ask to be sat and after that I waited like ten minutes with no server and my girlfriend and I decided to walk out and they watched us walk out. So that is the last time I'm coming to this place. It has gone down hill"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices.  After your food is delivered thats it from the waitress.  We wanted to order more drinks but no one came over for 15 minutes so we cashed out and left."}
{"text":"The best Mexican place in the Lake Norman area. Everything on the menu and the service is always wonderful. You can't go wrong with a Tecate. Also if you go and whatever you have ask for the Valentina hot sauce. This is not hot but very flavorful with whatever you add it to."}
{"text":"Oh Monterrey...you had me at lime margarita pitchers for $11.99!!! Frozen or on the rocks with sugar or salt on the rim...freaking delicious! Oh my Goodness!!! And thank you for making sure I could taste the liquor!!! Really, really appreciated.   This place was a really great find! But normally the local hole in the walls have the best and most reasonably priced food!   Okay...probably the best thing thing about this place os that they serve white sauce AND salsa with the chips!!! My friends and I were delighted! You see, coming from Virginia we are used to getting salsa and white sauce whenever we have Mexican but since we have been down here everyone thinks the \" white sauce\" we speak of is queso...ummm Nooo!!!   But not here! Every basket of chips we had were hot and the white sauce was spicy and delicious...next time I just need them to leave the container with that sauce on our table. Not even close to joking...it's just that good!   I ordered the Shrimp Chimichangas with cabbage salad and rice. It was scrumptious!!! Nice large shrimp, seasoned well with veggies then deep fried and topped with queso. Heaven! The rice and cabbage salad were very good as well.   Overall, this was a very good meal...easily 4 stars but since they have white sauce...and great customer service they deserve the extra star.   Go...seriously you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better. My pollo con chorizo (chicken breast & sausage) had a couple itsy bitsy pieces of chorizo... umm, you're supposed to get more than that if you're ordering a $11 dish and not off the lunch specials. I didn't get the flour tortillas either without explicitly asking for them.  Food tasted ok and was brought out really quick, hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Consistently good food with quick service! Margaritas are not the best quality bc they are made with a sweet and sour mix. Ask them to add a splash of orange juice to sweeten it. Table side quac is excellent! Prices are reasonable. Always willing to make substitutions."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with coworkers on 1-14-15, extremely slow service. Food was delicious, but within 30 minutes of eating I had regretted every bite. I've been sick for 2 days now and that delicious meal is to blame. I eat Mexican quite regular and know I'm not allergic to anything they have, this is a case of food poisoning people. It's not worth the $10 you'll spend on a meal to miss a day of work. On top of that, the waitress didn't give me the correct change after I paid. Needless to say, I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am somewhere on the fence of A-OK and Yay! I'm a fan.  Maybe it should be a half star of YAY-I'm an OK Fan.  I popped in today around 230p, starving and in a hurry.  I sat down, the only person in the restaurant, I was greeted very pleasantly.  The chips were ok, the salsa was delicious, not dumbed down and they served that devilish mayonaise sauce that isn't all that good, but it's so bad for you, you can't resist it.  I ordered the lunch special #8 for $4.95, I didn't care what it was, I didn't even give a meat preference, very unlike me. My food came out very promptly, I started inhaling it.  It wasn't the best Mexican food, I'm not going to tell you to rush out and try it, but there was something very comforting about the whole meal.  I notice they have daily drink specials. Monday- $2 domestic Tuesday- $2.50 Mexican cerveza Wed- 3.99 Lime Margaritas Thurs- .99 draft Bud Lt & Mich Ultra Friday- 3.99 Mango Margaritas Saturday $11.99 Lime Margaritas Pitchers Sunday- Kids under 12 eat free"}
{"text":"Visiting and found this gem w/Yelp help.  Great food, super service, and I'll make a point of getting back there."}
{"text":"I will definitely not be coming back here! Service was extremely grumpy. (Tip to restaurant management: PLEASE help your wait staff understand that most patrons expect FRIENDLY service. We are paying after all.) The food was average, at best. And our food came out on old, CHIPPED plates. Absolutely no excuse for that! And to make it a trifecta of negatives: the guacamole was mushy and slimey. There are far better Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Frankly I don't know how this one stays in business."}
{"text":"Love love love me some Monterrey.  Great prices, great service, and great atmosphere.  I enjoy coming here for a quick mexican fix for lunch or dinner.  They are very consistent with their food (which I swear has crack in it....it's so good and keeps people coming back)  Drinks are on the pricey side...thats the only pitfall here.  Otherwise, whenever I leave Monterrey I'm a happy camper and it is always on my \"go to option\" list for meals.  Also, food combinations..... good prices and huge portions! love it."}
{"text":"I was craving Mexican this evening, so the husband and I turned to Yelp to find a place near by.  Yelp delivered Monterrey- just what I was looking for.  I love Cantina, but we had the little one with us and didn't feel like waiting in a long line on a Friday night with a baby.  Monterrey got us right in and served us fresh guac from a cart before we even had a chance to look at the menu- it was delicious!  This is not an upscale dining atmosphere, but it is that same kind of Mexican restaurant you have been to 100 times. think combos and cheap beers.  The food was great, service was good/  We will for sure be  back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have to eat somewhere to remember why you don't eat there anymore. Food was not good. Salsa was awful. Rice tasted \"wierd\" had a smoked flavor. The color of rice was off too.  The beef taquitas were just okay . Nothing spectacular to say about any of the meal. Only that's why we remember we don't eat here .    Coupons are no good if you drink water ...  save your money and go to the Mexican restaurant down in Pineville called  El Vera Cruz  - they don't disappoint!  Lesson learned! El Vera Cruz is the place to go for real authentic Mexican food that actually tastes good. Waitstaff are very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch with my mom. Service was good. Chips were ok and overall food was ok. But seriously a Mexican food place that doesn't serve rice and beans with its dishes? I live in California and have visited many places in Mexico and rice and beans is a standard! Not an extra option unless ordering Nachos. Making me order a side of rice and beans is just ludicrous. My flautas aka taquitos were not crispy as they should be and they came with a \"salad\" which was basically shredded lettuce with the guacamole and sour cream and pico that goes with the flautas.  But I guess that's what this California Girl gets for trying to eat Mexican food in Charlotte. I will stick with the fab bbq!"}
{"text":"I was a late add-on to my party tonight as I got an invite to dinner after the rest of the party already sat down. When I arrived, I sat about 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. I was not offered a menu, or asked if I wanted a drink, and it was not acknowledged that a 3rd person was now sitting at our table. After those 10 minutes passed, one of the other girls got up and retrieved a menu from the un-manned hostess stand, and brought it back to me. It was at this moment that a server asked me if I wanted a drink menu. He handed it to me, and left me to pore over it for about 5 more minutes. I finally stopped him to ask him for a glass of water and a sex on the beach. The water came out, and he began to scurry away. At this point, the other two members of my party were receiving their plates, and while he was setting their food down I asked if I could order. I ordered a taco salad. The food came out only about 3 minutes after my drink, which I ordered long before. The service was slow, the plates were dirty, and silverware/straws needed to be requested before you received them. I was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment. The beef was bland, the pico had an awkward taste to it that I couldn't pinpoint, and it was nothing that would make me come back a second time. I guess it's time to try another Mexican place in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Great Mexican Restaurant chain.  Most of their restaurants are family owned. They have fast service and great food.  I am in the Charlotte area from time to time and often eat here.  This one is no different than the others as far as service and food go, its great.   There is a fan site dedicated to this restaurant chain that has a lot of info about the restaurant and their locations.  Check them out, http://eatmonterreys.com"}
{"text":"Like so many other Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, nothing about this one stands out more than the rest. The usual margarita special that contains what tastes like pure sour mix. The menu of all things that look the same that leaves me not able to decide what the heck I want. I usually end up getting something I didn't really want in the end but scarfed it down 'cause let's face it; it all tastes about the same anyway. The staff seemed to be attentive but didn't really care to be there. I would come back if in the area and craved Mexican food. And that's why I came here this past time."}
{"text":"Candyce B was right again - Monterrey was awesome!  Tucked away in a strip shopping center off of Park Rd (near Black Lion, behind Wendy's), this is the typical small Mexican restaurant that delivers good, cheap eats.  I think this Monterrey has been around for a LONG time (since I was in high school and that was back when Hwy 51 was only 2 lanes...).  I was immediately seated when I walked in, but it took a while for my waiter to get to me.  Though once he did, he was attentive and expedient.  As soon as I was seated, a basket of warm, tasty chips; a small saucer of their salsa, which was a deep red, maybe roasted ingredients?, and not loaded down with cilantro, so I was in love; and a little bowl of heaven, which has been described in the other reviews as white dip, which tasted a little like a thin sour cream with taco seasoning in it - YUM!  It was all I could do to not fill myself up on these 3 delicious starters.  My order: Queso with jalapeno dip ($5) - I have to order queso whenever I go to a Mexican resturant - it's an addiction.  A delicious, dairy addiction.  Served in a large dish, it was very good - perfect thickness without being too thick.  The warm chips held up well. Beef burrito + beef taco + rice lunch special (less than $6) - the taco was in a shell that held up to my crunching, filled with mostly beef, with a sprinkling of lettuce and a healthy dose of shredded white cheese on top.  The beef burrito was a medium size, filled with the same beef as the taco, covered with red sauce and a sprinkling of cheese.  Served with spanish rice that was on the better side of the rice that I have been served at Mexican restaurants - quite good. They serve Pepsi products, so I had a Mountain Dew, which for some reason was the most delicious Mountain Dew I have ever had.    The dip, lunch entree and drink were right around $13 - I was completely stuffed, but not miserable.  I will DEFINITELY be returning, delicious!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, cheesy goodness! This place has the best around. I could eat the cheese dip with a spoon. Service is always great, food comes out super fast and it's very affordable. I have been coming here for years and every dish I have tried has been awesome. If you're a huge fan of cheese like I am then I recommend ordering a vegetarian dish. Instead of meat on the items they replace it with a ton of cheese. =) They also have drink specials almost every day and of course you get unlimited chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service, large portions and the biggest beer I've ever seen!  Despite the review down below, I find their salsa to be very tasty, so much so that my buddy's girlfriend buys it by the caraffe!  Great place to go for lunch when you are pressed for time. Gets a bit crowded, but not to the point where you have to wait for a table.  The chicken quesadillas here are very good.  In the evenings, the small bar area at the back left of the restaurant is a lively little place to grab a beer or margaritaville and watch some futbol on the television.  Monterrey's doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to mexican restaurants, but it does what it does very well, and has become one of my favorites in the area."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my wife. Lunch fajitas were big portion, chilaquiles with chicken and red sauce were good but spicy! Lunch service was fast"}
{"text":"Three of our five meals, the beef wasn't cook completely. We asked the manger to come over and look. He said the red came from the juices the cooked meat sits in. The food didn't taste right. We will not return. Sorry that no one cares here anymore"}
{"text":"Hey, you can't go wrong with Mexican food! This was probably middle of the pack Mexican for me. Nothing crazy good, but still Mexican. lol  We killed the salsa super quick and they were pretty slow to get us a refill, even after we had asked. Service in general was a bit slower than Mexican restaurants I am accustomed to. It wasn't all that crowded either.   I ordered the lunch chimichanga with beef. It was delicious, but wasn't super warm. Its like they sat there for a while as they were preparing the other people at my table's fajitas."}
{"text":"I have been going to Monterrey for over 10 years and it is hands down one of the best mexican places ever! the best staff the best food, and the price is unreal!!"}
{"text":"After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive \"comfort food\"."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place after I freaked out on my husband when a tornado warning came over the radio. This restaurant is everything you expect from a legit, delicious, and cheap Mexican joint. I got a 4 dollar frozen margarita and hubby got a beer. The chips come with salsa and a delicious mysterious spicy/creamy sauce. I ordered the chicken con queso and it was a cheesy dream. My husband was all over my food and everything was so good. The service was fast and I had a great dinner here, I will be back very soon. Our meal and drinks were under 30 bucks. Come here if you want a tasty, fast, no frills Mexican dish."}
{"text":"While living in California I gained a newfound appreciation for Mexican food.  With many excellent taquerias and authentic establishments to choose from, I overcame my prejudice of Mexican food as bland combinations of rice, beans and tomatoes.  When done correctly, it's pretty damned delicious.  Now that we've moved to Charlotte, I figured that finding a decent carnitas taco or pollo con chorizo would be a challenge.  Would you believe that we lucked out on the first try?  Monterrey was just that good.  As the other reviews have mentioned, like any good Mexican restaurant you are first served with a heaping pile of tortilla chips, salsa and the infamous white cheese dip.  Order a beer (Bohemia is always the best) and a main dish, and you'll be off and eating within 5 minutes.  Service was excellent, and the food was totally on point.  My carne asada was grilled to perfection, topped with a grilled jalepeño and served with great rice and refried beans.  The guacamole salad had a little bit of spicy kick to it, yet the sour cream helped tone down the spice of the dish.  Is this place authentic?  I have no idea, probably not.  Is it a hike from uptown?  Yeah.  The best ethnic food is almost never downtown.  Long story short, we will be going back to Monterrey Mexican.  Often, I hope."}
{"text":"YUM. Just moved from California and have tried several Mexican restaurants with no luck. All were bland and pretty much kind of gross. We tried out two combos at Monterrey to sample a lot of the dishes and the food was fantastic.  The beef tacos were delicious and the fish tacos were not too shabby either. The service was fast and even without the coupon, the price was pretty reasonable. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I waited until after eating to post this review.  We were seated immediately because there was no one in the restaurant. We are brought to a dirty table. We sat and waited. And waited. And waited until magically! a sever appears takes our order for a pitcher of top shelf margaritas. Which we then watched him pour from a fountain of premixed drinks. . After we are served our drinks, we wait and wait again, for him to come back to take our order for queso. Which comes rapidly, but is not you typical smooth rich cheese dip. More like chunky and solid.  But before he runs away we managed to ask for a glass of water, in which he fills a plastic cup in a hand washing sink right in front of us. Now he's dying to take our order and rush us out. We order tacos. One word. Bland. 65$ for terrible Mexican. Too many other places in Charlotte for Mexican then to waste your money here"}
{"text":"Not impressed, I ordered a taco salad and it was soggy and watery. I have no idea why, I was so grossed out I didn't eat it. I also ordered a Pineapple Express the first one was awesome full of patron and other alcoholic goodies, the next one was only pineapple juice no liquor. Yep, they tried to get me. The waitresses attitude was very unfriendly she had that \"my period just started and I don't feel like working \" vibe going. The only time she was nice to us is when she got her tip. I can't recommend nor will I go back."}
{"text":"I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean, great service and the food was very good. One of the best quesadillas I've had. And the Dos Equis draft wasn't bad either!"}
{"text":"Burritos deluxe. Nicely done. The interesting thing is that the salsa and the other dipping sauce the give you with your chips. The salsa looks horrible but is actually really good and spicy. The other dip was good, it was just a mystery dip to cool your pallet after the surprising ugly dip kicked you with some heat. Nice job all around, but we do eat with our eyes."}
{"text":"Monterrey is definitely one of the best Mexican food restaurants in Charlotte. I moved here from Texas where you find Mexican food restaurants on every corner and have tried several around the city, but none compare to the food and service at Monterrey. Always the freshest of chips, they hand make the guacamole when you order it and all for their dishes are served fresh and taste great."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for four years. Normally it's quick great service and decent food. Lunch specials are always a great deal ."}
{"text":"Probably one of the oldest mexican places in Cornelius. The ground beef is really tasty, so you can't go wrong, no matter what you order. They have really great service any time of day."}
{"text":"So, tonight I forgot to plan my night out and after two attempts to visit other restaurants, and unwilling to wait for 45 minutes, I somehow convinced my wife that this was the place for us.  One would think that would not be so difficult, but after our last experience, you can see why she was hesitant.....thank goodness I was driving, or I may just have starved.  Now for the night's meal....it was so much better than our last experience so I deemed it an extra star......it is still lacking the consistency, but this time, our server was spot on!   My wife almost placed a bet with me that the meal, and service would be a repeat of our last visit.  I should have taken the bet. We requested the mild salsa and we actually received it. We requested sweet and water and also received them in a timely manner.  ( It is Sad that a highlight of the meal was that you actually received your drinks correctly).  The meals were very prompt, very tasty, and the server was very attentive even though we were located in the back of the restaurant due to the crowd. She even refilled our drinks, prior to them getting half empty.  This was a redeeming visit for this location and as usual, I will continue to follow up on our visits.  I have given three stars, as I mentioned earlier, it just isn't consistent enough to receive 4 stars.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Go to Don Pedro or El Veracruz instead. This place used to be decent cheap Mexican but it has gone DOWNHILL. It's not even mediocre anymore AND they have raised the prices and cheaped out on ingredients! BEWARE: Menu descriptions don't match what you get! Chiles Relienos: chile peppers stuffed with cheese & meat. Not at ALL like that. It's a little 1 inch shred of limp pepper at the bottom of a mush pile of liquid bean and beef bit mix then smothered with cheese. It's a pile of glop (to put it nicely). We got that AFTER my hubs told the surly waiter that he didn't want any beans with his combo.   Fajitas are WAY overpriced. No gaucamole, no sour cream, no lettuce, no beans, no cheese, no salsa or sauce, no sizzle. Just overcooked mush onions and peppers with frozen, flavorless, dry shrimp atop, bland rice and a big pile of dry cabbage and cilantro bits which used to be Monterrey's garnish \"salad.\"    Manager passed by and saw our salsa was empty and did nothing. We never got offered more beer even though our glasses were dry for 1/2 of our meal. All the food that used to come with the meal now costs $2-3 per 1/4 cup as \"extras.\" Waiters are angry, surly old guys. It's dark inside, quiet, no music, no sound from TVs. They won't take your coupon if you happen to order a beer that's on special that night. WiFi is locked for staff use only!? There is NO reason to go here anymore. It's just sad."}
{"text":"Just like a real trip to Mexico, complete with the diarrhea and vomiting. I write this after being woken up at 3 AM this morning to my daughter vomiting. My wife and I also don't feel great after eating here yesterday.  Food was pretty unexceptional going in and even worse coming out."}
{"text":"Service is always good. Salsa and ranch is so good. I don't like how they give small portions of it. Salsa is a very small portion and me and my husband had to ask for more salsa 3x. Burritos are so good!! Rice is fluffy and flavorful. Fajitas are good but there was a time where my fajitas didn't sizzle to the table. Other than that, it's good!!"}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary date night and could not have been more disappointed. Ordered fajitas for 2 and instead of getting sizzling strips of chicken, steak, chorizo, etc. we got flavorless chunks of mystery meat that were indistinguishable from each other. You can get better fajitas at a Chili's and pay less. The service was below par and we always had to chase down the waitress. This place has really declined as it used to be our favorite Mexican place and is now, well, just a place."}
{"text":"Delicious fish tacos with a creamy zesty sauce. Excellent dessert selections. The tortillas are always fresh. Chips are served with pico salsa and an additional creamy salsa. Ample portions, most served with fluffy Mexican rice sides."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating in, we have only done take out once. I was highly disappointed in our experience today. The service staff is like a pack of zombies, there is no personality, no helpfulness.  They were more interested in the little kid that was with an employee. I ordered \"grilled chicken fajitas\". I have had fajitas from many different Mexican restaurants in several states, and they are always sizzling on the iron skillet, and very hot. Until today. This was regular chicken that was very bland, and was not grilled. The onions and green peppers were what I call frozen then cooked. Seemed like my dinner was cooked earlier and then just warmed up.  The rice that was served was almost cold. There was no flavor. For 3 people we paid $42 for a disgusting meal. We won't be back. There are other amazing places in town that do not cut corners, use cheap or frozen ingredients, and serve it hot. Getting food cold like this is a risk for food poisoning. Terrible place to go."}
{"text":"If I wasn't on the clock I would jump on the 99cent draft special."}
{"text":"UPDATE: we have switched our go to mexican food place because the service has been very poor lately....so poor that it is under new management, likely too late to get us back  My wife and I recently moved here from CA and Monterrey's food is definitely comparable to the best mexican food we've had in So Cal and Nor Cal.  The chips and salsa are fresh and we eat at least one full plate each visit. I highly recommend the Arroz con Pollo, Chile Verde, and the fish tacos. The service is great and the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Since moving to South Charlotte my wife & I have struggled finding a Mexican Restaurant with great food at a reasonable price. The struggle is over. Monterrey delivered great food, great service at a reasonable price. We are just mad it took almost a year of bad experiences before we found it. To top it off... I Love the Salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Holy molé...The service was bad, bad. We waited OVER an hour and a half from the time we go to the restaurant until we got served our food.  The wait staff was meh and we had to flag them down for water or chips or salsa refills, order, extra.  The manager was eve wandering around and did nothing to speed up the process- or even notice!  The food it's self is nothing special or exceptional. The only \"special thing they have is a bowl of seasoned mayo along with your chips.. Would not come here again."}
{"text":"The Manager/owner of this restaurant has been there for years, and I might say his attitude and demeanor has not changed a bit since the first visit.  He treats his guests as if they are an imposition in his day.  He is consistently rude and unprofessional.  If you are a regular customer for years he seats you at the worst table in the building, (even with an empty dining room) and then gives you more attitude when you ask for another table.  You may be serving food, but you are selling service as well.  The food is just okay......nothing to get excited about. The quality of the food is inconsistent and dont be surprised if he charges extra for asking for an extra napkin.  Service and a smile are free-neither of these are on the menu.  I would suggest trying all of the other mexican rstaurants in the area.  You may find they treat you like a guest and imposition?  The moral of this story is \"who is paying who?  The guacamole is out of a can, and the chips and salsa too.  Think twice before you go here unless you like doing business with an establishment that does not value its repeat-long-time customers. Hope they can make it with a \"one and done\" customer."}
{"text":"First time here.  Good customer service.  Food was slot better than expected. Better than many more Mexican restaurants I have visited in CLT."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Monterrey on a Saturday.  The place wasn't too busy and I was seated right away.  The salsa and chips appeared quickly.  They also had a second dip, which was ranch, mayo and seasonings.  It was different and good.  I ordered the mole poblano which came with beans and rice.  My food came out in a reasonable amount of time and there was a lot of it.  The chicken grilled and was very tender with a nice smokey flavor.  The rice and beans were pretty standard.  I haven't had mole much, but this was pretty good.  It complimented the grilled chicken well.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend Monterrey to others and will be back myself."}
{"text":"Generic, prefabricated and typical... That's what you will experience when you visit El Monterrey. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but Jesus, we need another Mexican-themed restaurant in Charlotte as much as we need a minor league baseball team downtown!  When you walk in you will feel a sense of deja vu. You've seen this place a million times in hundreds of cities around the nation. The same shitty decor, the same shitty Budweiser and Corona ads plastered tackily all over the wall. The mass-produced, made-in-china imitation \"papel picado\" and the cheap dining tables and chairs. You have definitely been here before. Sometimes I wonder if the same guy bought all the restaurants in the US and recycled the theme and look and simply changed the  name to keep up a false sense of diversity.  Went with Mother Dearest for lunch today and had a very unremarkable experience. Service was good and fast, food was very nice and tasted as decent as any other of these types of restaurants.  The only thing worth mentioning, and it's not really a good thing, is that with your chips and salsa they also give you a little dish of a white dip. I couldn't place it exactly but it kinda tasted like ranch and bacon. It was very artificial tasting too... maybe from a powder and cream cheese? Who knows? It wasn't horrible, but it just did't mesh well with the other stuff.  Also, for what it is, generic Mexican-themed food, it's kinda pricey. You really won't find a decent dish for under $8 on the menu after 3pm. Just thought I'd throw it out there.  All in all, going here is like going to McDonald's for a burger. You go because you're close by and it's there."}
{"text":"Awful service - Go to Zapata's around the corner.    Full large Margarita spilt on my lap tonight.  When I complained that it wasn't taken off the bill (at least...enough years waiting tables myself to know that's worth a free meal) the manager said it was because they were short staffed (...I'm not seeing the connection?!?).  This wasn't the only incident tonight, just poor service that didn't want to be there or help us.  Even though we've been there a dozen times (for the food), we will now drive past it to hit Zapata's."}
{"text":"After a recent visit, I have to say Monterrey definitely did not live up to what I remember. I stopped in for lunch and found the service and food were both just ok. Service, very slow. After being seated I waited almost 20 minutes before receiving chips and salsa and water. As for the food, the chips and salsa are still good. Chips were fresh, hot and seasoned perfectly with salt. I ordered a combo meal: beef taco, chicken burrito and chicken quesadilla. The beef taco was cold and the meat was very bland, didn't bother finishing that one. The quesadilla and burrito had the same shredded chicken, which I still love. However the quesadilla was lacking the cheese and wasn't that hot, almost like it sat for a while. The burrito was by far my favorite, lots of chicken and cheese covered in a tasty red sauce.  I think another Monterrey location is better and may stick with that one when I have my Mexican cravings."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever eaten at. Their food is delightful as well as the atmosphere. I've ordered so many different things from this restaurant between takeout for lunch and going after work and sitting down to eat a dinner that I can't recall everything I've ever eaten there. What I do recall the most is that I obviously love the food because I've been there so many times I can't even count.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly the service is great and they make a pretty mean margarita!!!"}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying out a good Mexican place in town. When I saw the Groupon a few days ago for Monterrey I picked it up and we went there tonight to use it.  The restaurant is tucked away in the back of the Magnolia Plaza. It has quite a few seats in it, and when we went in at 6pm there were only two other tables there. There was a friendly hostess waiting as we entered, a guy brought over chips and two salsas (one mild and very tomato-y and the other having some spiciness) the moment we were sat down, and the waitress came over within a minute to greet us and take our drinks down. The drinks are one of the reasons this place gets 5 stars in my book. I had a 16oz glass of XX on tap, and it was only $2.85! My wife had the house margarita which was 12oz and that cost only $1.99. These are their everyday prices! Not happy hour, not the Monday special, but every freaking day of the week!!!  The menu is what I like to see in a Mexican restaurant...a variety of special entrees as well as the \"combination\" page where you can mix and match the Mexican basics like tacos, burritos and enchiladas. Now when I go to a Mexican restaurant, I base my opinion of them on their carnitas. I have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for these succulent morsels of porky goodness, and if a place can get it done right then I'm sold and will gladly return. So I ordered the carnitas ($11.35) and I'm happy to say that it was spot on. The pork was extremely tender and oh-so flavorful. There's nothing fancy about this meat...little to no seasoning (maybe salt) and no sauce, so it's all about the quality of the meat and how it's cooked, and this was cooked perfectly. It was served with lettuce, pico, avocado wedges, refried beans, rice, half a lime and three flour tortillas. Everything went well together, and this was some of the best rice I've ever had...not crunchy or dry, but very moist. I took home extra rice and beans and will definitely be making a tasty omelet tomorrow morning with it!  My wife initially ordered the number 7 combo, which was an enchilada and chili relleno. When asked which meat she wanted, she ordered the chicken since she does not eat beef. This is where we encountered the only \"issue\" with the restaurant. Her chili relleno was not what we expected. In every other Mexican restaurant we've eaten in, from New York to Florida to Nevada, a chili relleno has always been the meat stuffed inside a full or half pepper. This was not what she got. Monterrey's version of a chili relleno is basically a ground beef ball smothered in cheese sitting atop one strip of green pepper. It wasn't so much the fact that the dish was prepared differently than usual, but that it was beef instead of chicken. We called the waitress over and I don't  think she initially understood what our problem was. Eventually my wife explained it enough times for her to understand, and the waitress suggested that my wife get a chicken taco and then she would just change the order to the enchilada/ taco combination. Her taco came out fairly quickly afterwards and it was good. Nothing fancy, but tasty. Her enchilada was likeways very tasty and cooked as you would expect a chicken enchilada to taste.  The total for the two of us came out to $26 and change, and after giving her the $20 Groupon we were left to pay $6 and change, plus tip. The food and drinks are cheap compared to other Mexican restaurants I've been to, the service was quick and friendly, and the one problem we had was resolved in the end, though it took some explaining for the waitress to understand what the issue was. The price, quantity, and quality of food and service are both flippin' sweet and I would highly recommend going here to get your Mexican on. We'll definitely be checking out other Mexican restaurants nearby, but I'll totally be coming back here again someday soon."}
{"text":"I used to go here many years ago and was pleased.  The place was not packed, maybe half full on a Friday night.  It took us a while to be noticed at our table.  The service up until we got our meals was slow or maybe it was just inattentive.  We got the customary chips and salsa.  One of the salsas was creamy.  Both were very hot, too hot really and I enjoy hot foods.  Because I was unsure if I would get water again I slowed down.  I got a dish that was a breaded steak which was very good.  That dish was good but I would not go back because of the service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. It reminds me of some places I used to eat back home and has a great all-around menu. Everything I have tried has been great, from fajitas to quesadillas, to the combo plates. Service is always good, too. Their salsa is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I've had a love/hate relationship with Monterrey for years.  This local chain and its other area locations used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  I think the best location of the chain is in the University area but this one has its moments and has improved again in recent years.  The salsa here is one of my favorites for a mexican place. It's spicy and flavorful and it adds a nice flavor to the otherwise bland rice that comes with many of the meals.    For the meal, 90% of the time I order the same thing, the pollo fundido which is chicken wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried and then topped with cheese and sour cream.  But lately it hasn't been as good as usual and I've come away dissapointed.  A few years ago I stopped coming here because they actually sent out Taquitos instead of the regular dish and I was quite disappointed with this change but they seem to be back to normal now.  One thing is consistent, the service.  It's usually excellent here.  You are rarely waiting for anything and this is one of the reasons I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Called to place a take-out order.  Was told to \"wait one minute\", which led to 15+ minutes.  I drove to the restaurant, still on hold, walked in and saw the phone sitting on the counter.  Told them I was still on hold with them and they picked up the phone and ended the call.  Didn't seem to care...waste of time."}
{"text":"Always have a good experience here. The good is great and the service is also nice. Pro tip..try the chilaquiles."}
