{"text":"We've been going there for years and the food is always good. The service is excellent but I don't necessarily consider it \"welcoming\" or \"friendly\" service per se. The servers get the job done in that they take the order, bring you the food, and refill soft drinks or ask if you'd like another alcoholic beverage."}
{"text":"I used to live out in Southern CA and in NV and got very used to eating great mexican food! In Ohio it has been hard to find really good mexican food...until recently! If you love mexican food, you must try Cozumel's mexican restaurant!!! They also have a location in Brunswick, OH."}
{"text":"Probably the best tex-mex in the area.  They have the classics and will custom make dishes for you."}
{"text":"First off, allow me to say I just moved back to Ohio from El Paso, Texas.

My family rants and raves about this place. Today I went for my first time. Wait staff is very eager, speak very fast, seem impatient. I ordered a golden Margarita and it was decent, can't complain about cheap booze.
For my meal, I ordered the chimigangas. Typically, a deep fried burrito of sorts. I was greeted with a soggy, tortilla, and a pile of unseasoned ground beef. The beans, are very good. Not sure what they are exactly, because they look and taste much different then normal refried beans. This is another example of crappy \"Mexican\" food. Lacks flavor, not very inexpensive, and small portions. It's a shame. My quest for proper Mexican food will go on!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently average and about as good as Mexican cuisine will get in Northern Ohio. Having been west, I set the bar lower for Mexican food out here. 

The fresh salsa is great but the entrees are just ok. I do not find the food here to be remarkable but it is perfect for a change of pace in an area where bar menus are prevalent in most other restaurants. I feel like many of the menu options taste the same despite being listed as different items. I consistently order the different burritos and am always satisfied with both taste and portion size. 

The service here is usually consistent and if you are here during the dinner hour it will be slammed so expect adequate but not overly attentive service. 

The atmosphere is family friendly so do not expect a quiet meal. There is not much of a bar either so plan on table service only."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Cozumel in Broadview Heights Ohio since it opened. The food is hot, fresh, fast, and inexpensive. Add to this the best guacamole and margaritas around and you'll leave very happy!"}
{"text":"This should be everyone's GO-TO restaurant in Broadview Heights!! Always quick service, HUGE portions, HOT food, and a very reasonable price!! Keep up the good work Cozumel!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in cleveland!   Get the Queso sauce with chips and the chicken fajitas.  The salsa is so good you could drink it plain!  Good prices too, especially the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the service is not worth it. I thought it might be a one time thing, but every time I go no matter what server we have the service sucks!"}
{"text":"This has become our \"go to\" Mexican place. Service is always friendly and fast. Nice portions and food is good."}
{"text":"Cozumel is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at in NE Ohio, and believe me, it's hard to find good Mexican food in this area. This location is at 82 and Broadview in a nice strip mall. There are also locations in Brunswick, Brook Park, and Independence. The restaurant is a decent sized and there was a decent sized crowd when we went on a Sunday night. We were seated right away and given a bowl of chips and salsa. The chips are excellent here, as is the spicy salsa. It's not \"OMG, WATER, WATER!\" spicy, but it's not mild either. The chips are some of the best I've ever eaten in a restaurant. The food didn't take long to come out after we ordered, I think about 10 minutes or so. I ordered the deluxe burritos. There was one beef and one chicken burrito and they were covered with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. They were excellent. Each burrito was full of flavor and tasted great. Another nice thing about this restaurant is the spirit of the waiters. While we were eating, we heard a whistle go off and then sudden singing. They were singing \"Happy Birthday\" to someone celebrating their birthday. It was a surprise, but it shows the attitude of the wait staff here. Overall, if you're looking for a really good Mexican restaurant in Cleveland, head to Cozumel and enjoy one of the few good Mexican restaurants in Greater Cleveland."}
{"text":"i only gave this two stars because the food was good


SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE 

I had to call the waiter over to refill our drinks after we waited 20 minutes

he then brought my food out and not the other people at my table they had to wait another 10 minutes, not normal restaurant manner 

i dont  know if the waiter was new or if he didnt think we would tip him because we are younger wither way horrible service i was not happy and wont go back"}
{"text":"If you grew up in the area, you know Cozumel because it's the best place to be for cheap food and delicious margaritas.  The salsa is heavenly and very-cilantro'ed, and the meals come out incredibly fast.  It's not gourmet or fancy, but they will put a big hat on you and sing for your birthday.  It makes me happy just thinking about it.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and it came really quick.  I know that i can count on Cozumel for a delicious meal that doesn't take long to bring out."}
{"text":"Its a breath of fresh air from those Chi-Chi's and Don Pablo's chains.  The food is Mexican and its great.  The waiters are all friendly and on top of everything.  The service is also very fast.  I have waited longer at McDonald's sometimes than I wait here.  The waiters also bring it our all on one arm, no tray,  which is pretty amazing.  If you are looking for something more authentic, cheap, and fast try Cozumel out."}
{"text":"We love this place! Consistently good food and margaritas! We have become regulars and are never disappointed. This business is pretty much the only one that has survived in that little plaza. But even though the places around it are coming and going, Cozumel is still there and always busy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews my wife and I decided to try this place out. To say the least we were very unimpressed! The service was horrible and the was just edible! I had the burrito deluxe and it had almost no flavor. The wife had a chicken dish cooked in sour cream and she said that it was very bland. After our food came to the table the server never returned to refill our drinks and I had go find him to get our check. The only saving grace about this place is the salsa and chips. The salsa was very spicy and fresh. We would not recommend this place to anyone and will not return!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Brecksville we would come here weekly. I miss living so close to here! The prices are very inexpensive and the food is always great. We always order the queso dip (it's a must with the chips and salsa) accompanied by numerous tacos and chicken quesadillas! The staff is great and friendly on every occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  I have yet to find good mexican food in Cleveland.  If this place was in another city it might just be average but since I have been in Cleveland for 3 years and had such a lack of mexican food in that time it was amazing.  Also very clean and large servings."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local Mexican restaurant! Great food and prices! They have a good kids menu, too for picky little eaters. Chicken and shredded beef chimichangas are yum!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Cozumel by a local legend named Bobby about 5 years ago. Having played soccer with half of the staff, I can honestly say these are genuinely good people that provide great service. The food always comes out fast and hot, ready to be enjoyed. 

2 words: CANCUN CHEESESTEAK. It has never failed."}
{"text":"Went to Cozumel's for the first time and it was excellent.  The service was fast as the waitress had to come back because we weren't ready to order because we were b.s ing.   The salsa was excellent and fresh and I tried the fajita sampler and all were excellent, beef, chicken, and pork.  The value was great too.   We went on a Tuesday and the place was almost full, yet the restaurant flowed well.   Large portions, good atmosphere, excellent value. As for the haters who think they are the only people who know Mexican food, I have eaten at hundreds of restaurants, visited Mexico, and the food was what you would expect from a casual authentic Mexican dining experience."}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the enchiladas Verdes. Absolutely delicious!The portion was huge I had a hard time finishing it. Chips and salsa were ok typical of what I'd had at most places. My boyfriend had the Vallarta special also very good and super gigantic. Service was great and super fast. Will definitely stop again if I'm out this way"}
{"text":"I personally like their lunch specials.  Hit them up a lot for take out for lunch.  Food is always hot and you get a pretty big portion.  The atmosphere is great and everyone inside is always friendly.  If your in the Broadview Heights area give them a try......"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly environment, and great service.  I had the Enchilada Verdes based on a prior review and it was delicious.  Definitely a restaurant worth visiting."}
{"text":"This place is always packed when I drive by on my way to and from work- why I don't know.  I feel like no matter what I order, the dishes all look and taste the same.  Everything on the plate always looks and tastes mushy with no flavor.  How can Mexican food have no taste?  Well here it does- maybe the cooks don't taste what they're preparing, because everything lacks flavor.  If you want better, try El Rodeo, or if you're looking for some Mod-Mex with good flavor and good heat, get out to El Carnicero in Lakewood....You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall very tasty and attentive service. I have come here many times with my girl friend's parents after mass. It gets very busy after the 4pm mass time frame (so 530-6pm-ish ) which should be expected. The service is pretty good and prices are slightly cheaper than other locations nearby. Queso is about $3 if you want with the chips and I got Chicken nachos that the first time I had them were very cream almost like queso cheese that was white but then I ordered again and it is just shredded cheese. bummer. I typically get the burrito which is great but nothing you cannot get anywhere else. the positive is that it is slightly cheaper than elsewhere but considerable size and all. Worth a nice trip to eat here, cannot think of any issues. It is very crowded at the entrance though so you have to knock a brother down sometimes and the bathrooms get a line sometimes. Try it!"}
{"text":"This location has the best service ! They are always for the customer, and the food is always good too! I literally have been ruined for all other restaurants on how great this place is, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were good.  The staff isn't that attentive, but they are still halfway decent."}
{"text":"I am a transplant from San Diego California.  I grew up spoiled on good authentic Mexican food. I have been looking for years for a good authentic Mexican restaurant. I finally found one. The food here is REALLY good. Their salsa has the right amount of hot and very tasty. I had the Fajita Bowl and it took me back home.  Their sangria was great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ok Mex if you happen to be nearby.  Wouldn't make a special trip. Crowded, but efficient service. Generic food, decent margaritas."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa. Hmm that is about all I have. Service inconsistent and  not engaged. Food comes out too fast. I do not want my meal in two minutes. Pretend it is not pre cooked please. But, alas it tastes like left overs. House margaritas also inconsistent in quality.  Reminds me of chi chi from 80s.  Can do better at home."}
{"text":"I'm with you Alan! The only thing I like here is the Chicken soup and the Margarita...I guess the food is ok if you are not too picky but my biggest gripe is (brace yourself) the service is tooo fast!!! 
I mean, really...they slap down the chips..(and the waiters always creep stare at my daughters, even the one that is obviously a minor, but we won't go there.) and before you even get to have a couple of chips and a few sips of your drink they are slapping down your entree..I feel like I'm eating on a running conveyor belt!! It makes me feel agitated..the whole experience is over in about 15 min, beginning to end. 
DO NOT go here if you feel like having a relaxing meal and some quality time to chat with your dinner partner..you will be feeling guilty for still being there in about 20 min flat."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is excellent and service fast. I crave this restaurants food. If you want good Mexican food I recommend this place over many I have been too."}
{"text":"I've been here too many times to count and the food is fantastic. Drinks are great, and cheese dip to die for."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast food. Even better margs. The waiters and waitresses are awesome, very funny and accommodating to what ever we need."}
{"text":"This is place never clean and we've gotten sick after eating here before, after we ate here the last time the server took the remainder of my child's water dumped it on the table and booth seat to clean the tables, and went to the next booth and used the same dirty water to do the same thing, how unsanitary, they should have a health code violation! That will be our last time eating here!"}
{"text":"Great food for a very reasonable price. We eat there or take-out about once a month. I took my friend from California and she was pleasantly surprised at the authenticity. Belly Rewards just add to the enjoyment. Highly recommend! Muy delicioso."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious Mexican food. I especially love the freshly made chips and salsa as well as the chimichangas and taco salad. I'm not a fan of the daquiris or margaritas because they're too strong with tequila for me. (and I'm pretty sure it's not top shelf....) Service is good, too!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite restaurants near home, Cozumel has fast service, good food, and delicious margaritas.  It is the place my friends and I go every time we come back \"home home.\" Today my sister and I went and got the queso dip which is the best around! It's creamy, gooey, and perfect with chips.  I always stick with tacos that are heaped with cheese, and Kelsey got #8 which is a platter with a burrito, taco, rice and refried beans.  We were both immensely satisfied, but we couldn't leave without fried ice cream- totally worth stuffing yourself to the brim as it is perfectly fried and crunchy on the outside with cool, creamy ice cream on the inside. Cozumel is delicious and a staple in the lives of people around here (you can tell since texting any friends \"I'm at Cozumel\" gets \"so jealous!\" Responses :) )"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night after a long day at work. The food itself was really good and came out surprisingly quickly after we ordered. I had the carne asada and highly recommend it. I like that it comes with fresh avocado slices instead of a guacamole salad. 

The reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is because the margaritas we ordered weren't good. They had an odd syrupy taste to them, as well as an overwhelming afterburn of tequila. Also, we felt that the waiters sort of hovered around us as if they were waiting for us to leave, which was sort of uncomfortable, and we were seated next to some kind of store room that had people booking in and out of it the whole time. 

I would go back and give them another shot because like I said, the food was great."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years!  It is consistently good and the Margaritas are perfect!  I hope the Baha Fish Tacos are a permanent part of their soon.  We still order them even though they are only on the seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and after reading other reviews I'm glad I'm not alone about the service providers.  Mucho non-friendly but the food is hot and good for the price.  The salsa with chips is just right esp. if you are having a light meal. I also recommend the  Frozen Margueritas - excellent."}
{"text":"Consistently Great food with prompt, polite and friendly service.   Excellent salsa and chips too.  
Sharon in Broadview Heights"}
{"text":"I love the Cozumel restaurants!  Lately though, the Broadview Hts location seems to need better ventilation.  I come home stinking like grease in my hair and jacket.  Also, I'd love to see them change out the ceiling lights.  They shine too bright onto the tables and doesn't help with ambiance.  Lastly, just a weird nit pick... It's awesome that they go thru so many jumbo margarita glasses a night, but every time my margarita is served, the glass is warm (like right out of the dish washer).  I'd love to see them buy a surplus so my marg is served in a chilled glass.  Now, all this being said, I'm not going to stop going there, but these things I've noticed over the past 6 months or so and it would just make our experience there that much better!"}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch.  The food was ok, it probably would have been better if it was the correct order.  The guy brought us a chicken chimichanga instead of beef.  If you ever ate there you'll know why I didn't send it back.  The service is terrible after they bring your food. Don't get me wrong everything is great up to the point when they put down your plate but after that, you never see them!  Half the time we just go to the register and tell them what we had and they ring it up."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food. Super fast and cant beat prices. Dine in or pickup. I suggest getting a side of queso cheese to dip chips in and pour over your food like the quesadilla."}
{"text":"My meal tonight was one of the few instances I have ever experiences where my food almost come back up while it was heading down. My wife and I rolled into Cozumel due to her overwhelming craving for Mexican food. I have come to terms with the fact that we will not find authentic Mexican cuisine in Cleveland but have had decent experiences at other restaurants in the area which I would at least consider edible. I have also been to the Cozumel in Independence and had a mediocre but not dreadful experience so I figured this would be similar. 

Let me first tell you the only decent thing I have to say about my experience tonight: I like their salsa. It has just the right amount of heat and is quite tasty. 

As far as the rest of it.... well, my wife and I decided we both wanted to get the Baha Tacos - a taco filled with a Cod filet, slaw, guac, and mango salsa. Sounds good, right? Barf. It was absolutely vomit-inducing. I literally heaved twice. First of all, the Cod is an odd choice for fish in a taco, but to be fair, I knew that's what was in it. The problem is that it was most certainly a frozen, already-prepared cheap filet in a very heavy deep fried breading. The slaw was essentially just cabbage drenched in mayo. The worst part was that the oil it was cooked in tasted rancid. I literally think the oil was bad. Both my wife and I couldn't finish it. 

Although the waiter was fairly unfriendly through our whole meal, he did offer to get my wife something new since she had only taken one bite. Her replacement meal was edible (Chicken Fajita Quesadilla) but was as far from authentic Mexican as you can get and by that point our appetites had pretty much already been ruined.

It's a good thing that the staff wasn't nice because there is now absolutely no reason for me to trick myself into going back to give it another try. Run for the hills!"}
{"text":"Amazingly authentic Mexican food in great atmosphere. Best Mexican  food I  have had in the greater Cleveland area  Nice beer and frozen drink selection as well."}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced and the service quick, especially when it isn't super busy.  As soon as we sat down, they handed out chips and salsa, but we didnt have too long to munch on them before we were given our sizzling fajitas.  They were also really good about substitions, following my annoying instructions to hold the rice, beans, and sour cream and sub corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Cozumel had 90 food inspections violations from 2016 to 2017. Source is Ohio Dept of Health records. Some included rodents and bugs in this establishment."}
{"text":"Your ONLY excuse to have never been to Cozumel is that you aren't from the North Eastern Ohio area. 

Food is fantastic, prices are beyond affordable on food, atmosphere is on point and the service is fast and polite! I have been here at least ten times throughout he last few years, probably twice that in my lifetime, and I have never been disappointed. Their excellence is consistent across the board.

To drink, I don't believe it's on the menu but if you're looking for a little buzz ask for the Corona Margarita. It's a fun, unique drink you won't be able to get most places. The bartender is generous so if you're not a drinker and you try it, probably not the best idea to drive!"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  We've tried this place twice in the last 6 months most recently 3 days ago.  and now we remember why we won't go back.  All the meats are totally overcooked - chicken, steak regardless of which dish your order.  Very scary that our to go order was ready in 5 minutes...which says that they pre-cook everything early and slap stuff together when someone orders it.  the meat was so awful.  We kept saying that Chipotle is a million times better and cheaper.  Shame on Cozumel for even producing this crap.  Speed in delivery does not compensate for horrible food.  We are so mad that we paid for the meals...next time we're in the mood for Mexi, we'll try one of many mexican restaurants within a 5 mile radius...or just head back to Chipotle!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome prices, really fast service, wonderful waitresses and waiters, excellent Margaritas! What more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food but lately they raised the prices and cut down portions on some of the menu items. Food is very quick to come out, you literally have 5 minutes from the time you order until the food comes out, which means the food is most likely already made ahead of time. Not sure what I think about that. Service is always good when we go and their sangrias are the best!"}
{"text":"This is by far my families favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. Always fast service, delicious food & amazing margaritas! My sister in law and I always get chimichangas- I'll always get chimichangas here! I love the rice too! And our other FAVORITE item - the white queso dip! The salsa is excellent too.

I love Cozumel & can't wait to try their new Richfield location!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a few friends and I have to say, the food was not too shabby.

We started out with chips with salsa, then with the cheese dip (highly recommend the cheese dip!). It has such a great casual atmosphere but is so lively that we felt no pressure to hurry up our conversation or move on to placing our orders.

When we did order, I got the enchilada with beef tips. When the food came out I was surprised to see how large the portion was. I thought the enchilada was tasty and it came with a nice helping of rice, tomatoes, guacamole and sour cream. I ended up taking half of it home. I will point out that I have no basis for knowing what an authentic enchilada should taste like. I really liked it but I can't say anything in regards to its authenticity. 

A friend got a vegetarian enchilada (that is an option!) which she was very satisfied with. The other two friends got taco salads which were also well received. Sadly I forgot to take pictures before we attacked the food...

Between the good food, good company, cheery atmosphere and randomly joining in to sing Feliz Cumpleaños to another patron - it was a great night. If you want to have even more fun, I hear the margaritas are great! 

Also, the price? My large enchilada turned out to be less than $10 which was fantastic! 

There's plenty of parking so coming as a group is never a problem, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Very very very good Mexican place. It is pretty authentic and the food tastes good, fresh and absolutely delicious! Too bad they don't have the Tacos Al Pastor, but that's okay!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that Cozumel indeed serves perfectly acceptable Mexican dishes that would certainly please a majority of their customers.  It is, however, my personal opinion that if a menu offers \"vegetarian\" options, that they are indeed vegetarian, and not simply a \"vegetable\" based option.  There are a vast number of Mexican restaurants whose rice is made with chicken stock and/or their beans contain lard, and Cozumel is included in this group.  A few miles north on the same street one can find Si Senor whose rice and beans are free from animal products and truly live up to their vegetarian claims."}
{"text":"I spent 9 1/2 long years living in Cleveland.  Being from Houston, I know good Mexican (and Tex-Mex) food.  Given the fact that they don't have ready access to the quality ingredients we have, they do a pretty decent job. They were about the best I found up there in Cleveland. Admittedly, they probably wouldn't last long in Houston or San Antonio due to the competition, but all in all, they did a decent job."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Cozumel today. Like always it was fast and great food. These guys and gals do an exceptional job. I frequent Cozumel a lot an they consistently get high marks for quality and service!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly.  Definitely the best Mexican food I've had from the area. Good for kids as well."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for our family. The complimentary salsa and chips are delicious (they give you medium to start, but if you like it more or less spicy you can just ask!) and all of the food is just spectacular. I like to change up my order every time (and have never been disappointed), but other members of my family will order the same thing over and over--just because it's that good!

Service is very quick and always on point. The vibe is fun and very relaxed. It's just a great place to grab a quick and delicious meal with the family (and overeat on chips and salsa!)"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Cozumel's for years. Great Mexican food at a great price. Their service is super quick. You can literally get in and out within 20 minutes on a non-busy day."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hugely popular in the Broadview Hts. area.  When other restaurants in the city have failed on numerous occasions, Cozumel has found a winning combination of great food, service, prices, and beverages.  You will almost always encounter a line, but it's worth the short wait, as everyone is served quickly.
Everything on the menu is delicious and fresh, and the service is great.  
A must visit for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service.  We had the shrimp and they were seated perfectly.  The guacamole was great and even had just the right amount of cilantro.  Great food at a great price.  Beverages are also very reasonable.  $1.99 Modelo Negra...."}
{"text":"The service is very fast at Cozumel.  The waiters are friendly and pleasant.  The food is okay when you want a quick Mexican meal that is not fancy, but is usually satisfying.  The queso dip is very good especially with flour tortillas to dip.  The salsa is very good too."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has beyond bland no flavor food. I admit the salsa and chips were good, thus the 1 star, but everything after that was just yuk, bland and zero flavor. 
Please don't waste your money if you are craving Mexican food drive a bit and get Good Mexican elsewhere."}
{"text":"The BEST authentic Mexican food in the area.  Reasonably priced, fast and fantastic."}
{"text":"Cozumel is to Mexican as Olive Garden is to Italian or PF Changs is to Chinese.  Frankly, it's for people who wouldn't know good Mexican food if it slapped them in the face with an empanada. 

If you like it, fine, but if you crave true Mexican food you need to visit either Mi Pueblo (one on Lorain seems to be better than the one on the East Side), or Nuevo Acapulco on Lorain, preferably the former. 

And what's so sad is this place is just minutes from where we live. Not QUITE as bad as eating at the Boneyard, but close."}
{"text":"Take out orders should be double, and triple checked for accuracy. We had to drive back, while our food got cold, because they left out not one, but two items. Come on guys. Let's get it right!"}
{"text":"I will start by acknowledging that we went to Cozumel on Valentine's Day. We expected and were okay with it being a little hectic. But everything from  our drinks (at $12.50 for a top shelf margarita, we couldn't believe they were tasteless, watery, zero alcohol and... carbonated?!) to our food (tamales and enchiladas) cold inside and simply not tasty) was so awful that we would never return. Sad, since we aren't THAT picky and were excited about finding a Mexican place within 10 minutes of home."}
{"text":"My favorites:  Mexican taco meal (3 tacos stuffed with grilled steak and chorizo, soft taco, onion/cilantro garnish), Ramon Special (grilled ribeye, veggies, cup of soup, etc.), Pescado (grilled tilapia, veggies, cup of soup, rice).  Winners them all!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the chiles relenos poblanos is excellent. 

Still, it seems like everyone that works there hates the customers. At first I thought they just hated me but then I noticed that the sneers and general sense of contempt was being dished out with every entree, cup of salsa and basket of chips.

If this seems like a weird sort of review from somebody who needs psychotherapy, check it out for yourself. You'll leave wondering if they mistook you for some guy who stiffed them on the tip a week ago. Its like they want to cuss you out the whole time.

The Cozumel in Independence isn't as crowded, the people don't hate you and the food is exactly the same...and exactly the same tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the number one Mexican restaurant on Cleveland yelp but the food is terrible; under seasoned except loaded with salt. 

The salsa, chips, and queso initially tasted good, but quickly were inedible because salt was the inky seasoning. Same with the rice and beans. No real seasoning except the salt. The chicken quesadilla had a large portion on unseasoned chicken (with plenty of salt and cheese), but I left part at the table, not because the portion was generous, but because it was hard to eat, I wasn't able to save it by adding the salsa (my usual trick) because the salsa was too salty. 

Service was good, but food is delivered too quickly to the table to think that any care went into the preparation of our meals."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I visited this, the original, Cozumel location.  I treated my dad and brother-in-law to some Mexican food on our way home from Stonewall.

My dad and I shared the Fajitas Grande, and as per usual, they were perfect!  It was $35 for all of our meals + tip and we were in and out in 30 minutes on the dot!  It took the usual 7 minutes to receive our food.

This visit surprised me a little because I can see that they have remodeled the entrance so that there is a little bar you can sit at and order food and watch TV.  Also, they have several female servers now, whereas they used to only have one or two in the past.

Service was still really good, the food was still really good, and the price was still really good.  I have never had a bad dining experience at this Cozumel.  They knock it out of the park every time!"}
{"text":"The in-and-out of Mexican.

Thursday Lunch-busy busy busy.   Got some chips and salsa dropped off at our table and ordered about 2 minutes later.  Food arrived about 5 minutes later on smokin' hot plates.  We both ordered off the lunch menu where most prices didn't exceed $7.  Every combination of beef/chicken with beans and rice in a different wrapping.  I think I ordered the burrito.  

I'm not a huge Mexican food fan, but it was convenient.  Wish I could have tried the margarita.  

Good service, seems to have many regulars for business lunches."}
{"text":"Great \"cheap Mexican\" restaurant in suburban Cleveland.  Can't go wrong with delicious salsa, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and chimichangas.  And it's all very reasonably priced, in a great atmosphere with good service."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food around Cleveland.  I miss it now that I'm in Chicago, it was right around the corner from my old house.  It's cheap, the Margaritas are strong, and the staff is really friendly.  The food was pretty authentic too and is made fresh and fast!!  They have a great patio out back that I used to frequent during the summer.  I can't say enough good things about this place, you need to go try it.  I will be visiting it soon when I'm home over Thanksgiving.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend very nice place. Food is great and comes out super fast and HOT. Service is good and friendly 
The only thing I don't like is there tends to be a lot of large groups that come in and it gets LOUD but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, reasonably priced, and nice portions. Service is always friendly and lightning fast. My favorite dishes are the super burrito and fajitas. Best chips & salsa, and fried ice cream, hands down!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We've been regulars since they first opened and have always had excellent food and service. You have the option to sit outside on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"Let's be honest...I may go to Cozumel too often but how could I not!? It's cheap and easily the best Mexican in town. I always get the same thing...grilled chicken soft taco and a cheese quesadilla. You can't go wrong. The food usually comes out in under 5 minutes and for the two of us our bill is always under $15...you cannot get this good of a meal anywhere else for that price. I have been to the other locations too but I prefer this one...A) right around the corner from my home B) much cleaner than other locations C) employees are always very friendly. When anyone asks me for a suggestion to Mexican food nearby this is it, hands down!"}
{"text":"We started going to Cozumel soon after we moved here over 10 years ago. The food and the service was great. The ingredients were good, they used real chorizo back then and the other ingredients were also very good. While it wasn't authentic the food was still very good. Our last two visits have been a big disappointment. The tortilla chips are not what they used to be and the salsa is very low grade. I think they are substituting spam for chorizo now and the carnitas are not near as good as they used to be. At least one of us on our last two visits had to send something back because it was cold in the middle. I told the cashier tonight that we noticed the degradation in the food quality and she said they might have changed food service providers. I would suspect that they may be using Restaurant Depot now and that could be the issue. If more long time customers would chime in maybe they would return to their previous quality levels. The service is still very good so I felt compelled to leave a good tip but I did let them know I would not return unless they improved the quality of the food. It used to be difficult to get a table on Friday nights it was easy tonight.

{"text":"Today was my first time at Cozumel, and I hope it's not the last. Our waiter was kind, patient, and funny as well. 
The complementary chips and salsa were amazing, and the queso (which costs extra) was delicious. It's undeniably better than the cheese sauce you get with pretzels from the concession stands at a football game.
I ordered three chicken tacos that came with a side of beans and rice. Their rice may not seem appetizing through pictures or even at first glance, but it's soft and amazing. (Growing up in a Chinese household, I eat rice almost every day, and Cozumel's rice surprised me in the best way.) The beans had cheese on top and paired well with the rice.
The tacos were overfilled with meat and cheese, and I finished all three easily. Although I personally could have done with less meat, I absolutely fell in love with the cheese. Every bite made my happier.
The food and service were both excellent, which was more than I could have asked for."}
