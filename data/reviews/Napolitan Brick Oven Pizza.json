Best takeout Pizza in Toronto!

Great Ingredients, very fresh and yummy.

Bring cash, it's worth it.

{"text":"After driving by this new pizza place for several weeks and being very interested to check it out as we are Italian, and love a good authentic pizza we finally came for lunch here today. We initially thought that we might take it to go but conversation with the owner was so comfortable that we decided to sit down and eat it. I can't say enough great things about how friendly the owner was and how great he was about explaining his ingredients, methods, and plans for the business. We ordered a large size pizza to share with bacon, pepperoni, and green peppers.  The owner made it fresh in front of us while having conversation with us and explained to us about the special oven that they use. This oven is one of 5 in Canada directly imported from Italy, a brick oven that is different from your typical wood burning oven. Now many people who are used to pizza from a wood oven will be used to a very thin crust, this authentic Napolitan is a little bit denser, moist and slightly chewier which I prefer. The owner asks how well done you will like the crust as well, if you did prefer it to be thinner and drier. He explained how because his crust was made to not have the typical air bubbles inside it and how they make the dough a day in advance with a high quality flour you do not experience that annoying pizza bloat after. This is true!!! From most pizza places I experience extreme bloating and feeling heavily weighed down after... This pizza does not have that sensation, you do not feel weighed down and lethargic after.   
Sauce was perfect. Not too acidic, and not like it had a bunch of sugar dumped into it like most pizzas taste nowadays, the tomatoes used are imported from a volcanic region in Italy. The mozzarella was the highlight of the pizza, excellent quality which he let us sample while the pizza was being made. He also provided us with an excellent high quality italian olive oil to put on the pizza, imported from Italy. You could tell how passionate the owner was about his ingredients and where they come from. After the pizza we decided to follow up with an espresso which was also excellent. I can't say enough great things about our interaction, service and experience. Hands down the most authentic pizza to find in Etobicoke, with high quality ingredients. Even better than Dimmi's in downtown Yorkville where I experience severe bloating everytime because of how they make the crust. We will be returning in the future and I suggest that you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, awesome service! You can tell the ingredients are fresh and the pizzas are all made with lots of love. Favourite pizza in the city!!

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can only give them 5 out of 5 stars. Their quality of food and service surpasses everything I have experienced before at a pizza shop. I order from there once a week and have yet to be let down. Keep up the great work and incredible service!!"}
{"text":"Found it to be expensive considering u can get the same quality from the logos pizzeria for significantly less $$. I'd also recommend the pizza at artisan's next store. its a much better tasting and made pizza. There also no delivery, no where to sit, and if your lucky the guy might wipe the table."}
{"text":"Excellent high quality pizza. Have been going here for a couple of years. Imported cheese and tomatoes make a hell of a difference. You don't taste sugar you can actually taste the tomatoes. Friendly owner who was very nice to my son. I am generally not a fan of Veggie pizza but the Margarita was phenomenal a perfectly balanced work of art. Worth the extra money check it out"}
{"text":"Had the folks over for dinner last night. Order a Large Special and Large Margarita.

The house House Special was awesome, lots of well cut, fresh toppings, nice not thin, thin crust and the right amount Cheese. Margarita for the kids was a winner as well, but the Special is amazing. 

Owner/operator was super nice, and gave us some homemade hot sauce for dipping, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Im not usually comfortable straying away from the safe mainstream pizza like Pizza Pizza, Dominos, and Pizza Hut, etc. 
I decided to try Napolitan pizza that was down and I absolutely loved it. You can really taste how the ingredients are much higher quality foods. The cheese is on the sweet side which is amazing, and the pepperoni is mouth watering. The place is never busy, the owner is an extremely nice guy. Dont miss out; its a little pricey but so worth it. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"We wanted to order in, but after finding out that Napolitan doesn't deliver, I decided I didn't mind the drive and went to pick it up. Glad I did, as I wouldn't have seen their amazing drink selection - the sparkling beverages from Italy in particular! We tried the Pina Colada and Mohito flavours (both virgin) and are now hooked! The pizza wasn't bad either ;) Actually it was delicious - very fluffy crust, light sauce, and fresher than fresh toppings. Bottom line - we'll be making the drive again!"}
{"text":"I used to come here quite frequently when it was located on Dundas. Unfortunately, haven't been back as much since it's been at the new location. I would also recommend the house special - so delicious and the ingredients are top notch!"}
{"text":"Unreal pizza, premo ingredients and quality. Compatible to the best you'll find in Manhattan. This guy knows how to make a pizza. Real Italian Espresso too, favourite pizza place in Toronto hands down."}
{"text":"We ordered the Napolitan special and it was excellent. Crust was very light and the pizza wasn't greasy. According to the owner (who was very nice), they use a different kind of flour that's why you can eat more and not feel heavy/bloated. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had my first pizza from Napolitan today.  I walked in and ordered a pepperoni and anchovy 16\" pizza.  Based on the price schedule it would be 20 bucks for a 16\" and 1 dollar for each topping.  So it should have been 22 bucks but they have an opening week special for a 16\" with free toppings for 20.  

I was told it was going to be about 25 minutes so what do I do?  I go back to my car and attempt to check into the business.  To my surprise there was no listing for the business so here I am phone on hotspot so I can connect to the internet and make a business entry.  I love making new business entries.  Anyway so I'm connected to the internet and filling it out and I get an email that somebody needed help in BC so I'm on the network fixing a problem... done.

Next I get a call from my president asking for help.  I end up helping him and by the time I'm done all that the pizza is ready.

I drive home to go have dinner and I open the box and here we go.

The pizza is very different from any chain pizza because it's not made like any of those.  I'll cut to the chase.  This pizza tastes like home made pizza and when I say home made I mean like my mother in law makes who is from Calabria.  

This pizza has a great amount of cheese on it.  The cheese was cooked so it wasn't stringy at all.  It's bubbled on so to speak.  The crust is different too.  It's really chewy but the bottom is not crunchy.  In my opinion it seemed to be a little overcooked in a sense that the crust wasn't too thin and like I said it was chewy.

They had a brick oven which literally isn't one of those ovens in the backyard made of bricks.  Their flyer says it's a Moretti Brick Oven from Italy.  That's unique.  

Also it says:

\"Family recipe using the best ingredients
Fresh vegatables hand cut daily
Fresh dough made daily
Fresh sauce using Italian tomatoes from Campania\"

I'm going to give it 3 stars only because I feel my pizza seemed a bit overcooked.  Besides that it was good.  It wasn't salty which I'm actually used to and that is another thing I pretty much immediately noticed.  Most chain pizza is saltier.  Try to not forget I had pepperoni and anchovy as my toppings both of which are pretty salty on their own.  It didn't seem that there was very much sauce but when I did get a taste of it, it tasted very good.  I hate acidic sauce with a passion.  Home made ingredients is always a big plus.

I will give them another chance but it was a good start and the place seemed pretty busy while I was there.  The location for this place is actually really good.  It's right near Kipling station and near all the high rise condos nearby.

TIP:  they seem to be cash only at least for now.  They are a new business so I'm guessing they are going to interac/credit card system soon maybe but for now (the first week) they seem to be running cash only."}
{"text":"Finally reopened in new location in No frills plaza beside south side burger.
Ordered a medium house special well done. Same fresh ingredients.
Crust is great. Just the right amount of cheese.
Great service ready in less than 15 min.
Lots of parking.
Have an espresso while you wait.
Hands down best local pizza."}
{"text":"I think I've found my favourite pizza place!!!! The Margarita Pizza is the best pizza I've ever had, it is so creamy and moist, and the basil was so fresh. Please do yourself a favour and try this pizza place you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place, the owner, the food, the service, the quality - fantastic! I seriously don't know where to start without writing a novel. My husband and I moved to Etobicoke and tried this place after months of driving by it. The pizza is seriously one of the best I've ever had and the owner is super nice! I just hope they don't raise their pricing once they move to the new location, that'll be obnoxious!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large Margarita pizza for Friday family night. 
Crust - Bang on... 
Sauce - tasted like strained tomatoes right out of the bottle.  Had no flavour, lacked salt!! 
Cheese - not bad
Toppings - had a total of 6 basil leaves... 

Overall - would I spend top dollar for strip mall pizza? - No way!  Not returning."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago I know good pizza, and this pizza is great!! But the service was even better!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighbourhood, specially Rappini pizza ..... AMAZING !!!!!
The owner is the nicest guy , great service , clean place Wow .... many reasons to come back and make it my favorite place to have delicious pizza !!!! Don't miss it !!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Got half loaded with toppings and half with just pepperoni. Usually I love extra toppings but in this case it took away from the quality of the sauce and the cheese. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! At $5 for a slice, it's not cheap. 
Not as good a il paesano but sure beats a couple other local spots. 
Only blemish... 
No matter how many times you order JUST A SLICE, he always pesters u to get a drink, that's annoying."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazingly fresh and delicious tasting pizza!! The crust is crusty but not too thick or heavy. The tomato sauce is not acidic or watery! The ingredients taste so fresh."}
{"text":"Always, always,  always consistent with a delicious pizza! This is by far our favourite pizza place in the city. The owner knows his stuff and is so nice! My husband and I always order our own pizza as I am always up for trying something new and he likes to keep it the same. My favourite is the Margherita and his is the House Special with green olives.  I also have made my own and gone with the owners recommendation and never been steered in the wrong direction.  Eat here, trust me!"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a few months now and finally got to check it out last week.  Here's my review:

First and foremost, don't go with the expectations of gourmet pizza like a certain spot in Mimico.  Take it for what it is, which is good, fresh, homemade tasting pizza. We ordered the 14 inch Napolitan House Special (thin crust) but substituted green olives for green peppers.  It was a good move because it added a nice natural saltiness.  The pizza was exceptional!  Very tasty crust with a little bit of chew, no grease whatsoever, ingredients were super fresh and the sauce tasted homemade - not like typical chain pizza Ragu sauce.  What I really appreciated was how friendly and accommodating the owner was and how the pizza was ready in time.  My only complaints would be that I wished the sauce was a bit more seasoned (but that's just my preference) and I couldn't really taste the bacon (wish there was more). However, with that being said, we still plan to go back.

I think as time goes on and when he starts to see more business, he should think of offering gourmet toppings because with that crust, it would be killer!  I'm going to rate it 4.5/5 because I couldn't really taste the bacon. Again, I always try to encourage support of local businesses.  I really, really wish him luck and hope it stays open as the pizza really outstanding.  Great location too!"}
{"text":"This pizza is one of the best in the city! The owner takes pride when preparing it and only uses fresh dough and ingredients. I have to say I love it but I wish I could have it delivered!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend you try this place for take out. I Walked in at around 6:30 and ordered large 3 topping. It was $22 and well worth it. It took about 15 minutes and was still piping hot when I got home. You can taste the freshness and see the beautiful toppings that makes it stand above the chain delivery restaurants.  Give them a try, let's support local.  They do have a few tables as well as pizza by the slice but I would say it's more of a take out place."}
{"text":"Came here with my best friend before we went to a movie and received wonderful service from Michele! He offered us cappuccino to start and we ordered a margherita pizza. Super delicious! The real deal. He is from Naples and the pizza was definitely a reflection of that. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that I don't 'love' pizza, I know... shocking right? It was one of those hot summer nights and I really didn't want to cook and as usual we couldn't decide on what to order. I really wasn't feeling pizza but my BF convinced me that we should try this new place that he's been hearing about, sure why not. The BF calls them up and the owner decides to give us a deal since it's our first time, $20 for a 4 topping large, sweet right? The owner also mentioned how the brick oven was made in Italy etc. and that it is the BEST pizza and we're missing out.... OK THERE, I'll be the judge of that! We get it, we dig in and you know what? It is the best pizza I've ever had!! The crust alone sealed the deal, it was chewy and soft, definitely more homestyle like other reviews have said. The pizza also wasn't overly greasy and you can tell the toppings are fresh. We've gone back a 2nd time already and will be repeat customers for sure, finally my BF was right about something lol.  

FYI, cash only."}
{"text":"Ordered a 14\" Primavera pizza. It was cold and meh! Have ordered by the slice before and enjoyed it. May be it was just an off day. May not order a full pizza again and may stick to slices."}
{"text":"The crust is very thin, it should be an option because I didn't order a thin crust pizza. Seems to be owner's idea to reduce cost. The pizza is also lacking sufficient tomato sauce to bring out that pizza flavour.

By the way, they charge 2 dollars for a pop. Don't get ripped off."}
