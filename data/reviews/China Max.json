{"text":"We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience."}
{"text":"The food was great. The chicken was delicious. I recommend this place if you're shopping at Carolina Place Mall."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening abt 5:00pm, 1st & only time eating at China Max.  My daughter ordered 1/2 fried rice & 1/2 chow mein noodles, and the Teriyaki Chicken.  She said it didn't taste well at all ( and she loves Chinese food!), so I tried a bite of each.  The rice was very over-fried & crusty, very over soy-sauced too.  The chow mein noodles were very oily, over soy-sauced, and no veggies in it, except for cabbage (or maybe it was onion; couldn't really tell what veggie it started out as).  The teriyaki chicken was very, very sweet - too sweet for our taste.  The chicken had a rubbery-like texture, and was just drowning in the sweet teriyaki sauce.  We just closed the lid on the styrofoam box, and threw it in the trash!  Not going to go back!"}
{"text":"I tried the half of the restaurant that is clearly similar to Panda Express, so I'll write the review from that standpoint. The lo mein vs Panda's chow mein is two different worlds. Holy hell is the lo mein better. That's where the good part ends. The terriyake chicken was bland and dry. The orange chicken was over cooked and extremely sticky. One thing I will say is that you get a TON of food for not very much money. I spent 7.50ish and got a heaping so large, an anorexic person wouldn't be able to lift it!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely terrible. I would recommend to never go there. They give the good Chinese food out as samples and then give you terrible food when you go buy some. Way overpriced me and my fianc√© literally took two bites and had to throw it away it and go somewhere else it was so disgusting. Save your time and go somewhere worth eating."}
{"text":"I think their services have been improved, cox their staff were really nice, and the food is really good. Better than other usual fast food."}
{"text":"the owner was dishonest, she posted a menu outside with lower pricing to attarct traffic, and then charge higher pricing menu inside. she also charge me 12% sales tax, which is illegal in tempe, which suppose to be only 9.3% very rude manner, not recommended"}
{"text":"Had the spices burbon  chicken. It clearly had been sitting along time. Got all the scraps and couldn't eat. Asked for refund and they were very ride and talking in foreign language. Didn't sound Chinese. Terrible food and even worse customer service. Never eat here"}
{"text":"I made a huge mistake in this place... the uldon soup color is too dark and unclear.. it looks unhealthy. go go another place~!!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible , very syrupy . No flavor in noodles . General Sto's was artificial DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Seriously so gross.  I had read other positive reviews about this place so decided to try it.  Called for delivery and was told they were only delivering within a mile of the location due to lack of employees.  Ok, I'll pick up.  Ordered 3 dinner combos (2 sesame chicken and one sweet and sour chicken) and an order of chicken lo mein.  Arrived to pick up and stood in the front for a good 5 min before anyone even came into the dining area.  I should have taken the totally empty place as a sign.  Anyway, food was awful.  Egg drop soup and sweet and sour sauce were obviously cut with water and probably more than half.  Sesame chicken was mushy and tasteless.  Tried to add some hot mustard for flavor and even that was bad!  How do you have bad hot mustard?!  Will NEVER eat here again and wish I had my $35 back.  Oh and when I was there I asked for a menu and she said they were out of the paper to-go menus.  Really?!?"}
{"text":"What a damn discrase I tell you, I just wanted to order it simple sweet and sour chicken and a side Of veggie fried rice. Well guess what this place doesn't serve sweet and sour chicken. What the hell kinda Chinese place doesn't serve sweet and sour chicken.The chicken was chewy and the rice was like eating dried up horse shit. The egg role was the only DECENT thing about the damn place. Even the service was bad the person you can't damn well understand and she doesn't even take time to get the damn order right. Oh and the meals are over priced for shit. And to top it all off the damn soda was dis flavored. I wish you dint even have to leave a star in the rating because this place doesn't deserve one. I have read other reviews on this place and I have heard other terrible things . And it also made my stomachs hurt. \"PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this location a one star rating because of three reasons: lack of customer service, price and the quality of food. When I approached them, the team members were conversing amongst themselves. I felt like I was rushed to order what I wanted so they can carry on with their conversation. I did not feel welcomed at all and it was a lot of awkward silent moments as I was paying for my meal. Second, I believe this is much overpriced for just \"okay\" food. Third, one of the team members offered a free sample of the orange chicken and it was freezing cold. I immediately got the kung pow instead."}
{"text":"I'm staying on the Strip, I need someplace reasonably priced to eat lunch, I don't want to go far, and I want it to be easy to take it back to the room.   Thank you China Max for fulfilling my needs!"}
{"text":"China Max,  they get me with the samples every time.  I had the salt and pepper shrimp two pieces for a dollar!!! The shrimp was huge not particularly peppery but tasty none the less.   My kid sister was not pleased with her General Tso's it was bland and gummy and the lo mien noodles that she got with it were drier than the Sierra desert."}
{"text":"Full disclosure I didn't eat here, but I was walking by and the lady held out a morsel on a toothpick for me to taste. Said it was bourbon chicken. Was very sweet,  too sweet for my taste, plus it was cold and rubbery like it had been sitting out for hours. I asked if they had anything spicier then looked at what they had and saw another dish labeled spicy bourbon chicken. I asked if I could taste that, and the lady pulls out a toothpick,  spears a chunk, then asks me what kind of rice or sides or something I wanted. I said I wanted to taste the spicy, and she says one taste and wouldn't hand me the toothpick. She just lost a sale, so I went next door and got some teriyaki. Which was pretty good, and nice and hot."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a guilty pleasure, this is your spot. I was craving orange chicken and was happy to find the 2 meat and 1 side special for $5.99. Got a side of veggies instead of rice or noodles to be a little healthier. At least that's what I'm telling myself. The spicy orange chicken was crispy and didn't have too much breading, which I like. Overall, the food tasted pretty fresh."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews first but I was starving.  Do not eat here, it is way overpriced even by mall standards. My Mom had a cup of soup and a water and it was $4.50 She did not even enjoy the soup. I had Kung Pao Chicken and it was just a salty sauce that had no pow. My Rice Bowl was almost $7. We all know mall prices are higher, but you better serve something that tastes better. There are other choices but next time I will just eat elsewhere till they stop price gouging at malls and airports, because no one ever said,\" I had the greatest meal at the mall or airport\""}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! Not the best, but this pregnant lady tore it up! I would definitely go back! Pleasant, fast, service."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service was pretty bad. The staff was rude and the portions were small. I would not recommend going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Last week, I visited this place. It is conveniently located in Carolina Place Mall. There were 2 Chinese ladies. It was a little difficult to communicate with them in English. Thanks for the Cafeteria style. I could point out this and that. Menu is limited, but they serve generous portions, very reasonable, and very good tasting."}
{"text":"Was on the run and grabbed China max real quick for me and friends.   Broccoli beef, walnut shrimp and Angus beef were all perfect ! I didn't have anything to complain !  5 stars"}
{"text":"Looking for something to eat real quick and not too pricy before we head to events and we came across this hidden gem. Hearty portions. We had the #2. Two choices is noodles. Bourbon chicken and orange chicken. If you check in you get 10% off. So win win. My bf and I shared the plate and we got full. Good place to stop for a quick and affordable lunch. The food itself was good too! I'm giving it four stars just because no free refills."}
{"text":"After feeling down after a long afternoon of shopping at Ross Park Mall this weekend, I was starving and just had to get something in the food court. I hate eating in the food court and opted for China Max since the line was nonexistent compared to the thirty people swarming Chick-fil-A. A sample of the Orange Chicken confirmed that I wasn't making a terrible decision.  I ended up ordering the Orange Chicken with Fried Rice and Crab Rangoons. I was very surprised - it was all delicious (especially for under $7)! The Orange Chicken was tender with great flavor and a good amount of sauce. The Fried Rice was also tasty and well-seasoned, and I saw a descent amount of egg mixed throughout (my favorite part of fried rice). I loved the three Crab Rangoons, which had a lot of warm, gooey filling.  Is it silly and embarrassing that I look forward to going back to Ross Park again to eat in the food court? Yes, it is, but I know that I will be craving China Max sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a ZERO star for this review. I have NEVER experienced a lady so rude and bitchy!! we ordered a China max bowl and it was going well, and then I said I wanted a medium CUP. I never mentioned what drink we wanted because we were still deciding. when I told the register lady that we wanted a lemonade drink, she said, \"do you guys still want your coke?\" Or something about a coke. I never said I wanted a coke. Maybe the other lady thought I said coke, but even if, you can just EASILY replace the drink to a lemonade. You misheard us. So it's your responsibility to kind of apologize and maybe say, \"I'm sorry I thought you guys said Coke, I'll give you guys the lemonade in a second\"??? But she was just SO rude about it! shaking her damn head at me and slammed the drink there, are you serious? I work at a food place, I KNOW the difference between a rude customer and a nice one. I was never rude to her because I know how it feels like to be rude at an employee for no reason but she just treated me like I was stupid or something!! AND when we were at the register and I glanced at her, she was STILL shaking her head like she WANTED me to see that she's mad. At this point I was ready to write this review. We got charged extra for something that we DIDN'T want. we took it anyway because the lady serving us just looked like she was about to explode and wanted us out of there, even though we were nice to her the whole time. Needless to say I am never coming in here again. I do NOT recommend this place at all!!!! should've read the reviews here before we ordered. SHAKING MY DAMN HEAD."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of eating here and regretted it. Noodles was bland, had no flavor. I wasn't sure that the meat in my beef and broccoli would constitute as meat, sure didn't taste like it. Do yourself a favor and walk past this place."}
{"text":"We've dined here before and opted to get some food to go from this restaurant instead of Pei Wei and Panda Express.  I just get sick of the food at those businesses.  It's a skeleton staff but polite, knowledgeable and efficient.  The bar options are very limited and I'm not sure if it's because of a pending delivery or what.  At China Max, every time we have dined or had take out it has been good.  We have a couple of favorite dishes that got our attention when they were lunch specials - Mango Shrimp and Garlic Chicken. Tonight we went with Pot Stickers and two orders of Mango Shrimp and Sesame Chicken, no spice.  While waiting for our order I had a Tsing Tao and my son had a Dr. Pepper. Our bill for the two beverages, an appetizer and three entrees was $30 and some change.  Our food was delicious, shrimp wasn't over cooked and plenty of mango and shrimp.  Red and green bell peppers, red and white onion, baby corn, zucchini, snow peas, carrots, lots of sweet mango and plenty of shrimp.   Pot stickers were tasty, with or without the sauce. Rice was warm and sticky - ideal for eating with chopsticks. Husbands Sesame Chicken was lightly battered, tossed with a semi sweet sauce similar to teriyaki and sesame seeds.  He said it was really good and couldn't eat it all."}
{"text":"Horrible! The rice was not fully cooked and crunchy. I told them and they said that's how they liked it. At least they offered something else in place of it. The noodles were dry and hardly had any flavor. The pepper steak and bourbon chicken had a bad chemical aftertaste. The spicy orange chicken was OK. I would not recommend ordering from there."}
{"text":"This little mall quick restaurant was right by our hotel- and was a nice inexpensive break from most Vegas food. The two people working were very kind despite having no air in 100+ heat which is more than I would be able to give in that heat. The bourbon chicken and orange chicken were good. Fried rice was very bland. Pluses: quick, good tasting, friendly service Negatives: seating area was very dirty"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try a new place. My family told me about this place and thinking that it was new to all of us, I agreed. I was a little cautious because of their reviews. We went during lunch time on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. The waitress quickly seated us. She was very prompt with taking out orders. I can't exactly remember the dish I had, but it came with a little bit of everything. I will be the first to say that I am a very picky eater and I cleared my plate. I was very impressed with my meal. I would def. go back and try another meal for sure. Pricing was decent too! Not too expensive for the amount of food you get. Plus when my brother asked, they gave us extra fortune cookies! This place gets an A from me!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place another chance. To start service is everything. During my last visit I was not greeted, i was giving the attitude that I was an \"inconvenience\" to the two workers there. I ordered fried rice, & mushroom chicken.  Rice was dry, not much flavor. The mushroom chicken was a bit better but yet I've had better. The cashier talked to her co worker and paid no attention while I waited to hand her my signed receipt slip. No thank you and she walked alway. Yes real pleasant. This was about 6 months ago.   Now for today's visit...  There was again two females working at around 4PM. Still no greeting, still given that look as if they were interrupted again. She didn't ask if I wanted my meal take out or dine in but I did say take out. I ordered a bowl and she handed me my food without a lid. I kindly asked for a lid and she gave a big sigh like it's so damn had to put a lid on a bowl!  Walked on over to the cashier who was taking with that rude server. No hi, no do you need anything else, I asked for a bag and she just handed it to me. Yes it must be VERY difficult to bag my meal as well. No thank you. This place is seriously a joke. I'm going to do both these rude workers and myself a favor by not returning.  It's just a fair warning, unless you want to be served food that's less than average while being served by people with attitudes just as bad, I'd avoid this place. There's much better out there."}
{"text":"Don't go here. They served us cold food and then told us that it always gets cold fast. They did offer our money back right away but it would have been nice if they could have just served us hot food. Their steam tables aren't keeping anything hot. I'm not sure how they stay in business."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for another place that apparently closed, so we wound up here.  Oops.  We thought other names for the place might be:  China Minimum.  China Don't.  China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.  The service was nice enough but nothing else was.  The lipstick on the spoon that came with my daughter's egg drop soup pretty much set the tone.  The veggie chow fun and the veggie fried rice were sub-unremarkable.  The baby corn was overly large (we called it toddler corn) and had a musty flavor.  Ug.  The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.  The veggie fried rice was OK.  Oh, we started with crab puffs.  They were overly oily and had no crab flavor.  Just call it China Don't and leave it at that."}
{"text":"Walked up the China Max to get food with my boyfriend and the American manager standing there (not either of he two asian workers) asks us if she can help us as she stands next to the food CUTTING HER NAILS. Like are you freaking kidding me?! Absolutely disgusting. Never ever coming here again. Someone needs to sit that woman down and teach her proper hygiene and etiquette around food & then fire her."}
{"text":"I forgot to mention that China Max was giving out free samples during our Ross Park Mall ordeal, and in sampling their food, I found that they make a sesame chicken that is as tender and sweet as a grandmother's hug. We didn't want to fill up too much since we were waiting 2.5 hours for a seat at Cheesecake Factory and opted for a snack at  the sub-par Oh Oh Burrito instead to tide us over.  Thus ends this Public Service Announcement. Hating on Ross Park Mall will resume."}
{"text":"One of the worst Chinese ever  There is people cooking back there but it tasted like it was straight out of a can Never again"}
{"text":"You cannot find a better deal for good chinese food. They are very friendly and they will let you try a sample of any meat outur chicken before you can buy it. The Orange chicken is the best as well as the lo mein noodles too. I would recommend giving them a chance and enjoy the good food too."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical of this place when I walked in and I was the ONLY person in the whole restaurant. I waited for 2 mins before someone came to greet me. I contemplated leaving while I was standing alone at the entrance of the restaurant, but I'm glad I stayed and dined here because it turned out to be pretty good!  Food:  1) Hunan beef: stif fried beef with broccoli, bell peppers, onions, carrots, and snow peas with a thicker soy sauce like sauce with a hint of spiciness. I thought the beef was very tender and the veggies were very tasty. The sauce was calibrated just right and the whole dish came together very nicely.   2) Seafood and bean curd hotpot: I was disappointed with this dish because it came out very dry and bland. All the ingredients didn't really feel like they came from the same dish, and it tasted almost like they were just thrown together last minuet. There was real squid, shrimp and mussels in the dish but the crab meat was imitation, which made the dish less appealing. If it were up to me, I would leave out the imitation crab meat because it only tainted the dish and made it seem cheap.   3) Pong nong? chicken: Gosh, I forgot the name but it was one of the specials that the waitress recommended. BEST dish of the night! The chicken was very well marinated and so tender! The veggies tasted perfect. The SAUCE was what highlighted this dish! A little on the salty side but very well calibrated with just the right amount of spicy kick to it! Almost like a mix between soy sauce, hoi sin sauce and oyster sauce (but I'm probably way off). It was just delicious! I really recommend it! (Too bad I don't remember the exact name of it)  4) Stir fried choy sum: Loved it! Very fresh and simple, just the way Chinese vegetables should be stir fried.   Service: By far one of the BEST waitresses I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. I don't have very high expectations for waiters at Chinese places but because food and not service is what Chinese restaurants emphasize, but I've got to say, she was so friendly, nice and helpful. I asked so many annoying questions about the menu and she was very eager to answer them and she knew the menu like the back of her hand. She checked on me several times during the meal and never left me with an empty water cup, she was fantastic!   Ambiance:  They can sure improve the ambiance in this place. Dim lighting combined with a run down look makes this place very unappealing. The booths were uncomfortable and the large fish tank at the front of the restaurant looks very dirty. I question if those gold fishes are happy in that tank. It's a very shabby, hole in the wall type feel.   Price:  Very reasonable for the food you are getting! With everything that I ordered, it only came out to $40 (that's tax and tip included!). The meal probably could have fed 3-4 people, which would only come out to be like $10 each person? I ate by myself, so it was kinda a pricey meal for just myself, but still very reasonable for all the food I got to take home! Yay for left overs!   Overall:  I would totally come back if I weren't so far away. You should definitely try this place. There are a lot of mixed reviews for this place, so I guess take my review for a grain of salt, but if you pay close attention, all the bad reviews are from people that ordered \"Americanized\" Chinese food. Try the more authentic dishes and ask the waitress for recommendations. It makes a difference!"}
{"text":"My friend dragged me to Ross Park Mall (my first time being there) for this place and it's a pretty OK American-Chinese food place. I mean the food was hot and fresh, service was fast, people were nice, and the food was flavorful. It's nothing stellar but as far as expectations go for mall American-Chinese food, it's not bad at all. Probably better tasting food than most take-out places. And the prices aren't horrible either. If I came to this mall again, I'd definitely eat here again if I was craving American-Chinese food."}
{"text":"I would gladly recommend the meal I ordered at ChinaMAX to everyone, the One Entree Orange Chicken and Rice."}
{"text":"Their customer service is horrible and their manager is no better!  To be located in a tourist targeted mall, they should learn to treat people better.  Afterall, we are the reason you are in business."}
{"text":"Love this place I go to the mall just to eat here when i cant think of anything cheap to eat. The spicy bourbon chicken is the best! Orange chicken here is my fall back. Always get your order to go,and you get about 30% more food at no extra cost,just because they like to fill the plate here,no written rule. Always have leftovers"}
