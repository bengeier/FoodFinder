{"text":"Tehran is a wonderful establishment.

I've been an infrequent visitor for the past 10 years. I always wish I'd go more often.

The menu doesn't have too many options. But the choices you have are so flavourful that you won't feel lacking.

The plate sizes are quite large, though I have noticed that portions decreased a bit recently, and prices went up. Worry not, you'll still be stuffed and not spend too much.

Everyone should give Tehran a try. The food is delicious and the service is quick. And shame on someone rating a restaurant they've never been to and making a judgment based on hearsay."}
{"text":"all good things come in 3s? add one more to the theory - Atmosphere, Service, & Food

Atmosphere:  Tehran's atmosphere is the direct result of its history - its history in Montreal as well as the history of its cuisine.  Tehran, which has had its doors open for well over a decade (perhaps closer to two) is in fact an Iranian rather than a Middle Eastern restaurant.  Although Iranian cuisine consist of much (much) more thank just koobedeh (akin to kebab) and flavoured rice, Tehran makes a good business from offering the types of Persian dishes that the west has come to expect.  Often frequented by many of the Persian community (a great sign), visit Tehran durning the month of Ramadan and see it buzz with families gathering for their Iffar (breaking of the fast) meal for a really unique experience.

Service:  No objections on the efforts of the staff - they are kind and very willing to wait a few extra moments so that patrons can choose what they want.  The staff certainly works hard (the place is often at capacity during dinner times) and so may be a little late in responding to requests.

Food:  Tehran's food is well cooked and flavourful.  However, it may be a little too quickly cooked at times, and appear overly oily.  The menu is generous but not full to the point of being prohibitive.  The wide selection of koobedeh and other meat dishes is the real attraction - but remember, these are but a small (small) sample of what Persian food really is (same as saying that Lebanese people don't just eat Shawarmas, Hummus, and Falafel either ;O)

Good family atmosphere, clean, and generous."}
{"text":"This place got me excited over rice and chicken. Two simple dishes made exceptionally well at Tehran. Their chicken is tender and well marinated. Their rice is well cooked and well spiced (not too under or over cooked). I even sampled some of their beef and was very impressed The portions are great too, which makes the already reasonably priced restaurant even better! You get your money's worth and more. I'll take one line to mention how warm and fantastic their tea is! Must try overall."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is horrible. 2 servers for the entire restaurant. They are very rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal summer 2013. My friends warned  bout their terrible experience in this restaurant, but I figured they are maybe too picky. I  had dinner with my wife, the food was ok, not very special, but the waitresses and the owners are very careless and rude. I strongly recommend everyone to stay away !!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the ambiance was really welcoming.. they were open even though it was the worst weather and everything else was closed! 
Thierry chicken was tinder and rice us really tasty .. once complaint though the beef wasn't well done even though we asked it would be well done..
Would definitely come back again.."}
{"text":"Mix of traditional and contemporary Persian food with a few vegetarian options. Large plate sizes generally consisting of grilled meat plus rice and tomato. Meals come with starter ash soup (our server told us over 50 ingredients go into making it!!!) or salad and tea (although on my particular visit they only remembered to serve half of my party tea). Service is quick-food came out within 15 minutes!

Nice dinning room. Generally friendly staff (although I have also heard of poor management) but they did tend to rush us out the door despite not being particularly busy. Also, 3 or 4 different servers came to our table at different times...lack of communication or weird dinning service structure...?

Overall a nice spot for sit down Persian food. Miles above the city's plethora of kebab joints. My only complaint would be the service style, which make me not want to return."}
{"text":"Food is very good but not the best Iranian out there. Had difficulty trying to find a parking spot. The food is a bit overpriced. It is a family friendly restaurant. The service was not quick but they were polite and helpful. Worth the try."}
{"text":"For a third time visit we decided to change out picks from the menu
This time one friend of mine was with us too
Unfortunately there is a considerable drop in quality perceived
On the other hand, compared to other places I've dined since last I was at Tehran, the price looks ridiculously high
I say Chateau Kebab which is not a specifically Persian food restaurant does much better
I ordered Zereahk polo: the rice smelled bad and the chicken breast did not taste good at all
As well the Zereshk is supposed to be a bit fried and mixed will pistachios it wasn't!
The chicken kebab was not perceived well by my company
I don't know if this is a change in my taste or Tehran's menu but I reconsider my Persian food favorite away from Tehran!!
By the way they do not have a portable POS and you need to go to the cashier to pay. I assume this could be fixed way easier than improving the meb"}
{"text":"Besides their artificially high prices, I had a very bad experience at this place. We went there to have a soup (Persian Ash), but they refused to take our order initially with the excuse that we have to order main entry too. And we decided to leave. They seem greedy wanting to make maximum profit from their not so great service."}
{"text":"They use to be impolite even with Iranians but I see they've changed the manner with new staffs ! On the other hand foods are very nice and give you an idea about real persian foods !!! It worth if you wanna pay $30 for your meal !"}
{"text":"Despite having mammoth sized portions, and well in my opinion overpriced kebab, they have the nerve to say \"you cannot share\" or \"you must order an appetizer\", literally forcing you to order extra food even though the sultani costs $30.00 already. That is a poor excuse for customer service and downright greed. Basically \"give me more money or else\". Then the lukewarm soup comes and there is a nice long piece of arm hair in my soup, which signals poor hygiene. Then the kebab comes and it is very greasy. Then the tea comes and it's definitely been watered down. The worst part is that I had been coming for years before the quality hit the bottom, and before they somehow decided to dictate how you order your food. Not more than 20 years ago the place was a favorite of cab drivers, now it is they type of establishment that exudes everything you don't want to find in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Their \"barg\" kabob is very delicious. Did not give 5 stars because of the rice. It was not cooked well. \"Ashe reshteh\" was very good. Salad was fresh. Overall very good only rice could improve and service was slow. I would stop by again to have \"ashe reshte\" and \"barg\" kabob."}
{"text":"Tehran is definitely the finest Persian restaurant in the city. The quality of the food is excellent. Everything is fresh and delicious. The decor is very tasteful and elegant as well, and the service is what you'd expect from a fine cuisine restaurant. The prices are reasonable, I really have nothing negative  to say about Tehran."}
{"text":"This place has been open for so long.

I've been 3 times in the past 20 years, all trips were consistently good.

The restaurant is very beautiful from inside and out. 
It's a large open room, and the neat thing is they serve alcohol (a rarity for Iranian restos).

The Ash soup is a heavenly delight, it's a must

The prices are a bit too high for my taste, but the koobideh and crazy chicken ($16 and $17, are still pretty decently priced. Other items are in the 20-30 range.

You do get soup or salad, as well as tea at the end included with all the dishes.

There is pita bread with onions to open your appetite.

Service is cordial, but nothing exceptional

They do a brisk takeout, the Iranian community lives in the area and they are close to Vendome Metro."}
{"text":"I have to boycott this place for ethical reasons. I've never been here before so I might be biased but past co-workers have said that the owners don't treat their staff very well and only pay them in tips under the table. I hate to be a bother but when I hear things like that I never want to go here."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional costumer service, Ash was good but kabab Barg taste  was disgusting! The owner was very rude!"}
{"text":"I give this rate just because of the owners son who is a very nice gentleman other wise the rate would be one. After about twenty five minutes & three times request we had the water .the appetizer came to the table , no plates . For having the plates we had to keep asking the servers. The salmon fish main course was fried too much outside & inside was raw, when we asked to change the meal their answer was we will be charged for that . Three times we had to talk to the owners son for the problem. After 40 minutes the other meal came, the rest of the table were down.The rice was not cooked enough. Ghormeh sabzi very good. The khashko bademjan very nice.Ash delicious.the barg kabab tast good.The service very slow,need to have more smile."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday night with the family. They raved about the place so I was looking forward to it. Very Meh. Biggest complaint was the staff. They weren't rude, just moreso slow and inept. They rarely checked in on us and it took forever for us to order. They weren't very busy either. Menu is okay, but seems pretty pricey. I ordered the jajeh and the chicken was probably the most moist chicken I've had. It was very very good. Everything else was okay. I agree with the thought that Tehran's food is well cooked and flavourful.  However, it may be a little too quickly cooked at times, and appear overly oily. Would I come here again, yeah. Would I come out of my way to come here, nope."}
{"text":"For a weekend trip to MTL, my partner and I wanted to try something new! We really enjoyed Tehran Restaurant. I got the Sholo Kabab and my partner got the Barg Steak. Both of our meats were cooked well and seasoned beautifully. Not only was it generous on the rice (and even the meat), it was also really nicely presented! We have no doubt that we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great quality and friendly staff - 
My girlfriend had the Crazy Chicken and I had the Barg - both were Delicious !! Must try"}
{"text":"Great service! Food was pretty good as well. Not a whole lot to say as I don't know much about Persian food, but what I had was good. I had the \"Crazy chicken\" that indicated on the menu was spicy, but wasn't spicy at all. Other than that everything was good."}
{"text":"Food is at par with Khurasan nearby i.e., excellent. But Tehran is quite pricy - at least 20% higher.

That's probably because of the decor and ambience which is definitely far better than Khurasan.

Due to this price difference I rate it 1 star less than Khurasan. Those looking for ambience might have a different opinion."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent cuisine, refined, tasty, unique spices. Good-sized portions. The decor was quaint, pleasant, cozy. Very nice friendly atmosphere. In short, an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"The food to price ratio is perfect, the sultani is great and order the number 2 chicken, and the soup is amazing.

I've been there three times already and have not been disappointed until now."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Persian food and I was disappointed by this place. The koobideh was dry so I'd definitely wouldn't go back. I'm all about a yummy juicy koobideh. 

I have yet to find an amazing Persian restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food was good but a little pricing for lunch. You are getting lots of food thou but then you are sleeping at work.

The chicken and beef kobeden were very flavorful and juicy. Also the soup was amazing. Wish they had hot Persian bread not pita bread."}
{"text":"I'm from the US and every time I've visited my cousins in Canada we've ate at Tehran. Over the years the prices have risen but the service has declined dramatically.

The food quality is still pretty good, the Barg is very tender and tasty. The koobideh is pretty good as well. Both types of chicken kabab are also good. The rice is good but the tomatoes are a little undercooked.

The main problem with Tehran is the poor service. The servers are stretched very thin and they had 3 servers for the whole restaurant. I genuinely felt bad for the servers. I don't know if the owners/management are trying to save a few pennies by paying fewer servers but they'll lose customers this way. They've lost my family's business. 

I truly don't blame the servers, it's not their fault. They are stressed and stretched thin. The owner and management should be ashamed of themselves for putting the servers in this situation. A server told my mom that despite bad reviews they get busier every day. So as long as they get customers the cheap owner will try to use poor service to get himself a few more pennies. Shame on them."}
{"text":"Very spacious restaurant by the Vendome station, great service, their chicken and beef Kopideh is sooo good. The combination of the fluffy long grain rice and roasted tomatoes with the beef and chicken and a salad appetizer is so tasty. The plate is really big and filling for one person, so you might feel like rolling out of the resto after your meal. The mirza appetizer is really good too! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I got the most severe good poisoning from this place a few years back. We had contacted them to let them know and they didn't care. My boyfriend at the time and I were sick for a week from the food we had ordered there. Never eating there again."}
{"text":"I took my Prof here, because he wanted to have Persian food. I hesitated a lot because of the comments, but finally surrendered because it was the closest to his place and I didn't have a car. It was a weekday, and at noon there were quite a lot of people eating there (more than 10 tables taken, while the restaurant is in a residential area). 

Unlike some have mentioned, the staff were quite nice, just that they didn't speak Persian! My Prof asked for Tahdig (fried/carbonized rice from the bottom of the rice casserole), which is not served normally, but they kindly served it for us on the side...

The food was nothing out of ordinary. For one thing the chicken I ordered was rather dry. We also ordered the lamb shank which was OK. The eggplant paste was below ordinary and rather tasteless. I haven't tried other main dishes, though. I give it three stars because I really liked their Salad and their Aash (kind of a thick soup)."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent Kabab Barg. BUT, very poor service! Koobideh was too salty. There was no incident but the waitress completely ignored us. No one even once asked us if we needed something or if everything was OK."}
{"text":"Ok food. Their unrecommended reviews are all bad. They are lucky that the reviews don't show up on top. Would not go back again. Better than Yas restaurant. The staff was a bit too tense and when i made a joke they got soured up a bit. Maybe i should not joke:). The owner kept eating chips behind the counter with fingers in the mouth. Yum! Not too appetizing in my opinion. Definitely not friendly people in the place. Happy smiles would do wonders and are contagious. :) cheers"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was ok.  Tried the kaba koobideh.  It was ok but didnt like the ash soup."}
{"text":"This is one of the oldest Persian restaurants in Montreal and it has stood the test of time. The service is fast. The staff is polite and accommodating. It's a family restaurant that can accommodate large groups great for your christmas party's or any office events .

The food speaks for itself, I have been coming here since I was a child and I can honestly say I have tasted everything on the menu.  The barg (filet mignon) is very tasty and juicy. The crazy chicken is just delicious. Rice has a nice scent to it and is fluffy. Salad is good with tasty dressing. Plates are very generous, price/quality is just great. 

Complimentary tea at the end of your meal which is great. I always leave this place happy and thoroughly satisfied."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the good Iranian restaurants in town. I personally liked the beef Kobideh compared to the chicken. Try crazy chicken if your a chicken lover. It was super juicy with a great flavor. The eggplant stater was pretty good as well. I will definitely come again if I feel like eating Iranian."}
{"text":"Wow great place.   Huge portions very fresh and tasty.  Service was fast if not hugely warm.  We had some much food left I had lunch for two days!"}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on stopping here today, but as I approached Vendome metro I saw a little \"open\" sign flashing in the window and quite a few people enjoying a late lunch, and realized I was starving. What a great, albeit random, pick.
Their mains are all pretty much the same: meat (or eggplant!) with rice, and you start with a lentil soup or a salad. They put the bottle of dressing on your table, thank goodness, because it's delicious. The salad is pretty big, and I was too full to finish my copious plate of \"crazy chicken\" (marinated and charcoal grilled chicken thighs) so I have a full meal for tomorrow's lunch. Looking around me, everyone's plate is empty. Simple, authentic food prepared with love and served with grace by the efficient waitress darting around the room. There's also a shaker full of sumac on the table that I totally ignored because I was too busy enjoying my food, but yeah, I should have sprinkled some of that on everything too.
No complaints at all. It's clean, a little bare bones in terms of decor, and has lovely middle eastern sounding music playing in the background. I was only a little confused by the plate of pita bread served with butter and a half onion... Someone explain this to me please!"}
{"text":"My best restaurant for authentic Persian food in Montreal! Always fresh delicious food. We tried almost every item on the menu and we liked them all."}
{"text":"Please do not write reviews of a restaurant if you have never been to the establishment.  

This was a great place to eat.  Everything was outstanding.  The wait staff was great and the food was wonderful.  I asked if I could take the sumac which was on the table with me.  

After dinner a compulsory baklava and Persian tea just can not be turned down."}
{"text":"Tasty recipes ! Tres bon assaisonement des viandes. Plats servi avec riz basmati et assiete decoré simplement mais bien reussi. Grand place, bcp de tables et grandes fenetres. Le thé est offert par la maison mais pas l'eau ... Lol."}
