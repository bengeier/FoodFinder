{"text":"Very nice new interior. The booths are large and comfy, and we had a great server. 30 once beer specials are thirst quenching, but I wouldnt drive after one. The chickpea soup only had 7 peas, but nice flavour. Burger with bacon and egg added was awesome."}
{"text":"What a great new place!  My turkey burger with salad was honestly one of the best I've had!  And the special treatment for kids meant that we could relax and talk!  Coming back."}
{"text":"I went here with family after visiting Upper Canada Mall. The layout is nice, fresh, new - that's  about the only good thing. The portions are tiny. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, and although it was an appetizer, I expected more than three tablespoons of it. My family ordered a variety of things (full meals) but they too were child portions. Baby food for adult prices. I'm tired of seeing this in restaurants. Sure, we aren't in America and we don't need monstrous portions, but we come here for meals, not for samples. And what's with the \"uniforms\"?. This place looks like Hooter's and Moxie's had a test tube baby. There is a big difference between sexy-classy, and down right trashy (can you guess which one Arthur's is?). It takes the place WAY down in terms of class. Not impressed with this place and won't be going back. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Don't ever book a large group reservation!!! That was my first mistake. The worst dinning experiences I've ever had. Let's start with how long it took just to get a drink to start the evening 1hr no exaggeration. This is partly to do with having one server for a group of 30. Next most of the main courses on the menu not available? They only offer 8 mains options and they ran out of most. I approached the manger who added zero help as he seems to be the problem for not staffing properly or handling the problem appropriately. That's why one star. Stay far away....."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food , seafood linguine and salmon. Martini and Caesar was very good.However the service was slow and we had to ask our 2 waiters when/ if the food was coming soon. Not sure why we had 2 waiters, the second one wasn't aware we had already ordered our food....so it's definitely a good place to go for the food and atmosphere, but not if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Food took for ever...looks like understaffed..food fly's..parking lot is not lot up..the only way to get a drink is at the bar"}
{"text":"They have a great patio for having a beer or wine and the pizza we ordered was delicious prepared just right, thin crust, the wings were the best I've ever had. I recommend this place and will be going back to try their desserts."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow but very kind, friendly and accommodating.  The food selection was small considering the size of the place but there is a huge beverage menu. The food itself was delicious and portion sizes are a good size. We had appetizers plus a small salad fir dinner & it was perfect. I enjoy the Landing's salad with fish tacos which were very good. Great combination of fish with grilled pineapple & jicama slaw. The beef tacos were great as well. Our friends had the artichoke pizza & they said it was the best meal they had in Canada, so they were very pleased. For a relaxed, fun night out, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Love this little location right outside of the Upper Canada Mall entrance #3. Perfect for any occasion, before and after shopping. Breakfast, brunch or for dinner with friends. We visited this location on a Saturday early afternoon before shopping, the waiter which we unfortunately do not remember the name of was great, attentive and sold us the $39 Mimosa (champagne & orange juice) combo very quickly and efficiently. I wanted something light but filling, she recommend the egg benedit with a fruit bowl and I was very impressed. It was delicious and filling. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast combo, came with peameal bacon, bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast. We ended our brunch meal with mango serbet, I believe it's home made. It taste like so. As we left, we recognized the paper on the door mentioning 21+ after 10 p.m. So we'll definitely have to come check this location out for after hours."}
{"text":"A group of 9 of us, including kids went to this place on my sister's recommendation. Weirdest thing is the serving size for apps and mains. Some apps are bigger than some of the mains. My daughter ordered the Brisket Mac & Cheese from the appetizers, which was absolutely excellent, but not big enough to be a meal for an adult. On the other hand, my sister ordered fish tacos from the apps, and got the three biggest fish tacos I've ever seen (she said they were \"good\"). My wife and dad ordered the carbonara from the mains, and it was relatively small. My wife's gluten-free pasta was starchy and heavy. The pork belly that was in the carbonara was cut into cuboids that were way too big. I didn't like the fattiness of the pork belly, especially in such big chunks. My mom and I ordered the chicken pizza, which sounded really flavourful but the cheese overpowered the taste of everything else. My son had the steak from the kids' menu, which was a good value. My sister's husband ordered Moroccan Chicken. He liked it, and it was a big plate. If quantity matters, make sure you ask the staff how much you get in any particular appetizer or main dish. For dessert, we had cheescake (nothing special) and the toffee cake (way too sweet and too salty... not a good dessert)."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a weekday during the first few weeks it opened.   The restaurant is located in the mall but theres a separate entrance.   The service was good but a little slow for a lunch crowd if you have to get back to work. The food was just 'okay' - it wasn't terrible but nothing to rave about. But given it was during their opening month, I would go back for another try.   I had a turkey burger with coleslaw and a salad which tasted bland and uninspiring."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and it was a great experience. We only ordered a series of appetizers because we wanted to try a lot of things. The apps were great though nothing on the dinner menu appealed to us at first glance. Every app was seasoned well, delicious and worth the money we paid. They were a little pricey for the portion size but the taste made up for it and made us want to order more. Our waitress was amazing as we kept ordering and ordering she served us with a smile. I know that style of ordering can be annoying because she has to keep coming back to us and do basically double the work than a regular table so I was really appreciative of her patience and pleasant attitude. She recommended the sticky pudding as a dessert which was excellent and original. The spice in the sauce was a huge thumbs up from me and will bring me back. Though I don't approve of the staff \"uniforms\" as I find them degrading to women and quite frankly very old school, our experience was great. I spent over 100 bucks on apps that night and loved every minute of it. That waitress deserves a raise and when it comes down to it, along with the great food she was serving she made our night."}
{"text":"Living close to Newmarket, I've noticed this restaurant while visiting Upper Canada Mall as it is located right outside of one of the entrances facing Yonge Street. I was curious to see what kind of restaurant it was. A fairly large restaurant with a dining, bar, and patio area with a combination of industrial and wood finishes along with comfortable seating for both small and large parties. I would consider a close competitor for this chain to be JOEY restaurants.    Came here for brunch with my parents on a weekend and we ordered a Landing Breakfast, Steak and Eggs, and the Benedict Peameal from the brunch menu. The service was good, the host and servers were all very accommodating, but the food took a little longer than I had expected since there weren't too many people the day I went. The Landing Breakfast consisted of two free-run eggs cooked the way you like it, crispy bacon, peameal bacon, hash brown potatoes, buttered multi-grain toast, and house-made jam (Strawberry). the Steak and Eggs were the same with the addition of a 4 oz steak for a price difference of 3 dollars. The Benedict Peameal was plated with peameal bacon, two poached free-run eggs, english muffin, and hollandaise sauce with a side of the landing salad which was delicious. The salad was made with aged cheddar, apple, grapes, spiced sunflower seeds, and blue agave vinaigrette. The combination of all those ingredients made a very light and tasty salad. It's a nice touch, something different than your usual greek or caesar salad on the side. The poached eggs for my eggs benedict were cooked to perfection, with the yolk oozing out when i cut into it. The english muffin was toasted nice and crunchy as well. The prices of the menu items were fairly priced in comparison to other breakfast and lunch places like Cora's and the Sunset Grill.  The Landing Group definitely chose a good location for the restaurant as it is so accessible to shoppers and it's hard to miss such a beautifully decorated place. I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu and might just come back for the Landing Salad cause it was that good."}
{"text":"Came to visit this restaurant for the first time today and we weren't really impressed with the service.  Coming from working in the restaurant industry, there were many opportunities they lacked.  * server #1 took drink order promptly and returned within a reasonable time, but never came back to take food order for another 15 -20 min.  * different server #2 finally came and took our order, but unprofessionally sat down at the table w/ us while she wrote our order in  *appetizer took about 40 mins to arrive to table - no one came back between to ask us for drink refills  *entrees took another 30 minutes - finally asked someone for more drinks  Here is what was ordered from my group:  - ordered a naan chicken club: looked great, tasted OK, but chicken over done and dry  -ordered a classic burger: looked great, taste not bad, but beef patty was over done, dry and fell apart out of bun half way through meal  - mine actually took about 1.5 hours to receive (I had the steak frites; asked well done & no wine sauce glaze as I am pregnant. As well, no salt on fries.   Before the kitchen server placed my olate down, the order taker noticed that sauce was placed all over my steak and immediately took back- which koodos for her noticing before I made a comment - however, took another 10-15 mins to get meal.   She gave me my fries first to eat on a small side plate (the one where you would share an appetizer), but the portion was much smaller than what was on the plate and the original fries they did put salt on it when I asked for none  My group had finished their meal before my steak came back out and was served to me on a side plate- it looked pathetic b/c my meal was served to me in portions.  The order taker/server proceeds and was very apologetic, however made the comment that they are backed up in the kitchen and don't read orders correctly- Oh Great.  Taste was alright, but honestly Not a 1.5+ wait for my meal to eat.  Had another different server #3 come to clear our table and ask if we wanted dessert  Server #4 came to see if we wanted anything else and said they would get our bill which we asked for seperate  Server #5 - who might be a manager came to confirm we wanted bill and said you wanted it all on same bill correct? - Wrong.  So, overall Server #2 never came back to our table. We got served by 5 different servers and were never introduced to any. They were not tag teaming sections; they just simply had no idea what was going on. No apology for long wait times at all and no offer or complemrntary discount on the steak error - I understand this isn't a standard practice, but it could have been a coutesy gesture especially how long we waited  Restaurant was relatively steady but not PACKED for a Sat. Evening.   We understand they are new in town, but sorry- food wasnt THAT great to wait over 1.5+ to get a meal and bad service.  Positives: - nice spactious seating , lots of seating esp outdoors - nice decor - nice patio - large bar area  Will I come back again? - yes in a few months to see if they have improved service, but if it is same situation as before, will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great food. Awfully busy and loud on evenings/at dinner. Good lunch spot, especially on weekdays, though."}
{"text":"Food is very delicious and they're opened late on weeknights so thats a plus :) Server's are also very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice since it opened. The first time was on a Thursday night for my book club. We were seated in a nice corner booth in the bar area. It just happened to be National Wine Day and of course we shared a bottle of wine. I had the potato and leek soup and the Naan Chicken Club Sandwich. Both of these dishes were very good. We ended our dinner by sharing a sticky toffee pudding which is one of the best desserts I've had anywhere. The service was great. The second time was on a Saturday afternoon. My friend and I shared a plate of nachos - they were some of the best that I've ever had. There was lots of cheese, the cajun chicken was nice (sliced rather than chunks or crumbled up in a sauce). The jalapeno crema was a nice hint of spice. I had a margherita pizza for lunch which was okay - lots of cheese but the tomato was a bit soggy. Again, I had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert but it was just okay this time - it was a bit burned on the underside. Our service was decent except that we had to ask for water 3 times. I would definitely return to this restaurant - it's a great location, especially after a busy day of shopping or running errands. The decor is nice and the seating is ample both in the bar and the dining room areas."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a less then 1 star I would! I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad that's $15 without meat. I don't eat meat so thought this was good alternative. I ordered it as take out and when I got it I notice how light the bag was. After opening it I realized that it was smaller then a side salad. It would eat this salad in about 2 1/2 bites. Maybe a small handful of lettuce, 2 small slices of beets and a tsp of goat cheese. The dressing was half full (because they recognize it wouldn't take much to dress a salad of this size). The manager argued with me and said that if I added meat they increase the amount of salad you get on top of the meat ($22 later)  I will never go here again and I now know why people say it's so terrible. Worst service ever, it's sad because I feel like he salad would have been good if they had given me an entree salad size like I expected off the dinner salad entree menu."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of restaurants and so has my partner. We were very excited to try Arthur's Landing and were greeted when we walked in. The host informed us that if we did not want the only table available we would have to wait. At this point we looked around the restaurant which was completely empty and was pondering why would we have to wait for a table when all of them were almost available. We decided to take the first table available and sat down and were greeted by our server within a couple minutes. One sad thing that we quickly noticed was that they do not serve Coke but they do serve Pepsi. My partner was not pleased as Pepsi is not a common restaurant pairing. After placing our order we asked if there was any bread that would be coming to the table. The server looked at us and said there was bread that we could order but it comes in two slices and is very small. We declined and waited for our meal. After receiving our food we noticed that the plate was huge but the portion size was Tiny. The rim on the plate was bigger than the portion size which is weird because we ordered pasta which typically comes larger in most restaurants. We both quickly finished the small bowl of pasta Amore left very hungry. The server did not seem pleased to have us there and we will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yeah, I lost interest. I stopped in for dinner and spent a while perusing the menu for something I might like. The only thing I could decide on from the short menu was the Steak Frites.  The 8 oz \"mystery cut\" was cooked a perfect medium rare, but I could not identify the cut of meat. It was, however, an unexpected aerobic workout for my jaws.  Fortunately they provided a sharp steak knife.   It could have done with some salt (there were no condiments on the table), and done without the red sauce that would fool the squeamish that it was blue rare. Really, it could have just done with some flavour...  Keeps going downhill. Latest experience was bad on all fronts: food quality, speed, and service."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, but I think I like this Landing just opened not long ago right outside of Upper Canada Mall.  The setting and design is almost the same as other Landings.  The spacious and bright patio is definitely a plus even though it is just facing the mall's parking lot.  The service was friendly and attentive.  More importantly, they made very good sangria.  Yes, we ordered a pitcher of white sangria for just two of us.  We ordered fish tacos.  The ingredients used including pineapple made a good match.  We also ordered a beef nacho.  It was one of the best I have ever had.   The nachos were nicely layered with both cheddar and mozzarella cheese but the nachos were still crispy.  A must-try nachos.  Although the waitress brought us the wrong sangria and it took us a bit longer for the right order to come.  The waitress took care of it very politely and quickly.  I will come back to try their bunch under the sun again!"}
{"text":"I loved my pasta dish and the sticky toffee pudding was great. Thanks Sasha for your excellent service!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was not busy whatsoever, maybe only a handful of tables when we arrived. The service to seat us was slow. The service to order was slow. The food came out slow. Cash and getting change was so slow that I had forgotten about getting change! Very inefficient and waitress can't multi-task!   The food tasted bad! I had a burger with fries and gravy and the burger was so dry that I had to add the ketchup from my fries to it. The bun was a bit greasy and the inside was a bit dry on the inside. Burger was no juicy. The fries were limp and warm and the gravy was full of lumps. Harvey's is 10x better!   I came for a friends birthday, but I would not come back! It was terrible, especially the food!"}
{"text":"I had the sausage pizza and a few beers and it was fantastic. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere and lots of tvs to watch the jays game. There is a HUGE patio for when it gets a little warmer so I will defiantly come back.  As for the beer there are a few craft options bust mostly Molson products."}
{"text":"Nice decor. A bit pricey. Clean environment. Friendly service. High quality ingredients. Fresh.  Dessert choices few."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that Arthur's Landing was finally opened in Newmarket!   We sat on the patio on a very hot (spring) day and it was absolutely beautiful. The mall had just closed and the parking lot was starting to empty out.  I loved the spatious patio with a variety of bar seats and booths.  We ordered a pitcher of the white sangria ($36) and it was absolutely delicious. It had hints of peach flavor.  For our appetizer we shared the brisket poutine. There was plenty of tender brisket... (equal parts fries to brisket!).. now there's no such thing as too much meat.. but I would've loved a little more fries to soak up the gravy!  For my main I ordered the tuna tartare tataki salad. It was a delicious combination and the tuna was very fresh.  I also ordered the sticky toffee pudding (with chili salted caramel) for dessert. It was absolutely divine but the chili flavor started to come out after a few bites and I didn't like that. Would prefer this dish without the chili!  Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Sasha was an awesome server. We had a pretty large party and she stayed on top of everybody's order. She even remembered everyone's name. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Visited tonight for a quick bite and drink with a girlfriend.   Service was relatively fast and prices were decent. BFF ordered the margherita pizza and I had the ceasar salad with steak and a Chicago IPA. Hadn't tried the beer before so the server offered a free sample which was a sweet touch. Pizza was a solid 7/10 and ceasar salad was probably a 7.5/10. Homemade dressing would have been better if it were a tad spicier with more of a powerful garlic taste. The steak was thebomb.com. Loved it. I figured they'd give me a flank steak cut up into little slivers but it came out in a steak, like a 4oz solid piece of meat. Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.   I'll be back to try their steak again!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant situated outside Upper Canada Mall. Good menu selection of food. Our waitress was nice . Unfortunately the wait time for food was very long and the restaurant wasn't busy. We were a group of 8, having split bills. Good job I checked my bill I was overcharged on one of the items. They adjusted the bill. Just not feeling it for this restaurant. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I would have to say I wasn't so impressed. The restaurant itself if very nice and modern. But the service on the other hand was horrible. Never checked up on us. Never filled our waters, food took a very long time and all we had ordered was salad! The avocado in my salad was completely brown!! Which is unacceptable. And my salad had little to no dressing on it. And once we were done eating I had to ask 2 different servers for the bill. It was not until 20 minutes later we had received them and then our waitress never came back with the machine for another 10 minutes! She seemed all over the place and in a rush the entire time. I was dying of thirst my entire meal and no one seemed to care to come see how we were doing. I had talked to a relative recently and said they had the same experience. The food was good compared to the service, but still nothing special. And I would never commute to come here again."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food, there was no communication from the waiter, when our food did come out the order wasn't right and it was not even good. The manger was not apologetic and i would not go back. save your time and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I came here for the Friends and Family event this past weekend, I must say I have been excited that a Landing finally came to Newmarket.   Now since I am usually down by Shops on Don Mills my go Landing would obviously be Taylors (which if you see my previous reviews the quality has gone down significantly) However I am really enthusiastic that Arthur's Landing is here in the town that I live in.  As you see in the photos I had posted there were options to try for the set menu. As per usual, I have the Steak Frites - There was nothing to complain about regarding this dish it was absolutely delicious. Medium rare It was cooked to perfection and the frites were soo addictive I couldn't stop myself.  It definitely satisfied the craving I had for steak. My family had tried some of the other dishes in which they really enjoyed - Curried Chicken, The Landing Burger + Fries and the Turkey burger with sweet potato fries.   We started with the Calamari as a appetizer and we all know - you can't really go wrong with a calamari dish! We ended the night with their sticky toffee pudding - it can definitely satisfy any sweet tooth!.   I can not wait to try some of the items that were not on the set menu. Example - Pan Seared Scallops --- OH HELL YES! This will be the FIRST thing I order. I also appreciate that they had created cocktails that reflect the area in which they are in ie. Fairy Lake Sparkle.  Congratulations on your establishment !"}
{"text":"poor service, overpriced, small portions, burnt and cold food"}
{"text":"Wow  so being on a bit of a health hick I was interested in checking out this place for salad .... never tasted such a wonderful healthy salad  amazing service and table checks ! I'm in the industry as well and I'm more then happy to come eat her on days off"}
{"text":"The Landing chain has arrived in the Newmarket area and it's about time!  What a welcome change that I know the area will embrace. The layout is similar to the other Landing locations with the bar area having roll up doors which open to the massive patio.   It's not hard to find as it is attached to the Upper Canada Mall. Bright and open is what you will find as you enter. Greeted by friendly hostesses you are seated to your table and promptly greeted by your server.   Food is made to order and freshly prepared.  Tuna tataki salad was delicious with a little kick and was highly recommended by our server. Beet and goat cheese salad was also freshly made and filling. The chicken and waffles...senses triggered immediately are the warm soft sweet waffles, crispy savoury chicken tenders, salty bacon white gravy and topped with a maple sherry glaze.   Great experience typical of the Landing chain."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment in Newmarket two times, once for lunch and most recently for Brunch and on both occasions unfortunately the service was very poor.  We had to wait half hour to even order a drink. Then once we finally could order, we attempted ordering one of their famous brunch items which is Chicken and Waffles however unfortunately their waffle maker didn't work.  I found it odd as this restaurant is in a mall and would have been a quick fix to improvise and for them to purchase some replacement waffle makers.  Breakfast was ok.  We ordered the smoke brisket Mac and cheese and it was a tiny portion and pasta was pasty.  The brisket though was very good however basically I slice on it.  The ambience and decor is 5* so if they get their service and food improved, then it would become a great place to eat."}
