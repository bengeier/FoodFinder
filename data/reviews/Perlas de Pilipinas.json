{"text":"Service: been here multiple times for lunch. The girl (who seems like the owner) at the counter has always been very friendly and helpful with a smile!

Food: I've had their special Garlic Rice with Chicken Leg - full of flavours, loved it! Beef Caldereta combo from their hot food counter with rice and a drink - good in taste, but the temperature wasn't warmed up enough, a bit at room temperature, and I prefer my food hotter than that, and Tapsilog - I haven't tried this classic Filipino dish anywhere else, but it's great in terms of taste for my buds!

Overall: it's become one of my go-to lunch spot!"}

{"text":"I frequent this place as it near my work.  Authentic filipino breakfast with no frills. Pearl is very attentive and accommodating. Their 4.99 breakfast is a bomb. It comes with bread, hash brown, 2 eggs cook how you like it, coffee or tea , fruit of the day and a choice of sausage or ham or bacon. I have tried their other dishes and I have no regrets. Its a breathe of fresh cuisine near my area. 
Note: they roast their own lechon and cant wait to try other dishes."}
