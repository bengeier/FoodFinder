{"text":"DE LOIN le meilleur indien à Montréal! FAn de bouffe indienne et épicée, essayer les alloo tikki et la soupe au lentille sans oublié le délicieux poulet au beurre!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant! I've been a regular for the past 7 years and never had anything to complain about.  Food is great,  prices are good!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. Their butter chicken is so flavourful. Samosas are amazing: crunchy and spicy. Each of their dishes has that perfect combination of spices, not too overwhelming unlike most other Indian restaurants. Their meat dishes are juicy and tender.   The atmosphere is comfortable and the service is very friendly.   MUST TRY for authentic, flavourful Indian food!"}
{"text":"The best part of Malhi is it is cheap - a dinner for 2 will cost you CAD30 which is real cheap. But you get what you pay for. The food is not great- I cook better at home. The attitude of the main guy who could be the owner is obnoxious. He yelled at us for keeping on ordering food. They can't handle big groups - we were 12 and our order for 2 came almost after everyone had finished dinner. They outright ask for cash so they will not charge you taxes which is wrong. I will let a Govt official investigate that. They were literally begging for cash (especially USD). Never order the Gulab Jamun- just go to an Indian grocery store - they taste better. I will not be back to the place and will never recommend it. I tasted Chicken Jalfrezi and Lamb Masala - the gravy is the same. If you want quality Indian Food in Montreal please eat at Le Taj - it's way more expensive but you get your money's worth. The only reason Malhi is in business that long is because it is cheap."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I was invited to try Malhi. Before then, I was not a big fan of Indian dining. Little did I know, my experience with Indian cuisine at Malhi's would change everything forever after... Malhi is truly exceptional. I have tried multiple dishes on their menu and each has seized my taste buds in a very special and flavourful fashion. Always serving amazingness in a bowl (most of their main dishes are served in a bowl), you won't be disappointed. The various flavours and spices will tantalize you. Shortly after leaving this place, you will want to return for all the goodness they have to offer.  My recommendations: the vegetable pakoras as an appetizer, chicken tikka masala with rice and naan bread, and finish off your meal with gulab jamun for dessert. If you live far from Park Ex., it is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"it is the best in montreal (to my taste).. been going there for at least 15 years , and Mahli was always up to par...i really like the butter chicken , as it does not taste only like tomatoes.. the eggplant are my spouse favorites, channa samosa plate is so tasty..."}
{"text":"The tightly packed and gloomy setting of the rather pricey Golden Restaurant on rue St. Laurent was my favorite Indian restaurant until I was told about Sweet Malhi.  My taste buds were immediately overwhelmed with flavor and aroma of their delicious entrees and main dishes, their Naan bread was most excellent!  Don't let the attitude of the waiter bother you, he probably works for a low salary. Bright atmosphere and the Taj Mahal beer on tap...yummmm!  This is the real deal for amazing and inexpensive Indian food in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cuisine indienne maison excellente... la cuisine elle-même est pratiquement dans la salle à manger ! Très peu coûteux. Par contre, le décor est minimal et surtout, les néons pourrait être changés pour qqch. de moins agressant."}
{"text":"La cuisine indienne n'a rien d'une cuisine gastronomique, mais les plats de chez Mahli Sweets sont tellement savoureux qu'on y retourne pour y manger du bon poulet au beurre et des pains nan. L'endroit est décoré de façon bien minimaliste, mais y manger est bien agréable. Beaucoup de clients prennent leur repas pour emporter, mais sur place les nan sont bien meilleurs! On y retourne? Pour faire un \"change-up\" pendant le temps des fêtes, il n'y a rien de mieux. Mais à tout autre moment de l'année aussi!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Mahli since 2006 and for the life of me, I do not know why it took me so long to write up a review on this delicious restaurant.  Mahli Sweets is not your \"wanna be Indian Restaurant\" it is THE benchmark of Indian cuisine.  And by this I have taken the liberty to say, without having seen other kitchen's, that this one is the most varied, complex and cleanest, that I know of, within this price range.  My typical order consists of 1/2 lb of Pakoras (you can also get 1 lb if you want to), with Lamb Curry and white rice.  If I want to spice things up a bit, literally, I ask for the Byrianni rice.  So much flavor in such a \"simple looking\" dish.  But do not be fooled, there is nothing simple about Indian cuisine. If anything, it is probably the most labor intensive cuisine out there and the people who make tasty dishes should earn much more for their skills.    The decor, which was very rustic and \"typical\" to many Indian restaurants has had 2 facelifts in the past year or so.  The owner has managed to keep the prices low and food quality very good, yet he also did some significant upgrades with the last 6 months to give it a more \"sophisticated\" look.   One cannot also ignore the Bollywood films playing on the big screen TV's that are located at the front and back of the restaurant.  The good thing about that is that it's not in your face nor is it loud.  If you want to \"Watch\" you can, but it is not invasive by any means and you can carry on with a normal pitch conversation.  I have taken many of my friends to this restaurant and all of them left with their stomachs full of good food and have been repeat customers.  A word of advice, if you want to have a good spot for more than 4 people, arrive early or even better, place an order.  These guys are quick to get your food out and the best part is that the food is fresh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite indian restaurent in town, the ambiance is not very nice, but the food is very tasty and cheap!"}
{"text":"Effectivement, c'est le meilleur resto indien sur Montréal! Rapport qualité/prix il n'y a rien a dire!!! On mange à chaque fois comme 4 et on s'en sort pour moins de 15$/personne!!! Mon favori dans ce resto: les allo tikki!! Oui c'est une entrée mais c'est surtout un mélange de saveurs... Coriandre, menthe, oignons, tomates, crème, pois chiche.... Vous ne le regretterez pas! Ne vous arrêtez pas à la déco du restaurant. C'est en général dans les petits boui boui comme celui là qu'on est le plus surpris!  Les gérants sont sympas et j'aime également le côté cosmopolitain de ce resto: francophone, anglophone, latino, indien, etc.... Tout le monde apprécie!"}
{"text":"Some people said the staff weren't friendly. I found them very nice and fast. All appetizers were very good. The goat curry is a must! I love butter chicken but this one was just ok. Many reviews mention that the chicken is dry and it's very true. They need to switch from breast to dark meat.  Basmati rice & nan bread were excellent. While eating cuisine, try the Indian beer it's quite good. I will return but skip the butter chicken. As for my favorite Indian restaurant, I'm still searching..."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of fellow food lovers.  The place was fairly full on a Thursday evening, but a table for 8 was available.   We decided to each order a different dish, and try a bit of everything.  The chicken tikka was great - the chicken was tender and flavourful and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  The saag paneer, a spinach dish with paneer cheese, was delicious - fresh pieces of ginger gave it a nice bite.  We also had the goat curry.  The goat was tender and moist.  We mopped up the delicious sauces with fresh buttery naan bread or let it soak into the well cooked basmati rice.      Service was friendly and efficient, and the staff has a good sense of humour."}
{"text":"Great spot in park extension. Spot is good and spicy just the way I like. The waiter is very professional and efficient. It is clean, bathroom everything I ve seen.  Priced not too high. There are cheaper thalis out there just as good.  Recommended."}
{"text":"It ain't all that, y'all. First time I found the good rather greasy and westernized. Second time biryani was undercooked and not impressively spiced. The mango lassi and raita were very good tho! No sweets! Misnomer there..."}
{"text":"We love this place, been sporadically coming for at least 7 years, and always wonder why I'm not here more often.  Samosas: best I had in Mtl.  Naan bread: yup! We shall be back for this alone.  Butter chicken: top 5 in Montreal  Madras Beef Curry: 8.9/10 tender beef. Just the right amount of coriander and cumin. Delight.  Shrimps + rice: very good taste, however never liked the small shrimps. Abort. 3.5/10. Give us the tiger shrimps and this dish is a 9/10  Beers: Taj Mahal and Cobra.  Dish presentation: 8.5/10  We shall be back, soon!  The place is clean as well, or at least looks like it."}
{"text":"Bonne sélection de mets indiens, prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"Très bon et pris raisonnable pour des quantités correct. J'aurais préféré des cubes d'agneaux plus gros ou plus nombreux."}
{"text":"Excellent quality Punjabi-style Indian food near Montreal. It's an easy drive from the main city center and worth it!  The Vegetable Korma and Channa Masala were perfectly spicy and the naans were soft and delicious. Get the salty lassi (yogurt drink) to calm your mouth if it's on fire.   Well worth the time, money, and calories!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in town. It's not a fancy place but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Having been exposed to Indian cuisine my entire life and on numerous continents I am always on a quest to find that authentic Indian restaurant experience here in Montreal.  Recently my search led me to Malhi Sweets.   I found the decor to be bright and refreshing as opposed to dim and dingy like a few resto's in the area but that being said, environment was never really at the top of my expectation list. I know that sometimes the best of ethnic foods can be found in establishments that won't win any awards for choice of wallpaper or quality of the chairs.  While Indian cuisine is so much more than just \"butter chicken\"- it is usually the reference point of comparison for the restaurants I try, as I take it to be one of the more popular dishes and a staple to many patrons. This one was disappointing. The sauce was not nearly as rich and flavoursome as one or two others I have tried and worst of all the chicken was extremely dry.   I was quite surprised that the Thali did not come with rice so we had to order rice after our Thali's had been placed in front of us, but to their credit it did arrive soon after. Unfortunately the rice was not the light and fluffy aromatic basmati that you usually expect from Indians but was more dense and still slightly \"wet\"- perhaps a couple of more minutes in the cooker would have done the trick.  The service was a bit disjointed and haphazard but good food always compensates for that. When it comes to service, I don't come down hard on \"mom and pop\" establishments that are reasonably priced. Yes it would be nice to make sure we have knives and forks before the food arrives but as long as I can get your attention within a couple of minutes, we're good.  The quest continues and it seems most Montrealers aren't too discerning when it comes to Indian food but for those with a more discriminating and experienced Indian palate Malhi sweets certainly doesn't rank at the top of the list.  Lastly, if you're going to charge me GST and PST when I am paying cash, don't try to get away with not putting it through the register. It is one thing to avoid paying income tax to the thieves in Government but it's another to take an extra 15% from the patron with no intention of passing it on to The Man. Demand your receipts.  Don't take my word for it- give it a try and tell us what you think!"}
{"text":"It's a little walk from any subway station but who doesn't enjoy an evening stroll in the freezing Montreal cold!? Small inside, you might have to wait a bit before being seated and this even on a week night (prooving that I am not the only one enjoying an evening walk!). We opted for the thalis, vegetarian and lamb (tip: rice is not included so you will need to order it as well and pay it above the thalis price). The food was bland, lacking in quality and clearly reheated (if heated at all) and the host was just looking annoyed to be there and almost throwing our food on the table. Fortunately, the other staffs were more pleasant and attentive. Overall, it's more pricey and less good than other options in the area so next time I will take my evening stroll in another direction..."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place is excellent. The food is super tasty, service great, and the restaurant is consistent. Every time I go, I expect my meal to be as good as the last time, and they never disappoint.  Highly recommended for Indian food lovers."}
{"text":"First off, who cares Catherine Deneuve and Leelee Sobieski came here? Well I guess the owners still do. I'm pretty sure restaurants power to attract new diners is based on their food and not their past glory days... I have come here 3 times now and twice my girlfriend has come home vomiting her food, not because of a disease but because (I guess) how bad the food is? Only place she's ever reacted to so badly, and she has no problem with Pushap! or even KFC!  I've read a lot of reviews on here and agree that the host is too present and mute (?), staring at me while we eat or watching the 2 (!!) TVs that try to pass as atmosphere with Bollywood movies playing...very distracting. I came out feeling like I had spent 40$ for an indian variation on a Subway restaurant, from the chairs, tables, the TVs, and the impossibility of finding a warm corner to sit away from the winter cold from the front door, to the back door where cooks kept carrying out buckets full of their prepared food, down to a basement? Who knows? All I kept thinking was that this is another example of a \"Kitchen Nightmare\" where a quick look at their kitchen and refrigerators would make you throw up like my girlfriend. Atmosphere is a 1/10 Food is a 3/10 Price is a 4/10 Past glory days pictures are a 6/10 (for laughs)"}
{"text":"Sachez que le nom de l'endroit est plutôt \"historique\"... avec quelque chose comme \"Malhi Sweets\" on pense tout de suite à c'est endroits qui vendent une panoplie de petite bouchée sucré indienne... cela étais le cas peut-être il y a plus d'une décade mais ce n'est plus le cas aujourd'hui... pas de dessert ici!  En revanche, c'est un restaurant indien qui offre une cuisine indienne de bonne qualité, peut-être une des meilleure table du genre à Montréal. Par contre, il ne faut pas être pressé pour manger ici. Le service est lent et peu attentif. Le serveur (propriétaire?) s'occupe du service aux tables, des commandes pour apporter et de répondre au téléphone pour noter les livraison... donc, soyez patient..."}
{"text":"Pas le meilleur, pas le pire non plus! C'est bon, mais pour moi y manque le petit plus. Le service etait meilleur que la premiere fois que j'y suis alle il y a 4 ans.   J'ai trouvé ca cher pour un ptit resto indien. Les plats sont au moins 2$ plus cher qu'ailleurs.   A vous de juger!"}
{"text":"J'ai été mangé là aujourd'hui, et le décor a été refait complètement.  Très content, ça ressemble beucoup plus à un restaurant.  Bravo, et la bouffe toujours la meilleure."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite indian restaurants. The cuisine is authentic and the service really fast. Also, this is pretty cheap! :) (for example: 2 samosas = 1, 50$ = Yeah!!!;) ) The restaurant isn't fancy or anything, so feel free to dress casual! Bon Appétit!!"}
{"text":"Malhi Sweets is a few blocks from the north west corner of Jarry Park, seats approx 20 on super clean simple wooden tables and chairs by wide windows. It's not fancy: some Indian art and TV's broadcasting hot Bollywood music videos at a pretty mellow decibel, lots of framed clippings of great reviews and celebrity guests. There's an attentive staff and diverse clientele and everyone is smiling. Today we started with the Aloo Tikki and Malhi Special rolls, both crispy but light and we loaded them with lots of yummy, spicy sauces. I had Aloo ghobi (crazy delicious cauliflower and potatoes) Shahi Paneer (amazing soft homemade cheese in a creamy, tomatoey, Indian spicy sauce) the man had the Goat Curry and declared it his new favourite food. We shared nan - thin, soft, hot, lightly buttery - perfect. We drank frothy sweet lassi's and an Indian beer called Taj Mahal on tap - light refreshing lager that goes great with curry, and they have some other local and Indian mircobrews I'd go back to try. When we could eat no longer we loaded up the to-go tray's, paid our 46$ bill (nice!) and walked off into the sunset."}
{"text":"Manger au resto indien relève plus d'une expérience culinaire que d'autres choses. Ne vous attendez pas à voir un décor somptueux ni à un service impeccable et rapide! Et Mahli Sweets est un resto indien bien typique pour cela.   Nous étions un groupe de 8 pour un anniversaire. Nous sommes arrivés vers 18h00 et sommes sortis passé 20h30! Donc, si vous êtes nombreux, soyez patient! Il faut dire que le resto était bondé et qu'il n'y avait qu'un seul serveur pour assurer les livraisons, les commandes pour emporter et la salle! Ouf!  Nous avons commencé par partager une livre de pakora aux légumes. Accompagnés de sauce au tamarin et d'une sauce épicée, c'était un bon début. Les pappadums étaient bons. Nous avons partagé différents plats: saag paneer, biryani à l'agneau, agneau karma et poulet tandoori. Le tout accompagné de pain naan, de riz et d'une bière en fût Le Taj Mahal. Le saag paneer était très épais, je l'aime plus crémeux. Ça goûtait les épinards surgelés. Le biryani était correct, ainsi que le l'agneau korma. Le poulet tandoori était bon mais un peu trop salé. La bière était bonne, une bonne bière blonde indienne qui se marie bien aux plats épicés. Nous avons terminé par un masala chaï, un peu épais et fait rapidement avec un mélange d'épice. Pas le meilleur, disons. Les gulab jamuns étaient bons et bien sucrés.   Dans l'ensemble, c'était correct. Les prix sont raisonnables. Et nous avons passé un bon moment en famille!"}
{"text":"Last night I was waiting in the car for my husband to grab our take-out order from Malhi Sweets when I suddenly realized that I had yet to leave a review for our favorite Indian restaurant.  Yesterday we attended a holiday party and then a baby shower immediately following. As we left the second party at around 5:30 PM yesterday evening and not having the energy to make dinner, I turned to my husband and gently suggested, \"let's grab Indian on our way home for dinner, honey, what do you say?\" He nodded, smiled and without skipping a beat he said, \"oh yeah... I could really go for some good Indian. What a great idea!\" A few years ago after deciding to go out to eat Indian food we would have then discussed which of the many Indian restaurants on Jean-Talon or rue Jarry should we try; but now when we say \"Indian\" we are both referring to Malhi Sweets. Once we discovered Mahli Sweets we came to the conclusion that it was not worth wasting our time and money trying other restaurants when we know that Malhi is wonderful. Now the only discussion is whether we should eat at the restaurant or get our food to go. The naan is so delicious it simply melts in your mouth. The saag paneer is fabulous and we almost always order the butter chicken because it is full of flavor but not too spicy (our 4 year-old is not a fan of overly spicy food). Best of all, it is not expensive. We leave with enough food for 4 adults for about $45, including tax and tip.  Incidentally, we are hosting a party next month and we have asked Mahli Sweets to make 50 samosas for our party. They are going to be a hit with our friends! Mahli Sweets' samosas are some of the best we have ever had anywhere!"}
{"text":"This is a small family Indian restaurant near Acadie/Jarry. I've been here for so many years now. Parking is not too difficult within a 5 minutes walk from the restaurant.   I am always greeted by the same man, which I believe is the owner of the restaurant. Their food, for the quality/price ratio is quite good! It's a very simple decorated restaurant, with Bollywood music in the background (on TVs). I've brought a few friends here and everyone liked it !   Please note that they take Visa, but not Mastercard."}
{"text":"First and foremost: Ignore the exterior of this place. It looks like a dump from outside and immediately conjures images of a low-rent, dirty interior that is the opposite of the truth. Inside the place is remarkably pretty, well-lit and thoroughly enjoyable.   The food is traditional northern Indian fare for the most part and done well. The sauces are slightly less complex than the best I've had (thus the lack of one star) but for the Montreal Indian scene, this is near the top of the class. Service isn't what you'd call friendly but it's competent and quick and there is clearly a serious commitment to quality at every step of the food creation process.   We had: Incredibly fresh, fantastic samosas, shahai paneer (medium), butter chicken (death spicy by request), mango lassi and fantastic garlic naan.   Will return."}
{"text":"Le Malhi est LE meilleur resto indien de Montréal. Oui, je commence fort, mais j'assume. Chacune de mes visites ici a été une expérience culinaire indienne digne de ce nom. Depuis les récentes rénovations, l'endroit à prit un coup de jeunesse, ce qui en fait maintenant un resto plus agréable à visiter. Le service est toujours aussi... disons... neutre? (je n'ai jamais vu sourire le serveur ou le patron) mais la bouffe est toujours aussi grandiose.   La beauté de la cuisine indienne, c'est de choisir plein de petits plats qui vont remplir la table. Chaque personne pigne et mange ce qui lui tente. Vous comprendrez, ça vaut le coup de venir ici en groupe. Je suggère les Samosas végé en entrées, le poulet Tikka Massala, le riz beriyani, le mélange petit pois et fromage maison (désolé, j'ai oublié le nom), la chèvre (oui, la chèvre !) et le pain naan. Tous succulents.   Je recommande fortement."}
{"text":"I visited this place for my Parantha cravings. I was told that they have all types of stuffed paranthas. However, to my disappointment there were only potato-stuffed ones. They were well done but overly priced. I am able to get much better priced and tasty ones right in downtown. I also ordered raita and chai. Chai was tasty, however, a tiny-tiny cup of chai costs 3$! I would atleast expect a decent sized cup for tea. Hence, for paranthas and chai I will not go back to this place. The service is good, the place is clean. However, the decor is a little cold.  I do plan to go back for trying other things."}
{"text":"I would normaly put 4 stars, but i put the extra star to increase what it really is.   In my opinion, we don't rate an Indian rate like you rate a French or Italian restaurant and the reason is that service is almost really really shitty. To make sure they won't have to learn the language (to some extension) they'll simply put numbers on their menu to facilitate the way the order is done. I've seen some indian-fusion (with French cuisine) restaurant being quite good at service but it's only because of the French effectiveness background).  This place gives you a real Pundjab (sorry about the spelling) cuisine experience. Family business this place is always packed with locals and indians foreigner which kind of give you a tip: If indian people wants indian food from this restaurant, it must be good!).   So last time i went there, I was with my Friend and meeting his friend, wife and kid. We really had a good time, the service was really quick even if it did felt cold, I didn't take it for granted that I was suppose to feel welcome in a friendly restaurant. It's a family business, which mean, they probably work 6-7 days a week with a crappy salary. So I didn't take it for granted. It's not a huge place but it's really alive. There's a selection of IPA (made from a local brewery) and it is really good. I don't know the names of the stuff I've had there, since my friend knew what was good, he ordered (with his other buddy) for everybody. The apetizer that looks like a chip with a spicy but sweet sauce is awesome, If it would have been a bar, i'd have that with some pint of IPA all night long!   One other thing I think it's important to mention: Damn it's cheap! There's no place in Montreal where i'll have 2 pints of beer, 2 apetizer and 3-4 main plates and a small desert for 25-30$  Fun fact: when you get in, you see the wall is covered with some local celebrity and some international too that came there. If a restaurant can survive more than 30 years, you can bitch about it as much as you want, but it shows that this place works and people eat there."}
{"text":"La nourriture est délicieuse!! J'ai vraiment aimé le boeuf biryani et le poulet au beurre ! Par contre le service est très ordinaire  et la place n'est pas particulièrement belle"}
{"text":"where i'm from, there's a big population of indians and great indian restaurants.  the indian food at malhi is ok compared to the fantastic indian food from sf bay area. maybe for montreal, it's \"the best\" because there isn't a lot of competition around.  so onwards with the food review: - naan (was one of the best naan i've had. definitely giving credit here) - chili chicken (mediocre- tasted like pre-made fried chicken doused with indian spices) - butter chicken (love the sauce, but the chicken breast was really dry)  overall, a mediocre 3 star indian cuisine, but i'd give them a 3.5 just for their really good naan.  we didn't have to wait long for the food to come out - a plus."}
{"text":"Two words:  Catherine Deneuve.  What other Montreal restaurant (of any stripe?) can boast a photograph of Catherine Deneuve (and Leelee Sobieski [?]) on premises, and positively glowing after what was obviously another amazing Malhi Sweets meal?*  Malhi Sweets has been my go-to Indian restaurant for well over 10 years now (even before Ms. Deneuve paid her fateful visit).  It's just wickedly, consistently good, and I've always loved the friendly, no-frills ambience and the grace and charm of the moustachioed owner.    Funny thing is, I was a vegetarian when I started going to Malhi Sweets, and I still tend to order vegetarian every time I go.  Standards include the pakoras, the dal makhni (with 35% cream), the baigan bharta, the channa, the vegetable korma, and the garlic nan.  If only they would bring back the malai kofta, which was my very favorite Malhi Sweets dish of all-time, the one that literally drove me crazy (I literally couldn't rest until every last morsel, every last drop, had been devoured).  Hot tip:  if you ever see a plate of chili pakoras on the front counter, order some!  They're awesome, and I've never seen them anywhere else in Montreal.  * What I want to know is:  who's the genius who insisted that Catherine Deneuve visit Malhi Sweets?  I wish it had been me..."}
{"text":"Mon premier poulet au beurre de ma vie, et une extase culinaire !   Perdu au milieu des nombreux restaurants Indiens de la rue Jarry, on ne penserait pas à rentrer spécialement ici si les avis n'étaient pas si prometteurs...   Le Malhi Sweet promet un service rapide, efficace (bien que pas forcément des plus souriants) et de (très) grosse quantités. Les différents pains naan (épinards, oignons...) sont des merveilles. Les frileux du gras doivent s'abstenir, on ne comptera pas les calories ingurgitées ici !! Mais c'est un régal, hâte d'y retourner."}
{"text":"Birdie Num Num    We went a few months ago with the Yelp gang for a tasting of pretty much everything on the menu.     The Food was well prepared with a very 'home made', authentic feel and not too spicy(I've eaten vindaloo that made me see through time). Service was prompt, polite and the beer was cheap; They stuck the landing.    It's an experience, like eating in a Bollywood movie...but I've yet to have better Indian on the Island.   waka waka"}
{"text":"Cet endroit n'a pas du tout été ce à quoi je m'attendais. Avec tous les avis 5 étoiles, je m'attendais à quelque chose de beaucoup plus chic. Le décor ressemble plutôt a celui d'un resto de quartier qui sert des hamburgers donc c'est plutôt pour la bouffe que cet endroit se mérite tant d'étoiles. Et je ne peux m'empêcher que de leur donner une note parfaite tellement les plats sont savoureux.   Étant avec une amie végétarienne je n'ai pas goûté à ce que je considère comme étant les classiques avec lesquels je compare les autres restos indiens. Par contre les plats qu'on a partagé étaient tellement délicieux qu'on a léché nos plats jusqu'à ce qu'il ne reste plus une seule goûte de cari à l'aide de nos pain naans géants qui fondent dans nos bouches tellement ils sont frais. On a partagé des samosas,  une autre entrée dont j'ignore le nom, trois currys différents er du riz. On était tellement pleines et en plus il en restait pour un lunch pour deux personnes. Et tout ça pour aussi peu que 35$ taxes et tip inclus.  Je suis super contente d'avoir découvert un des meilleurs restos indien de la ville mais je suis triste en même temps parce qu'il est pas mal loin de chez nous. Ça me donnera une excuse de plus pour aller visiter mes amis qui se retrouvent dans ce coin de la ville."}
{"text":"We had a vegetarian thali and a chicken vindaloo for supper. The overall impression was that the meal was way too salty for our taste buds. There was a total of five 1-inch cubes of chicken and 2 pieces of potates in the vindaloo. The dal and the naan in the thali plate were fantastic, but the chaana and the aloo gobi were excessively salty. Thank goodness I had a sweet lassi to save me (my favorite part of the meal). Even my SO's mango lassi tasted like it was made from a mango syrup. For the price we paid, we've had better Indian meals elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Première visite , c'était super ! Nourriture très bonne, les employés sont très accueillants, le propriétaire est présent et très sympathique! Difficile un peu de tout comprendre ce qu'ils disent, mais tout de même très agréable, le propriétaire nous a offert une entrée gratuite a partager en attendant nos amis qui se faisaient attendre ! :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a particularly icy, cold night to meet up with some fellow Yelpers to get our collective Indian on. Despite the somewhat tacky interior and warbling Bollywood on the tv, the place was fairly full and as soon as I opened the door, all I could think of was getting some saag paneer and beer into my gob.  Each one of our 8 people ordered something differed: 2 types of paneer, a yummy cauliflower dish, tikka chicken, some goat and enough naan to feed a small country.   The service was fast and friendly, the beer was cheap and the total bill was ridiculously cheap. I would definitely come back here and I only wish that it was closer to my house. Question though, does he show the Catherine Deneuve photo to everyone that dines here? ha ha"}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine indien. Je connais cet endroit depuis presque 10 ans et je n'ai pas trouvé de meilleur poulet au beurre que celui-ci.  J'ai toujours pris pour emporter, Mais la salle à manger n'est pas très grande. Le service est cependant très rapide, j'attends toujours moins de 10 minutes après ma commande avant qu'elle soit prête.  Les pain nan sont gros et couper en deux, Mais chaque moitié est facilement la grandeur d'un pain dans plusieurs autres restaurant.  Le riz basalmique est cuit à la perfection pour bien se marier avec le poulet au beurre. Jamais déçu à chaque fois que je mange à cet endroit.  Il prenne l'argent comptant, débit ou visa.

Alas I don't think these samosas would ship well Fedex overnight. Well done, honest food in a family-run restaurant."}
