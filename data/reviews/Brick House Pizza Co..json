{"text":"4.5 Stars. Okay. Gonna start this review by saying there that over the holiday, I somehow ended up ordering pizza from here three days straight. Brick House hattrick.  Wasn't intentional, I'm not a pizza addict or a stoner, I just had different guests over each day who were craving pizza. And Brick House is the delicious kind of pizza that you could eat three days straight without getting tired of it. They use fresh, high quality ingredients and if you don't order early enough they might run out - which I like. The crust has that perfect balance of soft chew with thin, charred crispyness. Yum. And orders are finished in 15-20 minutes! The guys are cool and friendly with the right amount no nonsense attitude that comes with knowing you're a pizza master and you yield a far superior product over the processed cheese chain riff raffs. They can also get busy during peak times and take the phone off the hook. No big deal, drive over, place your order and head to the LCBO across the street for a bottle of red.   My preference: The Maui Wowie. Just awesome goodness. Capiola ham, bacon and shaved pineapple? Fuhgeddabouddit. My brother and I inhaled a large in five minutes. (you don't realize how much better shaved pineapple is over the tidbits until you've tried it). You could even switch up the pork for pulled chicken and it's still amazing.  We've had the jerk chicken pizza which is my mum's preference. And the salty swine, which is full of salty prosciutto and olives. The brick breads are very good - I find it just a bit too cheesy for my liking, but as my best friend and my boyfriend have both noted, that is the type of problem you want to have. Hah.  Try em out! It's delicious! It's how pizza should be made."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and their meatball pizza. But I would go there on my lunch break since I work in the plaza but now they don't open til 3pm on weekdays (store hours at the side of page are wrong but I don't know exactly what they are to change them myself)   so ill probably never eat there again. Guy at the store told me they don't make enough money to open that early. Sorry buddy you lost a customer if that's the case. It hurts me more than it hurts you to say this. Please open early again"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Ball Breaker sandwich.  So delicious, you can taste the freshness of the mushrooms, Bocconcini and homemade meatballs.  They use quality ingredients like San Marzano Tomatoes for the sauce.  Will definately go back."}
{"text":"Haven't had really good pizza in awhile, this place is great. Try the sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strip of restaurants and small shops in Streetsville. I am a big fan of woodfired pizza and was told about this place from a new friend of mine.   Upon walking in the door there is just enough room to stand and order your fav pizza, watch it get made and baked in the brick oven right in front of your eyes.   I am a bit picky with my pizza crust. I have had better, but as far as pizza goes, this did the trick to satisfy my pizza craving.   I had the Magnum P.I. Prosciutto, Pineapple & roasted Jalape√±os, with complimentary jalapeno infused olive oil to drizzle overtop. Never having tried prosciutto I found my pizza to be a nice blend of salty, sweet and spicy! Yum!  My favorite thing, however was their signature Brick Bread, like cinnamon buns but made with pizza dough and rolled with a filling of cheese, jalapenos and bacon! So delish!!  I liked that while you waited for your pizza to bake, you could have friendly conversation with the front line guys, they were well 'educated' in the business history and with everything on the menu. Maybe i'm a bit of a pizza snob, so my rating is as high as I could give it, when comparing to other pizza I have tasted but it's definitely a place I would return to to have that amazing Brick Bread!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Streetsville, Meadowvale area. Only problem is its a take-out and they are very busy. Love their potato pizza \"skinner\". The dough is traditional and cooked in a wood fired brick oven and not oily at all. Must try brick bread. The website does not say its a take-out only and also does not indicate they deliver, but they do."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing! Fresh house made ingredients that taste and look great. The char from the wood burning oven was lovely too.   We got the jerk pizza which was actually sweet cause of the roasted pineapple chunks. We also got the garlic and cheese brick bread which is the best thing I've ever eaten!! They don't like it but get their house made chilli oil and creamy garlic sauce too! Sooooooo good!   They are turned me off from all chain pizzas!!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start, this place makes amazing pizza, their brick breads are to die for. Delivery is only within Streetsville but this place is worth the drive. Try the Jerk or the Maui Wowie you will never order from a chain again."}
{"text":"All i can say is BOMB! Glad I found this place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed. Crust probably frozen and tastes awful. One pizza, salty swine, had so many olives that I'm sure an entire olive tree must have been sacrificed. I've eaten excellent Neopolitan brick oven/wood fire pizza around the world...Europe and US. My European wife said it was absolutely the worse she has ever had. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Happy to report that I live in Meadowvale and they delivered to me! They did let me know they don't deliver east of Winston Churchill though. I was very happy with my pizza. I ordered combo 1 - $29.99 for 2 medium 3 topping pizzas. They were both delicious and delivered within 45 minutes. Great selection of toppings and no extra charge for 'premium' toppings like shrimp, like they have at some pizza places. Also NO burnt spots on the crust at all, I can honestly say. Also,  great size on the toppings. I hate how sometimes the toppings are too big, if you know what I mean, and then you can't eat them in one bite and it just makes a mess. I would order from here again. One complaint: the employee who took my order was completely clueless. Didn't know if they delivered in my area, made me repeat everything 3 times, and forgot to get all my info so someone else had to call me back. That part was frustrating."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp. The large pizza doesn't seem too big but will surprisingly fill you up! Make sure when you order you get half-n-half otherwise you'll get bored with one flavour. I personally suggest the salty swine and the jerk half-n-half -- a perfect combination of salty and sweet (the jerk chicken is a bit on the sweet side). The Maui Wowee is also another good option, it's a bit different take on the classical hawaiian pizza. The people who make your pizza put on a show for you, and the wood burning oven is used from roasting toppings (pineapples) to cooking pizzas. The pineapples are actually shavings of pinepples, not chunks (a good thing). I would strongly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"When I heard about a new wood burning oven pizza place opening up, I knew I had to go try it. Even better was the fact that it had opened up in a neighbourhood I pass by every day.  Brick House Pizza Co itself is a fairly new restaurant. Located in Streetsville, it's situated in the same plaza as its sister restaurant, Saucy. However, don't come here expecting a sit down meal.. it's strictly a counter for ordering/cashing out with a very clear view of the brick oven less than 5 feet away from you.  I placed my take out order via phone and it was ready for pick up after 15 minutes.  Maui Wowie ($18 Large) This is BHP's take on the traditional Hawaiian pizza. In addition to pineapple, bacon and ham, it also had roasted peppers. One thing that stood out to me with this pizza was how the pineapple was 'shaved' instead of the usual tiny chunks (that you would find out of a can). This made the pizza look more appealing and also gave it a different texture overall. The ham had a nice salty bite to it, but it it could have used a bit more bacon.   Pesto Chicken ($18 Large) Chicken, pesto, mushrooms and Swiss cheese.. definitely a solid combination. The flavour for this one was good and everything worked well together. The chicken was a bit dry, though. But since it was all chicken breast, it was within acceptable limits.  Mama Roni ($15 Large) Pepperoni and lots of mozzarella cheese - a favourite for many. There was definitely a a good amount of cheese on this pizza. If you looked at the cross section, the layer of cheese was even thicker than the crust! The pepperoni was crispy and salty, no complaints there.  Given the fresh toppings and good combination of flavours, I really wanted to like the pizzas I tried. However, there was one fatal issue... the crust. I can understand that the crust on a pizza cooked in such a high temperature oven would be prone to some charring. What I can't accept is biting into my pizza and tasting charcoal from an obviously burned bottom (see picture), especially not at this price level. While all three of the pizzas ordered suffered the same issue in varying degrees, this may very well have been a one-off instance, being a relatively new place and all. Until I make another round here, I won't know.  Also, they need to put their hours up on their website somewhere."}
{"text":"Ho Hum. Over priced. Disappointed after reading all the great reviews. I had The Jerk L  Girlfriend had the Pesto Chicken L."}
{"text":"My wife and I were super excited to see a real pizza spot opening up in Streetsville. Excited, but cautious.  Enough \"authentic\" wood-fired pizza has come and gone in Sauga to give us a healthy skepticism.    Very, very happy to report that Brick House is the real deal.  They deliver on their fresh ingredients promise, they deliver on their cooked to crusty perfection promise. We've been 4 times on the last 5 or 6 weeks, and everything we've ordered has been exceptional.  Just way better than anything else in Sauga.  Their pizzas are so spot on.  Really interesting flavour sets.  We've had the Magnum PI and the pepperoni so far.  We planned on trying more pizza styles but the incredible, perfect meatball sandwiches got in the way.    \"Ball Breakers\", they call them.  Straight up pizza dough with meatballs and mushrooms generously layered on before being slipped into the wood-fired oven... literally perfect.   But, arguably, still not the best thing on the menu.  The Brick Breads.  The Brick Breads.  So far we've tried the Garlic & Parm, and the Bacon, Jalapeno, and White Cheddar breads.  They are mind blasting.  You will wish you'd only ordered a huge set of Brick Breads.  This place is incredible.  It sucks that Simon's 3-star rating due to his \"burnt\" crust is dragging this place's rating down.  Just go and try it.  It will fix your life.  :)"}
