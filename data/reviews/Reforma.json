{"text":"Just come.   This place is brand-new Mexican spot on the ever-popular Baldwin stretch and it is fantastic! Had lunch there today and couldn't have been happier.   The menu is smallish but interesting; it seems they also have a daily special that isn't on the menu. It consists of mostly tapas-type dishes and plates inspired by mexican street food, at very reasonable prices for the quality....its a great menu to order a bunch of dishes and share.   Today's special was queso fundido (~$8), a delectable combo of chorizo sausage, cilantro, melty cheese (and probably other things I've forgotten) served with 4 or 5 warm corn tortillas and pickled onions...it was to die for. I seriously considered licking the bowl in public. This would be an amazing starter to share as well, as long as you aren't territorial about your cheese like me ;)  I also had the beef flauta, which was perfectly crispy without being greasy, steak well-seasoned and topped with lettuce, crema and cotija cheese ($5). This went fantastically with the 3 house made salsas (none of which were overly spicy by my hot-freak tendencies but were pleasantly flavoured).    The beer (I think $7) was icy cold and a perfect accompaniment, especially since I sat on the patio, which is great to people-watch. I didn't try the margarita or Sangria but other people seemed to be enjoying theirs. The staff (including the owner, manager, chef) all interacted with the patrons and were lovely; service was phenomenal. I even got a sample of their CANDIED BACON, which has, I believe, maple syrup and jalape√±os and was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Reforma is a lovely place with pleasant, relaxed and casual atmosphere. Super-attentive staff, even got to meet the chef.  We tried the choriqueso, beef and chicken tacos, guacamole and chips, and Mexican beer, course. All was great, but I especially loved the choriqueso!  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"We had: guacamole with fried tortilla and yucca chips + pork rinds, handheld caesar salad, steak tacos and gobernador tacos. You assemble the caesar salad wraps in Bibb lettuce leaves and the bacon is amazing. The dish was a standout for me because it's notably different.   Everything else was really great - just the right amount of flavour and fresh, fresh, fresh. I can see some people finding it plain or boring (i.e. not spicy or salty enough) but for me, this is simple Mexican food at its best, and it's something we don't get enough of in this city."}
{"text":"First and foremost I want to say that the food here is very decent and well priced. The really sad thing is that the service utterly and completely let down the food. When the servers were asked about the beers on offer they could only say which one they bought for their house... it then took over half an hour to bring a bottle of beer. Did I mention that this restaurant only has seven tables and even with two servers we didn't get any attention. This should not be a struggle. It's a bit comical also considering the menu states a 1.5hr seating limit when the service didn't even make that at all realistic. The owner was the only person on the ball and was attentive and helped problem solve. While this may be a good spot one day, this is not worth your time until the front of house gets it together."}
{"text":"From all the Mexican restaurant options in Toronto, this is a pretty good one. Food is very consistent to real Mexican food without the unnecessary stuff that other places push you like slaw on tacos and rice & beans with main dishes. Prices are very reasonable and vibe is pretty cool, combined with a good location. Service is noticeable since the management staff clearly has experience in the industry. As a Mexican in TO, this place definitely will be part of my regular go-to options."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for dinner at 6 at Reforma which on the website said would be open at 5:30.  I arrived at 5:50 to find the entrance barred.  The owner came outside to smoke and I asked if the restaurant were open.  He said it would be open at 6 and he hadn't changed the website.  We returned at 6 and the entrance was still barred.  We knocked and the owner said they would open at 6:30 ?!? He offered no explanation or apology.  We found another restaurant and had a nice dinner.  At 8, we looked at Reforma which was finally open.    Because of this lack of professionalism, I will never return to Reforma."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. Very sophisticated tacos. Not a taco bar but a more mesmerizing and tantalizing delicious experience."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food presented in a modern way. Loved everything about this place. Great knowledgeable staff and vibrant ambiance too."}
