{"text":"I bought a birthday cake here, don't remember the name but it had berries inside with white fluffy filling. Omg it was so good, everyone loved it and it was gone before I knew it! What I love about this bakery is that the cakes and pastries have a home made taste to them.   You can literally taste the quality! Super fresh and all hand made."}
{"text":"Pre-ordered a small swiss chocolate cake for someone's bday. It was super bomb. Tried a couple pastries and a chocolate - also legit.   It's a pretty fancy place on the inside, but the prices are reasonable for the quality.  The owners are also really nice, which makes me want to support this place even more."}
{"text":"Bought an amazing triple chocolate mocha cake here for my husband's birthday, it smelled and tasted incredible! They also sell all kinds of beautiful pastries and cakes by the slice, you SHOULD sit down with a hot beverage and have a treat :) One thing though, this cafe has several front steps so it's not very accessible but the owners are super helpful if you try to enter with a stroller."}
{"text":"Great little place in Long Branch. Wouldn't recommend it for its coffee (latte out of a coffee maker) but their service and pastry selection is exquisite. Cannot comment on their cakes yet but we tasted the following:  - apple and cherry strudels - very tasty; apple wins! - plum tart - tasty but too sweet for our liking - napoleon pastry - have had better to be honest. It's filled with custard wheras the real thing is loaded with cream, buttercream (yum!)   We would like to go back for their cakes so another review may be 5* :-)"}
