{"text":"Meh. Was excited to try and it was a bust. I'll be heading across the street to King Wah. Prices are pretty high for the small portions. My veggies weren't even cooked all the way."}
{"text":"My husband and I both got bowls. I got the general chicken and he got the Cleveland bowl. Everything tasted charred and burnt. Not impressed. Was expecting more of a Huhot type flavoring but was let down. Even the edamame had no flavor and was not even salted...the plain noodles were also charred."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has such negative reviews. I usually go here once or twice a month and the quality of the food is always great. This place is basically set up as subway for sushi. The sushi is definitely Americanized, but it's customizable and the options for the fillings are tasty. The only problem with the place is how long it takes to make the food. The machine that spits the rice out is often broken. However if you just order on their website ahead of time the wait problem is easily solved. Overall solid food that just takes awhile."}
{"text":"Squeaky clean and modern decor but a limited make it up yourself menu. Amount of protein in your dish will be minimum. Good for a quick lunch if you're not too hungry. Staff is friendly and helpful. Somewhat expensive for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"My recommendation for what to order at Enzo? Turn around, get back into your car, and drive to Heinen's. Their ready to eat sushi rolls and Asian noodle pasta salad is WAY better and you will not suffer from indigestion all night. 

More details -
while other reviews comment that there was too much sauce, we barely had any sauce. Therefore the only flavor was of burnt oil. Not enough veggies for our taste. The beef was fine though again no Asian flavor to speak of.

Veggie nori rolls are usually a big hit with my kids-we all tried one piece and the rest ended up in the garbage. The yum-yum sauce is NOT yummy.

Not one person in my family finished their bowl and none of us kept the leftovers. 

Tried it once, will not be going back. For the price and quickness of service there are significantly better Asian options close by."}
{"text":"I really tried to like it here, I really did.  The ambiance is great, service was good and sushi options were aplenty. I just truly did not enjoy. I got a California roll (bland, I know) but I was a little skeezed out eating fish from a place that serves pulled pork sushi. And that is where my good experience ended. Avocado was mushy and brown, cucumber was... mealy? The cucumbers must've sitting out all day and were less than appetizing. The house sauce accompanying it was more of a mayo and tasted faintly like Miracle Whip. The quality just is not here. Warm, waterlogged, gummy rice and mealy cucumber does not a good sushi roll make. I would definitely skip this place. If you're in the mood for sushi with the same type of concept (just executed better) go to Project Sushi in Medina."}
{"text":"Just awful. Good concept, poor execution. Idea is to design your own bowl. Noodles are not good. You can find better sauce in grocery store. And machine prepped sushi? No way!"}
{"text":"Why can't they just serve some traditional sushi?! 
I've tried this place 3 times, each visit has been worse. I want to support a convenient new restaurant, but this place needs to revisit their concept and management."}
{"text":"Love this place, we consistently eat here at least every other week. Employees are always super nice and quick."}
{"text":"Neat concept...horrible food. My $7.99 sushi roll has no flavor what so ever. There's a good portion of Tuna on it, but I can't taste it. I eat sushi all the time and also make it at home, but the sushi here is really lacking. It was fun to try out, but I'll never come again."}
{"text":"I pay a lot of money for sushi. and the fact of the matter is that I'll spend $18 on a specialty roll at a nice Japanese restaurant and sometimes it's not even that good. today I went to this location and tried a sushi roll for $7.99 and I was beyond pleased with it. It was so good. Justin was amazing and help me build the perfect sushi roll. if you love sushi I would absolutely suggest going there. it's like fast food sushi. Love it."}
{"text":"I love this place and their concept. I don't quite understand the previous reviews on taste as this is a create your own mix kind of deal. If you wanted more sauce then you could've asked for it. I personally asked for extra sauce BC I know how much I like it. They have tons of combinations you can create. I don't like sushi but I get bowls there and they have meat!!! Its Asian inspired not traditional cuisine. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who knows what they like and how to ask for it BC that's just what you get here!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I will have to agree with the one stars went there twice it is so expensive for the little bowl that u get there stengy on the amount of veg u get not enough sauce they say because everything is home made thats why its so expensive I went bk a second time to see if it would be different or better but nope its the same they stick by there stengy rule. U will be very disappointed trust me youve been warned. And today its so slow that only one person cooks and one person waits on u so I wonder if its that slow the vegs and food thats seating out could not be moving that much fresh or not just a thought."}
{"text":"Place is awsome!!!!  Love the bowls, so much flavor.  Have only had the Spicy Tuna roll, and it was great.  Would love to have the option of getting a bowl with half a sushi roll."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to try this place, We usually always pass it and decided to finally try it out. Unfortunately we were both let down. I had a rice bowl and she had the lo mein. Both were not at all what we expected. Very disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations! We split a philly roll right off the menu. It was fresh and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday! Its delicious! They make the sushi right there or you can get a noodle bowl made to order. Its quick easy and fresh. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Disappointing...I was expecting an Ahi Tuna Poke style bowl and got \"well done\" chunks of Ahi Tuna (it should be a sin to serve it cooked like that when it is so good raw or just seared rare...). I ordered to go or I would have taken it back...
The Ahi Spicy Tuna Roll was at least served raw, but it was more like ground Ahi with no substance or flavor to it...
I'll stick to Sushi places for my Ahi and anything even Panda Express had a better rice bowl...won't be going back to Enso"}
{"text":"Just ok... Their selection of what you can put into your stir fry has gone downhill. The staff is always friendly and the wait time is mimimal."}
{"text":"I truly crack up reading the reviews on places like this. No guys, it's not the most authentic sushi. I don't go to Chipotle expecting authentic Mexican. So relax. It's a fast casual sushi place, it's not Jiro Dreams of Sushi. 
When you put it in the perspective of what it is, Enso is fantastic. The price is right and I always have leftovers. I have never once had a negative experience with the food or the service. They have the gluten free options clearly marked, and even have gluten free soy sauce (it's in the to-go packets; just ask for it). I love their spicy tuna and salmon, and my fiancé could eat the surf and turf roll every day. And yes, we also adore authentic sushi. We just know how to take a chill pill and put our expectations where they need to be."}
{"text":"Over priced and with odd food combinations, you are better off just going to a real sushi place. It would cost about the same and the quality and experience would be much better."}
{"text":"Save your money and your stomach! This place is awful ( It doesn't help when you watch the girl who just made your food try something, spit it out, and then continue to fill the serving cups WHILE WEARING THE SAME GLOVES SHE JUST PUT TO HER MOUTH.) The veggies weren't even sauteed just burn a bit and the noodles were under cooked. You couldn't taste the sauce at all and at that point we left. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The Chipotle of sushi. I was in and out quick, the staff was friendly and most importantly the food was great."}
{"text":"This idea of simple accessible Asian noodle bowls and sushi rolls is a good one, but the execution is poor. I've tried it twice and have now ruled it out completely as a dining option. The first time I got the spicy tuna roll and tofu noodle bowl with teriyaki sauce. Everything just had a mushy texture and wasn't exciting. The teriyaki sauce was not good, too sweet and thick. I received coupons for two free entrees on this visit because if took so long for my noodle bowl to come out. The second time I just got the tofu noodle bowl with zesty peanut sauce. I can't tell you how awful this sauce was...very thick and tasted like I was eating noodles with straight peanut butter. It was gross. In it's favor, Enso has nice helpful staff and a nice dining area. I gave the food two shots and now it's officially \"off the list!\""}
{"text":"It only deserve 3 stars.. The reason to only 3 stars cause they over charge you for the Amount you actually get... The food is okay.. I guess the only reason at times I come back cause it's convenient & fast. Otherwise it would be bye bye"}
{"text":"Good and quick. Not going to lie I was a little unsure what to expect. Go for it! However, if your expecting gourmet sushi or a real sit down experience, this isn't for you.  It's the Chipotle of rolls and bowls."}
{"text":"One of the things I have read in most reviews about this place in which I agree with is that everyone MUST remember it's not a fancy sit down sushi restaurant. It is made to image the fast pace of american lives. It mirrors the idea of chipotle and piada. 

I had a coupon for a free bowl or roll and that is what brought on my first visit. I went during lunch time and had a good experience. I opted for a free roll and ordered their suggested Spicy Tuna Roll (Sometimes the options overwhelm me). I also ordered the Sweet Potato bowl. The Spicy Tuna Roll was to my standards really tasty. The Sweet Potato bowl was tasty except for the sauce. This particular bowl comes with a Sweet Soy sauce. To me it was so overly salty I could barely eat the bowl. As a disclaimer I do not ever add salt to food because I don't like much salt however the saltiness of this bowl was so overwhelming to me.  The other downfall of this place is that while they cook all the orders as they come in the place became rather smoky and I noticed that my clothes smelled of  smoke after leaving. 

I do like the concept of this restaurant and as a Lakewood resident I can say for a fact that there are a limited amount of places to get sushi from, so I welcome this new addition."}
{"text":"Like chipotle for Asian food. I got a bowl, and it was really good! For people saying the portion sizes were too small, I couldn't finish my bowl. Maybe they got new sizes. It is a little more than I would usually pay for a lunch, but it was a good selection of fresh veggies, and an interesting concept. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed being able to customize my own roll here as opposed to being stuck with the stores pre-made varieties. The customization also allowed for a much bigger roll than would be if it were pre-made. The flavors were all in all pretty tasty.

I also ordered the wasabi hummus which comes with won-ton chips and let me tell you, it was amazing! Definitely will be back for that. Oh, and the garlic edamame, definitely get that. The workers were very friendly and seemed to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"Definetely don't recommend Enso. Fish is for sure not fresh and the salmon gave me the flu. I was so sick and I was throwing up Enso!  Not a place for sushi- absolutely horrible. They've tried to create a fast food sushi place and that doesn't work. DO NOT GO TO ENSO!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a bunch of times, but have ordered the SAME THING EVERY TIME (spicy tuna roll and philly roll). Those rolls are pretty good. It's not the same quality/deliciousness as a real sushi joint, but it's good enough for me to stop in once every other week or so. Accordingly, this review is re: sushi and not the bowls. 

As you'll probably gather from other reviews, this is a fast-ish food option serving sushi and bowls with rice or noodles. You can choose from pre-selected sushi roll or bowl options, or you can pick all of the ingredients of your choosing for sushi or a bowl. 

Most of the \"make your own\" sushi options sound horrible to me, and are ingredients you would never find on a sushi menu. beef brisket? shredded pork? cheddar cheese? WHY? the only seafood options are: salmon, spicy salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, crabstick, spicy crabstick. I think crabstick is gross, so salmon and tuna are all that's left for sushi using fish as a protein. These are all the same proteins available for the bowls, too.

I LIKE what I order, and appreciate that I can take my order to go, but am not dying to order anything else on the menu. 

Service is hit or miss. Everyone there is friendly, but once a few sushi orders are in, it (understandably) takes a while for them to assemble the sushi, etc. and a line will form. For the bowls, they put all the ingredients in bowls, and then send it back to the grill (wok? I don't know - a magical heat source?). 

They use a machine/contraption to adhere the sushi rice to the nori and it seems like it doesn't work properly because the employees often have to add rice by hand to the bare spots. They also use a machine to cut the sushi which sometimes leaves the end sushi pieces all wonky with little of the fillings. 

in summary: yeah, it's okay as long as you keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place...I try to go at least once every couple weeks. I've finally perfected my roll...spicy salmon, spicy crab, cucumber, cream cheese, and avocado all topped with 5 spice mayo and sesame seeds. 

I saw a lot of the reviews complaining about the price but if u look at the size of the roll your getting and compare it to others their rolls are much larger."}
{"text":"Very good, but spotty service. Sometimes very slow and mix up orders. Overall great food! Sweet soy is very good, meat and fish all good quality."}
{"text":"Overall: Neat concept, but complete failure. The deal breaker was how expensive it was for possibly the worst meal I've ever had in my life. Save your money and tastebuds and head to the food court at the mall.

Food:  We ordered 2 sushi rolls and a sushi bowl. The sushi rice and rice for the bowl was laughable. Zero flavor, gummy texture. I may as well have been eating mushy Minute rice. The meat portions were also terrible; there may have been one coffee spoonful worth of meat on each portion. Toppings also lacked flavor.  About the only good thing was the pre-bought bottle of Sriracha they had on the table! The food was so bad I had to drown it in Sriracha to make it edible. And the bill was well over $30.

Service: It was extremely awkward to watch the server fumble his way through making a sushi roll with shaking, indecisive hands. I almost wanted to go behind the counter and roll my own sushi roll."}
{"text":"Service was fast, friendly and helpful, but that's where anything good ended. The surf and turf roll fell apart just trying to pick a piece of it up.! The rice in the general chicken bowl was hard and undercooked. Very over priced for what amounts to less than mediocre fast food. First time here, we arrived 20 minutes prior to closing and everything was put away. They did offer to prepare something, but we declined. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Participated in the yelp event here yesterday and was thoroughly happy with the experience. One major plus of enso is the staff. They were friendly, knowledgeable and fun. They not only helped me build a custom bowl, but made great suggestions that I felt really added to the quality and taste.

Foodwise, there is a little room for improvement. I got a spicy tuna and veggie brown rice bowl and the protein portion was very small (also could have been because I got it to go, but I'm unsure.) The quality of the tuna and veggies, and the array of sauces were also great. I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for some Asian fusion that is quick and customizable, but not as a fine dining or high end experience. Overall, very good! Cheers to yelp for organizing too or else I would not have stopped in."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite go to spots when I want something fresh. I love their spicy tuna with the peanut sauce. The wasabi hummus could be sold in a bucket and I would buy it up. There was an issue with my order the first time I went and the manager was very generous to fix the situation as he did. 
I definitely recommend this to someone who wants something fresh and customizable!"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for lunch! Being vegan there are so many options! Tofu bowls with as many veggies as we want! Veggies are fresh and delicious. Really love this spot!"}
{"text":"Went in optimistic. Nori quality ruins the roll. Proteins are pretty good. OK in a pinch, try the soy wrap over the nori though."}
{"text":"On the way home from soccer practice in Rocky River about two weeks ago, we noticed a completely new restaurant in the Westgate plaza. After checking the menu online, we decided to give it a shot since it seemed like an \"Asian Chipotle.\" Enso's menu was very similar to places such as Chipotle and Piada in the sense that you choose between a sushi roll, or a noodle bowl, and you are then able to choose your meat, sauce, and toppings (veggies, \"wonton crunch,\" etc.) We ended up ordering four of the noodle bowls and two bags of the wonton chips for take-out. Although each bowl was different in terms of ingredients, everyone seemed to agree that the food was pretty nasty. My sister's udon noodle bowl with chicken had some strange sauce on it and when combined with the fact that the noodles were undercooked, the result was some sort of a mac-and-cheese gone wrong. The teriyaki lo mein bowl was overly sweet, while the beef was your typical Chinese restaurant lo mein beef. My parents both agreed that their bowls were either too salty or sweet due to the sauce, and also cited the small amount of veggies and meat added as a reason for not enjoying the meal. The side of \"wonton chips,\" just made matters worse, as they were overly salty and greasy. Next time we're looking for a quick meal in Rocky River,we'll be sure to just opt for the much-better Piada, or the time-tested Chipotle."}
{"text":"Anyone going here expect a traditional sushi restaurant experience is going to be disappointed and is missing the point. The sushi is what it is - slightly above average grocery store quality sushi at or less than what Giant Eagle or Earthfare charges. The bowls are more substantial and a good amount of food for the price. Lots of toppings but not as good food quality as a Stir Crazy or Mongolian BBQ (but faster and slightly cheaper). All the sauces are on the sweet size for my tastes. A soy-ginger or ponzu sauce option would be nice. The sides seem like good ideas but the execution of them are underwhelming. 

The service (and manager/owner) are fast and friendly. They do a good job.
The decor and atmosphere are nice enough. Cozy, soy and sriracha on every table. 

Overall: Not somewhere I need to go every week but good enough to satisfy a Japanese food craving in a pinch."}
{"text":"First time ever getting food at Enso tonight and I found a hair in my roll. I was debating whether or not I should share this (as I've never posted a negative review on yelp before) but this is a very concerning quality control and public health issue. None of the employees even wear hairnets. Ive included a picture of what would have been my first bite into the roll. Safe to say I asked for a refund. Thankfully the manager obliged and returned my money."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and got the spicy tuna roll to go. It was excellent. The flavor was not fishy or overwhelming--it had just the right amount of kick. Also--you get a good amount of food--there is no skimping here--which made it well worth $7.99. The roll is made to order right in front of you--if you want to add additional toppings, you can. The toppings looked very fresh and they put your roll in a cool white cardboard \"roll in/roll out\" box. They also have a happy hour at this place that they told me about, and asked if I wanted a shopper's type card. I did. This is a nice place. The staff answered questions I had about toppings and how to prepare seaweed sheets I have at home. Very helpful. I will be back."}
{"text":"I kinda wanted to give this place a 2.5. Not because it's \"bad\", but because it just isn't that good. I know, I shouldn't be expecting great sushi to come out from a fast casual type sushi place. The concept is really cool, and the prices are very reasonable for the roll size, and the fact that it's fresh fish. The service is quick and great, but after having good sushi, I just can't bring myself to enjoy Enzo. 

If you're going to get some sushi here, spicy salmon or spicy tuna is the way to go."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to go eat after I workout when I'm looking for something light, healthy and delicious. My favorite is the California roll with tofu, yum yum sauce and a side of edamame salad. Quick & friendly service too!"}
{"text":"i like the THOUGHT behind the idea of this place, but i think it stops there. The food was bland, no flavoring, the menu was small and expensive for getting small portions.

I got a bowl which was literally swimming in sauce, it overpowered all the veggies i had gotten in it. I ordered a shrimp bowl with noodles and brown rice and their yum yum sauce. 2 freaking cups full of yum yum sauce had to be in my bowl, the shrimp was burned and tasteless. my noodles were stale, i was probably better off eating some ramen at this point.

my other gripe was the service, rude and slow, but when you take a look at the menu they are quick to rush you out of the line."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch, had a choose your own bowl and my boyfriend had the spicy tuna roll. Both were great and I felt like it was a good value for the price. Staff was friendly and helpful, our rolls didn't fall apart while eating. I really like that you can choose exactly what you want!"}
{"text":"Good concept.  I had the Salmon bowl with veggies and brown rice and the Wasabi Hummus with the fried Wontons.  I obviously cannot comment on how the sushi was, but the bowl, for the most part, have the same ingredients.  It is exactly like going to Subway and either making the toppings go in a sub or a salad or going to Chipotle and making the ingredients go into a buritto or bowl.  Only here, they take the bowl you fill up and either put it in a sushi rolling machine or stir fry it together with noodles or rice of your choice.  This process can be awesome or disconcerting at the same time.  When I chose the ingredients to fill my teriyaki bowl, I decided to load it with all the veggies because 1) veggies are good for me 2) Hell!  Why not? If I am paying for something, why not get all that I can from it!  So, as they were filling the bowl, I noticed that they only filled a small 2-3 ounce plastic ramiken full of Salmon.  That would probably be a sufficient amount of Salmon for a Sushi roll, but certainly not for a Teriyaki bowl!  It sould have been double that.  Conversely, If I would have decided to have a roll instead and would have added all the ingrdients like I did in the bowl, that roll would have been hard to wrap and very difficult to eat!

I don't think it would be worth it to go for the upcharged \"Spicy Tuna\" or \"Spicy Salmon\" because all the employees told me they were just the fish with a little bit of Siracha added to it.  Why would I pay extra for something that I can just do myself at the table?! That is like me going to a Mcdonalds and paying $.50 extra for them to put ketchup on it!

I wish they would have had fresh Jalepeno to available for me to put in my bowl or roll.  

The wasabi hummus and fried wontons are a refreshing Asian spin to a Middle-Eastern staple.  They even had these really cool fork/chop stick utensils.  You can use a chopstick, and when you get bored or tired of using the chopsticks, you flip the utensil 180 degrees and Viola!  You have got a fork!  Careful, your hand will get a little messy if you flip them around too many times in one sitting.

Finally, the employees are very nice, enthusiastic an accomodating.
Overall, I would give this place a 3.5, so a 4 because I believe in rounding up! :-). It is worth trying."}
{"text":"Dear Lord no, when we asked about their yum sauce we were led to believe that it was yum yum sauce, it was disgusting. I told the manager their food did not have enough meat or sauce and all they could say was it was already weighed out for the day. Really what happened to people caring about food and tasting it and seeing if its appealing. There was so much rice and barely any meat...and their sushi they were like we are trying something new a fast food sushi place, I was like the one inside summit mall tastes better than this place and knows what kind of sauce to use with sushi. People should take more pride in making food, also one of the chefs was eating his food while in the cooking area how unsanitary and definitely not up to health code. My whole family ended up going to eat at taco bell after we didnt finish the food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"fast food\" I have tried many menu items and liked each one! The sushi is phenomenal! I typically order the wasabi hummus and wanton chips in addition to my bowl. Great vegetarian option- I'm a mean eater but usually end of getting the sushi because it's so good. Great place for a quick eat!"}
{"text":"We were so excited about the concept when we first found out about Enso.  We love Stir Crazy and BD Mongolian BBQ.  But this place is truly awful. We have been here 4 times now, always ordered bowls, and each time has been awful.  There's a few major problems with this place.

1) the toppings suck, and they give you a minimal amount.  No pineapple, corn, spinach, tomato, etc.  very lacking in the toppings department.  Asking for onion gives you about 4 little slices.  After deciding that you're done picking toppings, my bowl isn't even 1/3 full.  Very stingy.

2) the meat is terrible quality, and again a minimal amount.  The chicken is like dry fake chicken shavings. Never more than literally a tablespoon or two.

3) not nearly enough sauce on the bowl.  DRY. like SUPER DRY bowls after they put a teeny scoop on the top.  They do not cook the meals in the sauce, a tiny amount is spooned on top.  Not to mention the fact that tonight when we got our bowls, they put ginger salad dressing on by mistake instead of sweet and sour.  It didn't look right when I saw it and I asked if it was sweet and sour, she assured me it was.  Well lo and behold when we got it home and tasted the red odd looking sauce it was obviously salad dressing and my husband had to drive all the way back to have them redo them.

Ultimately this place is terrible. We have been disappointed every single time but tonight is the last. Nobody is ever in there anymore. Such a disappointment for such a promising concept."}
{"text":"First experience was decent... But this second round is much better! I think I've perfected my roll.... If your roll/bowl isn't good, well you made it so it's kinda your fault. I suggest this place for a quick, cheap, filling lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"The Chipotle of Asian food. But Chipotle is much better!   Its a fast food concept for noodles, but the food itself isn't very good and the price is high for what you are getting.  Furthermore, the decor doesn't match that concept. So neither the food or the environment is pleasing. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"ok. so understanding that i don't eat fish and i can't comment on the spicy tuna or salmon or whatever else people have issue, i can provide a reasonable assessment of the place and the veggie options.
alright, so, point one, the sushi does seem a little bit overpriced. 8 for all rolls? i dunno about that.. i guess you can get like anything you want on it but what if you just like avocado and cucumber? i'd rather get two small rolls for like 4-5 each than have to stuff everything into one. some combination tastes better. i think they need to rethink their pricing. like 1-2 items should be 4 and each additional item should be $1, or something.
second point, yeah most of the time, if your food doesn't taste good at a pick your own items kinda place, it's prob your fault! if you put carrots, spicy tuna, water chestnuts, broccoli, and strawberry with wasabi glaze on your sushi or bowl, work on your decision making skills before you blame it on the restaurant.
i had tofu, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, red peppers, and pineapple with udon noodles and sweet soy and zesty peanut sauces. it was delicious. tofu was good! the udon was just the right amount of chewy. PW went for some mango avocado combination which sounds great too. my guest had like spicy tuna, water chestnuts, and green peppers, or something equally weird. with general tso's sauce. yeah...
so overall, good place, esp for vegetarians, or other lovers of tofu, and lovers of udon."}
{"text":"New find. A handful of sushi roll selections and a handful of rice bowl selections, or make your own roll or bowl for mostly under $10 makes for a pretty satisfying meal. I had the spicy tuna roll. It's not Ginko or Shinto, but it hit the spot. Definitely worth a return visit. I just REALLY wish they had poke bowls!!!"}
{"text":"First day jitters.  Machines spread the rice and slice the rolls.  Apparently no backup plan if the machines go buggy.  Spicy tuna roll was OK, but falling apart.  Sushi masters???? Not yet..."}
{"text":"Pretty sketchy to have such young inexperienced people handling raw food. Stomach isn't feeling too great after eating there. Spicy mayo is not the spicy mayo you get at sushi bars. It was almost like a chipotle sauce which was a let down because I love putting spicy mayo on my sushi. I also asked for brown rice, and the rice i got was white. They said that was brown rice, but I have never seen brown rice that is white. I also thought the bowls were extremely overpriced and mine was almost Not edible. Tasted very burnt and had no sauce or flavor. I had to add a bunch of sauce to mine when I got home and it still tasted bad. I've been to a place with this sort of concept in Athens who executed their bowls way better and had double the amount of food for the same price. I know this place is new but it definitely needs a lot of work. The flavors just aren't there at all. I might try it again once they work out the kinks, but in all honesty id rather eat the sushi from heinans. 

The upside however was that the manager, or maybe owner, seemed very friendly. 

Ps: get real chopsticks"}
{"text":"I'd probably rate Enso's a 2.5, I agree with a number of the previous comments. I'm not going to pretend that I'm a sushi connoisseur, but I agree that the amount of protein is lacking. Additionally, all the ingredients in general were lacking flavor. I asked for spicy mayo on the inside of my roll and was informed that they couldn't put sauces on the inside. I don't understand why not. If you are looking for a quick fast food sushi place this place may satisfy your need, but I wouldn't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Very friendly and knowledgable crew working here! I got a chicken and veggie bowl with brown rice! Teriyaki sauce was good and the veggies were cooked perfect! Also got a side of wasabi hummus! It's very good, but I'm perfectly filled by my bowl! I can't wait to snack on it after work! A little pricey for the portions I got, but veggies aren't always the cheapest, I'll live! Workers are a little younger, but they are very friendly! Can't wait to bring my husband here!"}
{"text":"Yum! This place has fresh veggies out and you pick what you want in sushi or a stir fry bowl. I got a spicy tuna roll which was delicious. It came in a seaweed wrap. It was $10.50 for one roll and a drink. I would go back if I was around there.  It is a good place for a casual lunch, or lunch with a coworker."}
{"text":"Family went here for a mid-afternoon meal today so we were the only customers there.  I got the California roll, only one piece fell apart so I guess that's good.  Yum sauce was good.  Wife and daughter got chicken bowls, they were about half the size of the bowls in the photos and served in square paper containers.  They also pulled the \"Do you want Udon noodles with that?\" trick so that they could upcharge them $1 each.  Moderate prices with moderately small servings."}
{"text":"Eh... Ordered salmon bowl. Way over cooked, drenched in sauce that made it like eating soup. Pretty bad. 
I'll come back again and try a roll. I realize it's fast food but for $11 not impressed or worth it at all."}
{"text":"Enso is perfect for you if you want Asian-inspired food without having to expand your palette.  Obviously, you don't go to a fast-casual restaurant for an authentic experience, but compared to the other \"ethnic\" fast casual places in town, this place missed the mark for me due to lack of flavor, portion size, and cost.  My husband got a rice bowl with fish and veggies. There really wasn't a lot of fish in there and the rice wasn't flavored at all.  I created my own tofu and lo mein bowl. The noodles were good but they seemed more like spaghetti than lo mein. I liked the texture of the tofu and there was a wide array of fresh veggies. It was a healthy meal that left me full but not stuffed. But I think I would go somewhere else for stir fry next time."}
{"text":"Stumbled in randomly, saw it passing by. It's basically like chipotle with Asian food. 

I loved how they have suggested entrées, I'm a horrible cook so I enjoy having them tell me what combination to make. 

Went with veggie Lo mein, made with a smooth peanut sauce.  It was a bit bland for my taste, but certainly delicious! I tend to enjoy food on the spicy side, so next time I'll experiment with the sauce. 

Came in a pretty big bowl, about the same food size as a chipotle bowl. Was $9, in my opinion a bit high, however it appears to be healthier than alternative options so I suppose it's worth it. 

Restaurant is very clean, food is fresh, nice quiet atmosphere. I will likely return"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy or highbrow about this place. If you are expecting Morimoto type food, don't go. This is a simple fast food sushi and bowl type place. What we had was good for this type of place. Our experience was nice, great service and clean! We will go back."}
{"text":"Really good sushi! Online ordering is the shizzy! :D will be ordering again soon because I am hungry for sushi."}
{"text":"Terrific concept, delicious food and healthy choices. The customer service was pretty good and place was super clean"}
{"text":"Went for the free Yelp event.  Enso is an Asian fast food in the Chipolte style.  You come in and pick a Sushi Roll or a stirfry bowl with rice or noodles.  Then you go through the line and let them know what ingredients you want.  I had a noodle bowl with shrimp and the Enso sauce.  After picking out the ingredients they give it back to the kitchen to cook.  Took about 5 minutes and then you get a very nice bowl of food.  The cooking was just right, the noodles what I would describe as ramen style.  The sauce was nice, could have a bit more flavor.

Also got to try the wasbi hummus with the wanton chips.  The hummus was good with a prominent wasabi flavor, without burning your mouth.  The wanton chips were fresh and very tasty.

The decor was modern industrial, which worked very well.  Enso has potential; one suggestion is to add some broths so that they can do a ramen soup bowl."}
{"text":"Nasty sushi.  If you really like sushi, don't try this place.  Both the tuna and salmon are gross.  It's nice having a make your own sushi bar...I should have trusted my first instinct, to leave when I saw the tuna, salmon and even the chicken and beef.  First visual is important!  Nice staff though!.  This place is even a step below getting sushi from Giant Eagle.  Needs work."}
{"text":"Came in the other day and wasn't quite sure what to expect. I did not appreciate the obnoxious techno music blaring at me when I walked in the door. For the food, I was excited to see all the vegetarian options. However, the tofu was way too salty. I did not enjoy my meal. It's a bad Asian version of Chipotle."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for a quick lunch. Should have stuck to my rules, no chain restaurants but I didn't. Service was reasonably friendly, although not very informative about how the process worked. (Very chipotle like). The food was average at best and the chicken they used was clearly old and out of date. I ended up eating the rice with spicy peanut sauce, leaving the fatty chicken parts behind. Certainly WAY over priced for what you get. I will not return and some office colleagues shared similar stories."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, I had a tune and salmon roll on Nori with brown rice with avacado,cream cheese and asparagus, very good. I also had chicken stir fry with udon noodles and veggies, the serving size should be a little bigger. I Like being able to pick what you want to go in your rolls or stir fry's. Kinda the Subway or Chipoltes of rolls and rice/noodle bowls."}
{"text":"Not bad, not good...just meh.  Love the concept, don't like the result as much as I thought I would."}
{"text":"WHHHHAAATTT Chipotle style Sushi...count me in! As you walk in you are greeted right away by the extremely friendly staff. The servers behind the counter ask if you've been here before so they can assist you with what to get if you haven't or want to try something new. I had the spicy tuna roll (regular style) and was blown away. I definitely think it was the spicy mayo-not your typical spicy mayo but sweet/hot/bbq style along the top of the roll. The average price for your roll is $10 which is the same amount if you were to buy from heinens. I cant wait to come back and try more options!!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of the place. Food is good. Workers are horrible and terribly slow even when you're the only customer in there. Takes about 15 minutes to order one sushi roll in an empty restaurant. Rice machine and roll cutter are never working"}
{"text":"This is a great idea poorly executed. Sushi is an art for it can't be mass produced.  The inside is nice and clean but again mass produced. The quality is ok but not great.   Prices are ok"}
{"text":"Pho real: amazing food here. Think Chipotle of Asian-inspires dishes. I happen to love the pho noodle bowl best. It was a apecial they had in April, I got it with lots of mushrooms and other veggies and it was delicious! But I've gotten interesting creations out of random mixing of veggies and sauces. I highly recommend the peanut sauce with chicken. Be sure to add siracha sauce for a nice kick."}
{"text":"I read all the bad reviews on here and was hesitant to even try it. But, I went anyways and I'm happy I did. I got a tofu bowl with udon noodles and peanut sauce. I loved it! I ate the whole thing and didn't even mean to. I also got a side of wasabi hummus and wonton chips because of all the good reviews on it, and I honestly am not a fan. I guess it's an acquired taste? The staff was nice and it was really clean. I also read a few reviews about high prices, but I thought it was actually pretty cheap. I got the special noodles which were a dollar extra, avocado which was extra, the bowl itself, and a side all for around 10 dollars. To me it was a good deal. I thought it was enough food to even split if you were looking for something light. I'd for sure come back"}
{"text":"This was my first time getting sushi ever. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but this lowered my already low expectations. My expectations are now lower than magma. I understand it's not authentic sushi so I wasn't assuming it would be something totally amazing but I was at least hoping it would be edible. I have been here for a half an hour and I have yet to breathe through my nose. I held my breath while eating, hoping that it would taste better if I couldn't smell it. I was sadly mistaken. I'm sure it's not the workers fault or anything. Except the girl she was rude. I had never been here before and I felt attacked. She was rushing me and got snippy with me when I didn't answer right away. Please don't eat the seaweed ):"}
{"text":"as another yelper stated, i really wanted to give 2.5 stars and not a full 3! 
now with that being said, it's a great idea/concept. honestly, the food is good for a quick sushi fix. i have only ordered the sushi so can not comment on the bowls. 
i, do however LOVE the wonton chips and wasabi hummus! delish!
the rolls are actually nice size. 
another plus: they serve adult beverages! woooo! also, have a little happy hour pricing which is positive, in my opinion.
i love having lots of options as far as sauces, fillings, etc. there are plenty to choose. brown/white rice etc.
enso, i will be back. you never know when that sushi craving is going to hit!"}
{"text":"This place is a bad Asian version of chipotle. The bowls are tiny for the amount that you pay. They should at least bulk up the vegetables and meat rather than the rice if they're charging 8 or 9 bucks for it. Also, the over simplified sauce was a disgrace to Asian cuisine. I didn't even think about getting sushi because, to be completely honest, I don't trust the young staff to serve me raw fish that is safe to eat. Whoever came up with this concept is a fucking moron. I will not return and I hope that someone doesn't get sick from eating this fast food sushi. C'mon guys."}
{"text":"I was in the area, just finished watching a movie at the AMC Westwood Theater.  I had heard about this new sushi place so I figured I would give it a whirl.  They didn't have much to choose from. Salmon, Spicy Tuna, California, Philadelphia, and some kind of Beef Roll. You can create your own, but I wasn't in the mood to pick and choose....I was starving and I just wanted sushi.

I chose the Spicy Tuna and the California.  The rolls are huge, but that is because there is so much rice!  The nori was tough like cardboard.   The spicy mayo didn't taste like spicy mayo and the yum yum sauce didn't taste like yum yum sauce!  There was no flavor whatsoever. The tuna was red.....probably from the spicy sauce it was marinating in?? 

Also, I felt that they were overpriced. Their rolls were $8 !!  I went to Morimoto in NYC, which is a highly renowned sushi restaurant and most of their rolls were only 7.5-8.50

Although, I had a bad experience, I'll probably go back.  I think I just ordered the wrong thing.   Maybe I'll order the beef roll or one of their bowls.  I can't not like a restaurant just because the spicy tuna and California roll weren't the best. 
Plus, the employees were really nice and upbeat, the décor was really cute too"}
{"text":"I've tried a different chipotle style sushi place like this before and loved it but my experience here was pretty mediocre at best. I was really hungry and didn't think a roll was enough, so I got the noodle bowl. I LOVE sushi so i was excited to eat some raw fish. I got the salmon and picked out the noodle and the veggies and they bring it all back to the cooks to stir fry it. Maybe it was ridiculous for me to expect that they would keep the sushi salmon raw - it came out cooked, which was a bit of a bummer. I kinda wished they warned me about that. That aside, it was definitely under seasoned and needed soy sauce. 

Although I didn't eat the rolls, I saw how they were made. A bit skimpy on the actual fish in my opinion. They're bulked up with alot of rice to get the bigger size. 

So for the price - meh."}
{"text":"Great concept. Very tasty food. When coming here think \"Chipotle\" but with Japanese food. I had a tuna roll, wife had a chicken with noodles. Both were great. We WILL be coming back many times again  

I would like to add that my wife is not a big fan of Japanese food. She likes it. But she is extremely picky about what she will eat at a Japanese restaurant. She loves Enso!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for quick take out one night mainly because I have been on a noodle kick lately. The noodle bowl was OK, decently priced.  We both got chicken and I enjoyed the sauce (spicy thai/general tso), the amount of veggies put in were OK.  They seemed fresh enough. I got lomain and my husband got ramen, I think the up charge for the lomain was worth it.  My main complaint was I think I found 3-4 pieces of chicken in the whole bowl. They were a strange texture and not evenly sized. The staff seemed to move a little slow (not sure if they were new) but once the bowl went back to cook it didn't take too long. Overall, it was decent. Not sure I'd make a special trip to go back unless I was in the area again and it was convenient."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Always clean, always friendly, by the food! The food is always fresh. Great options of veggies and proteins. if you don't like it it's because you chose a crappy combo of flavors. Sweet soy is so yummy with the brisket"}
{"text":"They changed the takeout bowls! So nice to not have to deal with leaky containers. 
Tofu tasted really bad today though :(
Spicy peanut is still my fav sauce."}
{"text":"I stopped by being a little skeptical of on the go sushi. Let me just say it was amazing. I got the make your own spicy salmon with asparagus, cucumber, avocado and green onion. This was an amazing combo. The rolls were huge and I had to eat it in 2 sittings. I also got the crispy wonton chips and wasabi hummus which had just enough wasabi. The amount they gave I took the rest home and spread it on a wrap. Def stopping by when I'm on this side of town again. Might go for a bowl next time as the yummy options seem endless."}
{"text":"What Chipotle does to Americanized Mexican, this place seems to have ambitions about doing for Americanized Asian fusion. It looks and feels like a chain but I guess it isn't... yet. If it goes well, I'm sure they'll make more. The food's OK and not too expensive, but it's not exactly exciting or interesting. On the plus side, they have enthusiastic service and a decent variety for carnivores and vegetarians alike. I enjoyed the handful of Asian brews on hand as well. On the downside, the food is probably best eaten with the place's ridiculous fork/chopstick combo utensil, as that best reflects its authenticity."}
{"text":"The Wasabi Hummus is my new addiction as are the Wonton Chips.  I can't speak for the sushi because it not for my taste, but it is worth stopping there just for the hummus. The bowls I enjoyed once, and they were good.   It's a cute clean little (hidden in a strip mall) restaurant. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm someone who does not eat or trust meat from fast food places, so I had my doubts about the quality of the raw fish I would be eating in a sushi roll that was $6-8 a roll... but I've been here multiple times and have been quite satisfied each time. It's freshy-fresh and It's a nice \"quick & customizable\" Asian restaurant.  I've always opted for a spicy tuna or salmon roll- maybe one day I'll venture into the bowls- but, I love creating my own rolls. I try to pack them with veggies and spicy things to see how much the nori can handle. If you are hesitant about what sauce to get, you can ask of a little taste or just get it on the side. 

Around Thanksgiving they had items like turkey, sweet potatoes, etc... so if eating Thanksgiving dinner in the form of sushi was something you have always dreamed about,  this is the place to get creative and check that off your list of food-ventures. If you're more traditional stick with some of the more classic dishes they have laid out on their menu."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. The Vegetable Lo Mein was inedible. The \"zesty\" peanut sauce was so thick and tasted like it had actually gone bad. I had very low expectations and it still managed to disappoint me. I threw out my food and will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm not certain as to why this restaurant is listed as closed - we were literally in yesterday (1/11/2015).

Enso is an interesting place. It is set up very much like a Chipotle, but with an Asian twist. The atmosphere is very simple, very basic. One step up from fast food (though I know 'fast food' is what this is advertised as), but not quite sushi bar standards. This may be in part due to how new the restaurant itself is, having only opened two days prior. 

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the ordering process of Chipotle - the customer selects a plating type, in this case the options are a sushi roll or noodle/rice bowl, picks meats/veggies/sauces (or chooses from one of the pre-selected options), and one of the cooks puts the final product together. The process may be confusing to those unfamiliar with this type of restaurant, and unfortunately there aren't any helpful signs for those who are inexperienced.

I selected a ricebowl called the 'Ocean', which consisted of tuna, salmon, snow peas, green/red peppers, pineapple and pineapple sauce. The ordering process is made a bit more difficult than it should be due to a large (around 6' high) glass wall between the customer and cook. It makes it extremely difficult to communicate or ask questions. Unfortunately this resulted in my order having quite a few problems - pineapples where they should have been none, and the asparagus/carrots and other add-ons I selected were not present. My attempts to communicate the problems to the cook before the order was prepared were not heard well - mostly due to the large glass wall and the frustrating need to yell. I have to admit that, at this point, I was rather disappointed when my $11 meal was finalized. The taste was somehow both bland and oversweetened (due to the pineapple), with minimal amounts of both tuna and salmon. The vegetables were very much undercooked and cool to the touch.

However, the manager did come by to check on us, and was very eager to correct the issues when I brought them to my attention. He explained to us the trouble the store had upon opening, and offered to remake my lunch for free. The remake was to my specifications, though I still believe the portion sizes and seasoning could use some serious work. We received two BOGO coupons and were encouraged to give them a second try, which we most certainly will. We greatly appreciate the manager taking charge and making every attempt to correct the problems.

Again, this is a concept I really enjoy and I hope the execution can be improved soon. I want to like this place very much, and if changes are made in the future, I could see it becoming one of our regular spots. Please note that if you would prefer salmon/tuna RAW, you must specify! I mistakenly assumed that raw would be the default for a place offering sushi, but apparently not."}
{"text":"This place has gone down in quality and up in price. They are understaffed because business is obviously down which just overwhelms the one person working the front. Additionally, the portion size of the food has decreased substantially while the prices went up. Vegetables are not as fresh as they could be, and flavor is bland. Used to be a fan, but after multiple disappointing experiences will not be back."}
{"text":"ENSO was a random drive-by discovery for me.  I've never heard of them, but decided to stop in for dinner on a whim, as I had an hour and a half to kill in the area after having dropped off my daughter at an evening class.  Initially, I stopped at nearby EarthFare for some seafood, but they only had some unheard of fish called 'Hoki', which is one species McDonald's uses in their Filet-O-Fish sandwiches!  Gross.  After mulling over my options, I spotted ENSO, and was glad I stopped in!  I had a rice bowl type seafood dish called 'The Ocean Club' (tuna, salmon, red & green peppers, snow peas, broccoli, wonton crunch sprinkled on top), requesting lo mein noodles and a teriyaki glaze to go with it.  It was phenomenal!  Very flavorful and well-balanced, without being too salty or sweet.  I don't want to 'split hairs' here, but this was the best (gourmet?) teriyaki glaze/sauce i've ever had!  If you think \"teriyaki sauce is teriyaki sauce\", think again!  The employees were very friendly and professional too.  I left a very happy customer, and will be returning sometime with wife and child in-tow.  Kudos to ENSO!"}
{"text":"Wasabi hummus (edamame) with wonton chips is my families new addiction. Spicy tuna roll was ok. General Tso bowl, Veggie bowl, and Asian Beef bowl weren't very good. All the bowls had a strange after taste, probably because some of the veggies and noodles were burnt. Meat in the bowls was definitely lacking."}
{"text":"I love Enso's! I live out in Brunswick and I drive all the way to Westgate just to get some! I especially love the bowls with noodles and shrimp. Oh and their Yum Yum sauce is to dye for. I only wish you would put one out by me in Brunswick or Strongsville. Keep up the good food!"}
{"text":"I got the veggie noodle bowl with chicken and snow peas. The quality of food and flavor was on point but they didn't seem to heat it up long enough in the wok. They were busy so they might have rushed it too much. Some of it was warm and some cold. The food was done by the time we got to the counter to pay so I am wondering if a food warmer would have also helped the situation. The decor was done well and everything seemed clean. I would definitely go back but might mention to have my food cooked longer."}
{"text":"Very good place for a quick meal. Kinda like a Chipotle but Japanese instead of Mexican. They even serve beer! I got a General Tso bowl for $8.99. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how so many people have left mediocre reviews of this place. I have been here a few times now and it is fantastic. Think chipotle but for sushi. I'm obsessed with the fact that you can create your own rolls and put whatever you want in them. While this may mean it's a little bit of a slower pace, it's definitely worth the wait. 

You can choose white or brown rice, any kind of meat you want (crab, salmon, etc) and any veggies to go in it. Then they roll it up and cut it for you and you can pick your sauce. I get the sauce on the side and get two of them so I can switch it up, which they let you do for no extra charge. I think this set up makes it an excellent place for people who might not know what they like or who are a little wary of sushi. It's a great way to try different combos or new things!

Everyone I've encountered that works there seemed pretty friendly, but not overly so. They did their job and that was that. I definitely recommend giving this place a try next time you have a sushi craving (which, let's be honest, is probably all the time)!"}
{"text":"My husband and I needed a quick take out option and had been wanting to try enso. Since he's gluten free it can be difficult to find quick options but we were grateful to see they had several! We both had the Chicken bowl. I had it with the recommended tso sauce he had the spicy Thai. We loved both! Loved the freshness of the veggies and both sauces were full of taste, unlike some of the other Asian places we've visited.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is really not good or any type of authentic Asian food. The noodles are like spaghetti noodles and I really don't trust this sushi at all..."}
{"text":"This place is great! Always fresh and delicious. Very clean and staff is friendly! They have a wonderful selection to make customizable sushi right in front of you. I love it. Don't forget to get the wonton chips and wasabi hummus on the side. It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today off a recommendation from my husband's coworker.

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, he got a chicken rice bowl with general tso sauce and I had a beef noodle bowl with the enso sauce.

We liked the roll. Would give the roll a 3 star. The rice wasn't sticky enough to keep itself together. The tuna was ok but definitely over priced for the quality. Especially with a amazing sushi place up the road I can get a higher quality roll for less.

Husband gave his rice bowl a 4 out of 5. Could have used more chicken and was very dry. Needed more sauce. What sauce there was, was good.

I would give my noodle bowl a 4 out of 5 as well. It was good, decent amount of beef and I felt like there was enough sauce. The udon noodles were very good, would recommend trying them.

The interior environment I would give a 5. Nice modern and clean feel. Love the openness to the kitchen. You get to see them cook your bowl which is always fun."}
{"text":"Sushi is absolutely delicious! I love the fact that you can create your own and the portions are huge! A great place to get delicious and fresh sushi for a low price.
The wonton chips are great to eat alongside your roll :)"}
{"text":"First time didn't know what to expect. All i know is I was craving sushi. Walked in and loved the design of the place. Had a Chipotle vibe to it but for sushi and bowls of course. Service was awkward since it's teens working behind the counter and they lacked charisma and communication. Now to the food: sushi was decent. The seaweed however was very chewy and took me awhile to swallow. Again, teens made my sushi maybe they're new but definitely will try this place out again."}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever! I see why they barely get business! They don't know how to properly make sushi! Not authentic at all! The worker was annoyed with all the questions and they wasn't even business! Will never come back."}
{"text":"It's hard to explain this place without saying it is basically a Chipotle for sushi and American fusion Japanese food. You can either get a bowl or a roll. You pick your rice, protein, and toppings as you walk down the line. They have precut seaweed wraps and use a neat little slicer for cutting the roll into bite size sushi pieces. 

I'm easy and just stick with some of the premade combinations on the menu. Ingredients taste fresh and well kept. Veggies are crunchy and guac is tasty. You can pick a number of sauces at the end of your order to get on the side or on your roll/bowl. I have tried a few different sauces but keep coming back to the General Tso's. It's a particularly nice combination of sweet and salty that goes well with the sushi roll I get. 

I feel like the prices are a little higher than I would want, but you are also getting some ingredients that are normally reserved for more traditional sit down restaurants. Along with that, the sushi roll is more than a full meal, so I generally have some leftovers. Except, y'know, when I REALLY like the roll I got. 

If you're a big fan of sushi and can only eat the best, don't come here. People need to temper their expectations. This is a place where you can walk in, hand over $10, and walk out with a sushi roll. I'm perfectly okay with doing that once or twice a month for an easy and filling meal."}
{"text":"My first time at Enso Rolls and Bowls and it wasn't so good. The servers were nice but the bowls were nasty! My son and his friend had teriyaki lo mein noodles and chicken. The teriyaki sauce was gross. I had peanut sauce with lo main noodles and chicken. It was nasty. I think they use too much vegetable oil when cooking. My wife had the Philly roll and it was really good. The place is not kid friendly. I do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my nastiness. My husband and I had been wanting to try this for a while. I'm so so sorry that we finally did. Although I guess now we know...
We used the online ordering, which was very convenient. We each made our own bowl versus ordering the Chef Inspired dishes. I ordered lo mein with chicken, broccoli, carrots, asparagus, mushrooms, avocado and peanut sauce. The lo mein was literally spaghetti noodles. The asparagus was either picked too early or not fully cooked. It was stringy and tough. The avocado was definitely not fully ripened; my fork couldn't cut it. Everything else, while it didn't look bad, tasted CHARRED. 
There are of course foods that I don't like, and maybe I don't care for the way something is prepared. This has to be in the top 10 (bottom 10?) worst meals ever."}
{"text":"I have eaten here once and for fast Sushi I didn't have a problem with the food. This is a good alternative to picking up sushi at a local grocery store since you can actually create your own roll. Not restaurant quality, but good for what it is. The restaurant was clean, not crowded, and had easy seating.

I didn't have a problem with the taste of their fish/protein like other have commented. I actually prefer my sushi to not have much taste so I know it's fresh. I am also not huge of covering my sushi in sauces and mayo, but I did try some of their spicy mayo which wasn't bad. Although their sushi wasn't bad, the best item on the menu was the wasabi hummus with wonton pita chips. Hummus seems odd with sushi, but surprisingly worked really well. Enso gives a great portion size of hummus/chips for the price.

Overall pricing was what I expected, around $12 for sushi and hummus (no drink). Enso was fast and easy, but if you have the time to sit and wait you can get a better deal and quality with a lunch bento box at other local sit down sushi restaurants. I did not have their bowls, just sushi, so I can't comment on that part of the menu.

I'll be back to Enso if I need a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"Got the General To roll...about as flavorful as cardboard. This place has good intentions...but flavors   dumbed down to the point that it is tastless."}
{"text":"A unique experience of crafting your own Asian cuisine. I had the peanut noodle bowl with chicken and a side of the edamame salad. The vegetables in the bowl were crisp and fresh. The sauce was full of flavor and they put plenty on. It appears that they used a mix of white and dark meat for the chicken. The edamame salad had a great flavor and was loaded with corn, onions and peppers. 

My only complaint would be the fact that the food was cold when we got to the table. I was here for the Yelp event so I assume the large group of people caused the kitchen to rush the meals a bit. I would definitely come back to try it again."}
{"text":"Sushi is my favorite type of food in the world. I could eat it everyday if I could.  That being said, I was very excited about the concept of a Chipotle style sushi restaurant.  Even better: they have online ordering.  Perfect for my 1 hour lunch crunch.  I could order online, pick up my order, and get back to work on time.  I opted to make my own roll, and I tried the spicy crab and the salmon rolls with avocado and cucumber inside with spicy mayo on top.  I'm not sure if I got spicy crab, but at least the mayo was on top of the roll.  There was no spicy mayo on top of my salmon roll.  No big deal, but alas, ding 1.  I was handed my bag, and ding 2 happened.  I could smell the fish.  Good quality sushi should not smell fishy.  The salmon was overwhelmingly fishy in smell.  I tried one piece and ended up tossing the whole roll.  The crab roll was okay.  I say okay because there was hardly any crab in it (ding 3).  There were maybe 2-4 pieces that had a tiny bit of crab, but that was it.  That's immensely disappointing.  Lastly, the wasabi was..... strange.  I'm not too sure wasabi is supposed to have the consistency of play-doh, but it did.... ding 4.  I explained this experience to a colleague and she asked if I would go back.  My answer: maybe.  I recommend the experience and the concept, but not so much the execution.  This was my first experience here, and it was not the best at all.  Definitely needs improvement."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This has been on my list of places to try, and today was the day. I ordered a rice bowl with veggies and chicken, as well as the wonton chips with wasabi hummus.

The good: Wonton chips were excellent, and the hummus had a great flavor without the wasabi sting. Not spicy at all. The veggies were fresh and there was an array of different kinds to choose from.

The bad: There was barely any chicken in my chicken rice bowl. I got it and was like, 'um, didn't I order chicken?' That was what I said in my head, not out loud. When I finally found the chicken, it had gobs of fat on it. Why?!? Why can't you just cut off the huge, one inch piece of fat?!? One piece of 'chicken' in the bowl wasn't even chicken! It was just fat! Literally, a chunk of fat just hangin' out in my bowl. Also, something in my innermost self wants to say this was not fresh. It didn't taste fresh, and it had a processed-like consistency. Not only that, half the pieces were dark meat.

The downright ugly: I got the peanut sauce and it tasted nothing like peanuts. I mean, I really stretched to find that peanut taste. There wasn't even a hint of it. Closed my eyes and imagined peanuts. Nope. It could have also been the fact that the entire bowl tasted like a smoky griddle. Literally, it tasted like smoke. The dish was overpowered with a smoke flavor. Are you hearing me? It tasted like griddle smoke. Ok, I've made my point.

I am going to say that you might want to skip this place. In addition to the above, you leave smelling like smoke and $8 for a bowl with chunks of fat that taste like smoke is too expensive for my taste. Plus, it left my stomach really REALLY queasy. The aftermath was not pretty. Probably the griddle smoke."}
{"text":"Enso is delicious and very healthy but a bit on the expensive side. For the portion sizes, not the best value. However, some of the tastiest and healthiest food around."}
{"text":"Interesting fast casual restaurant. Some good veggie choices for your bowl and they stir fry it to order. The choice of sauces is great (we tried the sweet thai chili). A bit pricy if you compare to chipotle but still reasonable."}
{"text":"My very first sushi roll.   Having nothing to compare it to, but going on taste, texture, freshness, and appearance, I was pleased with the results.   

An overall 5 star experience, thanks to
 
1.  \"Chef inspired\" (on menu board) SPICY TUNA
      ROLL in NORI wrap, with white rice, cucumber, 
      avocado, and spicy mayo; wasabi crunch and 
      teriyaki sauce, too.  Neither nori (seaweed) nor 
      tuna were strong-tasting, but mild and nicely
      flavored. 
2.  The neat, clean, attractive, and simply-designed 
      interior; check out the cool silver aluminum 
      chairs...probably weigh less than 3 pounds 
      each...I want a few of them, myself.
3.  What I felt was reasonable pricing.
4.  Helpful, efficient Sherri and Katie.  I especially 
      like getting complimentary sides of warm, 
      friendly smiles with anything I order from food 
      spots.

My holdout in sampling sushi centers around an incident that's taken me about 15 years to get over, and one you'll appreciate that I'm not relating here.  It was time I ventured beyond raw oysters from restaurants and rare tuna steaks from my kitchen.   

Being pretty particular about how foods are prepared and the end results, the Spicy Tuna roll actually looked and tasted very good.  Loved the interesting texture, but I'm undecided about the \"concept\" of sushi .  The fish was perfectly fine and close to my quickly seared steaks at home, and I really enjoyed the chewy yet tender seaweed, but it's the COLD RICE element that I'm not so sure about.  Because I liked everything, I may try making my own COOKED and WARM version (tushi? hehe) using the same ingredients.  I want to come up with some way to use that distinctively different nori.  

Their Garlic & Teriyaki Edamame side.   Never had it this way, but it was served whole---in their firm, inedible pods.  I don't know if this is authentic/traditional, but I definitely prefer eating the beans without them.  Probably steamed or boiled, then tossed in oil, garlic, and teriyaki, they require splitting with your fingers or utensils, or---in order to taste the garlic and teriyaki---putting the 2\" pod into your mouth, then pulling it as the naturally mild beans slip out.  Maybe fine in the privacy of your own home...haha...but as that pile of translucent, stringy, emptied pods increases
---while seated among other diners---not so much.   Edamame are expensive, so the serving size would be quite small, but Enso's should consider offering just the beans---without pods---tossed in those great seasonings.  4.5 stars for flavor alone---excluding the required method of dispensing...heehee...and the 
off-putting visual.  no-o-o. 

~~~
It's obvious that poor Enso's doesn't deserve a number of those low star reviews.  Eliminating the illogical and mean-spirited from the equation, I'd re-adjust their average to at least 4 stars, maybe 4.5.  

Ridiculously petty, even absurd issues, such as music choice...not enough sauce.  duh.  never thought to ask for more?...not trusting younger employees with raw food?  Astute.  How true...the older they are, the more careful and cleaner they are...and other goofy reasons, too, none of which stopped me from visiting.   Instead of learning about Enso's, one can learn more about the characters and intelligence levels of some reviewers.          

So, to be fair to Enso's---and other restaurants, too---rather than quickly scanning, use your noodle and take time reading those negative reviews, paying particular attention to the REASONS for low ratings.  Before readily accepting, and leaning toward not visiting a location, ask yourself, \"Does this really make any sense?\" ...  \"Was that just meant to be nasty?\"  I guarantee that you'll pick up sarcasm, exaggeration, and even sheer stupidity, too, from some harsh, extreme reviews. 

And ALWAYS be wary and distrustful of any FIRST REVIEWS of 3 STARS OR LESS for newly-opened restaurants.   Hell, these are NEW spots---they need room to breathe, for goodness sake.  Smart, considerate diners will excuse shortcomings and not even bother writing nasty \"firsts\".  But those with vindictive jealous streaks can't wait to be the \"first to review\" and make mad dashes to their keyboards.  Pathetic.

Disregard any comments dissing employees by stating---or even suggesting---that they're not seasoned, experienced sushi \"artists\".   What?  This is a friendly, clean **FAST FOOD JOINT**.   They're doing their best to serve quick, affordable, raw and cooked, fresh, authentic and Americanized Asian dishes---all this, in a SUBURBAN SHOPPING CENTER.  (I guess those reviewers didn't notice the Target, Lowe's, Original Pancake House---and the thousand parking spaces.)  This isn't a $30-$35 a roll / 5-bucks-a-bite $$$ sushi bar in uptown Manhattan or downtown Tokyo.  It's Westgate.

Just visit Enso's.  It might become a new favorite."}
{"text":"This is a fast food place, this is a fast food place, this is a fast food place. As long as you keep telling yourself that, you won't be too disappointed. Think of this as Japanese style Chipotle. 
I tried a bowl rather than a roll on my first visit as I was not impressed with the people making the food... aka, they did not seem to be skilled sushi chefs (they were, however, very friendly!)
The end product was just \"eeh.\" I think the problem was that all the components are cooked separately with no flavors so they can be incorporated into may different dishes with the flavor added separately. This results is very flavorless chicken, noodles, and veggies with a bit of your choice of sauce on it. Only after I added Siracha sauce, did the bowl have flavor, and then it was just Siracha flavored. 
Bowls were a little pricey but no more than Piada or Chipotle - but I like the food better at those other places so it makes it more worth the price. 
Unfortunately, I don't think I will be back unless my fellow Yelpers tell me that something has improved."}
{"text":"Place is located in a strip mall but didn't prejudge. It's a very clean, modern looking inside with the cutest little statues of Buddha babies scattered throughout the place in different emotions making for interesting photo ops. Plenty of table seating and even a community bench where you can sit down next to someone and meet a friend.

Must highlight how awesome the staff was: Each and every individual seemed genuinely interested to help no matter what their role. Each pleasant and friendly including the manager who was right up in the front lines of serving the food. 

So the gist of this place is like an Asian chipotle. Go down a row choosing which items you want to include in your entrée. First choice: do you want sushi roll or a bowl. I picked the bowl option. Then choose if you want rice versus noodles. Next choose proteins: shrimp, salmon, chicken etc. Then a variety of vegetables and lastly what kind of sauce you want this concoction to be sautéed in. My ultimate custom bowl was salmon sautéed with mushrooms, onions, broccoli in their namesake sauce (Enso sauce which I would describe as a soy sauce base with some spicy and sweet), atop brown rice with a side of some shredded crab. 

The meal was good, wouldn't venture to say outstanding. Unfortunately this is a far drive for me and the food was not worth the drive."}
