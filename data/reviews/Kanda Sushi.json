{"text":"Kanda does not have a large variety on their lunch menu. However, in the evening they have a larger variety to choose from.  Service is always quick and the waiters are attentive and polite.  The reason I gave it a three star is because my favorite dish ( salt and pepper squid) was overcooked and cold. A bit pricy considering you can the same variety at lunch at Sushi St. Jean.  The sauce on the general Tao tasted like the sweet and sour sauce from a bottle but the chicken was good and crispy.  The sushi was fresh and well presented."}
{"text":"Service was aweful, worst ever. The waiters and manager were rude and blamed us for not ordering correctly after we told them that we repeatedly asked for service that never came. They kept rushing us and purposely kept mixing our orders and blamed us that it was our fault. The sushi was poorly made and tasteless. They made us pay without completing our order. Then made us reorder after we told them we're simply not paying. Food came in worst and sloppy -we definitely got a good laugh with how bad it came out. Never coming back in this place."}
{"text":"Great food with a good amount of variety, the staff were friendly and the place had a good atmosphere. The food and the service has improved since last time we are here. We will definitely being going back"}
{"text":"Il n'accepte pas débit et vous force a utiliser leur machine atm pour retiré de l'argent avec des frais de 3.25$ et ils m'ont forcé à donner du tip car selon lui il n'en avait pas assez et il m'a dit que c'était pour le gouvernement. Pendant se temps les 10 employés me regardais donc je me suis sentie obligé de donner plus de tip."}
{"text":"Embarassing :(
We ordered the 100 piece for 85$ + an extra 30 pieces of avocado on a phone call for pick up about 2 hours later,  we were 30 min late to come get it. I think they just left it on the counter in a bag the whole time instead of a fridge, or they gathered older pieces and threw them into our order, because the rice was hard and crunchy while others overly soft, and the avocado was brown instead of green. Maybe they thought we were not going to complain since it was take out? BITCH! I'M COMPLAINING!

Now, I've ordered sushi from other places before, left it in my own fridge overnight, and it was still yummy the next day. That is why I feel something funny happened with this order, because the rice was hard for alot of pieces, while others were too soft. Kamakazee was soft, no flavor in everything, and avocado was brown and blotchy instead of a healthy green. 

The only thing that was good, was the pickled ginger and the fact that their little cups of soy sauce was actually enough for each person. And they gave plenty of ginger and wasabe. All this is where they earned their 1 point rating I'm forced to give them.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big sushi expert. I frequent all-you-can-eat sushi, so I know what to expect. I was always a big fan of Kanda's back when they were near Fairview. I looked online and saw they were the cheapest for take out on large orders, so tried them out on their sources location. Very sad.

This was supose to be a surprise for my sister, who just delivered a baby, and didn't want to go out yet. She's been craving sushi for a year lol and... this was what we brought her lol she barely touched it... and was too polite to complain. She is not a sushi expert either, since she use to adore coming with us to these cheap all you can eat sushi places...

This was bad.
Very, very bad.
I have not tried this locations' indoor all-you-can-eat, but I'm scared to now. They don't seem to care. Well... fk you too then, right?"}
