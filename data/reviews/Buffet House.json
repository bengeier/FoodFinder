{"text":"My boyfriend, his partially disabled mother and I decided to have a late lunch here today (around 3 pm) as we have dined here many times before and enjoyed it very much in the past. However, today's experience has not only made us decide not to eat here again, but has also compelled me to inform others about our experience here today.

It was apparent the restaurant was in the process of being remodeled upon our arrival and when we first walked through the door, we had a feeling things might be different there, and not for the better. The man who \"greeted\" us tried to seat us at a booth in the corner, rather than our usual and preferred table in the front. Note: the restaurant was completely empty at this point and it is difficult for my boyfriend's mother to get around. Also due to her disability, sitting at a booth is very difficult for her,  thus our request for this certain table. The man started insisting we take the booth however we were eventually seated at our table of preference.  At this point, we recognized that something was definitely wrong here, and we questioned the man in regards to whether or not the restaurant was under new ownership. He told us \"No\" and sat down at a table and began eating. 

I picked up a plate and went straight to the section of the buffet where the sushi is (usually) located. The sushi buffet trays were completely empty, except fpr a couple of picked over pieces that looked like they had been sitting there for a few hours. At this time, my boyfriend had begun looking for items for his mother and himself in the hot foods section. The selection was disappointing as well to say the least. The seafood looked over-cooked, yet cold, and smelled fishy. The hot and sour soup was lukewarm and tasted like spicy chicken noodle soup. At this point we asked the man that had orignally seated us if he could please provide extra sauce for the dried up coconut shrimp, which had never been a problem by the previous owners in the past. The man replied \"No!\" and went back to eating his food. So then we politely requested if they could make some fresh california rolls, at the very least, to which he responded, \"I eating lunch!\". We had to go knock on, and eventually open, the \"employees only\" door and ultimately shout for someone to please come help us at the sushi area. After we had asked a few different people a few different times for assistance, finally someone came out and replenished the sushi trays. By this time, more people started coming into the restaurant. Obviously they started to realize the imminent need to provide additional, fresh items to the buffet and it was then that the selection slightly improved. The man finished eating his lunch and began walking around checking on the buffet trays. We asked him again if the restaurant was under new ownership and this time he confirmed our suspicions that yes, there are now new owners. We assumef that he is probably part of the new ownership, based on his poor attitude and his reluctacy to admit the changes to management and its relation to the decline in the restaurant's quality. 

When we decided we'd had enough and requested the check, we were unpleasantly surprised that we had been charged the dinner rate, despite the fact that we arrived during lunch hours. 

We are now mourning the loss of our once favorite chinese buffet restaurant, while nursing our nausea symptoms

***update: well im definitely convinced theres some kind of conspiracy going on here. .. my review, as well as 2 others that recently gave the buffet house one star ratings, were conveniently \"filtered\" out from the other reviews by yelp. Yelp, do you not want your readers to get the honest truth on this place? Its quality has seriously gone downhill and our fellow patrons need to know! Get rid of the filter... you are doing others a disservice by making it more complicated to read these reviews that you \"randomly selected\" to hide errr... i mean \"filter\"."}
{"text":"My friend  told me .the sushi is delicious and food same to I vacation here  , then , I  like here. I hope more people like here . I hope the Buffet House  very busy."}
{"text":"Buffet house, amazing! You got everything here. Chinese, American, and my favor sushi! I love it! And it is close to where I work!! They run a special offer right now: 10% off for lunch and 15% off for dinner. I will tell all my friends!!!"}
{"text":"Really a great selection and good quality. The service was good and I ended up having a great meal for under 15 dollars. I will definitely return back."}
{"text":"It was okay for what it is. I'd rather get takeout at a Chinese place where the food is a little bit better, but if you're looking for a sit down Chinese buffet, you should try it out. They're running a special right now to get new customers in the door, so it was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Terrible food! Beware!! The food was really bad. I have been to a lot of Chinese restaurants, this one is undoubtedly the worst of all. Food was prepared with s**t load of MSG, so people allergic to MSG please avoid this place. The fried rice and noodles was pathetic. Except 2 or 3 dishes which were okay. Rest of the dishes were so grease and prepared with frozen stuff. even the desserts were bad. Had a very bad experience. I went with 10 of my friends, all felt the same too."}
{"text":"Buffet House, what an odd name!  I've been jonesing for a Chinese buffet near work and finally, FINALLY, one has sprung up.  And it's good!

Stopped in with my co-worker, Mark, on his last day with our company to have some lunch.  We thought we would try this place because it is relatively new and one of our co-workers was raving about it.  So off we went.

When we first walked in, we heard elevator Christmas music.  Mark said, 'Is that Christmas Music I hear?\"  And I laughed and said, \"Why yes it is!\"  It's Christmas in September for me because I found a new favorite place to eat on my lunch breaks.

The food was solid and the price for lunch was very reasonable.  It was $14.00 for both of us!

My favorite entree was the Coconut Shrimp.  It was sweet, plump, and delicious.  I had at least two servings!

I have to compare this restaurant to Double Dragon Buffet, in Parma Heights because their offerings are almost identical.  I still need to taste everything at Buffet House to make it official, but on my initial visit I would say it's not as good as Double Dragon, but it is very close.  Double Dragon has had many more years to hone and refine its offerings.

Back to Buffet House.  I really hope people start eating here often so it stays in business.  I need this place to be here.  I need to eat here, often.  Go here.  Keep their doors open.  Consume delicious Chinese food!

Their sushi was decent, actually, which was surprising.  All the entrees looked good, but they don't put a large quantity of food out because there are not many frequenters yet and they don't want to be wasteful.  Hopefully, one day, that will change.  I took a couple menus and passed them on to my co-workers in the hopes that they will fall in love with Buffet House.

{"text":"First, you should know that though this restaurant has a menu, virtually everyone eats the lunch or dinner buffet.  This buffet is really large and includes most of the standard Chinese fair as well as fish, clams, mussels, sushi and even crawfish as well as 4 types of asian soups and 2 non-asian.  There were some basic items that I believe could be better such as the vegetable fried rice and the lomein noodles which were chewy and sticky and the eggroll which was dry and bland as well as the dumplings.  But many of the shrimp and chicken meals were tasty and the green beans were as good as I've ever had and my sons both loved the coconut shrimp.  The crab rangoon was crispy and sweet.  They had a nice selection of fruits and desserts including very yummy donuts and, much to my children's delight, even ice cream.  The adult dinner buffet cost was $10 which is 15% off the standard price of $11.50.  Since they've opened they've been running that special and i think its a good value for the money, but I'm hoping they will make some improvements in the food quality."}
