{"text":"I've been to this place for  quite sometime now and I find it very busy especially on the weekends. I tried their chicken and I can say it is one of the best I've ever tasted. The pansit also is mouth watering and the kare-kare is worth the drive.

The place is a little bit small considering that a lot of people goes there for lunch or dinner. The ambiance is quite off. The crews are great and very helpful."}
{"text":"i am very disappointed with the service. i waited 45 minutes for 3 orders. and take note its \"take out\". the crew are running around cos there are a lot of people. well every crew has to have there own station. and the receptionist is out of sight. there were still people coming in and waiting to be sitted. but the receptionist is inside the kitchen making orders. management sucks. not organized at all. people are waiting, orders are not taken in time. like seriously???? its not an excuse that you are busy and helping others. you panic because you are not organized. not really worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed after eating there. First off, I understand the wait is long for me we waited 30-45 minutes of course its going to be a long wait they just opened. That wasn't the problem. The service was good, our server she was amazing our host was kind and everyone apologize for the wait. Cleanliness wasn't too great, slow at busing the tables around us. 

My major problem was the food. I've tried Max's before but that was in the Philippines so my expectations were high. We ordered Fiesta platter and Max's Platter it came to our table fairly quickly maybe about less than 20 minutes. Now I know why, it was cold! My mom thought that maybe it was just hers and the fact that we just had halo halo (which was good you cant mess up halo halo right?), no my sister's food was cold also so was mine. the only thing that was hot was the chicken and it wasnt impressive. Maybe they need more practice or training or what have you, but I do know we won't be going back since my mom got sick after eating there. Save yourself time, just go to DT's so much better."}
{"text":"The staff is very very nice. The service was excellent. The food was just not  spectacular...We had appetizer sunflower deep fried, it was ok for an appetizer but felt undercooked. Then my husband had telapia fish that was supposed to be spicy and beside the hot red little pepper on top there was nothing spicy about that dish. I had milk fish that I had to put aside after one bite, the waiter said it traditional fish so it is probably just me, but he was nice and did not charge me for it.:)"}
{"text":"Max's restaurant is good.
Food is okay.
The macaroni and cheese (from the kiddie menu) is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place. It has amazing, traditional filipino cuisine, as close to authentic as you can get. The portions are meant to be shared, so bring a hungry friend. The chicken is what they are known for and it's amazing. Crispy skin but very tender,juicy meat. Much better than Swiss Chalet/Kfc/Popeye's. The pancet is great and has lots of meat and vegtables with just the right spices. The halo-halo is heavenly and huge so save room for dessert. The Shanghi is full of pork but portion wise it's probably the smallest portion item they have on the menu. They serve Jasmine white rice which goes great with their recipes. You're going to be full at the end of the meal. The atmosphere is kinda like a cross between old school Mcdonald's and a 70's filipino american diner. Very clean, bathrooms are great for fast food decor. You'll see what I mean when you go there. So why the 4 stars instead of 5?
This is why:
-1/2 star because:
Although the chicken is quite good, it is very pricey and small. My wife and kids finished a chicken by themselves, it was that good but also that small. To explain why this is important, they can barely finish half a whole chicken from Swiss Chalet. 

-1/2 star because:
I think everything is made to order so that slows service down a lot. Expect to wait for most of your main course items. The apps come out fast but there's a long wait after that for your food. Keep in mind the wait is worth it so patience is a virtue here. 

Even if you're not filipino or have not had filipino food, this is truely a taste of the philiipines that you have to experince at least once in your life. My suggestions for those not familiar with filipino cuisine.

Start with these:
Chicken
Shanghi
Pancet
Rice"}
{"text":"We ordered of course their famous max fried chicken, nilagang baka with patis and sili , pata tim, and garlic rice"}
{"text":"To make a long review short, we (group of 8 people) were very satisfied with the food and especially the service! The food came out fast and it was just as good as the Max's in the Philippines! The Daing na Bangus was so good! AND THE FRIED CHICKEN. So good!"}
{"text":"Very very bad, lazy, slow service. 

The servers took an hour for our food to come to us. 

On top of that, their floor were very dirty with a lot of spills on the floor. Tables were not clean upon arrival and still not done (30 min in our stay) 

TERRIBLE. AVOID THIS PLACE. SERVICES SUCKS.

Over an hour and still no food

And I have no cutlery or napkins. No NOTHING. So terrible. 

There is hardly any staff here working. Just two servers/cashiers. 

Our server was very rude and had a very sarcastic tone towards my family. Very impolite."}
{"text":"I've dined at Max's in Glendale, Ca a few times. I was ecstatic to hear of an opening in Las Vegas. I had my mind set on eating Max's Beef Caldereta (dish served at Max's in Glendale, Ca) with Garlic Rice.  Unfortunately, its not served at this location. This location is just serving the basics.

I had the Chicken Sigsig, a Whole Chicken, Garlic Rice and the Halo-Halo. 

The Chicken Sigsig lacked flavor. It tasted like mayo mixed with day old chicken and slices of jalapeno. For a better tasting Sigsig , I recommend dining at Cafe Moda.

The Whole Chicken was moist and tender. I enjoyed crunching on the crispy chicken skin. Though, I still don't know what the hype is over the chicken's flavor. My guess it lacked in this chicken.

The Garlic Rice was good. 

Lastly, I ordered the Halo-Halo. Delicious! The best in all Las Vegas.

The wait staff were polite and friendly.

By the way, don't ask for water. Its tap unfiltered hard water. Ask for bottled water.

In conclusion, the food is bland and lacks authentic flavor and the menu items are over priced. I wouldn't come back for the entrees until Max's Beef Caldereta is put on the menu to try.  For now I'll continue to dine at Max's in Glendale, CA. However, I will come back for the Halo-Halo.

My recommendation for this Max's is to lower the prices (especially when the food is not that good and you are just starting out) and serve authentic food."}
{"text":"Worse crispy chicken bad name for manila max restaurant.whoever is the cook needs to be sent back to manila for schooling at max resto."}
{"text":"I avoid a lot of fried foods, so don't ask me about the chicken, lol!  Have been here a couple of times. Had the spring rolls and one of the stir fry meat dishes and it was great.

Was only disappointed about the service.  It is indeed very slow, as another reviewer mentioned.  And this was on a quiet mid weeknight with the place almost empty.  But they seem to keep fairly busy with takeout orders too, so that may explain it (partially)."}
{"text":"Not quite what I expected. Was expecting some authentic food, but even their speciality fried chicken was not the best. However, we did enjoy the live DJ/Entertainment. Overall it was a So-so experience."}
{"text":"I have no negative comment about the food because I grew up with Max's. I highly recommend the chicken, Kare kare and lechon kawali. Halo halo tastes very well for its price.
It's the service that I'm very concerned about. There seems to be not enough people to handle the demand. The staff are all friendly and nice but all look frazzled. You enter the place and you will wait forever to get seated. Then you look at empty tables that takes forever to get cleared. Then you're seated and it takes forever to order. So now your food arrives then some stuff are missing like a bowl for sinigang, Alamang for your kare kare, or napkins that you shouldn't have to ask for. And yes, it takes forever to wait for someone to assist you. We've been here a dozen times and a dozen times we have to find another place to eat because of the wait time. Max's, that's a lost revenue for you. The only reason why I give out tips inspite of the bad service is out of concern for the staff. Hope you'll improve, Max's."}
{"text":"We come here with family, and when we do we go all out. From their famous chicken, down to their crispy and satisfying pork sisig! Located on Flamingo and Maryland parkway, a bit of a drive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here again around a month ago. love this place. To be fair I haven't tried a ton of Filipino food, I went to Tinuno downtown Toronto, and a couple of other food stalls but the food and atmosphere here is amazing.

It's a little pricey for the portions you get but I would come here again in a heart beat. The sisig was my favourite dish.

A little loud but there was a birthday gathering so I can't really blame the restaraunt for this one. 

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Right when I got my water there was lipstick stain on it. I lost my appetite afterwards."}

Found several metal particles from scrubs in my beef broth and my wife plate we found a hair , I have been i the restaurant business for a very long time a I know mistakes happens , but we couldn't eat anymore for 24 hours , we ask for spicy sauce and there's not a spicy sauce ether , I'm sorry :(  for my bad review ."}
{"text":"Decided to have my daughter's first birthday here a couple of days ago but man, we were beyond disappointed. We booked for 30 pax, paid extra $140 for the decorations and table setting (pictures shown to us were definitely amazing, formal setting and impressive setup) but on the day of the party, we were shortchanged! Tables were not set up yet (we got there an hour before the party to make sure all was set up right and to arrange the cake and lootbags) and it was a total mess! They said they were short staffed and our guests even helped arranged the tables! Balloon arch was impressive but that was it?! Really disappointing to think that the tablecloths used were like scraps of fabric they had to tape on the table.. nothing like the pictures shown to us. Mygod, if they cannot handle a party, they shouldve not accepted the task in the first place. Thankfully the one-woman team Ms Marilyn was a multitasker but her efforts are just not enough to start the party on time and serve the food. A young cashier doesnt even know how to handle money and kept on calling Ms Marilyn while she was hosting the party. We should've known better, with all the negative reviews here in yell, but decided to give them a chance and trusted the name Maxs, which is known for quality Filipino food inthe Philippines but certainly not in Canada. I wouldnt be surprised if they close down anytime soon. So disappointed but guests still have a great time. Overall it's not worth the money. If you're planning to have your party here, go with other options. It's just not worth it!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Max Fried Chicken in a long time.  This one is clean with a semi-quiet ambience.  I don't see why the chicken is special. The rest of the food,  nilagang baka, kare-kare, fried rice, crispy pata, was real tasty.  Service was average.  Our waiter was quiet. Receptive to our needs."}
{"text":"We had my mom's 70th birthday here last night. We had such a great time. Perfect place for party. They have a private room for us. We had about 40 ppl. The catering person Gerose was so helpful during the booking and during our event. The food was delicious. We highly recommend booking your party here."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait time. I realize they opened about a week ago but you would think business would be running smoothly by now."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK HERE!!!

I've been a loyal customer of Max's restaurant ever since I was a kid. Our family has a tradition of eating here after going to mass when were still in the Philippines, so I know the detail and it's authentic taste. But after our bad experience here in the 1st Max restaurant in Toronto, I am sure I will never go back here.
First, VERY POOR SERVICE. We waited for an hour just to have our seat then another hour for our food. And take note, while waiting to be seated, we are just standing inside the restaurant to think that there's plenty of chairs to seat! They said...no waiter will serve us!
Second, OVERPRICED. There food is so expensive. A small chicken cost a lot!
Third, I am craving for lumpiang sariwa so when I ordered I thought it's available because it takes forever for the waiter to come back, he came back saying that the lumpiang sariwa is no longer available! It sucks!
Well, I hope they will improve their service and their food for future customers! Kasi tawasin mo man ako....I will never go back here!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for Filipino food!!

This location is the best Max's Restaurant I've been to: Nice ambiance, neat decor and clean, friendly and attentive service, and great tasting food. Everyone is so nice!! If you are new to Filipino food or just want a really good sit-down Filipino lunch/dinner, this is the place for you!

My favorites:
1. Fried Chicken - Light crispiness all around. An original recipe that you will love. Eat with banana sauce (available upon request).
2. Daing na Bangus - Boneless milkfish. It is thick and flaky -- better than the one at Salo-Salo Grill, not to mention other Filipino food places.
4. Bangus Sisig - Sizzling boneless milkfish in a flavorful vinegar sauce with onions and ginger.
5. Garlic Rice

SKIP the:
1. Spaghetti - A huge portion (enough for 2), but not really memorable. Sauce was just 'ok.'

Maybe try:
1. Tapsilog (marinated sirloin strips with eggs and garlic rice) - Good too, but tastes a lot like Korean BBQ...i.e., it's sweeter, and doesn't taste like the usual Tapa dish.. Only get this if you are feeling a sweeter beef, like Korean BBQ.

Portions are huge and heavy (you're eating this with rice, after all), so just get 1 dish per person. Be sure to come hungry and just return to try other dishes.

We will definitely be returning....again and again!"}
{"text":"First impressions: 
a nice MAX ambiance with OPM on the background. A group of 8+2k visit for Sun lunch.  Lumpiang Shanghai came in 10mins. Within 20 mins, other 7 dishes came.  70% seating capacity filled.  Three men ate enough portions. Bicol Epress n Bangus Sisig are good. Food portions are ok @ $20 each."}
{"text":"WHAT A RIP OFF !!! 

Terrible...Horrible...Unleasant experience !!!

Came to visit Canada from the US and got so excited to dine at Max. Food was FINE. Staff was great, I give them a score of 10, being the highest. HOWEVER, however, the price was way over the roof. I'm not a rich, wealthy Filipino, but I work hard to enjoy the pleasures of life. THE ÜBE Cake and Sans Rival was a total RIP OFF . How in the world can you price one slice of the cake that high? ( YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT, ONE SLICE )   How? A slice of Ube cake was ( and prolly still is ) priced $18.00 each, and the Sans rival at $17.50 . !!! That's equal or more than one meal, ! WTF ! They are 50 to 75 % higher than most of my desserts from a 5 Star hotel , even over...way over than my most drooling Godiva cheesecake . 

MAX, You got to think this through and re price your so-called special dessert . The menu is DECEIVING too. They put the ÜBE dessert at $5 or $6 but that is not the same you see in the glass show case at the entrance, mind you there aren't prices at showcase. ($18 and $17.50, etc ) . What's on the menu is like an Ube Flan or Cream, not a cake. it's a sham !!! 

They really thought over their goal---and that is the ULTIMATE DECEPTION !!!"}
{"text":"We were in search for good Filipino cuisine. Based upon the good review from the SEVEN Magazine, we decided to give them a try.

It was a little mystery to find out where exactly the door was. However, with a little help from someone directing us to the door we finally made it in. 

Although I am an avid tea drinker, I was left a tea bag with my daughter to show us the type of iced tea they have. By the way when does ice tea get served in a bag. definitely a miscommunication, an odd presentation indeed.

Based upon the menu being Filipino, when trying to order shanghai lumpia I was told they didn't have any. I attempted to clarify further with the server to find out if they are not served or ran out. The server responded, \" It's eighty-six.\"

Cutting straight to the food, egg pansit, beef stew and asparagus eggplant tofu were all grossly salty. I thought for sure my blood pressure rose 100 percent. All entries overall lacked flavor and had a very unhealthy overtone. 

I would not recommend this place anyone! We  left to Firefly and finished up an fabulous dinner there!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed on Saturday night. There was plenty of parking at the plaza.  The restaurant was well lit and clean. We waited over half an hour and decided to take out instead. The fried chicken was good and the pancit bihon was as expected- stir fried with vegetables. I will go back next time for lunch and try the chicken adobo. Hopefully, it won't be as busy."}
{"text":"I really like this Filipino restaurant. They are very famous in the Philippines. The place is usually full of Filipino expatriates getting a taste of home, but don't be intimidated. I have been there twice and tried two different but delicious fried chicken platters that also come with delicious garlic rice and dessert (ice cream or a small bar). They also have some banana ketchup that  tastes really good on my fried chicken. Not sure if that is what you are supposed to do, but that is what I did. The restaurant also has a trendy remodeled interior; just don't try to sit next to the door on a cold day. They also have free parking in the strip mall, but for some reason people don't plow lots in Toronto properly so a few spots are always piled with snow."}
{"text":"This is perhaps my 3rd or 4th visits.  I like the restaurant and certainly has the authentic feeling of being in Manila.

Despite of some reviews of 'slow' service, I have always had my food on time with no delay.

During my recent visit, the name of my food server is 'Jhun' and he was quite prompt, polite and knowledgeable about the menu.

We have ordered 'Pinakbet', Chicken Adobo, Garlic Fried Rice, Steamed Rice, respectively plus Halo Halo for dessert and coffee.  Overall, the food was good.  

CONS:

1)  WIFI is available but would not allow restaurant patrons to use.  Quite a challenge for patrons of Generation X, who has the disposable income to spare but restaurant owner seem to be neglecting.

2)  Can be a bit noisy during busy hour.  With the typical loud music of Filipino artists plus the various conversations with no curtain to muffle the sound, one can hardly have a conversation."}
{"text":"This is the first time visiting Max's restaurant as well as eating Filipino food.  The hostess greeted us, asked if we had any questions.  We were not sure what to order but the hostess gave her suggestions and she was right!  She suggested the pork belly & shrimp sinagang (spelling??) which has a sour tomato base broth, which was very tasty, especially when I do not prefer sour foods.  We also had bihon pancit with vegetables, chicken, pork and shrimp, as well as garlic rice.  There was garlic in every bite and it was heaven!  I definitely enjoyed my first time here, from the gracious hostess, to the attentive server, but most of all the very tasty good!  Definitely will come back whenever we visit Las Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"My friend and I like to go to new restaurants and try new types of food.  We went to Max's for the first time Monday evening at about 5:00 p.m.  The place was clean, bright and aesthetically lovely. The hostess was gracious and seated us right away.  We were seated by the fireplace. Next to the fireplace were two vases of lovely flowers.  We were waited on within minutes.  Our waiter was patient with us explaining the different dishes as we are Americans with no knowledge of the cuisine.  We ordered noodle soup as an appetizer, chicken and a noodle dish (which I cannot pronounce) as an entree.  The food was delicious. The chicken was tender.  My only thought is that the food was not piping hot. Other than that, I enjoyed the restaurant and the food, and will definitely return.  I see a lot of comments that service was lacking.  They've obviously worked out their kinks as the service we received was excellent."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered the following:
Chicken - amazing
Sizzling tofu - ok at first but then it became too rich because of the mayo.
Fried rice - amazing
karekare - good
Palabok - good
halo-halo - amazing
lechon baboy/roast pig with sarsa - ok

Service is not so good.  The waitress asked us 3 times what we ordered. I asked for no ice on my water but she gave it to us with ice. I didn't bother correcting her because we waited over 30 minutes for our water.  

No sure why gratitude $$$ is automatically added to our bill.  it should be based on the service."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service... not so much. Your server may forget you for 30 mins.  The Kare Kare is a must try.  Max's fried chicken is the envy of fried chicken everywhere.   Find a filipino friend and ask them to come along to navigate the menu.  If you can't find a filipino to bring with you, just ask the server what the most popular dishes.  You really can't go wrong with any of the traditional filipino specialties.  My faves are the Kare Kare (beef stew), Lumpiang Shanghai, Sinigang (Tamarind Soup) and Lechon Kawali (Crispy Pork)."}
{"text":"Good eats and good service! The food tastes as authentic as it can get with being a Filipino food place. It was my second time being here and it was just as good as the first time. 
Portions were perfect and taste was better than previous places that I've been to.
Mabuhay, Max's Restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's a very nice filipino restaurant, if that's the reason you would go to any restaurant is the \"prettiness\" then this is the place to go. If your looking for good Filipino food then I wouldn't recommend this place. I expect any Asian restaurants food to taste better or at least just as good as I cook. I'm not the best cook but OMG so much better than this place. This was a big fail. Not only was it overpriced for mediocre bland food the so called \"family style servings\" (really) was only a 2 person serving, 1 person if that's all you were gonna eat. I enjoy the smaller more simple filipino restaurants as their food tastes better and are more realistically priced. Yes you pay more here for the ambiance understandably so. Well after all they do have to price food to balance out costs, labor and rent I assume. I was so excited to try their beef sisig ($13) as it came sizzling on a small iron platter. Ugh but much to my dismay it had a hint of curry flavor and what looks to be a bit of mayo or some kind of white cream mixed with the chopped beef, onions and jalepenos. Don't get me wrong I enjoy eating curry but not what I expected when I thought sisig. I wanted more of a tang, I even squeezed the lemon wedges on it and it didn't help the flavor any. The pancit canton was so so just on flavor I didn't like the noodles as it tasted like they used the dried package canton noodles. Would've been much much better if they'd use fresh noodles. The palabok was bland, the spaghetti was no different than jufran sauce with a tiny bit of grd meat. The only thing I came close to enjoying was their fried chicken. They must use small filipino chickens tho. The staff is pleasant and although our server was very nice it doesn't make up for the fact that he just wasn't a good server. He took our order and brought our food. Those were the only 2 times he came on his own. We had to flag him down to ask for our sodas to be refilled and find him yet again to get our check. I must mention they weren't at at all busy and we were his 2nd table in the area. Oh and really what's the deal with the worcestershire sauce and tabasco on the tables c'mon it's a Filipino restaurant for goodness sake. I understand the jufran being there but where's the patis and spicy vinegar?"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at 11:30 am excited about eating some delicious Filipino food but were incredibly disappointed. We were seated quickly and asked for a seat near the fireplace. Two large family parties and an elderly couple came in after us, but received service before us. They obviously need to train their staff better. We advised management of the horrible service and left. Hopefully they learn from this mistake."}
{"text":"Very limited menu. Food was good and service was great. They are only open for dinner. Everything is also al a carte. The prices are a bit high too. There are other places in town that I will go for Filipino food."}
{"text":"Their food never disappoints. Brought my non-Filipino friends here and they loved every single food they ordered. Service has a tremendous improvement compared to the time when they have just opened. 

One huge improvement that their staff need is to NEVER assume that every single person that will dine here speaks Tagalog. I am perfectly fluent in Tagalog but I was obviously here with two people who speaks zero Tagalog and it was very obvious throughout our whole conversation BUT our server keeps talking to all of us in Tagalog even when I already told him that I am the only Filipino in the crew and even though I keep responding to all of his Tagalog questions in English just so we don't sound rude in front of my friends. 

Other than that, this place will give you a good Filipino fine dining experience at very decent prices. I've been to almost every Filipino place in the valley and with all different factors considered, I will still put Max's on top of my list."}
{"text":"Max's is ok. It took 10 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted. The waitress kinda knew about the menu. The menu was not banging but it filled me up. The credit card machine went down which was a bummer, but the waitress gave me a drink on the house for waiting for so long. The main issue here is that service is so slow.  I know it shows 3 stars but I'm more specific than that. I give this place a 3.8"}
{"text":"Quite pricey, but you pay for what you get. It's so far the only Filipino restaurant I know that does't feel like a cafeteria. It's closer to fine dining and I wouldn't mind bringing non-filipino guests here. 

Best stuff: Crispy Pata, sizzling tofu & Buko Pandan. I can do without the chicken but the tofu, pandan and the crispy pata are a must! 

Make a reservation during busy hours.  They get quite busy."}
{"text":"Waiting time was horrible. We are a group of 10 with 5 kids (family not friends) and we waited for 1.5 hours they said 40 mins.  They dont want to open the other side til we told them. The bad part was it was memorial day weekend they put Military discount,vet and retired but the server said only for the service member if he will pay the bill. I just came back from 10 month deployment and my brother in law was inviting us but since Im not paying for it we dont get a discount. Our plan was if we get the discount we will add some of it on top of the gratuity tips. So Maxs please dont ever put discount in front of the door  if the group of service member are not getting any benefits."}
{"text":"We had my cousins birthday party this afternoon. As a chef myself, they started bringing out all the food all at once, guess what? They were all cold! Sinigang was bland, kare kare was also bland. 

I'm disappointed that the name doesn't hold its reputation at all!  I understand that most of our party was 15 minutes late but still isn't an excuse to serve cold ads, bland entrees. 

Its understandable that it's only a couple of months old but, management should've been prepared for such demand of this kind of chain here in Las Vegas. A town known for its culinary trends. 

Also,  half of the restaurant was half full yet,  the amount of people waiting at the entrance is just ridiculous!  I strongly suggest getting things organized because that is a fire hazard with people clumped up at the door! 

You should also train better bar servers/bartenders. The gentleman who had taken my drink order didn't even know what tap meant when I had asked him, what do u guys have on tap? He straight said. Sir what tap? Tap water? I'm like, WTF to that? He also did not know how to operate the POS system and how much my beverage was? Kudos to the other server who assisted the bartender. 

Overall wise, I will be back. But please remind the kitchen not to be afraid of a little salt and pepper. And if your kitchen staff wants to learn how to use proper seasoning?  Let me know ? thank you."}
{"text":"What I love the most about Max's is its consistency.  No matter what day or what time of day you go, the quality of the food is always very good.  Consistency is something that you don't find much in Filipino restaurants, at least in my experience.  I tend to order the same things over and over again:  pancit canton, adobo, laing, fingerlings, and of course the fried chicken.  Every time I go, the quality of the food is always the same.  The one thing I don't recommend is the leche flan - blech! terrible!!  Regarding service, the staff is super-nice and super-friendly, from the hostess to the server to the busboys.  Just like the quality of the food, the quality of the service is also wonderfully consistent.  The servers are always attentive and quick to ask if you need anything.  I've tried a bunch of Filipino restaurants in Las Vegas, but I've settled on Max's as my go-to spot, even though I don't live all that close."}
{"text":"Yummy authentic food . I ate like there's no tomorrow. You got to try their fried chicken of course, like the chicken I used to eat in Baclaran branch . Crispy pata-yummy. Kare Kare-yummy ."}
{"text":"So I went here a while ago with some family for dinner. The woman at the desk said it would be an20 minute wait but they had us seated within ten minutes. No problem. 

We order our food and drinks and wait. And Wait... And wait.. And wait some more. When I checked my phone I noticed that we had been waiting for 40 minutes for our food. We asked our waiter how much longer the food would be and he said \"soon.\" Twenty minutes later, we finally got our food.

We were so excited to get our food only to find that it was cold. The flavor was good, but when you're starving and wait about an hour for your food, you expect it to be up to standard. So the fact that it was cold kinda put us all in a bad mood. Especially when the people sitting next to us who just came in got their food before us! Really, annoying.

So the food was good but don't come if you're hungry because you'll have to wait a long time. The staff was polite and apologetic about the long wait. We even got a little free dessert because we waited so long. 

Overall, I'd probably come back because of the taste of the food. You should give this place a try if you're willing to wait."}
{"text":"To start this restaurant is way to noisy. The four of us COULDN'T hear each other thru the whole meal. The wait staff was the worst. Once we were seated it took at least 10+minutes before we were noticed by the waiter. We saw him two times more, take our orders and when he gave us the bill. The food was no better.

Go here if you like loud noise, crappie service and lackluster food."}
{"text":"This place satisfied my cravings,like no other Filipino Bistro  can.Luv,luv the food.Servers are very efficient.Prices are reasonable.So perfect for my taste."}
{"text":"I went to Max's for their famous fried chicken. Having been there before, I was excited to have some good Filipino food. This time I was really disappointed. We ordered a Half Feast and an extra order of pancit palabok. The fried chicken was only ok this time. The chicken adobo was very sour. The pancit palabok was tasteless with only two pieces of pork in it. My family was disappointed.  

To try to save the meal I ordered halo halo. There were barely any toppings in it. For $8, I should have went for bubble tea. I'm now excited for Jollytops."}
{"text":"Hope they will improve on the long line. Food is ok not so authentic on the taste buds.... But the employees are nice especially our server."}
{"text":"Overpriced Filipino food chain. Ordered the whole chicken but it was quite small, like malnourished and no taste. The oxtail soup was pricey and even worse was only 1 piece of meat (oxtail). 

I really don't understand the hype over this restaurant. I purchased 2 of the $30 for $15 offer and even at that price, you don't get much. It was worth a try for the special price but there is no way I would pay full price for their food.

Tip: I used the \"check-in\" on Yelp to get the free decadence desert (it was good), but when I used the $30 for $15 coupon, they informed me they will be charging for the desert. Can't \"combine\" deals apparently."}
{"text":"This is a graceful 4 stars only cause I'm Filipino and it's a nice quick spot close by to grab some memorable home cooked Filipino dishes, other than that, I have to give it a 3. The food is decent but the times I've gone i consider it a hit or miss place. The renovation and interior is beautiful, and it's a shame not that many people go. Not sure why that could be. I Would love to see their entire menu revamped as well as a more lively staff, maybe a location change??? Who knows"}
{"text":"Their combo meals suck you, don't have a choice what you want in it. Also their chicken adobo sucks. If their chicken is their specialty then why does the chicken adobo taste different from the sauce which also sucks."}
{"text":"The food and customer service is great in here!!! Try the chicken, sisig and pork sinigang!!'all great!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant! The food was ordinary but was definitely overpriced. Our server was not attentive - we struggled to grab his attention. He displayed an awful attitude towards us. I certainly could have spent my money elsewhere and somewhere better."}
{"text":"I understand that they just opened and the wait is long but if customers are willing to try them out and wait to be seated and served ... I think from then on at least the customer service should be pleasant and the food delicious and they would receive repeat customers. But my family and I did not experience any of these. The portions were small and way overpriced. To be perfectly honest I find the whole fried chicken that is made to order at Pinoy Pinay Restaurant more delicious, crispy and very flavorful. In fact my family and I enjoy Pinoy Pinay 's food better without the inflated price."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The only good part about coming here was them greeting you at the door. Once seated, we waited 15 mins and not one server asked us for drinks. We had to wave them over to finally take our  orders. Food was ok. We saw other people who came in after us get their food before us. They never asked us if everything was ok. We had to call them over again to ask for take-out containers and that took another 15 mins because the server forgot that I had asked. I'd probably skip it based on the service alone."}
{"text":"This place is apparently an institution in the Philippine. They have only 1-2 location in Canada. Their fried chicken was good. Their sides were a bit greasy. We had take out, so I can't comment on service. Their pricing was ok. I'm just not a fan of greasy food."}
{"text":"I love the garlic fried rice! Cook to perfection. Staff is always so friendly. Prices are fair and worth it best Filipino food in the city."}
{"text":"Never coming here again! Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm. WHAT A SHIT SHOW!

-the hostess misinformed us about drinks being 50%
-they have 6+ beers listed and only 1 available
-took forever to take our order
-after about 10minutes of putting our order in, waiter said they were out of the simple grilled chicken I ordered 
-changed my order to fried chicken and he brought me fries instead of the garlic rice I asked for
-fried chicken is their speciality, and it's tasteless
-i asked for salt, took forever to get that
-had to go to the bar for my beer because my waiter forgot 
-couldnt even get a lime for my corona
-had to get up to ask for hot sauce because the waiter never came to ask if we were okay after the food came
-the waiter I asked the hot sauce for never brought it, I had to ask a second waiter about 10minutes later
-when they brought it, i asked for peppers and they brought me a whole uncut pepper 
-our waiter had 4 tables, 3 were a bigger party then us so we were ignored
-both restrooms were out of paper towel, and even after we told them and went back before we left, THEY WERE STILL OUT. 

I cannot believe this place- I'm extremely dissapointed. Especially for a Filipino Restaurant."}
{"text":"They are still on their soft opening...we waited 20 minutes for our table (4 pax) and another 10 minutes for the server to greet to us....even though we came before 9pm which was their last seating... but it was all worth it...we just hope they work on their short comings before the grand opening...this place is packed...and a little bit more pricy than the Honolulu branch where we frequently visited before. We had Lumpiang Shanghai and Calamari for apps and both were awesome...For our Main Course...The \"Bistek\" was a little tough and missing a bit of calamansi flavor but the Lechon Kawali, Pancit Palabok  are great and the Kare Kare is to die for...as usual. Their whole Fried Chicken is always a winner. I also had the Lecheflan after and it was satisfying. All in all, this place is highly recommended if you don't mind paying a bit more than the other good Filipino Restaurants in town. And I also  wish they open another one closer to the Southwest side of LV soon, because I think one branch here is not enough to cater for the whole Filipino Community in LV...;-)"}
{"text":"Max's Scarborough, I found out has two websites. I wonder if they made this second site because of my not so good review which was the only one as well on that web site."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. I would never go back. I went once with my family to try it out every one said there known for there chicken.  There chicken taste like every other chicken, nothing special.  

Customer service is soooooo bad. This one server keeps passing by but don't ask if we needed anything and he sees our glass is empty and plates were empty.  I had to keep asking can u get this, can we get refill,  etc.

Food. OMFG. No freaking taste to the nilaga baka. WTF.... on the freaking menu there was Max teaser but the server said they don't have it. Then why is it on the fu***** menu. Calamari no taste and small as portion for every thing. The calamari they make u can buy a box at 99ranch for $11. Evrything tasted horrible. The bill was $85 for shit.I would rather eat at fiesta Filipina restaurant is way better and bang for ur bucks.
I ordered the crab fried rice yuk taste like shit like straight from the water. I asked if we can get it without peas and the server said its pre made. 

WTF!!!!! WHY IS THIS PLACE STILL OPEN IF FOOD AINT MADE FRESH!!! PRE MADE THEN INSTEAD OF CHARGING FOR FOOD THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE FRESH THIS PLACE SHOULD BE LIKE A PANDA EXPRESS U JUST PICK OUT THE FOOD U WANT. 

HORRIBLE FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. TWO IMPORTANT THING TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT...THEY CANT EVEN DO ONE!"}
{"text":"Slow service and it's quite expensive! But the food is authentic. They also automatically add 10% gratuity on the bill regardless of the number of guests in your group or whether you like their service or not."}
{"text":"Two days ago is when I went on my first isit. My mom LOVED max's original in the Philippines. And it's right down the street from the biggest Asian market. So we thought hey, lets not try it. 
The best fresh Lumpia I have ever had! 
Probably the only thing I would go back for. They are very expensive, not worth the food. 
We got, Fresh Lumpia, Kare Kare, Crab Fried Rice, Lechon Kawali, Whole Fried Chicken and Palabok. 
First glance, I really like the atmosphere. Love the fire place, place mats, the table, chairs, separated rooms for more intimate settings. And it has a full bar. 
It's not really wheel chair accessible in the dinning area. And quite big. 
The service was great at first. She was chipper, smiling, she knew how to pronounce the food correctly, she knew what to pair each dish with, or suggest the most common pair. Until a few more people came in, then it was a whole different story. I felt like she had a short attention span. Which isn't bad don't get me wrong. Or a bad short term memory. None of which is her fault. But I have both of those, and I wasn't that bad. I would be running around like a little chicken just so I wouldn't forget. Even carry things in my apron. I don't remember if they had pockets. But either way. 
Food came out to be $80+, I can cook all of what we got for around the same price. Seriously? 
The chicken was dry. Great coating. But covered in salt. Especially the fries. 
Lechon Kawali seemed old, over cooked, and not cooked in the right way. Palabok. didn't taste like anything and was not worth the calories, more than one bite. And MAN do I love food. 
Crab fried rice was delicious, but again with the salt. Could of made it at home. 
Kare Kare was bland. Oxtail wasn't very fond of. And Oxtail is probably my favorite in the meat department. I'm happy they didn't put tripe in it. Could have better veggies too.  

Needs more and better desserts. 

If they had better food, prices and service. I would LOVE to have a birthday or some type of celebration there. 

I would love to find and buy the serving dishes. 
If they didn't have such a great restaurant decor, it'd be a one."}
{"text":"Serving portions are small, so you can somewhat say it's overpriced. They didn't have sisig when we went, and it was within the first two weeks of opening. Our food came in at different times which is unacceptable in my opinion. Our server was ok. Based on my observation, it doesn't look like they were trained. They are actually more concerned about cleaning up the tables rather than taking care of the actual customers. Overall, very displeased with the experience."}
{"text":"I went to Max's  for my friend's birthday and I was really disappointed.  I could understand the the flaws with the food since they just opened. While waiting for the food (which took a while), I was observing the manager that has Nico on his name tag. First, I saw him smiling and giggling while talking to some female waiters but then a few mins later I saw him talking to a male waiter and it seemed that he was scolding him. Telling someone about their mistake is one thing but yelling and being rude like that manager Nico towards the male waiters was unacceptable.  I really feel bad for the waiters to the point that I wanted to confront that manager but I figured I should just put it here on yelp so people would know and if the upper management of Max's is reading this, please do something about it. I have been to this Max location four times and its obvious that they lack coordination and good management.

Food was okay but not that impressive. 

One more thing, the table beside us found a fly on their food but apparently it does not matter because they were still billed for their orders. They just replaced the food and moved on as if it's not a big deal finding a fly on your food. The name of their waiter was Kurt.

And please don't let employees with open cuts to serve or even get near the food because it's a healthy hazard.

 Oh and I saw Nico touching the female waiter's back..wonder if that's part of the job.

If they want positive feedback from people then changes have to be made and start with employees and the food."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet place. The Pancit Bihon was very tasty. We always had Halo halo for dessert and it was a bomb. If you ever visit Las Vegas you have to give this place a try..."}
{"text":"the best chicken for nolan my grandson 
the best sisig bangus and sizzling tofu for wowo and wowa 
you should stop by and eat !"}
{"text":"bruh this food is amazing, bangose the chicken and adobo is . customer service can be a bit slow though"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to going to Max, having long been tired of the mediocre Filipino cafes cum groceries that abound in Toronto.

Max did not disppoint. 

The good:
The fried chicken was delicately seasoned and succulent. 
The lechon kawali was tender and flavorful, with crispy skin. 
The bistek was tasty but the meat was a bit chewy. A better cut of meat should have been used. 
Halo-halo was a delight; not as sweet as I'd like to but refreshing still.
The lumpia ubod was good too. 
The service staff was friendly. 

The not-so-good:
The buco pandan was bland and had more gelatin than buco. Probably could use a bit more condensed milk and more buco. 
There should be more generous servings of the atchara and the lechon sauce. 

I'd go back for sure if I want to have tasty Filipino food in a nice, friendly and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is good, very much like the Philippines, but servers are inattentive and rude, will pretend not to see you or hear you because it's not their table to wait. Example the short waiter Guy and the girl with glasses in the front desk. Called us to our table like she was so annoyed. Doesn't even bother to smile."}
{"text":"Halo Halo = 5 star!!!! THE BEST DESSERT!!!!

Other food 3-3.5 star.  Today I had the all-day-breakfast with milk fish + rice + egg (2).  Quite a good combination actually, i enjoyed it.

Today is not too busy because likely it's a weekday.  Weekend is much busier.. all packed.."}
{"text":"First of all,  the food was pretty good! The garlic rice was really good. This place gives Good portion sizes,  and the pricing is not bad either. Second, The service was excellent. Our waiters nico and leomar were very attentive and polite. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"No doubt the food is delicious, however it's Very pricey and the servings are not enough. For instance the Kare-Kare it was served in big White Bowl but now it's in small black bowl. Will only recommend halo-halo , but the rest it's very EXPENSIVE and you have to wait for 5-10 mins in the line Plus 20 mins or more for your food.."}
{"text":"I went to this place because I heard they serve really good Filipino food and I just want to see what the hype is all about. My sister and I went here during their 1st-week opening, the service is great, staffs are friendly. The environment is cozy but the food isn't the best compare to other Filipino restaurants I've tried. What I find the portion of the food was good in the beginning but after few times I came there, it  got smaller for the price I'm paying. 

Anyways food I've tried: 
- Lechon kawali w/ vinegar: (4stars/5) what I said about, the portion got smaller though. 
- Kare Kare: (3stars) oxtail was cooked right bt too pricey. 
- Chicken: (4stars) one of my fave and this is Max's signature. 
- Pancit Palabok & Spaghetti: (2stars) the sauce was too bland and watery. Also, noodles are too soft and overcooked. 
-Halo halo: (5stars) the portion is great and its my fave. 
- Buko Pandan: (5stars) Never had this before and I love it. 

In conclusion, this place is not bad but they need to pay more attention on the flavoring of their food, portion and consistency. I recommend ordering they fried stuff and dessert. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"So I can't help but agree with the previous post on all the complainers.  The wait is ridiculous BUT THEY JUST OPENED, it does come with the hype and territory people!  
      I give 5 stars for the food.  The chicken was worth the anticipation and what I remembered from my trip to P.I two years ago.  That and it definitely satisfied my pregnant cravings!!!  I ordered the Fiesta plater and sisig.   The chicken was juicy and tender in the inside, and had a nice seasoned crunch on the outside.  The fresh lumpia was a nice contrast to the pallet.  The Sisig on the other hand was a bit disappointing to me because it had ears,  I guess I got too excited, and didn't fully read the description...lesson learned!  We did not get out caramel bars...but I guess that was the reason our waiter subbed out for ice cream.
       Service from our waiter great.  I didn't expect to much again because we were sat at 8:30...close to closing and the place was still packed.  However Jerry was awesome and attentive in any way he could.   He even made a sauce for us at our table to eat with our chicken!  
          So why 4 stars?  To my understanding they have been open for \"Soft Opening\" since last week, between the hours 4-9.   In my opinion that's one long soft opening!  At this point they should consider opening normal business hours to help decrease wait time in the evening.  It was 1h+ wait time when we arrived.  They were taking \"To Go\" orders also, maybe during \"Soft Opening\" stage this isn't the smartest move; again they are only open for 4 hours ATM.  The kitchen got to the point were they were at a halt and orders were stopped for a bit so they could catch up.  So maybe until they are fully opened, To Go orders should wait.  

     Anyways I am looking forward to coming back.  Overall experience was worth it...a few hick ups but a lot of great potential."}
{"text":"After dodging and weaving through busy rush hour traffic we arrived at Max's and were relieved to see that there appeared to be available tables. Hallelujah!  

So we strolled into the place, and inside the entrance way is nicely decorated with a picture of a palatial home with palm trees .. of which I presume was shot in the Philippines?  Perhaps it's Max's house. hahah :)

Two friendly hostesses greeted us and showed us to our table, which was located in a separate room further in the restaurant. Looking around, It seemed like this would be a party room as it had an overhead projector mounted on the ceiling and there were sliding glass doors on each side which could be closed off for private (karaoke?) parties. 

Once seated our waiter greeted us with the biggest smile found on this side of the continent, and addressed me as \"boss\", okay sure.  So he presented the menus --- which showed pictures and descriptions of the dishes along with the history of the establishment inside the front cover.  There was a good variety of the popular filipino foods such as pancit, lumpia, speciality drinks such as halo halo, and of course the fried chicken. Although there was quite a variety of foods, we wanted to sample two things and two things only: the fried chicken and lumpia shanghai!! Ahhhhh yeah!!
 
The moment of truth...........

One bite and we were in fried chicken heaven! The skin was crisp, the meat was tender and juicy. It tasted great with the banana ketchup sauce of which my fiancee had never tried before. 

Now for the lumpia shanghai...the lumpia was contained in a cute crisp basket.   We devoured them one by one including the basket itself! ( don't worry the basket was edible heh)

To sum it up, Max's Chicken offers a unique product while bringing the local flavors of the Phillipines to Toronto, which has not yet reached the mainstream popularity when dining out. 

Heard they will be doing a Grand Opening soon, and the hours will be more regular 10am - 10pm."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. We came in around 4pm and its perfect time because its not crowded. The pancit, chopsuey and the house fried chicken are the best. Amd the finale, the fried pork chock =)...yummy and crunchy."}
{"text":"Great authentic Filipino cuisine.  Service is great and food is delicious.  Prices are a little hefty, but as a treat, it's a great place to go."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. I must say that it's probably the best Max's restaurant I ever ate in. The food tasted good and all of our order came out of the kitchen the same time. I strongly suggest the pancit canton and the bulalo. Overall, I would definitely eat at this Max's again whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service was incredible. I think everyone in the restaurant including the owner came by to check on me. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the price is on the high side for a Filipino restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was ok. found chunk of bones on my lechon kawali sisig which is usually never happened before. The service wasn't that great, we waited for more than 30 mins for our food and when our food came in the server took one of our dish and told us he will be back and he will just change it coz something wrong with it so I freaked out and wondering was there hair ? or bug?  then when he came back he said that the dish look really unappetizing. Also he  once we finished we ask for our bill and he charged us something else."}
{"text":"overall this place gets 3 stars due to the lack of customer service but great ass Filipino food in Vegas !"}
{"text":"In Toronto, Filipino food is often served on styrofoam plates with plastic cutlery, and diners are crammed into a grocery store where the televisions are blasting the latest drama. This is one of the reasons why many Torontonians have never eaten Filipino food.

Enter Max's Restaurant, which is an easy entry-point for those who are trying Pinoy food for the first time. Overall, the presentation is good, the atmosphere is cheerful, and the staff are friendly. And from the often long wait times, it's clear that there is a market for Max's.

I've tried the kare-kare, the pancit, the halo-halo, and more, but my favourite dish is the lumpiang Shanghai, which comes in its own bowl made of a deep-fried eggroll wrapper. That's a nice touch.

Many diners have complained that the chicken is bland and dry. Could it be the type of chicken that the chefs are using? I hope that this can be changed to avoid more disappointments, so that more first-timers will be coming back for Filipino food!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum, everything was well prepared and tasted real good, from Pork Sinigang, Lechon Kawali to their Famous Max's Fried Chicken.  Very friendly staff and fast on their feet when requesting items. 
This Max's Restaurant in Las Vegas is well decorated, nice tables and seating and clean all around. Truly great comfort food with good pricing. Thanks Max's for the excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service was pretty good. Had the Max's special of their crispy chicken and canton pancit. The chicken was tender and pancit was freshly made. I did not understand the pre packaged caramel brownie but it tasted good. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Service is slow food is overpriced and bland. Been here twice in the last 5 yrs and nothing has changed. Would never go again and will boycott it to non Filipinos too. Please do not support this restaurant as they are a rip off and bland overpriced food."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco on a weekday afternoon and called in a takeout order on my way to the hotel in a cab. I arrived to pick it up 25 min later and they had lost my order of chicken adobo. They rushed a replacement order thru (cab was still ticking) and didn't mention it did not come with rice. When I got back to my hotel, I was disappointed to see it was gonna be just chicken adobo and nothing to soak up all that awesome adobo sauce.

The chicken adobo was nice- but nothing amazing. I would maybe come back again to try something else, but maybe not as takeout."}
{"text":"surprisingly Max's Las Vegas was a bit disappointing in their cooking..boneless bangus seemed to be undercooked and missing out on ingredients and flavor..inihaw na liempo was somewhat boiled and grilled..portions are small..but place was cozy and is serving alcoholic drinks.."}
{"text":"We are all from southern california and we went to las vegas last week to celebrate my wife's birthday.As we were strolling around Flamingo road, we saw this Filipino restaurant, Max's and we decided all to eat hear. We ordered every Filipinos favorites like lechon kawali, sinigang na hipon, fresh lumpia and fried chicken, not to mention a ton of rice,LOL!
WOW....45mins after ordering we havent receive anything yet and we were all starving. The people next to us said that it took an hour for them to receive their order.
We were all getting pissed and decided to cancel it if theyre not going to make it a lil bit faster.I dont know what happened but after 5-10mins, our order came out...ayayaiiii,finally!
They have a good food,yeah, no questions about but their SERVICE SUCKS!SO SLOW, so make sure you go hear an hour before you feel your hunger or else, u might pass out due to empty stomach!
A LOT OF SERVERS but LESS COOKS, THATS why!!!!!"}
{"text":"So this place just opened,. Its a brand new establishment with super major hype and people are expecting everything to be completely perfect.. LOL!! 


 We arrived about 5:30 and was told the wait was 40 minutes and to give them our number so they could text us when a table was open. 47 Minutes later we got a text and were seated promptly. About 6 Minutes later a guy appearing to be the manager was taking our order.. We ordered the appetizer of calamari but it was sold out, Understandable, as max's calamari is known to be very good. So we just went ahead and ordered 1 Mickey Bihon,1 Whole Chicken 1 Regular Crispy Pata and a large garlic rice. All the food was very delicious and served very hot. Our drinks were refilled promptly as well, Overall pretty good for not even being fully open.. 

Give them a break guys... Im sure things will get better after the staff has a chance to get used to everything and the hype dies down. All of the max's i have been to in the Philippines have really good food and very bad service LOL,.. So Calm down you 1 star people.. Go make a review of McDonalds.."}
{"text":"I had the sinigang soup and then also half a chicken.  The prices are most reasonable and the service is really amazing."}
{"text":"very well-staffed. the food is delish! their lechon kawali sisig is to die for. this place is by far, the nicest filipino restaurant in town. rice is not included but its cheap and the serving is huge. get the garlic fried rice instead. yum!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had with Filipino food!! I ordered some take out: pancit bihon, fried bangus, & Filipino beef steak. The food came out to be kind of pricy too, 40$ for nothing. And the young lady who answered my phone call didn't tell me that my order didn't come with rice so I didn't have any rice with my meal. What Filipino can eat food without rice?!?!? 

It was my birthday and I wanted to eat some pancit; it had absolutely no flavor in it. The noodles weren't even cooked right, it looked and tasted like soggy noodles.  

The fried bangus was just whatever. I had no care for it after I ate it. 

Lastly, the beef steak: it was the worst tasting thing I ever had!!!!! The \"gravy\" in it was just watered down with oil and soy sauce. I'm used to beef steak having lots of yummy flavor, but it was the exact opposite. 

NOT TO MENTION ALL THIS FOOD I ATE I THREW UP EVERYTHING BACK UP WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR!!!! I had the WORST upset stomach ever!! All I did was throw up my whole meal. This is the worst place to eat Filipino food. I wouldn't want anyone to come here and get sick from their food. So I hope someone else had a better experience than me because I didn't enjoy mine at all."}
{"text":"The wait is already long. So understaff. Its so chaotic. No one is really running this place. Orders are taken after sitting for 30 mins. To the owner, please this is America. Why not come and help your business thrive. We are trying to help out Filipino businesses but too bad. We aint coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to Max's many times over the years. More so in the years before than now because in all honesty, the food portions have gotten smaller since they opened. It's not worth the price anymore. 

Their customer service has deteriorated over the years as well. They used to be attentive (maybe it was because they were new) but now my table is always ignored whenever we go there. I remember the times when I got tired of waiting and actually just went to the front desk to ask for something. I just don't think that kind of service is acceptable. 

Regardless, my dad likes the restaurant's food, so we always make sure to visit when it's his pick. 

And one thing that I will always like from them is their halo-halo and their buko pandan. They get an A++ on the desserts for sure!"}
{"text":"I dined to this restaurant 3 more times since my last review. Waiters are always polite but there's one thing that seems to be a routine or the \" norm\"  at this restaurant. They serve partial of your order. It's kinda awkward that one person will get their ordered meal in the same table while the rest waits for theirs for a long period of time. I never understood the method of why bother bringing partial meal for the group with individual food orders. I don't get it... It's just poor practice/service."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. This location is better than home in the Bay Area more portions here than there I don't know why.."}
{"text":"We had a birthday celebration here and brought our own cake (from a bakery). We ordered a party size menu and asked the server if we could cut the cake after our meal. We even said we didn't need plates from them (and would just use our food plates for the cake) and even offered to pay extra. We were told we could not cut the cake and eat it at the restaurant. The server kept checking to see if we were cutting/eating the cake. This totally dampened the mood of the birthday celebration. I have never been to a restaurant where they wouldn't allow this. It is unfortunate as this was my favorite Filipino restaurant in Toronto but I will not be back after this."}
{"text":"The appetizer, Pork egg rolls, were crisp and delicious.  The two dishes, Pancit Canton and Sizzling Beef Kaldereta, were hot and delicious.  The service was great. 
I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"We came by for dinner and from the beginning,  the front host was rude and did not sit us the area we want it. Then waiters took a long time to even ask us what drinks we wanted., maybe because the basketball game was on! Some of food was cold and other very salty, drinks very expensive for the side and service was terrible. Overall, below average since place look semi clean."}
{"text":"We went here with my family thinking it would be a very good idea to have lunch here.... so we tried. 

Asusual as filipino restaurant its always full
And so we waited for like 45min to get a seat and have lunch. 
We ordered some karekare rice and something else... we placed our orders and we always ask the server for our order as they are very slow. We waited 30minutes for our food.. 
Servers just keep on walking walking but i noticed one table needsnto be cleaned but either one of them clean it. 
I would say 5minutes before they start to clean it and so other people can seat. 
I heard other filipino said, \"linisin mo na para maka upo na kami ano ba yan\". 

Food was okay.. not good..but its okay.. 
Karekare,, not good but its ok.. 
Maxado malapot at puro sabaw!!! Wala manlang maxado meat.. nakaka loka. Di na mauulit. 
Once we tried ok na yon.. 1st n last visit i guess."}
{"text":"Legit Filipino food. A tad pricy but the food is on point. Service with a smile. The Halo-Halo is legendary. They give you a decent amount of rice for the price too.... It's so annoying when restaurants overcharge for rice."}
{"text":"Stopped here on Saturday for lunch to-go during Memorial weekend. Ordered a combo meal and a regular bangus sinigang. The staff was extremely nice and made sure to keep me updated on how much longer my order was going to take. I was sitting in the waiting area and during the wait, at least 3 different employees came up to me to make sure I had been taken care of. Excellent service! Food came out right around the promised time and everyhing was delicious! Wish they had a location in Orange County, CA too!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Late post - this happened earlier last month.

The long awaited opening of Max's is finally here.  Here are my thoughts about this place:

1) WAIT = The long wait was expected because of all the hype. No problem there...the only issue I had was when the host tried to give my spot in line to somebody that he knows.  When I approached him about it, he told me that he doesn't have a table for 4 yet he offered a table for 4 to his friends that just got there.
2) AMBIANCE = the ambiance was good. Definitely a good family place to dine in.  They also have a bar inside which is a plus considering their location. It also set up nicely for private events as there are sliding doors that could separate sections of the restaurant.
3)  SERVICE = The service wasn't as good as expected but given the fact that they just opened 8 nights ago (dinner only), I have to say that they have to do a lot of training specially their bussers. It took 15 mins before we got our drinks while there are at least 3 bussers walking around for plates to be put away instead of making sure that all the customers waiting gets their drinks first.  I finally called one of the staff which seems to be a manager or a supervisor as he wasn't wearing the waiter uniform instead he was wearing a blue shirt with a tie. I had to ask for our water and informed him that we are ready to order. After placing our order, it took another 10 mins and my husband has to asked another server for our drinks. Our waiter Lloyd apologize multiple times about the delay which is nice. He made the rest of our dining experience tolerable.
4) FOOD = We ordered 1 full chicken, regular crispy pata, regular kare kare and bicol express and buko pandan for dessert.  The chicken was ok, I think the one in Glendale was better. The Crispy Pata was amazingly good. It was fried perfectly on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. The Kare-Kare was also good. The Bicol Express is perfectly seasoned and spiciness hit the spot. The buko pandan was delicious but the winner for tonight's dinner was definitely the Crispy Pata.

Overall, the management should consider training their staff more on quality customer service so they don't end up a failure like Goldilocks. We, Las Vegans are quite particular with the quality of service and food since we are blessed with many upscale restaurants. I would definitely give them another chance and comeback."}
{"text":"This is my first time being at Las Vegas and also the first time eating at Max since I miss the sweet aroma and taste of authentic Filipino food. This restaurant was not one of it... 

I was disappointed from the start. Starting off with the service, we were a party of 6 and usually, it's understandable that we would have to wait since there was a lot of people. We were told to wait for \"less than 20 minutes\"

20 minuets went by and yet we weren't seated yet. More people started to come in and they came in groups of 10, but yet they were seated instantly because they were a bigger group! Within 5 minuets we were promised a table when a big group was about to leave, but less then 10 minuets later another group of 10 came and just took our table! 

We were then seated after a whole hour...

Now with the food. It was dry and tasteless. 

Growing up in the Philippines especially when it comes to traditional food everything needed to be spiced up and juicy. Max did NOT do that with their food. 

I felt so robbed when I had to pay $104.87 just for a bunch of food that taste like a cardboard."}
{"text":"Love love love max's!!! Went there for lunch...As a filipino and a foodie...they have the best and most diverse options for sisig...and each variety doesnt disappoint...love their chicken with the banana sauce as well! It is pricey compared to other filipino restaurants around the area but quality is topnotch...i do not like vegas in general but i can keep on coming back there just for max's!!! It is good, it is comfortable, it is home..."}
{"text":"My white friends like this place too.

There's a lot of butt-hurt yelpers on here.  Why so harsh people?  So i get it... your mom makes the best pancit.  Your uncle Boy fries the best lechon kawali. But man... Max is pretty legit!

Took a couple co-workers here and everyone had a great time with great food.  Ordered a bunch to share:

Fried chicken-  that crispy skin though!  hook me up with the Jufran (banana ketchup)
Pork Adobo- seasoned well and a crowd favorite 
Lechon kawali- that fried pork belly so good!  Dip it with the vinegar
Kare kare- oxtail stew with veggies ina savory peanut sauce pretty legit, not amazing, but good
lumpia-  eggrolls-kind of bigger than i'm used to (no pun intended) but good appetizer
Pancit- stir fried noodles, standard and good
Flan-  sweet custard, deliciousness just like mom's

Got my filipino food fix here in Vegas.  My mom's pancit is still better than your mom's, but Max'z is a good place to introduce your non-filipino friends to some good filipino food.  Your filipino friends will still enjoy it here too.  OK... pass me the Red Horse"}
{"text":"The food is not authentic filipino.  You can make the place fancier but still it is the overall experience.  Food ill give a 1.  I hate when it comes to asian food in general you gotta ask me if i want rice with it. It should be provided with the meal.  The kare had no flavor, lumpia was mediocre, caldereta didnt have that ooomph to what caldereta is.  The chicken is extremely overpriced and raved. I had this back home and it didnt remind me of home. Unless youre serving me chicken you raised yourself its effin fried chicken.  
Halo halo was aite. 
Service was ok. 
Verdict-Triple O...Over rated Over priced Ober n Out"}
{"text":"Went here Monday to give it a try. First and last time here. Service was great but food was just bad. The pancit was horrible, it had so much soy sauce. The beef steak has so much fat and was chewy. The place is very nice and clean but that's about it."}
{"text":"Seriously crushed and disappointed
The five of us wouldn't give it more than a five !!!!
Terrible.... so excited to find a Max's in the U.S. ......"}
{"text":"Filipino vibes ;) 
Came here on a thanksgiving weekend was driving around in this area and found this eatery I was like Ohmygawd so excited and told my family that Maxs is very popular in the Philippines. Known as \"the house that fried chicken built\".
My hubby said calm down okay we'll eat there lol! 
Kiddos disagree noooo!!!!  They're picky but of course I won ! And we were HungryAF! Let's go!

We were lucky to wait for only 5 mins but then I noticed this eatery is always busy loved by tourists & locals (big Filipino community in Vegas).

Drinks- we all ordered mango juice it was lightly sweetened loved it.
Food- the famous whole fried chicken - hmm crispy skin on the outside and tender n juicy in the inside it was perfection so tasty and flavorful. And best eaten with the famous Jufran banana ketchup (so popular in the Philippines) or you can use Worcestershire sauce. Hubby ordered the pork sour soup called sinigang but it was pretty bland. The garlic rice was a lot and it taste good. 
Overall great dining experience we couldn't finish our food huge servings here. Highly recommended this place stop by when you're in Vegas . 
They also offers variety of authentic Filipino dishes but fried chicken is popular must order! 
The waiters are friendly and welcoming. 
I can't wait for them to open Max's chicken place in San Diego area sometime soon?
Definitely coming back here again one day."}
{"text":"I don't really see myself coming back here.

Like the other reviewers said, the service here is a bit lackluster, in terms of speed and just trying to get them to notice you.

The food is only pretty good. My boyfriend and I had ordered the lechon kawali (deep fried pork belly), shanghai lumpia, Max's famous deep fried chicken and the extremely expensive kare kare (oxtail in peanut sauce).

The lechon kawali doesn't even come cut. It's legitimately one huge slab of deep fried pork belly that you pretty much have to cut yourself. Lechon kawali is usually cut into mouth size cubes. When it came out .... A knife wasn't even offered, we had to ask for one. I found that to be a little ridiculous.

The shanghai lumpia was good ... But then again, it's a little hard to screw up spring rolls.

Max's deep fried chicken was a huge huge huge disappointment!! Makes me really question just exactly why is this supposed to be their specialty? It was quite bland and very dry. Room temperature at best.

Though, I gotta give them credit for the kare kare which hands down might have been the best kare kare in Toronto. Even better than my grandma's!! (sorry grandma) But if I remember correctly, I ended up paying around $23 for a decent sized bowl. I do understand that ox tail isn't exactly the cheapest, but come on now! 

All in all, like I said at the start, I don't see myself coming back here, due to the service and disappointment of over hyped food. The kare kare was really the only thing that made me push this review to two stars. The only time I see myself coming back to Max's is if I was with a huge group or my over sized family. Because what Filipino restauraunt doesn't accomodate huge familes right?"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with Max's restaurant. It's an extreme love hate for me. I either love this place, or I absolutely hate it.

I've been to their big joint down at Dufferin, and I think I had written the same kind of review as well. It's all bittersweet.

I live literally 2 seconds away from Max's Scarborough, so when it had opened up of course I had to try it! Of course I was hesitant, remembering my experience at the Dufferin location, but convinced myself that it might not be the same thing. In some aspects it was, and it was not. Unfortunately, it was the same in a bad way. The price point.

The place is stunning inside, probably the best decorated Filipino eat in place I've ever seen. Very modern but still with that very unique traditional Filipino spin. This place is a bit hit and miss when it comes to crowds, just like any other restaurant it'll be busy around the dinner hour (6-8pmish). 

I had come here on a Saturday morning to get me some Filipino breakfast, one of my favourites 'Tapsilog.' I also ordered it along with a Pandan shake, both to go.

Cashier lady was very nice and offered to walk me through the menu if I didn't understand it, but having Filipino blood in me I was pretty cultured with the food. Very simple painless procedure of ordering up and waiting for your order. If you order to go, you can stand by the counter (i sat by an empty table) or if you order in they actually have someone bring the order to you once you've had a seat. You are given a number for them to track you down so be sure you have it visible just to make their lives a little bit easier.

Food was a little longer than I had expected for quite a simple dish. It came in a good quality plastic bag and I was given a farewell with a big smile, always good to have that experience.

I was ready to chow down when I got home and my first thoughts were, \"Huh ... $9.99 for this?\" The portions were the first thing that caught my eye as Filipino places tend to be quite generous with servings but I didn't get a mild stroke this time from the price as I had already expected it from their Dufferin location. Pandan shake was good, not too sweet and it'll make me come back for more. The tapsilog was soooooo good, it really reminded me of those weekend mornings when my mom had marinated the beef strips the night before to have those yummy pieces of breakfast meat to look forward to. I think the flavour in all is what bumped my original 2 star to 3 stars.

I really want to route for Max's Express, I really do. But the prices are incredibly off putting. If you have the chance look up their website and check out the menu for the Scarborough location, the prices are just a slap in the face in ratio to it's portion size.

I haven't gone back here and I'm really thinking of making a return, but I would have to really, really, realllyyyy crave Filipino food to make a come back knowing in the back of my mind that I can get equally delicious Filipino food at practically half the price. 

I would say it's a good place for those who may not be familiar with Filipino food as I have actually seen quite a few mixed races here in Max's, but after that, I may suggest looking for another place that isn't as expensive.

Also kudos to Max's Express for strategically placing their restaurant in front of a Filipino church!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the restaurant two stars for their poor customer service as of this date.  To my surprise,  my wife and I saw very few patrons, servers socializing among themselves and the other one putting napkins and utensils on the table to appear busy.  We waited for someone to seat us at a table.  Instead, none of them notice or approach us so we end up seating ourselves at a table.  We waited ten minutes at our table until I had to walk up to a server to give us a menu.  However, the food quality consistently deserves five stars.  That's the main reason why I decided to return to this restaurant whenever I visit Vegas from L.A.  I hope the manager of this restaurant reading this review will make improvement of the customer service or else the business will slowly go downhill."}
{"text":"I invited a friend who never had filipino food so, I introduced the basics. Chicken adobo, pancit, lumpia, shanghai, beef ariscaldo, and famous fried chicken. Everything was lovely until they brought out a CARAMEL DESSERT BAR IN APLASTIC WRAPER. YES WRAPPED IN ITS PLASTIC. how cheesee, ghetto, poor is that? It would have been 5 star but, plastic wrap is NO WAY TO GO. Ruined it"}
{"text":"Visited from Washington DC and one of my aunts who live in Vegas treated us out to this restaurant.  The portions were big and each meal was delicious."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than going to Max Restaurant with family. The food is great. The place is so clean. I really love the leche flan. But the most part  that you will never forget is what I called \"The amazing fried chicken \".   Come and visit the store and you will not regret it! See you again Max Restaurant."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a review for Max's and it wasn't a pleasant experience at all. That event occurred 2 years ago.

I decided to give Max's a second shot and dropped by here with a colleague of mine on a Friday evening. My friend was new to the filipino food culture, so I wanted to make sure he had an enjoyable time at a filipino restaurant and what better choice but to take him to a renowned name.
I made reservations for two, assuming that it was busy on a Friday evening. As soon as we arrived we were seated within 2min. The server didn't take our order soon enough, but it was forgivable. That evening, my colleague and I had a lot of fun. The music was great, the ambiance was inviting and happy, and the other people in the restaurant were entertaining. I've noticed that with every birthday celebration, all the staff or servers would bring a dessert to the celebrant and sing a traditional filipino birthday song while everyone else clapped, in which we joined in as well. 

Due to the service and the whole service that evening, Max's has redeemed themselves in my eyes. We had so much fun that evening; part of it was from the whole experience as well as good company. I must say that they had an excellent playlist running that evening that my friend and I couldn't stop bobbing and humming to everything that was playing. There was also a party next door and other people couldn't help but get into the rhythm of the awesome music. 

Thanks Max's for the excellent experience. You've definitely regained my loyalty and I'm excited about the new location opening in Scarborough. I hope they maintain this flow of service. Only one thing to point out; some of the dishes weren't that good. Maybe I'm just so used to home-cooked filipino dishes."}
{"text":"It's really good but pretty pricy for what it is. Had kare kare which was delicious. Also had the dinanguan which was average. Service was on point."}
{"text":"Do you like your fried chicken unseasoned? Then Max's Restaurant is for you! The only thing I liked about their fried chicken is the crispy skin. Meh."}
{"text":"The restaurant's ambiance is pretty good, the food is ok the negative thing about the restaurant is the service. Service  should be improved, had a party of 20 at the restaurant and the service with my guests were not really up to par for a restaurant. at this price. Some of my guest had complaints that the water wasnt refilled quickly enough. 

We will try to revisit and update this review hopefully it will be better than the last time we dined at max."}
{"text":"I hated this place in the beginning but after a few more visits,  ordering the right stuff, ill gladly admit I'd visit this place more often if it didn't get packed so much.

the right stuff:
-crispy pata
-fried chicken

i personally will just stick to these 2 items for now"}
{"text":"Last time I came here, Max's was still new and I wasn't so impressed compared to the Max's from when I was a kid. 
I'm glad to say that when I returned with my brother and his family food and service was much better. Service is friendly... Started out a bit slow but once an order comes out, the rest follows pretty quick. We were all extremely hungry and luckily we got seated right away before the Saturday dinner rush started.
Our order:
- Crispy pata... My bro's fave, it was crunchy and lots of meat, they need to double up on the vinegar/soy sauce tho
- Fried chicken... Skin was real crispy and good, but the meat is a bit dry and lacks flavour, need the banana ketchup
- Kare kare... Pretty good and big, lots of meat n veggies
- Pork sinigang... Also good and big with lots of meat n veggies
- Chicken sisig... My sis-in-law's fave, it was meh for me, lacks flavour
- Lumpia... Typical but good
- Garlic rice... A must and lots of it!
- Halo halo
- Ube flan
- Mango ice cream
I passed on dessert, but from the looks of it, they all really liked it.
We most definitely over ordered and there's lots left over, but O Well, guess we won't need to cook for tomorrow.
This place is good for an occassional visit as it is far from me or my family and it's pretty pricey. Luckily, both times I've been here, I didn't have to pay ;)"}
{"text":"Filipinos and filipino cuisine enthusiasts have something to be excited about. This is the real deal. Although pricey, but just like any sit-down restaurant you are not only coming for the food but for the experience. Casual/trendy set-up with a bar welcoming you at the front door, as you turn the corner with a dim dining room, as you sit down you will notice that the small spotlights on the ceiling focuses on the table and not whats around you. The star of the show is obvious; the food. We ordered bangus belly, beef kalderata, lechon kawali and famous garlic rice. All done/cooked/presented well. Kaldereta had a different sauce than your normal fast food turo-turo place. Probably because its not populated with oil. Although msg is obvious it was executed well. The lechon was the hit. Crispy outside and moist inside perfect combo with the filipino staple mang tomas lechon sauce. Best lechon i have had so far. Great service, food takes longer than a normal filipino place, but worth the wait. Well done!"}
{"text":"Writing this after my third visit to this place.

In short the food is good, the service however is not so good.
My third visit 12/10/13 our server was Ian. But this dude decides to disappear on us after serving our food. 
On the other hand, another server Steven noticed us & made sure to get us refills & desert. So kudos to Steven."}
{"text":"The restaurant ambience is very good and clean. Love the food but the sago gulaman is sweet. Pork Sisig needs some crunchiness to it ."}
{"text":"There slow service the place is all some so be sure u call for reservation before u come"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that Filipino food is a bit foreign to me, in that I've tried it a few times and liked it, but I have no idea what the dishes actually are. I imagine most visits to Max's are pretty similar, as their menu favors a family-style format where you basically grab and eat whatever's closest. A couple of recent visits here helped me get to know what I was eating.

For intro-level Filipino food, snag some fried lumpia (spring rolls), chicken adobo, super-crispy fried chicken (ask for banana ketchup), and their salt or garlic rices. The grilled beef skewers are a must-get item for me, but pinkabet (vegetable stew), kare-kare (peanut butter-based sauce), and inasal (grilled chicken) are other dishes I can safely get here without risking the rage of my cardiologist. Ease into that side of the cuisine with dishes like lechon kawali, crispy pata, and lechon sisig. If you have room left, finish up with the confusingly tasty halo-halo (a wild mix of textures and a giant scoop of ube ice cream) or the slightly-tamer Buko Pandan (green jelly with coconut ice cream). 

Though I usually prefer to go to smaller local Filipino places (or friends' houses) when I want to eat these dishes, I really appreciate that the food here is not as greasy as other places, which is a huge part of what tips this into the four-star category for me.

TIP: They recently added single-serving bowls of some of their best entrees for weekday lunches, so now you don't have to round up a whole herd of friends to get your fix."}
{"text":"I had ordered a to-go this afternoon (for my dinner at home). SO disappointed. I didn't liked it. I felt as if I'm gonna have a heart attack after! TOO OILY. I think I've tasted the oil more than the chicken. Ughhh!!! (2-thumbs down). Nothing can beat the ORIGINAL Max's in Sct. Tuason. Franchises in the states (SoCal & Las Vegas) have failed this taste test."}
{"text":"Max's chicken is what they are popular for. this is the filipino tourist a must stop before leaving vegas. a little pricey for the serving that they give."}
{"text":"Overrated.. Overpriced.. UNDERwhelmed.

3 words to describe my dining experience at Max's tonight.

Came here for dinner with my mom and a couple of her coworkers. We came just as they opened for dinner (5pm as stated on the sign at the door).  However there were so many people seated and eating already when we got there..!  So much for a 5pm dinner time.

Anyways, on to the food. We ordered pansit bihon, lechon kawali, pork sisig, nilagang baka, and the famous whole chicken.

I was so unimpressed with everything we ordered..! I felt there was a definite lack of taste and flavor to all the dishes we ordered. As for their famous chicken.. mehhh.. I'll take jollibee fried chicken any day!  I was most disappointed with the nilagang baka.  We went to Max's restaurant in San Francisco a couple weeks back and it was one of the best nilagang baka I ever had, but sadly this location could not replicate that same great tasting soup :(

The prices to me seem a bit steep as well for food that's not all that great. The only positive thing I have to say about tonight's dining experience was the service.. Our server was friendly and attentive. The space of the restaurant is not half bad either. 

Will I come back..? Maybe once the \"opening\" hoopla dies down, and they get the food right. But I don't forsee it happening in the near future."}
{"text":"Third time here.... love this place! Food is plentiful, tasty, and very authentic.  Great service. Nice family restaurant!"}
{"text":"My Aunt, Uncle and I came here for dinner for the first time.  I am sorry to say I was disappointed with this restaurant.  It's not worth the hype.  My Aunt and Uncle was told there would be a 30 to 40 min wait.  I met up with them and they were still waiting.  We were finally seated and the waiter don't even know his name or if he even introduced himself,  took our order.  It seemed he wasn't paying attention or he felt he was being rushed because he kept disappearing every time we would say something.  He first asked us if we wanted some drinks, we told him what we wanted.  He then disappeared again.  Took him awhile to come back with our drinks.  We finally ordered our main dishes, took them awhile to bring us plates.  The table we were sitting at, one of the plate settings was missing a fork, but the rest of the other utensils had forks in them.  We kept asking for things, where the waiter should of checked up on us if we needed anything.  Big Fail.

We ordered Kare-Kare, Sinigang Baboy, Crispy Pata, and the famous Chicken.  I am sorry to say I was disappointed in the Kare-Kare and Crispy Pata.  The Kare-Kare had more vegetables than meat.  Fail.  The Crispy Pata wasn't crispy enough.  Failed again.  The Sinigang Baboy was good, but I've had better.  The Chicken was good, we ate that all.

The waiter not once asked us if everything was good.  Not once the waiter came by to refill our waters or drinks.  I literally had to ask the waiter to refill my drink.  Failed again.  My original drink was Pepsi, when asked to refill, it was refilled with Ice-Tea instead.  Double Fail.  Don't even bother, not worth the trip.  Even though it's still a soft opening, they need massive organization and many more to name.  I just hope they will fix these quirks before their grand opening in about a few weeks."}
{"text":"40 minute wait for 8 pp. 45 minute for food. Ordered 2 sisig, 2 chix, 2 sinigang na baboy, baka, kare kare, 2 appetizer platter. Three bowls of rice. 2 soup came but no plates and rice. 7 plates arrives but I never was given one. By the time all the food was served the two sinigang is cold. But it's ok, the dirty tables around us keeped my eye site entertained. Guys we are in Vegas . Clean tables and bussing and filling the drinking glass with beverage is important. Class 101. Can't blame the servers, lack of Managment. Food was tasteless . The sisig was to salty. Chix was  precooked and pre heated or fried. It was dry from the inside crispy outside. Don't take my word but the three chef from Caesars entertainment that are with me agreed. And also I ordered some chix to go for my wife. Came home and the chix was frozen inside but crispy and hot outside. I remembered eating in downtown LA every Sunday at Max. It was home cooked food. Here the kare kare is made out of instant mix. The other fino restaurant use real peanut butter. The appetizer lumpia, I think was bought from seafood market and just served it to us. Nothing to brag, but our local Filipino restaurant here at Vegas are much better. Eating at Max is bad first impression. 

A little advice, restaurant 101, soft opening, you over staff not under staff. First impression is the \"wow\" factor not holy shit most of the tables are full of dirty dishes. We call this in the food and beverage department, first in first out. Servers coming in brings food or drinks, when they go out they bring back dirty dishes. Sorry ... Didn't realize Max restaurant lowered there standard. Oh last thing. 96% of all customers goes to the bathroom. Should be clean, I promise I'm not lying."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at Max's as I was with three Filipino friends and didn't want to go to Jolly Bee (again!). We started off with the Pork Egg Rolls which were very tasty, along with the dipping sauce. I will certainly order them again next time.

As the \"main course\" for lunch, had the Whole Fried Chicken, Rice Noodles with Chicken, and a bowl of Garlic Rice. All were very very good, and would order it all again, but will try other items in the future.

The fries served with the Whole Fried Chicken were disappointing as they arrived cold. However, they were replaced with a sizable bowl of hot fries when asked for a replacement. The ladies liked the fries so much, they took the leftovers with them when we left.

Overall, it was a very good meal, although somewhat pricey, but reasonably pricey. Not overpriced, even though it was Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Each of the food we ordered were great, but I must say the serving size were little for the price. The staff were friendly, however they took long to take our order and would forget our simple request to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to eat here the moment I saw they had a C rating, but my family insisted because we've eaten at other locations and had great experiences. This one was the exception.

We ordered fried chicken, sinigang, kare kare, sisig, and lots of different vegetable dishes. I honestly did not have much of an appetite because of the rating and sure enough, two weeks after we had eaten here it was on the news that they had been shut down. 

Despite the unhealthy food that I have consumed, the service was great."}
{"text":"I love Max's! 

I have been to many locations and I was happy to find one in Las Vegas :) 

The customer service is really friendly and efficient plus I just love Filipino hospitality. They are super welcoming and you can't find that everywhere nowadays.. 

The food is always on point-my family and I ordered a few bigger plates so everyone could share: -Fried Chicken -Sinigang -Noodles 

We were super full and happy after our meal!"}
{"text":"Today's service was below par. We waited 45 minutes for cold Nilagang Baka soup and fish!!! Waited an extra 20 minutes for the check. Filipino food is meant to eat fresh off the stove... Hot and made to order. Today's service and food was such a disappointment. $70 bucks for soup fish and noodles that tasted bland and cold is not something I would expect from this establishment... The staff needs a lesson in hospitality and speedy efficient service. Sorry Max..you're in the food industry...first thing you should recognize is you will frequently service starving customers who will be your worst critics if kept waiting."}
{"text":"Place smelled good, but it took more than 45 minutes to be told that my food wasn't even ready yet, I left."}
{"text":"Was really excited to eat at Max's after a very long time but the wait, the service and the food was not worth it all. Wait time was over an hour, and there were empty tables that needed to be cleaned. The crew lacked teamwork. Mishaps were being discussed by the cashier and the waitress (who was pretending to be busy by wiping down the menus) which could have been discussed later with a superior maybe as an after-action report. Some of the crew were really busy but some were walking around in a daze. We ordered our drinks and our food together but it took a long time for the drinks to come and when they did, they missed a few people's orders in our table of 8. FInally, after what seemed like a long wait, our food came, not at the same time. So because we were starving, whoever got their food first already started eating.  When our food came, it was mediocre. I ordered the crab fried rice  and there were egg shells in it. The sizzling sisig was drowning in oil. The rest of the food was okay, nothing worth mentioning. The only good thing that stood out was the nilaga, which was really tasty."}
{"text":"Edwin A. of Toronto is so right when it comes to service. My husband and I, along with our 2 yr old daughter, went for dinner last night and the waitress just couldn't wait to take our order. She seemed to be rushed all the time. My husband ask for more ice tea and she literally held the glass, put it down and did not come back for the refill. We have to get her attention again to fill it.  Then she came back w/ take out containers and I was still eating (talk about rushing) and...... the bill landed in our table as well without even asking for it. 
Food is great but I think they should work on hospitality, either that or our server was just having a bad day. Oh well, looking forward to going back there anyway but hopefully next time a better server."}
{"text":"Great place for unique food. Great service! The chicken is amazing! The San Miguel beer is also a good compliment to the chicken. The wait was a little bit longer than expected. But that's expected for a new place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and the food is pretty good. Unfortunately their slow service and terrible seating space ruins any good.

I understand that you have great Filipino cuisine, and that you're located in a Filipino populated area, so what I don't understand is how your space can cater to less than your incoming clients.

Increase your servers.
Increase space - ie occupy the open space next door.
Reservations on weekends makes sense, first come first serve doesn't.

Waiting 2 hours only to wait another 30mins for take out (because we got annoyed) ruined the entire experience.

I cannot recommend going here if you want to just show up on a weekend and enjoy good food. You'll be waiting a long time."}
{"text":"Looking for dinner, but wanting to try something different. Getting in touch with our roots, we tried Max's.

We were thinking that the plates would be small for some reason, so we ordered several plates. We were WRONG. It's a Filipino restaurant, they want you to EAT.

We ordered the fried half-chicken (OMG DELICIOUS), Kare-Kare, Chicken Adobo, Beef Sisig, Pancit Bihon, Lechon, and sinigang. Everything was just like the family cooked it. The FRIED CHICKEN, though: it was perfectly crisp, not battered, and perfectly tender. While they wouldn't tell us the secret, they did tell us it was a spring chicken.

Of course you can't leave without halo-halo. And it was on POINT.

Must try, but it is somewhat family style, so don't order everything, even though it is an option!"}
{"text":"Really great fried chicken, and Filipino food! I've been here a number of times and I always want to come back. Just a little note: Make a reservation on busy nights and holidays just in case it's busy (I see why it's busy; cause almost everyone loves the food). Waiters/waitresses are very nice and they are willing to serve you so that it feels like home. Their chicken soup is very tasty, their chicken is crispy and very tender, their lumpia shanghai is very moist, their pancit is flavourful, their kare-kare is awesome, their lechon kawali is very very crispy, and lastly, their caramel bars are a nice end to the meal. Nice job Max's!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give Max Fried Chicken a try again.  I was there in November 2013 when they first opened and was sorely disappointed with the chicken.  it was almost tasteless.  Last night, we ordered the chicken, bulalo, garlic fried rice, and lechon kawali.  ALL of them were not up to par.  What a waste of my $$.  Max Las Vegas is very much aware of people's complaints of their flavourless chcken and, yet, they have not improved.  The bulalo was mostly broth.  We had two pieces of fat, a bit of meat, about 3 strips of cabbage and 2 corn on the cob.  I was expecting much more for $17.95.  The lechon kawali was not fresh at all.  The meat was dark and tough.  The garlic fried rice was just okay.  There was absolutely nothing special about it.  

I have to say that our waiter, Gilbert, was AWESOME.  He was most attentive and very knowledgeable of their food items.  Kudos to him - just not the food.  I don't think I will be going back to Max'."}
{"text":"NOTE: Yelp Check-in Offer (for Ube Decadence) CANNOT be combined with Yelp Deal (15 for 30).

I'm rating this as one star + one Crispy Pata Star.

We came here because we bought the $15 for $30 Yelp Deal. I came from the Philippines and have had Max from the Philippines, which I have enjoyed.

Alas, I cannot say the same here. The service is horrible. So many uncleaned tables and there were people waiting in line. That just shows the inefficiency of this place. Why not clean the tables so people don't need to wait.

We ordered the Crispy Pata, Chicken Sisig and Bowl of Garlic RIce.

1. Crispy Pata
The only thing I'd go back here for (if ever I do since it's too far and this experience was just disappointing) is for the Crispy Pata. The Crispy Pata was done perfectly: crunchy skin and tender meat. That's all I can ask for in Crispy Pata, which for some reason a lot of Filipino Restaurants can't achieve. There used to be another one who can do it best, LJ Kusina, which has closed down already and became an express joint.

2. Chicken Sisig
Excuse my language but... WTH is this? I've been to Max in the Philippines and it's where I had my first Chicken Sisig. It was amazing and addicting. What we got here was nowhere near as close as the one in the Philippines.

First, the meat was just in huge chunks instead of being coarsely minced and chopped as what a sisig should be. It's more like eating non-fried chicken popcorn with some minced onions and stuff.

Second, the meat was white meat instead of dark meat. This maybe because it's targeted more to non-Filipinos who prefer white meat. But this is not what someone who drove all the way to eat what they had in the Philippines comes to expect. Because they used chicken breast, the dish was dry and there was just no flavour at all. I was hugely disappointed.

Third, usually chicken sisig (at least from Max in the Philippines and in Casa Manila in Toronto), is a little saucy. This is because chicken in general has less flavour than pork. And if you're using Chicken Breast, you better put that sauce because it ends up exactly like what we had: dry, bland and just disappointing.

If you want to experience real chicken sisig, go to Casa Manila please.

3. Garlic Rice
The garlic rice just wasn't as flavourful as other places I've tried, like Casa Manila.

4. Ube Decadence Dessert
So as we were checking-in in Yelp. We noticed there was a check-in offer. Cool! Let's see terms and conditions: \"Applicable for dine-in only\". Sweet! We showed the server my yelp check-in to avail.

This dessert is just like pudding with some ube filling. There's nothing much here that reminds me about Filipino food here other than the ube which tasted a little fake, like not the Philippine ube taste.

FINALE:
So we asked for our bill, and it came after 20 mins. We showed them our Yelp Deal and the server took my phone to bring it to the cashier. She comes back and says Yelp Deal cannot be used with Yelp Check-in Offer. So it's either we get the $30 off the meal BUT pay for the dessert, OR get the free dessert and use the Yelp Deal next time. I tell them that there was nothing in the Yelp Check-In Offer that stated that. And that if we had known we couldn't use it, we wouldn't be ordering that dessert to begin with. She went back to talk to the cashier again and comes back to say that they can't do both and we have to pick one of the two options. I'm just frustrated at this point and definitely choose the Yelp Deal option since I don't really want to have to go back again. What an ordeal!"}
{"text":"Saw this new restaurant and decided to give it a try.  On the plus side, since the place is new, it's clean.  I like how the restaurant can be sectioned off for private parties.  I thought that was pretty neat.  Service was pretty quick and the food was tasty.  The only thing keeping this from a 5-star rating was the cost for liquor.  I ordered a Captain Morgan (rum) and Diet Pepsi (no Coke products).  My jaw nearly hit the floor when I saw the charge on the bill...$13.  I'd go here again, but I think I'll stick to beer if I drink."}
{"text":"5Star ratings for a 5Star service from our server Lloyd!  The food is absolutely flavorful & delicious!  It's officially the best Filipino Restaurant in town, hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my God daughters Christening party.  We had a separate room for about 20 people all to ourselves.  We had the kare kare, chicken, lechon, and pancit.  The lechon was definately my favorite on the menu followed by the fried chicken, pancit and lastly the kare kare.  I will be back for the lechon however, id like to try other menu items.  For desert we got these complimentary Caramel Bars.  The texture will surprise you.  The caramel bar reminds me of eating cookie dough.  I actually really liked the bars.  If you've never had them id suggest you try it just for the experience."}
{"text":"Food was Amazing, was not a big fan of the fried rice with crab but everything else was absolutely amazing. Next time I am there I will have to try the hola hola"}
{"text":"Ate here for my nephews' b-days. My review is based on eating here just once with a party size of 11. The only other table service filipino restaurant I've eaten was Salo-Salo and in my opinion that one went downhill through the years. This one definitely has a better atmosphere and the service was good.

The food we ordered was serve family style. We ordered lumpia, kare kare, friend chicken, adobo, and palabok. We also finished the meal with Ube Ice cream. The food was good though my family (they were born and raised in the Phillipines) commented that the fried chicken was ok yet lacked the taste they were use to back home. I enjoyed the palabok. I'm happy they used the thicker noodles (other filipino restaurants use the thin ones). The ice cream was nice. I'm glad it didn't have ice crystals in it. 

The service was good with all the waiters filling our waters/drinks frequently. This place definitely is cleaner than Salo- Salo (no roaches roaming). 

Price-wise this place is a little expensive."}
{"text":"The prices aren't justifiable here at ALL! For a small bowl of kare kare, $19.99 are you kidding me?? It seemed shareable between 2 people but there wasn't even enough meat - that's really not fair to be paying such a high price for that type of portion. CHINESE take outs are WAY more generous in portions than this I kid you not and these are supposed to be MY people! Just don't get it, please DO something about this! The flavour of the dish itself had a very strong peanut-butter taste so that I will give them that, other than that stay away from this item unless you're coming here alone.

Next, the bangus sisig. The dish was really good in my opinion and had more meat than the kare kare (really makes me sad since kare kare is my favourite Filipino dish). I also ordered the lumpia shanghai and that was pretty generous in portion as well - I'm noticing a theme when it comes to the kare kare dish - it's always the same sad story - never enough.

Because I checked in for the first time on Yelp at this place, I was able to redeem a free ube decadence dessert. I will say it was amazing - I loved the taste and the texture. Very savoury. The calamansi drink we ordered was pretty good, and service was also attentive. I would hope to come here again but it sucks that I probably wouldn't order my favourite dish since I know it wouldn't even suffice. I'd be surprised if someone responded to this review and actually decided to do something about this issue that everyone keeps talking about."}
{"text":"We got a half chicken to try because the guy recommended it. Nothing to write home about. It was pretty greasy. But not the worst chicken I've ever had either I suppose. The banana ketchup was ok."}
{"text":"If you want **Horrible Service** then this is the place for you! Don't get me wrong the food is good, BUT I will personally tell all my friends and family NOT to even bother going to this place! I don't believe the servers understand what good service means! You name it, missing order, wrong food, wrong bill and having to flag down the server JUST to get drink & a refill WOW! The server is clueless on how to do his job! He looked lost and confused on how to do his job. What's even more disturbing & surprising to me is when I attempted to addressed and inform the manager to let him know what's going on, he was even worst! I realized that the manager is part of the problem! He needs a major understanding and training on how hospitality works! Rather than understanding our concern and solving the problem, he could not wait to leave our table without offering any solution or apologizing instead he run back to the kitchen pretending nothing is wrong! Whoever the owner that invested money to open this place should really take a long hard look on how bad this place is being run! After waiting for over 45 minutes to get a table I expect to have great service! Good food alone won't do specially in Vegas when there are multiple restaurant that are completing for the market share! This place will go bankrupt if the service does not improve! This is my first time dinning to this place you can rest assure that I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant!  There you go you've been warn!"}
{"text":"We had the talong, bulalo, fried chicken, lumpia Shanghai, classic sisig, talong,  lechon kawali and halo2 all very good except the talong.  The talong seemed boiled instead of roasted, watery and bland.  Service was very good.  I'm craving it again!"}
{"text":"First time here and i love it. My fiance and I opted for bar seating and we couldn't have been more pleased. Our service came from CELENE the most awesomest bar tender and she not only helped me kick off my weekend with 1 1/2shot of tequila in my calamnsi juice but she was always on point, kept the bar so clean, rotated around the customers and just plain awesome. The food was great, yes, a tad bit pricey but it doesn't disappoint. I will definitely be back here. Thanks celene!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people don't give this place 5 stars.  The food is great and tastes authentic and the ingredients appear to be fresh.  It is expensive - but good food always is."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!!

Just recently had my son's 1st birthday here. What we agreed upon was not honored. On the day of the party the waiters kept pushing items that was not authorized by us. They kept suggesting to reorder food saying that people were looking for them. There was a lot of food left that almost all my guests was able to get a to go food. The next day some of the guests called me saying that the food they took was already spoiled. I had to apologized and hope that they didn't get sick.  Lastly, the server tried to hustle for extra tips knowing full well that they already charged us  for gratuity.  I will never again do an event here nor recommend this place to other family or friends."}
{"text":"In general, a nice casual dining restaurant where you can grab some solid Filipino food with friends and family. 2.5 stars cause I always rate more base on food. 

I got the chicken and Pinaket. The chicken was crispy, but could be more moist. The Pinaket tasted pretty good with the shrimp sauce. I prefer it to be less salty. I went there for late lunch and there was really only one or two servers working. Great service spread thin. Had to wait quite awhile for food.  

Great place to grab a bite of Filipino food if you live in the area. Would not specifically go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I called Max's Scarborough @11:00 am  April 2, to make a reservation for 1:30 pm celebrating my daughter and father-in-laws birthday for 25 people. The man who got my call and orders assured me that by 1:30 pm our table would be ready.  By 2:30 pm our food wasn't out yet and everyone was very hungry by then . my daughter and i followed up on the food, wondering if there was any updates twice. A certain Melissa came to our table and came to apologize but in a sarcastic and arrogant way. This was extremely rude and unnecessary...that was not the right way to deal with the situation, she even told us at the end \"its your choice on whether you want to stay or not\" all of us were shocked.. It was as if she wanted us to leave. I told her, what's the use of calling early and made reservations? and the man who got my call was so happy to get my orders and assured us everything will be okay (it turned out that the man who got my call was the owner as per Marilyn)
What kind of customer service is that?
...Marilyn, came and humbly apologized. Thankfully she came to deescalate the situation. If it wasn't for her, we probably would've walked out. She went above and beyond to ensure we were happy. She was clearly the only one who embodied great customer service."}
{"text":"The interior is nice and clean. Service is great!!! My boyfriend and I don't know why it only has 3 stars. Eating here brought back memories of my dining experience in Max's in the Philippines. It's my dad's favorite restaurant, and now it's mine. 

With our 3 visits so far, we've had:
1.) MAX'S CHICKEN - Got the half chicken since we wanted variety. It's crispy. My boyfriend wants a bit more seasoning, but I think it's perfect; it's just how I remembered it when I was in the Philippines. The server taught us how to make the sauce for it (mixture of banana ketchup, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce). With that sauce, my boyfriend's seasoning comment went away. He loved it. 
2.) LECHON KAWALI - Loved it!!!! I ate a lot!!! Perfectly cooked. 
3.) PANSIT - Delicious!!!
4.) BUKO PANDAN - It came in a sundae cup. It has ice cream with it. Delicious!!!!
5.) PORK SISIG - It was ok. I'd rather wait to go to Gerry's Grill in LA for some great sisig.
6.) HALO HALO - Delicious!!!
7.) CRISPY PATA - Awesome!!!
8.) GARLIC FRIED RICE - Just okay. It's not the fried rice I was expecting.
9.) SPAGHETTI - It was pretty good. Just a bit step up from Jollibee's. I'd rather order something else.
10.) SOUP OF THE DAY - The ones we got are pretty good. Perfect way to start a meal.

Tip: If you're a big group, tell them from the start that you'll have separate bills. The one in our group said they had a nightmare before because they only mentioned that in the end.

Again, service is great. Same as how I remembered Max's service is in the Philippines. We got seated right away. The server didn't pressure us to order right away. We got a lot of refills. Waiters are willing to serve us even if it's not their table. The manager went to our table twice and even took our dessert order. Everybody greeted us on our way out. 

My boyfriend and I were discussing why the heck it has 3 stars. He said most of the reviews were when they first opened and were about the price. Here's the thing: Max's is really supposed to be an elevated version of traditional Filipino cuisine. How can you expect other ethnicities to respect our cuisine the same way they regard Thai or Japanese cuisine if you don't elevate it? Why would always equate Filipino food with cheap cafeteria food? Yes, I like carinderia food (like Tita's in San Diego), but we always want to present the best of our food in a refined way. And of course, having better versions of our food mean higher prices. For example, you don't expect to pay cheap for a good Italian pasta. Same thing with Filipino cuisine. I think we should support these kinds of restaurants so we can proliferate elevated version of traditional Filipino cuisine. 

Update on my comment about past reviews: I talked to our waiter. He said that they had a horrible start because they didn't expect the huge crowds that came in when they first opened. He said that compromised the quality of their food because they have to make a huge amount of food in a short span of time. It's pretty normal now.

Haven't had bad experience yet so 4 stars.

Last note: I wish they didn't close the Max's in San Diego, CA. They should open one in Mira Mesa, a classier area of SD with a high concentration of upper middle class Filipinos. Or Eastlake area. I'll be sad when I move out of Vegas. Anyway, we'll be back!!!! I'll take my parents here when they visit me since they rarely go to LA on their own anyway. I'm so happy to have found Max's in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Filipino cuisine, but they just need a whole new staff and better management. It's such a rare occurrence for a waiter to come check up on you if you need any drinks or even to find a waiter on floor. I take back the whole new staff comment they just need better manager and organization on how things are run. I've come here so many times expecting a better experience and it's just lead to more disappointment. Love Filipino food tho. ALSOOOOO if you like boba that's hard in the middle aka not cooked go here."}
{"text":"Filipino food is usually so heavy and the food here was a welcomed change! The Laing and Sisig were delicious."}
{"text":"The food was so bland!! The chicken was bad. Your better off buying a whole chicken at SAMs club or Costco! Don't order the kare kare. It dosent even taste close the to the traditional diSh. This place is a shame! Go eat at seafood city down the block"}
{"text":"We were craving for Halo halo and decided to go to Max's for dinner. My family and I like going to this place because of the short drive from our place. We enjoy the food. The crispy pata was the perfect in terms of meat texture and flavour. The pork sizzling was by far my fave to order because I do not know how to cook this at home. Our server Ciara was very accommodating and polite with us. We will definitely go back, over and over again. 
To top it off, they have the best Halo halo!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here on April 6, 2014. We came for late lunch, about 3pm. The restaurant was very clean, beautifully decorated, and the ambiance was so nice! 

Collette was our server and she was so accommodating and helpful! We had never had Filipino food in a restaurant setting, and she was really helpful in making choices, and also in making sure that everything our kids ordered was GLUTEN SAFE. Both of our kids have Celiac Disease, and so many restaurants either don't understand, or don't care about those with food allergies. Max's staff was both knowledgeable and caring! My kids did NOT get sick!

We Had Pancit Bihon, Pancit Canton, Crab Fried Rice, Whole Chicken Meal, Half Chicken Meal and Halo-halo for dessert.  DELICIOUS!!!!

It was also my daughter's birthday, and the staff sang to her and gave her a complimentary dessert. Very sweet. 

Thank you Max's Las Vegas for a wonderful experience! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!  This place is Amazing !!!! My fiancé and I were looking for a great place to have Filipino food while on vacation in Las Vegas.  Read many reviews and decided to try Max .  Upon arriving we were quickly greeted by Will and got a great table. Will was very knowledgable of all the great menu items and assisted us in a very friendly and caring manor.  The lumpia appetizers were so yummy.  Will got our drinks and appetizers out Super Fast !!!! The Crab Fried rice is to die for ... Amazing delicious !!!! Had Luchon 
Kawali. And was the best I have ever eaten !!!! My fiancé had Pansit be hon and she said it was amazing as well.   The portions are huge and enough for 3 people !!!! The restaurant was very clean and neat.  Bathrooms spotless..
I will most definitely be back and I hope Will will be here to take care of us again !!!!! Loved it !!!!   David M Cole.  From Houston TX"}
{"text":"I like the ambience! I sensed the filipino spirit around and it feels like home. I like the design of their bar which I think is quite different compared to other filipino restaurants in Vegas. The servers were cool and I admired their patience because if you've noticed some pinoys are maarte. Anyway, the Max's platter has everything you need to try if it is your first time. I suggest you come really early or reserve because when we went there it was packed and super slow (waited 53mins for food). Good thing my friend were able to bribed the host $5 to get us seated immediately and reduced our waiting time. Overall my experience was OK. I don't feel excited to come back. Hopefully their service will get better because I love filipinoy food maan! :)"}
{"text":"Will not eat at this overrated place. Even the manager has no good customer service. Yes the place was busy but that doesn't excuse that other tables that sat after us got their food first and on top of that they were missing two of our entrees. The waiter didn't even look like he was checking up on our order it was the other waiter who was trying to help.
As for the food it's just a plain fried chicken anybody can cook it. The sisig was a pile of greasy pork pieces. It's so bad that I rather eat at jollibees."}
{"text":"I'm an American ex-pat living in Mandaluyong City (Metro Manila). Was delighted to find Max's here in Las Vegas today during my business trip. We ordered 4 different  entree dishes and each one was even better than the Manila branches I frequent! Service was super friendly, dishes came out hot within a reasonable time and the manager even stopped by to ask how everything was. All in all a perfect Filipino lunch."}
{"text":"Came all the way from Michigan and I must say, it brings back memories from the Philippines. The crispy pata and fried chicken are must-haves!"}
{"text":"Food was great. My favorite was the garlic rice, it's a must! The kare-kare was good, but not as much meat as I hoped.  However, the meat was good and tender, as was the sauce. Chicken adobo was great also. Our fave was the lechon kiwali. Lumpia Shanghai was good. 

We did take-out: the employee was very professional and polite. This service is hard to find! 

Price: reasonable for the quality/quantity"}
{"text":"One of my top favorite Filipino Restaurants in Vegas. Must try the Max's Chicken, Dry Adobo and everything else on their menu! Soon they will be open late nights with drink specials and  meal deals. The atmosphere is nice and the entire staff are much nicer and respectful... You can definitely feel the \"Filipino Hospitality\" when you dine here!"}
{"text":"Usually go to Las Vegas every year and frequent the Filipino restaurants, but an old town friend told me that Max's was here. Did not register that this was the MAX's restaurant originally from the Philippines or the same one in Honolulu, Hawaii!
Brand new restaurant. Service was great. We went at 6:00 pm - ish. For me, adobo was so good! Extra is the garlic rice, but still, it was SO good, I went back AGAIN by myself and ate at the bar. I finished the WHOLE thing and I was full. So good.
I am glad that this restaurant is here and the outside lit sign says \"Cuisine of the Philippines\". It was nice to see some Caucasians in the restaurant (with no Filipinos with them). It seemed like they were enjoying the food also. Big families, big tables, nice atmosphere. Waiters seemed always wanting to please. I spoke to the hostess and said I hoped the restaurant was doing well, and she said it was!"}
{"text":"Masarap naman e. Ewan ko ba kung bakit sila naghahanap ng food na katulad sa pinas. Duh! Bakit d sila umuwi at mag hanap ng authentic province style food? Smh pinoy nga naman."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because I had never really had Filipino food besides Jollibee's fried chicken. We came here for an early dinner and overall I thought it was pretty good, although it is really overpriced for the small amount of food you get and the service was a little lacking.

Because I had only had fried chicken before that was my immediate go-to, especially because I heard that Max's is famous for their fried chicken. I went with a half fried chicken dinner and Tapsilog, which was a breakfast dish with strips of steak, garlic rice and eggs. I thought the food was really good, but I really have nothing to compare it to so I have no idea if it was authentic or not. If you ask Rachel S, she'll tell you it was so-so and that she's had better. I liked that the steak and rice had a light garlic flavor and that the fried chicken was crispy and juicy. What I didn't like was the price in relation to the small portions received. I mean, what kind of chicken are they frying up here? Cornish game hens? A 2 piece at Popeyes would've been more food than the half chicken they were selling here for $11.99!

Service was also medicore at best...when we needed something it took us a while to flag down the waiter if we even saw him at all. Also there is a window where you can see into the kitchen and our whole meal we saw them running around with a fly swatter and checking the walls inside the kitchen...that made us a little uneasy...the health inspector might need to make a surprise visit here very soon lol."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner here and what a pleasure to see such conspicuous improvements compared to our previous visits!  We were told that we would have to wait for 25 mins. for a table for four on a Sunday evening but it was really about 10 mins.  We were promptly seated by a courteous and friendly host.  Although the restaurant was busy as usual, we had our order quickly taken and served at the same time.  We really enjoyed our pancit balabok, crab meat fried rice, asparagus and tofu, chop suey, Filipino bistek and chicken sisig.  I'm quite health-conscious so was quite happy with the two veggie entrees we ordered.  We topped off our meals with the obligatory halo-halos...always difficult to enjoy a Max's meal without leaving room for halo-halo!  A treat as always.  We also loved our complimentary ube creme decadence just for checking in with Yelp!  Thanks Max's!  Our family enjoyed this visit here and are very happy that you obviously take your customers' feedback into consideration when improving the dining experience!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Max's is always clean and the authentic food is always good. The service is very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my parents.  We had the Lumpiang Shanghai (Spring Rolls) ($7.99), a whole fried chicken ($14.99) and a large Garlic Rice ($3.99).  We wanted the Crab Fried Rice ($9.99), but they said it wasn't available that day (we went on a Tuesday.  Maybe it's only available on the weekends?  I don't know).  We also had a Halo-Halo ($5.99) and a Buko Pandan ($4.99) for dessert.  Yeah, I know, our meal was completely devoid of vegetables, but none of the veggie dishes looked that appetizing.

Anyway, so the Lumpiang Shanghai came in a basket made of fried spring roll wrappers - a neat idea.  The spring rolls are tiny, but you get quite a few of them.  They were delicious and flavourful.  I'm not sure what spices are in them, but they taste different than Chinese spring rolls.  They came with a nice sweet and sour dipping sauce.

The Garlic Rice was 5 large scoops of rice with bits of fried garlic in it.  Very garlicky, but tasty.  The fried chicken was good, but not spectacular.  I have to admit that I was expecting more from a place that is famous for its friend chicken.  It was a bit oily and there is no breading.  I think they just rub it with some spices and fry the entire chicken whole.  The chicken was moist, but not all that flavourful.  Although it tastes really good with the \"Banana Ketchup\" which incidentally doesn't have any tomatoes in it, so it's really a banana sauce (although it's red and looks like ketchup).  

The Buko Pandan was the most delicious part of the meal.  It was chunks of pandan flavoured jello, coconut, and tapioca in a rich cream sauce, topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream and toasted rice flakes.  So rich and creamy and heavenly.  You have to try this if you go to Max's.  

I was actually looking forward to the Halo-Halo most during this visit and while it was good, it was overshadowed by the Buko Pandan.  The Halo-Halo was a typical mix of palm seeds, coco de nata, macapuno strings, red beans, a piece of flan, a scoop of taro ice cream and toasted rice flakes, all on top of shaved ice mixed with coconut milk.  It is very colourful and comes in a big glass with a paper umbrella in it.  It was less sweet than the Buko Pandan, but still good.

The server we had was very friendly and efficient.  He even offered to take a picture of us (with our own camera of course), which I thought was nice of him.  We weren't even taking pictures, he just randomly asked us if we wanted him to take a picture of us.  Some might find this strange, but I thought it was nice.  So I pulled out my phone and he took 2 pictures of us.  

This was my second experience with Filipino food (my first being at the now defunct Manila Hut in Ottawa), and I'm looking forward to trying more of this cuisine.  

I think I want to try the Crispy Pata (deep fried pork hock) next time.  I've heard so much about it, and other people in the restaurant were having it, and I was going to try it but felt intimidated by the size and artery-cloggingness of it all.  

Casual dining atmosphere.  Lots of parking, as it is in a strip mall.  If you've never had Filipino food before, I think this is a great place to start.  There are lots of pictures and descriptions (something that was severely lacking at Manila Hut, which is why I did not have a positive opinion of Filipino food after my first experience.  Had my first experience with Filipino food been at Max's it wouldn't have taken me 7 years to try Filipino food again!)."}
{"text":"Overall experience okay, will probably return if I am in the area.

The fried chicken lives up to its reputation, juicy and tender.

We also had a Tilapia dish that wasn't on the regular menu, but on the table-top seasonal/weekly special menu -- flash fried and comes with a refreshing dipping sauce.  Quite enjoyable as well.

Slow service, even though the place was less than half-filled when we were there.  The wait staff were friendly and apologetic when they finally showed up, more staff and/or more training might help."}
{"text":"Over priced Filipino food. They are surviving on their name along because of how famous they are in the Philippines. Last time I was there I had the over priced Bulalo/Nilaga and it only had konti beef and it wasn't init. How do you not serve a sabaw that is not init. The chicken was just OK and the fries were cold. I also had the expensive calamansi juice that was in a small glass. In my opinion the best sit down Filipino restaurant in town is at D' Pinoy Joint."}
{"text":"There is no sense of urgency in the service here.  They greet us and ask how many.  Then they continue to chit chat a while amongst themselves.  Walk in 5:45pm and it feels cozy, they have a fireplace on. It is clean and spacious. Walk by and smell garlic rice yumm!!! 6pm and I'm asking anyone if we have a server?  It has been 15 min since we sat and we don't even have water. 6:03pm and we place our order.  The server apologizes at 6:20pm. I had calamansi juice served with ice, refreshing and sweet. We get our food at 6:30pm. Starved! The lechon Kawali is good and crunchy skin with soft meat.  Tastes great with the Mang Tomas sauce. The garlic rice smells great and has the right dry but soft texture. Pancit palabok was also good.  Thank goodness the food tasted good.  I would give the food 4 stars alone. The tab for two of us came out to $31.24.  If only the service here was as good as the food. I was really unhappy sitting at our table waiting 45min to eat. Not the same experience I had in a Northern California location."}
{"text":"Poor customer service!
Ordered halo halo (7.99) for pick up
I went in and the cashier did not even acknowledged my presence. Just left.
Server name who did that is Kessler (his name plate)"}
{"text":"Well I now know where to go if I want some really amazing filipino food (yes don't let the profile picture fool you) when I am in Las Vegas! 

My wife was actually laughing at how excited I was to eat here and even after the meal she walked away impressed (and she is more white then I am at times). Ha-ha! Ok now, focusing.....

For starters we began with fresh lumpia (lumpiang ubod) as an appetizer and that blew me away. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the sauce (peanut butter) was just to die for! OMG, you must must try the fried chicken. They are known for it for a reason as that sucker was just melt in your mouth scrumptious! The chicken was just moist to the nine and the skin was so light and far from greasy at all, so well done! My main attraction was the spaghetti which hence the 4 to be honest. I mean don't get me wrong it was great, but I think I prefer Jollibee's a tad more. I just felt the sauce didn't have the same sweetness I am used to and prefer. Also I'd have liked to see just a little more hot dog in there than what I had consumed. Finally for dessert which I \"didn't have room for\" was the halo halo. This by far was the best I've ever had. They make it from scratch so definitely felt the love. The bean is not as pasty as I usually taste which was a relief. The ube ice cream is just out of this world (perfect blend of sweet, similar to how I prefer my ube slush with boba). Another definite must try to end the meal

All in all the staff is very inviting and prime examples of what the culture truly is all about. I felt like family here and will certainly back for round #2 somewhere in the near future!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We had a sisig, taro leaves with coconut milk, kare kare and garlic rice. The price was on the higher end compared to other restaurants. But service could be very slow so we placed our order on the phone first."}
{"text":"Whole chicken, pancit canton and fresh lumpia..good (lukewarm) food but service is a bit slow...six employees sitting behind a glass wall doing the books (maybe would be better if they were not in view) while some customers are leaving because no one has greeted them.  
Our dinner is good, perhaps we got here at a good time, before the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Im writing this review as I am walking out of this POOR service restaurant. I got seated at 4:35pm and there was about 6 waiters working, and waited for at least 10 minutes for service. We were ignored during that time, then decided to walk out of the restaurant. Neither of the waiters had asked what we wanted to drink nor if we were ready to order. We then went to Goldilocks where we got great service from time we got seated."}
{"text":"Max's has been a go to restaurant for me for delicious fried chicken (no kfc for me). Having been to the Max's in Manila and Waipahu, I wanted to see if the Vegas location measures up. I've tried most of the menu here (fried chicken, chicken inasal plate, sweet and sour fish filet, pinakbet, oxtail kare kare, pancit bihon, lechon kawali, and crispy pata). I would say all the food is tastes very good. Get the LECHON KAWALI! You will not be disappointed! And one more thing, their halo halo is the best restaurant version i've tasted."}
{"text":"Not good. Buko pandan was too sweet. The pan it palabok was junk and so was the pan it bihon. Only good thing I liked was the kare kare and the chicharon bulaklak. Expected high of this place thinking it would be the same or at least similar to the one in the Philippines but nope."}
{"text":"I've been to Max's about 10 times, 8 of them being before they even opened up. It's located in the old Lone Star Steakhouse standing alone between an Albertson's and Chevron. You can't miss it.

The interior is very nice, certainly nicer than any Filipino restaurant I've been too. It's fancy like Vegas but not so cause there's no go go dancers. There's lots of seating and a bar.

I did some research before coming and noticed Max's is known for their fried chicken and halo halo. I had the whole fried chicken dinner with two sides, some slaw and fries. The chicken was kind of disappointing. It wasn't meaty, juicy, or crispy. It was tiny for the price but had some good flavors, potential to being good. The slaw and fries were basic nothing special. I'll try the chicken again just cause it's what they're banking on plus it was their 1st day.

The halo halo was good then again can you really screws up halo halo. For those who haven't had halo halo it's a cold dessert made up of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various beans, fruits, and fruit preserves. Sometimes there's ube ice cream which Max's does.

They serve other Filipino food at pretty reasonable prices. The customer service is very friendly. Let them make their \"special sauce\" they get a kick of making it for you. I think it was nothing but banana ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and something else, it was alright. I'd probably come back."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time going there. And both times there was a long wait. And we went at a decent time 8:00pm. They seem really busy no matter what time you go though. Took them at least 20-30 minutes before they can seat us. I asked to just be seated at the bar since I was so hungry I couldn't wait any longer.

So we get seated at the bar and our server comes up to us and asks us what we would like to order. I looked at him with a blank stare and said maybe I can order if I had the menu to look at. So he grabbed us menus and didn't come back to us until like 15 minutes later. I was already losing my patience. So 15 minutes later he comes to our table and takes our order. We ordered the kare kare and lechon kawali sisig.

I was surprised that the order came out at a decent time. But the food was OMG delicious! Took me back to when I was younger and living with mom. She always would cook Filipino food. We ate all of the kare kare it was a good serving for at least 2 people. The sisig was good too but I was more focused on the kare kare. lol.

Our server came back to us and asked if we would like to order dessert. We ordered a halo halo to go and a sago at gulaman. I didn't taste the halo halo because we gave it to my gfs grandma but the sago at gulaman was really good. Not too sweet but not too bland. I wished they put more ice though.

But overall the food is delicious. But just be prepared for the wait and the 'ok' service."}
{"text":"The best food ever! Miki Bihon, patatim and chicharon bulaklak, kare kare to die for! The atmosphere is really nice, the staff are outstanding, Jonathan Lim who was our server did a wonderful job! He is helpful, funny and very knowledgeable with any questions we ask him about the food! We were all stuffed and contented after dinner.
Every visit that we make in Vegas, Max restaurant is a must!"}
{"text":"Very very very slow service. Reception acts as though they have not been trained to handle a full restaurant. After taking our order we were told by our waiter that our order will be delayed. Good food but badly trained staff.

Management lacks the knowledge of how many servers should be working during peak hours."}
{"text":"The food at Max's is decent. The fried chicken was crispy, well seasoned and delicious, as was the lechon kawali. However, the quality of the food could not make up for the glaring weaknesses in customer service. 

We went on a day where there happened to be a party going on which took up half the restaurant. In this situation some delays are completely understandable but we were left waiting for approximately an hour and fifteen minutes. There was no one at the front of the desk and several families of potential customers came and left, frustrated by the lack of coordination and employee presence as one employee popped in and out of the front desk to hand out take out orders and occasionally jot people names down to await seating. As we waited we clearly saw several booths and tables that were vacant, and there did not seem to be anyone ensuring that these tables were assigned to waiting customers. I understand booking parties is likely an important revenue source for this restaurant but the fact that the party took complete priority over regular customers is absolutely unacceptable. 

Once seated, our waiter was very kind and apologetic and got our food to us as fast as possible, apologizing several times for the delay. This leads me to think that the restaurant is insufficiently staffed or poorly managed. If you can't keep private parties running smoothly while continuing regular operations, should you really be doing both?"}
{"text":"Pros: -manager is really nice
-the place is clean
-the waiters are nice
-family restaurant 
-reasonable prices

Cons:-no reservations
-2-3 hour wait to be seated in which I find my self wandering in the neighbouring Value Village store just to kill time. 
-The food is OK. 
-Extremely crowded and not big enough to accommodate all the tables that have been packed in.

Overall, not a bad place, they just need a better layout."}
{"text":"Great Filipino Restaurant! Chef cooks tasty food! Friendly ambiance!Friendly staffs! You should try Crispy Pata, Bangus Sisig, Laing, Bicol Express and Halo-halo"}
{"text":"This place actually deserves a 3.5 rating. Decent food, good service and clean. It's good for family/friend gatherings because they take reservations. Make sure you reserve a table if you're going on a weekend and for dinner. Lots of parking available in this parking lot. 

I recommend their garlic rice, fried chicken and halo-halo. Their pancit isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"i came here and ordered at least 10 things. I loved every single bite. the service was fast and thorough, Lloyd never let my glass get empty and never made me feel like i had been forgotten. Great service and Great food! i will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"3.5

- adobo chicken - really good but it was on the saltier side
- pork sisig - chopped up pork belly on a sizzling plate, it was on the oily side but it was flavourful when served on rice
- kare kare - peanut butter beef stew - don't think this came out fresh as it was served to use lukewarm. Strong peanut butter flavour that was creamy and the beef chunks was a bit dry
- halo halo was really good! big serving of it as well

We got the ube decadence for free with yelp check in. It has a pudding texture with ube flavours which I enjoyed and it wasn't too sweet

Great place if you're looking for home-cooked style filipino food. This restaurant can accommodate large groups as it was big and quite spacious. Service was OK."}
{"text":"Too expensive for filipino food. Kate Kate was OK nothing spectacular. Beef steak and lechon was good though."}
{"text":"Totally surprised at other reviews that I'm reading as my family's experience here was impeccable!

We came here with my family on a Saturday evening.  We had lumpiang shanghai (egg rolls) and they were SO good, came hot and fresh and loaded with fillings.  We tried their Kamayan feast which is served with stuffed squid, deep fried tofu, eggplants, fried pork, fish, famous Max's chicken and shrimp on a very generous bed of rice.  This experience was truly amazing and authentic to Filipino cuisine.  The chicken was very tender with crispy golden skin and was my favourite.  The foods were freshly made and came piping hot and delicious.

The ambience was good inside the restaurant, you can see the kitchen from any seating area inside.  The staff was very courteous with friendly smiles and the owner himself came to greet and check up on our table personally, which we really appreciated as it showed he truly cares about his patrons.  They also had a bubble tea soft opening inside the restaurant that weekend.  The classic black milk tea was amazing and decently priced, a must try for anyone who pays a visit here in the area!

We look forward to coming back again in the near future."}
{"text":"The fried chicken in this restaurant is nowhere close to how they cooked it in the original Max's, I'd say Max's in Jersey City, NJ is closer to the original.  We also ordered lumpiang sariwa which was ice cold and very expensive.  The kids did not even eat the spaghetti kids meal because it tasted like desert -- it was too sweet even for kids. Their only saving grace is the garlic fried rice.  Overall the food is not worth the price. The food at nearby Seafood City, Grill City is so much better and cheaper.  We'll never go back at this Max's!!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I visited Max's in Las Vegas, and I enjoyed myself each time.  We ordered lechon sisig, garlic fried rice, crispy pata and shrimp sinigang.  Everything tasted authentic and fresh and delicious.  There aren't too many locations near me, I live in L.A. but I enjoyed the food so much that I am willing to drive a distance to be able to enjoy Max's when I am back home."}
{"text":"A well rounded and delicious meal involving Sinigang Shrimp, Beef Kare Karen and Pancit Canton.  Much like previous visits the portions were good.  Unlike previous. Suits the service was much better.  Our server (Kirk) was very pleasant and prompt.  I had under estimated the salad I ordered before the main course, but that's what 'to got boxes are for.  All in all it was better experience than I had anticipated."}
{"text":"dined in with my family a couple of days ago on our 3rd day in vegas. we aren't from town, so it was nice knowing that there was a fancy, sit-in filipino restaurant with a pure quality food aside from the normal fast food Jollibee and Chowking. i have been to the Max's in Baguio, Philippines, so it is safe to say that this one stands almost at par with. great food and great experience. just wish that we have a Max's closer where i live."}
{"text":"I went here twice first time we ordered max's chicken which was good, kare kare- all soup no meat and bland, palabok- also bland, calamari -its fried so it was good and garlic fried rice- ok. Not the best food I've had and thought I should try it again, maybe itll be better. Tried for the second time, ordered sinigang, sisig, max chicken. Well it was all terrible except for the chicken. Sisig was soggy, sinigang was tasteless. The service as usually in this place was horrible and very rude. People here are not accommodating and act oblivious to everything wrong with the place."}
{"text":"So here is my review not in retrospect but in real time from my experience at Max's

To start, it isn't good...was seated and waited for 10 minutes just for someone to acknowledge that I was at the table and ask me what I wanted to drink.  No menu at the table and had to ask the greeter to get menu.  Waited almost another 10 minutes for the water

Server came and introduced himself, ordered a sago and lunch. I don't know if the prep work is different in the USA compared to the Philippines but it doesn't take long to pour the drink toss in the jello and tapioca ...the drink itself is really good and just like I would have back in Manila

The food itself was great...ordered garlic fried rice, half chicken and sisig

Hopefully they get it together so that the experience will match the food"}
{"text":"Haven't visited in a couple of months and when my family and I did to stop and pick-up an order, totally disappointed!  Portions of food got smaller, but the price was still high.  Waited for a while for a pick-up order.  Another disappointment when I checked my credit card statement and discovered Max Restaurant added $5.00 tip for a pick-up order because I didn't cross out the tip space!!!  How rude!!!  My family and I waited so long for a pick-up order and missed a show when we got to our hotel and Max needed us to tip them for their slow service!  OMG!  

My family and I will never come back to Max Restaurant again!  The food and prices are much better and reasonable at Cebu Inasal."}
{"text":"This was my first visit

Service:
I had decided what I wanted to order, but my company needed a minute. I was making, from what I gathered to be, small talk with the server about what I was going to order, and the server gave us more time to decide.

By the time anyone came back to our table, they had brought me my order, while my company still had yet to order. So, I ate while my compay waited for hers.

By the time they came back to the table, it was to tell us that that specific dish wasn't currently available. It had been about 15 minutes later. By this time, we decided to pay and leave.

Food:
I ordered the chicken adobo. This was my first time trying it. I am not going to be criticizing the food, it was tasty. I wasnt aware I would be getting a small chicken in my bowl of stew. This is of my ignorance. It was a good dish."}
{"text":"First time i came to Max's, I can say the overall experience was pleasant. We didnt have to wait long for the food and the service was good. I reccommend this place to anyone who wants filipino food"}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for Mother's Day and the food was fantastic! with the exception of the rice which tasted like it was old and overdone. The Max's Restaurant in Vaughan is much larger and has 10xs better service and restaurant layout. This specific location doesn't carry liquor, which is a bummer as a San Miguel would have been nice on this warm day. 

The servers were set up to fail. There were only two servers working and the line up was out the door. We had a table next to us that wasn't cleared for at least 20 minutes while people stood in line. If they had more servers working they could have had people clearing tables while others tended to customers dining.

We never received water when we sat down, nor were asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. The women's bathroom was rather disgusting and dirty - toilets leaking and just plain gross. 

Good thing I looked at the receipt before we left as gratuity is already baked in. I actually had to ask for the bill after I was handed the portable debit machine - wanted to make sure I was paying for the correct order.

I felt sorry for the servers as they looked stressed out. Layout of the store is rather poor - it's small inside. They probably could fit more people inside if  they ripped out the bench seating and used chairs instead.

All in all, the food was great, the set up for Mother's Day was under par. Would we come here again? Maybe. Likely we will go to the Vaughan location instead. 3 out of 5 stars as the food was great, with the exception of the over done rice. I would have given a 2.5 but that isn't an option and the server was 'trying'."}
{"text":"First time ever eating phillipino food and I was very impressed with this place.  Very clean place and courteous service and excellent food. If you are in Vegas and want to try something new you should def try this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent spot. I like the food and the people. I want to make this review long enough so it doesn't add it as a tip"}
{"text":"I've been to Max's a few times with my family since after the visit I was here, and honestly? It has gotten better for me, the wait times have shortened because the 'hype' of it opening is over. The wait has only been at the most 5-10 minutes, for them to get us a high chair and make sure the table is extra clean. The service has been great as well. They try to check back on you and see if you need anything, if they cannot get what you are looking for they ask another waiter to help out. We didn't have any trouble with the menu and have always enjoyed the food we ordered. 

The food we have gotten is always delicious and hot. Sometimes it may seem like they are taking awhile to prepare our food, but our waiter always comes and tells us that they are making sure the food is yummy. When it does come to our table, the presentation is there. They make it so all the food is reachable, since this place is fit for big families and sharing. They try to take away things that are dirty or plates that are not being used so that we can have more space for our food. The food has never been cold or sad looking. It is always yummy, the chicken is crunchy and the soup we usually get is hot, but not burning our tongues. That we can enjoy the food right when it comes. They try to refill our glasses when they see it getting empty. 

OBVIOUSLY, some Filipinos are still stingy and still think this place needs all kinds of things done to it, but from my experiences and being there with my family. I enjoy the fact that we can order delicious food, sit, and enjoy our meal as a family. Without the trouble of cooking, cleaning, and doing everything else. Plus the prices aren't really that bad for all the food we get. 

I ENJOY MAX'S RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Visited Vegas and went to Max's. Except for their chicken, everything else was bland.  Service at both visits were not up to par.  You get seated right away but it took 15 minutes before they took our drink orders.  When we tried to put in our food order the same time as drinks, the waiter told us we need to wait."}
{"text":"Next best place to Mom's cooking!  Authentic, generous portions and friendly service.  Worth my drive from Summerlin...just wish there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting for 30-45 minutes to get your food, then this is the place for you. Food is so-so. Max's fried chicken looks anemic. Place can be very noisy on busy days. Very slim selection of grilled foods. Mostly fried dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered from uber Eats and they forgot my dressing and the FRIED chicken from my salad. It specifically said house special dressing and macs FRIED chicken...received neither...everything else was pretty good but the BBQ sticks had a weird texture"}
{"text":"Greeted upon entry. The wait time was short about 5-10 mins. Although the restaurant was busy multiple waiters addressed us to see if we were helped already. My only complaint was the food taking a bit for it to arrive. When the food came their food filled the plate. A full plate could satisfy almost customer. We barely have enough room for the leche flan. Easy check out and I would come here again."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 8 for the first time on a weekday. It gets really busy immediately after it opens, so you want to get here a little bit beforehand. We were seated quickly.

We ordered a variety of food, including lechon kawali, garlic rice, palabok, and the specials. The food was really good. It reminded me of home and was heaven in my mouth. The lechon kawali was perfectly crunchy. The palabok was nicely sauced. The entrees cost more than other smaller Filipino restaurants, but I think it's worth it.

The decor of this place is modern and I really like it. It looks clean and well organized. There are also dividers, which I'm assuming can be used for private parties.

The service was okay; it could've been better. The waiter got one of the specials wrong, but it was no biggie.

I recommend Max's, especially to those that want to try Filipino food for the first time."}
{"text":"Let's start this off with this establishment being a one and done for me. Went in for dinner with my family and needless to say, the service was not up to par. Our server did not know what had happened to one of our dishes and the kare-kare we ordered had absolutely no meat at all. I would gladly take my business elsewhere instead of eating in this establishment."}
{"text":"Place is fancy, the staffs were pleasant but damn the food was so sub par. I would never pay those price for that kinda quality of food. It was so bad, i wouldn't go back to try and i usually give a place 2nd chance, but i am just to scarred to go back."}
{"text":"This place is good if your looking for a quick sit down meal! Fast service and reasonable prices. Great experience for those seeking some cuisine from the Philippines!"}
{"text":"Oh man... let me just say that the food we had here was delicious. The service was lacking. That's putting it lightly.  I mean,  they weren't rude. Just S L O W...

We came here for my Dad's birthday. They were not busy at all and it looked like they had more than enough staff and empty tables to accommodate the 5 groups of people waiting for a table (including our party of 6).  We waited about 25 minutes. Not too bad you would think, but when you see the staff just standing around and empty tables you'd think they could sit you right away, but no. There were also several tables not bussed the whole time we were at the restaurant. 

When we finally were seated, we pretty much knew what we were going to order because we looked at the menu while we were waiting for our table. We had the pork sinigang,  lechon kawali,  pancit canton,  daing na bangus,  Max's chicken, large garlic fried rice and small steamed rice. We just ate family style. Everything we had was cooked well and really delicious. My only complaint about that was that the dipping sauce for the lechon kawali was ice cold. 

Now the service. It took us maybe 15 minutes or so before someone came to take our drink order and since we were already aware of the mediocre service we ordered our food as well. We didn't want to wait another 15 minutes to order. 30 minutes later we finally received our food. The kitchen looked busy, but there were maybe 4-5 other tables in the restaurant besides ours. I don't know why it would take that long for our food. 

For dessert I got a buko pandan which I order at their restaurant when I'm in Oahu and my mom got halo halo to share with everyone.  The buko pandan didn't taste the same as the other restaurant in Oahu and wasn't the same green color. It looked really light. It wasn't as coconut tasting as expected. The halo halo was huge and my parents thought it was decent tasting. 

I wish they the service was better because I would go back, but I would rather not have to deal with the slow service. I really like the food here, but it's not worth my time.  Oh and by the way, the tables that had not been bussed when we arrived were still sitting there still not bussed when we left.  I don't think I'll be back unless they fix the service issue."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the plates were super dirty. Bring your own plates lol."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC I was ready for what this place had to offer. I ordered the whole chicken, tapsilog breakfast, Pancit bihon, beef soup, stir fry beef, milkfish breakfast, garlic rice, fried calamari. Out of all these dishes the calamari sucked, they should just stop serving it. Everything else was really good, especially the tapsilog."}
{"text":"Ordered pinakbet normally order this in Max Glendale Ca.  Do not order this I was disappointed with the taste it's dry and not tasty.  Same thing with crispy patA.  Not going back to this Max location.  Max Fried chicken in Glendale Ca is still the best."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open and this week it was their \"soft\" opening, so they were only open from 5-9pm.   This place was packed since it opened and the wait and service brings this down a star.

We tried to make reservations over the phone, not possible.  So we arrive and have to wait another 30 minutes to be seated.  That's fine.  Typical, for a new busy place.  However, once we were seated, it took about another 5-10 minutes for a server to wait on us for drinks and to ask for our orders.

The killer:  We waited over 40 minutes for our food to arrive.   After 30 minutes, I even reminded the waitress about our food, and she had to ask what we ordered again.  I'm almost positive if I didn't remind her, we may have never gotten our dinner.  

What we ordered:

Max's Platter - It came with a quarter chicken (honestly I have had better tasting chicken) along with a choice of two noodles, and rice or fries.  

Kare-kare - Peanut butter based dish with beef/oxtail, and veggies.   It was good but I could tell it was sitting on a counter for awhile, because it gets that solid film over the top as it cools down.   The veggies were a bit too crunchy, the beef was okay but there was not enough.  

Drinks were refill-able.

The place inside was nice and clean though.

Will have to try to review it again when they have their \"grand\" opening."}
{"text":"Good food! Their Fried chicken was so crispy! Their tapsilog and bangsilog with garlic fried rice really satisfied my cravings!
Vern gave us an excellent service!
Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was horrible. After being seated our order was taken within 5 min of sitting down. 
Probably because we all had our menus shut due to the fact that we had a lot of time to look at it while waiting for a table (1hr and 44 min).
This wait made no sense at all. There were hardly any people seated and I would said 90 % of the tables were empty but had not been cleaned from other people who already finished eating and left. 

It started off as fast service when once we were seated. 
Then it went down hill from there. 

30 min until  our drinks came out.

Literally took 1 hour and 20 min to get our food  for 2 people only? What about the other two in our party?! 30 minutes later the other 2 entrees were served. 
Not only that it took over an hour for food but the food didn't come out at one time. This was bad.

I finished my coconut water 30 minutes before the food came out and asked if their were refills. I was told no. Fine I'll take that but I was hoping I would be able to enjoy my drink with my food. 

Half of us were done eating before the other half got their food. I would have rather them just keep the two entrees that were done and serve all 4 of us at the same time. This made no sense. 

Next time I'll just order for pick up. If I do go back."}
{"text":"The overall experience is pleasant. The service is friendly and prompt enough. The food is cholesterol ridden but flavourful.  I had the deep fried chicken, deep fried pig's leg and deep fried pork belly. The Kare Kare and Pancit are pretty good. Definitely worth checking out just for the experience."}
{"text":"Max. Max. Max. Max. Bout damn time you opened up only for me to find out that you still have a lot of kinks to work out based on reviews and word of mouth. So I was thinking  a couple months should give you enough time to get your S***T together.

Fast forward to Monday, January 6th. 7 pm dinner time. 8 of us show up and are seated in a timely manner. So far, service seems legit.

We ordered Garlic Fried Rice, Lechon Kawali, Sizziling Tofu, Chicken Sisig, Pakbet, Sinigang na Baboy, Fried Bangus, and of course, Max's Fried Chicken! We ended our feast with Buko Pandan and Halo-Halo for dessert.

We got our food rather quickly. Again, service seems very good. It was not until we got all our food that the I noticed our server disappeared. We were enjoying our food but was wondering when we were going to get refills on all our drinks. We also wanted to order dessert. I would say we did not see our server for a good 15 minutes. We ended up flagging another server to find out where our server was. 

So he finally comes back to attend to our needs. As I told him that we needed refills and to order dessert, I smell the strong odor of cigarette smoke all over him and his breath as he acknowledged our needs. DUDE! Now we know where he has been. He obviously was on his break smoking. Pop a breath mint or 20. I hope he at least washed his hands. Memo to upper management or whoever is in charge of hiring and training your servers, either you need to do a better job of keeping an eye on your employees or hire better servers! I mean, when somebody goes on break, someone else is supposed to cover temporarily until that person comes back. 

So we get our refills finally and our desserts. At this point, I just wanted to finish and pay up so we can get out of there.

Overall, I was actually impressed at the beginning until our server went on his break. It's such a shame too because the food was 4 star worthy but the service was no better than a 2. So this is where I can justify my rating of 3 at this point in time. Maybe in another couple months or whenever I feel that enough time has passed for you big wigs to finally pay attention to these reviews that have a common theme and actually do something about it, until then I predict your average will not go any higher than a 3.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #8"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open a couple of months, and there should be no excuses for unforgettably lousy service.  The servers were friendly, but do they know what customer service really means?

I came with a friend, and we were both born and grew up in the Philippines.  My parents are from Bulacan and my friend is from Pampanga, and we know good food.

The service:  We waited for about 20 minutes after we were seated, and we had to call someone to complain.  We were told someone would be coming, and we waited another 10 minutes.  We had to flag someone down again.  Finally, someone took the order, and we told him we wanted only water to go with the dishes we ordered.  The water did not come.  Another guy came by to ask what we were drinking, and I said water.  The water still did not come.  So we complained again.  I guess they don't like it when they have to serve only water for drinks which means no tips based on zero price.  So the water finally was served.  About 5 minutes later, the food was finally served.  We felt hurried through dinner since the staff was going to prepare for their own Christmas party that night at the restaurant.  One of them kept wanting to take away the plates even though they still had food in them.  Some of the staff came to our table and were apologetic, but do apologies erase a bad taste in your mouth?

The food:  We ordered the fried chicken, lumpiang sariwa, sinigang na baboy, and halo-halo.  My friend liked the chicken, it was just ordinary for me.  The lumpia was okay, not garlicky the way I like it.  The sinigang na baboy was not sour the way sinigang should be, and not plentiful enough for what they charged.  The halo-halo was average and did not have a lot of ingredients.  I felt like I could have done better at one of the Filipino turo-turo food stores in town.

The ambiance:  How come the bar does not have chairs around it so if people want to hang out, they can sit at the bar?  We were catching a cold draft from where we were sitting, so I stood up to check on the windows and see if the empty tables were warmer.  I put my fleece jacket back on after which an assistant manager type went to the thermostat after a few minutes and adjusted the temperature.  There were empty tables that were not cleaned for a while, it was a Tuesday night and was not really busy, so that really looked terrible.

I celebrated one of my birthdays at Max's in the Philippines back then, and I have good memories from it.  This recent experience at Max's in Las Vegas, sad to say, was memorably bad, and I will not return, nor will I tell my friends that there is a Max's in town.  There is just too much competition in Las Vegas now for great food, and when I want Filipino food, I'll just go to a turo-turo."}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable! Everyone was so nice! The food was good also, it wasn't amazing but it definitely was a hit for me. I also liked the vibe when I came to the restaurant the people we're welcoming. I wouldn't mind coming back here whenever I'm around the area."}
{"text":"First off, probably not the best place if you're trying to be on a diet. There is a lot of oil and salt in many Filipino food and not just this place.

My family went to Max's on Mother's day for dinner and as expected it was pretty busy.We waited about about 30 minutes which is a typical for a restaurant that is busy.

I have to agree with a lot of the reviews here and say the service is pretty bad. We were seated at about 6:45 and our server says he'll be with us shortly. Time passes and it is now 7:10 when our server gets back to us to take our drink and food orders. I'd say that's quite a long time to get back to us from an initial \"I'll be with you guys shortly.\" 

Luckily our food didn't take as long as how long it took to order. We ordered Crispy Pata, BBQ Skewers, Bistek, Sisig, Nilagang Baka, Garlic Rice, and Sweet Potato Fries. I was expecting the meat to be tough like people were saying, but it turned out pretty tender. We all enjoyed what we ate. Although it was odd to have sugar on their Sweet Potato Fries, not bad though.

While we were eating we rarely saw our server and when we did it seemed like he was all over the place in different sections. We were never offered or received any refills on our waters once. It was even hard to flag him down to get the check.

TLDR: Overall we enjoyed the food, but the service could have been better, much better."}
{"text":"Came here with family while visiting from the US and this place is great! Food came out al at the same time and was delicious. They accompanied our party of 13 and were very accommodating. This location is a lot better than the Max's in Jersey City, NJ."}
{"text":"Poor service! The first time my family and I came here I hated the long wait. The staff were not friendly at all. The famous \"fried chicken\" was super dry and was lacking flavors!!! The Kare Kare was just okay. The halo-halo was not good either- more beans than anything.  The garlic fried rice was too oily! I don't think I will ever come back. The food was also over priced.

Another day at max's restaurant...take out service this time . 

So I did give this restaurant Another try...we did take out for Kare Kare and crispy pata. We wanted to try Laing but it wasn't available. We were Greeted right away at the front door. Ordering take out was quick and easy. We were told 15-20 mins but actually took 50 mins of waiting. A lot of people were complaining  that the take out service wAs too slow. Also, seating for dine in also took forever...in a matter of 50 mins the small waiting area that they have was filled with people. Mind you this area was also where the new dishes comes out of the kitchen and take out counter location so it was a busy and crowded area. When we finally received our food there was no apologies that it took so long. The Kare Kare was super expensive for a small container...it was okay. The crispy pata was a decent size. The flavor was bland again! I don't think I'll be coming back anymore. Thanks max for failing me the second time!"}
{"text":"With family in town my parents wanted to take them to a spot they were all familiar with from the Philippines -- Max's. This chain restaurant has locations in the Philippines, US, and Canada. Even though I'm Filipino, I'm not a fan of the cuisine in general. But, this place is ok. 

Highlights of our meal were the signature fried chicken with its crispy, crackly skin; the lechon kawali that could have spent less time in the deep fryer; and the tiny but well seasoned lumpiang Shanghai. The massive ham hock that made up the beer braised pata tim was fork-tender, with subtle hints of sweetness and sour to compliment the gaminess of the meat. It's a large dish that should be shared. Max's inasal -- grilled chicken -- had some decent flavors, particularly the soy sauce with garlic and ginger, but it was another dish that suffered from being too dry. The crabmeat fried rice was heavy on peas and light on crab and the rice was stickier than I prefer in fried rice dishes. 

I wasn't a fan of the crepe-wrapped lumpiang ubod and although my family loves halo halo I've never been a fan of the dessert. I've never understood their fondness for a dessert with so many different ingredients thrown together. Although I did pick at the best parts of it, namely the flan and ube ice cream.

The prices aren't bad either. The seven of us ate family style for a reasonable price per person with boxes and boxes of leftovers. With some minor fine tuning they could be producing some of the better Filipino food in town."}
{"text":"The Adobo is fantastic, and so is the fried chicken. Don't settle for the white tice...have the garlic version. The portions of the meals are perfect, service is great and it's very clean"}
{"text":"Decent food, nothing spectacular but the chicken and crispy pata were the highlight of our meal. I decided to give this restaurant 4 stars because the service was great. Our waiter Lloyd went above and beyond catering to our needs. Had a great sense of humor too !"}
{"text":"Ive eaten at this location and a few other locations in the past. The food is consistently good, considering this is a chain. The restaurant is clean and employees are friendly. I can't justify giving them 4 stars due to the fact that the service is just not stellar. We had our waiter completely forget what we ordered and came back to double check before he punched it in to the computers. We've had to ask for napkins, straws, our waters to be refilled etc. Once, I had to ask for lechon sauce 3 times before I received it. And I'm not fond of the fact that you have to pay for rice separately. 

Now with the negatives out of the way, I can go on to the food. We have our go-to dishes, which include: 

Pork sinigang: sour tamarind broth with chunks of pork, bokchoy, egg plant and string beans. I love how sour they make it and appreciate the little kick of heat with the added Serrano pepper. 

Kare kare: peanut based stew with beef and oxtail, bokchoy and eggplant served with a salty shrimp paste. This is my favorite Filipino dish of all time, so I was a little disappointed that it lacked the peanut flavor I was used to. 

Fried chicken: of course, what they are known for. The chicken is served with fresh fries on the side. All I have to say is, that CHICKEN SKIN though! 

Lechon kawali: deep fried chunks of pork belly served with the famous Mang Tomas sauce. You can't go wrong with fried anything, especially pork. 

Halo Halo: the famous Filipino dessert. They definitely don't skimp on the toppings!! One of my favorite places to get halo halo! 

This is a great restaurant to have a nice meal with family or friends. And I appreciate the chef coming out and chatting with us. I would not be opposed if someone wanted to eat here again."}
{"text":"When I found out this place was opening in Vegas, I was pretty thrilled. Being Filipino, you HAVE to know what Max's Chicken is! If you don't than you need to change your ethnicity! Lol ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

I've had Max's Chicken in California but today was the first time I had it in Vegas. This place is pretty spiffy! The inside is really nice. Big broad windows, individual rooms for large parties, very spacious! I'm very impressed with the layout especially in that part of town. 

For food-- we had ordered: fried chicken (duh), Kare Kare, Sisig, Sizzling Tofu, caldereta, and Sinigang. All were pretty good. They are known for the chicken so I had no complaints about it especially if you dip it in banana ketchup! Yum! Other foods, I've honestly had better. The sizzling tofu was probably the only thing I would come back & order again. It had a good kick to it & the sauce they served it with was awesome. The Sisig didn't taste like any kind I have ever had. Kare Kare was alright, had better. 

Also, the soda they served us was flat. Even told them it was, they brought another round of soda.. Which was also flat. Took forever to get a round of water for everyone. My glass of water was empty for a while before someone noticed and filled it. 

They don't include gratuity on the bill even with large parties which I thought was different but they do show what you SHOULD tip at the bottom of the receipt."}
{"text":"Love this place! This restaurant is awesome love their food and I'm not going to single out one person because their staff are so kind and very attentive. The only complaint I have is some of the customers are rude, stuck up, as if they beep, beep don't stink. Please be kind to the customer service staff because they work so hard to serve us. Please do not look down upon them as if they are low class citizens. Remember where we all came from and be kind."}
{"text":"I think this place is great and they should expand.  I find some of the comments here misleading, expensive? Are you kidding me? It's average price for a filipino restaurant that is not take out.... You actually get served here.  Not sure where you guys eat when going out, but the usual chain restaurant's entrees are approximately 20 dollars each.  The flavour  of the food is fantastic (albeit, I don't like the palabok) but the taste is very authentic.  The chicken is an acquired taste? What blasphemy is that? It is the best fried chicken because it is crisp; it is similar to the carribean fried chicken - guyanese style, which I love.  My only problem is the service, they are slow."}
{"text":"Got seated in less than 5 minutes, food came out quickly and was tasty.
I order the Shanghai Lumpia which came in a great eatable fried wrapper dish, the pancit bihon, an order of the chicken sisig (will not recommend), an order of the full max's chicken (which was great), an order of palabok, an order of the crispy pata, and an order of the spaghetti (which was too sweet and cheesy for my likeness).

For the most part service was good. Great first time experience."}
{"text":"one word to describe this place is SLOW.

The greeter at the front, keeps guest waiting when there are empty tables available.

the waiters are slow, the tables are not cleared at a timely matter. takes them awhile to come around.

Not really good Filipino food, small portions and overpriced for what it is.

The pork sisig was greasy, mushy, and no crunch in it.
the fried chicken is very basic, dry, no taste, needs sauce, overpriced, I'd rather have popeyes chicken any day over this.
the rice seems like a lot, but it's not and gone in a second, overprice also.
I've been here a few times and tried almost every dish (it's best to come here in a large group or with family to share)
nothing really stands out besides the halo halo 

there are not a lot of choices for Filipino food, but if it's not too far away, I'd suggest Casa Manila over this."}
{"text":"I've had Max's Restaurant in the Philippines. It's not the same here in Toronto. 

The service was outstanding in one of the Manila restaurants. 
The food also tasted much more fresh. 

The prices are not reasonable for the quality of food and service. 
Though, to be fair, there aren't many Filipino restaurants in the area. The competition simply isn't high enough for Filipino food. 

I came in for dinner after seeing a raptors game advertisement on yelp. Excited to have Filipino food and watch the raptors game, I came in with good expectations.

They #1 did not play the game and after my request to switch the channel twice, they did.

After they changed the channel, they left the TVs at 0 volume. I needed to request EIGHT TIMES before they actually made it restaurant volume - you know, to the point where I don't hear dishes, forks and knives tapping each other. It was so awkward. Everyone in the restaurant wanted to watch it too.

I won't be back unless I'm feeling like halo halo- which is not a bad dessert."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot of work for sure! The servers were friendly but everyone needs more training. I took my family here for my birthday. The wait to be seated was not that bad. However, the wait to get our food felt really long. I really did not like the fact that they did not build our order, they simply brought our food almost one by one. Our sizzling pork sisig came first and the others took a couple more minutes to get to our table. By the time the rest of the food came the sisig was not hot anymore. I was also very disappointed with the pancit canton. It was very watery and and it lacked flavor. The only good food that we ordered was the chicken everything else was just eh ok. 

I know opening a restaurant is tough but come on you are in Vegas and just a few minutes from the strip! I am giving this place 3 stars just because it's Max's Restaurant. If I was not familiar with the brand I would give this place a 1.5 because I know they could do a lot better. 

Tips:
- Train all of your staff according to industry standards.
- The kitchen needs to run quicker.
- The servers needs to learn how to juggle their tables better.
- The food needs better flavors (it lacks a lot of flavor).
- Build the orders (don't just bring out one dish but bring them all together).
- Please please please train each and every single employee better."}
{"text":"My first try at Filipino quisine and loved it! The adobo chicken was spectacular as well as the eggeolls!!!"}
{"text":"Very slow service unfortunately largely due to the the place being packed and noisy.  We had to walk up to the waiter ourselves to get the dessert and the bill.  The restaurant is famous for its whole fried chicken which was good. The serving size in general could be better and it was a bit pricy for what it is. The food wasn't bad but we do prefer Casa Manila significantly more."}
{"text":"we have ate at Max's in the Philippines , it was refreshing that you had all Filipino employees helped it really made it feel authentic at Las Vegas store. Our server was 'Von'' the service was very good...Von was very friendly and nice. The food and service was excellent ..My husband and I enjoyed it!! You will see us again...
 signed: RUBY AND JOHN SCHWALLIER!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. authentic filipino food. Will recommend Nilagang baka, Lumpiang Shanghai and crispy pata. Lumpiang ubod was fresh and really good too. Service here is also exellent and fast. Awesome service by Rocky and gilbert. Rocky was always attentive and was always smiling and always asking if we need anything. Both rocky and gilbert thank you for providing us with an awesome service and made our experience here a definitely 5 star service!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was just good.  Really nothing particularly special although I did enjoy it.
I am a tipper normally but it did really irk me that for a table for 4 and a $108 bill they had added a 10% gratuity.  I just find this unacceptable.  I did put an extra tip on there because it is not the fault of the friendly servers.   I believe that tipping should be for services rendered that YOU have decided were good not taken upon the company to decide for you.
Otherwise a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not as good as I had hoped. The service was great and they do everything that they can to accommodate you.  

I had the Beef Sig Sig , Garlic Rice and Halo Halo. All were fine and good but could have been better.  If you want a really good Halo Halo in Vegas, it is hard to beat Sasasweets Chillspot in the Container Park. 

Will I go back to try new things, Yes. Just cause they make certain Filipino dishes ok doesn't mean they are all bad.

IMO - They have a great platform and would like to see them expand to try and make a healthier Filipino food because face it... A lot of our food isn't that healthy... I wish it was.  I think they would benefit from this, so we will see."}
{"text":"Loved Halo Halo oh my so refreshing and for the first time i tried fresh ubod lumpia it was delicious.  Friendly staff and clean invironmanent so i will be back again"}
{"text":"This Max's restaurant is quiet big compare from to their California brunches. The service is faster and its not crowded for lunch time. My family and I went here for lunch and they were satisfied about the food. We order the usual Max's stuff... like fried chicken is a must!!! Same for the crispy pata and sisig!!! Their fresh lumpia is so damn delicious and of course halo halo for dessert.. Really?! Good way to represent the Filipino food culture that's for sure. Definitely going back again if we go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"PLEASE NOTE: the phone number on here is wrong...the address is right.

I was brought here on my birthday.

I was surprised that I did not have to wait very long for a table. Reservations are not accepted on the weekends. I braced myself and my party of 3 for a long wait because all tables were full. But within 5 minutes we were seated, the wait staff also accommodated the fact my bf had crutches. (bigger table area).

We ordered our drinks 2 pepsi's and water.

We had the sampler (I forgot what its called) plate. Which had lumpia shanghai, calamari, and vinegar.

Then we ordered sizzling pork sisig (it was good), 2 large orders of rice (its rice its good!), pinakbet (very tasty if you enjoy okra, squash, bitter melon, pork, shrimp, and shrimp paste), Med order of crispy pata (good for 3 people and very tasty!!!), and a whole chicken(Chicken is what this place is known for but I give it 3 out of 5 stars) 
The reason the chicken scored so low is...My Dad does the exact same thing at home. I thought there was something else to it..but I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal. And we also ordered 2 halo halos..YUMMM! PLEASE note they also do it in a take out version if you already know you cant have it at the table but still want it...(learned it the hard way lol)

The restaurant was clean in appearance, also there wash rooms.

I wish they would give each patron who orders crispy pata their own dipping container, I have no problem sharing but its not enough for let alone one person...

I did enjoy myself there the plaza has alot of parking but then again I went at night close to its closing hours (we did not realize that but we were not rushed, and the restaurant was still full.)

I feel I have to say it is not fair to compare other filipino restaurants to one another because remember there are alot of different regions, and different ways, methods of cooking for example dinuguan I was raised with it having a nice \"sabow\" at another filipino store where I go they always have this dry looking version but still sells out. Its like comparing green apples or red apples, ITS still apples!. 

I still need to go back to figure out if it is worthy of a 5 star for me, but I am still happy and satisfied with their customer service, and food I presented with."}
{"text":"Poor Customer service, I was here yesterday. Rain pouring hard and The Only thing you wish for is To indulge yourself with some sinigang soup and  dessert with buko pandan.Two person working at The cashier's Area with  may be 3-4 customers inside including the One paying. It took them 10 minutes To ask If Its ok To wait 20-25 minutes. Really!?? As If Its crowded and full?"}
{"text":"I love going to this place for some comfort Filipino food! The garlic rice and halo-halo is a must if you come here! Service is great and food is always consistent. The sweet potato fries are very addicting and you get a handful with your chicken. This place is great for large parties and there is ample parking. Yelp almost always has a deal for Max's too!"}
{"text":"Ask a person who grew up in the Philippines about Max's and you'll get a mixed bag of responses. I think this place is really polarizing.

First, the good things: If you were to ask me what restaurant in the GTA puts Filipino cuisine's best foot forward and I would say this is the place. Apart from the fried chicken (which is an acquired taste), there are notable Filipino dishes: crispy pata, sinigang, sizzling tofu, and tapsilog.

But where Max's falters is value for money: I (and other people I know who ate at Max's) feel that the prices are unnecessarily expensive and my theory is that Max's really wants to extract the most value from its customers because I think (a) it's in a fairly odd location in Vaughn and (b) most customers flock only during weekends.

But I must say that the one thing most people would agree on is that Max's gets the halo-halo dessert right.

My pro tip: to enjoy Max's to the fullest, go there during weekdays and order at least the fried chicken and the halo-halo."}
{"text":"I've experience Max's in the Philippines and in San Diego, this by far was the best overall Restaurant. They really did a nice job with the layout. From the fireplace to the bar with flatscreen TVs to the updated decor I give them props. The food and service equally matched the look of the restaurant. Chicken was crispy and moist, the garlic rice was like no other. Definitely my go to place when I'm craving Filipino food in the city of sin."}
{"text":"Before a roadtrip back to LA, my friends family and I (they're Filipino) stopped here for brunch. They knew what was good so I just let them order. 

They got the fried chicken, egg noodle pancit, fresh spring rolls, egg rolls,garlic rice,  and milk fish. (Sorry I can't remember the names of the dishes) 

All of them tasted good! The sauce for the spring roll could be better in my opinion but for the amount of food we got (which was a lot), it was a great meal. 

We also got halo halo and the coconut jelly dessert at the end which were both delicious! The staff were very attentive and nice. Got really busy fast. 

CHICKEN - tender, crispy, and seasoned right. Came with fries. Fries were okay. Soggy. 

PANCIT - couldn't tell it was different from a regular noodle stir fry. I've had rice noodle pancit before, so maybe that is why. 

EGG ROLLS - very crispy. Good portions. It seemed like it was the frozen kind and not made there looking at the filling (sausage-y?) but idk if it's suppose to be like that. 

SPRING ROLLS - Filled with bamboo shoots. MUST eat with the peanut sauce or its kind of plain. 

GARLIC RICE - Smelled so good when it came. Every bite you can taste the fragrance of delicious garlic. 

MILK FISH - ask for extra lemons. Great with it. Kind of oily, but sill very good. Lots of onions. 

I would come here again if I get the chance :)"}
{"text":"Food's a 3. Service is a 4, but glitchy. Price could be much cheaper. 

We ordered the Max's basic (garlic rice, 1/4 fried chicken, caramel bar) for $9.99 and the tapsilog (garlic rice, sauced fried sirloin, 2 eggs) for $9.99. We also checked in on Yelp, so we got an ube decadence dessert for free. 

Mom's garlic rice was a scoop of rice and a small/medium sized fried chicken leg on a plate. There was a strip of banana leaf as decoration, but other than that, it was a pretty empty looking plate. The chicken was crispy and tasty, but a tad on the dry side. If you're not into batters and breading, this is the fried chicken for you. There was next to no breading/batter on it at all.

My tapsilog was better, but not perfect. They brought me bangus instead of beef the first time, and I quickly told them they got my order wrong. On that plate, I had ordered my eggs sunny side up, and noticed that one of the egg yolks on the plate with bangus had popped. They took the bangus plate back in, apologized, and then a few minutes later, brought out my tapsilog. On this plate, one of the eggs was also popped. One of two things happened. Either their chef isn't the best at making sunny side up eggs, or they just switched out the bangus for the tapsilog and gave me the same used plate. Either way, that's a bit of an issue. The garlic rice was good, as were the eggs, but the beef, while tasty, was salty to the point that I drowned it in vinegar and ate it with copious amounts of rice to mask the salt. It worked, but only to a certain extent. 

When the waiter took my plate, he dropped my cutlery and it actually hit me on the way down. Thankfully, none on the Nobis. 

On to dessert. No caramel bar. Instead, mom got a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a chunk of leche flan. Score for us, although I'd have rather had a non-vanilla flavor of ice cream. Leche flan was rather dense, but delicious. The ube decadence was not quite decadent. The leche flan was more decadent. It was also not particularly strong on the ube. It looked like a milk pudding topped with chocolate cake crumbs. Inside is ube paste, but the ube paste isn't that bright purple one is accustomed to finding with ube. It's more natural colored and textured. While tasty, I wouldn't order it for its menu price of $4.99.

All in all, while the restaurant was clean and service was good, I've had food of equal quality and service for significantly less than I could get it here, so I won't go out of my way to come again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The wait staff almost out shined the food. The Kari Kari was delish and the lupia rolls were life changing"}
{"text":"Had the Bicol pork; fried pork belly in coconut sauce. I had mine over the garlic rice. Very tasty. The order would have fed two easily. 
Service was very good, wait staff friendly. 
A little pricey, but it is a lot."}
{"text":"I went here with 9 other people, and the service that was provided was pretty good. The food was delicious and came nice and hot as well as quickly. I should note that there were already plenty of customers present before we all got seated. The service could have been a little bit faster but the food was decent enough for it not to be an issue."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time since it opened with my sister. We went around 5 or 6. The wait wasn't bad, when we came in the girl immediately asked \" for two? \" I'm a hotel management student, and that was a bad greeting, she didn't say welcome or anything like that. 
The place wasn't busy as it was still early for dinner. The server came and asked for drinks, and when they know you speak tagalog, they will talk to you in tagalog. We ordered, food came in a pretty good time, but the server brought it one by one, and when he served the sinigang he was holding the bowl on the top side, which wasn't supposed to be because his finger was close to the food.
It was a good experience. Good food, but I didn't see any chicken on the menu, maybe i just flipped the pages too fast."}
{"text":"Say yes to halo halo and the ube creme brulee

My friends and I came here after skipping desert at 168..because I HAD TO HAVE THE ULTIMATE...HALO HALO.

Oh girl. Couldn't wait.

We got into the resto, and were seated promptly.


The servers were super super nice (ofcourse, philipino style!)

We took a look at the menu just for jokes. We know what we canem here for.


BRING ON DA HALO HALO.


It came out 10 minutes later.

All purple and green and red and delicious.


THE UBE ICE CREAM WAS FUCKING FANTASTIC.

Everything was amazing. No qualms. Wish it was a tad bit sweeter, but thats a good thing.

The Ube Panacotta was amazing too. So sweet and deliciously purple.

Will definitely come back here to try the famous chicken!"}
{"text":"This place is great! This was my first time having Philippino food, but it will definitely not be my last. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, advising us on the favorite items on the menu. The prices are very reasonable, and we were given a whole complimentary chicken. That's right folks, because it was our first time in the restaurant they gave us a whole chicken for free! This place rocks. 10/10, would come again."}
{"text":"Love Max's, this location never disappoints. Service is friendly and atmosphere is great.  I will say that the quality of food at Max's in South San Francisco and Milipitas is still a little better than this location."}
{"text":"I am on a diet and this place has thee best tasting and healthy food around me,service is a little slow so defiantly not a come and leave fast type of place, but definitely worth it and affordable, I will be back many times."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is their speciality. This is the first time we're I got up and went strait to the toilet to puke! The fried chicken was very oily in a weird way that makes you just want to trow up. Very bad experience I don't recomend."}
{"text":"Great authentic Filipino cuisine. The pork adobo was amazing and the halo halo topped my meal off. I had the canton pancit, but it wasn't my favorite. I was a little disappointed that rice wasn't included in my meal and I had to order it separately. Also, the restaurant is off the strip so finding a taxi back was impossible. In all I definitely recommend that you visit this restaurant when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you got time to kill and initially you're not as hungry,  then this would be the perfect restaurant for you. You'll be waiting on your table for so long that by the time your server comes (if you're even that lucky to get one to take your order) you'll be starving by then. Service is horrible!!  I've had better service at a hot dog stand than this place. 
Don't get me wrong the food is delicious and super tasty but don't waste your time eating inside the restaurant. Order over the phone and do carry out. I'll never ever ever come back to this restaurant even if you were to pay me to go. I don't understand why there's like 10 guys on the floor and our server only had 2 tables (that's including us)  and he told us twice he'll be back to take our order. Yeah right!  I think I have a better chance winning the lotto than to ever get my order taken.  I'm so upset this happened especially how slow it was at 3pm on a Friday. My family and I got up and left!  Get your act together management!  Your employees performance is ruining your reputation!!"}
{"text":"Great food fast and friendly service stopped here on the way back from a camping trip and my friends and I wanted something quick and filling. This was perfect! It is different but don't be afraid very worth it!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at Max's was for my sister's graduation back in the Philippines. It's been a while, but my palate have a very good memory. I was so excited to try this place out because it was one of my favorite chain restaurant back home, so I coerced my dad to go here with me after we did some grocery shopping over at Seafood City; We both were highly disappointed with this place. It's nothing like the Max's back home. Ok, maybe their chicken was good but that's about it. We ordered sisig, which turned out to be mediocre, had some lumpiang ubod which tasted fake, and their pancit bihon and the spaghetti that came with my daughter's kid's meal tasted like how instant ramen noodles taste like; My daughter pushed her plate away and said it was yucky and tasted like goop and paste. And the server we had wasn't good as well. I work in the restaurant industry and I always feel bad giving bad tips to servers but I barely wanted to give our server a tip. He was rushing us with our food, was talking to us condescendingly, and was rude and gave us bad attitude when my daughter accidentally spilled her drink on the table, and let me cleaned up after her without even offering me extra napkins or towels to wipe it up. All this happened while the restaurant was almost empty. I'm really disappointed. Hopefully they train their staff better and do something about their food."}
{"text":"Home grown mom and pop Filipino restaurants in Vegas are much better. Came her in June 2017. A week later the health department closed the store for awhile. I can only imagine. Made me throw up. Saw it on the news all the way in San Diego. Max's in the Philippines are the bomb. State side Max's not so much."}
{"text":"As a Filipino, I felt obligated to come here. I mean, my default Yelp search bar says \"Find: tacos, cheap dinner, MAX'S\"! You can say it was kinda in my face.

I recommended Max's to my friend to have his birthday celebration at. As the only Filipino there, everyone asked me what to get. Remembering what my relatives in the Philippines told me, I advised them to try the fried chicken. I followed that same advice and got the Half Chicken Dinner. 

The chicken's skin was good, great even. It was seasoned to perfection and I couldn't get enough of it. I can't say the same for the actual meat, though. While still satisfactory, it was on the dry side and wasn't special. I was surprised with how little rice they provided with the dish. Anyone that knows a Filipino knows how important rice is to every dish, yet the portion of rice given was only a little more than five spoonfuls. I'm not too much of a fan of rice myself so I didn't mind, but I can see how this can bother other people. 

TL;DR? The chicken here is definitely worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased since I was born and raised living Max Philippines, but this place was utter perfection! Attentive service, clean despite under reservations, and a nice place to dine in! Definitely order the chicken and kare kare because it was definitely worth!"}
{"text":"Came today and try this new resto. Iam full pinoy and my standard of pinoy food is simple and basic: if my grandma and mother can cook better, it should not be served on restuarants. 

We ordered 8 things in the menu;
Chicken
Sinigang na hipon
Lechon kawali
Nilaga
Chicken sisig
Pork sisig
Pancit miki bihon 
Laing

In this 8 items only the laing is what my mom and grandma dont cook. Anyways lets start with the good, the chicken. Its one of the best crunchy and flavored chicken we had in restuarants, my mom agreed its good, and I liked it too.

Unfortunately thats where the good things stops. The other 6 items (excluding laing which was okay regarding to my family, i have no taste for it.) So for the bland foods are the following; pancit and nilaga. It was so bland i have to use 1 spoon full of condiments to make them taste anything. The nilaga was served cold too. Next the super salty are the following; kawali, pork sisig, chicken sisig, all of this items have strong salty taste, too salty that we were not able to eat them all. The last one the hipon na sinigang, they got the \"asim\" (TANGY) part but they did not catch other flavor than that. This sinigang is missing that unique sinigang flavor.

In the end i was only able to enjoy my plate due to the chicken that was really good. When i was over, i had a full bowl of the soups (untouched) pancit on the side which i tasted only once, the sisigs were just next to my pancit and the other stuff making my entire plate half full. 

Oh i would like to add it took the food to come in 35 minutes. I finished the freaking 1 episode of a tv series before they come all together. Which i think is the reason why our soups were cold, if iam not wrong it means that the soups were sitting on the counter but they were waiting for all the foods to be finished before serving them. 

In the end Max didnt deliver the filipino food that i expected. Back home they are known for the chicken, i guess they should only stick with that. There are better less known restaurants with real flavored, well served, authentic filipino cuisine around.

Update: last time we went here they had 5 stars it's down to 3 now. Not surprise."}
{"text":"after the longest wait ever max's is finally open! when we got there we weren't sure if they were open or not (no signs or banners only a very small open sign on the front door) so we decided to just check it out! lo and behold they just opened! the staff was super friendly and the chicken is as always superb! unfortunately (and according to our very friendly server Buddy) they are only open for dinner for now...meaning from 5:30  pm to about 10:00 pm... aside from the chicken the rest of the food we ordered (pork sisig, lumpia sariwa, kare kare, and pansit guisado) needs a wee bit more seasoning but all in all it was a very nice meal and i can only imagine that since this looks to be only a soft opening of the place, it can onlu get better! will definitely come back again soon!"}
{"text":"There's only one thing you need to order from Max's... Beef sisig!!! I had it twice while in Las Vegas and every bite was orgasmic. It really and truly was a dish that got my uber excited thinking about it. 

Side note --- some of this dish somehow made it home from Las Vegas to Virginia Beach. Translation... I had more beef sisig for tonight's dinner. Translation... The orgasmic sensations continued.

Now if I were to throw in my two cents on everything else, this review would be four stars but when you follow my lead and go for only the beef sisig, you won't be disappointed and I hope you'll feel as excited as I am!"}
{"text":"We waited half an hour for a table. Its been 45 minutes and we are still waiting for our food. They know its a Saturday and lunch rush. They should be more prepared. The table that was ahead us already got their food. And they ordered the sane food as us. And there goes another table with there food. Bad service."}
{"text":"Went there this evening for my birthday dinner. I had grown up in the Philippines and my boyfriend thought he would treat me. The food was good, however the waitress was so slow that we were there for an hour and a half before we got our check.

She was unable to provide recommendations on food, never asked how we were, and why did we came. We waited for water, we finished our appetizer way before our food came, we still waited for our water after the food came.

I originally wanted to have the Halo-Halo, but after that lousy service, I just wanted to leave. I felt bad because I really wanted this to be a good experience"}
{"text":"I alway love Max Restaurant, first time trying this location. 
The food is ok, good price, pancit canton is a little dry, fried chicken is superb, crispy pata is under cooked IMO.

Im not sure if they are short on servers, but we only saw our waitress 2 times, first when she got our order and next is when she brought our food. We have to chase somebody around for a refill of drinks and to place additional order. There is definitely a room for improvement in that area.

I will give this place another try and hope service gets better."}
{"text":"Terrible service. You'll starve waiting for your order.  Ita not even busy, lots of empty tables. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The star is for the halo-halo only other than that, service was terrible. If you're ever in vegas, i don't recommend this Max's. Food was tasteless, greasy plus really terrible waiters. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"The opening of this legendary  chicken specialty restaurant in Scarborough has been awaited by many  so I'm quite surprised this is the first review written. We came  at dinner time in early May shortly after they opened up and  the place was packed by the \"curious to try\" 
crowd. Not a table free in the house so we decided to do takeout and joined the growing takeout line on the side. After a good 20 minutes of waiting in the takeout line, a  few tables freed up and we were quickly ushered to one by the servers. Unfortunately, the food was not that quick and it took another 20 minutes for our order arrive:  an order of whole chicken, pancit canton, garlic fried rice and chopsuey.  Cashier was unable  to switch our takeout order to an eat-in so it languished in the takeout cue and our order was actually taken to our table in takeout bags  and containers! After 40 minutes! Fortunately, the food was good...the chicken true to its legendary flavour and fall off the bone crispness, the pancit canton and garlic fried rice savoury but the chopsuey just so-so. Their menu was not yet extensive and may yet expand but Max has really got to manage their takeout ordering (both walk in and call in) and walk in patrons  much better as the long wait is not acceptable and will keep potential repeat customers away. Great as the food may be, I cannot take my Canadian friends there and be embarrassed by the long wait time. It seemed that on their first few  \" soft opening\" weeks as they called it, Max Scarborough couldn't competently handle the volume of eat in, walk in and call in patrons. I hope they have improved since then."}
{"text":"PArty of four. Service was great. The bar was depleted a bit but we found plenty to drink other than wine. The food was all tasty and fresh.  Cost is good value for money thus the four stars. You can pay more and get better quality but for the price it was all good.  I recommend for others and will return."}
{"text":"Looooooooooooooooooong wait. We've waited 30mins. To get seated and more than an hr for our food. I'm freaking hungry. I understand that they're busy but what I can see is they're prioritizing the to go's. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We were in the area trying Raising Cane's & saw that there was a Max's nearby.

Previous reviews stated that it had a C rating but when we went on 06/24/17, they had a A rating.

The restaurant was slow & we just had a simple to go order: Halo-Halo.  There were a few people waiting ahead of us for to go orders & a few of them complained that it was taking awhile.  & they were not wrong to complain because it took them 20 minutes to make our Halo-Halo!  & if you know what that it, then you know that they literally just had to grab a cup & pile ingredients into it.  They did not need to cook or bake anything but it still took them that long.

The Halo-Halo was good but not for a 20 minute wait!"}
{"text":"The food is not that great just okay, the best thing to do is not go here for some pinoy food. The sisig is over cook and dip in oil, the fried rice is to oily, the chocolate meat is to runny, you know what just don't come here it sucks!"}
{"text":"Placed my to go order with the host, Ronnelle,, and ordered some macapuno ice cream while I waited.  He said I could go to the bar and have it there while I waited. Came right before the dinner rush, so they're starting to get busy. But, I've been waiting. Nathan finally came up to me, and my 2 scoops of macapuno ice cream came out. Yay!"}
{"text":"Lunch today with the family. Came in at around 1:30 and was told by the hostess that there's a 30-35 min wait for a party of 3. James, one of the staff, told the hostess to open a section and we were seated in less than 5 mins. James also took our order even though he's not our server. Way to go James. Max's is fortunate to have you. Thanks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! Me & my family always make it a thing to come here & eat when we go to Vegas! It's not too far from the strip, very clean place, good atmosphere, & most importantly the food, drinks & desserts are all amazing!! We've tried many different things on the menu & haven't been disappointed, I seem to have a new favorite every time haha! Today we tried the tofu con lechon & the beef kaldereta, & of course had halo halo for dessert! (My mom got to the halo halo before I could snap a good picture lol)"}
{"text":"If there's a \"zero\" or a even a negative five, I would!....Service was really bad. I took my parents to this restaurant, really excited to see how they can match or perhaps surpass the service in Glendale, CA ...BUT! NOT!! Supervisor/manager was unhelpful. Unbelievable! this Manager needs to be Fired!...actually I'm calling the Corporate office regarding our interaction. 
It took them a long time to give me back my credit card. I even had to asked them what happened to it. It took them a good 30 mins to give me back my card!"}
{"text":"Always gonna be my favorite fried chicken!! Cant get enough of this. Super love their kare-kare, pancit canton, lumpiang shanghao and sinigang!!! This will always be my favorite comfort food."}
{"text":"You might not think to come here for fried chicken, but if you didn't, you'd be missing out on a real treat. The chicken is perfectly cooked and fried to a light, delicious crisp. The noodle dish makes an excellent side, and the spring rolls a great app. There's also a large pork dish that is quite tasty as well. The downside is that when they're busy, they're BUSY, so seating can be a problem at peak times. Plan your visit accordingly."}
{"text":"Way over priced. \"Famous chicken\" was tasteless. Other food was served late and cold. We were very disappointed, spending over $150 (including mandatory 15% tip) for six people without drinks n deserts. Not at all like Max's in the Philippines where the food is good and very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've dined in here 5 times since it opened and 3 out of those 5 did not prove to be a great dining experience. The last 3 were the most disappointing ones. Although the prices here are decent, I'd much rather go to a local Filipino place that serves authentic, great tasting food (just like back home) .. With faster, more friendly service. 

Appetizers came along with the entrees, and rice came in last. The sinigang was too salty, although it had that distinct sour taste I was looking for. The grilled pork (liempo) we had ordered had to be sent back by myself since all the chopped up pieces were half-cooked (if not raw at all) The server was always nowhere to be found, drinks took forever to get filled. Overall poor dining experience and food wasn't up to par.

Definitely not coming back!"}
{"text":"Too much batter or something.  Not nearly as good as in the Philippines, not even enough to really give that nostalgia feel.  It's okay though - I'm not gonna totally diss and drop below 3 stars."}
{"text":"Customer service is okay and for such a big place they should be seating more people at once. 
But other than that the food is great the fried chicken is bomb."}
{"text":"Small servings and expensive.  but the food is great. I love the lechong kawali, tapsilog and daing na bangus."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, we were craving for Max's chicken because we don't have it there. It tastes very authentic. I can't say enough but it's on point. 

We tried the classic pork sisig and sad to say, it's more like onion sisig, not much meat or pork there. 

I commend the customer service in our servant Jason. He's a perfect example of what the standard of customer service should be. 

So the verdict, for the classic pinoy chicken, it's a go. For anything else, it's a gamble."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this particular branch of Max. I have eaten at other Max restaurant in the Philippines, New Jersey and California and their food fails miserably in comparison to other Maxs.  I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but I heard from the locals that even though this restaurant is new, that they been opened for quite some time.  The only reason they got two stars is the super friendly host/cashier and the cleanliness of the restaurant as they're fairly new. We came in the restaurant a little over 40 minutes before closing but there were still quite a few people in the restaurant.  They gave us menus and never came back.  After a long while I wave at one of the waiters to let them know we were ready to order.  It took a few more minutes before we got somebody to take our order.  Mind you the place is only half full.  Anyways we ordered Bulalo, Pork sisig and Bicol express.  The Bulalo was ok, the dish wasn't even hot. The Bicol express was suppose to be spicy as indicated by the menu but this wasn't the case at all.  The sisig was bland, again not even hot.  I would have preferred that they stick this dishes in the microwave before serving them, that would have been acceptable for me.  We ordered some gulaman/sago drink. It was good but for 3 plus dollars i should at least get a bigger glass not a dollars worth of this drink.  If you think it was hard getting somebody to take an order, good luck getting somebody to get you some ice water. NOBODY checked on us to see how we were doing.  And they have the nerve to automatically charged you 10% tip on your bill. No wonder they make it a standard as nobody would leave them a tip as their service sucks.  I'm willing to pay and have paid more for food and service but this place doesn't deserve it.  It will be really hard for me to comeback to this place unless the locals says they've changed."}
{"text":"The food here is great!! Prices are great!!!! Staff is Great!!!! Make time to stop by if your ever in vegas"}
{"text":"We ate here last night. We were craving for lumpiang sariwa the server said they runout and when we asked them how long it's been out they said it's been a week. We were so disappointed because that was the reason why we went there. We ordered Kare Kare not the best one, sisig have too much vinegar, daing na bangus was good but the atshara has no taste at all, the fried chicken wasn't that bad and the halo halo was ok. I gave 2 star for the servers even though they forgot to bring out soup that's included with order and  I have to remind them. They apologized so many times but we suggested that if they have the lumpia they should cross it out from the menu. Not probably our choice to eat again."}
{"text":"Parking is ample, the place looks brand new. We were seated quickly. Will come back again next time we visit Las Vegas. Feels like we're back vacationing in the Philippines.. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Kaye is so helpful. We couldnt decide so we asked for her suggestions and she chose fried Chicken, and bbq skewers. So flavorful and crunchy! If u go here ask for her and she will help u get satisfied!"}
{"text":"It is not chicken they are famous for, it's Cornish hen. Chicken is bigger than the Cornish hen. Stop advertising chicken in the menu, it is that of Cornish hen. Very dry chicken but crispy skin. The menu shows larger shrimps, but small shrimps on the Pansit. 
Will not go back to dine there again."}
{"text":"Bad service! I was seated by their receptionist. She handed me a menu, then she said your server will be right with you. The place were nearly empty. Maybe 3 tables were filled with 4 person each. The two waiters were just standing around, doing what they do best... NOTHING!!!!  I sat for 10 minutes, no one came to serve me. NEVER AGAIN!!!! I do not recommend to eat here when you visit Las Vegas. Go elsewhere if you are craving for Filipino food."}
{"text":"I walked in with hesitation because of previous awful experience. But as soon as we got situated at the table I noticed that the crew were attebtive and very courteous. I always like the sizzling pork sisig but I was not very pleased with the first order. One of the crew, approached me, sadly I forgot her name, Marion or something, she started asking and offered to do something about it and reall, really.... exerted effort for me to have a satisfying lunch with my family. She made sure that the actual Chef in the kitchen will fix my food and do it better. Even the main Chef, came up to our table and made a little conversation which surprisingly doesnt happen anywhere except when requested. He is a Filipino man dressed up in a white chef uniform with his hat. Very professional and presentable. I always go to the one in Glendale and its a turn off to see the cooks talking so.... loud while you are eating and you can practically recognize how they cook your food by the loudness of their voices. Big no no!!! 

At any rate, I give 5 star to this establishment as they deserve it!!! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Joyce Ellen F's comment. Like you said, soft opening still, from 5:00p.m. to 9:00p.m., of course the door opens at 5:00 and it take about 45 minutes to finish dinner. So, 6:00, 7:00 would be lesser wait. I liked the ambiance and the service. Please give a generous 10% tip, not $1.

Thanks"}
{"text":"Coming from MI I really did want to like this place......  but in my book HORRIBLE!!

Let me cut to the chase...  cause this place isn't really worth it for me..

The lechon & crispy pasta were both really over cooked & dry.  I'm not even going to mention the chicken.

But yeah...  what really destroyed it for me was the horrible, horrible service..  our server seemingly a nice guy..  disappeared for hours at a time..& it wasn't like the guy had 2 tables...  he would just disappear from the floor.?....  

Worst service EVER!!!  

There's so many other good restaurants in Vegas....  please do yourself a favor & skip"}
{"text":"Growing up eating Filipino food & having a mom cook THE BEST Filipino food, I was a little disappointed with this place.

I've been here a couple of times & each experience has been the same.

The food is decent (food is a little dry & bland), ample food options, prices are a bit expensive, service is okay, and the cleanliness could use improvement. 

I've been to the Max's Restaurant in Philippines, and I hope that this location could mimic the taste of the ones back in Philippines."}
{"text":"Filipino food should remain homemade.

I'm not from Las Vegas, but Fresno has Filipino restaurants too. This is the reason I never voluntarily want to eat them. The only places I ever crave are Jollibee and Chow King, but who doesn't like fried chicken and Sio Pao? Also, they're fast food places. 

Max's is a nice place. The place is very clean, and looks very nice. The food on the other hand... See, Filipino food takes a lot of time for preparation, and even then they are usually made in large portions. The food couldn't possibly be made to order, besides the deep fried items though. By how fast the food is served, it is definitely pre-made, reheated, then served. That, or it is made in its simplest form to be rushed. The quality of the food just didn't hit the spot.

We did end up ordering the fried chicken, which I would have enjoyed Jollibee or Chow King over. The Lechon Kawali was good, I think it would have been better if it was fried longer, considering it was very fatty. The beef steak was just not good, in my opinion. The gravy needed some seasoning. It was just so bland. The pancit was flavorless as well. A little salt wouldn't hurt the food.

A lot of Filipinos I've met are really welcoming and nice, I would expect those same kinds of people to be working at a Filipino restaurant. Good customer service should be expected in all places of business. Our waiter seemed to get easily frustrated with having to wait on customers to decide and answering questions. Not one person checked up on us, and our drinks went totally empty. I understand things can get busy, but the place was not full, and if they weren't assisting other people, then why couldn't they at least check up on us or refill our drinks? A little bit of a smile would have been nice too, but I don't want to ask for too much. I'm just a paying customer nbd.

I feel like the point of foreign food places is to take you to that country through their food. I don't think you can get that in Filipino restaurants. At least, not the ones I've been to, including this one.

The food wasn't too bad. The quality didn't stop me from eating, and I did get some water eventually. Like I said earlier, people go to these places to be reminded of their homes in other countries. It's hard to do that if you're not putting everything into your food that makes it possible to do that."}
{"text":"We have a Max's (of Manila) in Hawaii....and I'm assuming this is the same...alas, the first and only time I've had Max's (of any kind) is in the actual Manila many many years ago...so long ago that I don't remember the experience at all...

I had read on Yelp that they had silogs (Filipino breaky with garlic fried rice, fried egg, and your choice of meat) all day.....that most def sealed the deal in having lunch there since we were at Toys R'Us.

We entered when they had just opened at 11/1130am, and it surprisingly had 4 tables already filled. 
I, immediately, asked about their silog selections because I was craving a milkfish silog and our waiter said they \"didn't have that anymore!\" SAD.FACE. I was hella bummed. BF looked at me like I was crazy cuz, as he said it: there's other good food to order! 
Alas, he was right and we ordered the garlic fried rice, pork belly sisig, and he got a lunch special with the fried chicken, garlic rice, and pancit.
 
Being the foodie that he is, he said that the fried chicken here is his favorite! That's a pretty big deal. He loved its moist chicken meat and crispy and NOT AT ALL OILY chicken skin. Not the kind of chicken from KFC or Popeye's for sure.

The garlic fried rice was Guud....the kind of good that reminds me of my mom's garlic fried rice; like homecooking at a restaurant, if that's possible.
The pork belly sisig was very good, especially with some freshly squeezed lime/calamansi juice on it. I just wish it was a little more spicy, like that of Café Moda's sisig ---- although this in no way is comparable to Café Moda's sisig in my mind.

We left happy, full, and even with some leftovers. 
Service was good considering I was expecting a lack there of from reading some Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken of course, taste and look just like the old days way back in the Philippines, the crab fried rice is good and the portion is great I still do have for my lunch at work, the ubod is kind of real cold and get straight from the fridge, although it didn't satisfied me much I will still give 5 stars as to support for the Filipino business in the US. We are from a place here where there is no nice Pnoy food place as big as this one so this serve as a proud Pinoy"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, I thought, man this place isn't as good as the other flip joints I've been too around vegas. I thought it was too commercialized and overrated that it didn't get the quality of the food right. But the second time around, they got it right. The food was amazing and the service was good. I ordered the Lechon kawali and the adobo. Sarap."}
{"text":"Service is slow. With that said, try this restaurant if you are not that hungry, like you just need to eat because you're bored or because it's dinner time, you know, those excuses. 
 
-OR-

Bring a very talkative or entertaining friend.

Food is okay, nothing special."}

Very clean"}
{"text":"I visited my family in Las Vegas and been wanting to try this restaurant because my sister has been raving about it. We usually don't like any Filipino restaurants bc we always think our mom can make it at home way better. I was happy about this restaurant, service was great and fast and most importantly, the food was great (still not comparable to mom's)! We ordered the crab fried rice and it was a simple dish - typical fried rice topped with a crab omelette meant to mixes with rice. We also ordered the sinigang na hipon which is also good but could've been more sour. We also ordered the karekare with bagoong and it's one of my favorite entrees. My two most favorite that we ordered was the pritong bangus and the pork sisig!! The fish was cooked right and it has a citrusy flavor to it and the best best one -- the sisig! It came in a sizzling plate with lemon wedges and it was crunchy in the bottom with right amount of onions and jalapeños, it was so good I'm dreaming about it now. For the dessert, we of course ordered the halo-halo. It was what I expected, toppings, milky shaved ice and the ube ice cream but it was yummy and we finished it too after we are everything else! This is a great meeting place for my family and I; will definitely go back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Oh dear. I ordered a \"whole chicken\".  When i cut it down the middle i think dust shot out of it like in a Crypt keeper movie. Im so sorry. I hate writing bad reviews. But i was very disappointed in the \"famous chicken\". Is it supposed to be dry as a bone and almost disintegrate when you cut it open? maybe it's the Filipino way of cooking im not familiar with? Or maybe the chef  pre-heated this one too many famous times?   I don't think I would go back to this restaurant.  5 stars for the really friendly and nice staff.  But im still giving the food 3 stars. Sorry"}
{"text":"It's the infamous Max franchise! Now finally located in Las Vegas! We just had to go try it. The establishment is very nice and upscale, a lot better than most filipino restaurants, but the food and service was ok. They were out of sisig and kare kare which apparently his the most popular dishes. I was super bummed to find that we couldn't order it since that was all I was looking forward to. Other dishes included chicken adobo, beef steak, and pancit bihon and palabok, and sinigang. 

You can also divide or section off parts of the place if you're looking to celebrate here with a big party which is pretty cool. The service was good, and thy were very attentive and apologetic to us when they were out of certain dishes. However, to be out of not just one dish but two...I feel poses a problem if you're trying to service your customers because they expect to have whatever is on the menu."}
{"text":"I did not try the fried chicken and might come back. The sisig lacked Casa Manila's crunchiness (http://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-manila-north-york). I found it generally unpleasant. The  Pancit Palabok was a better order. We had the appetizer sampler that include calamari and lumpia (little meat filled egg rolls). The lumpia was really tasty. And the calamari batter top notch. I'd probably be back for that. We finished up with some traditional halo halo. No complaints there.

The dining area was a lot smaller than I imagined. Weekend nights this place can be busy. Try to get there before the start of shabbat (sundown Friday), when the Filipinos employed in this area get to knock off for the day and head straight for Max's."}
{"text":"I'm so tempted to bring it down to a two-star review.. However, their chicken is crunchy goodness and finger-lickin' good! 

But this review goes to my waitress, Colette. 
Sweet and accommodating; she made me feel really comfortable when the other items on the \"Max's Platter\" did not. 

So according to the previous sentence, I ordered the the Max's Platter. 

1.  Chicken:  actually more like a 
2. Rice: actually very surprisingly good amount. Some restaurants skimp out on the rice knowing that their Asian audience will order more. But Max's takes care of you with that. 
3. Pancit: salty and mine came out cold. Like that's just gross. 
4. Random orange
5. Random packaged caramel bar. No thanks, I don't want to eat something wrapped in plastic on my plate. 

Okay, so, Colette. 
I told her that my pancit was cold. And she replaced it without hesitation. I guess everyone else is on the sucky side here, and I lucked out! She checked on my food after it was replaced and told me to let her know if it wasn't to my satisfaction. Which it kind of wasn't because it was salty but that's okay I was full anyway. 

So two things. Chicken (with the Jufran) & Colette. 

Have a nice Thursday, reader."}
{"text":"I am half Filipino and absolutely love Filipino food. I am not as talented as my mom though, and cannot cook so I don't often get to eat Filipino foods since she lives 4 hours away.

I was in the area and had to come to Max's.  The pork sinigang was amazing.  Be careful for the chilli though!!  I ate one thinking it was a bean and almost died.  

The place was jam packed on a Friday night.  They need more servers though, because it was quite slow, even before the patrons started filling the place up while we were eating.  For instance when I ate the chilli, my friend had to go up to the counter to get water because the waiter brushed me off.  It was an emergency!  

My friends hadn't tried Filipino food before and really enjoyed the bifstek, beef sinigang, and garlic rice.  The  portions were nice too and we had some to take home. 

I got an order of lumpia shanghai to take home.  Definitely not as good as my mom's but there were tasty.  Much better fresh from the kitchen though."}
{"text":"I was wondering why my tummy ached after I came here with my friends. We were here about a month ago when my friends visited me. They were craving for some filipino food so I recommended that we should go to Max's. After I got home my tummy was aching and I had the s***. Now I know why(shocking).They were in dirty dinning for rodents and dirty equipment(nasty). Although the food was fairly \"good\", the service though on the other hand sucks really bad.  It feels like they don't really care about you and It wasn't even busy that night. It took them like 30 mins just for us to get our refills. I'll never ever go to this place again."}
{"text":"I went there with my family for my birthday. The food was great and was served on time. Their calamansi juice is the best I've had in Vegas so far. The staff was friendly and helpful when my friend needed help picking what to order. And oh, the chicken... very delicious and the meat falls off the bone so easily! And I love that they have lots of garlic in their garlic rice."}
{"text":"The chicken was really delicious. The palabok and Kare-kare was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of the place because for once, there's actually a nice looking Filipino restaurant. 

Came here with family which was a party of 11 so they had to split the tables but informed us ahead of time so that was nice. We were seated within maybe 10 mins of waiting so it wasn't that bad. The menu doesn't have very many options which isn't a bad thing but with that, I was expecting a little better quality in the food and was kin of disappointed. Anyways, the waiter took our orders and the food came out pretty fast. 

First was this egg drop looking soup with bits of corn, carrots and ham(?) or spam? It was an alright soup. I wasn't impressed by it since it looked like something I could have whipped up easily and maybe even better. But it wasn't bad so I'd give it a 3/5. 

Then the main food comes out which was an order of pancit, one whole chicken, kare-kare, and lechon kawali.

Pancit (2/5) - there was a very strong soy sauce flavor yet it wasn't salty. It was really weird but I really didn't like how I could taste this strong cheap soy sauce flavor. And it was also very wet. I'm not used to eating pancit like that and I just didn't think it was great. 

Max's whole chicken (4/5) - nice crispy skin, but the chicken was more on the dry side. I wasn't crazy impressed but I did think it was delicious but for the price I think I like my auntys secret recipe chicken much better. It was good just not good enough for me to come back and want more. 

Kare-kare (2/5) - meh. It was served in a medium bowl and looked like soup with veggies. There was barely any meat and tons of sauce, soup or whatever you wanna call it. Again, this dish didn't really \"wow\" me in any way. I just used that excess sauce to pour on top of my rice. The flavor just wasn't there for me. 

Lechon kawali (3/5) - I understand that this is deep fried but I was really turned off by the amount of oil that was just sitting on the place. And I usually LOVE lechon kawali but man that was some serious grease fest on that plate that I didn't even wanna touch it. I had like two piece but it was just insanely oily. I wish they would have maybe patted it down or something before serving it on the plate. 

The service was really great though. The waiters were fast and constantly checked up on our table. Super friendly. On the other hand, the food wasn't bad but wasn't the best either. I do admit that I enjoyed the chicken the most but I would only come back during family get togethers. I have Filipino pride but Filipino food is just too greasy for me sometimes! :/"}
{"text":"Tuesday Feb 24

Came in with my family 5 adults 15 yrs old and up
And 2 young kids 5 yrs old and 6 yrs old.
We were goin to order a la carte but saw something on the menu good for 10 people party
One was for full set for $159
And the half set 77.00 (note server just assumed never asked if we wanted the full set good for 10 or half set is good for 5..just ASSumed!
The more they charged you the better for them
So food came out and we were amazed how much food came out!!!!was like WOW this is awesome!!
Our bill came and we got charged the full set!!!!WTF why would we order a full set when its good for 10 people, considering the 5 and 6 yrs. old how much they can only eat,common sense half set was what we ordered theres only 7 in our group is 7 is close to a 5 or close to a 10?...smhThey wanted to charged more without giving an option. 
SCAMMER!!! What ASShame"}
{"text":"Great food! I had several dishes that were all good but they have the best lechon kawali I've ever had."}
{"text":"I won't lie the food is great, however finding out Wilben is no longer working here, is a lost for this restaurant. He is one of the best worker here. The work ethichs is incredible. For sure it has something to do with Politics... where can you find a hardworking man that promotes Max's while off the clock at work... He is an asset for this branch.. we will miss him.. and since he is no longer here this won't be our first option to go..."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good service. I went with the Max's fried chicken and crab fried rice. Really liked both dishes. Halo halo for Desert was on point"}
{"text":"Very nice and bright place, well-lit area, very friendly Filipino staff, great selection of Authentic Filipino food.. Their music is great! A lil bit pricey but Good food and worth it esp when you are craving for Fili food!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It feels like home when I eat here. This filipino restaurant serves authentic filipino food that tastes like the one in the Philippines! Their beef steak is amazing. I also love their crispy pata and lechon kawali everytime we visit here. Even though I live an hour away, I'd always take my time to travel just so I can eat dinner in this place. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"always a go-to place for me when we come visit. idk why ppl are giving it such low ratings but we enjoy our visit when we come. service can be hit or miss but overall friendly staff. we ordered plain white rice and garlic rice, fried chicken, lechon kawali?, pork sisig, chop seuy and of course halo halo. i might've missed a couple more entrees bec we literally ordered everything. delicious food and always leaving fully satisfied. def recommend."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but I'll round it up to 4 because they don't deserve an average of 2 and a half stars. I came with 2 others making us a party of 3 on a Friday night. Like everyone said in their reviews the wait is about 45 minutes, which is true. Although the other patrons start complaining about other parties getting called before them and the hosts nicely explain it's based on availability of tables and not the order you come in. C'on people give them a break they just opened, do you expect them to have everything perfect within the first few weeks?! The management team running this place probably have more restaurant experience than you anyway. Jackie was our server and she was pretty good for the most part. We didn't wait too long for our food because I think she had rushed the kitchen since we had asked how much longer it would be before our food was served. We order the chicken sisig, pancit canton and a whole chicken. Shoulda just ordered the chicken like everyone said. Although I did enjoy the pancit canton because they used a different type of noodle. On the other hand, the sisig was just a mess, what's up with the mayo?! It didn't have the vinegar in it like the traditional way. I read in another review it is like flop of mayo called sisig, which is true so I don't recommend ordering this. We had to wait a good 20 minutes to pay because supposedly the credit card machine was acting up, but Jackie was very apologetic about this. I must say her service did make our experience overall better. Lastly, the interior is pretty nice, beautiful for Filipino standards. Next time I need my chicken fix, I'll just order it for take out."}
{"text":"3 of us came here for dinner... wasn't that busy. Was sitting for about 15 min waiting to order when another party came in and sat down. Waited another 5-10 min and the waiter goes to their table and takes their order! Wait... what about us?! I had to tell the waiter what's up,  he was like,  \"oh sorry.\" So wet get our food, the 2 stars is because the food isn't bad, but now our water cups are sitting empty.  I didn't ask cuz I wanted to see if they even noticed. We were practically done eating when he came and filled em up. Not saying you shouldn't eat here... just posting my experience"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE FILIPINO RESTURANT! So delicious. Everything is flavorful. My favorite is their garlic fried rice... I've never had anything like it. Their chicken is juicy crispy. Pancit is also very delicious. A little pricy for filipino food, but the food is defiantly worth it."}
{"text":"11/9/14 was my first time eating here. I've eaten at this restaurant in the Philippine & Hawaii but not in Las Vegas. 

My God sons baptism reception party was here and it was a party of about 100 guest. The set up was nice and very exclusive. 

Food was amazing!!!! Omg I ate so much yummy food. The service was great as well. 

I look forward in coming here for dinner again :)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a few days ago with friends. Our food was very greasy and oily. I did not like the food very much. I tried my friends' food and the only dish I liked was sweet and sour fish. One of my friends got sick from the greasy food. The only good part was our friendly waiter, Nathan. He was very nice."}
{"text":"I don't need to write a wall of text review. All I have to say is; it's decent, pretty pricey for a laughable quality, very slow service even when they're not busy. Since it ain't possible to even rate with no stars, i'll give it a 1 just cause of the Halo Halo presentation. 

PS: Took almost 15 mins to receive our waters."}
{"text":"Customer Service today sucks! 11mins just for someone to notice that I'm sitting here & waiting for so long to think I'm wearing a color blue scrubs. (And to think I'm a patron here too.) Kainis. No good. Oh btw, thanks for the water For 10mins. A server even asked me if the lumpia that we want would be \"fresh\" even if it is called \"fresh lumpia\" oh I guess, it's not one of the good days here @ Max's. But still, today... It's a 1 star."}
{"text":"First time here at this location here in Las Vegas. Place is clean and food is sub-par good. Our server was responsive and provided my family with everything we needed. Not too many filipino restraunts around but this place is the better one amongst the rest."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  As a vegetarian who is allergic to shellfish I was concerned when I saw the menu had a great deal of shellfish.  The server recommended the asparagus and tofu dish and it was delicious.  If you like garlic, I suggest the jasmine rice...super yummy!  Also, they have the best sweet potato fries...they add a dash of cinnamon!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family and have experienced the worst filipino food experience. First off, they have the most inefficient service. We had to wait 20 mins although they had 4 tables available to be seated. The reason being is their slow bus boys. They use a flat tray which cannot load as much dishes in and the guy goes back and forth to the end of the restaurant to get the rag. This is a sign already of horrible management. After we were seated, I had told our waiter of the 30 for $15 offer I bought from yelp. He acknowledged and asked me to mention at the end. We ordered whole chicken, garlic rice, kare kare, palabok, halo halo and I redeemed their check in gift for a ube decadence that I asked from the waiter. More slow service. Our order didn't come for quite some time and when it came, the food was mediocre. The chicken was dry, the kare kare and palabok was bland. Even the halo halo was mediocre. Furthermore, the portions were very little. I was very disappointed. It definitely was not comparable to other filipino places I have eaten. Casa Manila and Sampaguita by far were more superior in taste, quality and portion.

To make things worst, I go to the cashier to pay and I was charged with the check in offer (4.99 for ube decadence). The reason they said was because I already used the 30 for 15 offer they had. I had told them the waiter accepted the order and didn't let us know I couldn't use both. We didn't need to order the ube decadence. We ordered it to try it out which I thought was the purpose of the offer. The cashier was not willing to take it and no manager was around to assist (not surprised). Since it was not significant, I decided to let it go. As a filipino myself, I would no longer recommend this place. Unless you want horrible service, STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"5 stars to even out the overall rating on here.  It's definitely a 4 star place.

I'm a Filipino food snob. So is my Mom.  We go to Filipino restaurants all over the world and judge.  Mom is Malabon, where they cook very well.  

Max's is a nice and clean place.  Looks like you stepped into a Wendy's or a Fridays, which is impressive for a Filipino restaurant.

Max's in the Philippines isn't that great, because ingredient quality in the PI is terrible.  Here in America, the food is well-prepared and flavorful.  We got there aright at opening, so no issues with speed, but I can see how things can slow down if the place has multiple tables in play.  

We had the lumpia ubod, whole chicken, kare kare, crispy pata, and bulalo.  All of it was good.  We even wrapped everything and flew back home to the midwest with it.

All things considered, this is a good place for Filipino food.  You should try it."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever!!!

As soon as we walked in, we instantly felt the love. Every single employee we came across greeted us with enthusiasm. We were sat immediately, and our orders were taken promptly. The restaurant was very clean and the ambiance, being seated by the fireplace, was perfect. 

There were 3 of us, and since we came for the famous fried chicken, we ordered a whole chicken and garlic fried rice. The whole meal was less than $25, and we had left overs.

Fried chicken: absolutely one of the most delicious Fried chicken out there! Their fried chicken is on breaded, but it is packed with flavor. 

Garlic fried rice is life!!! If you like garlic, then this is your alley, boo. Try it and sing your hallelujahs! 

Fried chicken came with fries ... the fries, we aren't too excited about. But hey, it's all good.

All in all, I highly recommend. 

Great food with an even greater customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Here right now. Sitting for about an hour at the table and don't even have drinks yet. Not even water. Never again."}
{"text":"Finally!! This has been a bookmark for quite some time months before their opening.  In fact, Yelp Las Vegas even has a Talk Thread about Max's Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/topic/north-las-vegas-halo-halo-and-maxs).  What's all the hype...it's suppose to be Filipino food at its finest.  I've had their popular crispy chicken before.  And what I can remember, it was crunchy, greasy, and yet, it was still tasty.  Fast forward to now, the chicken is still greasy, still crunchy, and still tasty.  

My Thoughts:
-The Restaurant:  I know it's a new Restaurant and is suppose to be clean.  Guess what? It was was.  I was actually impressed with the size, decor, spaciousness, and cleanliness.  I don't remember a Max's being this clean.  Max's of Manila in Las Vegas is a change

-Ambiance:  Comfortable, for me at least.  I would say it was 99.2% Filipino.  Make that 99.9% after Terri R and I arrived. It's their soft opening, so busy they were.  The mood was fast paced once you finally get your food.  As soon as you leave, they fill your vacant tables.  Lines, lines, and more lines.  Customer were coming from all over.  You even notice this from the parking lot with all the NV plates, CA plates, and rental cars. The wait for us was suppose to be 40 minutes, but we ended up being seated just 15 minutes later.  NOTE:  This can still seem like an eternity if you're hungry like a madman. 

-Service:  Not at their finest.  Once seated, we waited patiently, then impatiently for a long 15 minutes.  Keep in mind, this is just to get our orders taken and your drinks filled.  Max's is Filipino and their service is definitely on \"Filipino Time\".  

-The Food (Max's Budget):  Like I stated earlier, their chicken hasn't changed over the years.  I ended up with their Max's Budget, which consisted of a leg quarter of Max's full chicken, 3 baby pieces of Shanghai Lumpia, a cup of white rice, and Caramel Bar.  The chicken had a lot of meat and was tasty.  The chicken was also greasy.  I use to be a fan of this type of chicken.  Not anymore.  But I can't complain about it because this is how they set for their fried chicken to taste like.  My mom's fried chicken is even made this way.  Geez, my family parties even have chicken made this way.  In other words...comfort \"Food for You\".  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=k0PIF3xHTbBa16EtRCe3yg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)

-The Food (Max's Teaser):  I also ordered the Max's Teaser, which is their Calamari, Fries, and Shanghai Lumpia.  I don't eat fried foods much anymore and only got this to taste test.  I was disappointed with this order because it was skimped to the Max (pun intended). I felt disgusted after killing the whole plate.  Yes, I had to deMELish this but it didn't take much because I didn't get much.  I don't want to sound \"kuripot\" and I get it...it's called Max's Teaser for a reason.  They just teased me and ganked me with baby portions. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qm-sSyuKcJ-aYusyMZqMnQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)

-Price:  I'm mixed here because Terri's Kare Kare looked hooked up, my main meal's portion was average, and the Teaser was lacking everything.  But if you need to know, dinner for two with an appetizer only cost $33.  I guess that's not bad at all.

Overall, it would take a little more for me to give this place 5 stars because they are not \"As good as it gets\".  It's also tough for me to give them less then 4 stars because Max's Las Vegas is how I remember them and exactly what they aim to be...that's comfort Filipino food and served at a \"Filipino Time\" pace.  I'm sure I will be back because my out-of-town friends and family are fans. I'm sure they'll want to come here when they visit. 


PS:  I thought the artwork on their paper place mats were a little interesting. These are just some of the things you notice when you're waiting to be served. 



YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (465/500)"}
{"text":"Went here last night for a family dinner. Food is always great in Max's. And our server Nathan went above and beyond his duties helping us with all we need."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review...

I came here with a bunch of other Filipino friends for a get-together and the service and food were amazing! We were a group of 12-14 and they were more than happy to accommodate our group with no problem. We did call ahead and reserved some tables as they said it can get pretty busy during the dinner hours. When we got there, our tables were ready and we were able to be seated immediately. 

Our waiter and waitresses were very pleasant and accommodating. They came around and took drink orders while we all took a look at the menu. Most of us decided to order a dish or two and share like family style and just split the bill. Great idea as there were so many items on the menu that we all wanted to try and this gave us the perfect opportunity to get everything we wanted. Drinks were brought out quickly and our orders were placed. Since there were many of us and lots of food ordered, we did have to wait longer than we normally would if we came alone, but it wasn't a problem since it gave us all time to talk and catch up. 

Our group ordered Lumpiang Shanghai, Calamari, Garlic Rice, Steamed Rice, Pancit Bihon, Chopsuey, Lechon Kawali, Chicken Adobo, Kare-Kare, and Chicken Sisig. Everything came out hot and sizzling. The smell was divine and the taste was even better. In my opinion, Max's offers some of the best Filipino food that I've tasted outside of cooking it myself. 

From start to finish, our wait staff was very helpful and pleasant toward us. They came around often to check on us and to fill our drinks. Would definitely come back here again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Growing up eating Filipino food pretty much every day of my life, I knew I had to come visit this location at least once, just to see if they could do Filipino food just as good as my momma! 

This is a pretty busy location, with a Sushi 168 AYCE and a Value Village occupying the same plaza. However, there's a decent amount of parking, which is always a plus. We visited on a Sunday afternoon around 1:00 PM. It was super busy, but service wasn't as slow as I expected, which is another plus. We ordered: the infamous Max's fried chicken, the crispy pata (deep fried pork knuckles), the pancit palabok (noodles), and three servings of the buko pandan (a milky drink with gelatin cubes). The chicken and the crispy pata were fine although a bit on the dry side. The palabok, on the other hand, was very bland and lacked the flavour I'm used to. The buko pandan was also pretty average, although the gelatin still tasted a bit frozen, if I recall correctly. Overall, the food was average (although a bit overpriced) - if we're in the area again, we would consider coming back, but it isn't a spot I'd go out of my way to visit again.

For three people, with tax, and tip, our total came to around $58.00."}
{"text":"It was great to have lunch at the very 1st Max of Manila - a Filipino brand name restaurant - now in Toronto. The service is truly Pinoy with young Filipino smiling faces willing to serve you and to please you with that ever famous Filipino hospitality, politeness and respect. The owner was very nice and likeable and was saying hello to every table. The ambiance was great. NIce booth tables and everything done well. Last but not the least, the food tasted like Max Manila with the Jufran and Lea Perrins Worcestershire Sauce and Tabasco on the side. The Halo- Halo and Buko Pandan - courtesy of Mr. P- was just a perfect end to our lunch. Thanks Pidoy and Ting. We'll be back with my team and the rest of the family."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service,Just like I'm at home, miss you Philippines. The best chicken, Bulalo and  halo halo"}
{"text":"Las Vegas definitely needed a Max's restaurant and we finally got one. All of the food was cooked to perfection.  Sinigang, Pancit, Kare-Kare...etc.  I definitely recommend you dine at Max's!"}
{"text":"Food Is typical Max's. Some dishes are great while others are just okay. Staff Is always friendly. Establishment Is clean."}
{"text":"Got here about twenty minutes ago.  No sign in sheet.  Poor hostess had no idea what seating arrangement to use because there wasn't one.  Took ten minutes for the manager to come figure things out.  Signed up for seating.  Waited another 15 minutes and finally seated.  11 tables seated, 7 not.  Should note this has never happened before.  Will report back on the food.  

Here it is, five months later.  Wife is currently there.  Waited twenty minutes with only another party waiting.  Seated and then given water with no ice....even though calimansi was ordered.  Then they clean the table next to them and they startled the wife because they were slamming dishes hard on the tray.  Wife said it is going to be awhile before we go there again.  Max, raise your standards with your staff.  Food is delicious, but your staff needs training in customer service."}
{"text":"Slowwwwwwww service!!!!!!! Asked for water with lemon and had to ask 3 waiters for the lemon"}
{"text":"My husband and me like this restaurant a lot. Always make us have good appetite. Yummy."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 for the horrible service if I could. Food aside, an incident took place today where one of my parents friend slipped on the floor due to the negligence of the restaurant. Mind you he was a 70 yr old man. He had slipped on some noodles (pancit). Right away we asked for the manager instead we got Von, the supervisor. Right away he was not professional about the situation and did not know what to do. He just asked for the identification card of our friend that had fallen, gave ice and towels and just went back to waiting tables. No incident report!? What kind of establishment is this!? To add salt to the wound only two halo halo desserts were comp and not the whole meal!!! C'mon now, that's just ridiculous!!! Our friend had to go to urgent care and we had to go back to this restaurant to confirm that our friend was not going to be billed by the hospital and it was the restaurant fully liable. We had to talk to the manager and to make a long story short at this point we waited over an hour and half. It was very frustrating to have some kind of copy stating the restaurant was liable for this accident. The manager kept insisting that everything is done verbal per company policy. Our friend is okay to say at least. This restaurant has been a nightmare to deal with!!!"}
{"text":"Took our Filipino nanny here for her birthday.  Food was ok.  Flavours are best described as a fusion of Thai and Chinese.  Lots of sauces for different dishes (anchovies based paste for beef peanut stew,  liver sauce for deep fried pork belly chunks and banana sauce for fried chicken).  Loved dessert on what I can describe as the Filipino creme brûlée.  Chicken was pretty good.  Was seasoned well enough without having to rely on any heavy batter.  Service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Warning: this is a bad review and I don't intend to pull any punches. I was visiting Vegas over Memorial Day weekend and searched for Filipino restaurants in town without ready made food on steam tables. Options were limited and it seems many places have closed down so Max's is one of the only local options available to Filipinos in the area. This lack of local competition really shows in the operation and upkeep of this restaurant. I am from Southern California and I know what it looks like when Filipino restaurants have their shit together and when other ones just operate on good intentions and wishful thinking. I have also have eaten at Max's in the Philippines and in California. I chose to eat at this location because I was hoping for the reliability and consistency one can and should expect from an international chain. Frankly, this site was disappointing to say the least and I think it's a real letdown for the local Filipino community who have such few options. Take some pride in your work as local representatives of your culture! First of all, clean up the mess on the ramp outside. There was garbage on the railing outside -cartons and even beer cans. The rest of the neighborhood may look like it's gone to shit, but your place shouldn't reflect that. Secondly, there is no clear managerial hierarchy there (that the employees fear/respect). We were seated and clearly wanted to order, but no one came. Someone eventually stepped up as if he were the manager, but I also noticed that he was spread thin doing menial tasks others should be doing. Meanwhile there are just too many people hanging around, hands empty with nothing to do. As a manager, that is a red flag that means some people need to get fired to make room for the hard working staff to collect the tips they deserve. While we were waiting around 6PM for some serious attention, I noticed a gathering of four male staff enjoying each other's company and wrapping silverware in napkins. What does that say about time management and task assignment if four guys are sitting around, chatting, and wrapping napkins during the dinner rush? That is a one man job to be done before lunchtime or between lunch and dinner. \"Manager\" guy says their shifts are already over. What does that say that they're hanging about \"after work\"? There were also three staff chilling out at the front desk. Too much congregating and fraternizing. Meanwhile, you have my famished wife and diabetic father waiting to order, but the place settings weren't even on the table before we were seated. The guy that we thought was our waiter was bussing the table next to us. The table next to us was clearly annoyed because they wanted to leave after their meal, but couldn't. However, the bill holder for their table somehow on our table. Honestly, in my opinion observing the social dynamic, the restaurant needs to hire some competent female staff on the floor that will intimidate the male staff into not wanting to look inadequate. I'm no feminist, but I'm also familiar with how things fall apart when you've got a boy's club that doesn't see the need to take work seriously. You'll achieve better efficiency when people are assigned specific tasks they are solely responsible for instead of this communal accountability so very few restaurants can pull off. Your local pinoys are hardworking people and they deserve good service! BTW, everyone at our table agreed that the sinigang was too sour."}
{"text":"This is the fist time I'm doing a review. I love Max's food, but the service is HELLA SLOW! We seated @ 8:10pm, the server took our orders and drinks.. and after 55 minutes of waiting (almost 1 hour) no drinks and no food.. So if you guys are fan of waiting forever and Extremely SLOW SERVICE, Then Max's is the place to be."}
{"text":"This place was reccomend by a family friend and since it's fairly close to church my family and I decided to check it out for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The place was fairly packed at about 1pm, but we were able to be seated at a table for 6 and service was quite quick as well! Everything was rather enjoyable and tasty except for their famous chicken which we all found to be rather bland and dry. The palabok, kare kare, pork adobo, asparagus and tofu, milkfish, adobo fried rice and garlic rice were all rather tasty but for the price, we found the portions leaning towards the smaller side."}
{"text":"When you are craving some good Filipino food in a slightly upscale setting definitely go here. I enjoyed Maxs while in the Philippines and this one is just as good in a very nice setting. You can't go wrong with the chicken adobo, garlic rice, fried chicken, pancit or lechon kawali. All are very tasty and served in perfect portions for sharing. The staff is very friendly and warm which isn't surprising since great hospitality is common with most Filipino businesses."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit here after their soft opening, so essentially this was a second chance. 

Pros (very few)

-Courteous staff, very apologetic for their inadequate supply of favorite menu items. i.e. Lechon Kawali, Pork Sisig & Calamansi.

-Clean dining and bar area. Most likely cause they just opened. (We'll see how long that'll last)

Cons

-Servers are not competent of their job description and are forgetful of serving basics. i.e. Always get the drink orders first before taking food orders or any food has come out, not informing patrons of items that are currently unavailable, forgetting to bring the dessert portion of the meal (which is included when ordering one of the combo meals)

-Restaurant was only half full, yet the waiting area in the front was nearly packed and the wait was 10 mins on what appears to be a slow night. 

With that said, this may be a new restaurant in the area, but this is a popular and successful chain in the Philippines and California.  So they have no excuse for any short comings or inexperience with opening up this new location. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING!!! Beware!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. Food was amazing!  Service was good!! Family dinner for a part of 15 they tended to us well and can't say enough about the food! Milk fish was delicious and the pork bbq was on point!! About a ten min drive from the strip. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Another great Filipino restaurant in Vegas!

We live in San Diego, and we did not know a Max's had opened up in LV. We typically go to the one in Glendale which already has a good reputation. We were thrilled to find this one in Vegas. 

Even with all the five-star restaurants and sumptuous buffets we had in Vegas, it was also mandatory for us to squeeze in a trip to Max's.

We had their famous fried chicken, miki bihon, lumpia shangai, tinola soup and calamansi juice. What a treat! It was a pleasant change from all of the food offerings on the Strip. Great service too.

Now if only Max's could re-open a branch in San Diego..."}
{"text":"A very cozy and clean restaurant with super friendly service and delicious home style Filipino food. It's a full service restaurant, so the prices are not obviously as low as a take-out only resto, but still reasonable. A large variety of dishes to choose from, including my favs, sinagang and kare-kare. My dining partner and I both had the quarter chicken with garlic rice. The skin was really crispy and the chicken was juicy inside. Garlic rice was flavourful and a fair portion. We had the Ube creme decadence for dessert...sooo good, I wanted to order another one! 

My only suggestion would be to lower the volume of the music. I felt like I had to really raise my voice in order to be heard. Other than that, I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Busy night but service was quick and waiters were friendly. Great for large groups! Loved the ube ice cream!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant and I must say it feels like I'm back in the Philippines again.  I read some reviews here on Yelp about this restaurant.   And some of these reviews aren't even true.  Just a bunch of haters who doesn't appreciate good quality filipino foods.  People say that this restaurant has small portions of food for a big price.   Not exactly.   I see normal size food for a reasonable price.   I got the combo with everything.  Rice, fresh lumpia, and crispy fried half chicken which the chicken is big not small as people suggested.  The chicken is extra crispy.   I can hear the crunch every time I took a bite. I was completely happy and full.  I also love there desserts.   I got the Halo-Halo ice cream which was really big and filling.  So if you want traditional filipino food, come to this restaurant.   They will treat you like your back home in the Philippines."}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas from San Diego and I was happy to find Max's Restaurant because it eases the homesickness a tad. The Max's in SD closed years ago so seeing it thriving here is definitely a treat. 

Since I arrived here in December I have visited this place about 5 times already. I have dined in as well as phoned in pick up orders. Through my  experiences, I didn't realize that this restaurant was fairly new nor did I have any qualms about the service I received nor the quality of my food. In fact, during my last trip here, our server Lloyd was very amicable, polite, and sincere. I almost felt ashamed to hear an elder regard me with \"Po\" so obviously I tried to be an even more pleasant customer.

The nice thing is that a lot of the food here seems to be cook to order. For anyone who knows a little about cooking Filipino food, it doesn't take 5 minutes to tenderize your meat, deep fry your chicken, or soften your pancit. While I'm sure more kinks could be worked out in terms of speed, I'd much rather enjoy my food piping hot and fresh (with a 15-20 wait) than something that could easily be obtained from a \"turo-turo\" with a layer of soluble fat skimming the top.

Also, we brought some food to my family while they were visiting. Everyone knows that a homecooking 83 year old grandmother is the harshest critic of Filipino food. Needless to say, my nanay enjoyed her food very much and was surprised at the quality of the sisig and pancit. To each their own.. 

Anyhow, it might not quite be like home but for a family who is too lazy to cook, a transplant who wants a little taste of home, or a tourist/newcomer looking to try a different sort of Asian flare, I definitely recommend Max's. 

Try their garlic fried rice, fried chicken, lechon sisig, and pancit miki if you want to be a little on the safe side. Also, their calamansi juice is very refreshing. 

They've been around since 1945.. they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I agree on most reviews... The wait is horrible.
Last time I came down for dinner I waited 2 hours and gave up...

I went down for lunch it was quick but their debit machine is out of service... If I want to eat I have to go to at machine.... so I end up eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! OVerrated, took FOREVER to get seated, get our drinks, order, & the actual food.  Better off going to a Turo-Turo joint"}
{"text":"I do a lot of marketing in the area so when I saw this restaurant, I got excited as it was one of our favorite filipino restaurant when we lived in San Diege. So I decided to have lunch there that day. The team members were very polite with their hello ma'am, yes ma'am, etc. The place was clean, bright and big, unlike most filipino restaurants, where you stand in line and point out what item you would like. Max's had a menu you can choose from.  Since I was by myself, I waited for quite sometimes (maybe 10-15 mins) until someone finally came and asked if I've been helped??? What????? I tried to get their attention so that I can order something to drink at least since I was parched, but I seemed to be invisible to them. Anyways, the lady immediately took my drink order and said she will be back to take my order, I stopped her and told her what my order was, as I did not want to wait again just for them to take my order. I am on my lunch break afterall. At this time, I only had 45 mins left of it.  My drink was delivered to my table immediately followed by my order there after.  The fried chicken was really delicious, just as I remembered it. Then my bill was handed to me. Sticker-shocked!!! For a sago drink and lunch special with tax cost me nearly $21. What the heck, were there gold speckles on the chicken?? LOL."}
{"text":"The place is big and clean. The waiters were very courteous and attentive.The food was very good!I love this place and the best Max's in US that I've been so far. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Do not get the chicken soup and the set menu!  My family dined here New Years Day. Don't know why of all the nice restaurants in Vegas, we picked Max. 
Anyway, we decided on the set menu A and 3 orders of the fresh lumpia. It also comes with soda. There were 9 of us dining. Here my review of the set menu items:

All items were brought one at a time and slow. We finished each dish before the others came out. 
Chicken Soup - The most disgusting, salty, no flavor soup. Seems like they threw canned stuff in a pot and canned broth. Nasty!  How this even passed as part of the menu is beyond reason. Manager! I'm calling you out! Please taste this nasty soup. I would not feed this to my dogs!

Fresh Lumpia - Veggies were cold. As in they took it out if the fridge and poured the sauce over it. 
Fried lumpiang Shanghai - could not taste the meat
Garlic Fried Rice - Too mooshy. This is supposed to be dry. Hello Fried Rice!
Bistek -  Taste was ok but they used too much corn starch to thicken the sauce. Beef is low grade with too much cartilage
Bihon Pancit - lacked the veggies and meat. This too was wet noodles. Not supposed to be wet
Chicken - this is the only dish we enjoyed. But we were already full. 
Calamsi Juice - Artificial Taste concentrated nasty!
Buko Juice - worst than Zico coconut juice coconut meat was nasty


Overall
I would not dine here ever again unless I was dying for some fried chicken.  If I do I'll take it to go. But then my wife can make the same chicken. She just buys the Costco rotisserie chicken cuts it up and fries it. Better than Max. 

Never again!

I was not going to give it a star but it would not let me go forward."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced for Filipino food. It wasn't even great, it was just typical Filipino dishes. I've tasted way better ones elsewhere. We ordered spring rolls and they came out burnt (the ends were literally black). We asked if this could replaced with well cooked ones but the waitress said that's normal. I'm pretty sure anyone...even if they're not familiar with spring rolls.. would recognize it as burnt. They refused to change it so we just sliced off the charcoal ourselves. Their chicken was a bit dry. The vegetable dish was bland. However, the only food I truly enjoyed here was their halo halo. I would give their halo halo 4/5. Other than that it's a 1 for food and the slow service."}
{"text":"I'm experience with Filipino cuisine is quite limited. I've always summarized Filipino food as a saltier and oilier version of Chinese food but my experience at Max's has changed my mind. 

We ordered 4 dishes to share among 3 people (we even had some leftovers). We got Laing which was our veggie dish. It was supposed to be spicy but I thought it was very mild. My friend that couldn't handle any spice didn't try any more of it after one bite. If you're incredibly sensitive to spice, I wouldn't recommend this dish. It's hard to describe this dish because I've never had anything quite like it. With that being said, it wasn't a bad dish but it didn't make it to our any of our favourites list.

We also got pancit. The noodles they use were like Chinese yi mein or e-fu mein. It honestly tasted like a Chinese dish. I liked it and there were several pieces of big shrimps in there. This is a good dish to get if you're in the mood for noodles.

Next, we had the beef karekare. It again, tasted very similar to Chinese food. This was a solid dish and I would order it again.

Next is one of my favourite dishes - fish sisig. It's basically sizzling plate with chopped up meat of your choice. I think I really like this dish because it was the least reminiscent of any Chinese dish. I think this is a must try if you come to this restaurant.

Now, on to my favourite part of the meal...dessert! There's a Yelp check in offer for an ube creme decadence. I really like ube (purple yam) desserts. My friends also got a dessert which was some sort of ice cream with minty jello like toppings. Make sure you do the check in for hte ube creme because it was so delicious and best of it, it's free!"}
{"text":"Took my parents for their wedding anniversary! 52 years ago, they celebrated their wedding reception at Max's restaurant roses ave. dinner per person was only 2.50 pesos."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Max's Restaurant, but never had a chance to visit it, till today.  I wasn't too fond of the location, mostly because my GPS took me somewhere else! I would recommend keeping an eye out for it, if your using google maps, the restaurant is located across the street from dispensary, and next to a car wash. The restaurant is located near a bunch of stores, even Target.  Now onto to the food, upon my arrival I saw the story of how Max was born, the famous fried chicken. Naturally I had to order it to try it out. I also saw a few bowl specials. Some of them were $10 and $5
Not bad!  I decided to try out the fried rice with salted eggs, and the crispy pata.
I pretty much enjoy Filipino food and Max's restaurant knows how to step it up, the food was delicious. I loved the salted egg fried rice, it was the best the flavors and the eggs really nailed it. I also thought the crispy pata was cooked perfectly and had a good crunch with flavor- it paired nicely with the salted egg fried rice.  I can't wait to come back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars... The food was okay. The server (James) was always nowhere to be found. Very rude and not very attentive... He has no personality whatsoever. He should not be a server! Never coming back here ever!!! What a disappointment.ugh"}
{"text":"First time to this location. Excellent service from Kirt! All the food we ordered was absolutely delicious! We had lumpia Shanghai, dinuguan, a whole fried chicken, crispy pata, and garlic rice! The food all came out in a timely manner, all generous portions, and worth the visit! Will take the time to come back the next time we are back in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times and I've always found the food decent. The dishes remind me of the Philippines, and I like that their portions are reasonable unlike some upscale Filipino restaurants. Their prices are not cheap but not too expensive. Their crispy pata, pork adobo, and chicken adobo are good. The pancit canton was average -- sometimes you got more noodles, sometimes less. The halo halo was okay, but nothing special. The service was good but I did find that every time I visited they would always forget to serve a dish and we'd have to remind them. It would come later and that was annoying because we had already finished half of our meal. Overall I'd recommend the place because it's a decent Filipino place, but it's nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Back in the days, 40 years back, if you are craving for some delicious fried chicken, the only restaurant you have in mind is Max's, the one at Dewey is the one Is the one I nostalgically remember.  High majority of diners are feasting on that delicious fried chicken.
Fast forward, nothing last forever, we evolve. Now, their is a menu, offering versions of the original dish, the key factor now is, who is in charge of the Kitchen, the Chef.
Here, at this particular Max's, Chef Cristobal has the goods, hands done.
BTW, I have not tried their fried chicken, maybe next LV visit."}
{"text":"Great food!  We enjoyed the fried chicken, lumpia Shanghai, kids fried chicken & spaghetti.  The seating & service was slow but we loved it!"}
{"text":"1.5/5

*The service here was a bit lackluster in terms of speed and just trying to get them to notice you. 

-Lumpiang Ubod - $12.99
I didn't like this dish at all. It was like eating a crepe filled with raw vegetables and meat. There was no flavor and the peanut dip was somehow really sweet, and didn't go well with the savoury meat at all.

-Lechon Kawali Sisig - $14.99
the sisig here was crunchy and every bites was explosion of flavors. It also has a texture contrast of soft pieces as well as crispy since the dish was served on a hot cast iron plate. Toward the end the sisig became quite greasy and it would have been better if there was something tangy like lemon to cut through the fat.

-Lechon Kawali  - $15.99
The skin was super crispy while the inside was dry and hard to bite. It also lacked seasonings but the mild tartness of the liver sauce helped to cut through the \"supposed to be\" fattiness of the lechon kawali.

-Pancit Palabok - $10.99
There was something strange about the texture of the rice noodle and the sauce that didn't work for me at all. The noodle was overcooked, mushy and sauce was really .. flour-y? I also found the noodle to be quite bland and the cracklings were incredibly dry, it just added no flavors to the palabok at all.

-Garlic Rice - $6.95
The garlic rice was a must order when you are having Filipino food and we also had a lot of saucy dishes as well. It was very garlicky with real bits of garlic, but in a good way.

-Leche Flan - $3.99
Nothing special. Tasted just like any other flan that I could make at home.

-Ube Creme Decadence - $4.99
Technically we received this dish for free as there was a check-in special on Yelp that day. On the initial bites, the texture was similar to a panna cotta, rich and creamy yet light in flavor. When you dig in further, you will find the rich ube creme in center. The milk and cream muted the starch of the ube to make a perfect pair, finished off by the ube roll crumbs. I thought it was a light and refreshing dessert to cleanse the palate all that oiliness from the lunch :)."}
{"text":"Fist time here and the food was so good! The lumpia was great! We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I went today with my wife and after my previous 3 star  review I have to say things are much improved.  We were seated quickly and the staff was very friendly (well dressed also).  I had Pancit Canton which was okay but not amazing since it was a bit soggy. However, the nilagang baka (beef soup) with extra side of rice was very delicious.  Also,  the sago't gulaman drink and halo-halo dessert were perfect. This time around our table was quickly cleared of any empty dishes.  I definitely look forward to coming back if not just for the Halo-Halo :)"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for some fish, soup, or other Philippine favorites. The lumpia is is okay. The milkfish is excellent. The crispy pats is almost spot on!"}
{"text":"Ate here with the family tonight. 

We ordered A LOT of food. 
- pancit palabok
- crispy pata
- spicy Laing tilapia
- half chicken 
- garlic rice 
I wasn't too crazy about any of it. We have a lot of leftovers and there were 4 of us. I also ordered buko pandan and that was probably my favorite. 

Our server wasn't that great either. He didn't really come to our table to see how we were doing and the one time he did, I asked for a water and never got it. I had to ask another server because he never came back to our table."}
{"text":"Tried this place after finding it on Yelp. The staff is friendly it's and about 7 minutes from the strip . The food was great can't recall what I ordered since my gf did all the ordering. They have one of my favorite beers\" Red Horse\". The food prices weren't over priced, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I finally was able to visit Max's. My visit wasn't at all bad- I read all the reviews prior to going, so I was very prepared for the non attentive service by our waitress. Took forever to order, food took a bit to arrive, didn't check on us once, and had to ask for refills as well as our check. Good thing I was with family, we were able to visit. 
Now as for the food, I ordered the basics, (5 of us) pancit canton, pork adobo, bistek, lechon, 1/2 fried chicken, and of course the large bowl of rice! Everything was delicious. I ate so much that I still can't breathe.
As long as you don't expect great service, the food won't be disappointing, taste just like home.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Filipino restaurants. It is a very nice and clean restaurant which makes the dining experience that much better. The dating bangus, spring chicken, shrimp sinigang and halo halo or my favorites!"}
{"text":"First time here for dinner and we actually came back the next day for breakfast with friends. 

Customer service was great."}
{"text":"I will begin by saying that I am Filipino.  And this is my first time in Las Vegas and at a Max's.  I was very excited to try it out when I looked at the menu.  

My party of three got there and were promptly seated.  We ordered our food and that was literally the last time we saw our waitress until the end, which I'll get more into later.  We are eating and don't get me wrong, the food is good.   We also ordered three buko juices and three waters.  Funny, the buko juice comes out, but not the water.  No big deal right?  Our waitress will come out and bring it.  It's only water.  However, out waitress does not come to check on us. There are no other wait staff in sight.  So I go the hostess and explain that we were waiting on our waters because we finished the buko juices and were thirsty.  The hostess then goes to the back and 10 minutes later says she informed our waitress.  She doesn't do the reasonable thing and bring the waters herself.  OK...fine.  10 minutes pass and I begin to wonder if they're cooking the water.  another 5 minutes and another waiter brings us 2 waters.  We kindly explain there are three of us, and so he brings us another water, but this time, only took 3 minutes (yes, I began timing a while ago).  

At this point, we are all pretty upset.  Another 10 minutes of us not eating go by and we are wondering if our check will be delivered.  Another 10 minutes goes by, all the while, the hostess, to whom we sat a mere tablelength away, does nothing.  So I strand and ask her for the check.  She hurries to the waiter and he sees me standing, coat on, ready to go, and asks if we want dessert.  Inside, my blood boils, outside, my face contorts and I ever so restraintfully say \"just the check.\"  Mind you, there is a family behind us celebrating a kid's birthday, so I am not about to go and ruin their evening because wait staff is not good at the only thing they are hired to do...wait.  

My two companions go to the car because they are so upset and I, standing at the hostess' table, trying to pay the bill, explain our frustration.  The waitress, who earlier disappeared,must've seen our table was empty and came back out to the hostess' table and sees me and says in Tagalog that she's got something to do in the kitchen and runs back once she sees me.  The only thing the hostess can say is that they only had one server that night and she's sorry.   

Though the food was very good, the staff and service are terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  So much so that I refuse to go to another Max's again and will inform all my friends and family of this experience.  Also, I will be calling the manager tomorrow to explain to him/her our experience.  

If I could rate lower, I would."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception at Max's with 80 guests. From the moment we reserved up until the end of the reception, the staff didn't fail. They always call for updates specially when the day was approaching to make sure that it'll go well. We love the service, the food and all other guests enjoyed. 'Til next time Max's. More power and God bless"}
{"text":"This place was LEGIT. Started off with the Max's Teaser, which included sweet potato fries, Lumpiang Shanghai egg rolls, and Calamares. All were awesome. Tried the Sago't Gulaman drink which was amazing. I couldn't decide between the Max's Platter that featured their famous chicken or the Pancit Canton, but I had the need for shrimp so I got the Pancit Canton (egg noodles). Amazing and destroyed it. We also got the Pinatuyong Pork Adobo - so good. My only complaint was the exceeding slow service, but the food was on point. Totally going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers a wide range variety of Filipino cuisines. There are a lot of appetizers, entrees, soups, desserts and drinks to choose from.

The interior of this building is beautifully designed. Seems clean but when we were seated, I wish they sweep the floor. There was a couple grains of rice and pieces of food under the table which was unacceptable. A couple of our chairs on our table were ripped...

Service was very poor. It took awhile for someone just to take our order for drinks and to bring them out. It took forever again to come back and take our order for food.

Estimated about 45 minutes to an hour for our food to finally arrive to our table. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was very satisfying. We started with a sampler which had calamari, sweet potatoe fries and egg rolls. Main course not sure what my family ordered but had 2 bowls of fish soup, of course the full size max chicken and sigsig.

Our server was nowhere to be found the majority of the time. We really needed our drinks to be refilled and every time we asked someone to get our refills they all said \"ok\" but none of them actually came back. We finally got the attention of our server to finally refill our drinks.

I wish they took away the plates that were done so we had more room or didn't have to stare at an empty dish the whole time. Service really was unacceptable and in my opinion a failure but the food was the only good experience. 

Hopefully you guys fix your customer service!"}
{"text":"I thought my experience here tonight would be amazing but I got disappointed with their customer service. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but customer service was not that great. 

Right when we got in we were seated right away, the waiter came right away asking if we are ready to our looking like he was in a hurry. So we said we needed a minute so he left and right when we were ready he told us he will back so we ended up waiting 5 minutes for him to come back and get our orders. 
Our orders took more than 20 minutes to come. And we only ordered three dishes. I mean, I understand it takes awhile for the food to cook. My order was pork belly sisig took forever to came he said 5 minutes but it didnt not came not until 10 minutes later. 
Our waiter never came back to check up on us. 
Like, NEVER not even once the waiter came back on us asking if we are still okay or if we need anything. We didnt even get a refill for our waters. 
They were busy serving the big groups instead. 
Me and my friends ended up waiting for him to come back to get our check and to go boxes. 
It was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Ate here a few days ago for lunch and was pleased with the food, service and the restaurant's interior decor/ambiance. I've been to other Max's locations and this one in Vegas is the best by far. The service was on point. Our waiter was nice and polite. Also, the restaurant was clean! Finally, I thought the food was delish! My husband's sinigang tasted like it was made from scratch and not from the mix. I got the chicken and pancit bihon and enjoyed every bite. To top it off, we shared a yummy halo-halo. The reason why I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars is because the menu is more pricey compared to other Filipino restaurants. I guess you're paying a premium for its class! ;)"}
{"text":"They rolled out the red carpet for us - the food was really good and we had a huge party - something like 12 people.  The moved the tables for us and brought us a ton of food all at once - which was really nice.  We took home a bunch of food.  It was reasonable and the service was very good."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group of nearly 50 people. We had the party room and it was nice because it was a little more private. We ordered an array of items per table, my favourites being the fried chicken, kare kare (beef) and halo halo. The service was decent. A little slow but we did have a large group.. would come back for the kare kare and halo halo!!"}
{"text":"There was quite a huge buzz about this place when it opened back in Jan 2011 as this would be the first (am not quite sure) franchised restaurant famous for fried chicken in the Philippines. I remembered my Lola used to say, `Just order Max chicken instead of cooking, I`m tired today!`. So this chain has been around way before I could proclaim my status here on earth.

Place: Modern, clean and the washrooms are very chique 

Servers :Friendly 

Food: Authentic filipino cuisine 
We have tried almost everything!! 
Suggestions: crispy pata, lechon kawali, linagang baka and sinigang
DESSERTS: Do not leave without having their BUKO PANDAN, so gooood!

If you are expecting to get the traditional filipino version of spaghetti, then you will be disappointed. We were, it was watery and almost italianIZED which is not bad if you were dining at Frankie`s. 

They have choices of plain white rice or garlic rice which are both really good.
Small order comes in 3 scoops, whereas the large order comes in 5 scoops.

Prizes are decent. This would be convenient for someone craving filipino food in a decent dine-in experience when one is too lazy to cook. It does get crowded at times and their waiting area is not big enough to cater to bigger families.

The reason why I`m giving this resto a 3STARS is because on several occasions I`ve dined in, it was always a challenge to find our server. And if you plan to order more than 2 entrees, make sure you get the privilege of being seated in the booths as opposed to the TINY tables placed in the middle. 

Kain na! (Let`s eat in TAGALOG)"}

Then the server said \"it's already pre made\" so I guess Max's food ain't fresh and they make you wait half to hour to get your food.

Just because I ordered \"Maxs Plate combo meal\" the server said that's why they don't recommend it because it takes a long time THEN wtf is it on the menu?! They don't have minimum time to take out the food out of the table, just because there's a party going on it doesn't mean you have to use that as an excuse.

Chef needs to be organize on there station not everyone focusin in the party I mean there's people waiting and hungry. 

It's a NIGHTMARE !!!!! Ugh

The drinks like soda cost $2.50 and the server doesn't even ask for a refill they care more other things than take care there tables or station.

And this is the thing he apologize to my mom I mean I am the one who is complaining like wtheck and I ask question I don't get straight up answer ! Yeah I look like a child but don't treat me like a child coz I am an adult having dinner with my mom.

My first exp is the worst already, second was better and then the third one is this one and I don't think I am planning to come I mean my mom said she will never come back too."}
{"text":"Great location, comfortable ambience, delicious food in generous servings,
& most of all..tops in service!!! 

Conrad was our waiter and he's the best! He's efficient, patient, cheerful & very entertaining with his gift of sense of humor. He is surely a valuable asset to your restaurant.

We're proud to have a fine filipino restaurant like Max's in Las Vegas. Wishing you continued success....you so deserve it!

We look forward to our next Max's experience....and we'll highly recommend you to everyone."}
{"text":"Was very excited when my husband and I heard about Max's opening a restaurant in Las Vegas....woohoo!!!
We frequent the Glendale location and wanted to see if this new store measured up to the one in Glendale. We were pleasantly surprised with the ambiance (sosyal,) love the feel of the place. We went in for merienda so that meant fresh lumpia, palabok, halo-halo, and squeezed in their famous chicken. I have to say \"they've got the best chicken!!!\" The halo-halo is to die for (love the little umbrella.) Service was fast and friendly. Our server was on top of everything, we didn't have to look for him to refill our drinks. Von checked on us frequently and made sure we had a pleasant meal. While walking in the door we said \"Let's see if this place is as good as Glendale.\" Leaving we thought to ourselves \"This is the new standard!\" The kitchen, servers, and management are on point. These guys are in the ZONE. Will definitely be back soon for the chicken and awesome service. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good and ambiance is great but I'm not big on eating Filipino food at restaurants. Since I'm a Filipina myself it's better to have that taste of authentic Filipino at a close Filipino friends house cause mama and gram mama can make something way better for free. They over price food for something that can be made quick and easy."}
{"text":"My bf and I had a superb culinary experience here.  Laing, sinigang, and Max's fried chicken and white rice were what we ordered and it was all superb.  The waiter Noah was very nice and the food was served within about 15 minutes - I heard the Glendale (California) location takes about three times as long to get served.  If you want great Filipino food, go to Max's.  Actually, Max's was our second choice.  We were going to go to Wicked Spoon buffet but could not justify paying like 50 bucks apiece to them for food that we probably would not have liked so well, and neither of us is a big eater so as much as I wanted a Vegas buffet, I don't think it would've been worth it.  Next time I am here, I will definitely return!  I'm not a pinoy (my bf is though), I'm a Mediterranean mix, but I love far eastern food, Filipino food especially.  Not sure why.  The food and the people of The Philippines has always been a personal magnet.  Oh btw, the fried chicken is not even really greasy.  The way they prepare it is such that it is not like KFC's or other places that serve \"real\" fried chicken.  The meat was most and delicious.  I am usually a harsh critic - if I don't like something, I let it be known.  But there wasn't anything to criticize at Max's!  How wonderful is that?!"}
{"text":"My older brother loves max's restaurant but I'll have to give them 2 stars. 

Customer service was a joke in this location.  If you have 2 people in your group they will make you wait even if they have a lot of tables open!  The 2 girls said 15 to 20 minutes wait while they go back and forth on what table of 4 they will give to 2 people, it was ridiculous! It happened to other couples that came in behind us too.  SMH. Oh and no refill on our waters. 

For food,  we had kare kare, it had more  food coloring than peanut flavor, meat was tough.  Sizzling pork was just okay,  needed more kalamsi and crispiness.  Bistek was just okay, meat was very tough and the sauce/gravy is too thick.  Garlic rice was good,  I'll give them that.  Halo halo for desert was good.  Buko drink, um no, not worth 4 bucks."}
{"text":"Great customer service!our waiter RJ made sure everything is great! I haven't had Max for the longest time so we tried their chicken, lechon kawali and laing it was spectacular!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Vegas to open a Max's Chicken! I was so excited to know that Vegas was finally opening one.

We arrived before the restaurant opened and there were people already waiting. We were seated as soon as it opened. After 30 minutes, the place was starting to get full. 

The food was so-so. It was good, but not great. I love kare kare, but the one they served lacked taste. Maybe I was expecting too much? Idk. On the other hand, their chicken was amaaaaazing!

The service was great tho! Our waiter, Lloyd, was very welcoming and was always ready to serve us. 

I recommend people to come in early IF they want to be seated and served right away or else you will be waiting for a LONG time."}
{"text":"We sat down and ordered then I checked in and saw how bad the ratings were and started to get worried, but nothing bad happened on this trip. It's a new restaurant and seems to be experiencing the growing pains of learning their stuff while being crazy busy as times with all the buzz of a Max's here.

We got Max's chicken and it was fried the way it's supposed to be, moist with that signature light crisp skin. We got garlic rice to go with it and that was standard, but good and not overly oily. I was just in Philippines a few weeks ago and the chicken was cooked the same way as it was there. 

Pancit palabok. This was decent enough. It was on the saucier side which I actually prefer as some places don't give enough sauce for me.

Our service was good. He was really friendly and kept on our drinks. The turnaround time on the food coming to the table wasn't long either. 

No matter the Max's I go to, I never go during dinner peak times and definitely not on Sundays when Filipinos will flock after church in large groups and this will be a hot spot for Filipino birthday parties. The wait will probably piss you off and while the food is decent, it's not worth waiting a hour to get a seat so don't do that to yourself.  

It's been open only 2-3 weeks so I hope they only get more consistent from here. I'm glad to have a sit down Filipino restaurant though since I rarely eat Filipino food. I hope my visits will be just as positive as this one."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat Filipino food and was told Max's was amazing. Walked in and the place was packed. The reviews didn't seem promising, but I needed to experience it first hand. 

The service was extremely quick and the staff very professional and friendly. When we walked in, the smell of the food was captivating and we got hungry quick. 

We ordered pancit canton, BBQ pork skewers, and sinigang. The food came out rather quickly and we devoured it before I could take decent pictures. Sorry

The pancit was a little too salty for my palate. The sinigang was perfect. The pork skewers had a little too much fat on it but still tastes great! 

The place was clean and organized. The restroom was clean and freshly scented.

Overall, I enjoyed the food and would come back again to try other dishes. 

Foodies, a must try if you're craving Filipino food in Las Vegas, NV."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night. It didn't really seem too busy but I couldn't see the other side of the restaurant. The rating of 2 stars is more for the service and over all experience, not so much the food. We were seated in between a party of 4 and a party of about 10. The hostess shorted us 1 menu, which I guess is fine. It took about 10 minutes after being seated before the waiter acknowledged us, even though he had to practically jump over me to get to the table behind ours. After he took our order, we expected our drinks to be delivered prior to the meal. Nope. We had to ask twice for the drinks to be given to us before they finally were. The food was really good. A bit cold but overall, it was delicious. I ordered the Max's Budget meal which says it comes with Shanghai, but when the meal was given to me, there were not eggrolls on the plate. I had to ask the waited where they were and he said he had to make sure that they were included. Apparently, I knew the menu better than he did. He came back several minutes later with 4 eggrolls and said he forgot them. Service here was horrible. I hope it's b/c it was busy on the side of the restaurant I couldn't see. The food was really good though so I will probably just order take out from now on."}
{"text":"After Sunday church we were hungry. Tapa and garlic rice sounded so good so I came to my favorite place to get it. We were told it was a 20 minute wait to be seated. A few sections were closed which made no sense and it didn't seem that busy to be waiting that long. When we were seated I could clearly see why. They seemed to be understaffed with waiters but had a lot of hostesses just standing around? We waited at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged and to receive refreshments. The waiters were scrambling around to give people's their food and bills and doing everything in between. Although the staff was friendly there were too many large parties here and they just weren't able to cater to everyone dining here that day. Our food also took quite a bit of time to receive. The total time we spent here was well over 2 hours and took up my entire afternoon. After waiting what seems like an eternity to receive our food my usual tapa and eggs dish wasn't plated with the usual round pretty scrambled egg. Then again we came here a while back when they were still in the soft opening stage and maybe that's why the plating was visually more appealing. The spaghetti was lukewarm and the Bicol express tastes entirely different and better in Hawaii. We won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 86/100***

Like I always say, Filipino food is always best when home cooked. There are times though when it's not about the food, but the company and family gatherings that brings you to places like Max's. We were celebrating my mom's birthday and this was the place she chose. We have been to their locations in California multiple times and I must say I favor this location more as it is bigger and decorated better than their counterparts. The several times we've been here, we've never had to wait so that's a big plus!

Items ordered:
Lumpia (pork and shrimp egg rolls) $7.95 - it's your typical tasting egg roll, fried to a perfect crisp. Always a hit with the kids.

Calamari $7.95 - Lightly battered squid, chewy and tasteless. Skip this.

Max Fried chicken $14.95 - This is their specialty. Tender and moist, the crispy skin is the best part and better when dipped in banana ketchup (you have to be Filipino to truly relate to this lol)

Pancit canton (egg noodles sautéed with vegetables, pork, chicken and shrimp) $8.95 - I have had many pancit in my life, this was actually pretty tasty. It's also one of their popular dishes.

Sinigang na baboy (sour Pork soup with vegetables) $17.95 - I have a bias opinion on this one as my mother makes the best soup I've had. Theirs was okay, it could use a little more punch. The eggplant they used was terrible though. I've read one other review that mentioned that as well.

Lechon Kawali sisig (sizzling diced pork belly with diced onions and jalapeno) $11.95 Kapistahan in LA makes the best lechon kawali sisig EVER! I have yet to find a place here in Vegas that comes close to it. Max's version has some redeeming points taste wise but some parts the texture was off. We've ordered this about 4 different times and texture always seemed off.

They have a variety of drinks popular to Filipinos like Calamansi (Philippine lime) and Sago't Gulaman (tapioca & gelatin) for $3.50 each. For dessert I had Buko Pandan $4.95, that was only okay in my book. It seems like the one is California tastes so much better. 

My mom's friend brought a cake from Red Ribbon and they said we could eat it without corkage fee which was nice because some places will charge you for bringing your own cake. Downside was they never brought any plates for it hahaha, we didn't bother as we had some extra ones we didn't use. Service was just okay, our waiter was timid but cordial, we had to flag him down several times for drink refills. I'm not totally opposed to coming back here at anytime as their food is decent. But the quest continues..."}
{"text":"I'm here on a convention next week & we're here for a couple of days prior.  We're staying at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas & my husband suggested here.  I got all excited because I have not gone to a non fast food Filipino resturant in a while. Well. I just left.

First, the hostess was rude.  There was a party of three behind us & she was about to seat them ignoring that we were in front waiting for a table. The hostess asked us very curtly if we were first & we said yes & she made some disparaging grunts. That got the party behind us huffy & asked when they were going to get sat down. 

They sat us down & then ignored us for about 20-30 min. Gave us menus & then walked away. 

Meanwhile, the party behind us got sat adjacent to us, their waiter promptly showed up, took their drink orders, & proceded to bring their appitizers. We just sat there waiting, 10 min later still no waiter. 

Thanks Max's! The only thing I can think of is that my husband is Caucasian & I am Filipino - we pretty much were the only interracial couple there & pretty much got treated like crap. The family behind us was entirely Filipino. 

You really should not judge a book by its cover. I'll be sure to let everyone know at the convention to steer clear from your establishment, as I've never been treated like this."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!

Service is great. 

But food is just 2/5 (considering the price too). Plus the pork sisig is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. 

I'll give a star for buko pandan.
And lechon kawali."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh tasting Filipino dishes that fulfill your cravings for mom's home cooking. Highly recommend the lechon kawali and kare kare dishes. For dessert, halo halo of course!"}
{"text":"Good food. Chicharon bulaklak is the best! Really crunchy! Besides the original chicken they offer chicken inasal too. Which I think is better than the original.
Got to get rid of their soda and go with the best. With so many Filipino food just a couple of walks away you had to offer your best."}
{"text":"I went to Max's for the first time about two weeks ago, on the Victoria Day holiday. It was busy, but not ridiculously so. There were 7 of us & we had Set Menu A (pancit, lumpia, soup, etc) & added things to it. The food was good, a lot like homemade food.  I found it a tad too oily for my taste.  The service was okay. We had one waiter who then started serving another table behind us because we seemed to be taking too long to decide what to eat for his liking. The new waiter we got was courteous when telling us that some menu items weren't available. He seemed over worked though. Poor guy looked really tired with bags under his eyes. 

As for the décor of the place it's pretty basic. Middle of the road tables & chairs. The place is so full of tables & chairs there isn't really any space for much else décor. Dress code is casual. Overall the experience was ok. But if I wanted to go out for a nice dinner this would not be it. Max's is closer to the Filipino version of a fast food type family restaurant than something fanc."}
{"text":"So my friends have been tell me about Max's for sometime and finally decide to have lunch with the family.  

Good food, good prices.

The friend chicken was delicious and tasty
We also had Lumpia Shanghai, Garlic and Steam. 

Over ever was good and that was plenty to go around even ordering small version of the rice was good enough for 4 people with some left over. 

Well definitely  be coming back and try out there different items on the menu"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Asked for asparagus to be added to a tofu dish. Had to repeat it several times to the waiter, he then went to the kitchen to \"ask\" 
When he returned 10 minutes later he said it was to large of a portion for us. We told he we didn't care and to charge us for the asparagus it's fine.
10 more minutes passed and a cook from the kitchen came to our table and informed us the manager would not allow the kitchen to put asparagus with the tofu? Twilight zone, possibly worst service I've had in my life."}
{"text":"Well executed crispy pata -fast service-the milkfish was very tasty. Clean and prompt.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Max's restaurant has very nice appeal to customers also including me, But the service not so great :/. The service was okay but needs to be improved. The lady at the counter when we first walked in was pretty much rude. She almost had a outside voice and just shouted at us to sit down. Plus they don't have enough tables and chairs so i think they might need to renovate. We pretty much waited for probably about 20 minutes to just get a table and maybe and extra 15 minutes to get our food ready. They need to speed up. Don't be a slowpoke actually speedwalk atleast instead of walking like you just hiked a huge mountain or ran a 5k marathon. Plus when my mom order her pancit and sisig her sisig had 2 pieces of scotch tape in it. When she showed it to the manager the manager decided to make half of our meals $7.00 off. I would say Max's is not a restaurant i would often go to but i would say it is okay."}
{"text":"cannot be compared to the original Max's Restaurants back in Philippines :( food is okay. The servers are always nice."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. It's NOTHING like the actual Max's in the Philippines or even the other ones here in the US. The service, the attitude, the quality of food and the prices are absolutely dreadful and pathetic. This particular branch is an embarrassment to the franchise. My family, friends and I, are fans of the brand. If you want to find out the hard way, to actually waste your money to dine here, be my guest. I guarantee that you will be extremely disappointed. I'm surprised that this place is still open. I'll give it a few more months. Who are the clowns running this place? Seriously! There are so many other Filipino restaurants in town, that would have far more better service, a positive attitude, a much more enjoyable and edible food, for the right price! My advice, don't waste your money here. I'm not a hater, I just take my food very seriously, especially when I have to spend my hard earned money. Definitely not at this establishment, ever. (That one star is the lowest. I wish I could've given them no star at all. They don't deserve it!)"}
{"text":"Clean and yummy.

I had halo halo, kare kare, chicken and some soup. 

I've been searching for a clean, decent-looking Filipino restaurants where I can educate my non-Filipino friends. I think I found the right place. 

The price is not expensive and you will get a great value. The garlic rice was yummy too by the way and not too strong - you don't need to bring mint for your first kiss. 

The tables are arranged neatly - the booths by the window are the nicest since tables in the middle are a bit cramped. There's a hand washing sink just outside the bathrooms so you only go to the loo for what it's designed for - pick a number. 

I will come back. Come back often."}
{"text":"All I can say is it's ether a HIT or a MISS ! Ngek. Some days you'll get the best of both worlds good chow and good service and some days will just be \" what Happened?\" Sigh :("}
{"text":"Honestly liked the service.... Everyone was very nice... Ambiance is great. Food was good. The rating here in Yelp made me feel reluctant at first but I am truly satisfied with the service. Disregard the negative comments and give it a try...

Otherwise 

Whats annoying are those feeling \"stateside\" people who are obnoxious and close minded. It's not like I eavesdrop but the loud gossipers kill my mood sometimes."}
{"text":"Came in, knew what we wanted, ordered, and still waiting for our food.  25 min has passed and still no food and no updates.  Others are still waiting for their food as well.  I mean come on now, sisig and soup and rice takes more than 30 min to prep and cook. I doubt that. It's not like it's farm to table.  Max's in Hawaii is faster. Even the waiter knows that the food is taking forever to arrive at the tables.   No compliments to the chef.  Y'all need to hire more staff, cooks, waiters, or whatever so that customers won't be waiting for so long for subpar food. 

I really like Max's, but today you have failed and it sucks that you're the only one in Las Vegas. Maybe I'll drive to Cali for a lesser waiting time for food."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and was worried based on 3 stars however Max was very delicious food and rated 5 stars easy. I think because they were new but have now worked out any issues. We ordered the max budget and Pancit and over exceeded our expectations. The chicken is definitely the best. 
  Service was 5 star also. James asked if our first time and also gave us a sample of bijon Pancit since that's my favorite and wow very very good flavor. 
I would highly recommend Max's if you in the mood for QUALITY Philipino food."}
{"text":"Had dinner around six and ordered the Max Platter.  After my initial taste of the chicken skin, the rest left much to be desired.  Service was okay.  It was nice to see Caucasian couples and others who were not Filipino and not with Filipinos there.  There was a big party of Koreans there.  They must be doing something right!  I might return to try their different ulam."}
{"text":"Such a dissappointment for a well known Filipino Restaurant.. brought my family from florida to eat here and had a great expectation.. we went on a not so busy hour around 2pm for lunch.. theres only like less than 5 tables there including ours.  We got greeted right when we enter the resto ..and got sitted.. our server ( im not going to mention his name even tho his service was soo terrible )  took our orders .we wanted to start with some appetizer but we gave our full order and told our server that we wanted our lumpia rolls to be serve first.. our appetizer took forever.. * take note * it wasnt busy at that time. Our main entrees arrived one by one.. til we started to get so full and didnt finish the rest of the entree that arrived so late..  our drinks didnt get refilled unless told.. didnt give plate for my toddler when theres obviously not enough plate sohad to use the plate from a finished appetizer.. horrible experience. Horrible service.  You would rather eat in a local fil restaurant and have a good experience.. tip was automatically added even tho you would not want to give them that much because of the horrible service.."}
{"text":"I'm very spoiled to have grown up eating just about the best Filipino food at home made by my mom and sister.  Max's restaurant is far from that traditional taste that I was expecting. Do NOT order the lumpia, oh my gosh! That's not what it's supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews of people complaining already...The restaurant JUST opened so, of course there's going to be lines...sheesh.  GET A GRIP PEOPLE...THIS RESTAURANT IS NEW IN LAS VEGAS...

SO ANYWAY ONTO MY GREAT COMMENT ABOUT MAX'S AND THE AWESOME SERVICE THAT I HAD.  =D

I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!!!  I've NEVER had Filipino food before.  Now, I'm hooked and in love!  I have no complaints at all.  The service was FAST, food was great.  I will visit this restaurant again and again.

WHAT I ORDERED:  Ok, so they had a \"teaser opening\"  that I was invited to.  (YAY!)  I had Max's famous chicken, fries, and coleslaw.  OMGGG.  It was juicy, and very tasty.  The fries were nice and hot!! =D and the coleslaw was good.  The server, Noel, had me try the banana ketchup with hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce which (let me tell you) was GOOOOODDDD as a dipping sauce OR just with the chicken's natural flavors.  I can't think of the name of the dessert I tried!!!! AGHHHHH forgive me guys.  I can just describe it...it was in a glass, it had purple ice cream (which was coconut) crushed ice and small candy pieces!?  Next time I visit, I will have my phone charged, and take pictures of the menu.  --Maddi"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! Better off cooking your own food at home. Went on a Friday night of course it was going to be a long wait 45 min. which was expected...Waiting room area was stuffy. Other guest were very upset they were there before the party I came with and been waiting an hour. They do not seat people by first come first serve but what tables are available this was explained by a hostess. I do understand this this is a \"NEW\" establishment with a SOFT OPENING but truly they are a franchise from the Philippines what is the difference in how to run a new restaurant in the States?! I just could not get it. When you visit a Jollibee in the PI and here to me it seems to run smoothly. All the servers and hostess were nice and friendly. 

So our dinner went like this:
Didn't have trouble finding parking walked to the front a lot of people waiting finally they called are name for a party of 3. Got sat in booth area. Jaki waitress comes and asks what we wanted to drink just water all around for now....Water came in 10 minutes after having to hunt her down and asked for the water again. We caught up with Jaki when she took the order from the table next to us then we immediately ordered but no Pancit Palabok no pork sisig..so what now? She recommended the pancit canton and chicken sisig..ok we will get that they did have the chicken ordered that too..order comes around chicken ok, chicken sisig had mayo on it no vinegar taste not even sizzling on the hot plate, pancit tasted like an instant batch you can buy and make yourself. Got the check after hunting her down again then I didn't see her for another 15 min...15 min to run a card? wow found the MGR took him 5 min to go back there total 20 min to check out of here.

I'm not asking for high top notch service but timely service I at least expected some good Filipino food. Try it for yourself if you dare!"}
{"text":"I feel bad because this is my first bad review, but the food here wasn't good at all. I don't know what it was supposed to taste like. It was my first time experimenting with food from the Philippines, but let's just say I'm scared for life."}
{"text":"I've been anxiously waiting for Max's to open since when they said they were going to open back in August. My family and I went here at 6pm and there was a bunch of Filipinos waiting outside...oh no! We were told there was a 40-minute wait so my sister asked how long it would take for a to-go order: 30 minutes. We stood outside and 10 minutes later, our table was ready. Everyone's lolo/lola, tito/tita, ate/kuya and barkada/kaibigan were here. 

My parents would take us to Max's back in Manila when I was little. I liked their chicken a lot that my mom copied their recipe and she got it right. You can't come here and not get chicken and dip it in Jufran banana ketchup.  

We got Max's Budget, Max's Fiesta Plate, calamansi juice, a bangus and halo-halo.

Max's Budget:
Fried chicken leg, rice/fries, lumpiang Shanghai (egg rolls with meat) and a caramel bar. I've said this before and I'll say it again...I don't eat rice. But if I do, I always get garlic rice. The chicken was on the salty side and that's not how Max's does their chicken. My lumpia was burnt and super oily. I like the caramel bar. 3/5 

Max's Fiesta Plate: 
My sister and bro-in-law both got fried chicken leg, garlic rice, lumpiang ubod (fresh lumpia with heart of palm) and caramel bar. The lumpia wrapper was a bit thick but the filling was delicious. 4/5

Daing na Bangus:
Pronounced \"dah-eeng na bang-oos\" not \"bang us\"...mmkay? Or just ask for the fried milkfish. Milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic then fried. Dip in vinegar and eat with garlic rice. Yum! 5/5

Halo-halo:
Shaved ice with kaong, nata de coco, ube, flan, beans, coconut shreds topped with ube ice cream sprinkled with pinipig. The ice to topping ratio was great. Most places will you lots of ice and less toppings. Max's has more toppings than ice and their ice is finer than the ones I've had here in Vegas. The pinipig was great and most places in Vegas  skip it and I don't know why. Sarap!!! 5/5  

There are still kinks to be worked on and I understand since it's only their soft opening. Wet plates from the washer. Our food came an hour after placing our order. The chicken was a bit saltier than other Max's I've been to. My halo-halo went to the wrong table. There's still room for improvement and I'll come back after a few months.

Filipino 101:
Where is da C.R.? = where is the bathroom?
Sarap = delicious"}
{"text":"It was a great experience! Lloyd was a great waiter, everything was hot and came out quickly. The chicken was tender with the crispiest skin. Fast service and great food."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is amazing! We went there for thanksgiving lunch and Ram and Justin were so nice! The restaurant was packed but Ram was so patient with our additional orders, even helping us with our choices. Justin was kind enough to stop, even though he was rushing to get back to the kitchen, just to take our picture. I really appreciated how they didn't seem to mind AT all. 

Music is legit Filipino too (E.g. Rey Valera) which is a plus!

We got Laing (good), Lechon Kawali Sisig (meh), Bulalo (good), Max's Chicken (Ok. To be fair, even the Philippines' recipe changed. Incomparable to the chicken I had during my childhood), ube decadent (goood), and halo-halo (good everywhere)."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The sizzling tofu and Lechon are some of my favorite go-to dishes. Nathan was a fantastic server, would recommend for a nice family environment."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has no deal for lunch menu to go. I ordered half a chicken for $9.95 you would think its a combo. Nope its just the chicken no nothing included if you want rice its extra. And I agree with one of the review it is very loud inside. Very expensive not worth the trip for lunch."}
{"text":"Max's is a great place to bring your non-Filipino friends who you have never had Filipino good before! First, it's full service restaurant and the menu has pictures of the food along with descriptions. Secondly, the service is always excellent and the food is pretty good but I might be biased towards mom and pop shops. The only knock is, it's pricey for Filipino food."}
{"text":"Service is really goodOur server is very attentive..I think someone forgot to put meat in our Kare-kare though lol..lumpiang shanghai was very good and my kids loved it very much! We will definitely come back! Downside is I didnt get to taste the free I've decadence."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at a filipino restaurant.  Surprising considering my gf is filipino, and I'm an honourary one.  I came here with my gf and 3 of her relatives.  

Positives:
Food quality - I really enjoyed the food.  The lumpia shanghai rolls were delicious, as always, no matter where I go.  The fried chicken is what they specialize in, and is a mandatory order, also good.  I also had a vegetarian dish which I thought was really good, even though I don't usually eat vegetables.  

Interior - Better than most other asian restaurants.  This place is new, and so the decor reflects that.  It is a comfortable place, despite the slow service and wait to get a table.  

Location - Decent.  I'm not from the area, so I can't really comment.  But its on a main road, and not out of the way.

Negatives:
Service - the servers had a good attitude, but they are highly understaffed.  The enitre meal took us about 2.5 hours to complete, from the time we walked in, to the time we left.  When we first got there, it was rammed.  They told us it would take about an hour before we got seated, and they were right.  After we finally got our table, it took a while for our watier to take our order.  And even longer for our food to get delivered to our table.  It's not the waiters fault, he has so many table to look after.  

All in all, I would recommend this place, but be prepared to wait to be seated, and to wait for your food to arrive, and well.. really just be prepared to WAIT."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken and soup of the day. Both bland and lacks in flavour. The price was reasonable tho."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the heck of it. Coupla white guys. So the adobo was outstanding as one might expect. The noodles were great. The pork belly was a little too fatty for us, but did taste good. The service was excellent. Very nice to try something new.  Totally felt comfortable."}
{"text":"Maxs is our regular destination whenever to visit Las Vegas....  it is like a tourist attraction that we must see and experience.. Hospitality is always in their heart and food is always great....
This is an actual review of a regular restaurant visitor.

{"text":"Great Filipino food if your not Filipino.  I am Filipino so I eat all the foods that are on their menu.  I recommend the sagot gulaman, halo halo, calamansi juice.  The calamari is good, the garlic fried rice. Mmmmm garlic fried rice."}
{"text":"Went here and thought the place was very nice. However the food was very oily, it was not like the food of Max's restaurant in the Philippines. We were kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"5 star for our server.. shes so polite and very attentive.. the food was great most especially the fried chicken.. \"sarap to the bones\". the ambience is cool too., we waited a little longer but its all good"}
{"text":"Before this place opened a few years ago, I over heard a few of my Filipino friends raving about their excitement to try the infamous \"max's\" straight from Manila.  2 years after, I decided to come try it after my first satisfying Filipino experience with Sampugita. Of course,  we had to try their famous original fried chicken dish that prosper their brand. I was actually quite disappointed. The chicken lacked flavour, you could tell it wasn't marinated even it claimed they had their famous spice. Blah.  I've been to mediocre Chinese restaurants that can make the same thing. No batter, no flavour, no taste. If their famous fried chicken is blahhhhhhh, there's no hope for any other dishes. I've never been to the chain in Manila, so I don't have anything to compare to. But my over all experience was nothing special.   I found everything was quite oily. Maybe it was just the type of dishes we ordered. Overall ,not a big fan."}
{"text":"I have been eating a lot of Filipino takeout and home cook food, when half of my coworkers are from the Philippines. 

Eating at Max's Restaurant today is my first experience of eating in a real sit down Filipino restaurant. 

The main dining area was half empty when I walked in on a Friday afternoon for lunch... no way I would be waiting for one hour to eat here!! There are a lot of different Filipino dishes on the menu..but I am here for the Chicken!! That Fried Chicken... which doesn't use any batter when deep frying but is juicy and crispy... 

I am glad that they do have Meal Combo!! Since most of the menu items are big and supposed to be shared.... the last thing I want to do is to eat a half fried chicken by myself!! 

Meal Combo starting from $6.49.. I settled for: 

Budget Meal ($7.49) 
- quarter chicken with garlic rice and 4 lumpia shanghai rolls (spring rolls?) 
- Chicken Leg is deep fried to golden crispy... and it is pretty light, not too greasy... there is not much seasonings but came with a dipping sauce... 
- Garlic rice.. is quite fragrant... with bits of deep fried garlic inside 
- yummy yummy spring rolls... small little pop it in the mouth size and they are so fresh!! 

Halo Halo ($5.99) 
- My favourite Filipino dessert!! 
- great photo op!! So colourful... and I ate the whole thing all by myself! 
- Just wish that ube ice cream can be a little bigger... or should be at least 2 scoops!! 

My waitress I have was really nice! Big smile and sincere... The waiter are a little bit stuck up.. luckily, they were not serving my table! 

If you really want to try out other items on the menu, it is best to come as a group.. since most of the dishes are over $10 are meant for sharing!"}
{"text":"Great Filipino food that is designed for everyone, not just the Filipino community. The food is of higher quality than the Filipino restaurants we have in my city. The staff where nice and the Chef came out to check on us to see if we where enjoying the food. That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Did the recipe for the chicken change? I haven't eaten at Max's for over a decade and I was really disappointed, in the chicken. The chicken just didn't taste the same to me. Is it wrong to say it tasted to clean? I was craving the deep fried oily chicken. Not to say what I got wasn't good, it just wasn't what I expected. So, did the recipe change? Or did I just expect to much?
I am a huge fan of the chicharon bulaklak it was SO SO SO SO SO (I want to add more SO's but I wont) good! Only downfall is that I burped chicharon bulaklak all day. But it was worth it, so worth it. Not to oily and it was the perfect crispiness.
Not only was that good but so was the lechon kawali sisig. Each bite was flavory delicious. I know its going to be hard, but make sure you don't eat it all because eating it the next day was even better than eating it at the restaurant. Its like eating cold pizza but better becaue its sisig. Eating for lunch the next day, I wish I had more. I was like why does this taste way better than in the restaurant! Well, duh its because the flavor was able to sit for the night and at the restaurant they make everything fresh, or so they say. 
With the good, there's the bad. The lumpia, was the bad. I've never really been a fan of lumpia but I was super hungry and literally ordered everything. I shouldn't have ordered this. I mean thumbs up for having the lumpia in a cute lumpia holder but thumbs down because it didn't taste cooked enough. 
More bad, yes, unless you like your adobo sweet, which then disregard the my adobo review. EW. who likes their adobo sweet? BARF, not me. The adobo was like I said sweet, and the texture was a bit weird, like thick. anyway YUCK. That's my review. 
What else did we order. Did I mention there was only 2 of us. Disclaimer we were super hungry so ordered a lot. 
Oh, the pancit canton, skip it. I'm over writing and its not worth it. 
Lastly, don't forget to get some of those caramel bars. YUM.
Wait, not lastly. We also shared the Buko Pandan, make sure you leave room for dessert. THIS STUFF IS BOMB. I wish I didn't eat so much bulaklak, if I didn't I would have ordered my own buko pandan. 
So, to summarize my review do order the bulaklak, but don't eat too much so you have room for the buko pandan."}
{"text":"Great for sharing side dishes with a bigger group. Tried their laing, kare kare, palabok, lumpia shanghai, sinigang (see photos)

Sharing is caring"}
{"text":"Didn't try the food. Came in with a large group and the service was really poor. No bartender behind the bar most of the time and the guy who finally got behind the bar had no idea what he was doing."}
{"text":"I decided to come back for lunch again from two weeks ago, when I tried the chicken and pancit lunch combo which was just so so.  Today, I went for the Kare-kare ala carte (about $14) with a side of steamed rice.  In brief, I was again disappointed for these reasons:  1) For the price, I felt the serving was rather small by comparison to other sit-down Flip restaurants; 2) While the gravy tasted fine, it was a bit starchy and not as creamy as I'd expect;  3) Veggies consisted only of bok choy and chinese long beans.  For this price point, I'd expect eggplants, and other traditional accompaniments; 4) While the beef pieces were tender enough, there were basically about 4 pieces sufficiently enough for one person.  For the price and being that this is an ala carte dish, I would expect this to be enough to share with at least 2 or 3 people with other dishes.

Altogether with tip (service was fine), my lunch was around $20 which was expected.  However, for just over half this price, I can find other turn-turo style restaurants with a better quality dish.  This is a shame because I truly want to see more sit-down filipino restaurants that can do well and compete with many more popular asian cuisine.

I hope this review will help encourage Max to get back to what gave you the great reputation you once had."}
{"text":"First Filipino restaurant I have ever been too. Great service, very accommodate-able! The egg rolls or the filipino rolls as an appetizer are the absolutely best ones I have ever tasted. Very good and the sauce was just right as well. We tried two noodle dishes, one was the rice noodles and the other was like lo mien. They both were fabulous along with the speciality which is the chicken. It was some of the best chicken I had ever tasted, very juicy and flavorful. We shared it all and that is what I would recommend. If we are ever near these parts of Vegas we will go again! ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"Max's is a modern restaurant with contemporary design serving authentic Filipino dishes. This was my family's first visit to one of Max's restaurants.  We started off with Max's Teasers - lumpiang shanghai, sweet potato fries & calamares. For our entrees, we shared family style and had beef kaldereta, lechon kawali and garlic rice, and our daughter had the calamansi juice.  All dishes were served in large portions especially the garlic rice.  The beef and lechon were just the right flavor & seasoning, juicy and tender.  The calamansi juice was a tad too sweet.  For dessert, we had their yummy halo-halo. Overall Max's Filipino food was delicious and the service was great.  We'll be back to try their famous fried chicken and their other traditional Filipino dishes."}
{"text":"In my life, I've only been to Max's Restaurant twice. Once when I was in the Philippines and twice when I came here. 

My mom really wanted to come here since we don't have one in San Diego.

My family of 9 ordered the Family Set C ($185.00). THERE WAS SO MUCH FOOD. We got a whole friend chicken (already sliced), 2 garlic fried rice, 2 kare-kare, 2 pancit bihon, 2 lechon kawali. Plus we ordered pork sisig and prom bbq a la carte. 

I eat a lot but there was so much food, that I didn't even touch the kare-kare. 

The chicken is not the best (if you compare it to other American fried chicken places like Popeyes or Church's). But, this was the chicken a lot of Filipinos grew up eating and it brings nostalgic feelings.

I would say my favorite would be the pork bbq. They definitely stuffed each stick with so much meat and it had a sweet flavor. 

Service was pretty fast too. We ordered right away and the servers came with our drinks and food within 15 mins."}
{"text":"Your quintessential Filipino restaurant.  If it's your first time eating Filipino this is a good place to start.  Sometimes the service is slow, but it's back and forth.  A great family spot.  Think the Filipino Applebees experience."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally a Max's here in Las Vegas. I love Filipino food, and although this may not be my Lola's cooking, it's pretty darn good. Daing na Bangus is my favorite, along with the Kare Kare. Don't forget the calamansi juice... Yum! Not sure why they some bad reviews, for a brand new restaurant, the service was great, servers were very friendly and attentive, the food was delicious, and the ambiance is awesome! I'll definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times and the food is not bad at all. My GF is from the Philippines and said this place is popular there so I had to try it. The BBQ chicken is awesome! The Halu Halo is so good as well a must have!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE FOR HALO-HALO ONLY

Wow, it's been a minute since we've been back, but I was having a halo-halo craving and we had never had theirs.  After looking at some awesome pictures on Yelp, we came by one night last week and the pics don't lie.  For $5.95 you are treated to one of the best versions of halo-halo in town.  This one had leche flan and the ice was shaved to a great consistency; these are two features that are often lacking in other versions of halo-halo here.   Back in 2013, the b/f and I did a halo-halo challenge where we tried most of the ones in town and we sure missed out on Max's.  It would probably have been #1 or #2 on the list (I still have that list up but I'm too lazy to post the link; you can find it if you try ;) )

So, long story long, if you want some great halo-halo for a good price, come to Max's.  We'll be back.  Masarap!!"}
{"text":"Got my filipino food fix! So hard to be away from home and away from my own family. Gotta get the sinigang baboy(pork), though! The fried chicken is dry... Too bad because that's what they're supposedly popular for."}
{"text":"The servers are friendly, but a little aloof.  I understand that the restaurant is fairly new, but I felt like it was amateur hour.  One of the dishes did not come at the same time as everyone else's and they did not seemed concern until we asked about it.  

The food was okay.  I ordered the chicken adobo.  I liked the broth they used, it wasn't too salty and it was a little sweet.  However it was disappointing because the chicken was dry.  My sister ordered the fried chicken and that was pretty delicious.  It was tender and crispy.  If I ever go back I am probably just going to get the fried chicken."}
{"text":"only thing good about this place is the looks of the restaurant and lots of parking. But if u been to other Maxs restaurant like in the Phillippines and cali, you can tell the signature taste of their chicken and other dishes, but this max restaurant just don't cut it. Their chicken is plain,their sisig greasy missing some ingredients. They're just not the same Max cooking for some reason."}
{"text":"Went here on 7/3/14 with Brian P. for a quick dinner after driving past this place about a billion times. I actually really like Filipino food and the fact that this wasn't a walk up counter where I order two items with a side of rice appealed to me. 

The place looks very nice inside, as do the staff. We were seated at a table next to some older people who were complaining amongst themselves about how the food was cold and not that good. Ugh. Not a good sign.

Looking over the menu, I was a bit surprised at the prices. When I can buy a roasted whole chicken at Smith's for $4.99 right now, can somebody please tell me what is with restuarants trying to sell me a whole fried chicken for $14.95? Value is just as important as quality to me. This food was not a good deal.

Because Brian hates seafood and cilantro and... hmmm, lots of stuff, it was difficult trying to find stuff I thought he'd eat. We settled on sharing the half chicken dinner ($11.95) and I chose the soup of the day which was corn crab (none for Brian) and  the tapsilog $7.95.

My meal was majorly disappointing when it came out. It just looked blah. Small, neutral colored portions on a large plate for $12 just looked chintzy. The corn crab soup had good flavor and that was the only thing that I found delicious. 

I liked the tapsilog but it's basically just steak and eggs with a side of pickled vegetable strips, which were good. It was not a stand out dish by any means.

Service was eh, and kitchen staff could be seen jumping around while wielding a fly swatter in the kitchen. It is what it is.

I've had good Filipino food, and I've had mediocre Filipino food, and Max's definitely falls into the latter catagory."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. 

I will get to the point. 

NOT SATISFIED!!!! 

Food is expensive, they serve you with small portion. It really feel like you're in the Philippines because the serving was really Philippine style. We order for two, but we get the food it was good for one person. It's so a shame!!! MARK MY WORD! THEY WONT LAST!!! If they want customer keep coming back. Serve the food that deserve our dollar. 

This will be first and last. 

I think it's better to buy Chinese food. They give you more for your $$"}
{"text":"There are so many things this restaurant can improve on. 
1) Wait time: It's ridiculous how long you have to wait for food. It took 30 mins or even longer for our food to be served and its not even peak hours (3 pm). 

2) Flat soda: Husband ordered diet Pepsi and it was so flat we had to ask for new one. The new one has some carbonation but because food took so long to come, it was already flat way before actually eating.

3) Waiting area cleanliness. The waiting area had straw papers strewn about.

4) They ran out of eggplant salad. They gave complimentary chicken but my heart was set of some ensalada.  

5) So-so food. The lechon was a little burnt. The beef sisig was weird lol. The chicken  & the buko pandan was their saving grace.

6) Slow service. There's a lot of wondering when we're gonna be served.  
!The waiter himself is nice but the restaurant was not busy at all so I expected faster service. There's a bunch of waitresses just sitting by the corner so I really don't get it."}
{"text":"They made us wait for our table and the reason is that they cannot let us seat because there are still pending orders from other tables. They also keep telling us thAt the table needs to be cleaned first. We were willing to wait but the receptionist are not so gracious and both girls are not even smiling. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and Max's is always one of my destinations for good eating!  Our family had the beef skewers  and egg rolls for appetizers. For the main course we had lechon kawali, pancit, kare kare, nilaga and their famous fried chicken.  Dessert: HALO HALO!!!  All were so delicious!  The service staff provided excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best outside the Philippines and better than some of the branches in the Philippines.
We ordered the classic Filipino dishes and I was impressed on the taste and presentation.
The staff members were genuinely friendly.
I was surprised the place was busy on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Max's Restaurant has always kept their standards high, i always go to this restaurant since the 80s and i still go back and order their chicken, Kare -Kare, Adobo, and lumpia. our family loves to dine here and will always be."}
{"text":"This restaurant has not been consistent in taste and quality.  Service is slow.  I ordered halo halo for $6.99 and the sweet ingredients is less now that their usual servings. What happened?  Don't they want customers coming back and excited to order more and bring friends?"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed and a real bad experience.  We happened to be in the Scarborough area and walked in to Max's Filipino restaurant. It's set up like a fast food.  But they actually take your orders except it is a very slow service.  The place was not even full.  Only 5 tables occupied. I had to wave to get attention.  We were about to walk out since we were totally ignored.  Thought we try this place and stayed. We ordered crispy pork hock, kare-kare and garlic rice. The crispy pata came first.  It was okay but no dip came with it.  Kare-kare came in a black pot full of sauce, 5 pieces of tiny meat and no veggies priced at $19.00. We complained and the server told us that this is how they serve this dish.  Wow!  If this restaurant is using the famous trade name Max's, I suggest that they better evaluate this location.  This is way way below standard and it is not worth the money dining here."}
{"text":"Awesome place.... took my family there last night for my sisters birthday. Customer service was great and the food was even better.

Recommend this place to everyone,  they have the best chicken in town...

The prices are very reasonable for the quality you are getting."}
{"text":"I've been to Max's at their Hawaii location before which is what made me want to try this place. I visited here (8/29) for dinner around 730pm.  The restaurant wasn't empty when I arrived. We got seated right away.

Customer Service (10/10)
They always checked up on our table to make sure we were doing fine & came to refill our water when it was empty. They were super friendly also!

Food (9/10)
We ordered the Max's fried chicken, beef sinigang, pork sisig & Buko pandan. The fried chicken was amazing! The chicken skin had the most perfect crisp. This is what they are known for so I highly suggest the fried chicken. The beef sinigang was extra tangy. I honestly prefer it to be a balance between tangy & savory. But sinigang's are supposed to be more of a tangy soup. My boyfriend really loves the sinigang soup from here tho! The pork sisig was served on a sizzling plate!! Just the way it's meant to be. But it lacked some flavor... maybe a bit more seasoning would've helped the dish. The buko pandan is to die for!!! I recommend this dessert. I love the buko pandan from Max's. It's probably the main reason why I come.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"visited Max's today. Sisig was burnt and overly spiced, also ordered Bistek felt like they smothered it in \" white people \" gravy. GROSS!!!. never coming back again. I'd rather go somewhere else. Thanks for the naseua and the ingestion."}
{"text":"Why is is so cold in here? Literally! We came in the other day to have dinner with family visiting from out of town. Shortly after being seated everyone started to get a chill. I ended up taking my daughter to the restroom when a few girls came in saying how cold they were. Yes, it's hot out, but it doesn't need to be freezing in doors. We want to eat comfortable and enjoy hot food. We ordered soup, rice, pancit, lechon sigsig, adobo, lumpia, Pinakbet, and chicken. The food came out hot, but got cold within minutes. Most of the food was good, but a few things were heavily seasoned. Like the soup we had the sinigang and it was super salty and sour. Even the pancit was a bit salty. For dessert we had halo halo. It was ok but didn't come with Ube ice cream. Maybe they ran out? It's ok max's we'll still come back another time just not anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Decided to go here with a few of my friends to try out this \"fabled Max Fried Chicken\"

In short, definitely NOT going here again.  Although it is still better than the crap they server at Remily's or Jesse Jr.  The food is overpriced for what you get.

We had the fried chicken which it was known for.  It wasn't too meaty and really needed the banana sauce to mask the fact that it wasn't too good.  Popeye's tasted better.

Their bangus was not much better than what you'd get at Marcy's where it  is much cheaper too.  It was pretty tough, I personally like my bangus to be as tender as the inihaw na bangus, but still have the tart from the daing na bangus.

The bicol express was their own style and that was probably the best thing I had over there.

Their Halo-Halo looked nice, but it was just a marginal improvement over Remily's

Honestly, if you want proper Filipino food, just go to Casa, if you're feeling cheap get some takeout at Marcy's you'd have better results for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Never in a million would I have envisioned flying to Vegas to eat Filipino food at a restaurant off the strip and whose marquee lights were out!!!
I'm so glad we did though! We tried some dishes we have not enjoyed in ages - kare kare, lechon, pancit, lumpia, and soup sotanghon. My favorite was the pork belly - juicy and tasty!!

For dessert, we devoured halo halo!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Maxs Fiesta Plate. It came with quarter leg and fresh veggie lumpia. The chicken here was pretty juicy. The skin was nice and crispy. Also ordered the sweet potatoe fries. They add sugar instead of salt for seasoning. All in all it was pretty good. The chicken couldve had a little bit more flavor but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My Filipina fiancee and I tried Max's instead of Jollibee.  It was a spacious, clean dining area.  The menu had lots of Filipino choices.  She had baka, which is a beef soup, along with fried chicken and garlic rice, which was on special.  The baka and fried chicken were good.  The rice, not so much.  The prices were reasonable and service was pretty good."}
{"text":"The restaurant interior was great... it is very well design and comfy as well...
I ordered Max platter for lunch... it was quite big in portion... the quarter chicken was cooked well (and just good to it it with banana sauce) and tasty, the noodle was so-so but the garlic rice was good...
All in all, it was an pleasent experience in tasting Filipino food... i will try their speciality pork belly, milkfish and their kare-kare as all those food looked great in presentation (in other table) for next visit..."}
{"text":"After eating here a couple of hours i got hives and went to Urgent Care twice.  I believe they put too much MSG on their food.  I will never go back here again."}
{"text":"Except for the long wait and understaffed that night, it was a good dine in. I wish they had opened the bar because they would've seated a lot of the hungry filipinos. I didn't want to be too full I skipped out on the fried chicken!! such a regret. The kare kare was soo comforting and ending it with halo halo is a must."}
{"text":"Filipinos go to great lengths to find the next best Filipino restaurant out there, especially when the restaurant carries the name of one of the oldest chains in the Philippines, but unfortunately this Max's Restaurants fails to impress or sets out to disappoint. I ate there on 2 occasions ever since they opened, the first time was lunch, we thought that there would be a long line, but we were seated immediately, I thought great, we can make it back to work in time, wrong! We only ordered like 3 items and it took them 1 hour to bring it to hour table. We had the famous fried chicken, the skin was indeed crispy but the meat was so dry, you would probably need to double up on your soda order since they don't do refills, so Filipino mentality, tsk tsk tsk. The second time I went there it was a friends party, they had pre-ordered the food ahead of time as to avoid the hunger evoking wait, we had crispy pata, which wasn't that great, the usual chicken, pancit, kare kare, adobo that didn't look appetizing at all, over all the food was edible, at least they had a room that can accommodate large parties and give you some privacy. The service was below par, the server just left her cleaning cart in the room while we were still eating and did not really attend to our needs well, especially when you are charging/expecting a gratuity charge for large parties. The napkins were cut in half, so typically Filipino again. I am proud to be Filipino but Filipino mentality really irks me because hey are we not in America? Overall, will I come back? Only if i am not paying for it. Have the Filipinos finally found their white whale? Sorry you will have to continue searching for the best Filipino restaurant out because Max's is definitely sub standard."}
{"text":"A lot of not available anymore for the night and service has no finesse. Waiter is hyper and rushed. Sinigang came in lukewarm, we have to send chicken sisig back as it is also cold. It is only 8PM and a lot of things are not available, The Buco Pandan serving is not as generous as the one in Glendale and West Covina..This is suppose to be their training center so I  expected some good service. Needs a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"My all time favourite halo-halo ice cream when it's hot and humid. It's a Filipino street food. But this time, I was surprised, the serving was small and no more umbrella? What happened?"}
{"text":"This food reminds me of going to a good ol' Filipino backyard party and for me, that's a really cool thing.  Came here with a few good friends who knew the management and we got to meet them so overall a good experience.

ATMOSPHERE: The place is really clean, not like many other Filipino restaurants in Vegas.  The decor is really nice, very reminiscent of a Filipino house and the bar area is pretty nice.  It's not super loud inside so you can tell it's a nice, chill spot to get some good food.  I also like that they have a private area for larger parties.

FOOD:  The food is as good as it gets.  True Filipino food that I could enjoy without having to worry about extra grease or fat, even though not everything is necessarily healthy.  Our group got the \"C\" set menu which included Kare-Kare and Lechon.  Everything was cooked well and tasted true.  The fried chicken was a tiny bit dry to me, but I just added sauce to help it out.

SERVICE:  Our bartender (Heaven) was really nice and kept the bar really clean.  She also served as our server and everyone else that helped out was really nice.  The fact that many of the workers are native Filipinos shows that Max's sticks true to their roots.  No issues here whatsoever."}
{"text":"Finally Max's restaurant is here! We've been waiting for it for a while and now that they're open we have to check it out!

Just so you know, Max's is some kind of a \"fine dining\" restaurant, so expect to wait for a while or a couple of minutes for your order. Me and my husband ordered their famous: 

*Whole chicken (w/ coleslaw and fries)
Surprisingly good and taste like Max's in the Philippines. Love the fries, didn't even try to taste the coleslaw Not a single bite of it, coz it looks so dry. 

*Kare-Kare, taste like kare-kare but it lacks of vegetables. But the most disappointing part was, it has lumps! We asked the manager/supervisor how did they cook their kare-kare he said it's pre made then, they froze it then, heat it whenever there's an order. That explains the Lumps! Lol

*Lumpiang ubod, is nothing without the peanut sauce! It is so plain! Lack of ingredients and doesn't contain the real taste of lumpiang ubod. 
 
We just got disappointed with the food and the price. I don't know if we're still coming back."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service! Definitely order chicken, add in some kare kare and fried lumpiang ubod (suggested by my mister) topped with the ubod sauce! Yum! Staff is really nice, very polite and always has a smile on their face."}
