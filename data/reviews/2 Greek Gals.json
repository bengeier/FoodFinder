{"text":"Perhaps the worst falafel in the world . Super dry and barely eatable . We had to throw away most of it. Also they charge extra for dips . Seriously"}
{"text":"Just had their greek omelet, pretty darn good. They got a good range of options for breakfast and lunch and good portions too. Good place to grab a bite if you're at the Farmers Market."}
{"text":"I like this place.  We shared \"Henry's platter\" and it was a perfect light lunch or snack for 2.  For $10.95 you get greek salad, perfectly seasoned tender bite sized chicken pieces, and tsatziki & pita.  The greek salad was nice & fresh, and they are generous with the feta cheese.  We shared but I could easily eat the whole plate, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Like the rest of the Calgary Farmers Market. Average food, Pricey over-rated and I question how clean that kitchen is from what I have seen. Ate there a few times was not  impressed and wondered why I came back. Even threw out the food after only eating half of it last time.  Found the staff rude and food lacking. Rulla please up your quality"}
{"text":"While looking for fiddleheads at the new Calgary Farmers Market, I stopped by the food court to see what they offered that the Kingsland Farmers Market does not. Because, let's be honest; the produce is not what you go to a Farmers Market in Calgary for. 90% of it is imported from California and BC and what *is* local is outrageously expensive ($8.99 for a lb of local heirloom tomatoes? Pass.). The selection isn't any different from say, Superstore or Safeway.   But what the Farmers Market *does* usually have is fancy lunch noms. It's like the mall food court with a power-up. I headed over to 2 Greek Gals, lured by the enormous display of fresh salads and soured by Los Chillitos' \"cash only\" sign (because I generally will pick Mexican over Greek, NGL).   I ordered the vegetarian eggplant, salad, potatoes and asked for a glass of water. The cashier took my money and tried to dissuade me from the glass of water because it was \"just tap.\" Calgary's \"just tap\" is the cleanest in the country (Vancouver's is the dirtiest, according to a recent survey), so I told her it wasn't a problem. The cashier then disappeared in to the kitchen and came out with one of the chefs. He informed me that they were out of eggplant, but he could swap it out for bell peppers. Yeurgh. I've tried, but while I like the taste of bell peppers (especially when roasted), I do not care for the texture of raw or saut√©ed bell peppers, especially the skin. My heart began to sink, until the cashier mentioned falafels. I asked for falafels instead and was given $1 and some change back.   I waited a few minutes for my food and when they handed me the tray, I had to ask for the glass of water again. I was given an empty styrofoam cup and was told that if I went around the corner and down the hall I could get some cold water. I declined, because I was carrying a tray of food and four grocery bags that were heavy with produce.   The salad was delicious and seasoned perfectly. The falafel, however, was incredibly greasy and overcooked. My guess is that they flattened it prior to reheating in a pan (most falafel places will squish the ball with a pair of tongs when they're putting it in a wrap). The bits of falafel that I got that weren't overcooked were good, though. I also got to sample some of their dips while I waited for my food. Their eggplant dip and mashed potato dip were really good. If it wasn't for the overcooked falafel, I'd give them a solid 4."}
{"text":"Good food, super slow service. I waited 29 minutes for an omlette, others waited longer to get their food."}
