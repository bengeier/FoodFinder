{"text":"The manager of this restaurant sat me and when I tried to ask for a drink turned hi back to me and put his hand up in my face. It wasn't busy at the time. It took the waitress ten minutes to come to the table for service after that, I was ready to put in my complete order but she ran off as soon as I told what I was drinking. Ten minutes later when she brought the wrong drink I ordered my food. Over an hour later tables that sat down after I placed my order were receiving hot food. When I was able to get the attention of a staff member I asked to pat my current bill. The manager asked if everything was OK and I told him he was rude to me when I sat down and was waiting for my order after 90 minutes. He comped the two drinks I had even though I expressed I wished to pay and proceed with the rest of my night, but he refused. As I was leaving he decided to follow me down the hallway. I turned and asked him if he would like me to pay for the drinks and he said \"no\" so I told him to stop following me. I rarely get to this establishment, and will not return to it or the hotel it is attached to. There are too many choices in this market that treat all customers with respect."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting food but prices are very expensive, which is to be expected as it is a restaurant inside a hotel."}
{"text":"This lounge is located inside the holiday inn. The food was only so so. I even let the server pick out the best item on the menu. I wasn't impressed especially after she over sold out so well lol. She was very friendly and attentive. Draft blue moon was way over priced, $8, but it is a hotel bar. Burger was ok, but I expected more for $14."}
