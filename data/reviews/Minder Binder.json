{"text":"Sad what happened to this place...the first iteration with the pizzas was outstanding.  Then, they changed menu and it was less so, but still serviceable and a unique atmosphere.  Went in today and was informed of the changes and didn't even sit down.  It's twice as much to get the same experience you get at the far superior Chuckbox.  Their wait staff, even with the new menu, was always friendly and helpful, now they are gone, and I feel bad for everyone else who has to work there.  Judging from the few positive reviews that mention service and more food options, this is a very recent development, but hopefully everyone reads the most recent reviews to decide for themselves."}
{"text":"I've visited a fair amount of times with coworkers and have never had any complaints up until recently. They recently got rid of their wait staff and  is now a self serve restaurant. I ordered a burger and once it arrived (sat at the bar), they informed me I had to build it myself, literally only got a piece of meat and buns. The bartender also seemed to have forgotten about us. Very disappointed, especially because I had previously really enjoyed going there. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We have been going since it opened in the 70`s. We had the t shirts, Thursday night burger madness was a huge treat for our young family.  We were so thrilled when it reopened and have frequented the place since then.  Consider us cured. The last time we went the experience was so horrible we took the time to email the management.  We never even recieved an acknowledgement. The new process of standing in an eternal line to place your order is completely ridiculous. Along with the food not being up to the standard we had been enjoying, there literally was NO service!  We are sad that we won't be enjoying the place anymore but we have worked too hard for our money to spend it somewhere that clearly does not care about keeping loyal customers. From the discussions we were overhearing while we waited so long in line we are not alone in this decision. Too bad. It could have been great."}
{"text":"I've been going to Minder Binder restaurant since its reopening and have been happy with the food choices and the service. The sourdough pizza was amazing. The pizza has since been removed from the menu leaving regular and predictable bar food as the only choices. Unfortunately the wait staff has now been eliminated which leaves only walk-up service available. I ordered two cheeseburgers and two iced tea beverages for lunch and waited more than 30 minutes for them to be made. Looking around the outside patio seating area there was only one other couple so I was confused as to why food preparation took so long. I doubt I'll be going back to Minder Binders because the very poor service doesn't outweigh the long wait time for average food I could get at Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Fun, different, great food, friendly staff and owners, seat yourself and order at the bar so no need to wait for servers. Effective March 2017 they are adding steaks to the menu of salads, sandwiches & burgers.   If you were in Tempe in the 70's and 80's you probably remember this place with a lot of nostalgia. New owners kept all the fascinating decor both upstairs and down in the old barn and built nice additional inside and outside space around it."}
{"text":"I am an Arizona native, and my first time at Minder Binders was in the early 80's. Off and on over the years I returned. More recently since it was remodeled, my wife and I have been there about 4or 5 times in the past year, the last time before this most recent visit before an ASU football game when it was quite busy. Today however, looking forward to a repeat excellent experience, we just have to ask.....what happened here?  What a disaster. First we arrived and couldn't locate the hostess, stumbled around like morons trying to figure out where they moved the hostess stand. No luck. Finally asked the bartender. He tells us they no longer have servers, you sit wherever you want, you order and pick up at a counter near the bar. We were given a pager......like you normally receive when waiting to be \"seated\". Okay... We placed our orders for a couple of burgers. Weren't asked how we wanted them cooked and forgot to tell them. As for drinks....my wife ordered iced tea, and myself soda water, both of which had to be obtained from behind the bar, and not available from the soda fountain. We decided on a booth \"in the back\" where we always sit. We couldn't locate any utensils or napkins etc., so finally walked back up front and located spoons and forks, but no knives in bus tubs alongside a wall. Any and all patrons were free to rummage around touching and picking up and redepositing silverware in a very unsanitary manner. I know some fast food restaurants provide \"plastic ware\" in a similar display manner, but hardly all just laying in old bus tubs helter skelter. And then the napkins.....you pull them out of a wall dispenser that feels more like you are pulling out paper towels from the dispenser inside the bathroom, rather than something meant to be hygienic. Eventually in a \"normal\" amount of time our pager notified us our food was ready. We walked all the way back up to the front. As we approached the area to pick up our food, about four or five patrons were hovering around \"our food\" reaching for it, and asking if it was theirs, and being rebuffed by the \"server\" behind the counter. My wife had to kind of elbow her way up to the counter after many \"excuse me's\" to obtain our \"baskets\" of food. Not a particularly \"appetizing\" start to a meal, feeling like we are a bunch of lions in the jungle fighting for our food, not to mention once again, the feeling, if not an actual fact, of unsanitary issues. I don't know about you, but I really just don't see the need for people not in our party to be hovering over my food. As we picked up the burgers, we were directed back over to the wall where a line of admittedly refrigerated condiments were laid out kind of like a salad bar......except without any sneeze shields, ......just open containers with people reaching over them to get their tomatoes, pickles, onions, etc. I have to wonder whether this is health department compliant. We proceeded back to our table and proceeded to build our otherwise plain burgers on bare buns. We needed ketchup and mustard.......are you kidding me....we have to go all the back up to the front again? Looked around, and found some condiment caddies on nearby tables that had grocery store like squeeze bottles of mustard and ketchup on them. Brought them over to our table and proceeded to use the mustard, flipped open the lid, and found the underside of the lid crusted with dark, dried up, old nasty mustard. At home this happens, yeah, I know it's not that weird, but at home it's my crap! But at a restaurant? Yuck! Then the meal itself.......burgers dry......likely because they were cooked well done, not medium rare as I would have requested had I been asked (or thought to specifically request) at the time of order. My wife ran out of iced tea....but since you can't refill the drink your self at this \"do everything else yourself\" establishment without hiking back to the front once again to have the bartender do it, she just did without. As we walked out of the restaurant, passing many empty server stations, we remarked that at least we didn't have to leave a tip.....but also noting that we probably will not be returning till the next iteration of this establishment changes once again, ( or more likely goes out of business). Now some of you reading this may find the whole self service thing perfectly acceptable......and I guess it is if you want to go to Smashburger (much better burgers), but wait that's right they bring out the food TO YOU, or Someburros, but wait that's right they bring out the food TO YOU, or even Chik-Fil-A, oh, but yeah that's right even they bring the food TO YOU! So if this style is for you great. But if you are going to Minder Binder with even the remotest idea of it being a restaurant in the traditional sense....forget about it. My sense is they must be having financial issues of some kind, because this radical change to your business model just screams of desperation. Good luck is all I can say"}
{"text":"$5 off all burgers on Mon & Tues! Best patty melt I have had in a long time!! Great service (you order at the counter, get a pager for pick up). The staff is very polite, next time, the Reuben!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great music, awesome courtyard & outstanding customer service. On Wednesdays they offer all day happy hour which means you only end up paying $2 for many of their draft or bottled beers. I think we have found a new watering hole to add to our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a couple of months and was surprised when I walked in.  Burger King with antiques comes to mind.  Got rid of their table wait staff ( although there were 3 employees wandering around)  Order at the bar, refill your own drinks and fix your burgers at the make table.  Not what you'd come to expect from this place.  Food was still Good.  Unfortunately, the food doesn't make up for no service.    This place is off my list"}
{"text":"Some of the best. Highly recommend this place. Very good steak and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I went here with a large group of friends to celebrate a friend's wedding and when I arived I was informed that they don't have ANY service on the patio so we would have to serve our selves. WTF is that about? I don't go to a restaurant to feel like I'm at Chipotle! The food was great the beer was amazing! I would have posted 5 stars if I had a friggin server!"}
{"text":"Really cool that this place got resurrected. Owner is really cool, great beer and food.  Highly recommend if from out of town."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go here and meet with several friends for her birthday and it was really disappointing. There were no servers. You had to go to the bar and order your drinks. No one came to ask if we needed refills. We had to also go to the bar to order our meals. The food was not great. The bread on my mom's sandwich was so thick and rubbery. She didn't even eat the bread after the first bite. I would not recommend going there unless you are wanting to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Brother brought me to Minder Binder and was glad he did. First time here for all of us. Came here on a Tuesday and the burgers are $5 off. Wow.  The burgers were large, very large. I got the Duke with the steak fries. Couldn't finish it.  Excellent burgers and great ambience and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Cool ambience. Very peculiar design. I been here only one time, but in my experience, food and service was great.  Good selection and variety of beers for those who drink. I would have to come few more times to give it a 5 star, since I have not tried more things in the menu. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great burgers! The decor is very interesting to look at because there is something hanging from every inch of the ceilings and walls. Tv's everywhere and ice cold beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this establishment multiple times in the past.  The service and quality of food was always pretty good. Last night was the first time we've been back since the change in ownership. We were having a going-way celebration for a good friend that has been coming to this place for years and considered it her favorite place to eat and hang out. What a disappointing experience!!!   To start off, they have no wait staff now. This meant that we had to order and pick up our own food and drinks at the bar.  The food selection was extremely limited and the food quality left much to be desired!!! Nothing more that greasy bar food. The worst part was the \"clean\" plates and glasses that we received from a passing staff member had bits of food and lipstick still on them and the staff did not seem to be concerned about it.  This is such a shame considering the great atmosphere this location has. Needless to say, we will not be returning and will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was a hang out of mine in the 70's. My girlfriend and her husband are in town.  I told them Minder Binders is open again after 10 years of being closed.  We walked thru the doors and we were time warped back to the 70's.  Had a beer and sat down in the patio which a long time ago would have been the dirt parking lot. I will go back to have their hamburger.  Hopefully, it will take me back to the same taste!"}
{"text":"For what it's worth I ordered a chili,  I got a chili and salad.  They served it to me with a spoon,  no fork.  Interesting,  no salad dressing for the salad I didn't order,  and no ketchup for hubs fries.  Outside of that,  the patio is nice.  I came for a fundraiser,  but I probably won't come back after this visit. Unimpressive."}
{"text":"Self serve with a nicer atmosphere. Food was delicious, I had a salmon salad and the cheese curds appetizer. Wait staff seemed a little under trained, unsure how to answer questions and not familiar with the flow of things. With that said our order was promptly taken, it was all correct and it came out quick. We found a spot on the  patio next to the fireplace with a nice view of the fountain. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was a great place back in the day!  Not sure I recall the food, but it was always a fun gathering for a party.  One of our school mates was friends with the owner so drinks were cheap.  RIP Minder Binders."}
{"text":"This iconic establishment has had a major overhaul  since my past visits. This venue has long been a college hangout and many years ago was a dive. My recent visit was a revelation of a new clean, well lit and friendly restaurant. From the bar area to the outdoor facilities it has been nicely remade. Even the restrooms are clean and modern. I had the chance to meet with the management while I was there on my recent visit and they were exciting and customer oriented. The food specials and the drink prices were better then competitive. Since I was only there for a meeting I did not have a chance to eat, but, several of our members ate and food look very good. They have daily specials which include a 9 oz burger for $ 3.99. What a great deal. This is a must visit place."}
{"text":"What a joint it was...I was the first to get drunk there in 1971...Guarantee...I got there at 11am and hammered drinks and went home.  Went back all the time...Beers were 31cents and mixed drinks 69 cents. They only sold Budweiser and 1 type of booze...Bacardi, Jack etc....  Classic place in its day."}
{"text":"I stopped in here one night with a friend to grab a few beers and some food.  There were no servers, which was fine as we didn't mind going up to the bar to get our drinks.  The problem with this is every time we got a drink, or anyone walked up to the bar, the bartender went on a rant about how prop 206 passed which raised the minimum wage to $10 an hour.  As a result the bar was forced to fire all the servers and now the bartender had to do even more work.  On multiple occassions this spiraled in to the bartender going off on a political rant with racist overtones towards undocumented immigrants and how they're the ones who will benefit while she will be screwed over."}
{"text":"I wish i can give a negative star for this place! They switched their concept to be like a Burger King or in and out burger where you go to the cashier order your food order your drinks at the counter and they deliver tour order to your table ....The whole process stinks! you guys are a restaurant hire your waitresses back and run it like a restaurant.....needless to say we won't be back...."}
{"text":"After seeing an ad for the Monday burger deal, I thought I would try it out.  Every Monday is $5 off burgers and fries.  Price starts at $3.99.  I went during my lunch hour, and was a bit disappointed in the service.  The food was great, but it took a little too long for a lunch break.    I was very glad to see that San Tan Flat did not change the original decor and feel of the place.  It is a blast from the past to walk through the restaurant.    I will be planning a return trip to check out the live music and patio."}
{"text":"Went there when it first opened, service was rough but knew that opening is difficult.  Went back last night and service was even worse.  The whole Cafeteria style that they call it, where you order from the bar, from drinks to food, wouldn't be so bad if 1) someone was actually there at the bar and 2) when they showed up it didn't seem like they were doing you a huge favor in taking your order.   We sat on the patio, as when we first went that was a draw for us, but it smelled of cat urine and the second hand smoke was overwhelming.  Food was OK, price was higher than I expected for a restaurant that makes you serve yourself.  Wont be back and from the looks of it, lots of other people made that decision as well.  Too bad, could be awesome if they wanted it to be."}
{"text":"Walked in hoping to have burgers, sat in booth with our family. No one came over to our table To get drink orders or food, people at bar enjoying rhenselves, but not even the bartender to shout  out hello , we will be right with you.. We waited, noticed no waiters or waitress,  got up and left.   Don't waste you money on a place were there is no service, go to Four Peaks instead.  Tell everyone our experience."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am the first person to review this.   Okay, this is off an experience 6 1/2 years ago. A friend of mine from here in Boston was visiting me while I was out in Vegas still. We went th Phoenix to see a game at then-Bank One Ballpark, and we asked a bartender at a spot near the hotel where to go to drink our faces off. This was recommended.  Well, we get there and this place looks like a freakin' barn, literally. We got in in time for the penny draft rush. Two of the bartenders were from Boston, and immediately we felt at home. Now, this is the typical college bar crowd, so be warned. I probably wouldn't go now, but I had a blast when I did.  The best was going to the restroom, seeing what I could only describe as a long pig trough for a urinal, and overhearing a guy coach his buddy onto the right way to take a piss in these things because there was a \"splash factor\" involved. I nearly peed on myself from laughing. I didn't, though. Years of practice helped."}
{"text":"Last night we went there for dinner after my daughter's graduation.  I was told their kitchen was open till 10pm and they were \"technically open\" until 11pm.   There were 8 of us and were told there was a table in the back that would accommodate us.  We were the only ones there and felt like they just wanted us to leave so they could go home early, I sent my 32 year old son up to get menus and make sure everything was ok, he came back and told us they would feed us but they defiantly didn't want us there.  We ended up leaving and going to to Four Peaks right around the corner, (the food was awesome and found two beers I really liked)."}
{"text":"Rock on...I worked there when it opened in '72 for several years.....worked with some of the greatest people and met so many nice people....have so many good memories of MB...I want everyone to know that I was the calm mature employee...nice to see that someone is going to restroe the name and reopen MB..."}
{"text":"The Beer was Ice Cold, The Burgers were spot on perfect, and tasty like they should be. Excellent Onion Rings....  Great service and well taken care of.  Love that they retained most of the nostalgic decor from when I was there back in the 80's & 90's.."}
{"text":"In 2015, after an extended closure, Minder Binders re-opened its doors to customers. Praise the powers that be!   Your experience will differ based on where you sit and the level of nostalgia you feel/welcome.  I've been here 3 times since Minder Binders has re-opened. Service has been good, very good, & exceptional respectively on those visits. Here's the 1-5 rating on the food we have tried:    Bacon Cheese Burger 4/5 - cooked to order    Shrimp 3/5 - too much breading for me    Fried Pickles 4/5    Wedge Salad 5/5 - just as damn good as a cold, crisp, & refreshing as salad can be... dayum!    Wings 2/5 - sauce needs work  Stripped down to the cold impersonal facts this is a 3+ Star joint now. It's got 4+ potential though, 5 with the right customer attitude and approach.   \"But what's the holistic view?\" you ask. \"And how, sir, can I maximize my Minder Binders experience to get that base+1 kicker?\"  First, let's thin this gig out to just those that can benefit.   If you are a power-mongering dick to service people, high maintenance, hard to please, snow-flakey special, or otherwise exhibit tendencies toward douchebaggery, please exit the review & Trouble Not the good people of Minder Binders. Still with me. Whew! Yeah, I know, they're everywhere now. Glad they're gone.  \"OK, so what's the big deal?\" Minder Binders opened in '72. I've been a customer since '77. For a complete understanding of the namesake and the whimsical old-timey interior design, you're going to need to read Joseph Heller's Catch 22 (ref. First Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder). Barring that, just understand that Minder Binder's, the Big Red Barn in the Middle of Nowhere restaurant, is a multigenerational icon in the valley. It was a magnet for ASU coeds and starving lads clamoring for their attention. It catered to burger, volleyball, hermit crab race, & beer enthusiasts alike. There was Burger Madness. There was live music. There was... naked everything. What? Yup. Playboy centerfolds shellacked onto the walls everywhere. Naked creatures on the bathroom doors, anatomically depicting the designated sex for that restroom. Much craziness there was. Even Yoda was naked. Seriously, in '77, at age 12, I was learning more about female anatomy just sitting in a booth at Minder Binder's than I ever did from the Mesa School District. What? No, don't even start the \"creepy\" BS with me. I was 12. TWELVE in 1977. Don't make me beat your porn-at-my-finger-tips-through-my-$1000-phone-judgemental ass. Grow up.   \"Where should I sit?\" You should sit inside. Don't argue, just sit inside... inside where all the historic, quirky, crazy, decor is located. Talk to the fishes (you'll understand later). Just ask to sit inside for God's sake. I'll try to be brief, but for cryin'-out-loud, if you go to Minder Binders and REQUEST to sit on the Patio, I just don't understand you. I don't understand sacrificing brain-tickling will-never-forget-it decor for a view of the freakin' parking lot, unattractive adjacent businesses, & the mundanity that is Hayden Road. Seriously, evaluate your life decisions.   Gotta wrap this up. I've rambled on here quite a bit, perhaps due to the rambaloney & cheese sandwich I just ate.  \"I'm not old like you, how do I ascend to that 4+ experience with that nostalgia stuff?\" If you recently moved to AZ or are under the age of 30 you may never have had a chance to experience the OG Minder Binders. And really, OGMB was early 70's to about mid 90's. No worries, as soon as you step inside it will start to hit you. On entry, you'll osmotically soak up some of the thick nostalgia just being there. But it's all on you. If it doesn't work, it's you. Pro tip: accelerate the process (and your joy) by rubbing elbows with the veterans. They're easy to spot. Try asking: \"who know this place from back in the day?\" Just see how many heads turn. Buy one of them a beer. A beer for a story is fair. They'll spin hop-soaked tails of Burger Madness, Volleyball, & other craziness. Hell, I bet they buy you a beer right back. Anyway, soak up the history, make some of you own, be social, have a blast.  Recommendations to the Minder Binders staff/owners: The wing texture is on point, but the \"hot sauce\" flavor (not heat) is weak and off putting. Tabasco-absolutely-required type off putting. Take a look the First We Feast youtube channel Hot Ones show for some ideas.   From my wife: drop the Coastal Chard. Hess should be your base Chard and your upscale should be either KJ or La Crema. Folks will be OK paying extra for either of those.  Sincere appreciation for acquiring, renovating, and revitalizing this signature locus of my young-punk days and mind. Exceptional job preserving the history, look, and feel while ensuring greater capacity to serve and a sustainable future. Scale done right = profit and business continuity. And you know I needs me some Burger continuity.  Thank you owners & investors, management, servers, and kitchen staff. Virtual hugs all around."}
{"text":"Heard about Minder Binder from a friend.  We decided to go on a Tuesday, mid afternoon.  To our surprise, the burgers are all $ 5 off ! (every Monday and Tuesday)   We each ordered a burger, but we probably should have split...they are really big.  I ordered the Duke.  It was the BEST BURGER I've ever had in a restaurant, and I order burgers quite often.  Your original order is placed inside at the bar, they give you a buzzer and when it goes off, you hold it up and someone brings you your food.  The wait staff was efficient and friendly.  If you like burgers, I highly recommend this place.  We will be back...and we are planning on bringing a lot of our friends and reserving the upstairs dining area.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic. Just looking around the restaurant you can see the history in this place. Firepits and music set the mood.   The food was great and service was quick. Our party tried various meals. The ribs, the steak, the burgers; everything was fantastic.   As we were getting ready to leave the live band started playing.   This restaurant truely is an experiance."}
{"text":"We have been here several.tomes since the reopening. Last night was the first time since the concept was changed. The servers are gone and we had to go to the bar for a menu and to order. Reminds me of Burger King or McDonald's.  The food would have to be exceptional for me to serve myself, but it's not.    There are slot of places in Tempe to get. Burger and beer I doubt will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great place with even better food!  Owner has great hospitality and the vibe and ambience of the place is so incredibly nice. Great job! Not from az but this will def be in out Stop every time we visit. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably would have given more stars if I could have tried the food. Sat there for twenty minutes and no one even acknowledged us, despite someone walking by every few seconds to refill salt and pepper shakers. Would not revisit again, especially considering how dead the place was."}
{"text":"This is one of few GREAT reviews I've given any restaurant !!!!!! There were 3 of us and we all got something very different.  Everyone of us got a most delicious meal. I myself got a patty melt (I'm alittle fussy with the hamburger) very little to no pink and it was made perfectly, and I might ad very juicy.  This being hard to do anywhere \"this chef knew what he/she was doing\"!!,  The steak fry's were cooked to perfection (crispy) as should ALL french fries.  I would most definitely recommend you try this hidden gem.  Yes, I know it's been around for over 40 yrs and in the past couple yrs newly remodeled and open...So try it for lunch or dinner and you'll be pleasantly surprised.."}
{"text":"I love being able to order Shiner on tap and the best part, they deliver it with a ice, cold frosty mug. Spacious upstairs and downstairs seating with a lovely patio for outdoor enjoyment.  I've not eaten here but have enjoyed a nice glass of scotch and it's a reasonable pour compared to most bars. There is plentiful parking and convenient to 202 and ASU.  All is great yet main issue that separates them from a 5 star to 4 star rating is that they really need to not rush paying customers who purchase beverages close to last call. Just because you are not busy and the staff wants to leave is no reason to rush patrons out the door.  Other than that, I enjoy the place and will be back."}
{"text":"The outside might look different but the heart of the place is still the same ....new patios and outdoor seating but food is still great ....I had the burger and a beer it was fresh and delicious....menu is limited to burgers, salad and pizza for the moment hopefully they will expand"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, huge bar and open courtyard. This place is massive but feels very cozy inside because of the way the booths are tucked away. I was there on a Monday, which was $5 off any burger (which are normally about $11) - the burger was decent but nothing to write home about. The beer prices were lower than average ... so that's great ($4 for a premium draft)."}
{"text":"is this place still closed?  hope not.  i want to go back and relive my past..  peanut shells on the floor, great burgers, trying to figure out the signs on the bathroom doors. climbing the stairs to the upstairs, trying to figure out how they got all that big stuff hanging from the ceilings."}
{"text":"I am the catering manager for a fairly large locally owned company. I work inside a restaurant five days a week. So maybe I'm a little bit sensitive. Our dining experience tonight San Tan minder binders or whatever you call it now was abysmal. Wait in line to place an order? And then come pick up your own food? And when you want condiments on your burger? go to the Burger Bar which of course isn't marked anywhere as the Burger Bar? The whole was just frustrating and irritating. If I want to wait on myself and take care of myself I'll just stay at work all day. On top of that your menu is ridiculously small and limited. Blah boring. Oh yay! You have hamburgers and chicken strips. So does everybody else. I can get chicken strips at Jack In The Box for $1.99 that are way better than yours could ever hope to be. Funny story my parents and myself almost bought this place to restore it back in the mid-2000s. They really did a great job and it looks fantastic. But the menu and having to order your own food it just doesn't make for a great happy hour or dinner for anybody. At least for me and my family."}
{"text":"This place looks pretty cool on the inside. The food is decent but the service is pretty Meh... I went at lunch time and we had to order at the bar (which is fine) and they bring the food to the table when it was ready. They brought utensils for 2/3 of us, and the server even noted that one of us would need an extra set...but they never came back, so we had to go looking for utensils. Would be nice if they'd told us to pick them up when we ordered our food.   They had a sign for free line dancing lesson later that night so we came back... then no instructor ever showed up, plus no announcement or apology! Just a bunch of people standing around and ordering drinks waiting for dancing... after a couple of hours, we called it quits.   If you like country music, you'll like it here but other than that... honestly just go to Four Peaks Brewery on 8th street. It's not far and their food+service is better!"}
{"text":"Wonderful find.  Excellent patio service from Sierra.  She knew everything on the menu and walked us through with suggestions.  The food is top notch.  Nothing frozen in the kitchen, they even grind their own beef for burgers!  All food is from scratch and very nice recipes to boot.   They make their own barbeque sauce for the fall off the bones ribs. Country music piped through the sound system AND... live  country music Friday and Saturday evenings on the patio.  The weather is cooler now so come on down! Don't miss the deserts, all made in house and delicious.  Saw a great looking piece of carrot cake walk by.  We decided on deep fried cheesecake, which was unbelievably good! Prices are  very reasonable.   A very nice experience."}
{"text":"Teetering on 3 stars but giving 4 for sheer value. There are some downsides though:   1. Parking. Holy tight spaces and - out of the control of the restaurant- some pretty idiotic parking attempts by patrons. It was full fledged trickery getting in and out of there.  2. Ordering. Not a fan of the walk up ordering. Getting additional drinks (or separating apps/meal) if you're on the patio is annoying when you're with a group.   Why 4 stars then?   1. Not sure if this is every Tuesday but the burgers were SUPER cheap and really good! I had mushroom Swiss. From the meat to the fresh toppings bar, it was on point & unfooled-around with as a burger should be.   2. Cheap apps. Wings, cheese curds, fried pickle sticks - all avail around $10 or much less   3. PLENTY of space inside or out. The courtyard patio is really nice, too.   All in all, worth it to suck it up and figure out the parking for a perfectly priced patty :)"}
{"text":"Very engaging atmosphere and great food but even though they have dinning rooms you're expected to get up from your table to order food, drinks, even utensils?! Regardless of that pretty cool place to bring the family or date to enjoy some live music and dancing."}
{"text":"What a great piece of AZ History!  Now if I could only find out if someone will sell the Creature from the Black Lagoon that was inside!"}
{"text":"Got the turkey wrap with a side salad at lunch.  The salad was a standard side salad and it was a standard size as well.  The turkey wrap was actually really good.  I'm not sure what the sauce they served on the side was, but it didn't add a whole lot of flavor but the wrap didn't need it.  A bunch of coworkers got burgers, which looked really good (which they should be since half the menu is different types of burgers).  My wrap was reasonably priced at under $10 and it was actually cheaper than the mesquite chicken salad I was going to get.  The service was pretty good too.  We sat in the outside patio so I'm not sure what the inside is like but it appears to be friendly for sports fans.  I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"On 3/20/2017, we went to Minder Binders for monday burger madness and we had a baaad experience. There are no real waiters/waitresses, you order from the bar your drinks (alcoholic or not) and food. This  gets to be chaotic when enough people are at the bar at one time. No real structure for a line, so it is who can talk the loudest to get the staff attention. You are given a buzzer so when your order is ready you go get it at the bar, I was on my way to the bar and a person was bringing it to me. One of the orders was not ours, so she left with the incorrect one and then brought back another plate, this time it had the correct burger and the wrong type of fries. But I thought oh well  and started to separate the fries on my plate with the onion rings on my husband's plate (we like to share). Then the server returned for the third time with the correct burger and fries, I told her I had already fingered all the fries and she said not problem they would replace them before they served the plate to the correct customer. Here is where it got worse, I took off the top bun to add my garnishes to the burger and found that someone had added a lot of ketchup to the burger (I HATE ketchup). I ordered the Jiffy burger, it does not come with ketchup. So that meant that my burger had been touched by another customer and then served to me. This is an unacceptable mistake. My husband took the burger and returned to the bar to explain the situation to the staff and the same person that served the wrong plates reordered my plate without even stating they were sorry for the mishap. I finally received the correct order 20 minutes later after my husband had finished. The burger was good once I received the correct order.  Not sure if all the establishments that this family owns are run the same way, but it does not work at this location. If by having general serving staff (runners) than assigned table servers is to save money, I suggest that this plan be rethought."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with gorgeous patio seating! They have fire pits and hanging lights. The food was delicious and not badly priced. The restaurant had been in Arizona for years and years but they recently did a remodel and built this new patio. Perfect for a date night or for group get togethers."}
