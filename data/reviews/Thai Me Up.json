{"text":"As soon as I visited here, I knew I had to bring my aunt (who lived in Thailand).  She loved it!  The dumplings are probably the best I ever had.  The staff all have such friendly personalities.  I am surprised to see the negative reviews - this has become our favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pretty nice, food was bland, and the wait staff reasonable but didn't try to be helpful. I didn't hate this place, but I can't imagine that I'll be back."}
{"text":"The spicy basil noodle was excellent! 
(I would like to say it was the best stir-fried noodles I have ever had in Pittsburgh)
The mushroom lemongrass soup was a bit too sweet, unlike usual Tom Yum. 
However their special lunch set was quite small, compared to lunch set in other restaurants."}
{"text":"Out in Pittsburgh visiting friends and I wanted to sample the local Thai food.  This place was great.  Friendly, fast service and the food was phenomenal.  Thai Me Up made feel like I was back at The Red Chair restaurant in Phuket.  If your in Pittsburgh on the South Side and feel like Thai give it a shot."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and had heard good things. 
As other reviewers mention, they certainly have a staffing problem. The night we went, there was only one overwhelmed waitress so service was poor. She was nice enough, but did not have time to check back on us/fill drinks etc... The highlight of the meal was the crab rangoons which were delicious. My husband ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp & chicken and I ordered the chicken with basil & pineapple. His was ok, not much flavor but decent. Mine was really bad. The sauce was tasty, but the chicken was horrible. It was overlooked and so tough I could not cut it with my fork (we had no knives.). I tried two bites and couldn't get over the texture. The waitress never returned to check on us so we eventually just flagged her down for our check, paid our bill and left. 
I wanted to love this place. I did enjoy the decor/ambience but the food was disappointing. Not likely I will return."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but not great. I had the lunch special for $5.95, which includes a (tiny) spring roll or lemon grass soup and a manageable portion of one entree. I had the spring roll and tofu pad Thai. The spring roll was very good. The crispy tofu in my pad Thai was cooked to perfection, and the sauce/seasonings on the pad Thai was good, though slightly vinegary for my taste. The service was good and very fast, and you can't beat the price! In all, a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great lil Thai place. Good food, good service, good location, and some fun dishes that are worth exploring. It's a little place, so probably better as take out. But I enjoyed the eat in"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for lunch. I've been for dinner a couple times but more times for lunch. It's a small place and can fill quickly. They've a small but well chosen menu. I love the phad thai. I got to other thai places as well but have not found a phad thai I like as much."}
{"text":"Really great, speedy service. My pineapple fried rice was delicious, and the portion was big. My spring rolls came out piping hot, crispy, and delicious."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely terrible experience at Thai Me Up. Three different entrees were ordered and all three were horrid. 

Let's start with the Pad Thai. The noodles were undercooked to the point of being raw. The sauce was so sweet it was inedible. There were no bean sprouts, and one burned tiny piece of an attempt at an egg. 

The Green Curry; Once again, sweet. How do you make a Green Curry too sweet? I don't know, but Thai Me Up sure does. 

And finally, the Fried Rice. This was literally just rice, and roughly a dozen strips of Green Pepper. 

Thai Me Up sells the \"Authentic Thai\" experience. Unfortunately it does not deliver. My wife and I have both traveled throughout Thailand numerous times, and Thai Me Up comes nowhere close to being Authentic."}
{"text":"The food was on the downside of average and the service was non-existent.  The two waiters really appeared as though they did not want to be bothered.  I really never should have sat down.  I had Thai fried rice and soup.  Nothing difficult.  Needless to say, that was my first and last time there.  The place was not inviting."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as well as have gotten takeout. The food literally tastes like chalk. Very bland compared to the other thai places in the area. Steer clear... really not worth it with such other great choices not far from here (smiling banana, nikkis to name two)."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. First time at new location and I really like the large garage doors and seating. Great natural light. I had the fried tofu salad. The tofu was very good, not over fried. The dressing delicious. The lettuce is just iceberg. Would want something a little different, more substantial."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! Love the green & red curry chicken. The spring rolls and Thai iced tea are awesome too."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. For 6.50 I got a delicious mini spring roll and the ZU noodles. It was very tasty and I couldn't eat it all. Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"They recently revamped their menu, keeping the great entree's they already had.  Added excellent new curries.  I know people always get the same thing they first get here, but I would encourage them to try the new ones!  The mussaman (sp?) and salmon red curry are both easily my two new favorites!  I would say this is my favorite thai place in the city!  The place is usually run by only one or two servers as the floor is not that big, which gives it a great feel.  Sometimes it does get busy but the staff is always very friendly.  I would say rude customers get agitated but the staffs attitude about it always keeps me patient!  I love this place and it definitely deserves 4 stars for the food with an extra one for the staff!!!!  I can't wait to go back and keep working through their menu!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried on the menu has been delicious. They have recently added an Enoki mushroom appetizer and it is yummy. Also, the tofu appetizer has a really great flavor."}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Me Up at number of times. I have eaten in a few times and gotten take out for lunch a number of times as well.  It's in a good location on the South Side.  I was never at the old location but the current location is a pretty good spot.  I've probably been there about once a month over the last year.  

The Good:
- The ambiance and decor are very cool.  There are garage doors that they can open on warm days that are a nice touch.  They also have an old-fashioned cash register that is a nice antique.
- It's a very clean, relaxed environment.
- The staff are always really friendly and the service (eat in and take out) are very quick and efficient.
- The lunch combos are pretty reasonable - $7.25 for a nice selection of different dishes.
- The lunch combos come with a spring roll and a dipping sauce that are excellent.

The Not-So-Good:
- The food quality is not consistent.  I tried different dishes the first few times I was there (Spicy Basil was a great start!) and eventually tried the pad thai.  The first time I had the pad thai it was very good.  Great flavor, just enough sauce and a good portion size.  The next time I had it the noodles were really soupy and very fishy (waaay too much fish sauce).  The last 2 times the noodles have been pretty dry with almost no sauce, which meant there was not a lot of flavor.
- I got take out from there today (dry pad thai) during my lunch break at work and got sick less than 2 hours later, with subsequent trips to the bathroom at 15 and 20 minute intervals.

Overall, it is a decent place to go - a cool environment with hit-or-miss food, however I will be avoiding for a while after getting sick from eating there today."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I probably will not be back.  I have never been treated so rudely before in my life.  I came here yesterday with my sister for lunch.  The dining room was busy with one server who I have to assume was Sir Ben Kingsley, not only by his stunning resemblance but by his overwhelming pretentiousness that I have to think comes along with being knighted.   Anyways, the server was extremely rude as I ordered for myself instead of letting my sister go first.  I was planning on ordering for her and asking questions about the menu, as she has never had Thai food and is often very shy when it comes to these situations.  He cut me off, made some snarky remark about letting women go first, then turned his back on me and took her order.  She didn't know what she wanted because I never got the chance to ask the server questions so she just picked something.  I also never got the opportunity to tell him I wanted my dish spicey, so neither of us enjoyed our meals.  When our check was brought, he made another smart ass remark about me ordering first.  I have never been treated so rudely before by someone in the restaurant industry, and I don't plan on returning to be treated like shit again.   The soup was good tho.  If you like good soup and also some clown acting like he's better than you while serving you food, then this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the Thai places in Pittsburgh, this one is the worst.  I know, that sounds rude, but it's how I feel, and I eat Thai in Pittsburgh, and in other cities very, very often.  Thai is my favorite type of cuisine, especially Thai Curry.  

Their curry is rich with fish sauce flavor, and that's not a good thing.  You shouldn't be able to taste the fish sauce in a good curry.  Their noodle dishes like their Spicy Basil Noodles or their Pineapple Chicken are all right if you are hungry and stuck in the South Side (most decent restaurants are not nearby, and I live up the hill).  The problem with their noodle dishes is that they are too greasy.  

They are typically nice here, yet not as attentive and friendly as I'm used to at Thai restaurants.  It's basically, \"hello, what would you like to eat, and then the check\".

My husband refuses to eat here anymore, so I trek over to Thai Cuisine or Zaw's instead."}
{"text":"Awful foul mushroom soup. Asked for eggplant basil zero heat, it came back spicy with 2 leaves of basil! one dead a week ago! Never again"}
{"text":"This is the best thai food restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their new location has a much nicer decor than the previous one. I enjoyed the spicy basil noodle dish as well as their chicken stir fried rice."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Thai places. Everything is great, but I particularly recommend any pineapple or basil dishes. Lunch has great specials @6.50 for a smaller menu of dishes and includes soup or spring roll. The dinner prices are still pretty cheap (cf. The Silk Elephant in Squirrel Hill) Also the art was really cool when we went."}
{"text":"Terrible. Brown, greasy, lacking in vegetables. More like Chinese fast food than Thai food.

Verdict: average prices & extremely shitty food"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Thai Me Up today for lunch. When we were seated we were the only customers. The server brought over two glasses of ice water. When I said I didn't want ice water he said I should have informed him of my preference before to avoid wasting before. VERY RUDE I thought given that he didn't come over to our table to seat us prior to bringing the water so how should I have told him? Next, when he brings the water and ask if we are ready to order my friend says she needs a few more minutes. As he is turning around I say excuse me, trying to order an appetizer. He walks off saying he will come later. VERY DISINTERESTED, I think. I find another and ask for straws and she politely brings them over. Then for the finale my entree, Pad Thai is sweet beyond belief and has no vegetables. After trying to eat I call him over and he claims that this is how they make it and the chef has
followed the receipt since he was watching over and walks off. I have had Pad Thai at Thai Me Up before and this is not how it tastes or looks. Second, he was running tasks in front of me so he could not have overseen the chef cooking. Bottom line: very very very bad customer service."}
{"text":"I give Thai Me Up five stars because it is a Pittsburgh staple to me.   Whether it be lunch or dinner  I am a huge fan of this place.  Lunch is awesome and they have a great special (which other reviewers have mentioned) and I like that it is a tiny restaurant with no frills.  It makes it an easy go to when you just want something casual that you know will always be great. 

I love dinner here because it is BYOB with a minimal corking fee.  I always get the Spicy Basil Noodles or the Pineapple Curry.   It is great, cheap, Thai food that doesn't disappoint"}
{"text":"Excellent bang for the buck. A delicious meal. Fast friendly service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty forgettable... We had the chicken pad thai, which was very bland and lacked texture and the spicy basil noodles, which was better but not something worth running back for. The place was very quaint and cozy and the people were quite nice. We are good food lovin' folks and this was not the place for us."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and I've definitely had better. I got the Pad Thai and it was watered down liquid on top of noodles. Very bland. Could barely taste the \"sauce\" and there was nothing else besides noodles in it! You can make better version by buying a frozen Pad Thai in the grocery store.

Parking is atrocious (obviously- it's the South Side). 

The thing that bothered me about the restaurant was I went there with a group of friends before the dinner rush. The dining room was empty and we were told to sit anywhere. The 3 of us took a nice table set for 4 in front of the windows. At the end of the meal, as he was taking our tips/credit cards, the waiter berates us and tells us to never take a table for 4 again or he'll make us move. The dining room was still empty.

Go somewhere else - not worth the time."}
{"text":"I had take out chicken pad thai. Easily the WORST pad thai ever. It was UNFLAVORED. the chicken was extremely dry, and this was almost $11! The portion was very small. Even after three tablespoons of hot sauce, this thing still tasted bland."}
{"text":"So good, so cheap.

Love this place! I had the garlic, chicken, eggplant dish -- my nephew got another entree, plus we shared the fries and satay chicken, all for about $25. 

Not bad, eh?

And it was delish. I truly loved everything I ate here and if I had left enough room, I would have shoveled down an order of the sweet sticky rice. 

Mmmm!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow! So good! Love the coziness, and the spicy, delicious food. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was here with friends for lunch looking at the reviews in urbanspoon. I was wrong for the first time. Ordered Pad See U, which i order in every thai. I got the dish which had a lot of soup and had a weird smell to it. I complained asking if i ordered the right dish as it does not seem to be as i have it at all the thai places. The waitress was offended by this and said she would not charge me for this and in a haste took that plate and went to the kitchen. She did not return back and was not paying attention to us. Finally when i called she come backs, My wife tries to order Mango with sticky rice for which she says ' Do you know this dish. I think you will not like this dish and stared saying some bullshit and said she will not take any orders and gets the bill and put it on the table'. I was so mad and got up and went up to the register to pay the bill. I was trying to talk to the waitress and she would not listen and was saying that i hurt the people of Thailand. The owner at the register asked us not to come to the restaurant which we would not anyway after all this bullshit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh! All the food I have ordered so far was delicious and the waiters here are so cute and friendly! I normally order the warm and refreshing Thai Me Up noodle but I tried the Thai grilled chicken today and it tasted awesome! This place definitely is a 5-star restaurant."}
{"text":"I would usually give Thai Me Up 5 stars, but the past few times I've gone for lunch the service has been horrible and the food has been cold, even the soup. I used to love this place! The food and service used to be fantastic! Today my experience was quite different. The waitress actually yelled at me for asking for hot sauce. (Mind you that I had ordered a number 10 spicy and there was no spice at all.) She spent 5 minutes yelling that I was taking up too much of her time and that she was too busy to deal with my table of one. Had she not been yelling she could have been doing the work she said she needed to be doing. When I went to pay my bill I let her know that she had offended me and that I didn't understand her anger towards me. I also explained that it was not my fault that she was the only waitress. I honestly wasn't trying to be a pain in the ass... She had no response and had no apologies. Regardless of how much I love their Thai Style Fried Rice I don't think I'll be returning for lunch or dinner again anytime soon due to their nasty wait staff."}
{"text":"Ok  so I am NOT a fan of asian food and definately NOT a fan of super spicy.  That said...I really liked Tai Me up.   I had the Tai me Up noodles, Steamed dumpling and chicken wontons.   All three were deliscious!  The dumplings had a tasty meat filling with a nice herb flavor (basil?)  Won tons were hot, the filling was great too.   I drank every drop of the broth and ate every noodle.  

Thge service was fast and friendly in a small attractive setting.

I can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Thai me up?  That's the only way you'll get me back there.  

Let me get the redeeming qualities out of the way first.  It'll be quick. 
- very fast service.. But so fast that I'm pretty sure everything is sitting in hot pans in the back until someone orders it
- nice people
- cheap .. but for good reason.

Moving on.  

If you have any level of sophistication in taste for Thai food (or any Asian food), just stay away.  This \"Thai\" food is pretty much on par with the asian place in the mall food court.  Maybe a little worse.   I think I would probably even prefer asian food from the freezer aisle at the grocery store.  If you want Thai food, there are plenty of great options in the city.  Give your business to Pusadee's Garden, Smiling Banana Leaf or Thai Suan Thip.  You'll get something much better than low quality chicken and vegetables drowned in mystery sauce (that I'm pretty sure is 80% oil).  

I hate to be so tough, but it was extremely annoying to get such a sub-par meal after hearing good things about this place.  Don't get me wrong, if you don't know anything about Asian food, you probably won't think it's too bad.  But if you know good Asian food, then definitely skip this place.  Don't say no one warned you!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  The food was delicious!  Everything was fresh and homemade.  I had the crab rangoons and pad Thai and I'd highly recommend both.  Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the other Thai places in town enough to do a comparison, but I loved eating here when I lived on the South Side. The lunch specials are insanely cheap, like $7 for a huge dish and spring roll. They will steam your tofu instead of frying it on request. The portions are big and the service is lightning fast. 

It's very cozy and a great place to people watch on Carson Street."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thai Me Up at least half a dozen times before today and always found it to be a solid Thai restaurant - a consistent three to four stars. The food we received today however was way below the quality that I've come to expect at Thai Me Up and other Thai restaurants. 

I usually find it to be a bad sign when a Thai restaurant finds a way to mess up Pad Thai, but this is what happened. The dish was colorless, served with no garnish and the flavor was bland.

The service was wonderful though, our water glasses were consistently refilled and our food was served within minutes of ordering (which, looking back, should have been a red flag). All of the wait staff we interacted was very friendly as well. But the food was an overall disappointment."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! My colleagues and I come here for lunch a lot. The food is amazing and they are so good at getting it to you quickly. The staff is so friendly too! I love the red curry and the spring rolls"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick Thai BYOB fix. I have personally not had the best experience with the Pad Thai, but I definitely recommend the Sriracha Fried Rice because you know...  Siracha. Wonton tacos are a good appetizer but eat them fast or they get rather soggy.

Lemongrass and Coconut Galangal soup are great for a cold day. 

I tend to think it is a little overpriced for the quality but overall it's a tasty place for your mouth region."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with a really great atmosphere with the large garage doors and somewhat rustic feel. I went for lunch, and the portions weren't what I was expecting-- they were the perfect size for my stomach, though for the amount I was paying, I was expecting a little more. The food was okay, but it was the place and the people that made a better impression for me."}
{"text":"Thai Me Up is my most revered and favorite eatery to go to. I've taken many friends here and they have fallen in love with it in the same way. Located in an upcycled garage in the South Side, the atmosphere is creative and colorful, with super nice people running the place. I would believe I am considered a regular, and I am always greeted with a very warm hello and they are familiar with my usual order. It's always nice to have a jovial talk your waiter in such a casual place. The environment is always good-vibes, and they even open the garage door for refreshing air when it's nice out. I usually always order the green curry - spiciest level - because it is so darn good! Absolutely one of my favorite dishes ever. I recently tried their seasonal special, pumpkin curry, and I must say it was insanely rad! Creamy, spiced and salted with Thai flavors, and a bit sweet with the pumpkin. I'm a sucker for curries. Many of my friends who I have taken to Thai Me Up order the pineapple fried rice - a dish I have never tried, but is an absolute favorite among my friends. The Thai Iced coffee is delicious - be careful, you might drink it too fast it's so good! I also ordered the mango and sweet rice once which was very fun for a sweet snack - delicious; perfect for anyone who loves mangoes. The Z noodles and Pad Thai are very good as well. I definitely recommend the curries - I can't get enough of them! Thai Me Up will forever be a favorite. Thank you so much to all the kind souls running such a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been having on-and-off Thai Tuesdays from Thai Me Up for five years. Good thing is - they are pretty consistent in flavors and serving size. 

The pad thai, basil noodles, green chicken curry, and thai fried rice are my favorites. Definitely not your authentic thai, but it is still very tasty. the crab rangoons are a great extra something if you are looking for an appetizer too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Nicky's will always be my favorite Thai in Pittsburgh, both locations equally great, but Thai Me Up is all of a 5 minute drive from my house on the Southside, and I love both dining in (cool atmosphere,) or take out, which I personally do more often. 

When I have dined in, they have had issues with being understaffed, one server clearly overwhelmed with an unusually busy Tuesday night, but as for the food, I've tried many dishes and they are delicious.

Standouts, their steamed dumplings are my favorite appetizer, done so well. their lemongrass soup with mushrooms is fantastic (lots of shrooms,) and if you ask for it to be spicy, spicy you will receive. 

As for entrees, some of my favorites are the Spicy Sweet and Sour, with chicken and Tofu, both proteins are always prepared perfectly, and the S&S sauce is great... Eggplant and Basil with spicy ginger sauce, and the old Thai stand by, Pad Thai is certainly on par with Nicky's."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I love all the flavors they use such as lemon zest, mint and peanut.  Prices are really reasonable too and I love that it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. Went to grab lunch to go, I live 10 minutes away and the pad Thai I ordered was cold and a solid mass of noodles that smelled and tasted ONLY like fish sauce. Also ordered some tofu and rice with peanut sauce that was cold and couldn't even cut the tofu. Both were thrown promptly into the garbage. The spring rolls were ok, hence the 2 star rating (the hostess was nice too). I've eaten here before and I don't remember it being so awful, but won't be ordering food here again."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average. Not bad quality but not exactly the kind of place I would be dying to come back to. 
I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night and it was literally empty except for 1 other table. The restaurant decor is so cute and has a very romantic atmosphere. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere with just a laundromat and residential houses surrounding it. 
We ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer based on other yelp suggestions and it was pretty good but you could taste the 70/30 cream cheese to crab filling ratio. For the main course I got the spicy basil noodles with chicken also based on other Yelp reviews which I would give 1/10 stars. It was very plain and dry overall--the chicken, noodles, and bok Choy. I didn't taste any basil and it wasn't spicy at all.  My boyfriend got the red curry which was actually pretty good so I ended up just mixing my meal with the red curry sauce which gave it a lot more flavor. 
It was still a very cute place and the service was fast and friendly but if you come here go for the curries over the noodles."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to this wonderful establishment, each time with my fiancé. We love the very reasonable prices, and the off Carson atmosphere. The lemongrass and wonton soups are to die for. The pad Thai is very good. On my last visit I had zu noodles which were excellent, and my bride to be had the basil eggplant. Her dish was incredible. The eggplant was cooked to perfection and with the basil flavor as a wonderful complement on your pallet, I already decided on what I'm getting next time. Its BYOB, so you definitely will save money if you like a glass of wine or a cold brew with dinner. Most of all why I love this place, is what other top 25 restaurant in Pittsburgh can a couple go to and each of you get a soup and entree and only spend $30! I highly recommend this joint"}
{"text":"I got VIOLENTLY ill from this restaraunt.  The food is terrible.  I went there on a date, his idea not mine, and we both got so sick off our food we had to leave!  I don't recommend it to anyone.  It's not even good thai food.  So.. it's got a cute funny name.  That doesn't make the food any better."}
{"text":"I love THAI ME UP! I've been a fan for years!! Everything is delicious and the people who work there are absolutely great! They make every dish to your liking. I started ordering the Spicy Fried rice and now I order Pineapple Curry from them like once a week! Love love love!!"}
{"text":"Despite the horrible name, I thought I'd give this place a chance. Wanting some comfort food and being stuck on the South Side, I had my mind set on some spicy basil noodles which are just as basic to make as pad thai. It's the other Thai dish that's really hard to mess up. Or so I thought.

After being seated and served water by a really weird waiter I waited for him to come back and take my order. Although I was one of two occupied tables in the place, it took him a while to get back to me. When my food came out it looked alright, despite missing the aforementioned basil. In fact, I found only a few shreds of basil amongst the very watery and bland sauce. The only thing I could taste was salt. No delicious chilis, no fresh veggies, no hearty noodles. It was like eating coagulated salt water. Gross. The only saving grace is that the chicken was definitely real, white meat chicken.

I would highly recommend skipping this place unless you are literally starving and can't walk another inch down Carson St."}
{"text":"the portions are very small so if your hungry order 2 dinner meals. also very little meat in the dishes. overall it tasted well and great service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service.

Highly recommend their Thai Me Up rolls, spring rolls and their Chicken Won-ton's as an appetizer.  Love the dipping sauce, as well.

The spicy basil noodles are phenomenal, and the curries are wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Finding a moderately priced BYOB in the burgh was quite the task! In Philly BYOBs are everywhere!! (They even have an interactive BYOB map with closest Liquor Stores listed.) 

Admittedly, I chose this place because of the prices and the BYOB option (corkage fees are a pain, this was a $3 charge per bottle of wine). 

Like most BYOBs, this restaurant was small with maybe 7 tables.  The server politely told us the kitchen closed in 15 minutes (it was only 8:00pm, damn.) 

I started off with the mushroom lemongrass soup, I wasn't a big fan but I tried something new and sometimes it doesn't always work out. I ate about half of the soup then my Spicy Shrimp Salad arrived.  The salad was great! The dressing was a spicy ginger concoction with about 6 pieces of shrimp intermingled. Yum!

My friend got a Pineapple Curry which wasn't spicy at all (she ordered a 9 on the spicy scale) and almost bland.  My other friends got Spicy Fried Rice, Chicken Satay and Chicken Curry which they all enjoyed! 

Pros: CHEAP, BYOB, convenient location on carson, accept credit cards (so many byobs are cash only), CHEAP, decent food

Cons: closes early, corkage fee, spicy things aren't that spicy

Overall: Check it out if you want a byob with cheap food! If you are going out in Southside BYOBs are a great pre-game option haha...but seriously."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant greeted me with French songs, how romantically irrelevant. Maybe they're going for a more \"date night\" feel. With such a humorously kinky name, it's a shame that the restaurant is tucked away towards the inner streets of Southside, instead of along the main Carson stretch. If it wasn't for Yelp, I don't think I'll ever discover this place. The restaurant is clean and bright with good service. 

 As for food, I thought it was pretty average. I ordered the Pineapple Curry Bowl, which is more on the sweeter side of the curry spectrum. It was creamy, soupy and slightly tangy. For a curry bowl, I was not satisfied with the spice level. Kind of disappointed that the waitress did not give me the option to alter that. My eating companions ordered two different noodle dishes, but they both ended up tasting exactly the same, just different noodles. The food took forever to come out, but ended up a bit too cold for my liking. I like my food steamy if I have to wait that long. Portions are average and can easily be finished in one sitting. Prices are double digits $$, but not too bad. I think it's a great place for a date night if you bring your own booze. 

Overall, I thought the food at Thai Me Up was just okay, not the best ever. I feel like it's more of a fusion restaurant so I would recommend this place to my fellow foodies who are a bit more shy. If you're adventurous with thrill seeking taste buds, I don't think this place will satisfy that wild side."}
{"text":"I was hesitant, as I don't like most of the Thai in Pittsburgh, but I was pleased. Som tum on the menu, automatic Thai cred. The rolls were good, better than my curry, and the som tum was good. I liked the menu. There were classics and also some creative dishes. I will definitely try again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each time the food is consistently great! My favorite meal was the Pad Thai, it had excellent flavoring and had the perfect amount of heat level. The Cashew Nut is also very good, nothing special as far as taste, so I highly recommend getting the Pad Thai. First time I came here it was just 2 of us and we were given excellent service. We sat right away, they took or orders in a timely manner and brought our food out quickly. When I came here with a large group of 8 people, while the staff was still friendly, they seemed unorganized. We asked to be seated 2 times (there were plenty of open tables) before finally being sat and they forgot to put one of our orders in, so my friend had to wait longer to get her food. Thankfully, they offered to split our check by meal if we brought the receipt up front, which we found very helpful. Overall, I  enjoyed coming here to eat and my meal was great, it was just slightly disorganized."}
{"text":"Best sushi! Just around the corner from our apartment and always a treat! Only 4 stars because a bit pricey for us, but we splurge when we can! Friendly staff and great food, what could be better?! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a comfort food thing for me. Things are surprisingly consistent across visits. The staff is attentive and welcoming. The food is made from actual cut up food and not so much from a frozen bag of cut up food. It's great for lunch, it's a good quick dinner. I like this place so much that I've been known to go eat dinner there by myself, and I don't feel weird about it."}
{"text":"Food has that faint taste of dirty dishwater."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and atmosphere there. Very small and very laid back. They also have a big takeout business. I had the green curry and asked for medium spice level, it was exactly what I was looking for. No surprises and delicious. The portion sizes were great too. I hate when I go to a restaurant and they give you 8 pounds of food and you leave feeling ridiculously full. I finished the plate and was comfortably full. My roommate had the z u noodles, and they were really good too. They were wide noodles, almost like a papperdelle and they held the sauce perfectly. It was a welcome departure from the noisy bar/restaurant atmosphere in most southside restaurants. The only thing I'd change would be the sake I brought with me. Corking fee is only $3 too for wine. Beer is $1 per bottle."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has 3.5 stars?! It was great! My mom actually suggested to go here and sometimes she's not the greatest at picking out places but she wanted to try it, so we did. 

It's on one of the side streets of South Side which, I think, offers better parking. Or at least parking where you don't have to walk far. The inside is really cute and seemed pretty clean. The moment you walk in, you're greeted with smiling faces and that's something I find makes the dining experience a lot better. All of their employees were really friendly and attentive. Our drinks were always full and they checked on us the right amount of times. 

We ordered the chef recommended Thai Spice Sausages. It was excellent. Definitely really spicy but very tasty. I would've gotten two ordered had I known how tasty it was! Probably my favorite thing we had. However, if you can't take spicy, do not order this dish. 

My mom ordered the Basil Eggplant dish that came with sticky rice and I ordered the chef's recommended Nam Tok which was grilled short rib chuck with shallots, cilantro, mint and roasted rice. Both dishes were full of flavor. You could taste every single spice on my dish. I loved the roasted rice, as well. It went so well with the sauce for mine and was different than your normal sticky rice.  And whatever sauce was in the eggplant dish was delicious!

The only \"negative\" thing I could say is that I wish there was more on my plate. They covered the rest of my plate with some kind of salad greens that I didn't even eat. But the eggplant dish was a big portion. We also brought take home for my dad and he loved it, which is a hard palette to please. 

I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The service is a little slow, but they are super friendly and accommodating. I called to make reservations, but they do not take them. Instead, they suggested I call about 15 minutes before arriving to let them know we are on our way and they would try to have a table ready. That worked out really well. We were seated within 30 seconds of arriving. 

But for the most important part - THE FOOD IS SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place shortly after I moved to Pittsburgh. As if the name isn't reason enough to go here (they have merchandise!), they have great tasting food, huge portions, and everything is under $10.

Having found myself on the South Side many times, I can say that it's easy to walk right by this place. Very tiny restaurant, and not a lot of signage from what I can remember. But keep an eye out for it, it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Be warned, this is the second time I've had thai me up and its just okay. The food is not spicy at all and I ordered an 8. In addition, the food is overly priced. With so many places to eat nearby, spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant (and in my general top 10) on the planet. The Spicy Basil Noodles are to die for. When I'm back in the 412, I eat here twice a week.

It's very cozy inside, and while there could be table cloths and more stuff on the walls, I never mind. You can't find a better cooked Thai meal, and amazingly enough for that trait, a cheaper one. 

I crave this stuff often."}
{"text":"Slightly better food since they relocated to the current location. They were prior, in the space where La Palapa is, now.
The interior is cool funky. They had some New Orleans-y music playing.
There are lunch specials that consist of a main dish & lemongrass soup for $8 .
The soup was decent/good. Not on the level of Nicky's or My Thai or Thai Spoon(the 3 best Thai joints in Pgh. area, imo.)
The pad thai chicken was rather lackluster with no peanuts, very little spice heat when I asked for \"Thai hot\" spice level. It was too sugary sweet, as well. Not enough sweet/sour/savory balance as proper pad thai should be. I will go back and try the cashew beef & other dishes but to me, Thai Me Up is a mediocre Thai eatery that doesn't seem interested in competing with the aforementioned better quality Thai joints because I think, being in a College off-campus housing area for the most part, they get a lot of 20 somethings that don't know any better."}
{"text":"Tried it based on the reviews before me and I was not disappointed.  The food was simply delicious.

I would go back without have any reservations.  

The place was BYOB as far as I could tell and the clientele was thoroughly enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last night for my husband 's bday. Especially the coconut soup and Thai me up fries... Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Mmm, thai food. Love it.  As far as awesome thai food goes, I give this place 3 stars because it was truly \"A-OK.\"  Good prices, nice selection, okay food.  

I ordered the Thai Me Up Rolls, as I can NEVER turn down a fresh spring roll.  They were fine, but this is no Tram's Kitchen (best.ever.).  I also ordered the Salmon Salad; a bed of iceberg topped with a few pieces of slightly overdone salmon.  My crew of seven ordered a variety of soups, pad thai and fried rices.  All seemed a-ok.

The atmosphere is lovely and it's BYOB (with a few corkage charges, etc - no biggie).  Reservations are pretty necessary; at least for a Saturday night.  I recommend trying it out. It's cheap enough that if you're not totally in love with the place, you haven't lost much.  Plus - it's a nice, healthy option before you go gorge yourself on beer (and eventually Southside Steaks) on the glorious Southside :-)"}
{"text":"Hands down best thai I've ever had and great service!  Spicy basil noodles and the spicy chicken rice are the best!"}
{"text":"It's pretty average Thai. Because my boyfriend lives so close, the atmosphere is cute, and the restaurant is BYO, I want to love it more than I do. Each entree we've ordered has been...okay. We've had Z U noodles, pineapple fried rice, and pad thai. The one thing I may try out is the rad na... if we go back. I find myself comparing it to my Holy Trinity of Pittsburgh Thai (Nicky's, Noodlehead, and SBL) and in my opinion the dishes just never even come close. Thai Me Up doesn't seem to have the flavor and sometimes the dishes come out pretty dry.

Couple this with the really rushed service, and to me it's just not worth it. *Sigh* the quest for amazing Thai in the Southside continues!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever eaten Thai food and it was great.  The waiter was very friendly and answered all of our questions.  He also made sure we ordered with the amount of spicy we desired.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! This place turned me on to Thai food and I haven't looked back!! I've used their catering for events and often do take-out for Friday nights in. 

My favorites are the spicy basil noodles, chicken pad thai, and pineapple fried rice. I like mine extra spicy so I usually do a level 7 with a side of the chilli paste for added kick. The new(ish) location is a block off of Carson street, but it makes for a better atmosphere. 

I suggest this to all who are coming to the southside!"}
{"text":"First of all, Thai Me Up? The name alone is awesome. 

I had some dish with eggplant in it. Although the eggplant version was a little extra, it was delicious.

The place is a little small and outdated. People coming in had to wait to be seated, yet there wasn't much room for them. Kind of expected on the South Side though."}
{"text":"This place is located close to me and not being in the mood to cook take out it was. Now let me clarify I get Thai probably twice a year so I don't try it from various places monthly but my review I feel will stick close to my past experiences with Thai establishments.

I went with the spicy basil noodles which were ok but far from spicy. I would put them around 2 out of 10 spicy wise. The beef was good and all around it was an A-OK dish but left me wanting some more kick behind it and flavor. That rush of spice and warmness from a hot Thai dish you normally get.

We decided to do a side of rice which was ok but the place would not allow us to get a side of beef to go with it. I understand rules are rules but I found it kind of odd they couldn't just throw in a little container like most establishments a container of beef to eat with the rice. I don't really want to ding them on the review but honestly I mean on a take out level let's leave this up to the future visitors to think it's ok or not ok to deny a side of beef with a side of rice.

The location is easy to find there is some public parking a block down and street parking is possible. The interior is cozy inside and customer service was fine I can't say anything but positive in this aspect just in the future I will try a few other places in the city to see how they stack up against Thai Me Up with food taste wise and that damn side of beef lol.

3 out of 5 all day long nothing less nothing more."}
{"text":"I've been searching for good Pad Thai at a reasonable price in Pittsburgh and after the 5th place I was starting to lose hope, but then I found Thai Me Up! The ambiance in the place was rustic and the staff were very friendly. We started with the crab rangoons which were hot and tasty. As I said, I got the Pad Thai which had just he right amount of peanut taste and spicy kick, and was a good portion size. My date got the spicy fried rice, which she said she thoroughly enjoyed. I only wish they were also open on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Sorry Thai Cuisine, but Thai Me Up just gave you the boot as my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  My dinner at Thai Me up was some of the best Thai food I have ever had (and I eat lots of Thai food in cities all around the country), the service is fantastic, and the environment really relaxing and fun.  

Their menu has plenty of standards, but also some food I have never seen elsewhere.  I had an eggplant salad with chicken tomatoes and hardboiled eggs.  It sounds like an odd combo but tasted like heaven.  It might be my new craving food.  I ordered Z-U noodles, which is the same as pad see ew.  It was the best I have ever had.  It was saucy instead of dry, and the sauce was so incredibly flavorful.  Huge portions too and a really great price.

Usually I'm not the type who gets caught up in the decor of a place; I care mostly about the food.  But it is always a plus when an affordable place steps up the decor and can make a date night feel that is easy on the wallet.  The lighting in this places is great.  I'd have the owner come decorate my house if I could."}
{"text":"Great little secret find in the southside. I like this place much better than Nickys thai kitchen, which happens to be the gold standard in pittsburgh. The food is always deliscious, and the one time I did have a problem with the food not being spicy enough the owner was extremely helpful. He suggested that when I order I say that I want a 9 thai style because they make it american due to too many people complaining. The tofu red curry is my go to, and the spring rolls with peanut sauce are to die for! BYOB!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been going to this place for a long time. It is hands down our favorite thai in Pittsburgh! I think it has a lot to do with their spicy basil noodles... Which is the best thai dish I have ever had! We may even try to have it at our wedding! :)"}
{"text":"I'd like to think I have some cred when it comes to Thai food. I've had it all over the country, and I'd pretty much have it for every meal if that were possible. Or bathe in drunken noodles every night...

I will start by saying there is nothing wrong with the service here. Our waitress was very attentive and prompt. And after we let the owner know how dissatisfied we were, she gave a us a full refund.

But consider yourself warned - the food is a GIGANTIC rip off and an extreme disappointment. I cannot stress this enough.

If you like spicy, then you'd better order a LVL 10 to get what is equivalent to a LVL 3. Also there were absolutely no garnishes or vegetables in the Pad Thai whatsoever - no peanuts, limes, bean sprouts, egg, green onions - nothing. Just wet, under-spiced, over-sweet noodles and tofu for $11 dollars. Luckily (because I always ask for extra vegetables) I got a *few* in my Pad Kee Mao. We didn't even finish our food because we were so disappointed. $25 for noodles with practically no flavor or spice.

Skip this place and to Nicky's Thai on Penn. Or go get the $3 Pad Thai from the cart in the strip. Both light years better than Thai Me Up."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pad Thai, and Pineapple Fried Rice. 
Their pineapple fried rice is like nothing I've ever tasted, all other Thai restaurants' just don't add up to this one. 
Also, their Pad Thai has a unique and different taste from other restaurants that we enjoy"}
{"text":"Has Thai Me Up gone downhill? I've been to TMU a few times over the last couple years and I always thought that for the price, the food was very good. My last trip to TMU, I was not as impressed.  We called and made reservations for a Thursday night. A friend of mine arrived first and ordered the TMU rolls. When the rest of our party arrived, we waited over 15 minutes for the server to come over to the table and take our order. My friend also still didn't receive his rolls. We ended up ordering a few more appetizers and they all came out together. The appetizers were fine, (satay chicken, dumplings) no complaints there. However, I was not impressed with my dinner. Feeling adventurous, (I usually stick to a rice dish with chicken) I decided to try the Pho. When our entrees arrived, my Pho was presented in a bowl with a large amount of broth. It wasn't very pleasing to the eye as the broth was clear and the noodles and sprouts were white. My biggest criticism though is the amount of beef in the Pho. I would expect to see only a few bites of beef if this were an appetizer but not an entree. The dish was mainly vermicelli and sprouts which would have been much better if the broth it was in had more flavor. I could not taste the garlic or the beef in the broth. Well, I couldn't taste much of anything in the broth. I added some sweet chili paste to spice it up a notch but even with the paste the flavor was very one dimensional. My dinning companions were equally unimpressed with their meals with the exception of the chicken pineapple which had large chunks of chicken and great flavors. If I do go back to TMU, I will know not to stray from my standard chicken and rice dishes."}
{"text":"I've come to the conclusion that Thai Me Up is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has a lot of Thai restaurants & most of them are very good but Thai Me Up I think is the best. They always deliver; excellent food no matter what you order, reasonable prices, great service & atmosphere. 
My favorite are the wonton tacos appetizer. Delicious tilapia in fresh crispy house made taco shells with cilantro & a little bit of sriracha sauce. Amazing!! I wish they made them a little bigger as an entree. I could eat those as my whole meal. 
The vegetable spring rolls are also delicious. Crispy but not greasy & comes with a semi-sweet dipping sauce. 
I've had quite a few of the noodle & rice dishes, all are very good! My favorite entree is the pineapple fried rice with vegetables. Absolutely delicious!! Love the combination of the pineapple with the cashews. Also just the right amount of sauce, they never over do it. 
I highly recommend Thai Me Up! They won't disappoint. And make sure you try the wonton tacos!! :)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, convenient location, but better Thai can be found in the city. I find food to be average at best. We ordered Crab Rangoons, Spring Rolls, Spicy Basil Mung Bean Noodles with Tofu, and  Five Spice beef Noodles. Due to great atmosphere and BYO, it is an easy place to pick, but I felt disappointed after last visit. We were also rushed through our entire meal. Sat down at 8:15P with restaurant closing at 9:00P and they made it very clear they wanted us out as fast as possible. Did not make for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I have Thai Me Up almost once a week. I usually order take out for lunch and the big debate between the spicy basil noodles and the z-u noodles. Both are delicious and for lunch it is nice that the menu is smaller (makes the decision a little easier!). The staff is always very friendly! The level of spiciness is usually on point with what you order, but sometimes a 6 can be pretty hot for me! But the food is still delicious. It is BYOB which is really nice!  I would recommend this place to anyone! I have never had a bad meal there. Portions are good and the price is just right! The decor is really nice! 

You can't go wrong with the spicy basil noodles!"}
{"text":"I went to Thai Me Up on Friday night around 9 PM. I love the atmosphere and the fact that it is BYOB is amazing. The service was quick and we ordered a Spring Roll to start, however, I felt VERY rushed by the waiter. He kept asking if we were ready to order our entrée and I told him that we'd like to enjoy a glass of wine and the appetizer and order in a few minutes.

After we ordered our food, we immediately felt rushed through dinner. They started flipping chairs on all of the tables next to us, turned the lights on and it was only 9:30 PM! We were going out afterwards so we didn't want to take a half of bottle of wine with us, so we felt rushed through the whole dinner. I understand not letting any more customers in, but PLEASE allow the customers that are in there to enjoy their meal on a Friday night. It was only 9:30!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service and great environment. Our waitress was very friendly  and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and although the food here is wonderful, the service is poor. They do not have enough wait staff to take care of all the tables. On one occasion, the food was delicious and the service was OK until it was time to ask for the check. The waiter seemed to be avoiding my eye contact and ignored me flailing my hands around for his attention. My friend had to walk up to the counter and demand the check after the waiter ignored us for 10+ minutes. After we handed over our cards, he took forever to bring the check and cards back. We were trying to get to a movie at Southside Works after dinner and we ended up being more than 20 minutes late, not including previews, because it took 30 minutes to pay our bill! So ridiculous and disappointing after we had been totally satisfied with the food. The food is great, the decor is cute, and the atmosphere is cozy, but the service is such a huge issue that I am not sure I'll ever make a fourth trip back."}
{"text":"This review is partially based upon expectations.  It's not that the food was bad or that I had a bad experience, but I have a friend that raves about how this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh and I was a little disappointed having heard that for years and it just not living up to my expectations.  

The restaurant is very small and the decor is very minimal.  It's BYOB and I, of course, did not come prepared so my wine craving had to wait.  I ordered the Chicken Basil Leaves and did really enjoy it.  I'm a basil lover but for whatever reason have always steered away from a basil sauce in a Thai restaurant.   No longer.  I need to order this more often."}
{"text":"We've been going there for many years and have followed them to their new home. Never had a bad meal. Far and away the best Thai food in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I usually stick with the same spots. Why fix it if it's broken, right? For dinner last night, we finally decided to try somewhere different. 

I live nearby and have walked by numerous times. It is normally busy but we were the only diners in for dinner at first. I ordered the pineapple curry chicken with a spice level of 5. My bf ordered pad thai noodles with chicken. We also ordered Thai ice tea after reading reviews about it.

I personally found the curry dish way too sweet, same with the Thai tea. My bf's Thai fried rice was lacking on the chicken. Also our food came out within 5 minutes which was awkward. 

Anyways, i wasnt really satisfied with this meal, especially for the total coming to almost $40.

Service was friendly so i'll bump it up to 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is so good and so infuriating. 

The food is just... it's SO good.  Get the panang curry and add crushed peanuts.  The crab rangoon is fantastic, as well.

WHY DON'T THEY DELIVER?!  Don't they know I'm lazy and not wearing pants?!

AND WHEN ARE THEY OPEN?!?!?!  I swear this place is only open from like 4:00 am - 10:00 am on the second Tuesday of every February in the year of the tiger only cause half the time I call them they are closed.

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, THAI ME UP!  BE EASIER TO ACCESS!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and so when I was in Pitt, I got on Yelp to find a Thai restaurant in the South Side, and found this place.  Of course, I was intrigued by the name alone!  I went here for lunch with a friend who lives in town but had not been.  I took the advice a previous reviewer and ordered the Spicy Basil Noodles with my lunch special -- which, I might add, is a total steal: soup or spring roll and entree for under $8.  I was somewhat disappointed given the high expectations from the review.  I found the basil flavors lacking, and thought the dish was generally too greasy, the kind of greasy I expect from your neighborhood Chinese take-out place.  I tried my friends' Pad Thai though and it was definitely very good.  I've had better, but for the price, this place is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and went to Thai Me Up with a large group of friends. When we saw how tiny the restaurant was, I didn't know if the one waitress would be able to take care of my group & the rest of the customers at the same time. But she was awesome! All of the food came out quickly and was super delicious. I got the Thai Me Up rolls (summer rolls with tofu and basil) & the steamed dumplings. Everything was super fresh and really decently priced."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly, because I live in South Side and love Thai food.

As far as food goes, I tend to get the Pad Thai with Tofu, extra spicy. I specifically note that I want the dish to be a 10/10 spicy, or \"Thai hot,\" and they follow through and deliver really solid, spicy Thai noodles. They even sell their spice at the register. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but it seems different than other Thai restaurants (I regularly also have gone to Pusadee's Garden and Nicky's Thai Kitchen in Pittsburgh, and Thai Me Up has better spice). Something about this spice really leaves the dish with the right amount of zesty spice. 

Occasionally the Pad Thai is a little oily or sauce-heavy, but the vast majority of the time, it's really tasty and done just right. 

As far as ambience and convenience goes, I wish that they had Wi-Fi, as I tend to come here for lunch. It's also a much better lunch place than a date or dinner place. It's a little too casual, IMO. 

Definitely a fan though!"}
{"text":"I've visited Thai Me Up on three separate occasions now, and the prompt, friendly service is the only thing keeping my review above two stars. The first two times were \"meh.\" Both the satay chicken and enoki mushroom appetizers were unmemorable, as were my first two dishes.

During the most recent visit, my boyfriend ordered the Z-U noodles - they ran out of the noodles for that dish and they had to be substituted. Okay, no problem, I understand restaurants run out of things. But then my Pad Thai came out (I wish I would have read all of the poor reviews about the Pad Thai before ordering), but I could not have anticipated it to be so terrible. I took two bites and was finished. It was a giant lump of overly sweet noodles with a few pieces of rubbery, flavorless chicken mixed in. I wish I was exaggerating. I ended up paying for it, taking it home and throwing it away because I didn't have the heart to tell our (very sweet) waitress that I had no interest in taking another bite.

With so many other options in the South Side, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved the food especially the curry. Wait staff great! I had pumpkin curry and fresh rolls and they were a1"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. First off, they don't have AC or at least they're not using it. Now Pittsburgh gets balmy in spring and summer and I like my thai food spicy, AC is crucial. The food is okay, they have some chinese dishes and mediocre thai. The place itself is pretty small and showing wear and age."}
{"text":"I never had Thai food before so I don't have anything to compare it to but the food here is awesome. The Wonton Taco's are delicious. I get the ZU noodles with beef or pork and I love it!  My husband always gets the Spicy Fried Rice but he tried the Siracha Fried Rice last night and he absolutely loved it! There is enough food to take some home for lunch the next day so it may seem a little costly but it's worth it!  Very nice wait staff and it is BYOB. They close the kitchen by 9pm (not typical for a SouthSide Restaurant) so make sure you get in before that. The new location is much larger than the old place on Carson Street and they have roll up garage doors that makes it very nice when the weather is, well...good or bad; they can have open air dining (or not)."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  I don't get to go often enough!!!

PROS:  
Very good food
Generous portions
Friendly staff
Intimate atmosphere/Quaint

CONS:  
They dont give you a knife!  LOL
um... that's the only CON!

Really great food at reasonable prices with friendly staff.
I *HIGHLY* recommend the \"Z U Noodles\" with Chicken; its a very tasty brown sauce over wide rice noodles with chicken and broccoli--my Fave!

Open for lunch and dinner and right off of 22nd & Carson.
Take-out is available (and used often--very busy @ lunch time w/take-out)"}
{"text":"I live nearby but never knew about this place before, that was my first time visit, had coconut milk soup and tofu appetizer plate. Soup was very good and tofu was enormous size - liked everything a lot! Also I had coconut ice cream with sweet rice for desert - delicious! Very good and friendly service. Nice people :) Also after the food you can go check the store with Thai food with democratic prices(located next door). I liked this restaurant a lot and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured here last week while we were visiting family in Pittsburgh. To start off, the location was convenient, and I liked how it was tucked away off the main drag. The staff were friendly and prompt for the most part, and I could tell that this is a place mostly frequented of locals. We ordered the Thai chicken wings and two meals. The wings were a bit greasy and did not compare to a place that serves them here in Tampa stuffed with seasonings and water chestnuts - delicious. The taste of our meals was decent, but I was a little bit disappointed in the portion size. Overall, eating here was a positive experience, but I would be open to other options for Thai in the area."}
{"text":"Stoped in for lunch. The service was good. Nice ambiance. Had the basil noodle lunch special w lemongrass soup and an egg roll. It was all great. The lemongrass soup was outstanding. I would certainly give it a try if close. ."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here tonight and was not impressed. I had the pad thai (a dish I often use as a reference point when comparing Thai restaurants). I think this was the worst pad thai I've had in the past five years. It was very bland. It lacked the texture and flavor spark that I've experienced at Thai restaurants in San Francisco or Berkeley, CA. Even in Pittsburgh, you can get better pad thai at Noodlehead, Bangkok Balcony, or Silk Elephant, for example. My friend's entree, eggplant with basil, was better (3 stars).

Contrary to some other information I'm seeing here on Yelp, Thai Me Up takes reservations. At least they did for our party of 5 on a Thursday. (On the phone they told me they don't take reservations for Fridays or Saturdays, however).

Service was slow. After we finished eating, it was 20 minutes before the waiter came to ask if we were ready for the check."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years, and am always happy with the food.  The crab rangoons are my favorite of anywhere else, and the sauce they serve with them is also delicious.

I have been getting the chicken pad thai since my first trip (how lame, I know).  It is just so good that I can't make myself try anything else.  I also enjoy the lemon grass soup, definitely warms ya up."}
{"text":"Always flavorful food with very prompt service! I enjoyed the Thai Me Up fries, Thai style wontons and spicy chicken wings. Along with an entrée of pineapple fried rice with chicken. 

On my most recent visit, the staff helped to heat up a small packet of mac & cheese we brought for my niece which went above and beyond our expectations. We LOVE Thai Me Up!"}
{"text":"Parking is tough. Otherwise loving it!"}
{"text":"Good food but a little stingy with portions compared to other Thai places that I go to.  Best to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with incredible service. I was highly pleased with the restaurant all around (the cleanliness,  the staff, how quickly the good came out, how fresh it was etc!). I will certainly dine here again soon."}
{"text":"Thai Me Up is hands down my favorite place to eat in the city... I love the Thai Iced Tea, Thai Me Up Rolls and the Spicy Basil Mung Bean Noodles... And the waitress is always so great!"}
{"text":"YAY!  Made a return trip since my first experience was just so good.  Was really hoping that my first experience was not idiosyncratic.  

Wonton soup
Steamed dumplings with tamarind sauce
Thai-me-up wings
Basil leaves with beef {piquancy 6/10}
Green curry with beef {piquancy 8/10}
Spicy fried rice with chicken

I must say, I still enjoyed the wonton soup.  It still had the aromatic notes about it and I enjoyed the flavor.  The steamed dumplings were much better this time; in fact, I rather enjoyed them.  They were no longer rubbery and everything that was so out of balance the first time was finally in balance -- even with the tamarind sauce.

I upped my entree to an 8/10 on the piquancy since last time it was lacking that flavor that I enjoy.  I was banned from trying anyone elses food since they were not willing to try mine.  I was told by my friends that their food was good.  The only note of discontent I heard was that my friend that ordered the Basil Leaf with Beef would order the chicken in the future since it had better flavor.

My green curry was wonderful.  All of the spices melded together and I felt that the beef was perfect due to the strength of the sauce.  I can already crave that sauce again and will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love thai food and while the waitress was super nice the food was just so so. I'm use to much more flavorful thai food. I also got really sick later that evening. I really want to blame the food, but one can never be 100% sure. I did end up throwing my leftovers away. 

I got the massuaman curry, the boyfriend got some soup/noodle dish, best friend got pad thai, and her friend ordered their version of drunken noodles. They were all adequate but not \"good\". If you're looking for really good thai, try Nicky's on the North Side or in Verona."}
{"text":"Perfect BYOB spot. Eggplant dishes are recommended. Quick and friendly service. I would seek this place out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Average food, poor ambience being a bit cramped. The only positive is the dynamic part of downtown this is located in."}
{"text":"I haven't found a better Thai place in Pittsburgh yet, and I've been trying.  I can't stop eating their Spicy Basil, which is fantastic.  This is probably my favorite place to eat in the South Side."}
{"text":"I came here with family after a long day of rollercoaster riding over at Kennywood. We were touristing and my sister thought this place looked pretty good. I was not disappointed. The neighborhood looked a little rough around the edges, but seeing that this spot had the roll-up doors made lots of sense. I'm into adaptive reuse and delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurants hidden in neighborhoods. 

Anyways, we ordered a few plates of crab rangoons and the wonton tacos and it was all very good. Our server was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Lemongrass soup and it came in a big bowl with lots of seafood and noodles. The broth was very flavorful. I'd come back here. 

I did remove a star because I was dying for a glass of wine and they didn't have alcohol? It's BYOB. What the hell is it with PA and the BYOB?! Is it THAT hard to get a liquor license in this state? wtf. I mean, I'm coming from the bible belt. You can't get a drink before noon on Sundays, but atleast you don't have to BYOB everywhere. What do ya'll do? Just tote around coolers full of booze here? lol...Ok, let me stop."}
{"text":"Tha Me Up is a perfect three. It isn't bad and the lunch is a great deal but there is nothing special about the food. My server Alan was great! He seemed to have every table in the restaurant and still managed to be attentive. I ordered Thai fried rice and it was good but nothing stand out. I did appreciate the decor but not enough to hurry back!"}
{"text":"Change in management?  Service....We used to come here a lot but haven't in awhile. The food was fine but the service was less than acceptable.  There was a different man/woman working the front.  They were too busy to deal with the tables.  He helped resolve chicken I didn't think but wasn't friendly.  The woman was so rude -she didn't want to deal with any request -like can we can get a knife?  And for BYOB?  They don't have a wine bucket to keep our white cold?  What happened...."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! Literally everything on the menu is delicious. My favorites are the pad thai, wonton tacos, spicy rice, or the green curry."}
{"text":"How can I not review the place that bears the same name as my Thai restaurant list? 

I remember the first time I visited Thai Me Up. After a long day in the office I didn't really feel like going out out.. but needed some food. I'm usually always craving sushi or Thai. A coworker recommended Thai Me Up as some acceptable takeout and I anxiously called for some Pad Thai. 

As soon as I head over to pick it up, it starts pouring. I mean like there was a tornado warning later that night pouring storm. I was half tempted to cancel my order and get delivery but I'm glad I didn't. By the time I arrive it's so bad that in the 40 seconds it took me to run in from across the street I was completely soaked. When I walked in, the establishment was close to empty and everyone stopped and stared at me like an awkward episode of a movie.

But it was so worth it. I'm usually the person that can handle cheap Chinese takeout but likes their Thai a little more upscale. This, however, was a true exception. Perfect heat and it tasted amazing. I've been back nearly every visit to PGH since."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5

Summer rolls: Light, tightly packed, clean and delicious. The sauce was not a typical peanut sauce or hoisin-based sauce that I've come across in Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Rather, it was something more of on the acidic side, as if they added some kind of vinegar and/or fish sauce to make it much tangier. Overall, very tasty.

Pad thai: I have a strong sweet tooth and like the noodles to be chewy, and this delivered exactly that. The noodles were a bit too chewy, and I really had to use my incisors (front teeth, chomping down and sawing) to break the noodles..or I could have asked for a knife. The sauce was not as savory or salty as I would've liked. Overall, I thought this was a delicious noodle dish but not really what I would expect pad thai to be.

Mint beef salad: Insanely delicious! Although the presentation was not memorable, the flavor was spot on! Beef was cooked incredibly well, very juicy, well-seasoned, and flavorful. The mint was also very pronounced and really enhanced the overall salad.

Plenty of street parking after 6PM, ambiance is casual and nice for a date. Overall food was very tasty, but it wasn't exactly what I'd expect as Thai food."}
{"text":"Got the summer rolls, spicy lemongrass salmon salad, and lemongrass seafood noodles. The summer rolls were unremarkable, but the salmon salad was tasty and generously portioned. The lemongrass seafood noodles had lots of fish, crab meat, shrimp and vegetables. It was hearty and very flavorful. For dessert, lemongrass ice cream, which is enough to share for two, and had a distinct lemon flavor. Small cork fee for BYOB."}
{"text":"The decor is nice and the service is really friendly, but the food quality doesn't match the prices.

The food seems to be on par with food court quality, but it's $9. If you want something quick while bar hopping, this might be what you're looking for.

If you want a quality thai dinner, you should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good Thai food from the wings and fried chicken wontons to the red curry shrimp and pineapple chicken fried rice.  The food was out in record time.  It is a BYO which is nice. Small serving area but no wait. Kitchen closes at 9 on Saturday night so we just slipped in in time."}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to this place. I get the Spicy Basil Noodles multiple times a week. They're just so good! Also, the staff is super friendly. Definitely my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The location itself is cute,  the waitstaff was excellent...the food however was just OK. I ordered the Basil leaves with chicken.  There is very little spice, the chicken was bland and I was surprised at the lack of veggies. My order was to go and most of the sauce was lost in the bag,  perhaps a bowl type takeout vessel.  The food was not horrible,  the spring roll and mushroom soup were both delicious."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times and have loved the food everytime  until today! today was different, everything was sweet and sticky. As usual the hostess came up to us and asked us about our opinion, on hearing our honest opinion she got furious and said i will make sure you are never served wings and satay again and dont care!!!!!! i was shocked at her response. She took off the charge of the wings, but i guess the way she treated us was unacceptable. Then she goes to the kitchen and bitches about us to the staff and all were staring at us in anger.. Lol!!!! 2 stars for the good food i was served during my previous visits."}
{"text":"Thai Me Up is a nice little gem in the South Side. Every time I crave Thai food, I always feel like there are none that are close enough. I found this one on Yelp on a whim, and it happened to be super close to home, but I never knew about it. I love the coziness of the decor in here, and the staff is pretty friendly. I ordered the pumpkin curry, which is seasonal. It was amazing! It had a nice level of saltiness for the spice, and the spice level was accurate to what I requested. It was the perfect portion of curry and rice, and I left just satisfied enough. I was dying to try their desserts, but was too full for it. I highly recommend this place for dinner any night, or for a cozy, casual date!"}
{"text":"This Thai Restaurant in the Southside is a gem on East Carson Street in Pittsburgh. A friend took me here and I throughly enjoyed the ambiance, rustic, antique, with young hip diners and an authentic menu and attentive staff. I ordered the Pho and my friend ordered the Grilled Salmon with Curry. When I return I will revert to a steady staple and classic - Pad Thai, hold the peanuts. The spring rolls were also great, but who can get those wrong. This location is great to pop into and is super casual. The owner's sister is a Phipps Conservatory grad, so take note of their particularly intriguing floral arrangements. Their website is run on SquareSpace, with great use of typography and a parallax theme: thaimeuppittsburgh.com. See their Facebook for clear pictures of the interior and plenty of reviews are on Yelp and UrbanSpoon."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant! I'm in love with their Chicken Pad Thai! Crab Rangoons were much better than most places. You could actually see crab in them where most places it looks more like crab flavored cream cheese. Service was great. The bathroom needed to be cleaner."}
{"text":"I love Thai Me Up.  I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered there.  My favorite is the Green Curry with Chicken, but I make sure not to get in a rut and try other things.  Last time was Spicy Basil Noodles.  Wide, thin, tender delicious noodle  in the savory, spicy garlic sauce.  My husband got the Thai Herbal Sausage.  It was very spicy, with a very complex and delicious flavor.   We also almost always get Steamed Dumplings that come with an awesome sauce and Satay Chicken.  I can't say enough good things about it.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are doing a tour of food in Pittsburgh. Thai Me Up was our Thai choice and we were not disappointed. We wanted to try a little if everything. The rangoons and chicken satay were my favorite apps. The short ribs were surprisingly melt in your mouth. We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place in the 'Burgh!  I love their Pad Thai. Their Satay Chicken is a great appetizer. Their are a lot of choices and they are all great. 
The restaurant is warm and welcoming. The decor is simple and cozy with pops of red. The service was great. Our server answered all of our questions nicely. (We tried new dishes which is why we had questions.)

Overall it is great food, great service and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant before heading on to see Snow White & the Huntsman at South Side Works. We wanted some place cheap and different from our usual steak/burgers/etc. fare.

Thai Me Up (what a stupid name) is small and there isn't much in the way of decor, but none of that really matters as it is also cheap eats. Altogether we had the lemon grass soup, a spring roll, pad thai and green curry with chicken and tofu and a side of steamed white rice.

My rice was soggy on the bottom, which is disturbing when I'm eating out. I can't cook rice to save my life, but, considering it should be rather simple and easy to prepare, it's a little scary when a restaurant can't get it right. The green curry was delicious, but my absolute favorite was the spring roll. This is surprising for me as I hate spring rolls, but the dipping sauce was amazingly good!

The lemongrass soup was also quite tasty and very different from any other soup I've had before. My boyfriend's pad thai was pretty good, though we've both had better elsewhere (can't really complain for the price, though).

I'm only giving Thai Me Up 3 stars because, although the food was tasty, it left you wanting something more flavor-wise. Some of the items were threatening to veer into the bland side of the specturm. Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park was much more appealing, but the location leaves a lot to be desired. I recommend it for better thai food, but if you're looking to hang out in the south side and people watch or go out later, Thai Me Up is the perfect place for some quick, cheap eats."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing and the wait staff is personable. I recommend their tofu pad Thai, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Yumm. Their pineapple curry has been my long time favorite. Very relaxing and modern environment. Love the new store location off the main drag in the Southside. Friendly staff. Will be here again very soon."}
{"text":"Thai me up is a nice eclectic restaurant. The ambiance is nice and service was great.
The food... Sadly, not bad but not good. Just very bland and not very flavorful... It's a shame because I really wanted to like this place since it's so close to work in comparison to my go to thai Nicky's downtown..."}
{"text":"Isolated location from the busy streets of Carson street.  We ordered 2 meals from the chef's special: Thai herbal sausage and the khao soi.  If you're into spicy gingery foods then the sausage is for you.  I couldn't handle the heat but my fiancé was crazy about it. 

As for the khao soi, it's a noodle soup dish with chicken drumsticks.  It has a sweet, hot flavor to it.  We also ordered chicken pineapple basil which was crispy chicken with sautéed onion, bell peppers, and a sweet tangy sauce.  I was a big fan of all of it!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine was in town from the navy stationed over in Thailand and wanted to see what Pittsburgh had to offer for it so I recommend this place. We stopped in early for the lunch special and I'm happy we did! On entering we where greeted seating was fast as there was no heavy lunch rush. We settled on the steamed dumplings for a appetizer and they where packed with flavor. We all got the padthai dish with different spicy levels. The only thing my friend changed was he got glass noodles in his for a extra charge. I got a level 6 and sometimes I can be a baby with super spicy stuff but it was the perfect build up. Another one got 8 and my Thai buddy got a 10. I must say we all crushed the food and we where the perfect fullness. The guy server walking around was so funny and checked in on us often. It was a overall good experience the food was hot and flavorful. I'm happy we came here and so was my friend as always I'll definitely continue to return here."}
{"text":"I have to start out with saying my standard for Thai restaurants was set while I lived in Hawaii, and Pittsburgh Thai restaurants just can't compare. However, I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Thai Me Up.

It is a smaller simple restaurant, but delivers with food and service. We brought a bottle of wine with us, which was immediately opened for us ($3 fee for the BYOB). For an appetizer, we shared an order of steamed dumplings. Very good, and the dipping sauce complimented them nicely. As for an entree, I went with the Z-U noodles (called pad see ew or sober noodles in other Thai restaurants I've been to). The dish was cooked very well, but I wish it would have been spicier. I enjoy spice, but was a little tentative since all Thai restaurants are a little different. The spice scale here is on a scale of 1 to 10 (I'm used to mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot). I went with a 5 thinking it would be comparable to hot, however should have ordered a 7 or 8. The server nicely brought out extra spice in case I needed to make it hotter.

We had a great meal and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant twice. The first experience I had red curry, it was good, but not the best red curry I have had. The sauce is a bit pale red and not the traditional red curry that I am used to, but still good. My friend had the Pad Thai and it was one of the best I have had. Service and experience in this visit was good. 

Second visit was with multiple friends and I had the Vietnamese Pho. I love Pho and I was disappointed. The noodles were not what I'm used to eating and the flavors weren't developed fully. All of my friends liked their dishes and I tried some of their fried rice and it had a great flavor. My friend got the Thai chicken and it was good, but filled with little bones that made it annoying to pick through. Service was slow, but acceptable. 

I would go back, but I want to try the numerous other Asian places first."}
{"text":"In town on business and felt like Thai  
I have an all time favorite out near Robinson but wanted to try something new. 
Had the spicy basil noodle. It is basically large noodles, meat and spice with some fried egg. 
It is decent but still doesn't beat my regular joint. 
If you are in the area and want Thai it is ok but I would probably try other places before coming back."}
{"text":"This place is on my top five favorite Thai spots in Pittsburgh. I work nearby, so I frequent here at least twice a week. Flavorful, fresh and simple thai food that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. Some of my (vegetarian/vegan) favorites include the Spicy Basil Noodles with tofu- minus the egg, Fried Tofu, Coconut Galangal Soup, and fresh spring rolls. Their lemongrass mushroom soup that accompanies lunch specials is nice as well. I've gotten a lot of consistently good meals here.

The atmosphere is a few notches up from other local thai spots, with lots of aged wood, plants, and local art in every corner. The staff is always lovely and welcoming, and the asian market next door (Sweet Panda) that shares the same owners is great as well. Definitely check this place out next time you're looking to grab a bite in the South Side!"}
{"text":"I ordered spicy basil noodles last night and was a little sad at how none spicy it was. I know everyone has a different level of what they consider to be spicy vs. mild but given the fact that a dish is called \"spicy\" they should ask how hot you want it.

That being said she my dish arrived it wasn't as hot a my sisters and by hot to mean temperature. My noodles were closer to warm than fresh out the pan hot but I wasn't too upset. What shocked me more was that I had to ask for extra spice. Like I said there should be a spicy rating for foods that are labeled as such. 

My sisters pho dish was spicier than mine which left me very disappointed. The best spicy basil I've had was at the green mango. They were definitely spicy and had a lot more flavor. I think I'll only come here for the pad Thai noodles. It's better here for lunch."}
{"text":"As one of the south sides longtime residents this place is a no brainer visit for those that want to try something new or are regular Thai-food enthusiasts. The space is quaint with authentic, but charming to decor that's not too over-the-top. The menu is huge with lots to choose from. The servers are friendly so  don't be afraid to ask questions or to ask for certain spice level. I think they are most known for their pineapple fried rice.  It's also BYOB! I nice spot, but to me, not the best Thai in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went here again, and I guess I'm not as in love anymore. This is still a solid place to get nice portions of Thai for fair prices, but it's definitely not the healthiest option, I guess? Well, that's probably my fault for ordering a not-so-healthy noodle dish, but boy this one was swimming in its gravy.. and it was a little too salty. Hmm. 

I know I'm going to come back here... but I'll have to try something lighter next time."}
{"text":"The food here at Thai Me Up is amazing. The atmosphere is relaxed and the service was great! Recommend anyone in the Southside area to make it a point to eat here."}
{"text":"Although normally I would not have thought to try this place since I live much closer to a plethora of decent Thai places (e.g. Thai Gourmet, Pusadee's, Thai Cuisine), I stopped in to get take-out while waiting for my boyfriend to rescue me from having locked myself out of my car, which happened to be parked right in front of here.

I ordered the spicy Thai fried rice but with Thai basil added (kind of like a cross between the spicy basil noodles and the spicy fried rice) and they happily catered to my off-menu request.  Also ordered a massaman curry with chicken.  The service was very friendly, and the takeout came out in 10 minutes, which is on the fast end of my takeout experiences.  The guy behind the counter was also very kind to let me hang out inside the restaurant, at a corner table, even after I received my takeout, so that I wouldn't have to wait for my boyfriend outside in the cold!

The food itself, though, turned out to be pretty mediocre.  The basil fried rice was fine, but it didn't hold a candle to Thai Cuisine's spicy basil rice (my favorite in the city).  The flavors were not very complex and it was a tad on the salty side.  The massaman curry was better, probably better than Thai Cuisine's, and it was a good spice level.  But nothing to write home about -- Pusadee's is much better, and since we live so much closer, I doubt I'll ever trek out to the south side just to seek out the food here.

I do admit that I like the punniness of the restaurant's name, though!"}
{"text":"I love Thai Me Up and am lucky enough to live in walking distance of it. Portions are large, prices are fair, soups and sauces are not overly salted or sugary and meat seems to be high quality (you get regular shrimp and not those dinky ones and chicken breast instead of chicken parts). They are very quick and offer great seasonal items, like the delicious pumpkin curry and mango coconut sticky rice. They are willing to accommodate special requests and don't put up a fuss about it (steamed veggies and meat), sub broccoli for bean sprouts...that sort of thing. I usually get takeout, but I know it's BYOB for dine-in. All in all, my favorite Thai place in town. My personal favorites are the Thai chicken noodle soup, pumpkin curry, pineapple curry and cashew chicken with extra chicken."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food & service were good.  I plan to visit again soon.

{"text":"I don't like to rate a restaurant based only on carry out, but my carry out pad Thai was so poor it reflects on the restaurant as a whole. I read all the reviews and was somewhat cautious, but figured : How bad could pad Thai be? Well just imagine plain sliced up chicken in spaghetti and covered in salt water. No egg, no peanuts, no lime, and certainly no flavor.  In addition, it was served in a doggy bag type plate with no utensils or soy sauce,   I'll avoid the one star rating because the ambience and decoration looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Was a Thai virgin now a Thai lover.  AWESOME!!!
Tried a bunch of items from the menu and the favorites are the crunchy enoki mushrooms, steamed dumplings and the Thai green curry, delicious"}
{"text":"These folks close before the stated time.  Went in at 840 on a Saturday and were rudely turned away by the host.  I will from now on stay away and recommend everyone does as well...they clearly don't care about the customers business"}
{"text":"Got the pho to try it. Wonton broth with some over cooked meat and none of the traditional toppings. Made me vomit at 5am like I was getting paid by the ounce. The decor is great though. But not worth the vomit."}
{"text":"One of the only places worth eating in the South Side. The Pad Thai is amazing, very fresh, the noodles aren't that fake orange color. I don't normally like crab Rangoon, since it's super unhealthy but it is absolutely amazing here! The flavors are to die for.
 
The service is friendly and fast, my boyfriend and I were seated right away, and our orders were taken in a timely manner. It's a small place towards the end of Carson street, a little bit away from the bar hustle. The inside is on the smaller side, it reminded me of the restaurants in NYC I used to go too. It's quaint but because of this I wouldn't recommend if you had more than four people. 

It's great food, cheap prices, and fast service."}
{"text":"We had been there twice. The lunch price is very good. The green curry is great. 
Tofu salad is also very good. We like the place. The only thing is it is a little far from us."}
{"text":"i've had really good and really bad experiences here.
the first time i went, i had some sort of curry bowl dish and it was very good. i also tried the thai tea which i really like.
the second time, they were out of both ice and tofu. it was hot outside and thank god i wasn't a vegetarian.
the third time, i got a vegetable dish. the food in general is pretty good, some more than others. the service isn't bad. and neither are the prices. the atmosphere is ok.. pretty small place though. they can be pretty slow too. seems like a better place for take out than an actual sit down dinner, but i'd still recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"It is a really cute place with good music and great food. The service was awesome and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to thai me up at least a dozen times now and it only gets better and better. I always get the pad thai which is my favorite I have ever had. I have also had the steamed dumplings which are great. 

Don't forget to BYOB. You can bring your own wine with just a small corkage fee. All of the meals are under 12 dollars and delicious. My buddies also really like their pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  No one can step to it.  Spring rolls are delicious, curry is delicious and their pad Thai is fantastic.   Everyone on staff is really nice, it's a really cozy atmosphere and worth dealing with all ridiculous of spending time on the south side."}
{"text":"I discovered Thai me Up a few years ago when I was frequenting and eventually living in the Southside of Pittsburgh.  This became the place my girls and I would meet up before a night out.  As college students and young professionals, the BYOB feature is ideal for us to save a few bucks and still enjoy a great spirit with our food.  The food is great for the price and offers a variety that doesn't make you feel like you are just eating first class Chinese.  I highly recommend any of their curry dishes- try a 10 if you are into breaking a sweat over your dinner!  The only draw back of this place, and this is as of late, is that it is small.  You have to wait for a table and they tend to shuffle through customers on a busy friday or saturday night.  Weekdays go anytime, Weekends go early (before 6) or late (after 830)- either way - just go!"}
{"text":"A sad excuse for Thai food. If you enjoy real Thai food with beautiful flavor, do not, I repeat do not come here. Unbelievably disappointed. My girlfriend and I love Thai food. We frequent Nicky's, Noodlehead, and various others in our neighborhood. Thinking this place would be pretty cool we headed over. They greeted us, sat us. Waited about 15 minutes for anyone to come to us to take any type of order. Let me mention, there were only 2 people, but we were first sat before the 3 other tables that came in. Finally someone came over, we ordered vegan Thai iced tea, cup was filled with ice, maybe 3/4 of cup of actual tea for 3.50. Waited another 15, trying to get the attention of one of the servers. We ordered the fried mushrooms, Thai me up rolls and a red curry. Before we could tell them a spice level he went away. 
The mushrooms were literally drizzlings of tempura batter. The mushrooms has disintegrated from the hot oil I imagine. No flavor or taste besides fried batter. 
Their signature Thai me up rolls which were noted to be with mint and basil-ended up being completely soggy, not a tight nor fresh spring roll. Stuffed with vermicelli and iceberg lettuce and a tiny piece of basil. 30 minutes iN, still no curry or someone to refill waters or clear plates. 
They brought out the red curry took the plates and we didn't talk to them again until the check. It was an extremely light pink color, almost white with almost no broth. We just asked for veggies-definitely frozen carrots, bamboo shoots  and broccoli. Zero spice, zero flavor. Absolutely not Thai food. Tasted like straight up coconut milk. Of course, both servers were able to straight up ignore us but not come over to see how the meal was. It was taking so long, so I tried to eat it and had another bite. They kept looking at us, ignoring us, refilling every other table with waters etc. (were both servers, so we understand how service should be given) Finally, after 25 minutes of waiting, we asked kindly if maybe we didn't get the right dish, or it was seasoned properly/unfinished, asked if we could maybe exchange for something else, she took it away, they brought the check. We took it up to the counter, proceeded to explain our disappointment, that we still offered to try something else. He was exceptionally rude and stated, 'The vegetables dilute flavor, it's why it's watery'. Thanks for admitting your curry is watery. And that logic also makes no sense. He finally said he'll take off the curry to that which we never come back. Absolutely unprofessional, kind and NOT Thai food. We tried to be kind and gentle because we get how working in a restaurant can be, and we're treated horribly. After we walked out, he literally came out the door and said 'Never come back, K, thanks bye'. Worst 'thai' restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Pad Thai was very bland/dry and didn't even come with a lime- or any flavor for that matter. Pineapple fried rice had barely any pineapple in it and both portions were small for the price of the dish. Mad Noodles on East Carson wins by a long-run."}
{"text":"Thai Me Up is a nice little spot tucked away from the main drag in the South Side. My coworker and I wanted to check it out and so we stopped in last Monday afternoon. The space is essentially a garage with cool rustic finishes. It's a bright, pleasant little place.

They do a lunch menu with smaller portions but still plenty of options. Each entree comes with either lemongrass mushroom soup or a spring roll (or both for an extra dollar). My friend and I couldn't choose, so we opted for both. The soup was served very hot and was a nice starter. The little spring roll was also good, but it didn't really stand out from other spring rolls I've had in the past.

I ordered chicken in garlic sauce (which also had broccoli, carrots, and greens) served with white rice. I have ordered this dish from other places in the past, and have found that it is usually packed with flavor--unfortunately this time I found it to be pretty bland. The portion was generous (despite being the smaller lunch size), but I just felt like it was missing something.  

We're lucky to have a bunch of Thai options in the city, but I'm not convinced about this place yet. A lot of people seem to love it, so I might need to try again and choose something with a little more spice."}
{"text":"When ordering from the vegetarian portion of the menu I asked about any dairy or egg in the basil tofu and told the waiter that I was vegan.  He said that while a few of their dishes are egg and dairy free, they use fish sauce in everything on the menu - and they do not make dishes without it because it isn't authentic.  I asked if there was anything on the menu that didn't have fish sauce in it and he said that they could probably make the fried rice without fish sauce, but they definitely put oyster sauce in it.  He then told me that oyster sauce doesn't have any actual oyster extract in it so I can eat it.  Oyster sauce does have oyster extract, among other things that make up the sauce.  

Very disappointed that the waiter was so unaware and unwilling to accommodate.  Menu should be clear that Thai Me Up's version of vegetarian actually includes fish or other seafood."}
{"text":"Before I left for a year stint in Seattle, Thai Me Up was my *favorite* thai restaurant, well, maybe tied with Thai Place but for different things.  Thank god one of my friends ordered this dish and I found my latest obsession:  Spice Basil Noodles which I spent almost 6 months in Seattle trying all of their thai food to find out it is also called Pad Kee Mao.  It still makes my knees weak."}
{"text":"It's been a really really long time since I've been here. I almost forgot about the place. It may have actually been one of my first (or second) Thai places I tried. Although I believe first time may be Spice Island. Irregardless...

I was uneasy considering a lot of my friends had only rated it three stars. But the thing is, I was pleasantly surprised! Their lunch menu is super simple. One sheet with about 15ish dishes all for $6.95 AND you get soup or an egg roll (they call it spring roll, but I always consider spring rolls not fried, and this definitely hit the fryer). 

I've been branching out more in my Thai adventures, so I went with the Green Curry. All along I was thinking I'm not a fan of curry when, turns out, I'm a BIG fan of curry! I'd go so bold as to say I love it now! You know why, because it was delicious here and I love coconut anything. 

You may not get a lot in that small pot, but at the end, you're satisfied. I had large veggies like broccoli and beans with shrimp I added in. Around 4 or 5 shrimp did the job, as well as a bowl of rice on the side. I loved everything about it. The sauce was creamy and coconut-ty, with just the right spice (around a 4, I'd say. I'm a lightweight). 

What a deal, right? I'm so excited to go back. Especially considering my friends meal, the spicy noodles with tofu, was also incredibly flavorful and delicious. You've definitely won me over Thai Me Up... I'm just sad it took me so long to come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant!!  I've enjoyed the food since there open on Carson.  The new location is cool!  Excellent quality food, and great prices!!  Will recommend to any Thai food lover!  
My last visit, the food continued to exceed my expectation, and the price was great!!  I'd pay more because of the quality!!!!!!!!  

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when Thai Me Up moved down the street from my apartment a few weeks back and have been meaning to try it ever since - last night I finally got my chance. First I'd like to mention how much I love the venue. The \"garage-door\" style windows make you feel like you are sitting outside when they are open, which is great. The décor is also very nice. This is a very Americanized Thai restaurant in that the menu caters to people who are not super adventurous or are new to eating Thai food, but there are still plenty of options and it is relatively inexpensive (and BYOB!). The food was pretty good and while it is not my favorite Thai restaurant in town, I'm sure the convenience of the location will keep me coming back pretty regularly."}
{"text":"My husband and I ended up here after a not-so-great experience at a different restaurant down the street. We went out for Thai food and, I'm not sure why, this wasn't even on our radar initially. We walked in and were immediately greeted, handed menus, and told to sit wherever. Water was brought over immediately and drink orders were taken. The waitress/hostess/Jill of all trades that was working was so friendly and bubbly, she seemed genuinely glad there were customers, rather than other places where the staff can be kind of...blah. We ordered crab rangoon, chicken gyoza(the special of the week,) pad thai, and spicy basil noodles (which I found out is what is usually called drunken noodles elsewhere.) Everything was cooked perfectly and amazing. The spice level could have been a little more, but that is on us, because we didn't know what to expect so we didn't get it overly so the first visit. (When we reheated it, though, it was a lot spicier and still delicious!) Give this place a try, it was great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Great for take out or dine in. If you dine in, the service is great. Highly recommend the chicken pad Thai"}
{"text":"Went again only because of a group of friends had decided. It's alright second go to."}
{"text":"I went to their newish home off Carson treat and was thoroughly impressed with the food. I'm not sure if they got a new cook or what happened, but the food was much better the last time I went there (when It was on carson st.)

Kudos to the chef."}
{"text":"Two words: Pineapple fried rice. Best thai food in Pittsburgh, and I've had it all."}
{"text":"I like the location of this place because it is located on a side street in a neighborhood setting. I also liked how the owners re-purposed a car glass shop for the restaurant. As far as the food, I think it is just average. The prices are reasonable and they have a rather large menu to choose from, but it's not a place that I would really have a strong desire to return to. However, it is a place I would go to and hangout with friends if we were grabbing a casual lunch in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's a nice change of pace for those who want a different flavor of Asian than just Chinese or Japanese. The restaurant itself has a nice sense of ambiance about it as well."}
{"text":"Given that this is the closest Thai place to me, I have reluctantly gone a few times. Always felt like I was getting hardly anything for my money, but today was definitely the last time I will ever order food from here. I ordered the red curry that I have gotten three other times for takeout. For some reason this time I received what can only be called the \"snack portion\" of rice and a container half the size I usually get for the curry itself. I understand raising prices, I don't, however, think you should raise prices while you simultaneously  cut the portions in half.

In terms of taste/quality of the food, the place is decent, at best. Nothing special. Try somewhere else with better food and more reasonable prices if you're looking for Thai."}
