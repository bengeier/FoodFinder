{"text":"I went there to enjoy some time with my dad who loves to play the horses. The bartender (blond hair) was very nice and brought us two glasses of water. The waitress however was not so gracious. I asked her for a draft beer and paid for it. She never returned with my change or to ask if I wanted another. Poor service on her part.We played a  couple races before we decided to go elsewhere to play and eat. Sorry but not impressed."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing time playing trivia last night.  Did some off track betting and had some great food.  So glad the women of Times 3 Happy Valley have taken over this location.  Love it here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this bar restaurant OTB for the last seven eight years. Friday night was one of the worst times I ever had there because one of the servers ignored me and my date. I have a broken knee and she would not even give us water or anything to drink. I had to physically limp up to the bar to get a glass of water. She knows who she is. I feel that a person that does not value her Patriots or customers should not be employed by the company. I will think twice before I come to this establishment again. FYI it's only the location on Union Hills period after the new ownership!"}
{"text":"I would have been embarrassed to serve the plate to me.  I ordered sliders and had three different ones.  The green chili burger was the best of the three.  The turkey cheddar was nice and hot in the middle, cold on the edges.  The kicker was the grilled cheese.  A nice slider bum with three small pieces of cheese.  Not even melted. Didn't even cover the whole bun.  At least my husband's blt was decent and the fries, well, passable."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a beer and watch a game. Delicious food, shout out to Chef Ben!!"}
{"text":"Based solely on first impression you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. Noticed the dirty windows first  thing, sticky menus, nasty smell upon entering which may come from the men's room because the door was open and it smelled as well, to the same crowd of  \"diehard\" gamblers watching OTB. Was really looking forward to this place being taken over by Times 3 as their place on Happy Valley is such a nice place. What a shame"}
