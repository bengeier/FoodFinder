{"text":"Visited on Saturday 9/19/15. Wait was long service was terrible. The food is over priced. We had a party of 6 people at our table. We waited 25 min before the server came and took our order. No one got their food at the same time. Our food came out at 3 different times with 20 minutes in between each time. Server came to our table 2 different time and attempted to server food that was not even ours One persons Pizza was under cooked.. An 18 percent tip automatically added to our bill even though the service was bad. If you are paying 17 dollars for an individual size pizza and 10 dollars for a field green salad you should not get this kind of service."}
{"text":"Cucina Bella is rocking the ingredients at this great pizza place.  They are making the mozzerella!!!  and importing all the best ingredients. Get the antipasto you will not be dissapointed.  Hands down some of the best crust this side of the Poconos.  We had the Capricciosa w. fresh mozz, artichokes, baby portobellos, prosciutto and basil, fresh from the garden outside.  Awesome.  We were very sad to see him move from Cestones in Mt. Lebo to open CB but am very happy we finally made it.  BYOB so bring some vino and some friends and than dive on in."}
{"text":"Cucina Bella is an outstanding Resturant , with the highest quality ingredience and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"First visit last night after hearing rave reviews.  The place was jammed tight, and the noise level extremely loud.  There are definitely more tables crammed into the space than their web site shows in the photos.  The service was excellent with a menu limited to pizza, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers.  Everything served looked great on other tables.   The stuffed figs were delicious.  The cheese filing overwhelmed the taste of the figs, but the honey drizzled over was a nice touch.  The caprese salad was not quite as good as home made, but definitely better than most places.  The imported mozzarella seemed a bit old.  They smashed it down between the halved cherry tomatoes and it was a little too firm to be fresh.  Our pizzas came separately, and the ingredients tasted all fresh.  My only complaint was that they left almost 2 1/2\" of bare crust all the way around the 12\" pie.  I would have preferred the fixings to go all the way up to the edge, or at least within 1\" of it.  Having to eat that much dry crust was a waste, with nothing to dip it into in lieu of more fixins.  $16 for a pie should buy me a little more goodies.    It's BYOB and we brought our own wine.  Dinner for two pizzas, one salad, and one appetizer was over $70.  With too much empty crust and the really loud noise level, I'm only giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Terrific find. Great pizzas, matched by tremendous calzones (meatball and pepperoni I've had and cannot pass up) and the meatball appetizer is a must. The people, from the owner and manager to the wait staff and valets, make the experience thoroughly enjoyable. Plus it's BYOB so bring a bottle or two and if the weather is right, great seating outside."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Alicia did a fantastic job. A little too loud for my liking though. A very noisy group of women near us made it impossible to carry on a conversation with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 rating for the salad selection alone. I could barely decide which one to try (decided on the kale with pine nuts and lemon). Also tried the traditional and daily special pizza and both were very good. I wish this place were closer I would go more often."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. I would absolutely recommend this place. There are tons of delicious options to choose from, but for my kids, they like pepperoni and black olives. This restaurant does not have black olives, we tried the green olives and my kids loved it. I would also recommend this restaurant because it is very close around were I live. I live in Upper St. Clair. Whenever I am hungry I take my family out to eat here."}
{"text":"So sad...we invited friends from the North Hills after bragging about this restaurant...their pizza is the best and the meatballs were incredible.  HOWEVER, last night was a very bad experience.  We ordered the meatballs, they were much smaller and over cooked.  In fact, they were crispy.  The sauce was still good as we had experienced in the past.  Next, came the pizza.  We ordered a favorite but when it came out, it was soggy in the middle and the toppings were sparse, unlike all of the other times.  Another friend ordered chicken on her salad but it was over-cooked and was like eating rubber.   Has something changed?    Oh by the way, our friends had the cheese plate which was fine but the calzone came out burnt and our friend only ate a piece.  When the server asked if he wanted a box, he said 'no'.  Surprised if he had only eaten a bite, that she would not have asked why.  We will go another time but hope this was an aberration and the regular cook was sick!"}
{"text":"Have been to there 5 times, the pizza is fantastic....love the antipasto and the salads....love that it is byob....It has become our favorite casual dining spot....trust me you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"One of my favorite BYOB spots in Pittsburgh. I have been back more times than I can count because of all of the delicious pizzas and for a good price. Anything with truffle oil is delish. My favorites are the rustica salad and the pizza del ray mmmm..  Almost forgot to mention my favorite part- the basement! Feels like you are in Italy, rustic chandeliers, wine everywhere, cool and dark.. Awesome for a small get together"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! Went with the hubby last Saturday and loved our salad that we shared because it was plenty big enough. And then we had a pizza with prosciutto,artichokes and fresh basil. It was so scrumptious. And did I mention the meatballs? Be sure you have those too!"}
{"text":"Four of us went there on Friday night.  When we arrived the hostess told us it would be a 20 minute wait.  Approximately 10 minutes later another person told us it would be an hour wait.  Strange, right?  Our take on this was that other requests possibly from \"preferred\" customers had come in???   The girl told us she could seat us outside.  It was less than 70 degrees out and silly us agreed to this.   Needless to say there were no heaters and we froze.  Additionally it was dark out and they didn't even provide a candle for the table so that we could see our food and drinks.  To top things off, the waitress seemed to have forgotten about us.  The food was decent but overpriced.  Needless to say we will not be returning there.   It was a very poor customer experience."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Cucina Bella.  Wonderful! From the food to staff to decor, I finally found a restaurant I loved. I've tried a few new places in the last couple of months and this place is the only one I can say I will go back! BYOB is a bonus."}
{"text":"Not too busy for a Tuesday night so we were disappointed to have 2 pizzas that were served relatively cold- made us believe that they were pre-made and weren't made fresh as we would expect."}
{"text":"Best pizza crust in tri-state area, maybe farther!  Fresh ingredients & unique flavors make the salads very special.   Always feels like \"home.\""}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in the south hills! The staff is very friendly and courteous. I am personally a giant fan of the bambino pizza with pepperoni and sausage, just outstanding!! My only complaint is it tends to get hot on busy nights but other than that this place is just a dream!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. They serve pizza, Calazones, and panini. Great appetizers. It is BYOB. Corking fee is $5. The staff is great and so is the service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, though a tiny bit small and great food.  We got the meatball appetizer and it was yummy!!  6 of us split 4 pizzas and we had a few to take home.  The crust is delicious.  They are fairly new, so no liquor license yet, so BYOY.  I even saw a guy with a small cooler with beer! The only complaint is that they only take reservations for 4 people.  I thought that was strange.  Also, you can't be seated until your WHOLE party is there. Cork fee is only $5.00 and $3.00 for beer.  Nice place and will do well."}
{"text":"Love Cucina Bella. Been coming for years ever since it opened. Even though I live out of state, every few months when I visit I make it a point to come here at least once! Usually twice. It has a great atmosphere both upstairs and downstairs. The pizza is terrific and fresh, the crust is always delicious. Our favorites are the margherita and the pizza anna (sans the red peppers and sub cherry tomatoes instead). The balsamic glaze on the Anna is out of this world good. The combination of flavors is top notch. BYOB is a nice feature, too. Usually too full to eat dessert but friends have and they've enjoyed it! We always seem to get the same server and she is terrific, super friendly. Will continue to keep coming back again and again. Easily the best pizza around."}
{"text":"We have been several times.  Always amazing food and service! You can't go wrong here. Desserts are flown in from Italy and are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I came after seeing all the good reviews, but our experience was not satisfactory - waited 40 mins for the pizza. The cucina Bella pizza was very plain and not enough flavor. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"Loved this little place. The food was Delish! Staff was friendly. The meatball app actually tasted like mine you could tell they were homemade. We had the Anna pizza and lived it. We will most def go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been enjoying Cucina Bella for about 4 years. At first, we came for the pizza. Awesome and not like your neighborhood pizza. Service was always good. Young people working to make some spending money or college savings. But always smiling and helpful.  Then we came for the calzone, oh my!  And then we came for the meatballs!! Better than my own which is the ultimate compliment.  Tonight we were back again after a few months; maybe since last fall, not sure. It was not good.  We waited inside the front door for about 10 minutes. It was not a busy night. Most tables were empty.  Finally greeted and brought to a table. I was glad I checked my chair because there was a piece of greasy food on it.  Three of four wine glasses were dirty or had lipstick on them. Two of four plates were still crusted with someone else's food. Really? The biggest let down were \"the meatballs \". Oversized from how they always were, which made them tough. The sauce was dark and over done and too thick. Even the bread served with the meatballs was not crispy! We saw the owner leaving when we pulled up. Hey!  Come back!  This is not how you want your reputation to go. Don't let your short legacy go. Be there. Check the plates. Wine glass. Meatballs!   We will be back. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Just visited tonight for the first time and everything was excellent! At first I was a little hesitant because we had our 14 month old daughter with us, but everyone was very accommodating and warm. Service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the meatballs and fresca salad to start. The meatballs were served piping hot with soft, fresh bread and a bright, delicious red sauce. The arugula salad was very crisp and the balsamic vinaigrette was delicious. We then followed up with the Santa Lucia pizza with pistachio pesto and spicy sausage, which was absolutely divine. Seriously, some of the best pizza I've had in a long time, and I eat pizza on a fairly regular basis. The crust is thin and crisp, and is perfectly cooked throughout--doesn't get soggy in the middle. Everything was perfect for the three of us to share, and we left satisfied and without any guilt on price. An appetizer, soft drink, generously large salad, and pizza split between two adults and a toddler came to $45 and was plenty for dinner. We would have stayed for dessert if it hadn't been so close to bedtime. Can't wait to go back!  Just a note about the atmosphere as well: it can get pretty loud, but we weren't bothered because we have a small child."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that my family has been here many times, but tonight was our last. The meatballs used to be fantastic, but now are small and overlooked without enough sauce. The salads have decreased in size, not in price. My caprese salad came out without mozzarella cheese.  We had to order an extra pizza that took well over 30 minutes to receive. We paid way too much for subpar food that used to be much better. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The Joe T pizza is phenomenal.  One of my absolute favorite date BYOB restaurants.  I'm very disappointed they removed the mozzarella bar from their new menu, but their pizzas, meatballs and salads are excellent."}
{"text":"This was our second time here  and we ordered meatballs which were good for appetizers and 2 calzones which we were disappointed in.... I believe there was only 1 link of sausage in the calzones cut up into little pieces... Very disappointing. Along with that my wife ordered a sausage panini, it contained  1 link of sausage  split  in half which did not nearly fill the bun ... Where's the meat, all bun. The bill was $54.00 and that is without drinks or tip!!"}
{"text":"Well.... We tried to go there for dinner tonight around 7:50 and chose there for the outside patio. Unfortunately they said they close the patio at 7:30 because they're in a residential neighborhood. Seems ridiculous. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Rude staff and I don't see the purpose of paying for overpriced pizza. I don't know why people go here for mediocre overpriced food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a friend's birthday and the service was great, considering the waitress had to put up with a large party. The atmosphere is nice too. But the food was just okay and it seemed a bit overpriced. I got a margherita pizza and my husband got the lucca panini and they were nothing special. I think cucina bella wants to identify itself as a fancier establishment but I'm not sure if it's accomplishing that by serving mostly pizza, sandwiches and salads. Perhaps the fancier pizzas is where it's at so I'll have to try something more original next time."}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and always enjoyed my meal very much. This past time was very underwhelming, which is definitely not the norm but enough to make me try to think of another option the next time I want to go out to dinner. We ordered the meatballs, the della casa salad, and the special feature which was a pasta dish. The meatballs were very good, the salad was just ok, and the pasta was pretty bad. For a place that doesn't typically have pasta on the menu I was excited to hear they had it as a feature. When the dish came out I was very disappointed to see that it was macaroni noodles, and the chicken in it was very clearly something that was bought from Giant Eagle pre-cooked, pre-packaged in strips from Tyson or another company. It was also $16 for this dish. I had really talked this restaurant up and my fiancee was surprised at how mediocre the food was for how much I had been raving about it prior. The service is always very friendly and again the meatballs were excellent but probably won't be returning here for awhile since the experience can be so hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is not an Italian Restaurant, it's just an Artisan Pizza place with the most overpriced menu items in Western PA.  $35 for two small personal pizzas, really??  The crust is very good and crispy, but the San Marzano sauce is flavorless, if they put any seasonings in it I'm a monkeys uncle.  Fortunately, I was able to get a blend of Italian seasonings from the waitress which was absolutely necessary.  The wonderful crust is ruined by the sauce which has no body and is like bland tomato sauce right out of the can.  The entire crust soon was a mushy mess.  My wife ordered the Santa Anna and even though its a white pizza, the improper use of goat cheese caused her pizza to be a mushy mess as well.  The waitress offered a dessert menu with no pricing, and when we inquired the waitress told us they ranged from $8.50 to $16.00, even she said they were overpriced.  Overpriced, that's an understatement.  Definitely not worth the price!!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight and ordered the panini with a side salad and the panini was great I would definitely recommend it if you like spicy meat.Tonight it was a little crowded but the service was great and employees were very nice !"}
{"text":"Been here before a couple times, I always have gotten take out, It is small, BYOB, cool little spot. They take resi's for parties of 6 or more, I'm gonna do that! Haven't gotten a thing I haven't enjoyed. Honestly I want to eat everything on the menu. I will be headed back in the near future. The Arugula pizza is great."}
{"text":"Lovely place with a warm family vibe.  Food is delicious, service was excellent.  We were able to get in easily on a Saturday.  Valet and servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"During the fifty five minute wait for pizza we had to endure listening to the manager Carmen say the F word over 20 times while sitting with what seemed to be one of his high school friends. He spent his time sitting in the basement with a baseball cap on at his friends table badmouthing both customers and staff instead of fixing the basement bathroom where the toilet was overflowing. Yelling at a staff member in front of customers about a blown fuse. Would not go back and would certainly not bring children."}
{"text":"Really great pizza - the kale pizza was especially delicious, and great salads too.  The atmosphere inside was so cute, it didn't feel like it should be in the burbs!  Great spot all around, only missing one star because it was really loud inside."}
{"text":"Have been there a couple of times. Don't let the crowded parking lot fool you; there's plenty of seating. The pizza is amazing! So many different choices and all fresh ingredients. The meatballs and antipasto are phenomenal. It is BYOB, which makes it really affordable. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm impressed.  Here's what I like:  - Table bread is warm.  It comes with balsamic and olive oil, but the balsamic is very thick, helping it cling to the bread.  (Don't eat too much before you entree arrives.)  - Salads are fresh and unique - not the basic \"bag of greens.\"  - Entrees are very good.  My pasta dish was very well flavored, the pasta was cooked correctly (not overdone), and everything was well balanced.  - We also ordered pizza, which was excellent.  It is a fairly simple pizza, with a fairly thin crust, tomato sauce that is \"tomatoey\" and not too sweet, and a decent amount of cheese.  - Service was professional.  - The setting is nice.  It's not a huge place, but there is more seating inside than I expected from the outside.  It's well decorated as well.  The only negative was some cooks in the kitchen speaking loudly (and dropping F-bombs...), with their sound pouring out into the dining area - not so cool."}
{"text":"Would that I could marry a pizza. If it were legal, my bride would be called Tartufata. She is an angel draped in truffle oil. Her jewelry is walnuts, fresh mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheese. She is proof that god loves us.   Or maybe her name would be Danielle, a symphony of mozzarella, red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, pistachios and extra virgin olive oil. She is where heaven goes to lay it's head.  Or perhaps her name is Aglietta. Her gown is fresh mozzarella, ricotta, spicy salami, parmigiano reggiano, basil and extra virgin olive oil. They have written songs about her. Perhaps you've heard them.   In this world there is pizza and then there is Pizza. This is the home of the latter."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is that it is BYOB. Having to valet your car was a little unexpected. Service was fantastic but the food was just ok. Not worth the trip unless it is within walking distance."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Great food and great service.  I checked this place out based on the Yelp reviews.  I took my staff to lunch here and everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"This is a cute italian artisan style restaurant. The pizza is unique and uses creative ingredients."}
{"text":"Great Italian food tucked away in Bridgeville! Totally worth the drive from Pittsburgh. Delicious pizza and calzones, fresh salads, and it's BYOB. My husband and I usually split a salad and a pizza. It's more than enough food for two people. There are several creative pizza options, both with and without tomato sauce. This time we went with the Breasola, which has mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheese with thinly sliced steak on top. I usually don't like Gorgonzola cheese, but thought this pizza was really good. The Gorgonzola flavor blended in smoothly with the other cheeses and wasn't super strong. The steak was tender and flavorful and the crust was thin and crunchy, which I like. We had the Fresca salad with arugula and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing.   The BYOB option is a lot of fun and makes it more affordable. There is a small corking fee. We have usually had good service, although this last time it was kind of hard to get the server's attention for refills and questions. They do only (I think?) valet parking, so bring cash for a tip. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or larger, but we haven't ever had to wait too long - this time we arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday and were seated right away. I am a big fan."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!  Have been here twice and find it to be very very good!  The arugula pizza melts in your mouth.  The only thing this place needs is a liquor Liscense"}
{"text":"This was the perfect date night spot! It was absolutely amazing, start to finish. Fantastic service with the sweetest waitress, efficient, & delicious. BYOB that has a louder atmosphere but it only adds to the Italian authenticity. Complimentary valet, nothing bad to say about it. Must stop location!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I live in the city but am always looking for an excuse to drive out to Bridgeville just to go here.   It's a cute quaint atmosphere. The restaurant is pretty small and they get pretty busy around dinner. They only take reservations for groups over 6, but I've never had to wait very long.   I've been here many times and my go to is one of the calzones. They all have meat in them but I'm a vegetarian and they're great about letting me make substitutions. The calzones are huge but delicious! Very high quality cheeses and ingredients. The dough is thin which keeps it from being too heavy. Delicious.   I've also tried their cheese plate and a few of their soups. They always have a soup of the day and it's always delicious. Most recently I had their vegetable and it was so flavorful!  I also love that it's BYOB. We always go with another couple and it's always a great time. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"The service was okay initially, then our waitress disappeared for a while before we ordered. She told us to put our menus on top of each other when we were ready to order. Which we did. We were the only people in the room at the time and we didn't see our waitress (or anyone else) for a while after that.   The food was decent. I got one of their many pizzas and Dad got their meatball calzone. My pizza wasn't great, but it was good. Was my pizza worth the $16 Dad paid for it? Not even remotely. The pizza at Blaze is better, faster, and just a tad over half the price for lots more toppings. I'm not against paying more for better food and service, but if you're not getting better food or service, I see no reason to bother.  I hadn't checked out the menu before dining there and was surprised that it's a pizza place. Since pizza wasn't invented by the Italians, it was surprising given the name even though one of the pictures scrolling on their website is of dough. I'd never seen warm bread with dipping sauce on a menu before. That was different.  Normally with BYOB, you are given glasses, they open the wine bottle, etc. and charge for that. The waitress did not touch either of our drinks other than to remove the bottle & can after we drank them and did not offer a frosted (or any other) glass for us to drink. However, there was a $6 charge on the bill.   The fine print of their website tells you that they're BYOB, though the first picture on their website when I went to it was all wine bottles, which implies that one could order wine. It's not like you're going to bring in a dozen wines to choose from if you're bringing your own. I included the picture of the wine bottles on their website (misleading) and a clip of exactly what it says about their BYOB policy - no fee is mentioned. We didn't see it on the menu either, but after the shocking bill, the waitress found it on the menu (after a while of looking and she works there) - it's listed in very fine print at the bottom of the menu after some info about how they add a huge tip for parties over a certain size and if you don't sign your tab (which is crazy, since a signature is only needed for those who contest the bill). The fee for BYOB is $5 per bottle of wine and $3 per beer can or other bottle (it only mentions beer, but clearly they charged for my drink even though it wasn't a beer)."}
{"text":"Have seen mixed reviews and heard about the place, so we grabbed a bottle of wine and decided to give it a try.  Arrived a bit after 8 and there were a few open tables mainly for 4+ people.  An employee says it will be a few minutes as we need to wait for a 2 top to open. At 8:35 we still were waiting and a 4 top in the corner was open so we asked if we could have that table.  They told us they would have to make a special exception.  That should have been our first sign of the experience.  Ordered meatballs and a pizza.  Meatballs came out fairly quickly which tells me they had them prepped for orders.  They were ok but not great like some of touted.   Then the wait......... for the pizza  45 min later we asked what happened with the pizza.  Mind you we were the last table to to be seated so other orders should have been coming out of the kitchen already.  10 more min go by and we call the server over again to say we either need our pizza or cxl it and remove it from the check.  6 more min later she returns with the pizza when we were ready to walk out and the excuse was that the other side of the restaurant was busy.  I would say the food quality is worth a pick up order but I won't waste my time on such slow and poor service again. Too many good places to eat that I want to try vs ones that could care less how they treat their guests. We did enjoy some of the pizza when we got home though.  Sorry Cucina Bella.  This was a complete service FAIL."}
{"text":"I love this place; I'm a pizza snob and approve. The atmosphere is nice, and it's BYOB. My only issue is I wish there were smaller portions available for lunch, particularly the salads & pizza. My friend and I wanted different pizzas and our own salads, so my total bill: salad, pizza, and soda was over $30. That's ridiculous for lunch! I also wish there were other desserts available like cannoli rather than just the frozen treats."}
{"text":"This is always a great restaurant to come to when I'm home in Pittsburgh. I hadn't been back since I became vegan so I wasn't sure what I would be able to get. The waitress was very helpful and assured me that the pizza dough and sauce are vegan. I made my own pizza without cheese and put a number of vegetables on it. It was very good as always!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. BYOB with no corking fee. No big entrees, but lots of pizza options. Indoor / outdoor seating. Definitely order the bread for the table- worth $2.25!"}
{"text":"this place is great but no brick oven - food quality compares favorably to Il Pizzaiolo in Mt. Lebanon albeit there are no pasta dishes - the salads are large and fresh and the pizza is some of the best of this style in the area - i go with my wife and friends on a regular basis and the quality is consistently good - BYOB too"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I were staying in Bridgeville to attend a local dance competition. Not wanting to eat dinner at a fast food or chain restaurant we turned to Yelp for suggestions and discovered Cucina  Bella. The reviews were good so we thought we'd give it a try. Are we ever glad we did.  We started our meal with the Antipasto Carmenucci, which was loaded with fresh ricotta, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives, and Italian meats and cheeses. It was delicious. It  would have been a meal in itself. For dinner we ordered the Cucina Bella pizze, which was excellent as well.   The waitstaff was very friendly as was the owner who brought our pizza to the table and spent a few minutes chatting with us and made us feel very welcome.  We only live a little over an hour away so we may have to make another visit soon."}
{"text":"Pizza average. High expectations. Let down. Horrible service spend your money else where. Like pulling teeth to get water refilled, and took over ten minutes to get parmesan and crushed red pepper. Server was surprised we were upset, and gave attitude."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times. Very good pizza and service. The wood top tables were also pretty cool and added to the overall feel of the place."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood pizzeria in a neighborhood proprietor-like setting (Il Pizzaiolo is huge and impersonal by comparison.) Treat yourself to the Tartufola pizza and the Noce salata. The absence of a brick oven is not missed -- the flavors are truly authentic -- not a \"Domino's\" experience -- even if only deck ovens are employed."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Food is excellent , service can be spotty at times. A bit pricey, they are right next to Upper St Clair so able to cash in on the clientele there."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight. Very nice layout and staff. We had a salad and pizza. Both the salad and our pizzas were excellent. We took home quite a few slices but really liked the crust and all of the toppings. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with a reservation of 8. This pizza is by far the best I have had in quite some time. My birthday was in October, so I am delayed on this review. However, I am still having those that went with me, saying that they really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The servers are nice. The pizza.. well, the ingredients are fresh and I love brick oven way!  I had the Pizza Del Re..So yum! Everyone at my table had something different. The servings are plentiful (always a plus). I definitely recommend this place for pretty much any occasion, even a date night. Its also BYOB so make sure you have a DD! Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Both pizzas we tried were awesome, but the anna with that balsamic was one of the best I've ever had!   Only complaint was the size of the Caesar salad.  For the price why not load up on the romaine for that great Caesar dressing?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Their authenticate brick oven pizzas are made with very fresh ingredients and taste great.  Make sure to bring a bottle of wine or beer because they do not have a liqueur license.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All I can say is phenomenal pizza!!! Wood fired, great choices of red and white pizzas. My pizza favs are Bleu cheese,figs, with a Balsamic reduction!!!!! A pizza with spicy salami, sausage, and basil!!! The spicy sausage and arugula Panini is delicious,as well as the meatball Panini!! For dessert was a frozen peanut butter ball with a caramel center, covered with chocolate!!! YES,YES,YES!!!! The Tiramasu is an excellent choice as well!!! Prepare for a long wait between 6 and 8 pm, unless you have reservations! Once you eat here, you'll understand why!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Everything about this place was great. The decor, the food, the staff, the music - everything. My mom and I came here for lunch with a few of her friends and we were seated at a nice table and there was enough space between all the patrons so no one felt like they were too close. The place itself is pretty open which is nice. Our waitress was friendly and spot on with her recommendations. We ordered a few different salads, a pizza and a panini. All ingredients seemed fresh and the food was flavorful. We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"First off let me say that the pizza and salad was good and I am pleased that they are doing so well and this property finally has a successful business. But if this is what diners think is wonderful it says little about the dining scene in the south hills.  When i went in to put in my name I was told that there would be a 40 minute wait.  I told the hostess that I was going out to speak with my friends and would let her know if we would be staying. She told me I wasn't allowed to leave the restaurant once i put my name on the list. I was only going out into the parking lot!!!   It was pleasant to be able to drink our wine while we waited and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered a pizza  with mushrooms and artichoke hearts. As I stated the pizza was good.... nice crust but there was probably 6 slices of mushroom and possibly 1 quartered artichoke . Of the six slices 2 of them had no topping at all.  Our arugula salad was quite fresh, but consisted only of the greens, 4 cherry tomato halves and shavings of fresh parmesan (a nice touch).  When we asked for fresh ground pepper we were told that they didn't have it.  10 minutes later the waitress found it.  The thing that put me over the edge was when I was served my coffee in a styrofoam cup.  When I asked for a real cup I was told that they did not have any upstairs and would have to go downstairs to get one.  Our total bill with tip was $72 for one 6 cut pizza, three salads, one shared desert and corkage fee.... along with poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and calzones. No veal,chicken ,pasta etc. Just pizza etc. there are meatballs too. Place is noisy, crowded and has good service. Great for families BYOB"}
{"text":"The food is the best part of the experience at Cucina Bella - the meatballs are delicious, and the pizza is both tasty and crispy.   But the service doesn't match the food - we waited for a table (which we expected) then waited at the table for a server to acknowledge we were there. How long is too long? I think a server should stop by in the first 3-5 minutes after you sit down, even just to acknowledge that they see you and will be right back. Fifteen minutes after sitting down, we placed our order; the meatball appetizer came right away and was frankly, great.  The pizza? Also terrific, even if the waitress mixed up our pies and called them by the incorrect names - one piece in, we figured it out, and happily swapped.  So why am I being so picky? Cucina Bella has the prices of a high-end restaurant - for a few dollars more, I could have gone to Cure, where they not only feed you well, they treat you with care. No one was rude at Cucina, but I felt like the service lacked the attention - and attention to detail - I expect at these prices. I might go back, but pizza is a Pittsburgh staple, so Cucina Bella has a lot of competition in high and low places."}
{"text":"Went there this evening and have noticed from last time service was getting bad. Food is good, pricey for pizza though. Waited 30 min to get seated while tables were empty, then waited another 20 min once seated to get water and our bottle of wine opened. Then 1/2 the food brought out 20 minutes later after our drinks served, and 20 min. after some food brought we got our last pizza which our guests watched us eat ours as they didn't want ours to get cold. Then the waitress cleared our table and waited another 20 min to get the check. Used to be our favorite place, now the waitresses that told us that tables were reserved and couldn't seat is there were resetting the same tables where guests never showed I suppose because they were still vacant when we left two hours later. The waitresses that seemed so stressed were not so stressed to stand and gab at the bar area without any concern to making sure things were flowing. Get over yourself Cucina Bella, I'm done with this place! BYOB or not, not worth it anymore. Pizza shouldn't take two hours and little attention to the clients."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place for pizza in the south hills! Great atmosphere, the wait staff is crazy awesome, and the food is fresh! Can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"Still a fun place to go and love the BYOB.  Took a good bottle of Italian wine to have with our salad and pizza.  We split one of the new creative pizzas and the Noce salad.  Everything is fresh.  Service was good and professional.  The pizza is a thin crust that is crusty and tasty.  We were able to sit outside, seating we prefer since the inside is noisy. there is a nice list of deserts imported from Italy but we never seem to have room."}
{"text":"This is our favorite BYOB... the pizza is some of the best I've had and the wait staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a great location and locally run business. That said, the food quality and menu has changed. Sadly, it has changed for the worse. Portions are smaller and ingredients are not as fresh as they were before. Hopefully the smaller crowds will dictate that the owner finds the errors in his ways. They get one more chance to win us back in the spring."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped on a quiet mid week evening.  There were plenty of tables available, so we didnt have to wait to be seated.  I was really hoping to have a pasta, but the menu is pretty limited to pizza, pannini, salads, and calzones.  We ordered a traditional pizza, a pannini and a calzone.  While my wife enjoyed her pannini, I found the calzone to be rather flavorless and there were large sections that were just dough.  The pizza was just as flavorless as the calzone but it did have a nice crust.  I thought the prices were on the high side for essentially a fancy pizza joint.  They need to expand the menu and bring the prices down a bit ..  We did have good service."}
{"text":"Came at 12:30 on a Saturday and was surprised to see no one was there. My friend and I split the Noce salad and Margherita pizza. The salad was delicious with walnuts, gorgonzola, and fresh mozzarella. Their balsamic dressing is excellent as well. The pizza was also was nicely balanced between mozzarella, sauce, and basil. Their crust is not too chewy either. Perfect amount for two people. Overall, I always enjoy coming here. It is a hidden gem for some delicious pizza and salads."}
{"text":"It pains me to only give one star because I feel like this place has the potential to be amazing.  But unfortunately my experience was anything but. I was looking forward to try this place because so many people have been telling me how wonderful it was. We must have come on an \"off night\". When we arrived, we weren't sure what to expect wait wise because we had seen online that they don't take reservations for parties less than 6. They have complimentary valet but we didn't use it bc there was a spot right on the street. We walked in and to our surprise the hostess went to seat us right away. As we followed her, she suddenly turned around and stated that \" the table she thought was available had people sitting at it\". So we retreated back to the front & were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. That would have been fine except that hostess then disappeared and a new hostess began seating parties that came in after us, not realizing that we were waiting. So we had to bring that to her attention & were sat fairly soon after that. Our waitress came and greeted us quickly & took our drink order.  (They have ice teas bottled from Italy & they were delicious!) We ordered the meatball appetizer & 2 pizzas--The margherita pizza and the 4 formaggi. THEN THE WAIT STARTED. We waited approximately 25 minutes for our appetizer, which was a little longer than we expected but we chalked it up to being a Friday night & being made from scratch. When the appetizer did arrive, it was delicious. The meatballs & sauce were amazing! It was about this time we noticed people around us who had been seated well before we got there, were still waiting for their food. We heard several tables complaining about the wait & wondered how long ours would take. An hour later, still no pizza. Irritating but...Our waitress, Jessie was INCREDIBLE. We understood that she wasn't the one cooking the food so it most certainly wasn't her fault, but the tables around us did not seem to be as understanding. A lot of people were yelling & carrying on like it was her fault the kitchen was being slow. She handled herself fantastically, I don't know that I could've done the same under that kind of pressure. Once our pizza did arrive, it was BURNT. Now, I understand that brick oven pizza is usually more well done but this was beyond that. It was super disappointing. They did own up to their mistakes & comped the pizzas. Again, Jessie was awesome and told us this wasn't the norm & that she hoped we would give them another try, which I think we probably will. I just hope the owners know what a great employee that have in her to be able to make up for their shortcomings. I would definitely like to give them another chance & have the great experience I have heard about!"}
{"text":"Cucina Bella has taken a dive.  Appetizers are not very good.  The polenta and sausage was so spicy it was not edible and the polenta was like rubber (my guess is pre-made like you buy in a roll and slice).  The antipasto has gotten very expensive for what you get.  All of the pizzas were undercooked.  It was once a reasonably priced alternative to Il Pizzaiolo, but not any more.  Not nearly as good and just as expensive for what you get. The only bargain is BYOB.  Sorry folks, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and fabulous pizza! When we arrived, we were seated immediately and given very personable service. The waitress gave us excellent suggestions and was very kind. By far, the Pizza Anna won the prize as the best food of the evening, though we ate the Antipasti and meatball appetizers as well, and they were delectable. The only thing that was missing was music, but we were happy to provide our own via pandora."}
{"text":"3times I've tried! Food was good but portions are skimpy! I had a chicken panini the last 2 times I came. There was a half of a half(1/4) of a chicken breast on the sandwich... Cheap! Chicken is not expensive guys! But I think the thing that was THE WORST are the waitresses! Just AWEFUL! Rude, no attention to detail, leave you after you order, don't fill drinks! I watched a woman get angry while she waited about 10min to even have the wait staff come around the corner to seat her while only 3 tables were full. Didn't realize the first time I came they only had pizza and the like here...when I asked if they had pasta I got attitude as if I should have known. I had 2 female waitresses and a male waiter the women were Bi***es! I should have left a ZERO tip! The male was much better and it looked to me the women were treating him with the same bi***y attitude! I hope your boss actually reads these reviews because your customer service sucks! Red headed pregnant female and long haired brunette!"}
