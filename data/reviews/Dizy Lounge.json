{"text":"I don't normally write reviews unless 1. I am amazed by the food or service or 2. I hated it and wouldn't mind telling the world not to ever waste your money.  Sadly, I'm going with the latter on this one. The only perk to this place is the atmosphere. Good job on the design.. But the service, my god.. I have never been so annoyed. TWO servers plus a manager and they only had to deal with our table and one other table.. 15 minutes for the water, 25 minutes for one of the four drinks we ordered and to top it off, they didn't bother telling us they didn't have a bartender and expected us to wait 25 minutes to get one drink anyone could make.   When we got fed up and wanted to pay for the nasty frozen cheesecake they brought us, their POS system was down.   At the end of this all, the manager didn't even bother apologizing nor did he even acknowledge that the only two tables present were not impressed.   Please don't waste your time or money on this place. I don't see them staying open for business for much longer."}
{"text":"We had lunch today dizy was awful my mom got food poisoning with vomiting and diarrhea after lunch ,we called the restaurant and explained them and they answered so rude without apology! Never will go there again and will tell all my friends how rude they were!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere  Great food Clean and well designed  Convenient parking area Spacious lounge Combination to a good time :)"}
{"text":"Way too loud music, expensive for ok-ish food, service is not fast.   I can't even hear what the person next to me is saying because they're trying to kill my ears. I like loud music when it's good! But not this loud ridiculous.   Food took a while. You may have to hunt down your waitress if they keep talking with other servers and employees for over 20min to order your food. Food is not good, can be bland, cold, sloppy presentation.   The only good thing about this place is its looks with cool lighting and modern furniture."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have persian food. The portions are very big. The cheese and herbs plate with bread is complimentary on the house. The only reason I'm giving a 4/5 is because the chicken kabob slices are cut too big (I prefer smaller slices)."}
{"text":"So very disappointed. Started with bread and tiny appetizer plate of parsley, feta and walnuts. The portion was tiny for three of us. Asked for more and a minuscule amount was brought out. Not very good Persian hospitality! Had Salad Shirazi which was fine. Ordered chicken breast kebab with rice. Chicken was moist and tender. That was the first piece, then, I found a hair in my meal and was totally turned off. I was asked if I wanted anything else, in Farsi, which I don't speak. The waitress sent out someone else who then asked me the same thing in Farsi. My husband told the manager that I don't speak Farsi, so she apologized and asked if I wanted anything else. I wasn't interested...at all. Definitely will NOT be returning...ever!"}
{"text":"I'll give this place a 4/5 for atmosphere. The decorations and ambience was really chill and comfortable. They lost one big point for the ridiculously loud volume. I'm at a bar, not a club- I want to be able to enjoy the sound effects and commentary while also chatting with my friends beside me. But they did turn it down later so I'll give them that.   They get a 3/5 for service. I originally was going to give 1/5 for service with our original blonde-haired waitress. I ordered three different drinks from the menu and she made me feel like I was making these drinks up! \"We don't serve those drinks\", was her response. \"No we don't serve any juices. Only tap.\" Tap? Like you only serve beer? It wasn't until later I realized she meant the bar gun juices (OJ and cranberry juice). Granted, I was ordering virgin drinks so perhaps she was confused by the concept but it confused ME when she said \"we don't have ANY juice\", to suddenly saying they did have juice \"but they didn't sell it separately\". What?? I can't have a virgin Bellini? A virgin daiquiri? Finally I explained to her that I was just asking for the drink on the menu... Minus the alcohol. Basically I ended up with thick strawberry purée with tooth-sized ice that made it impossible to enjoy my beverage. Our food took over 20 minutes to arrive. My half-blended fruit purée took 15 minutes to arrive. The industry standard is: Foods should get to the table in less than 15 minutes and drinks in 2-3 minutes.   I made my final rating a 3/5 and that's only because the amazing Asian waitress came in the middle of the messy night and saved the day and the owner was very nice and accommodating. She knows customer service and how to serve. When we ordered a second round of food, it took a while to come so the food lag might have to do with the kitchen.   Still, not completely impressed that this polite waitress had to hold it together for the original waitress. It's not fair to the establishment or the customers."}
{"text":"Their kebab Torsh andKebab Barg is really good. Much better than other persian places. Kashke Bademajn was good too. My mom had Koobideh and she was happy with it. Will try this place again."}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for something to eat. I walked by and saw pictures of their food on their window. So I thought lemme try it walking by.  Walked in, initially I think the girl who was working there was surprised I walked in. It was noon and no one else was there, I was in a suit, dunno if she thought I was selling something.  Sat near the window, and the atmosphere was nice and calm. Radio playing in the background to some 90s music. Place was clean.  I ordered the Dizy burger, and dear god was it a lot of food. Not only did I get the burger, but I got pita bread and some sorta cheese that was goooooooood. But for the burger, it was good. The burger was so large and a bit dry, but its okay. I actually had to leave food behind, something I don't like to do.  But generally, if you are in the area, its an okay attempt for lunchtime. Can't cay for other times of the day or week."}
{"text":"Pros: Our waitress was very friendly, and attentive to our table The food portions are big and they have many drink options on the drinks menu Downstairs is more classy than upstairs, but if watching sports in a dark sports pub is your thing, then you should go upstairs for the big screen and loud crowd.  Cons: The food is very mediocre. There's nothing special about their food that I can comment on. I tried their Special Fries, which is a poutine imitation with cheese and sour cream.The special pizza is not the typical Persian thick pizza, but rather thinner, and the kielbasa is not as good as Pizza night or Haida's in North York.  Also, I got a Mojito here and I didn't really like it. It was almost as if there is no alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Amazing bar/lounge. A truly uptown Gem. By far the best tasting pizza's in Toronto. Will definitely go back.  best place to Watch Leafs!"}
