{"text":"Food is AMAZING. Finally found healthy food that tastes good. Yes please. 

They do meal delivery too so just an FYI if you aren't in the area."}
{"text":"The fresh components that comprised the Thai Fighter w/chicken I ordered at their Rainbow location was the first thing I noticed. A good deal of thought went into this creation, even the textures involved within this wrap spoke volumes of the detail involved. They adequately blended all components to keep the flavors interesting. Like all great foods, consumption is immersion of flavor. For a quick clean bite, this place will leave your cravings satisfied and your conscience clear."}
{"text":"Used to be Fresh Mama downstairs of Vegas Hot!

I've tried the Thai Fighter wrap with chicken and it was delicious! It also came with a small kale salad which was a nice surprise. I might've liked the salad even more than the wrap. Getting the full size salad with chicken next time! 

Have not had a chance to try the smoothies here yet, but they sound really good, with a good balance of fruit and veggies in them. Next time!"}
{"text":"So, this little shop has seemed to cross over concepts/menus/managers soooo many times. Now, it is called the Chef's Fitness Kitchen and I had a very mediocre experience both times:

First time, I went pre-yoga (4:06) and I mentioned that I wanted to get a quick bite before my class at 4:30p. I was the only person in the place and I ordered the lettuce wraps right away. They took 18 minutes to come out! By that time, I had to scarf my food. I appreciate that items are made to order but it's 3 pieces of lettuce and a pile of chicken mixture on a plate. 

The second time, it was after a workout and a friend and I just wanted to get a smoothie. We waited a good 5+ minutes by the counter while the manager (?) chatted with a table. When we finally coughed loud enough to get her attention, she did apologize and offered us 1/2 off our bill. But the 2 smoothies we received (Banana bread and the Chocolate one) were both extremely watery. I've had some good smoothies there before, and those were not representative of that. And there's NO way I would have felt good about paying $8 a piece for those. 

Last note: when you're signing the square receipt on the tablet, it automatically suggests adding a certain gratuity. It's so uncomfortable if you don't tip, but it's a cafe with counter service.... You shouldn't be asked to tip!

Overall, disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. The first time I went AMAZING. Every time since problems. they keep saying they just opened and are trying to get everything together. Heres an idea. DON'T OPEN TILL YOUR READY. They are constantly having \"new staff\" problems and changing their menu 
I ask every time If the produce is organic sometimes they say yes. Today they said \"it's all fresh\" what does that have to do with organic? Also I order the smoothie with CACAO and see them put in COCOA a huge difference. 

I drive 25 mins to them because they have vegan options. Today is the second time they said \"chefs won't be in till later\" who opened a restraunt without a damn chef???? There going downhill as fast as fresh mama. Looking forward to them closing and reopening a real restraunt"}

If you don't see it on the menu, They say they will make you anything you want. :)"}
{"text":"Kale salad is delicious! Loved the food! Price is about the same as other healthy and good food but it's worth it and they try to do anything you ask for!! I'll be coming back here over and over again!!"}
{"text":"Wow  so delightful! Friendly staff, peaceful vibe in the kitchen, clean food that has actual FLAVOR  the menu doesn't do it justice, the food is beautiful  get the chef salad and ask for a side of steak it's absolutely divine"}
{"text":"Chef Kas has amazing, super healthy recipes! His Kale salad is the only Salad I like! It's so nice to eat at a restaurant where you trust the ingredients, the chef and the staff to feed you healthy food that's to crave for."}
{"text":"The healthiest and best smoothies! Organic, clean and green. Meat eaters can bring their vegan friends and everyone is happy! Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I just found this place and I am so stoked. The smoothies are awesome, they are not to sweet which is what bothers me about most smoothie places. While I didn't eat, the food looked and smelled amazing. I will be back."}
