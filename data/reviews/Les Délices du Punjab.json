{"text":"Trés bonne cuisine végétarienne et familiale. Excellent service avec beau sourire ! J'y retourne régulièrement."}
{"text":"One of the worst Indian food restaurants I've been to.  You expect Indian food to have strong, explosive flavors, but theirs is very bland and flavorless.  Ordered the daily special thali.  Everything on the dish tasted the same.  Chick peas tasted like they just came out of a can, rinsed, and thrown on the plate.  No flavor.  The \"curry\" was lacking curry."}
{"text":"Very good food. Super cheap. the   cashier/waitress is really nice and was very helpfull.   Going back again tonight :)"}
{"text":"Vegetarian food. I asked for vegan and they accommodated me with no fuss. Friendly service. Clean. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wow! Went here during August 2016! One of the best Punjabi restaurants I've ever tried outside India. Really delicious, fresh, and healthy. I know this is a small family owned cafe and not some fancy dining hall, but out of all Punjabi dhabas I've eaten outside India, this is amongst the best. The thali was delicious. Naans tasted a bit different from the naans I'm used to eating, but they were still hot and fresh. Even better, it's cheap and vegetarian too! Being a Punjabi myself, I've never been this impressed by a dhaba restaurant outside India."}
{"text":"My favourite samosa place in Montreal (not to mention pakoras). It's also a go-to place for Indian sweets, or to pick up some vegs for your side dishes when eating at home.   If you're eating at the restaurant (I almost always do take-out), the Thali is a good choice for the uninitiated - I recommend having the Bhatura (sort of a deep-fried bread - like a large puri) instead of the rice."}
{"text":"Cheap vegetarian Indian dish, great taste. This place is never too crowded and this is just fine with me. They offer amazing and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Montreal is THE place for good eats; but when you think of great neighbourhoods to grab a bite, Lasalle doesn't often (or ever, frankly) come to mind.  Lately there are some locations making their mark in this neighbourhood, and one of them is Punjab.  I have to put it out there: I'm not vegetarian, the sound of that word kinda makes me vurp a litttle each time I hear it, but Punjab will bring even the most adament carnivore to their knees.  I have always gone in for the daily thali: a threesome of various vegetarian curries, served with rice and cabbage salad and naan at a very affordable price.  Like most Indian fare the food is like a warm blanket wrapped around the soul on a blustery winter's night, it doesn't just taste good, it feels good!  I have also had the paneer korma which is just so sooo good.  Next we have the sweets.  I've never been big on Indian desserts but at Punjab, I always walk in saying I won't buy sweets and usually submit to the urge and walk out with a box of various yum yums (the mango balls... OMG).  The lady behind the counter is so nice and very proficient.  She always recognises us, knows our regular order, tempts me with the sweets, and is happy to explain each item that needs explaining.    The food can usually be on the spicier side but as far as Indian food goes, this place is not to be missed! Price, quality, service are all 5 star.  A step up from the original Pushap brand for sure!"}
{"text":"super friendly family run vegitarian restaurant.  I usually have the thali (daily plate) with has a nice variety and served with rice and choice of bread (nan parata etc. ). everything is made fresh and really flavourful.  there is a sweet counter with the most colorful array of indian goodies. great samosas too."}
{"text":"Went here once long time ago, I did not know the place was exclusively vegetarian, but the food tasted really good.  There was barely any service, and most of the restaurant's business consists of takeouts and deliveries. I would suggest takeouts instead of eating there."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner from this place and i never knew it existed, but i am over the moon that I found it! From the moment we walked in, it felt right. It's a small and quaint family run restaurant that seats about 30 people. The waitress (the owners daughter) was amazing, she explained everything, made suggestions based off of what we were interested in and provided us with an exceptional service! The food was great, very typical and traditional tasting and bursting with flavor. The food arrived really quickly and she told us that the thali plate changes every day, so you can go often and get to try new things :)  Not only would I would back for the great food, but I would go back to support this great quaint family run restaurant that makes you feel at home in their establishment.   I also forgot, but their prices are so affordable...i mean 6$ for a thali plate!"}
{"text":"Went here once thinking that it would be similar to the Pare location at Namur metro. It was closer to home at the time so I figured I'd give it a try.The location was much more difficult to get to. No metro near by, had to take a car to get there.   Service was odd. We were served by two children under the ages of fifteen who had been doing homework at one of the tables when we walked in.  We were the only one's in the restaurant.    We ordered or food and when it came out it was still very good quality Indian food (comparable to the other Pushap) however it was definitely not warm enough.   We enjoyed the experience but it was odd that there were no adults to be seen!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and fantastic service. This restaurant has only gotten better since they broke from the \"Pushap\" brand and renamed themselves to \"Les Delices de Punjab\"."}
{"text":"The name had indeed changed to Punjab. It's the same family as before. The daughter always remembers you and your favourite dish. The food is very tasty and strictly vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! One of the best in Montreal.  Great selection of sweets.   What makes it unique is that the entire menu is vegetarian. We were 6 sharing a variety of dishes to go. A few found the spice level too much, but if you're not too sensitive to spice then it's perfect. It has become my go-to Indian take out place."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I usually go for the thali daily special. The staff is very friendly. The spinach and paneer meal is the best."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the staff extremely friendly. One of my fav's!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try this restaurant. I was greeted upon arrival. The restaurant is well maintained and clean. I took a Thali which is always a great option if you're not sure on what to get but want to try a little bit of everything. Overall, it was good. I like the naan bread, the mixed vegetables and the cheese sauce. I also really liked the mango lassi. It's a must !  This restaurant has vegetarian food options for the entire family."}
{"text":"Quel service! L'accueil est chaleureux, invitant. Tout est bien expliqué dans un français ou anglais impeccable avec une simplicité sans pareil. L'endroit est chaleureux et familial.  La nourriture est délectable. Elle donne envie d'adopter le végétarisme. Belle variété d'aliments frais et savoureux. Les prix sont aussi très justes. Il faut être patient quand on commande, mais c'est peu cher payer pour avoir un service aussi personnalisé et de la nourriture fraichement préparé. Nous y retournerons... Souvent!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian family restaurant. Have kids and adults platter! Love the variety of desserts choices!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur spot pour un \"craving\" de bouffe indienne. L'endroit est impeccable et le service est hors pair. J'y vais régulièrement pour dîner et j'en ressort toujours satisfait."}
