{"text":"This is less a shop and more just a coffee kiosk with tables in the middle of the mall.

I've come here to meet clients a few times. The service is always friendly, there are usually tables available and there is a bit of privacy as most of the tables are booths.  Plus, unrestricted wifi with no password necessary. It's slow, though. Slower than tethering my phone."}
{"text":"They get the 2 stars at this location for the actual coffee, which is my absolute favourite chain brand for flavour brewed coffee. It's smooth, not at all bitter, lovely flavoured coffee, if you like flavour brewed. That's the best part of this mall kiosk location on today's visit. Hadn't been here for a while and the service was horrible. I wanted to redeem my free birthday baked good with purchase of coffee. The cashier had no clue, which is fine when the other staff is helping out, but they were absolutely confounded by my wanting a large coffee instead of the medium purchase required for the free birthday baked goody. The cashier's only concern was being annoyed and making herself scarce while the barista looked after my not having received my credit card receipt. The cinnamon bun was also a disappointment. More like a rolled up piece of croissant type pastry with hardly any cinnamon except for a dab in the centre, and the lamest excuse for icing which was not only barely existent, the fact that it was like a dot of dry, heavy, tasteless, gluey blob of sugary fondant made it just as well there hardly was any. I still adore that coffee, but I'll go to any one of their other locations instead."}
{"text":"I like Timothy's. I like their flavored coffee. I find most mall kiosk Timothy's are cesspits straight from the mouth of hell. Dirty. Certified Coffee Agents who do not take their position or societal role seriously. You have to hunt for the napkins. And there's always some old guy in a Greek Fisherman cap trying to pick up on women half his age. 

But this one is okay."}
