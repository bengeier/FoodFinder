{"text":"Winterlicious 2016  You won't find Crème Basserie if you're just walking along the main roads as it is located along a pedestrian walkway close to Avenue. I didn't really have any expectations when coming to Crème Basserie as I haven't heard of this restaurant and I'm not overly fond of Summerlicious/Winterlicious. However, after eating from the Winterlicious menu and the main menu (we were exceptionally hungry), I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the food here.   I ordered the grilled calamari, Cornish hen and the chocolate crepes from the Winterlicious menu. The steak frites entrée was quite small, but feedback was that it tasted nice.  - Calamari: tasted fresh and was refreshing to finally not have soggy or rubbery squid that you often get elsewhere - Hen: cooked extremely well, was juicy and the portion was good for a Winterlicious dish - Chocolate crepe: not the best crepe I've ever had, but it was still pretty good. Probably more impressive than the crème brulee that is another dessert option.   The pork belly appetizer that we also ordered was melt-in-your-mouth and incredibly flavourful.    I think this restaurant does well with their Winterlicious menu as it definitely showcases good execution and great ingredients without breaking the bank. \"Yay! I'm a fan.\""}
{"text":"Had a lovely and pleasant Summerlicious dinner. Very attentive servers and super friendly staff/ owner(s)? kept coming by to check on us. Food was delicious! Nice atmosphere and decor, quiet location (away from street traffic). I was most pleased with the service, it was excellent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, service and food were great.   Came here for Summerlicious 2012. Price was $20 for lunch.   Cant beat the location- right in the heart of Yorkville in a nice little courtyard. We sat in the patio and people watched. Service was friendly though it got busy and the wait staff seemed overwhelmed. The best part though was the food. I rated it as follows:  Salmon Tartare - 5/5 - wow Stuffed Salmon - 4/5 Parfait - 4/5  THe portions were substantial (although, friends who had the bass entree thought it was like half a portion) and priced well considering the location and quality.   This is a place I'd consider coming back to even after Summerlicious."}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant many times as I live in the neighborhood. I finally decided to try it out. The service was amazing. Courteous, attentive and we were never rushed. It was summerlicious - a time where many restaurants fail in the service department. The appetizer and dessert were great. The main was meh. But, the service and wine list made up for it. My main was only on the summerlicious menu (not the regular menu) so perhaps it was more of an experimental dish. Overall - I think I will make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"A nice quiet restaurant in Yorkville, super friendly service and food was filling and tasty.  Their dessert was great as well."}
{"text":"Went here with a wedding party during Winterlicious 2013.  The place is quite elegant, and the location easily accessible yet hidden from the main street.  Every dish I tried was a pleasant surprise, and everyone was quite happy.  The service was outstanding, everyone worked with a smile.  The owner (or co-owner?) even came to check on us a few times, offering his best wishes.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Booked a late lunch for summerlicious. Sat in the open patio which is nice with big umbrella to give you shade. Started off with a ice brewed sweet tea (too watery) and a sunrise drink (too watery as well).  Ordered the chilled tomato soup that had little pieces of avocado and lil crab meat hidden in there with a hint of lemon grass. This soup taste good for a hot summer day. My gf had the salmon tartare with salty crouton to accompany the salmon tartare. It was a good portion considering for summerlicious.  Main meal I got the sea bass with steam veggies, it was crispy skin outside and I was able to cut thru with a fork. My gf had the stuffed salmon with spinach leek and fingerling potatoes and tomato. The first time she dug in, there was a piece of long hair which they replaced with a fresh new fish! I have to say that her dish was better filling than mine.  Desserts: I had the mixed berry parfait (normal tasting) but healthy I assume. My gf had the pineapple which didn't taste roasted which would enhance the flavour of this fruit for sure.  Our server was very friendly and kind in bringing us bread refill and taking a photo of us. I would say this place gets a 4/5!  1x star for nice patio and ambiance of the restaurant 1x star for nice apps starter 1x star for nice waiter replacing my gf main meal with a new fish! 1x  star for server not being rush service and allowed us to enjoy our time there! Why not perfect goes to the dessert not being great, and my main meal, but nevertheless left a generous tip for the service!  I would come back and try their regular lunch menu or their 3p-4p special which has half price stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful setting for family birthday - a year ago Crème Brasserie was the setting for my father's 80th birthday. When we told my mom we wanted to throw a similar celebration for her 80th she requested that we book Crème Brasserie!  Ricardo and Ricardo arranged a beautiful lunch for about 25. They are very easy to work with, very straight forward and accommodating. Reasonable pricing. Really, what's not to like?  Nice patio as well.  Have a family gathering or other celebration? Check out Crème Brasserie."}
{"text":"Had the Ned-rare flank off the summerlicious menu. It was cooked exactly the way I like it. The outdoor patio on a cool day was perfect.   Overall me and my friends really like this place!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best meal I've had with my family ever. Ricardo the chef wowed our kids with what is possible with chicken. My wife was amazed at how dates and salmon can work together. I was amazed as usual by the wine.  After three dinners here I can also tell you the consistency is fantastic.  Finally even my kids appreciated the service. They felt like they were royalty.  Need anything more need be said?"}
{"text":"Reallly yummy food and a quick service. One of our friends were running late so we took time to order, but they never made a fuss abt it even though the restaurant was almost full for the whole time. quantity was a lil less but i do have a big stomach lol. amazing desserts and appertizers suprisingly."}
{"text":"Great service and good food. We went there for lunch and the prices were pretty reasonable given the high class atmosphere. Try the lemon cake- it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great Food.  Great Service.  Great ambiance.  Lovely outdoor patio. A little expensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This was an indescribable culinary experience. I brought out my girlfriend for her birthday dinner. The service was impeccable. Extremely warm and attentive. The menu was inventive and inviting. We shared oysters, grilled octopus and both deeply enjoyed the filet. Cooked to perfection. I would highly recommended the creme brasserie. Wonderful culinary adventure."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicous, the menu was delicous, especially the meat reductions they use. I've had duck confit in Paris, and this one is comparable. The raspberry ice cream dessert was rich and creamy, one of the best I had.  Service was top notch: polite, warm and welcoming staff. I loved the family atmosphere of this restaurant, which seems rare for those with high end French cuisine."}
{"text":"I had a dinner voucher for here: 3-course meal for 2. It was a really good value, this place had good reviews -- so I decided to jump on it.   I am SO happy that I did. We came here on night on the weekend, it was busy, but we made reservations ahead of time. We were the youngest couple in the room, but that was alright because our waitress was very pleasant with us.   We started off with the Salmon Mousse. It was alright, too fishy tasting for my liking. For the entree, I had the Filet mignon. It was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal; cooked to perfection.  For dessert, we shared the creme brulee. I am very very picky when it comes to creme brulee, and this did not disappoint. The top was torched just before being served, which made it crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.   I believe it was the manager that served us our entrees. I saw him serve nearly every table's entrees and say goodbye to everyone when they left. He was very friendly and took pride in his work.   The food was great, would I say it's the best in the city? I'm not sure, but it comes pretty close. The service was excellent, some of the best service I've experienced in Toronto. I highly recommend this place, prices are on par with the rest of Yorkville and the food does not disappoint."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Everything's that great about an upscale French restaurant, without the snobby attitude you would find in Paris. A+.  Came here on New Year's Eve at 7pm with my family. We had the New Year's Eve $49 tasting menu - appetizer, main, and dessert. Place got busier throughout the night but service was always spot-on.  SERVICE: 10/10 Waiters were very warm and genuine from the moment we walked in the door, and struck the perfect balance between attentive and not being overbearing. Our family tried all the options from the tasting menu and they were very accomodating about bringing us all sharing plates and extra utensils, without any hint of snobbery (try doing that in a Parisian restaurant if you want to see the most contemptuous sneers possible).  FOOD: 8.5/10 We tried all the items on the New Year's Eve menu: butternut squash soup/salad/pork belly for appetizer (all fantastic), steak/lamb/salmon for the main (also all fantastic), and crème brulée/chocolate mousse/raspberry sorbet for the dessert (least favourite part of the meal, but still on point and quite delicious).   All dishes came promptly and together. Portion sizes felt perfect: we had room for dessert, and left feeling full.  DECOR/PLACE/PARKING: 10/10 Decor inside and outside is beautiful, elegant, and very romantic. They will validate your parking ticket for two hours of free parking in the Renaissance Court parking lot on Cumberland Street, and the restaurant is on the ground floor, just outside the elevators.  Overall, a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the Summerlicious menu on a Saturday night.  It's in a quaint little location just tucked away in a condo courtyard, and sitting down on the patio you get the outdoor feel, but it's not as hot and you get more privacy than in other patios.  The patio was quiet around 7 but by 9 it was comfortably full, and the service was attentive, albeit a bit disorganized as they had different staff doing different duties over the course of the service, as well as trainees on the job.  I had the gazpacho with goats milk yogurt to start which was delicious and refreshing with a bit of kick in the chili, while others had the watermelon salad which was also delicious.  The mains were the weakest part of the service, as the flank steak was quite tough and came cooked in strips as well as being full of connective tissue making it hard to cut.  The curry lemon chicken was tasty and tender, but it did not seem to go well with the curry sauce.  The side slaw was the highlight of that dish.  Dessert was the Irish crème mousse and a banana split dish.  The mousse was quite delicious, and the banana split looked good as well."}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant! I had a celebration here and made reservations for 20 with ease. They were extremely accommodating, let us bring our own cake and served it to us too! The service was amazing. They were so polite, funny, friendly and went out of their way to make our special night even more perfect. The ambience was very romantic, warm and cozy. Would be an amazing date spot. I had the salmon and it melted in my mouth. It was so flavorful, one of the best I've ever had. I am definitely coming back to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"We have recently gone out for a romantic dinner at Creme Brasserie. The restaurant is tucked away in a cute courtyard in Yorkville, and has a very pleasant atmosphere. The food is not cheap, but was very tasty - I must say the scallops were cooked to perfections, the best ones I've ever tried! The service was impeccable, too. Will come again when the occasion is right to splurge!"}
{"text":"Beautiful quiet setting away from the main strip of Yorkville. The only inclusion was there was construction occurring at the Hyatt. The service and food was above average. Perhaps it was a quiet afternoon on a Saturday, but servers were extremely attentive and accommodating. We even made a special request of a simple Vegetarian Penne with White Wine sauce and Chef delivered exceeding expectations. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just ate here on the weekend for Winterlicious. Like in most restaurants, I thought we'd get the Winterlicious second class treatment...however it was quite the opposite. We were treated like total royalty. The food was amazing also. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"We've been going to Creme for many years and really enjoy the food and the great service. The staff makes you feel more like family then a customer. Our children (ages 8 and 12) love to go to this restaurant more than any other in the city. They are big fans of the rack of lamb and my son who is usually a picky eater, orders the calamari and braised lamb shank. Creme has by far the best patio in Yorkville, tucked away in the middle of the heart of the city. No small portions here either (unlike most French restuarants). Great place for all occasions. Upscale but not pretentious....a gem that we've certainly recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I have walked past it numerous times and always made a mental note to go. sooo it was a very pleasant surprise to see it turn up on the summerlicious menu.  It is a great people watching location.   appy salmon tartar-5/5 entree salmon-5/5 dessert grilled pineapple with Greek yogurt-3/5 nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"My sentiments are similar to those of Cindy H earlier.  We went with a Travelzoo coupon.  Would we go back?  Not at full price.  It's expensive for food, but part of the price definitely goes towards rent.  Service: Good to start, but they're understaffed.  We got little attention later in the meal and things took longer than they should have.  Ambience: Nice.  Modern.  Wine: It's ok.  We had one glass expensive, one glass not as expensive.  They tasted very similar.  Generous on the glass portions.  Oysters Rockefeller: Salty.  They added too much salt.  The oysters were small and a bit fishy.  Very underwhelming for a Rockefeller, definitely the bottom end of what I've had of Rockefellers.  Rabbit Fricasee: Nice.  It's a good solid dish and a healthy portion.  Tasty.  Bass special: Skin nicely grilled, and the meat was soft.  A nice consomme broth underneath made the dish.  Tasty.  Molten chocolate cake: Menu says 15 minutes, but took 25.  If it took that long, it's no surprise that it wasn't all that runny."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant in terms of ambiance and decor but the food was not what I expected. I went for a weeknight Winterlicious dinner:  1st course: Pickled Fig and Brie Crostini  - 3 large crostini with a generous amount of brie and fig. Not bad, a bit too oily though, I had oil dripping as I bit into it.  Main: Root Vegetable Tart - Pretty disappointed with this. I expected the tart to be a pastry shell filled with vegetables, but it ended up being a stack of thinly sliced beets and squash? Not very good at all and not filling either.   Dessert: Chocolate Crepe - My favourite part of the meal, the crepe was light and the filling was tasty, strawberries and banana. Good end to the sub par meal. Funny thing happened, when the crepe was brought out, mine didn't have a garnish and the waitress ended up bringing it separately, just a single cut up strawberry.. weird."}
{"text":"With our Travelzoo voucher for a 2-person dinner, we arrived around 6:00pm and were seated immediately, with a very friendly waiter.  For appetizers, we chose the escargot and grilled shrimp cocktail. Both plates were a big hit. The escargot was prepared in a delicious sauce. The shrimp was grilled to perfection and quite large in serving size.  We ordered the scallops and 6 oz filet mignon for our entrees. We found the wait time to be quite long between the appetizer and entree course, as more customers started arriving. When the food did arrive, both the scallops and steak were cooked nicely.  The wait for dessert took even longer. Interestingly enough, the 2 servers were also responsible for making drinks behind the bar. I think this really slowed up the service. The Manager did a good job of pitching in, but it also became apparent who the high profile clients were.  We shared the creme brulee for dessert. Although the top sugar coating was crispy, the inside was quite cold, specifically the blueberries. I guess we were expecting it to be a bit warmer, seeing as it took a while to arrive.  We found the experience seemed to go downhill as dinner progressed. Overall, we were satisfied but not sure there's a desire to return, especially at Yorkville prices."}
{"text":"We are a family of five foodies who are almost never all satisfied with a dinner out. Happily, all five of us loved our dinner there on December 30th while visiting Toronto. Appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all delicious and the wine list and drinks were good too. We all especially loved the fresh bread delivered to our table by our waiter who attended to our needs in every way.  Highly recommend it! We will return when we visit again this summer."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here during summerlicious 2016. The fish was amazing, the most tender, melt in your mouth, bass I've had in a long time, and the sauce it came in was heavenly! The dessert crepe was delicious as well. Was not impressed with the appetizer selection during this year's summerlicious, wish they offered just a normal salad with some kind of greens, but overall a great experience and everyone in our group was happy with their meals."}
{"text":"Not worth the time and money. Go for a place that can accommodate 20+ people in a group. Don't go for innovative food, execution, or any semblance of premiere service."}
{"text":"a very nice high end restaurant. would probably not go there on regular terms but got a nice deal through travelzoo so gave this place a try.   it's hidden in small alley in yorkville so you wouldn't get here by accident I don't think so. I'd think you need to know of it in advance.   the view is to the alley so not the superbest for the type of the restaurant.   however having said all that, the service was superb (maybe the fact that there were only few other customers helped) and I got an impression that it was the restaurant's owner serving us but maybe it's just an impression.   the vegetarian menu is scarce... only one dish. but they're ready to create anything from scratch to your liking and taste. I ordered the veg tarte from the menu. layers of beet, sweet potato, asparagus, comemebert cheese and few more vegetables and an amazing sauce created an amazing combination. all for $26 so not even that bad.  Dessert with hazelnut cream and caramel was heavenly amazing.  I loved the experience. highly recommended."}
{"text":"To be fair, I am not a huge French Cuisine fan, and my friend brought me to this restaurant.  So for somebody who is not a huge French Cuisine fan, this restaurant was pretty good. For apps, my friend had the steak tartar (which was a large portion!) and I had the smoked duck salad.  For mains my friend had the lamb shank and I had the rabbit.   I had never had rabbit before so I thought I would give it a try it, and it was good.  I have had a bunch of friends tell me how awesome rabbit tastes, but I found that it was just okay, nothing mind blowing.  But overall, everything tasted very good and the service was absolutely impeccable.  That was one thing that really stuck out.  From the person that opened the door, the man that took my jacket, the server, everybody was absolutely genuinely nice, happy, and made the experience of the restaurant memorable.  I increased my rating from 4 stars from 3 because it's not the restaurant's fault that I am not a French food fan, and the service was really absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"The meal was decent. Very typical French bistro... But what you really need to know... Best espresso that I have had in a long time...  Also, if you order sparkling water... They charge by the bottle but only give you a glass. That was not well done creme brasserie. I was not a happy customer.   Side note, our waiter was cute. B rated actor worthy..."}
{"text":"Got here for a late lunch (3pm) after spending all morning at the ROM w a very hungry 7 year old. Waiter was extremely accommodating, but the chef in the back was rude to him... The poor guy came and apologized several times for items no longer available.  The food was actually good! The seafood was very fresh and I particularly enjoyed the lobster crepè."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant several times, and the service is always top notch and the food is incredible. Questions about the menu were taken with genuine interest and the staff never overlook even the smallest detail.   The steak frites is not to be missed. I strongly recommend stopping in for either summerlicious or winterlicious as the menus are creative and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations for this place.  The food was good but not great.  Inside the restaurant they were playing gypsy kings type music (without the singing) which is an odd choice for a French restaurant.  Seafood crepe was too salty.  Mixed greens had berries in it which is a nice touch for the hot weather. Steak frites was average.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"The onion soup and lamb were excellent. The short ribs were good too. I found the house salad a litle overdressed. My husband found his medium lamb to be more medium-rare than medium. They were playing French music when we arrived, which was appropriate. But then it switched to loud pop music which we found inappropriate for dinner and certainly a French cafe. They had no issue with changing the music when I asked."}
{"text":"I'd go back :) ....only for the patio !  Beautiful little patio and breezy place to enjoy a summer evening and Summerliciois dinner . The experience, more than the food, is what I enjoyed.   - melon salad: fresh, perfectly flavoured with a honey fig dressing, and ribbons of mint and feta crumbles. Very high on pretty factor - rosemary and grape crostini- big portion! - octopus stew: never had octopus this tender. The stew tasted a bit musty, but I really enjoyed the textures. - pineapple crepes: I'd go back just to have these as an afternoon dessert with coffee."}
{"text":"I have been at Creme for business, so we were a bit in a hurry and probably did not have all the time to enjoy fully the restaurant. They have a french/canadian cuisine menu, I found the place to be very nice for its location, as it's in the middle of an \"inner street\" and there aren't many people passing by. Food was good, price a little less good, but we are near Bloor Street and there is an extra cost to be in such upscale part of town."}
{"text":"Among one of the best spots for a romantic dinner date!!! The ambience is dim, surrounded by warm color decor,  classy yet modern.  Creme has the ability to exhibit its  image and  culinary french dishes with some hint of Moroccan flare. During the summer months they have a courtyard patio section, so hence I will need to make a second visit.  Winterlicious has provided GTA'er and Torontonians the opportunity to try some of Toronto's renouned restaurants. Hence Creme was on my list.  Wait staff, food, and prices are reasonable, keeping in mind you're in Yorkville!!  Rillette of Rabbit  served with Balsamic mustard, sweet onion jam, olives and homemade toast!! delighful great mixture of flavors, a bit of sweet and sour!! great way to kick off a meal 5/5  Fricasse of Rabit; for something more robust full of flavor I'd recommend the Lamb.  The fricasse was a nice medley of smoked bacon celery mushroom purree tossed in white wine, great to try for those who've never had rabbit. Tasted like chicken but again its white meat. 4/5  Poached Pears! by far the best & refreshing with the raspberry syrup over the vanilla ice cream and pear. I preferred their poached pears over Midi Bistro's. Its light, yet savory, and not too heavy.    Overall we had an excellent experience, the waiter was very kind, accommodating, and knowledgable about the menu.    Tres Bien! Creme! I shall see you when the weather gets better to experience their outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Family and I go to this place on a regular basis. We are never disappointed always good food for the price compared to other  similar restaurants in the area. Bigger portions you feel fool after eating the exquisite French bistro meals."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic! A Local gem. Watermelon and Feta salad had me mm-mmming the entire time. Atmosphere and service great. Try it; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am extremely upset about your service. I booked at least two weeks in advance for winterlicious. A week after, i receive and email informing me my reservation is cancelled. No problem, I assume maybe there was a problem.  I book again, and receive another confirmation email.  Today, 5 minutes ago, i receive another email regarding the cancellation. I follow by calling the restaurant, the first person that answer is courteous and apologizes and books me another reservation. I was content.  Then after, a call back, from Ricardo, informing me that I am at fault, because I had booked it twice! I most certainly did not book it twice. On my open table it showed that I had no reservations for this restaurant. Thus, I call in to inquire. He refused to accept that there was a glitch, or that this was what I saw on my side! I didn't even say that, that's not what appeared on the restaurant. I was happy that I still had a reservation. However, he kept insisting that it was MY problem and seemed to be waiting for me to apologize.    I assume now it's enough for me to be frustrated. This restaurant will never have my business and i will definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Didn't love it, sorry.  Pros: great location, ambiance and service. Exceptional complimentary bread and hummus.  Sadly, the food didn't impress us that much. We went for Mother's Day lunch and ordered:  Cobb salad - a fairly dainty portion, especially for $21....also, the avocado was brown Mushroom crepe - okay but nothing great Lobster crepe (special) - didn't like it at all...had to send it back Steak frites - steak was fine but I've had better frites Fried calamari - probably the best of the bunch  IMHO."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious lunch and was a good experience.    For first course I got the Stracciatella (Light Chicken Broth, Parmesan Cheese, Egg Drops, And Mini Meat Balls). Broth was good, chicken was dry, didn't like the meatballs.  I tried my friends Pickled Fig And Triple Cream Brie Crostini and it was ok.    For second course I got Striped Bass (Pan Seared, Double Smoked Bacon, Cauliflower, And Parsnip Puree, Wilted Greens, Beets, And A Leek And Corn Froth).  There were many different flavours and textures throughout this dish which I liked.  Was hoping for crispier skin on fish and I got a couple of bones and scales that I had to spit out.   For third course I got Chocolate Crepes (Strawberries, Bananas, Caramel, Cointreau).  Crepes tasted ok; fruits were cooked until they were soft and sweet which I liked.  Overall was a good meal.  Service was quick and very friendly.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"To round off Summerlicious 2016, my friend and I visited Crème Brasserie, a little French restaurant tucked away in Yorkville. It was sweltering hot and we had walked from Bloor station, so we were disappointed to hear that there were no more tables indoors, but I'm glad that we were able to enjoy their adorable patio. I genuinely felt like I was in a café in Paris, with bright floral accents amongst the foliage, elegant patio furniture, and accordion music in the background.   The waitress who initially seated us seemed so unenthused about her job, so I was prepared for mediocre service. Thus I was pleasantly surprised when our order was taken by a passionate gentleman (who looked a lot like George Lopez and may have been the owner). He took care of us for the rest of our time at the restaurant, and his cheery demeanour really made a difference.  From the $23 lunch menu, I ordered 1 | Melon & Feta Salad (vegetarian) Ribbons of cantaloupe, fresh mint, watermelon, feta cheese, white balsamic drizzle 2 | White Riesling Coq au vin Panko crusted organic chicken gently braised in Alsatian riesling with roasted seasonal vegetables 3 | Classic Crème Brûlée Classic vanilla custard, burnt sugar crust  Personally my meal tasted good, but nothing was super impressive. They brought up the wrong dessert for me, and the owner was very nice about replacing it within just a few minutes.   It's always nice to visit Yorkville once in a while, and I'm happy that we chose to visit Crème Brasserie."}
{"text":"My girl friend and I were there for full course, starters, entree, and dessert.  Foods(esp. steak and bass) were great and dessert was mediocre.  Great decoration along with excellent service!  Not to mention price was also reasonable for French Cuisine.   I would come again in the future."}
{"text":"We came just for dessert, seeking out their creme brulee, but learned that they had sold out earlier that night. He lemon tart was good,though the crust left something to be desired. Oddly, the music did not match the fine dining decor. Instead it was Simon and Garfunkel and some other oldies. The menu did look good, and we would certainly return for a full course meal. Wait staff was very friendly too."}
{"text":"My husband insisted on taking me out to dinner to cheer me up after a really tough day and Creme was somewhere we have been meaning to try for a long time. Tucked away in the courtyard behind the Four Seasons, I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this restaurant was. The ambiance was very warm and romantic. I had the Brandade to start which was sumptuous, followed by the strip which now looking back, wish I would have tried something more unique from the mains, but none the less, the steak was great. Having a sweet tooth, I couldn't resist the warm chocolate crepes for dessert. Filled with banana and strawberry and topped with rich chocolate sauce, this warm and gooey dessert was served with home made bourbon ice cream and was perfect for sharing. It truly was delightful on the palette. There's nothing more comforting than a fabulous meal. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Ahh man I dunno the music is really good just like my washroom break music sorta soothing and chirpy. And yeah would be better if they have wifi here you know cuz I like to watch YouTube while eating. I like he water tho really watery and the soup is soupyyyyyy. I wish they could have bigger candles tho looks epic you know and i can see my girl through the fireeeeeeeee yaaaaaaay. Oh and my waiter is so nice he looks like a cat"}
{"text":"In Toronto with my hubby    He has a meeting and dropped me off to run around Bloor st shopping.   So hungry I couldn't go on until I found a Cream French bistro and voila!  Fantastic  French onion soup and dab blank at the bar.  The also started with complimentary house made hummus and French bread.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, albeit insanely salty (chugged 3 bottles of water through the day after my lunch.) Service was great, as they kept re-loading out table with their fresh bread and awesome garlic hummus spread.   I am pretty salt sensitive so that's not a strike for this restaurant at all, because I've finally found a burger that has the meat patty SEASONED instead of bland cardboard ground meat at every other single restaurant that serves burgers. It was juicy and funkin huge, I mean, this patty was like a pound of straight up meaty goodness topped with melty cheddar slice (mmmmm melty) and fresh onions, lettuce, a tomato and just enough pickles. Served on a wonderful fluffy brioch bun.  And let me once again underline how big this burger is, I straight up had to pound this thing down, and I have a bit of a freakazoid Steven Tyler mouth (I constantly amaze myself with how much food I can shove in there and how I haven't choked yet...) and eating this Sirloin Burger gracefully was a HUGE challenge. I managed though, with my Mick Jagger mouth and all. It was flipping delicious and worth the 15 dollars. Unfortunately I didn't make a mark on my frites since the burger was insanely filling, but they were...fritey...if fritey is what you want. FRITES.  Also had their grilled octopus appetizer, which was good, but nothing to write home about. I found their pairing of grilled octopus on top of fingerling potatoes to not really have that zesty flavor, it was well seasoned but I would have loved a touch of acidity to have accompanied my octopus. The grilled octopus had a great charred note, it was fresh, and I love me some octopus tentacles. And I know, you're like \"Wtf ew Anna, OCTOPUS? THAT IS STANK.\" But you guys, octopus is THE BOMB DOT COM. Baby octopus can take it or leave it, cause I ain't putting that in my mouth. But grilled octopus is where it's at. I'd describe grilled octopus as a mix between chicken and lobster. Which are 2 of my fav proteins. So like, octopus is a really dreamy combo of texture and flavor for me.  basically what I'm saying is everyone should try octopus. Even my 12 year old sister who is scared of almost all foods liked it!"}
{"text":"IT WAS AWESOMEEEEEEEE E   waiter was so jolly   their wine book has like 20 pages but they wrote out the flavors of the wine so you know that some some taste like raspberries or blackberries and some taste like leather LOL   quiet pretty setting   the food was all really good - the pickled fig appetizer was   SEE PICS FOR PROOF :D"}
{"text":"food too salty?just look good. feel so diaappoint about this restaurant. but the environment and service are good"}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy place. Have been there with my friend for a quick lunch, but will for sure come by for dinner. Reminded me of Paris and France overall. Amazinf staff and people."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place.  It was sort of tucked out of the way in an walkway between Yorkville and Cumberland.  It was the only restaurant with good reviews with a last minute table for 3 on OpenTable on a Saturday night at 8:30p.  It was small and quiet--kind of romantic I suppose.  We had the roast chicken and salmon with 1/2 dozen raw oyster starters.  The food was Devine.  We chased it with a very reasonably priced bottle of California Cab.  All in the check was only $100.  Now that's what I call value.  For food and service like that in Yorkville you can bet I will be back.  Pssst--don't tell anyone!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Your typical Yorkville affair - it's good value...if you're paying to be seen. (Food was 3-STARS)  I came here as part of a work event so I was spared the financial grief of settling the bill. Tucked inside a walkway between Cumberland and Yorkville, this place is easy to miss. The inside was classically decorated and the service was attentive.  They first brought out the HOUSE SALAD (fairly standard greens though nice goat cheese), ROMAINE SALAD (meh, fairly bland) and the MANGO & ARUGULA CAPRESE (my favourite of the salads with fantastic buffalo mozzarella) to start. There was also a FENNEL TEMPURA or something like that that was light and crispy.  Then came the mains. I ordered the SEAFOOD CAPELLINI (which was very disappointing with very little seafood), while my DC ordered the ROAST CHICKEN (looked nice and juicy), the STEAK FRITES (didn't get a chance to ask about it, but it was a big piece of steak!),  and the SCALLOPS (minimalistic presentation with nice large oysters).  Finally, they brought out their Creme Brulee, which given the name of the resto, was somewhat disappointing. My DCs enjoyed the glazed topping but found it way to custardy and heavy for their liking. Overall, I wasn't terribly impressed , though could see myself coming back in the summer for an afternoon bevvy."}
{"text":"For the price and rating, I expected better. The steak was super dry even though I asked for medium rare and even though I was one of the two tables there they took forever to bring us our entrees. I felt it wasn't up the pricing standard. Probably a better coffee house than a valentines day lunch"}
{"text":"Lovely gem of a place. Almost didn't write a review cause this is one of yorkville' best kept secrets and I dream of keeping it that way... but in the spirit of a generous new year   Amazing steak tartare with raw quail egg   Fresh and generously portioned calamari (topped with chorizo!)   So-so filet mignon, BUT top-notch steak frites   The house gave us a port each to end the meals and to thank us for coming in on a cold night. Way to my culinary heart!!  Will have to return  to the  The Cornish hen  The sea bass  The crême brûlée  ... all recommended by our kind waiter, Andre   Merci"}
{"text":"I've always been skeptical about the Summer & Winterlicious events because most of my dining experiences at participating restaurants have always left me wanting more... more food (portion & quality-wise) and more customer service.  I left Creme Brasserie with a happy tummy and a big smile on my face. Upon arriving at the restaurant, my party and I were greeted by a joyful maitre d'. He gave us a table right beside the window so we could enjoy Yorkville by night :) We ordered from their Winterlicious menu ($35/head) and our waitress was very cheery yet professional and helpful. So far, the dining experience started off with a good vibe.  APPETIZERS: A friend and I got the grilled calamari and another friend got the soup (forgot what it's called, but I attached the pic). The calamari was AMAZING. No fishy seafood smell and it's grilled to perfection. Even the asparagus that came with it tasted so divine. My friend who ordered the soup also enjoyed hers very much.   MAINS: I got the cornish hen and the two friends got the striped bass, which was later substituted by monkfish because they ran out of the bass. My chicken was great. It was crispy on the outside but juicy in the inside. The gravy with roasted pecans and dried cranberries brought enough sweetness to the dish. I loved it. My friends seemed to enjoy their fish dish as well, though they were a bit disappointed that the texture of the fish was rather flakey.   DESSERTS: I got the chocolate crepe and my friends got the creme brûlée. I was surprised to see that the dish was not just a regular crepe with choco sauce, but the crepe itself was a choco crepe with choco sauce!! Choco overload = YUMM-O. The two girls raved about their creme brûlée, so I'll just have take their words for it :)  We each ordered a glass of Pinot to accompany our meals ($12/glass). Our tab came out to be $60/head incl. tips and taxes.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Creme Brasserie and I would definitely go back there to celebrate special occasions (hey, it ain't cheap! :p) Our waitress was very attentive from the beginning til' the end. She even yelled out goodbye and waved excitingly from the back of the restaurant when she saw us leaving (she was cleaning another table). It was a pretty pricey dinner, but it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"I tried Creme Brasserie for Winterlicious dinner this year and I must say I am a fan. The restaurant is hidden off in a courtyard and is not visible along Yorkville St. As soon as I entered the place, the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. The vibe was very laid back and unpretentious. All the staff were very friendly and genuine which made the experience much more pleasant. They made sure that we were welcomed and not rushed throughout the entire dinner. Big props to the friendly service!  As for the food, my friend and I tried different dishes for all three courses. I got the pork belly appetizer, the striped bass main, and the chocolate pot of creme. All three were delicious. I even got to try my friend's dishes and she got the mussels (the sauce was very tasty), the steak, and the raspberry semi freddo.   I would go back to try their regular menu due to the delicious food and excellent friendly service! Great cozy and welcoming place in Yorkville!"}
{"text":"3 of us dined here at my birthday. They made an extra effort to make my day special. They decorated my dessert with some birthday theme. Our waiter was very attentive and polite. Everyone in our party had different meals, all of them were delicious. We will go back again."}
