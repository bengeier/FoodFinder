{"text":"I have never been more disgusted in my entire life. On Tuesday, my girlfriend and I were really craving Indian food so we looked at the menu on India times website, decided what we wanted and then gave them a call. My girlfriend began to place the order for pick up when the man on the phone said he was out of one of the dishes. So she politely turned and asked me what I wanted instead, and I said nothing just order the other dishes we decided on. When she tried to speak to him, he then said \"call me back when you know what you want\" and hung up. Now believe me, I am in the industry and know what it's like to deal with indecisive patrons, which is why I am always fully prepared when I call in an order. I then took her phone and called him back. When he answered the phone he picked up saying \"what?\" so I asked \"why did you just hang up on me? He then began yelling saying \" I told you to call back when you were ready to order\" I then said \" I want to speak to your manger\" he then hung up again. I called back 5 or 6 times, each time he would pick up the phone and hang up. We then drove to India time to speak to him in person. There was not one customer in the place, when I told him who I was he then became so angry and began to scream and yell at me calling me stupid. (the whole time my girlfriend is video taping this) he then kept telling me to get the f**k out. He was so close to my face, screaming, that my girlfriend actually thought he was going to hit me. I was so shocked and mind blown that I actually wanted to call the police. He was a tall bald Indian man with a gold ear ring in his right ear. I hope this review will steer people far away from this place."}
{"text":"Don't know what took us so long to eat here!  Great food perfectly seasoned. Great value. On our favourite list. 
Great job!"}
{"text":"I've never been treated so poorly from a restaurant owner in my life. If I was a man I bet he would have treated me more respectfully. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a corner in the big white building on the north east corner of Yonge and Mulock. Went for the first time for lunch this past Thursday with a work associate. She had Chicken Tikka Masala and loved it. I had Chicken Curry and ADORED it! The naan bread was wonderful, the water was refilled at timely intervals, the service was excellent and welcoming.  

It was so good I raved about it at home at dinner time, enough so that when I suggested lunch there today (Saturday) my son jumped at the chance to join me. 

He had Chicken Tikka Marsala and I had Chicken Curry with spinach....there is a more formal name but I forget it now....what I do remember even as I write this is the impeccable service (my son was even invited into the kitchen to see the tandoor oven - cool!) and the awesome food. The portions were more than generous so we were pleased to take home what we didn't finish. $40 for both of us for lunch including a $6+ tip (very well deserved).

I am sure this is more expensive than I would normally spend for a quick lunch in a workday, but i look forward to dinners there in the future. And take out is a guarantee within the next month!"}
{"text":"As a child whose parents are right off-the-boat English, I can say I have had my fair share of Indian food.  This may seem like a strange statement but there is a correlation between Indian food and the English, aside from the long history, that is, the English have always found a way to mess with Indian food while still trying to keep its authenticity. Unsuccessfully of course.  

For example, most English pubs serve curry. All they do is pop some curry on top of chips (French fries) and \"bloody ell!\" you've got curry fries. Creative right?! I shouldn't complain because it's delicious but after having real Indian food I never want pub-style curry again. 

Even before I tried India Time a couple weeks ago, I was convinced I could eat Indian food everyday for the rest of my life. I hold true to this statement, but with a minor change; I could eat Indian food from India Time everyday for the rest of my life. 

My first experience at India Time was date-night we walked in to order take out, and since I was wearing Lulu Lemon, we figured eating in wasn't the best option. The space had amazing décor, a relaxed atmosphere and a nice romantic feel to it. There were candles on each table, beautiful table settings and nice music. It's perfect for date night. But we stuck with take out. Maybe next time we will eat in when I'm not wearing buffet pants.

For our order we decided on samosas, garlic nan bread and 2 entrées to share, Lamb Korma and Paneer Tikka. I've never had Paneer before, cheese in curry always seem weird to me but I'm not scared to try something new.  

While we were waiting for the food, the owner asked me if I would like to see how the nan bread was made. So I ventured to the back to see the Tandoori and watch him make nan. So cool. When I'm rich I'm gonna have a Tandoori in my kitchen.  

Our food came pretty quickly, considering it was made to order. The samosas came in a chickpea curry, I love chickpeas, so it was a delightful surprise. The nan was perfectly cooked, chewy and soft with a small amount of char.  The lamb was cooked on-the-bone in the curry sauce, which is the best way. The meat was tender and delicious and the korma had a bit of a kick, surprisingly as korma is often more mild. The panner was delicious, similar to cubed ricotta cheese. Previous suspicions aside, I was not disappointed with this dish.  

For the first time I had curry without rice, just with nan, and I got a lesson on how to eat Indian food without a knife and fork. All you need are your hands and nan bread. As messy as it was, I will probably never eat curry with a knife and fork again. 

Honestly, I loved this place.  If I had the money I would never cook for myself again, even if I had a Tandoori in my kitchen. 

On a side note; the prices are pretty decent, more expensive than other Indian restaurants I have tried, but the food was better and you get what you pay for. For the two of us it was about 30 bucks. At that price you could have date night a couple nights a week."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place. My husband is Indian so we can confirm that the food is authentic. We live in Barrie and we drive all the way to Newmarket to get their food. The owner is super friendly and always such a pleasure to interact with him. We will continue going back years to come!"}
{"text":"India Time offers great quality food in great quantities for a reasonable (not cheap) price.  I've been going since the place opened and never had a bad meal.  I'd like to see more in the way of a lunch special.  Ordering an entree and rice and/or naan separately adds up but the food quality is great."}
{"text":"This place just keeps me coming back.

I've visited with my sister-in-law, and a ton of girlfriends & we always have a nice time! The restaurant itself could use a little pick me up esthetically, but overall my taste buds were satisfied. Harry was our server and he made sure to top up our water often. The naan bread was fresh and hot, I think it was homemade?! The palak paneer was delicious (& not too spicy for my virgin Indian taste buds). It was a touch pricier than I was expecting to pay but that won't hold me from coming back. I plan to try more off their menu. 

TIP - cash only.

Since writing this review, I've had plenty of good experiences here. Harry never ceases to amaze us. Always sampling new sauces and different appetizers. He also leaves cooked rice out for the birds which is a sweet touch for the animal lovers... although I'm sure I'll get a bit of negative backlash regarding rice and birds.

Yummo."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food! If you don't like too much heat, make sure to let them know to spice it down a bit. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This was probably some of the most disappointing Indian food I've had. My wife and I both got pulao rice and it was just basmati rice with a bag of frozen mixed vegetables mixed into it. The samosas tasted like they were frozen previously and were very dry. I had the lamb curry and the lamb was very over cooked and the dish contained more bones than lamb. My wife got the Chicken Tika Masala and found it to be very bland and thought the sauce was more like a butter chicken sauce. The naan was ok but also seemed to be bought from the grocery store. 

All in all it wasn't worth the $60 I paid...also they only take cash so be aware of that."}
