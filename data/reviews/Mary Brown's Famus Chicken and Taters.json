{"text":"if you like msg laced chicken this is the place for you !"}
{"text":"Hello friends. Do you like standing and waiting? Do you like being ignored as two workers satisfy a drive thru order? Oh, and do you like being ignored again because a phone order came through? Well this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The manager here is the absolute worst! He has the worst customer service, very rude and unpleasant. I'd rather drive to Whitby or the Oshawa location just to avoid that guy."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as KFC but with less batter on the chicken and instead of fries they have potato wedges here. Got the 3 piece chicken and taters for $7.89"}
{"text":"I love the convenience of the drive thru - and the chicken isn't dry like some other fried chicken chains. This chain doesn't taste so processed. It tastes real! Their seasoning is just better too. And the taters are my favourite."}
{"text":"The food is great. However, I can't give a higher rating due to the poor service: The woman behind the counter (always the same person) is not someone who would be working in the service industry.  She is not friendly and frequently messes up orders ... you only find out items you've ordered and paid for are not included when you get home."}
