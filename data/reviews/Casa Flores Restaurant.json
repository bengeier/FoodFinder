{"text":"We have gone here for years and it is always amazing. Eating here feels like being with family. They are kind and genuinely invested in the community. Besides the lovely people that work here the food is yummy! My kids are picky eaters and Christina always makes sure they get what they like to eat."}
{"text":"We were passing through the area on our way back from Hoover Dam. I ordered a combination plate with a chicken enchilada and a chicken taco. The food was indifferent and the service was poor. The only saving grace were the chips and salsa.  Avoid."}
{"text":"It's this or Totos. Oh yeah and robertos.......ew...... anyhoo, it's decent."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've found in all of Vegas, Henderson and Boulder! Chile verde is delicious! Can't go wrong with the chicken fajitas. And don't forget the bean dip- Yummy! It's a great family owned restaurant. The staff is very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is. Good Mexican food, not great. A welcome change from the overpriced meals in Vegas. We are from the Northeast and were looking for a more authentic Mexican meal. The food was fresh, fairly well seasoned and arrived very fast. I agree with the others that the chips, salsa and bean dip are the best part. The dining room is a bit tired and dingy. I had to work pretty hard to get the waitress (perhaps the owner) to smile, but once she did, she was very friendly. All in all we were happy with the experience, just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"The best place for Mexican food is this. I've never had great Mexican food like Casa Flores, and I don't even eat Mexican! If you're craving Mexican food stop on by to Casa Flores! Best damn Mexican food ever!"}
{"text":"Casa Flores is a nice change from what I've found so far in Vegas for Mexican food. We've now been there twice and both times, the service was friendly and pretty good. Keeping in mind, this is not an upscale restaurant, they did a fine job of waiting on our party of six and got everything out in a timely manner.   The food is good. The first time we dined there, I ordered an enchilada combo and had an excellent albondigas soup to start. This time was the pork chimichanga, which I usually do not get, but I was impressed at how light it was. I've avoided chimichanga's because most places make them heavy and greasy.   Our group was a little disappointed that they do not have beer on tap, so ended up ordering bottles. That's fine at a bar or when your having fast food, but at a sit down dinner at a restaurant, you want a nice, cold glass. Looking at some of the other reviews, it hit me that they do have a bar...so...wouldn't they have beer on tap??? I guess the bar and restaurant must be separate.   Overall, Casa Flores has good food. The decor could use a little updating, but it's clean and casual."}
{"text":"Food was good... our waitress Kelly. Seemed a bit pissy.. And the bathrooms were just plain scary!!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star.. I would. If you enjoy eating shrimp tacos on a Friday night. And the side effects of food poisoning. Such as everything coming out top and bottom all weekend. Along with being laid up in bed with extreme stomach pain. Then this is the place for you. But for the rest of us. Be aware and stay away. I didn't find out about the news posting them in the top dirty dining list until after the fact.   I'd eaten there three times before. One of those times I didn't feel well after. But attributed it to eating late. Well after my weekend of fighting through food poisoning. I now know why I didn't feel well. After eating there the one out of three times earlier. I will never in my lifetime eat there again. And I go out of my way to tell everyone I know. Don't \"EVER\" eat there.   No restaurant should ever make a local news channel dirty dining list. Not even one time is acceptable. Is the owner nice? Yes. But that doesn't make her dirty restaurant filled with health code violations. And getting customers sick acceptable. You've been warned. By the way. I'm a Marine with a stomach that's eaten food from all around the world."}
{"text":"Yummy....first time here and the service was great! So far the margarita was great! Our server was super nice....the food is amazing for being Mexican food in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Came in at 8:15 on a Saturday evening. The hostess, who was leaning over her stand slurping on a drink informed us that they were closed. The sign outsides reads 9 pm as the closing time. She didn't even have the courtesy to fully stand up to greet us.How rude and sloppy of a presentation. The place must make a killing if they can close 45 minutes early on a Saturday. I understand seating the last table at 8:45 but 8:15? Why not close at 8 then. Horrible customer service and at that point I would rather throw my money at a chain fast food place then try to support a small business."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant for the first time. However, we could not even be seated. Upon entering the owners sent out there Daughter, who was probably no more then 8 years old to tell us they are not seating people because they just had a large group walk in. I get it got busy, but it was only about 3:30pm and if your a restaurant you have to learn to deal with having rushes on Saturdays. Not only that but if you can't seat people at this time be professional and have an adult tell us about how long it will take to be seated, we might have been willing to wait. In reality it was only two of us and we could have just sat at the bar. Very bad customer service skills. I expected more from a local small town restaurant."}
{"text":"Never have I seen a business so comfortable with not exceeding or even meeting any level of customer service for that matter.    My first visit to CFR was many years ago and I remember a truly wonderful experience but then again I was already drunk before I entered and not capable of any critical thinking.  I have driven out twice to give it a second chance.  The first time it was closed on a weekday and the second (pre yelp) was less than stellar food and service wise.  Went out today with the boy and GF before heading out to the desert and ended up her for the final say on this place.  First off...confirmed NO HORCHATA!   The salsa and beans with chips were tasty.  That saying literally buried in the menu is a warning...Additional chips, beans and salsa will cost you extra.  For a joint with an atmosphere that I remember fondly growing up in SoCal, one would think the menu would have more to offer.  Service was slow and at one time I tried to elicit (rarely ever try to do) from the lady serving a smile and she would have NONE of it.  I ordered a burrito that was more tortilla than content.  Seeing the sour cream and avocado, I failed to notice on the menu that it was one big pepper similar to a chile relleno, served with beans.  Thank God there was Tapatio and plenty of salt and pepper.  By this time I was so turned off, I decided to not even order a margarita.    I was going to give two stars but as I type I remembered an offensive incident that is going to knock a star off.  As we were waiting for the bill, a couple with child came in.  I heard the gentleman ask for additional cups of salsa telling the same lady that had visited our table, if he could get extra salsa because he loved it and it tasted so good.  I watched as she turned her head and gave a hellacious smirk unbecoming of any of anyone in the service industry.  With that..I decided to stand up and press the delivery of our bill.   We all stood up and walked to the cashier who was watching TV in the bar, but the waiter had not completed the tabulation.    Instead of asking about out dining experience he returned to watch TV with the lady until the waiter appeared with the check.  The verdict is  officially in...if looking for Mexican cuisine in BC at the CFR, seek elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Honestly didn't have the pleasure to eat here. We sat down with a group of 16 (coming from a competing trip), we saw the menu said \"no separate checks\" - so we asked. Server said \"It's not fair to me\" as soon as we brought it up.   Immediately stood up and left."}
{"text":"It was a weekend of boating at Lake Mead, NV.  There are not a lot of options in Boulder City.    My boyfriend's uncle and aunt who have been going to Lake Mead for 12 years took us to dinner at Casa Flores.    I really liked the cheesy decor, complete with fountain and banderitas.  And I liked that their menu was very varied.  However, I did not like their busers.  They would get in your way, and were kind of rude.  Maybe untrained?    Food was excellent though!"}
{"text":"Service was good we were greeted after a few minutes due to only a couple people working. Food here is excellent especially the chips and salsa. I ordered the chicken enchilada plate and the rice and beans were really good. The enchilada sauce wasn't as good as my moms but it was still good. I would come back here if i come through here they are short staffed but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"No horchata!   first of all, what kind of mexican restaurant doesnt know what horchata is??!  the family and i were driving through NV and stopped at this place for food. the food and drinks were actually good and the staff was nice. we werent blown away by the food but we did have a good time and good meal."}
{"text":"We were greeted after 10 minutes of just patiently standing there...by a lady with pink eye!! EW!  She seemed like she could read what was on our minds and immediately said, \"It's just me and one other person working here...\" as she guided us to a table..taking off without saying anything else.  Oh boy.  The waiter was wearing a black net on his head. I could just tell just how short of people they were! The cook IS the waiter as well. The hostess IS a waitress as well. LOL! It's a good thing the waiter was on top of things, because the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either.  Food just reminded me of the same old mexican food joints that I've been to. The salsa for the chips was not chunky, kinda just like soggy marina sauce. The mexican pizza had good ground beef and toppings but they should make it so the thing doesn't fall apart as soon as you pick it up.   The chimichanga was probably the best part, the side of smushed refried beans and fluffy 'fake' orange rice (as I call it), and shreds of useless lettuce was just the same as many other places. Bleh. Bill came to $30. I just don't want to leave with pink eye."}
{"text":"Great place for a spectacular meal, friendly environment and family friendly. I have been going here for years now with family and friends, I am always greeted promptly and seated with a smile; Christina is a great person with a awesome personality and a wonderful work ethic. The food here is superb there is nothing that isn't tasty and delicious, always hot and fresh; prices are very reasonable and you get a lot for what you pay. My favorite is their albondigas soup and chicken tacos with rice. They are always willing to accommodate special requests and changes to meals, if you try Casa Flores you will be hooked for life and it's always good to support local business's that are family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Moved to Vegas from California 11 years ago and could NOT find a decent Mexican restaurant, not like California.  I have to say that I have now found one!    Friendly staff and great food!  I will continue to go back everytime I am in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Update-(reminds me of movie 'Mystic Pizza.') Just left Casa Flores after an excellent meal! Spent the day at Stewart's Point Lake Mead taking Christmas pics! Belly was growling. Once again, Kelly was our Ambassador! Great Team Work amongst team. Had the Margarita, excellent! Nachos & 3item combo platter. Free tortilla chips, bean dip & salsa hit the spot. Homemade salsa had excellent oregano flavor. Albondingas soup was very good although pasta is now elbow. Same med. well tasty albondigas! Nachos were very good. My chicken taco was good although that too has changed to premade Taco Bell style shell, wife did not like it. Son DJ had childs Quesadilla & beans, loved every bit. Definitely the best Mexican food this side of Arizona/California border. Again, stay away from Poncho's in Summerlin- YUCK!! Please bring back homemade taco shells. Chef Gordon Ramsey said it is the easiest most important thing to make in a mexican food restaurant otherwise we could all make tacos at home! Please mention Yelp reviews to keep'em honest. Carlos"}
{"text":"I wasn't here today but I forgot to check in the last time.  I went with my, then girlfriend. We had gone to the Hoover dam and stopped here on the way back.   Decent Mexican food. I wanted mole but they didn't have it that day.   Good restaurant style, family Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We love coming here. The food is great and they know exactly how we like our food cooked. We have been coming here for two years and even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here. Great place for a good Margarita."}
{"text":"Been there several times and never disappointed.  Took a girlfriend there for a lunch one day. We were just visiting BC. She loved the lunch so much, that she asked for a take out order for breakfast the next day.  That says volumes for this restaurant and the quality of food.  The wait staff is very professional. They will come back to the table to ensure the customer is pleased with the meal.  And it is a nicely appointed dining room.  Would recommend this Mexican restaurant to any food lover."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the lake when we decided to stop for a quick mexican appetizers, found out this cute place which seduced us with nice art and decorations right from the entrance. Very pleasant stuff, service and ambience. We recieved our food quickly even though was a busy sunday afternoon.   The food was so fresh and flavorful and we were surprized by the big portions they serve here.  We will definetley coming back ."}
{"text":"Not worth even 1 star.. Worse experience ever. Food was cold and blend and the worse customer service ever..not sure how that ace still open. Shame."}
{"text":"How are you going to close your restaurant an hour early!?!? Drove from Las Vegas because we like the food but now we won't be back cause I'm not going to take the chance of them being closed. Also, OPEN sign & all lights were on outside, when we tried to open the locked front door, they shut off the lights. You can't come open door & say oh sorry we closed early blah blah blah....."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant (and extraordinarily cool bar)! We had a great lunch and wonderful visit. This is the real deal!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The food is wonderful and authenticate. The atmosphere is nice and comfortable and a great place to bring the wife for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible - Do not go to this pig pen. The service is rock bottom, the owners son is driving it into the ground. The waitress could not be any more rude if she tried. Dirty, dingy, gross."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and authentic.  A family owned and operated business I have been a customer of Casa Flores for the past six years and have always found the staff to be friendly and accommodating.  A definite asset to Boulder City! - Jen K."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly great at Casa Flores. Why surprisingly? Mexican restaurants are generally \"good enough\" places - the expectations are met easily on Mexican food. But at Casa Flores the meal we had was significantly above typical Mexican expectations. Food was fresh and expertly seasoned. The guacamole and salsa were homemade and just tasted sublime. Tortillas were also fresh. Definitely a great spot for Mexican food in old Boulder City."}
{"text":"Pretty good, funny mostly just men eating here"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food here.This place was recommended by a friend and I'm so happy she told me about it.Ive lived here in Nevada for 8 years and haven't had Mexican food this good since my last trip to California.We will return again in the future."}
{"text":"Boulder City desperately needs a quality Mexican restaurant. Sadly, this is not it.  I can only imagine that this place stays open because of loyal bar patrons that swill cheap drinks in their separate lounge area.  We should have turned right around as soon as we entered and the wave of industrial bleach smell washed over us.  The place smelled like a highway rest stop.  But we had just finished a long walk and were famished, so we took a shot.  Besides the smell, the atmosphere was primarily what you might call \"sad.\"  Everything looked a bit dingy, and the dim Mexican-villa-styled dining room made you yearn for sunlight.  Service was... okay.  Though, due to the language barrier, a request for a straw had to be repeated three times.  Salsa and chips were refreshed without issue, though the salsa tasted like it was made by someone whose ability to taste garlic had been surgically removed.  I adore garlic but not when it's the only thing I can taste in my salsa.  When our food arrived, my first thought was, \"THIS was $15?\"  The chicken fajitas I had ordered did not come out sizzling like one might expect, but rather swimming in a pool of... I think... vegetable oil?  The strips of chicken were gray, and the vegetables were all crunchless and drunk on (even more) garlic powder.  On the plus side, I guess, the tortillas were warm.  Someone, anyone else, please open a decent Mexican restaurant in Boulder City so that I can wash the memory of this one out of my mind with a tasty margarita."}
{"text":"I hate to write negative reviews, but the food was terrible and instant bag guacamole. Potato\" tamales. This is not true Mexican food, it like someone used a cook book and tried there best. Unfortunately no true Mexican food in Boulder City, Nevada."}
{"text":"I moved to CA for a couple of years and recently returned to live in BC. When it came time to have some good Mexican food we returned to Casa Flores which was formerly the only Mexican food I'd eat in BC since Carlos' closed. I must say it was absolutely disappointing. I'm accustomed to the cheerful and friendly face of Christina greeting us but it was the night she's off so I couldn't ask her what was up with the food? First thing I noticed when our food arrived was that the taco shells were cold, limp, perfectly shaped thin shells like you can buy at the grocery store.  In the past the shells were obviously hand fried fresh and crispy goodness. My chicken tacos were so bad that I couldn't even eat half my food. In the past these tacos were delicious so I wish I knew what's up here with the cook? My husband had Chili Verde and he said it was okay but not as good as in the past. Something's up here for sure, not many diners this night like back a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Christina makes the best margaritas around! Definitely worth the trip to Boulder City."}
{"text":"The guacamole tasted like it was squirted out of a bottle, the albóndigas tasted like canned soup that they just put meatballs in to call albóndigas the chicken tasted rotisserie and the salsa they serve with chips and beans tasted like pizza sauce, the carne asada was I would say carne Asad-eh. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a hard 2, the service was great our waitress was very attentive and patient.  The only thing Mexican about this place was the sombreros on the ceilings and the Mexican music playing.  10/10 would never come again. One and done."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years....always greeted warmly and have been waited on by both Kelly and Christina, but now just Christina usually takes care of us. If it's just hubby and I, Christina always asks about our kids and grandkids and we always appreciate that. The food is always consistent, my husband always gets the same thing and it's always comes out prepared the same way and my husband appreciates that as he does not like change. I vary between different dishes and have enjoyed all of them. Chips, salsa, and bean dip are always good and prompt. Christina makes damn good margaritas and they are strong....I am not a lightweight and I had one and I was feeling it. Interior of place is not fancy, which doesn't bother me because I like more low key establishments. I have a friend who is new in the Henderson area and asked for recommendations for a \"comfortable authentic Mexican restaurant\" for a date and I recommend Casa Flores and she said her and her date loved the place and she has been raving about it and has gone back since. I read previous Yelper reviews about a son, or male manager, that worked there and was a complete tool and for all the years I have been going there I have not seen this person there, so hopefully he got fired ( from the sounds of his behavior it was deserving) so don't let that dissuade you from trying out this place!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican joint in boulder city. Kelli is absolutely amazing behind the bar and is always fun to see and chat with, she is awesome all around really haha. The owner Christina is super nice and always has delicious menu items her and her husband the chef cook up. The decor is authentic looking inside, a separate bar area and has a nice dining area for family. My all time fave thing to order that is not on the menu but you can ask for it is, their fish taco, ohhh my it's the best fish taco I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The only reason it got one star is because I couldn't  give it zero stars, food was like eating salt out of the salt dispenser. Servers were ok. When I complained about the food there was no effort made by management to even talk to me. My family ate at Casa Flores many years ago and really enjoyed the food. Don't know what's happened to this place but I'll never be back. It's pretty sad when you can get better chips and salsa at 7-Eleven."}
{"text":"Exactly what you've come to expect from generic Mexican restaurants. You sit down, they pump you full of chips and salsa, disappointing margaritas, and tasty but inauthentic Mexican food. I got the smothered bean and cheese burrito. Not bad."}
{"text":"The best carnitas taco I have eaten in my 56 years (#167 on the menu). Planning to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Wonderful cadillac margaritas, bean dip, and shredded beef taquitos! Ask for the super spicy salsa."}
{"text":"I have been to Casa Flores in years past and my only complaint had been the slow service.  My family and I decided to try it out this past weekend for the first time in about 2 years.  Lobby and actual dining area appeared clean, but looked old and dusty. The food was obviously microwaved and boring. The restrooms were absolutely disgusting (gas station restrooms are cleaner) and if that was any clue as to how clean the kitchen is kept....ugh!!  Lets put it this way...if I had seen the restrooms first we would have immediately left. Save your money, time and yourself from possible food poisoning and travel into Henderson to a great little place called El Torito."}
{"text":"Love Casa! They have the best hot salsa! the crunchy tacos are delish and the rice and beans are always perfect! I got a carne as ada burrito this time enchilada style.. so yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and kind of gross! I was especially disappointed by the \"fresh real avocado\" guacamole. It had no texture whatsoever and looked like green toothpaste, when I braved a bite I found it was totally flavorless. We ordered huevos rancheros and the egg was so runny it was slimy, ranchero sauce was flavorless, just overall gross. The restroom was poorly managed (lights out, paper towel dispenser broken, mismatched paint) and kind of dirty. The very small upside was that the staff were extremely friendly and caring, they refilled drinks often and checked on us often. I don't know how regular that type of service is though since we (aside from one couple with their baby) were the only people there (there were 11 of us). I found out after we ate it had been on dirty dining, no surprise there!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. The dining room is dirty, the other patrons are loud and the food is not consistent. I will add one caveat to this review to say that I do not really care for Mexican food so it has to be good when I go and this is really nothing special. I have had the chile relleno here a few times because it is something I generally like but it is too eggy here for me. I will just not come back here even though I have given it several chances."}
{"text":"No, just no. I've had better \"Mexican\" at Taco Bell.   Everything from the broken booth to the dingy interior were huge turnoffs.  Two stars because the waitress was pleasant.   I couldn't get out of here fast enough."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food. I had a ground beef enchilada and a shredded beef enchilada. Both were stuffed with meat. I also liked the enchilada sauce. Very flavorful. Also had a shredded beef tamale in the side. It was just okay. It was a different shredded beef then the enchilada as it had green chili's and a few small pieces of potato in it but was mostly the corn meal casing, not much meat filling.   Service was good. Appeared to only be one waitress and a bus boy who also brought the chips and drinks. There was at least 12 tables and I thought the waitress and bus boy did a great job of keeping up with everyone.   I love Mexican food and this is on the top of my list for places in the Vegas area. Not in Boulder City much but would definitely eat here again.   Last time I ate at the Mexican restaurant in the old Vons plaza. I thought it was overpriced and honestly the food wasn't that good. I'd much rather eat here. Much more reasonable prices and better food."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The manager aka owners son is rude and very disrespectful.  Went there with a large group and he refused to seat us.  Told us it would be better if we left .  The waitress was trying to seat us when manager made a rude comment to my wife.  Instead of beating his ass we left.  Drive the extra 5 miles to the Fiesta great Mexican restaurant just inside:"}
{"text":"I only gave this one star because I cant leave it blank. I was there June 23. If you look at the heat for the day this area got like 117 degrees. This place must turn off air conditioner in order to save money when not open. Seems reasonable RIGHT? EPIC FAIL when you wait until you open the doors of a large restaurant to turn it on. It was too hot to enjoy the food. It was also unbearable to the two waitresses trying to serve the few customers that  WERE there. The one was RUDE as hell also probably she was too hot. So turn your dam air on in this Vegas area weather or your likely going to be able to keep your air off permanently  due to customer in their right mind dealing with that. When we were there you lost several customers"}
{"text":"Called and asking for a reservation for 18 but were we told they didnt take reservations.  however they did tell us  they already had a party 15 coming, isn't that a reservation!  We decided to go anyway and were greeted by a pleasant waitress.  She started to try to seat us together till the owners son came in and was rude to her and us and said he would not sit us together. So we sat down in separate booths and tables. He got rude and nasty with us because we filled all but 2 of his tables. isn't that the idea of a business?  Because of his temper tantrum, attitude and rudeness we decided we were not going to eat there and continue to be treated poorly.  Apparently your not welcome if there are more than 3 in your party. I hope the owner get a chance to read this because we won't come back or recommend this place to anyone else!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horribly disgusting place to eat. I hit one star on accident and don't know how to delete it. There are not enough words in the English dictionary to describe how bad this place is. The best part about this place is I didn't get sick. Stay away. You're better off eating out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell. And healthier for it."}
{"text":"Our entire family loves this place and have been going there for almost 5 years now - it's your typical selection of mexican food and it's really good!  The staff is always fun & friendly and the margaritas are AWESOME! Yes it's older & the bathrooms could use a make-over, but good food, great drinks, & fun people make it worthwhile stop!"}
{"text":"Family owned,  we have been coming here for years. Great service but on busy nights be willing to eat some chips and salsa while you wait. We always order the same items. Always leave feeling full. Happy to support our friends.  They are so nice to us."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst excuse for Mexican food I have ever had. Service was terrible. We were left at our table with no drinks or anything for over 20 minutes, while 2 tables that were seated after us were taken care of. We tried to be patient and understanding, but when we finally received our food it was cold and tasteless. I wish it was possible to give negative stars."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever! The waitress is rude and argues with customers, the drinks are yuck,and the food is uneatable. Taco bell is a step up from Casa Flores. The health inspector should pay them a visit. There are bugs in the bathroom so you know they are in the kitchen too. The cook came out from the back and YIKES, he looks like he picks his noes and never washes his hands. The decor is horrible unless your into cockroaches. My boyfriend made himself vomit after because he was so sickened,my friend said she wouldn't even feed any of the left overs to her dog, This place Sucks, Sucks, and Sucks even more. MY advise is BEWARE AND AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU WANT TO WIND UP IN HOSPITAL"}
{"text":"The food here is great, but I will not come back due to the service. I've been here twice and both times the service has been frustratingly poor and slow."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in town. They have the best bean dip I've ever had. The owner is so kind, and I highly recommend a margarita on the rocks and chicken tacos."}
{"text":"This place is awful I tried several time s hair in the cold soup then went back to the bar side 2 years later they said sorry we are slow so you need to leave .  Went to Totos the other Mexican restaurant had great service drinks laughter  this place is is joke . Try Totos way better"}
