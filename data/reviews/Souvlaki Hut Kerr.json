{"text":"A friend of mine and I went in for lunch and we were really impressed. We got exactly want we wanted and more. I didn't realize that the portions are so huge. The staff are super friendly and helped me decide what to order. I would go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Over a year ago i would have given this place a 5 star rating. First time my bf and I went there we were hooked.. we always got the dinner platters.. so much food. The meat was guaranteed to always be juicy.. the salad was an amazing portion and everything was just good. It was a little pricey for our budget but if we wanted to splurge... we went there first. Fast forward to now... the food has gone downhill. The meat is anywhere from dry to meh.. (i only eat the chicken) and the salad... everytime i see it.. it almost makes me angry. It really does look like they tossed a couple pieces of lettuce in and called it a day. Also, i could be wrong.. I believe they make it to order.. even the dressing... the last time i was there (2 weeks ago) the oregano... my god... thats all i could taste.  I do suggest you watch as the pack your food too.. sometimes but not all the time they forget items.. the honey sticks mainly... which might i add... use to have a nice glaze to them.. last time they just tasted like bread with some seasoning.  Will we go back... probably.. why? We keep hoping that this location will go back to the way it was. We'll eventually give it up......"}
{"text":"Basic but good. The place used to be better but it's declined in the last year. I have had items ordered but not packed more then once. Still the value and quality are okay for take out.   If I was reading in I would go to Colossus as its only 5 minutes away and is worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! At affordable prices and friendly staff. I love that you get very large portions of food for competitive prices and the food is quick and ready to order. They're not bogged down with a million food items that are subpar but focus in on a few that are amazing!   All of my friends say they love Souvlaki hut better than the other Greek restaurant chains - it's the same price and this food is cooked fresh in front of you.  That's hard to find in the fast food era. No microwaved chicken here!   I love this place. I'm always there."}
