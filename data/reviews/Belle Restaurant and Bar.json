{"text":"The place is very nice and the food is very delicious. All waitresses are very friendly. The prices are very reasonable. They even have live music. I visited this place with my friends few times and every time I have desire to come here again. I would recommend to visit Belle Restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great, but they have the worst customer service of any restaurant I have ever been to. My advice, take the food to go."}
{"text":"The breakfast that is advertised is terrible. The eggs have one of the oddest flavours I have ever tasted, and eggs are hard to mess up. The turkey bacon had little to no flavour. The sausage was a hot dog cut in half and cooked like a spider wiener from a camping trip, and it was an extra two dollars for it. The hash browns were decent but a very small portion. The price was good but not worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable price, very friendly staff and caring owners. My favorite is chicken Shawarma dinner at Belle."}
{"text":"We always order the meat platter so we can eat alittle bit of everything the salad is really good the fries the rice and the potato chips are amazing!! Would recommend"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about three years, I met some Israeli people that became close friends with for the short time they were staying in Canada, and they brought me to this restaurant. It is AMAZING ! I continue to come here, and make such hype about it to all my friends, that all my friends have now been here. This is also my first choice for dining out with my family.  My usual, start with the hummus, my main is the white chicken breast kabob, with home potatoes.  Has a starter salad, the dressing is SO good!   Today, since I had my wisdom teeth taken out, i ordered the barszcz (not sure how it is spelt there I'm Polish and this is the way we spell it)  and got a side of fried eggplant (since it was easy to swallow)  Very happy!  the owner is an amazing warm welcoming man as well!  Will be back in a few weeks to enjoy the chicken since I wasn't able to chew tonight!   10/10 !!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a high star rating.  We shared the platter for 4 - which was really sized for 6.  It was terrific. The grilled vegs- eggplant and tomatoes were terrific. The you choose your meats - we had beef kabobs- lamb and chicken - all excellent - fries and rice.  3 Mediterranean dips were great.  All in great value and just the speed we were looking for."}
{"text":"I love their food my favourite is their lamb  It's tender, cooked to perfection, and so good you can't stop eating it. I am impressed with everything they have, the rice, thin slices of potatoes, the chicken,  but most of all the lamb. I would recommend them to anyone, as they know how to preparebfood consistently, and deliver it. Does it get any better, I will let you know when I visit the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing dining experience. Mostly because it is so subtle. However you go inside, get seated and feel a warmth. They will give you an assortment of starters( pickled vegetables) and freshly warmed pita's and a house salad (their house salad dressing is wonderful) on arrival. Enough food to get you somewhat full and you haven't even placed an order. I usually end up getting the chicken kebab, and they are kind enough to split the sides in two; I get the home fries which are cut very thin and cooked to a perfect crisp along with rice or maybe fries depending on my mood. The flavour on the chicken is amazing, moist and grilled to a perfection. When I feel like treating myself; I order the Lamb Chops. Cant help feeling like a king once i'm done that meal. Plus they have nice ice cold Stella on tap!!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner  Specialty: Israeli Menu items: Hummus Appetizer, Chicken Kebab and Lamb Chops  On the epicenter of Middle-Eastern cuisine in North York, in the north-east corner of Bathurst and Finch, you will find a tiny but mighty \"shawarma\" style looking spot called Belle Bar & Restaurant. This place is home to one of the best executions of modern-Israeli cuisine I have ever had the pleasure to come across.  From the outside, you will not even think there is a restaurant there. My first thought?...cool we are doing take-out shawarma. However, once you venture into the place, you will notice the welcoming staff and family feel to it, as well as spot about 6-8 tables hidden in the back. It sort of reminds me of El Trompo on Kensington Market.  The menu is quite extensive and offers all kinds of meats like Chicken, Beef, Lamb and even seafood platters. As a hummus lover, I order this to kick-start our meal.  The hummus is soft and not too garlicky; which is great, because it soothes after-taste, or lessens it at the very least. Its centre is filled with olive oil and spices. Again, these are not overpowering, just the right amount.  Next I order the Dark meat Chicken Kebab. The meat is tender and moist (apologies to those who hate this word) and it's seasoned with red onions, coriander (aka Cilantro), parsley (aka Italian cilantro, just kidding) and from what I recall, paprika, pepper and cumin...I am sure there were more. All in all, a great tasting meat.  As accompaniments, you have the option to choose between fries, rice or salad or a mix. I ordered half and half of the fries and rice. The fries are in a potato chip presentation, but still are well done fries; not too salty, not too soft or crunchy, just done right.  The rice is nothing special but it tastes great and is well prepared so I have no complains here.   Last in the order are the Lamb Chops. I have been asked before if I eat all of the dishes when I review restaurants, and my answer is always that I am blessed to have friends and family that are more than willing and happy to join me in my search for the best meals. So yes I did try the Lamb Chops, but this was not my dish.    The Lamb Chops did not disappoint either. With similar but slightly different seasoning as the Chicken Kebab, this lamb had the same attributes I spoke off before...taste, moisture, seasoning and preparation; a very good 9/10 for me.  Note to reader: Belle does not have a menu online yet or a website.  Until next time Foodies!  Buen Provecho,  Viviana."}
{"text":"Quality food and excellent service. It's hardly ever busy but the portions are huge and tastes phenomenal. Recommend the dark meat chicken dinner and baba ganoush. Every part of these two items are amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of this restaurant for lunch and dinner!!  My grandpa who was visiting from HK said he wanted to have lamp chops.. This neighbourhood grill came to kid first!  This place has been around for probably 10 years and the chefs have changed from time to time, but still the same owner..  My favourite items here are the lula Kebob and lamb chops!! They never disappoint!!  The lamb shish-Kebob is also really good.  If you're coming here which 4 people or more, the party platter definitely the way to go!!  I must say this place also has the best home fries ever!!! My mom doesn't eat fries or home fries usually and she devoured it!!  Service is always friendly and portions are huge.. A couple could definitely share dinner combo!"}
{"text":"You're classic russian jewish joint - food is quite good. Much better than Sofra for example.   Worth mentioning - the BBQ'd seabass here is excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here for weekend breakfasts after hitting the gym.  It's served all-day so we don't need to rush.  The $4.99 special is hard to beat.  It comes with 3 eggs, toast and potatoes but we ask for sliced tomatoes and cukes instead...trying to cut down on the fried foods...yeah, yeah, I know my eggs weren't poached.  It includes coffee or tea as well.  Quite the deal!  They also have shakshooka (Israeli omelette with stewed vegetables) which is good. My daughter will eat the Israeli meats - chicken or lamb on a skewer at any time of day. My son was disappointed with the Greek salad however."}
