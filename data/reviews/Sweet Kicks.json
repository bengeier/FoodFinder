{"text":"Cool place was visiting from California. Sneakers and BOBA why not. Will stop in again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so cool inside! They sell sneakers and Supreme gear and more! If you're a hype beast and parched come here! Need some new jays or some Yeezys come thruuuuuu! They're opening is 4/28/18 they're having a party. It's going to be lit. The employees are very helpful. It's like going to the mall they got errrrthang! Lol but I'm very happy with my drink and I got a supreme sticker and will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Take all of my money!! I got a strawberry açaí drink which was to die for. Seriously so good! The place has a really fun vibe with a DJ booth, it seems like a fun place to hang out. If you're into shoes and hype stuff they have a really good collection available too. I will be back for more drinks!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Aria in San Francisco, but instead of Korean tapas, it's boba and Asian desserts. While having the fusion of street wear and boba, this is already an Asians place to hangout. They have a pretty good drink selection, my personal favorite is the citrus mint. They have shoes ranging from GR to a few grails. While keeping the street wear theme, Supreme decks are on the walls, Bape accessories are sold. And also a shirt selection ranging the majority of ASSC and a small selection of Supreme tees. Overall it's a cool place to hangout. I'm really just there cause of the citrus mint."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this totally badass tea shop the other night with a couple friends. The gentleman making my drink was incredibly friendly and welcoming. He spoke about their vision, their sweet little dogs and their decor. I got a Vietnamese Iced Coffee and it was the real deal. It was sweeter than most coffees I take but it was delicious. Since they just recently opened, I hope to see their business thrive. They're dog friendly! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Taste the sweet, sour, and hot in one flavorful cup  Taste? I ordered the Fiery Phoenix aka Vero Mango Chili covered slushy version. The taste of the chili covered all the slushy. I expected to receive real mango drink. Turned out, it was just a light mango flavor. I could barely taste that mango, more on the side of saltiness, chili, and ice  Menu? The basic menu is easy to look and choose. It's not too fancy but I would like to pick out my sugar and ice level (for the tea).   Price? My drink cost $5.19 for a 20 oz. Since it is a special drink, I'd say the price is meh. Not cheap but not hella expensive. Plus, there is a reward system from Squareup although I never drank in one place enough to get a free drink. The max I had for all these years was 7 stamps.  Atmosphere? I came at 5pm and no one was there beside me and the employee. The interior design is unique, full of Supreme branded item which I'm not interested. I only collect Louis Vuitton items. I'm old school. I don't even own any Gucci, just a bunch of Louis Vuitton but that's about it. The items they sell, as expected, were fake. Or else they'd reside in anti theft glass shelf. The fancy and somewhat hipster display crack me up. I love the creativity! The sad thing is the shop faces the West aka the hot sun in the afternoon will attack"}
{"text":"Talk about great vibes! I could come by here everyday just to make my day that much better! I'm so glad the owners of this place brought us AZ residences a place like this!"}
{"text":"They've got Sweet Kicks and kickin' sweets at this little corner shop right next to the hot pot restaurant. It's like a boba tea shop and an LA streetwear store had a love child and stashed it away in AZ to hide it from the paparazzi. I dig the vibe. I don't know much about sneakers but the selection they had on the wall looked intriguing, and I'm assuming very expensive since a lot of the shoes were shrink wrapped to preserve their new condition. They offer brands like Supreme, Anti Social Social Club clothing wise, as well as cell phone covers, keychains, bumper stickers, and they even had a cute Comme des Garcons/Supreme doggie shirt for sale. I love how the shop is dog friendly, with a Supreme water bowl near the front for your four-legged hype beast to quench his/her thirst with.  Prices for the shirts, sweaters, and hoodies ranged from $75-400 on the rack. While the shirts cost a premium due to the brand names, the bubble tea is actually quite reasonable. They had a nice selection of fruity, caffeinated, and more traditional milk teas. You can customize your sweetness level and ice level like at other shops. I tried the oolong milk tea with grass jelly and strawberry acai with yogurt popping boba, 25% sweetness. I also had a sip of the blended taro drink at full sweetness.   The oolong milk tea had a lighter sweetness than other shops that offer 25% sweetness. I liked the oolong flavor in the drink. The grass jelly floated on top though which made it hard to suck up through the straw. The strawberry acai is a caffeinated drink and the 25% sugar level was just right for me and there was a plentiful amount of popping boba in it. It tasted lightly carbonated with a few strawberry pieces on top and was very refreshing. The taro drink tasted like your average taro drink made from powder.   Another nice aspect of this shop is that you can request almond or soy milk for your drink.  In addition to drinks they have a case of tempting macarons and little cakes for sale.  The shop is open late which is also a plus. I'll be back to try more off the menu!"}
{"text":"The Fiery Phoenix is amazing! I highly recommend it . Especially if you are a person who loves mango"}
{"text":"They call me ranch 'cause I be dressing.  When I saw this jewel pop up, I knew I had to try it out.  Knowing so many sneakerheads, it was my duty to march in here and pretend like I know what I'm looking at.  And better yet, why not look at all the hypebeast/hypebae stuff with a delicious drink?  We got the Forbidden Fruit Blended with boba and a Fiery Phoenix.  I wasn't feeling the Forbidden Fruit drink but that Fiery Beast was like a mangonada and I'm here for it.  I would come back for that drink alone.  As for the two sweets I got, an Earl Grey macaron and a pink mini petit four, I would pass on it.  So yeah, take a look at all the Supreme and Anti Social Social Club merch, admire all the $1-$2k shoes preserved in shrinkwrap, take a picture in front of the selfie wall, and buy some cool stuff.  The A/C is freezing and the drinks are proper.  3.5 stars!"}
