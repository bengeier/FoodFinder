{"text":"I'll start with dessert!! Loved the Ricotta Zeppole with butter caramel sauce and cinnamon gelato!! Great atmosphere and pleasant staff and service!! If price is a concern this is not the place to go!! Great Scallops and Salmon Crudo."}
{"text":"This whole experience was amazing. I have never written a review but this place deserves it. The chef cooked everything perfectly. The steak was honestly the best I've had in my whole life! We were truly in love with every dish we ordered. Our server, Mary, was so great. She was very attentive, sweet, and was knowledgeable about the menu. Her and the chef made us feel so well taken care of (even a little spoiled). 

We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Went to restaurant week dinner there tonight.  The food was good, about what you would expect during restaurant week.  The problem was the heat and the service.  After 45 minutes, I asked if the air could be turned down and was told there was a problem with the air conditioner.  No comment from staff, until I asked.  By the time we left, at best, it was the same temperature as outside, mid to upper 80s.  A/C problems happen, but we should have been told when we arrived and given the option to reschedule.  The heat was compounded by how long we had to be in it.  They had 11 total items on their menu.  3 were desserts of the type that would definitely be made ahead of time.  Why did it take 2 and a half hours to serve us when they only had 8 different items to prepare for the whole restaurant?  It was 30 minutes before we got drinks, at least another 15 before the first course, at least 20 minutes AFTER finishing each course before the next was served and 20 minutes after finishing dessert before we got the bill.  There was never any apology about the heat or slow service."}
{"text":"I dined here twice while staying at Le Meridien and both meals were delicious. 

Our waitress was extremely friendly and did a phenomenal job of recommending meal choices. 

I dined on both the filet mignon and the halibut. The filet came with a variety of salts that added the perfect burst of flavor to the dish. The halibut was fresh and the toppings were a great complement.  For sides, I had tastings of the pommel frites, brussels sprouts, broccolini (all amazing) and the toasted farro which was okay. 

For dessert I went for the creme brûlée and even though I was stuffed, I still found some room!

A truly delicious meal and our waitress pushed our dining experience up a notch."}
{"text":"Giving this place five stars because I have been nearly ruined when it comes to eating anywhere else in Charlotte. Dramatic, yes, and totally true. The restaurant serves consistently delicious food and, save for my occasional vegan fancies, this traveling girl is in love. Favorites: Peruvian ceviche; Jerusalem artichoke bisque with seared scallop; scallop main course with squash risotto; bucatini pasta; Butcher burger (if seated at the bar). Fancy cocktails, a lengthy wine list and (what?) a bartender who is also a magician. Staff is multinational, attentive and knows their ingredients. Prices reflect the fancy fare, but if it's in your budget and you're looking for a special night out, I recommend this spot. I love good food and beautiful presentation and this place has me totally spoiled."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in town. Modern decor great drinks and awesome food! Ordered their Parisian mule for drinks and it was a really good twist. The lobster and the marlin to start were out of this world. Freshness of seafood was on point. Next up was the porterhouse for 2. 40oz of solid beef, yeah enough to feed 2-3 people. The wife and i split it and gave plenty to the other couple. They serve 4 different rock salts with the steaks which is a nice touch. The gnocchi was the best I've ever had, period. Come for the drinks and be amazed by the food."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing, services was outstanding. Food was really good, the salmon was remarkable but if you are hungry the portions are so petite: \"gourmet\"

Great environment and ambiance! Definitely we are coming back!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing prix-fixe Valentine's Day dinner here last night. Delicious from the first course to the last, accompanied by great wine."}
{"text":"I truly don't understand how this restaurant has even half decent reviews. We had reservations on a Saturday night, but the ENTIRE time we were there, only saw 2 other tables in the entire restaurant (3 people). You'd think we'd have amazing service, right? wrong. The staff couldn't figure out what dish belonged to who, or keep our waters full. While some of the food was awesome (ceviche!), the steaks were terrible all around- tough and poor quality. We ordered a $90 steak, and gave up after it came out wrong twice (first cooked med, then completely raw except for the slightest sear). After receiving our over $100 bill for a meal we didn't have (weren't charged for the steak, but we were for the other food we had ordered- deserts were offered on the house), we noticed water pouring from the ceiling. Not dripping, pouring. We alerted the bartender, who asked us if we were \"pissing\" on the floor\". Not funny. He then mentioned the pool was directly above us and had opened earlier that day. This was pretty alarming, so we immediately jumped up and paid our bill from a safer location within the restaurant.

Even If the pool hasn't collapsed into the restaurant by morning, avoid this place."}
{"text":"WHAT A PLACE! 

You enter the establishment and the decor is modern, clean, and well done. The hostess was flexible and allowed us to gather at the bar for some tasty cocktails, the ladies had a mixture of custom libations put together by a seasoned Bartender who also would entertain you with magic (Xavier). (House Cab is \"Justin\"? Not familiar but was delicious, also have Matchbook by the glass which is wonderful as well)

When we finally sat, the table had a sense of intimacy as you were almost enclosed in our section. As it added a sense of privacy, it allowed our six top to let loose and enjoy the evening. 

(The Food): First off the meat smells and looks amazing.. At first you think it is extremely expensive, but to put things in perspective you could literally split the 36 Oz Rib Eye between three people, which Evoke actually suggests! 

Anyway, we began with the Crudo, Himachi & Escolar (similar to white Tuna - Butter) 
Well Portioned and Well presented and delicious!

Next we enjoyed the pasta's! They were out of the Gnocchi but had a fresh batch being made, so we waited. Well worth the wait! Airy, Light, Pillows! Large Lump Crab and Pancetta made my and my buddies evening... Ravioli, unreal, Bucantini the hostess said she dreams about and she is right, it is amazing! 

Review is way too long, so I think everyone gets the point.. This is a Gem! 

One flaw, they need to have some sort of background music.. They need music! 

I will return and look forward to trying the entire menu.. Very Impressed!"}
{"text":"Restaurant feels like an extension of the lobby and is lit like a hospital operating room. Some of the diners were dressed in sweats. Waiter talked our ear off. Wanted a dry-aged ribeye and decided on this spot after seeing a couple of good reviews. Very disappointed. $350 down the drain..."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night and we were looking forward to their amazing drink and menu selection. However; the bartender was a little rude and the food was subpar. My main focus is the food, which sounded and looked delicious. Ultimately, the food we ordered was over-seasoned with salt or too tough to eat."}
{"text":"The portions are very small.  The prices are very high.  The pasta was undercooked.  The 2 stars are for the decor and service; both were good. They had a large wine selection but their sweetest wine was sour. Disappointed at best."}
{"text":"We checked out EVOKE recently at the Le Meridien hotel and absolutely loved every bite of our exotic salt covered NY Strip Steak. Le Meridien recently sank $20+ million into the former Blake Hotel and although it doesn't look much different on the outside (yet) the interior decor is straight out of a Mad Men episode. Equipped with 1960's era Donald Draper modern glam, floor-to-ceiling windows, posh seating areas, and pops of yellow accents are featured throughout the predominantly earth tone inspired interior.

EVOKE is chasing an Italian-Mediterranean \"New-Age Steakhouse\" approach by offering dry-aged prime cuts of steak, exotic salts, house-made pastas, and... crudos? I'll get to that later.

We started off the night by getting the Sweet Gem Lettuce Salad and the Baby Romaine Salad. The Sweet Gem Lettuce salad was equipped with tender greens, avocado, tomato, blue cheese, quail egg, bacon, and was covered with a champagne vinaigrette. The salad was a great (light) way to start off the night and the champagne vinaigrette paired perfectly with the quail egg.

The Baby Romaine Salad came with radicchio, vincotto, croutons, and shaved parmigiano reggiano. Again... a great salad with a light touch to start off the night but the croutons we're WAY too big and near impossible to eat.

Next up was the Hamachi crudo with avocado, crispy shitake mushroom, and black hawaiian sea salt. For those that don't know what a crudo is... think carpaccio, sushi, steak tartate, etc... I didn't think I was going to like the Hamachi, I was definitely wrong. The Hamachi crudo with its shitake mushrooms that somehow taste like bacon we're one of the highlights of the night :)

After the Hamachi came the sweet potato and ricotta ravioli with bourbon butter. This dish could easily be eaten as a dessert thanks to its incredibly sweet flavor profile.

For the entree's we sampled the 16oz 21 day Dry-Aged NY Strip Steak with a side of Truffle Pomme Frites, Truffle Potato Puree, and Grilled Asparagus. At this point in the night my partner had already eaten above her weight class and I was just getting started. The steak was perfect... in every way... nothing else to say... just plain perfect. Four exotic salts (Hawaiian, Volcano, Spicy, Smokey) accompany the steak in tiny dishes that allow you to pinch and sprinkle just the right amount for each bite.

The Truffle Pomme Frites we're delicious... as should everything thats been fried and topped with Truffle oil and grated parmesan cheese.

The Truffle Potato Puree was extremely delicious but also very heavy. Just make sure to plan on sharing this dish with someone else or plan on bringing some home.

The Grilled Asparagus was... well... grilled asparagus, enough said.

For dessert we wen't the the Pine Nut Tart and the Berry + Ricotta. The Pine Nut Tart was a fancy version of a pecan pie and was paired with a mascarpone ice cream and a cranberry chutney.

The Berry + Ricotta came with Lavender Honey, Mint, and Biscotti Crumbles which was great, but I felt myself wishing I had went with the Chocolate Cake instead.

We've eaten our way across Charlotte, through Charleston, in and out of D.C., etc... and have eaten at plenty of Steak houses. EVOKE stood out to us as a favorite for its perfectly prepared NY Strip Steak, bacon flavored shitake mushrooms, and selection of exotic salts. Whether you're from out of town or living right down the street, EVOKE should be on your short list of restaurants to check out very soon."}
{"text":"Our family enjoyed our Christmas luncheon at this restaurant. Tasty beef tenderloin and the wild mushroom is really good"}
{"text":"Great food.  Had the petite filet and it was delicious.  Excellent service.  Definitely on the pricey side."}
{"text":"The only reason this review got 3 stars is because the service was good.  Not phenomenal, but good.  Please don't waste your time as there are so many better places to eat in Charlotte and the price was ridiculous.  We started with the duck confit and the halibut ceviche.  Husband said the ceviche was straight lime juice and that the sweet potato chips were over seasoned.  The duck confit was just disappointing.  The texture of canned cat food and the pomegranate sauce was too tart.  Never in my life have I been disappointed in a dry aged steak.  I am not sure how it's possible.  The flavor on the steak was over powering and the steak was not the perfect slab of buttery perfection I had hoped for.  Especially at a $50 price tag.  The truffle pomme frites were cold when they arrived and over seasoned with truffle.  It was all I could taste for the rest of the night.  Total with 20% tip was $190.  No alcohol.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"I am so glad that this restaurant opened up. Definitely adding some competition to the current Charlotte/NC restaurant world. Offers valet parking service too so you don't have to worry about parking, especially knowing the fact that Evoke is in Uptown Charlotte and any parking is a hot commodity. 

DECOR and AMBIENCE:  Impressively ultra-modern, spacious, but yet intimate ambience.  Great place for an intimate group and couples, or just for yourself to freely indulge. 

LIBATIONS and EDIBATIONS:  Distinctive, premium wine selections and staffed with true mixologists (not just bartenders).  Don't come Evoke and expect to pay non-premium prices - This is rightfully so an ultra-lounge / restaurant, so Expect a Premium Level of modern-stylized food and beverage, which is what you unfailingly get here.  All ingredients are rigorously sourced locally, nationally, and globally while maintaining freshness and quality.  I had the bucatini and gnocchi were excellent - delicious and high-quality (all pastas offered are freshly made by a chef whom is fully dedicated to making all of the offered pasta). Crudos (I had the hamachi & escolar) were very exciting, comprised of fresh, bright, and harmonious flavors all together.  I will come back to try out additional items on the menu, especially the steaks! 

SERVICE:  Our server was extremely patient and communicative.  The entire front of the house was very attentive (not overly), polite, and respectable-looking.  I enjoyed the service which made the overall Evoke experience memorable and fun. 

I highly recommend this modern Italian steakhouse as your next self-indulgent, fine-dining experience!"}
{"text":"Got the rib eye, creamed spinach and brussel sprouts! AMAZE BALLS!! 

Bill and Stacey are the best!"}
{"text":"Unless you're trying out for the debate team and enjoy trivial arguments with strangers over erroneous topics, I would avoid this place. 
 
I wasn't going to write this review, but after trying to shake the experience like waking from a bad dream, I looked up Evoke's existing Yelp reviews and felt compelled to write about the absolute bonkers experience that was last night. 
 
We ordered \"the sea food stack\" described as \"squid ink pasta / blue crab / shrimp / parmesan breadcrumbs\" (see three quarters of the way down in the menu picture). What we received was globs of cheese, a piece of shrimp diced 3 ways and dark blue tortilla chips (again, see picture).
 
After disassembling the concoction in search of pasta, we starting thinking this was a mistake, a mere mix up with our order in the back or something. So we asked the server if this was correct. He said it was. With our jaws halfway to the floor, I asked why there wasn't any pasta in the dish. Immediately he said \"I'll get the manager\". Thinking I'm in the upside down world, the manager comes out, reinstates that the order is in fact correct, that this blue-corn tortilla chip with globs of indiscernible cheese is the seafood stack squid ink pasta, listed on the menu for $16.
 
After politefully skirting a few more questions like \"What do you mean this is pasta?\" and \"Don't you think the description is a bit misleading?\", the manager asserted that the cracker-like tortilla imposter was just like a lasagna noodle. That's when I picked up the suspect square and snapped it in half, ineffectively pointing out to the manager that \"pasta isn't supposed to snap in half\". Even with the residual alien cheese soaking through, the substance was clearly still crisp and still vert clearly not pasta. Without even flinching, the manager said \"yes, well it has all the ingredients of pasta, it has flour, squid ink and water\". My date and I incidentally laughed out loud at this assertion and subsequently realized we weren't going to win this one. Not in the upside down world. With that, our mouths returned to their resting upright position and swiftly ended the great pasta debate of 2018 and asked for the check.
 
The manager offered to bring something else out, recommend the Stroganoff but having debated the definition of pasta with what felt like an unyielding slab of granite, we repeatedly asked for the check fearful of what their definition of Stroganoff would be.
 
So what prompted me to write this lengthy review? Well, if you scroll down, you'll see a lovely, well-written review by a \"Elicit F.\" (also included, a picture of her review just in case). In her review, she has a picture of the actual squid ink pasta! With actual PASTA! Proof! We were hoodwinked. Bamboozled. Confirmed: upside down world.
 
After paying the bill we went straight to Desano for pizza. If you're still remotely considering visiting Evoke after reading this review, I would recommend you save yourself the hassle and just head straight to Desano for pizza instead.
 
The End."}
{"text":"Overrated it's very Fu Fu if you want to be full this isn't the place to go and only have a app, main course and dessert. The courses are baby sized, my newborn eats more than what's provided on the plate.

If you are looking for a very intimate and upscale looking place to go to this place is the place as long as you are not to hungry.

The 3 stars stem from the flavor of the items we tried in conjunction with the ambiance of the bar area and restaurant. Honestly if I was only rating in flavor and ambiance I would have to give this place 4.5 stars.

We had the Peruvian ceviche as an app and it was AMAZING. We moved to our main course and I tried the Crab Gnocchi which was delicious but extremely small. My husband had squid ink pasta with some type of meat I'm not sure if it was seafood or poultry. All in all the food was tasty but the portion size sucked."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last week for restaurant week. We were greeted as we walked towards the restaurant and seated promptly, but our server took too long to come to our table and get a drink order. Another staff member brought out bread and water, but never mentioned anything about our server. We had plenty of time to look over the menu, but it would have been better with a drink in hand. However, the food came out at a nice pace and was delicious. I had the sweet potato ravioli to start, and it was fantastic. The swordfish entree was great too, the fish was cooked perfectly. My bf's steak (ribeye medallions) came out before the arrangement of salts, so he initially thought it was bland. The variety of salts really enhanced the flavor of the steak, and he completely changed his mind about the dish. The wine list was nice, and I liked the option of a wine flight so I could try several varietals. Overall, we had a great experience, I guess I was a little impatient at first. Would like to return to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"It's very pretentious...food is not great and way overpriced!

Bar makes really tasty drinks. It's the only reason to come back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Evoke and it was fantastic.  We will definitely be back again.  Our server, Shabriea, was awesome.  She had great recommendations for beverages and dinner.  The brussel sprouts, broccolini and  pommes frites were all fantastic.  I had the gnocchi and my husband had the New York Strip.  Our friends got the scallops and rib eye.  She also brought us a complimentary champagne toast.  It was a great night!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is confused about its concept and the food tries way too hard. It's a combo of small plates and full meals. But the full meals come out as they are made just like the small plates. It's fun that way when you're all sharing small plates, but when ordering a full meal people will either have to eat alone or wait until the other food arrives. 
We ordered MANY things from the menu and of the 10 or so items we tried I probably only liked 2 and I wasn't wowed by anything.  The little extra things that should elevate the food instead overwhelms everything. A huge majority of the food has a smoke flavor that is overwhelming and kills your palette quickly.  Our waiter was kind but even he was a bit confused about the food. Announcing plates as something they were not. There were a few people at the bar so maybe it's good for that - but otherwise we were hugely disappointed and will not be back. The best part of our evening was the laughs we had about the ridiculous food. It's safe to say Charlotte has much better offerings than Evoke."}
{"text":"Wow. A bit expensive even by steakhouse standards, but everything was delicious. The ribeye was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the truffled mash potatoes and creamed spinach were great too. Plus live music while you eat never hurts. The very high cost is the only thing making this a 4 instead of a 5"}
{"text":"This restaurant was just ok for me.  The staff was really nice.  Our waiter was very knowledgable and attentive.  The ambiance is great with a very relaxed vibe.  The food, however, leaves much to be desired.  My friends and I went during restaurant week.  We all ordered something different and not one of us left impressed.  Although the menu itself looks appetizing, the food when it comes out is very bland.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it taste bad, you just can't taste anything at all.  It's like all the seasonings were removed from the kitchen staff.  The portions are also very small so plan to order many items if you're hungry.  There wasn't really one thing on the menu that stood out.  The dessert was probably the worst thing on the menu.  It was far from a treat.  I wouldn't decide to go again on my own.  The only way I would go back is if a friend was having a birthday dinner there that I had to attend... and even then, I would eat before I left the house.  Very disappointing for such a swanky restaurant with such a great vibe and staff."}
{"text":"Very well done at each course, the drawback is small plates are spendy.  Start with Ceviche, it was awesome and completely different that what I've had in California, David had a petite filet which was petite. They serve \"flavored salts\" on the side which were a local treat.  I had medallions in Madeira wine cream sauce over linguine. It was very good.  We topped it off with a dark chocolate brownie and an Irish Coffee.  Dinner for two was $150 very good service."}
{"text":"I give three stars. Mainly because my two experiences here were SO vastly different. And if all came down to the service. 

I went one night for a late dinner. I had been working all day and my coworker and I wanted a nice meal. We were staying at the Le Meridien so decided not to travel to far.

I had the afternoon on the grass cocktail which was fabulous and then we had a bottle of Malbec between us per he suggestion of the bartender bill. Bill did a fantastic job of keeping us fed and watered. 

I started with the ceviche and it was delicious! Followed that with the petite filet with the frites and brocolini. And all of that was absolutely delicious. The frites were AMAZING. and for dessert we split the espresso torte. We asked for an extra scoop of ice cream to try the gelato flavored and Bill hooked us up! Dinner was delicious and I also got it for room service another night while on the trip. 

....but breakfast was a different story. It took 20 minutes just to receive waters and orange juice! And an additional 20 to get our order taken. The food was good - I had the mini waffles. But nothing to write home about. And then we were left waiting for about 20-25 minutes once we asked for the check. And the worst part is there were other tables who got their food before us. Leaving us to believe our server just bit off more than she could chew that AM. 

Also every table we sat at wobbled. Not sure what that was about."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had in my entire life , and good other stuff too I wish I could have it every night. The steak was nice and and juicy , we got the Ribeye and crab gnocchi and shared that and a few other things. Will be. Ack very soon."}
{"text":"My sister and I dined at Evoke for restaurant week. First, the positives. Our server was friendly and attentive, my sister enjoyed her cocktail, and the place has a cool, modern ambiance. 

The food? Mehhh. It wasn't bad, but I expected better. We started with complimentary pork rinds and glazed cornbread. The pork rinds tasted like...well....pork rinds, and the cornbread was just okay. The cornbread had bacon in it but you couldn't taste it. 

Then came the appetizers. I had three baked oysters which were actually quite tasty. Unfortunately they were served on the nastiest smelling pile of seaweed I've ever encountered. My sister had cheerwine glazed pork ribs and they were rubbery.

My sister ordered the fluke as her main course, and while the portion was small, it was a good dish. I had the country fried steak which was all batter and very little steak. I didn't finish it. 

Dessert came in miniature mason jar type things. Mine was cookies and cream (too rich) and my sister had the lemon tart one. I think at $30 a head, they could give us a full dessert. Plus, the miniature mason jars weren't really functional because the spoon we were given was too big to reach to the bottom. 

Not a terrible experience, but not a great one. There's potential here but they're trying too hard to be unique. I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"I was a guest in the restaurants hotel and wanted to treat myself to a quality meal. I was not disappointed! I ordered the halibut by a suggestion from Stacy. She then suggested a wine pairing that I would not have even considered! I'm glad I followed her advice because it accompanied the meal perfectly. I decided to add the carrot and ginger soup as an appetizer. I enjoyed it but wish the portion was a little larger. For desert the pear cake was a little disappointing. It was a little dry and the caramelized pears a bit off tasting. All in all a pleasant dining experience I enjoyed the meal and even got a scallops recipe from Stacy. Thank you for the wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Was Fortunate to attend a soft opening of the new menu.  Oh my goodness it was excellent.  At the bar I enjoyed a Kindred Spirit, bourbon, amaro,spiced syrup, and smoked air.  Heavenly!! We tasted many small plates which were all fabulous, my favorite was the seafood lasagna and steamed shelis.  Also recommend the veggie basket and seared fluke.  Intimate atmosphere, great vibe, attentive service and will be back!"}
{"text":"Best waiting staff, amazing staggered display and presentation. The food is small yet filling with creative and great tasting sauces. Order the cornbread and the octopus with friend okra."}
{"text":"As one of 'CLTs to 50 restaurants', I expected a little more...maybe it was the lack of patrons (pretty empty for a Sat night, most likely since it's in a hotel a little off the main beat and path?), or the cold treatment from the restaurant manager when seating us and addressing one of our concerns, but overall wasn't the great/fun night we were hoping for. Overall, the food was good (I definitely recommend the Peruvian ceviche), but nothing else really stood out as a show-stopper. Agree w/other comments that portions are small (I actually like that - get to taste more without over-induldging), but the lack of up-beat atmosphere, location and patronage does not inspire me to return."}
{"text":"This place needs to do work.  First of all no valet on Saturday evening.  The door doesn't even open correct.  Seafood wasn't fresh and service was poor.  Don't waste your time or money.  This restaurant is running on borrowed time!"}
{"text":"Great hotel restaurant tucked away in the back of the Le Meridien lobby.  In terms of hotel restaurants, it's among the best - excellent steak, fresh seafood and high quality across the board.  The staff is also excellent - friendly, accommodating and come across as genuinely good people (thank you Amy!).  

The burrata salad is among my favorites, as was the steak and gingerbread cake.  All very tasty and probably caused me to eat more than I needed to.  

Decor is modern, comfortable and quiet - perfect for a nice catch-up with colleagues or a place to work in the evening instead of your room.  You won't feel out of place dining along either."}
{"text":"Actually staying in the Le Meridian for the weekend and decided to get some drinks at the bar. Highly recommend the Lavender Cosmo. I also really enjoyed the Afternoon on the Green Lawn. Hubby had a margarita and the Xavier Seduction. Great service!"}
{"text":"2 stars is generous
Over priced food
Mediocre service at best

Venture out of the hotel.  Next time i will for sure. All this place has going for it is convenience."}
{"text":"For first time visitors, Evoke is tucked away inside of the Le Meridien hotel, just behind the lobby. Atmosphere is very modern, not loud at all, but the restaurant is not that large. Therefore you still feel very much inside of a hotel lobby. 

Their Peruvian Ceviche is a must try if you like ceviche. Very fresh with the right amount of spice from the habanero peppers, topped with crunchy shavings of sweet potatoes which adds great texture with a hint of sweetness. 

The dish I anxiously wanted to try was the Squid Ink pasta since my first exposure to the dish was in Venice, Italy a few months ago. Other than black beans, it's very rare to see black colored food on our plates. So before trying this dish, there's a strong sense of curiosity since we eat with our eyes first! For those who have never tried this dish before, there is no need to worry about the pasta having a \"fishy\" taste. However, the pasta does have a slight brine/salty/sea like flavor, harmonizing beautifully with the small Bay scallops on this dish. My only disappointment with this dish was pasta seemed to have absorbed a lot of the sauce making it very stiff upon serving . This dish is not for everyone but certainly worth a try if you're a foodie or enjoy seafood.  The flavors were very fresh and I would try this dish again next time I visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely deserves five stars or more if I could give them. The waitstaff and bartenders are so friendly and professional you feel like they truly want you to have a great experience. The food was truly amazing. The Burrata salad I wish I could eat every day. By far the best I've ever had. We have never tried sweetbreads, those were equally amazing. We also had the pork belly, it was like butter that melted in your mouth.We were looking for a truly great steak restaurant and definitely not disappointed. I cannot say enough about Evoke, except if you don't try it you are definitely missing out on one of the best dining experiences in Charlotte!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Evoke for breakfast when staying at the Meridien. 

Breakfast: For my SPG platinum gift I'll usually take the breakfast option because I've found you can pretty much spend anything within reason. I've had most items on the breakfast menu: pancakes, lox and bagel, eggs and sausage, oatmeal, yogurt etc etc. The pancakes are definitely different -- brioche inspired, and not my favorite, but I could see how someone could them. The lox is hit or miss, which honestly is expected outside of NYC. The eggs are too buttery for my taste, but the sausage is excellent! Finally, the oatmeal is seriously sweetened with this lavender honey (not my thing!) so beware, and the yogurt is just yogurt, but it's always presented nicely!! 

The service is very amicable, but it's not super fast -- budget around 30 min to get in and out. In addition, if you didn't have a breakfast coupon, Evoke is pretty $$$ for a simple breakfast so it might not be worth it. Then again, there's not much else in the area, so could be your best bet!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal on Saturday. The team was about to close shop since they weren't busy but the manager decided to stay open upon our request. And slowly third of the space filled up. It's an upscale place but the food is well thought out and the value is great for the ingredients used, and the cooking techniques displayed. 
Loved it. They also took care of our parking ticket. 
The hotel lobby is beautiful"}
{"text":"We were lured to Evoke by their rating in Charlotte Magazine and Restaurant Week was an added carrot.

Since our reservation was at the tail end of the great snow of 2016 they called to confirm our reservation- very thoughtful!

The lobby is gorgeous - very relaxing to hang out before or after dinner. Evoke is tucked in the back left corner at a kinda awkward host stand. 

Service was divine- we were seated quickly, greeted warmly and educated on the menu. I loved that they offered wine, beer and whiskey flights. Our table tried a cocktail, wine flight and OMB beer flights.

Food was executed well in maybe the most well timed dinner I've ever had out. Why only three stars? Nothing felt innovative, special or surprising. Do all three of those words mean the same thing?

Yes the salmon crudo was lovely, if tiny. Sauces were also quite nice.

Proteins were cooked well, apps were delicious and I was the lone person to love my dessert (brown butter cake with Nutella gelato - amazing!) The gelato and sorbet assortment wasn't served on a chilled plate and melted quickly. And at a several hundred dollar dinner it's those things that make a difference.

In a sea of fine dining options consistent is good, yes but there are so many choices in Charlotte now and I want see something on a menu in a new preparation.

This wasn't a bad meal - just not worthy of a top five restaurant in Charlotte. Come here for a solid meal and great service- plus it's a terrific deal during Restaurant Week. Save your special night out dinner budget for Passion 8, Fig Tree, Customshop, Wooden Vine or Carpe Diem."}
{"text":"The hotel & the restaurant are super cool & awesome. But because this hotel used to have a reputation for guns & thug violence during CIAA the Security is kind of like The Nazis. If you aren't wearing a suit & look all Bank Of America Corporate prepare to be asked multiple times if you are a guest & staying at the hotel. Can you tell us your name & room number & show us you ID & your room key. I would rather chill at EpeCentre & not be hassled by the Adolf Hitler Nazis that run this hotel's Security. If you can afford to eat there you can afford to stay there too, but if I'm a local & live in Dilworth I'm not paying $250 per night for a room so I can eat at an overpriced snobby restaurant with average food & stuckup servers."}
{"text":"All of the food we ate had promise.  Even though most of it was served after it had obviously sat on a counter for a long period of time, you could still tell that each dish was unique and flavorful.  However, because of the service, we'd need a very compelling reason to ever go back given the remaining competition in Charlotte.  For the two of us, appetizers took an hour to arrive at the table (and they weren't busy).  To his credit, the waiter did recognize this and made up with two additional glasses of the wine we were drinking (forgivable error).  Then our main courses both came out at a medium temperature at best.  Similar results with the dessert (half of my wife's sorbet was already melted 50% of the way).  My cocktail order for dessert took over 10 mins to receive, as our waiter took approximately 15 mins to get down the order for the 8-person table next to us.  Eventually, another server brought the drink.  They also managed to hose up the parking validation, so we dropped an extra $5 for a good kick on the way out.  This is going to be a $100 meal for two (more with cocktails or wine).  No way I'd recommend this place to a friend unless I had gone back and seen the service pick way up.  But again, I'm not dropping another $100 or more to find out."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's Day dinner and I usually don't like prefixed menus. However, the food was fantastic. Great blend of flavors! I cut my steak with a butter knife. AMAZING! Our server was great and suggested one of the best wines I ever tasted! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Looking for dinner on a Wednesday evening, Evoke located in the Sheraton Charlotte Hotel was a nice choice.  Looking at the menu there were a few interesting choices, but I settled on the Country Fried Steak.  Not your traditional style, but tasty none the less.  As some of my colleagues food orders started to arrive, I was a little concerned with how much food would come out.  Evoke has a tapas style combined with a fusion kinda thing going on.  The waitress tried to explain it to us, but we were all busy talking.  So we ordered a few other side dishes to share - the fingerling potato's were a nice fit with my country fired steak.

They have a full bar, but also have Pepsi products - gotta have my Mt. Dew!

We didn't try Desert, but the meals itself was very good!"}
{"text":"This place has potential but need a little work. The service was good and drinks where reasonable. Food was just alright went for Resturant week and had the country fried steak don't recommend that but everything else was good. Not sure this is a place I would go back to though"}
{"text":"Excellent crudo, pasta, truffle fries, scallops and salted caramel budino.  Delicious!!  Service was excellent!  Finally, Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked wings, badly seasoned, the honey whatever sauce is not better than buffalo, so theres no point to it. $12 for 8 wings, too much for scraps. Crab lump deviled eggs, good idea again, nice ingredients, bad execution. Watery deviled yolk, the egg white texture was too hard and the lump of crab should be a few smaller pieces instead of the big lump. I could make better versions of each of these dishes for 1/4 the price. Maybe ill come back and try menu items with more yelp mentions."}
{"text":"I wish I had anything redeeming to say about our dinner out at Evoke. Ambiance is so-so. You are pretty much in the hotel lobby. Cocktails were fine, but pricey (as expected in Uptown). Food was really bad. My husband and I shared 5 small plates and enjoyed only one...the burrata salad (which is basically a caprese that can't be messed up!)  Beware of the asparagus topped w/ fried quinoa. We felt in danger of breaking teeth.  The flavored table salt options are a nice idea, until we realized how potentially contaminated the small open dishes  (covered w/ a piece of cardboard) with a small spoon for application are. We started sampling and then imagined the grubby fingers before us doing the same...ew!  On top of all, we had a remarkably annoying server. At one point we thought maybe we were being \"punked\".  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"This is difficult review to write because there was a lot great but also a lot wrong with our dinner here. First of all, the chef here knows his stuff and puts out delicious dishes. We started with cocktails and ordered the Crudos, which they are famous for.
We had the Peruvian Cerviche which was delicious and properly prepared. We also had an order of Nairagi (marlin) which was also very nice  and enough to share for two. For our entrees, we ordered two pasta dishes - the Agnolotti and the Spaccatelli.
Both were delicious in flavor. The swiss chard+pancetta as a side was also very tasty.
Here comes the criticisms. Price point and portion sizes. Appetizers were priced and portioned correctly. Our entrees were not. Though seeming inexpensive, the pasta dishes at $16 and $15 respectively were EXTREMELY small in portion. The Agnolottii was done in 4 forkfuls. Not much better on the Spaccatelli. There was less than 2 oz of food on my plate! I came here to eat. Bread service for two was brought to the table with 3 pieces. 3 pieces for 2 people? Either bring 2 or 4, not 3! Who gets the third piece?! The wine selection was good except for the fact that one one or two offerings of \"by the glass\" for each variety. And the prices were astronomical! They had a glass of Justin Cabernet priced at $20!!!! This is a wine I drink at home often and it costs $25 per bottle retail all day long. This is clearly a rip off. I had to chose the least expensive Cabernet just because of the pricing. All the wines were priced like this. Way too high. Our server was a very sweet young lady who just was not up to the job for a restaurant of this caliber. She spoke in an inaudible whisper and it was plain to see she was inexperienced. For a restaurant of this price point and quality, I expect a server that knows the restaurant in and out and can \"tell and sell\" the menu. The owner needs to invest in better wait staff. The current do not match the rest of the restaurant. It was Friday night at 7 PM and there were 2 other tables being served on arrival. Two more than that when we left. Why so empty? For all the reasons above apparently. Too pricey for too small portions. Killer formula. Sadly, we not be returning."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is gorgeous!!! It is straight out of a \"Mad Men\" set as others have said before me. The flavors in all of our Restaurant week were EXCELLENT but the portions were super small... even for restaurant week. Our waitress was polite and sweet but the kitchen was extra slow on getting our meals out. We will definitely come back but might have a snack at home first ;)"}
{"text":"Dinner and Breakfast were both very good!
Cornish Hen (yes, I know dinner time is a Steakhouse) was awesome, great service, good started salad - much enjoyed!
Breakfast of an egg white omelette, grapefruit juice, with potatoes on the side, while \"simple\" was very good!"}
{"text":"5 stars does not cut it for this place. We went on a date for my girlfriends birthday and the wait staff was not only helpful in recommendations, but they were absolutely friendly. Our server was Joey and he was extremely knowledgeable of he menu. They are all about courses so we went along with it and got a few things...

We started out with a romaine salad, which had pepato  cheese, roasted tomatoes and romaine lettuce. Fresh salad and very flavorful with the roasted tomatoes and goat cheese.

Next we had the gnocchi with lump crab and panchetta... lemon sauce and homemade gnocchi were definitely paired perfectly.

For our main dish we had the 6oz filet mignon and they were buttery goodness cooked to perfection. Joey brought out some finishing salts, and one of them was lava salt... very interesting, but was a take on a coarser sea salt. A must try.

We had a bottle of the Storypoint Cabernet 2014... perfect with the dishes we ordered. 

To top everything off they brought my girlfriend a delicious chocolate cake with a candle for her birthday.

Their attention to detail and excellent customer service makes for an amazing night out as well as great food. Definitely worth the money. I will be back next time we are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for restaurant week. The food was some of the best I have ever had and our waitress was fantastic. The portions aren't huge but it forces you to slowly savor every bite. They gave us a number of different salts to try with our steak, something I've never had before but greatly enjoyed. I'm too cheap to go here when pricing is regular but I will definitely go back for another restaurant week. Only 2 issues. First, one of my friends and I who got there early were ignored at the bar for 20 minutes until we finally grabbed a waitress in the serving area of the bar. When the bartender she got hold of finally did come to us, he was super apologetic. We thus chalked it up to them still getting their feet wet and figuring out better how to manage a large crowd. Second, I would not recommend the Citrus Olive Oil Cake. What came out looked like a pre-packaged muffin you could get at any gas station. Other than that though, everything we had was delicious, everyone there was incredibly friendly and we were made to feel very welcome (even if a little delayed in the bar area!)."}
{"text":"We went to this place after checking in to our hotel late. Very expensive. We ordered a simple Mac n cheese for our kids and it was terrible and way undercooked. The overpriced steak we ordered was so fatty and over seasoned. Not much of a selection."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant after getting all the awesome reviews. This is definitely a place to bring your expense account though!

Went on a Friday night and it was slow. The service was attentive. The decor was nice and modern.

Started off with the frisée salad, which was not bad, little too much dressing for my taste. I moved on to the squid ink tagliatelle which was very good, had a nice hint of spice which was surprising. Moved on to the crown jewel: the 21 day aged strip... and it was very good! The server gave us four different kinds of salts for the table and it was fun to play around with the tastes. 

I was extremely disspointed with the wine by the glass. I think due to the fact that there isn't a lot of table turnover, I think the bottle was opened for a few days. It's was not a good experience. 

I found the sticker shock to the a downer, there are plenty of options at that level in Charlotte that I would go to instead."}
{"text":"David and team at Evoke made my husbands birthday absolutely amazing. The chef, Rodrigo, did a wonderful job on the food and all of it was great. I strongly suggest a visit here. The staff will really take great care of you. Chris was our server but you can tell when a team works together. I genuinely cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"It was a rainy cold night  when we ventured out for Queen Citys Restaurant week. Evoke a fairly new restaurant was set back in the  Le Méridien Charlotte. We had wanted to try it for some of the Unique new items on the 3 course menu. It was very quiet and not busy on this Thursday Night, which is kind of strange during Restaurant Week, but we were nicely surprised. We started out with an extra appetizer which was the Truffle Pommes , yes french fries with truffle salt and a house made ailoi which was delicous! We then varied which item  each of us ordered ( party of two ) so we could taste all the different items. We loved the Pasta  Alla Chitarra which was duck egg Carbonara, it was a nice size portion and the flavor was spot on! The Jerusalem Artichoke Parsnip Bisque was heavenly. One of the Unique things we recieved was a Salt tray, it was served with our Entree, which had Four different sea salts and each was a flavor explosion in your mouth! Really loved that! I got the Filet with Crispy Asparagus and My daughter got the Swordfish with Meyer Lemon and olives and salsify We topped off this dinner with their Salted Caramel Budino which was a wonderful rendition of one of my favorite desserts with homemade almond cookies on the side. Very modern, very chic and well worth the cost this is a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"So many things can be improved on and some things I don't think they can do anything about.  

First off, the food was good.  Although my steak came out a little overdone I still enjoyed the mushroom side as well as the yellow fin tuna appetizer I ordered.

The decor looks good if you don't look too closely.  What I mean is the ceilings look damaged in spots and the space has a general feel of trying really hard but the cracks still come through.  It is a trendy spot but until they figure out how to create a separate entrance it will always have a hotel-restaurant feel to it.  

The staff was pretty good, stumbling a bit but nothing critical done wrong.  

The real kicker for me was the beer selection.  The selection was fine actually but the pricing was WOW.  $19 for a 12 oz. bottle of a decent Stone beer?  Come on, that's a bit much.  I think the cheapest bottle of an IPA beer was $11.  In general, it is a pretty expensive place to eat and with all the other places to choose from Evoke is going to have an uphill battle finding patrons outside of those that are staying at the hotel.

PS.  $5 to  self park or $10 to valet."}
{"text":"I was a guest in the nearby Sheraton and ate here out of necessity. The food far exceeded my expectations. The roast chicken is fantastic.
Everyone here is delightful. Fantastic service."}
{"text":"Just amazing!  Perfect place for an anniversary dinner. On the pricey side but so worth it.  First,  it seemed as if I reserved the entire restaurant for hubby and I @ 7. But it just wasn't crowded on a Friday night. Its located in a hotel so most of the clientele are travelers.  I loved that because of the type of location.  Plus,  the attentiveness of the hostesses, bartenders, and servers were amazing. I think at least 5 different people came to us in the first hour.  

To start off, the drink was delicious!  We got a recommendation from the bartender who's a certified mixologist, who infuses his own Vodka. Just amazing. Name has escaped me but just ask for a \"sweet, STRONG combo\" and you won't be disappointed.  

Now on to the food...sides and apps are definitely enough to share, so we got a little of everything.  We got the Filet, Creamed Spinach, Gnocchi  (Daily Handmade pasta), and Truffle Fries. Between 2 people we had leftovers. Truffle fries should be sold in stores or home delivered because they were that good. And now that I've tasted homemade pasta, there's nothing like it. To top it all off, we got our anniversary dessert comped, a Butterscotch / Caramel melt with Shortbread Cookies. 

From walking in the door to leaving,  everything was great. Definitely a great, new local gem. Needs more advertising to the locals to keep it around. I would come back for sure and bring others."}
{"text":"Food good but the beer prices are crazy. 17 for a stone IPA.  The food, wine and mixed drink prices seem regular for an elegant restaurant but cannot get over a 20 dollar dogfish 90 minute bottle.

I suggest going to the other restaurant in the hotel."}
{"text":"I've been to Evoke a handful of times since they open, and I really love the place.  Can't understand why it's not more crowded!  Evoke markets itself as a chic, new-age steakhouse.  I'd say the emphasis is on the CHIC.  Great decor.  Some of my favorite dishes are:  Gnocchi with jumbo lump crab and smoked pancetta; Escolar Crudo; Peruvian Ceviche; Diver Scallop Crudo; beef tenderloin Bucatini; 21-day Dry-aged NY Strip."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here one week night when I wanted something yummy but didn't feel like going out. I ordered the Gnocchi and the Peruvian ceviche. The food was great. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 were the portion sizes. For the price I thought a little more could have been provided. Nevertheless I'd eat there again but wouldn't come hungry!"}
{"text":"Some of the best scallops I've had. However, I tried the swordfish and it was pretty bad. Also had the chicken which was good. I remember making reservations and the earliest reservation that they had was 9:30pm. It was almost entirely empty when we showed up for our reservation. The menu is also pretty pricey."}
{"text":"It's a nice bar (16 seats) & plenty of high & low tops, row tables and sofa seating in the bar area.  The small Evoke restaurant is past the bar area.  It's almost like a second lobby for le meridien.  The colors are very hotel but the dark neutrals with pops of yellow are well-done neo-modern.  Cozy chairs and sofa seating is good, and they replaced the teeny tip-over tables for a solid feel.

I've been for Art & Apertif which is fun as well as for apps & drinks.  Free Wi-Fi & they validate parking.

Classic drinks with some fresh ideas for summer specials.  Food is a twist on Southern with some fun ideas on apps.  

A good alternative between center city and Metropolitan.   They have the rooftop option as well.  See you at 5:05!"}
{"text":"Evoke, invokes a joke. To claim you are a steakhouse is beyond a joke. Everything Travis W said below applies. We could have had a better meal for much less elsewhere. If staying at the hotel don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Food is a la carte. Now I truly know what that means. Despite requesting to bring the chicken and potatoes out at the same time. They bring it roughly 15 minutes apart. $16for \"half of a rotisserie chicken\" was outrageous. It wasn't even a full half chicken it was 3 chicken pieces. #1hitterquiter"}
{"text":"Poor service.  Expect LONG waits.  Typical \"fancy\" restaurant with embellished descriptions far larger than the food itself.  If you stay here - avoid it.  Uber or walk to much better places.  

Music etc as annoying as the wait.  No thanks.  My one and only visit."}
{"text":"If you want a mediocre meal and then on top of it get ripped off.....go here. For a high price steak house this is your place. My bank notified me that this restaraunt charged me 3 times. I first spoke with Ken Lou  (from the restaraunt) who told me to not pay my credit card bill. I then spoke with restaurants manager Mohammed. He told me that his system only showed one transaction instead of three. Told him i was going to dispute the charges. He then became negative and cocky. Told him i was going to take my business elsewhere.....he encouraged it. When we were there, there was one other table. BUSINESS MUST BE GOOD.....if you want to get ripped off go here.....just expect to be charged three times...."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor service and worse food. Our server was disengaged and lacked knowledge on cocktails and beers. It took 15 minutes to have cocktails prepared, and we were the only guests in the restaurant...

The restaurant has tried to work a high end foodie menu, but the delivery is poor. Our food was unseasoned, burnt and the fish tasted old. We had the ceviche, mushroom crostini, Brussels sprouts and French fried. Definitely check out restaurants near the hotel because you'll regret this one! :("}
{"text":"This was awesome. Chef Rodrigo is so personable! The food delish (beef tenderloin pasta great) and service impeccable."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the hotel and had the pleasure of dining in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast.  We loved it!  For Dinner, Stacy and Adel assisted us and were very attentive and friendly.  Our meal was excellent.  My husband loved his steak (I thought the variety of salts they brought out were great!) and potato puree with truffle oil.  I had the scallop entrée, they were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the veggies they were paired with.  One of my favorite elements of the meal was the butter poached asparagus appetizer.  It was delicious and had a beautiful presentation.
For breakfast Ayalah was our server and she was equally as great (yay for good attentive service).  I had the Smoked Salmon Tartine and LOVED it!  I'm going to try and recreate it at home.  My husband had the belgian waffles and they were beautiful.   Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the food, the environment and the service.  Yay for another great hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in Le Meridien Charlotte (the old Blake), Evoke is a breath of fresh air. I have to admit, I am an SPG Platinum member and try to stay at one if their properties wherever I travel. After visiting the new property, I am ready for some staycations. Evoke did just what the name implies and brought out happy feelings from all my senses. Evoke focuses on prime and dry-aged steaks, house-made pastas and fresh crudo, sourced both locally and abroad. 
The setting is warm, yet chic  showcasing sleek furniture accented in dark woods and leather, grey and white fabrics and splashes of yellow throughout, with awesome lighting and lounge music pulsing. This is definitely not your daddy's steakhouse. The plates are just as slick as the setting, with splashes of color and vibrant flavors. I am so happy to have this as a new addition to the Charlotte culinary landscape. Overlook the hotel setting as this is on par with any of the other great dining spots in town."}
{"text":"I came here after DoorDash messed up my order from elsewhere to the Sheraton. This mess-up left me hungry and looking to grab a quick dinner. The host Cameron must've noticed that something was wrong and quickly sat me down and took my order (I ordered the gnocchi). No exaggeration but the food was out in less than 10 minutes which was awesome because I was starving. The food was great and the service amazing."}
{"text":"WOW!! The best petit filet I've ever had and that is saying something as I have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in the world. The Lobster app was a solid 4 stars, but, if you love steak and filets in particular, you have got to try this steak. Not that it needed it by any means, but they do bring out 4 different salts from around the world to compliment this amazing steak (I tried them all just for fun and they were good). Regardless, for a hotel restaurant, this place was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"SUCH AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE! came for my best friends birthday and they treated us like gold. i had the filet mignon and fingerling potatoes and it was amazing. definitely coming back! thiago was amazing give that man a raise!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the butcher burger ( medium) to go but instead what I got 40 mins after placing my order was a well done mediocre burger minus any garlic aoli, balsamic onions et. al. Maybe just an off day in the kitchen :("}
{"text":"Would be 4 or 5 but they gouge you at the bar. There is a beer there that I bought at Harris teeter for $14 for a four pack of tallboy cans.  Evoke bar has it priced at $39 for one. Insane. Shady. Will not patronize this hotel again. 6 months ago the manager said it was an error on the menu. Fat forward to today....still $39. Shame!"}
{"text":"So.....if you are looking for an elegant, cosmopolitan locale with a fantastic mixologist who is fun to talk with (Xavier), then this is your place.  We drifted through the evening with Jefferson whiskey infused with mint (me) and lavender infused cosmos (her).  It was the perfect evening!!!

Ask for Xavier!"}
{"text":"Pretty much sucked.  If were to rate it relative to the price it would definitely be just 1 star.  

The place was as bright as an operating room.  So that atmosphere was definitely not enjoyable. 

The service was really, really bad. Not rude mind you, just comically bad.   The place had recently opened so normally I'd cut them some slack.  But it was as though the apex of fine dining that the waitstaff had previously worked at was Bojangles.  Trying to ask for suggestion from the wine list was nothing short of absurd.  They could not have had less knowledge.  

Fortunately when the very high bill arrived (this was expected), I threw this sub par meal on the expense account.  There is absolutely Zero chance that I will ever come back here."}
{"text":"Made a reservation several days in advance on open table, only to show up and find that they are closed for maintenance. Poor customer service and won't be back to try the food."}
{"text":"Kappas had their monthly mixer at Evoke yesterday and this was the first time I had ever gone to Evoke. I am happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The wine list is a little over priced but my bartender kept me increasingly happy with my rum and cokes!  I had the Bucatini that so savory and delicious I wanted to kiss the chef:) I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A hidden gem of a place for Restaurant Week!  The food was absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous. And the service was great as well.  The place had been remodeled and looked very modern and nice.

Logistically this place could be a little better with the parking for those that do not stay at the hotel. Also the seating along the back - the chandeliers did not line up to the tables. And someone in our group hit their head as we got up to leave. 

Parking was also very confusing as the elevator in the garage took us all the way through the conference center and the adjacent hotel. This after paying for parking on the non busy 2nd Ward of Uptown."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on the food. The servers were all quite pretentious, looked at me like I was lost because I'm in jeans and a Columbia sweatshirt. IDGAF.  Actually find it quite amusing when servers are pretentious; you're a server. I ordered the chicken entree with dates and carrots. The chicken was very well cooked and tender and the dates added the perfect sweet. The baby carrots were out of this world good. I really enjoyed this healthy dish and would order it again. I'm tempted to go steak if I come back and I'll surely be drinking wine next time as well and I'd love to try the Brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week in Charlotte. This was a tough one to review. Evoke is a new restaurant with a ton of potential. The feel, decor, and ambiance is excellent. Ultra-modern and sleek. This might sound odd, but the music really doesn't match the scene. The service was a bit slow, but there were multiple individuals checking on us and that helped. The music was really odd though...can't get away from that. Back to what you really go to a restaurant for...the food. The food was spectacular. Sweet potato ravioli with bourbon butter sauce was unreal. I had the tenderloin medallions which are served with an assortment of various salts. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The desserts were good, nothing outrageous. The presentation on the dishes were really well done. 

Overall, a great restaurant with a ton of potential. Look forward to eating here in the future!"}
