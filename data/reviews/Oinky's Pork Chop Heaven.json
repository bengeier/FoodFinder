{"text":"When I say this is the nastiest chicken in the whole wide world and y'all know I support black businesses but I'm so mad I went there.. I asked them do they season the wings b4 or after they cook them and apparently they don't season them at all! And the wings taste like old burnt grease. So unappetizing.. the fries we black and soggy like they were refried 3 or 4 times but never will get hard.. I'm so upset I tried to support them but I guess I shouldn't have ordered chicken in a \"pork chop place\" ?"}
{"text":"Oinky's pork chop heavens food or soul food. Chicken and pork chops are cooked to order. Pork is main dish but it cant compete with the chicken. The side dishes like Mac and cheese lack in flavor. The greens, black eyed peas and cabbage are good. Pricey. Restaurant is new but I expect great things in the future."}
{"text":"** I also want to add this .. says they are open at 6am for breakfast daily .. do not be fooled .. I drive by this place M thru F each morning on my way to work well after 6am & they are NEVER open .. place is dark & empty so not sure who is serving breakfast if there is not a soul in sight"}
{"text":"This place is a cool joint that doesn't look down on me when I walk in wearing my flashy pimp suit, but I couldn't help but notice that there were little kids footprints on the counter where they place your food.  What's that about?"}
{"text":"I read the reviews for this place and I disagree with the person who said Oinky's should have more meat choices. It's pork chop heaven not Oinky's BBQ. Plus, I generally dislike restaurants that try to offer everything; stick with what you're good at.

Now for the food, it's amazing! Call it soul food or comfort food, doesn't matter. It's all good! Try the pork chops or chicken; you can't go wrong. And the sides are tasty also.

Try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
