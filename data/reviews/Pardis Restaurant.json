{"text":"New Persian restaurant in the area. I tried the Kubideh Kebab special $6.99 (2 skewers of grilled seasoned ground beef with rice and salad). 
My order was takeout, wait time approx. ten minutes. Inside restaurant very basic, clean,  friendly staff. 
Food was fresh, portion size was good for price, taste was good, meat was well spiced, not greasy, overall good healthy meal for the price.
4* rating was based on food quality/value for money..."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant today.
I was surprised by manners of the  arrogant owner, the guy who works at the counter.
Not just because  He does not say hello or thank you to the customers, but he lacks respect in the way he talks.
he was a complete yahoo.

food quality on the other hand was mediocre . I am not sure if they have a real chef in the kitchen.
I recommend any other Persian restaurant in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"When you're shopping in the area and hungry for a good meal, skip the McDonald's and check this place out. It's cheap but delicious, great, friendly service, family-owned, and offers a great variety of items. I had the kashk bademjan, which is a vegetarian-friendly eggplant dish, and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The owner is such a sweet man and the meals are very large and filling. A side salad come with every meal with a thousand island -type dressing and a generous portion of rice. The meat is so tender and flavor is one point. I had the meal number one on the menu. Must try!"}
{"text":"It really is as good as it gets when it comes to value. The best kebobs I have ever had. I usually order for takeout and its a big hit at home. Not sure how the do it but the beef is as juicy as can be. 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to get a quality lunch or dinner. The chicken wrap is a nice light lunch and the plates are perfect for dinner!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kubideh Kebab (beef). I got one regular and one spicy to try both. It came with rice, a BBQ'd tomato and a salad. 

I preferred the spicy kebab to the regular one. It wasn't too spicy, but had a nice kick. The rice is good. 

I ordered my meal as takeout and it took 30 minutes, rather than 15 which I was told. I also understand that it was the lunch rush and the food is cooked to order. 

Nothing overly wowed me but I will be back for reliable, good quality food."}
{"text":"This is my first time to try this place out even though its in my area! I'm so glad I did :-)

So if you live in this area long enough you probably have a nostalgia for a Quiznos in this plaza that closed few years ago, or maybe you forgot all about it and I just reminded you.

Back on track. This place has some high quality food for the price. Selection from Kubedeh and pulow to barg and sultani kabab. Meals are served on proper China plates and silverware. All meals are served with basmati rice and a choice of salad or a drink. Food tastes great and portions are huge. Price is reasonable.

Now the restaurant. Decor is pretty nice. Slow music playing in the background. Restaurant and washrooms are clean. Owner is a nice guy. Free WiFi always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Persian fast food can be considered healthy and is a great break from silicone covered chicken nuggets and bread buns

Take a husband and wife duo and a bbq grill and you are in business

Persian fast food is pretty much pita, rice, salad and kabobs and its variations

Not much processed or additive based

I had the #20 which had hot spices added into the ground beef for a spicy lunch

I love how home made food tastes so much better when cooked up from scratch and made with love"}
{"text":"One day I was roaming around the plaza looking for a food restaurant to eat lunch. I stumbled upon Pardis. Ive never ate persian food before. I ordered  the beef kabab thing with rice and a salad. The flavors of the meat was amazing. I fell in love. I went back the next day order the chicken kabob. Again, I was so impressed with the chicken kabob as well. I did notice how clean and bright the restaurant was. That's the main thing I look into when I go visit a restaurant."}
{"text":"Cheapest and best Iranian kabob house. They have all the staples at amazing prices and they actually have a dining room unlike their competition up the street. The food is always ready very quickly and you do not have to deal with 1,000 people in their dining room because most customers are taking food out.
Try the Sultani for a feast or for under $10 get Kubidah which is beef on rice  with salad.
tasty"}

Pardis Restaurant has a quite simple menu similar to other Persian restaurants in the area. However, $6.99 for beef kekab? Definitely something worth coming here for!

The interior is clean and welcoming. I was a little confused thought it is a self serve/takeout place but in fact it is a full service restaurant.

My Beef Kebab was made to order served to me hot off the grill and well seasoned! Portion was good and talking about value! 

Definitely worth checking this place out if you in the neighborhood!"}
