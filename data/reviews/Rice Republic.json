{"text":"Not sure why anyone would give this more than 1 star.  Soup tasted like nasty dish water.   Everyone at our table commented the same thing. Much better choices in Vegas. Will never return.  No kids menu. Had to get my son pizza."}
{"text":"It's a cute but overpriced Chinese / Taiwanese restaurant with slightly better than mediocre food.  We tried a variety of items including their XLB (juicy pork dumplings), shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, bbq pork and spicy wontons.  Everything was ok but not great, definitely not worth the price tag.  There was barely 10 tiny, thin slivers of pork for the $10.88 price tag. We're big foodies and it was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews before going to eat here. We went for dim sum cart service that was advertised on the menu with 20 items. There were only ten items. And the cart service was a joke. Worst dim sum that I have ever ate."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice; friendly employees, the cleanliness of the restaurant is a plus.  The food has good flavor. I highly recommend the pot stickers to try. Tables are a little small; usually when Asians eat in we like to order a la carts we need a lot of space to put our food. Overall a good new modern Asian restaurant.  I really appreciate that you can actually see the chefs cooking."}
{"text":"Horrible! The food was bland! The portion was small for the price! And they seemed very pushy and made us feel rushed!  Never coming back here! Eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service! They had one little man waiting the whole restaurant, one host and one woman running the food. One mother and daughter couple waited 40 minutes for a bowl of noodles with shrimp. Several other tables left because no one had approached them for quite some time. We ordered the dim sum because we figured it would be quick and we were done eating before our drinks came. I blame this on very poor management not hiring enough servers for a busy day. Shame on the managers!!!"}
{"text":"People have such high standards these days. If the food tastes good the service was above average and the place was clean, I think your going on an inner yelp power trip. 

This place is in Downtown Summerlin. The food was good, the dim sum was unique to the area. It's a smaller venue but the outdoor space is a welcome to change to many restaurants who should but don't have and outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"I was lucky to wind up here for lunch today with some friends. We all had a great time. The food was delicious. Rice Republic has a very comfortable and inviting atmosphere. Tables seemed to be turned over quickly. This place seemed to have short waits to get a table. The staff were great, the girls were very pretty, especially the one with the braces. We all had to try a few things from the dim sum cart before we ordered. I got the shrimp fried rice with egg & veggies. It came out crisp and full of flavor. A photo of my meal should be attached."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here this past Monday and it was a great meal. We typically go to Chinatown for dim sum and I'm so glad we have a place in Summerlin now. We had the Shu Mai, Chinese pancake, Gyoza, steamed dumplings and Taiwanese Dandan noodles. My boyfriend is half Taiwanese and he loved the Taiwanese specialties. Lisa the assistant manager was very helpful and kind. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Really surprised with the positive reviews.  This place is definitely not good Chinese food - you'd be better off at Panda Express across the parking lot.

Restaurant is small - has three doors and outside seating - big glass wall to outside. There is a \"bar\" to sit and eat as well with stools where you can watch them cook.  All wait staff and host are Chinese - cooks were Mexican...???......

We ordered Hong Kong Wonton Soup - $10.88- had no taste - basically like water.  Well, I take that back - it had cilantro in it - so it tasted like cilantro water.

Rest of dinner (for 3) was Shredded Chicken Breast with Ginger (mostly all rice and greens - very little chicken - no ginger taste) $8.88, Minced Pork over Rice (totally ginger - in fact, it was like I was sucking on ginger root) $8.88, and Sliced Beef with Sukiyaki Sauce (tasted like pot roast)$9.99.  Portions were small.  Everything came in a bowl - just about everything had cilantro on it.  We left hungry - everyone.

Hot tea was $3.88.... I still can't get over a Chinese restaurant charging for hot tea.
No fortune cookies either.

Staff was nice - but waiter kept rushing us through the meal - the place was not full, certainly enough seating.  

We were laughing:  staff went to Wetzel's Pretzels for THEIR dinner and ate it in restaurant next to diners.  Tacky.  And says a lot about their own food!

Honestly - pass on this place. I do not see it lasting very long!"}
{"text":"Loved their dumplings and their customer service. Especially their employee Rithy. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon and the patio was great... sadly the food lacked inspiration.  

We ordered 2 different dumplings, mine arrived immediately but was barely warm... my wife's took a good 10mins to arrive.   They both were delicious.  

Both our main dishes (house special noodles and sesame noodles) were bland and it was only after adding tons of soy sauce and Sriracha that we could get any actual flavor out of the dish. 

... and it took a good 20mins for them to clear out after our plates/bowls were empty and another 10mins before the check arrived."}
{"text":"Not a fan, what so ever. I don't leave reviews, but they left an impression on my friends and I. We had to ask to be seated. After about 10 minutes we had to ask to be served, and the gentleman was reluctant to do so. He was impatient and rude. We asked for napkins, and never received them. They did not refill our drinks once and never came to check on us. After a terrible dining experience, we left an appropriate tip. And instead of the typical check grab after we've left the table, he grabs it and walks away, saying nothing. I see him stop to look and he turns around and slams the tip on the table for us to take back, as if our money is an insult. We left the money. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Luv and Rithy are amazing, they make you feel very comfortable and welcome! The pork dumplings come with amazing dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"I would have chosen one star but most of the staff was friendly so I gave it two stars. We were looking forward to eating here. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the food.  The dim sum was just ok. The dan dan noodles had no taste, almost like they forgot to season it. The chicken with ginger sauce was terrible. We ordered another noodle dish that was like having cooked noodles with a dash of soy sauce. We did not try any of the soup dishes so maybe there is hope there, but we won't be returning. I don't mind paying more for good food but this wasnt worth it.  
The jasmine tea was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"The service was quite curt and pushy.  BBQ pork bun was good. Taiwanese beef noodle broth flavor was a bit off - maybe not salty enough for us -!noodle and beef accompanied the soup were good."}
{"text":"Found this place while on a visit to the Apple Store to replace my deceased iPhone (boo!).  The restaurant has a contemporary and modern theme.  It was brightly lit and comfortable.  I really enjoyed the chicken fried rice, which had shredded chicken instead of chunks of chicken.  The Dan Dan Noodles came hot or cold, my choice was hot.  I asked it to be extra spicy and they hit the target right on.  Mmmm....delicious.  While I don't generally feel comfortable choosing from Dim Sum carts (I usually let my friends do the picking, and I do the eating), I was the one who chose from the cart.  Not a bad choice, which leads me to believe that I am either very lucky (doubtful, given my track record at the casino) or everything on the cart is good.  I kind of find it funny that they put the \"First\" Dim Sum carts at The Shops at Summerlin on their menu.  Uh...it's the only Dim Sum cart at the mall.  Not that it changes things, but they are also the tastiest Dim Sum carts at Summerlin.

The portions are decent, the food is good, the service is friendly and attentive without being obtrusive.  What more do you need?  I can tell you...a wheel barrow to take me out when I am in a food coma."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. 
Came in at around 1:30 so it was pretty busy. We started off with some juicy pork dumplings which were amazing, right when you took a bite, this great tasting soup bursts in your mouth along with the pork. We then got their most popular shrimp fried rice and combination fried rice, they were both awesome. Finally, we ordered The beef with sukiyaki, spicy shrimp dumpling, and shredded chicken with ginger sauce. It's very hard finding good Dim Sum close by, these guys nailed it, I do plan on coming back"}
{"text":"Limited dim sum. The employees seem scattered and I ordered a glass of wine and i got cheap barefoot single serve for 5.88. I can buy 6 of these at a convince store for that. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre dim sum, but what do you expect for Downtown Summerlin? Service was very good, but we were the only customers in the restaurant because they had just opened. 
Pork and shrimp dumplings were good. Avoid their duck; it tasted like they prepared and cooked it the night prior and microwaved it the next day."}
{"text":"Stopped for a bite to eat after shopping, on 12 /13/14, we immediately noticed a young girl standing outside, we wondered why when there was plenty of space inside for the podium. The poor thing was freezing it was 47 degrees out. We decided to sit at the noodle bar, which quickly seemed like a bad idea, where as it was very cold due to the open door. We asked the server if they could close the door, he said \" no we need it open for ventilation\". The food arrived just warm, the meat in the shumai was tough, and our food quickly got cold, again due to the open door. I think they need to come up with a better way to improve their ventilation, after all this is Nevada. I can't imagine eating there in the summer when it's 100 degrees, is the open door the air conditioning as well?"}
{"text":"I loved the service. There was always someone willing to get you whatever you wanted! The Thai Tea was really good, very refreshing on a hot day while walking through Downtown Summerlin. I got the Japanese Shrimp Tempura Udon Noodle Soup. It was really good I loved the broth in it. It wasn't a mind blowing meal but I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Walking around downtown summerlin and found this place, so me and my wife decided to try it. The dim sum was good and BBQ pork was one of the most tender Chinese BBQ pork I've ever had and the flavor was good. Service was great very attentive. Its a place we will come back to and worth trying out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first time here. Service was perfect. Our 3 dishes were delightful. Spicy chili shrimp wonton was fantastic, Hong Kong style pork & shrimp wonton noodle soup was tasty; and the Juicy Pork Dumplings were incredible."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I had walked by many times and was enticed my the look and name. After seeing 3 stars on yelp, I \"had to touch the hot stove after mom told me no\".  We left were so disappointed because of all the great restaurants we could have gone to. 

We place our drink order and we're soon greeted with the dim sum cart. I was hesitant at how fresh it was but settled on pork buns and shrimp. The shrimp was nothing special and while the pork had good flavor, I am pretty sure they weren't made from scratch. 

I wanted bbq pork and noodles so I ordered minced pork sauce noodles and asked bbq pork on top. I was having a very difficult time communicating with the staff. He said there was already bbq pork on it. So I said okay. My dish came out and it did not have bbq pork. It was super greasy and I did not like it. Someone came by and asked if everything was okay. I informed her I did not like my dish and nothing further happened. 

I also had some tempura shrimp. Again, I am fairly confident that they don't prepare it themselves. Go to any local sushi place for 10 times better product."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me about th is place to eat the best shrimp rice.
When I got there with my girls we got greeted at the door, very nice. We sat by the bar a young man very happy and cheerful great us, I made my order of the shrimp rice, some pork dumplings. I ask the cook his name with a smile he said his name was \"Giovanni\" I was impress of this guy ability to cook he made the best shrimp rice. When it came to the bill very affordable I had a great experience. ...AWSOME.."}
{"text":"Food:  went to try this place since we're in downtown summerlin anyways. This review is only for....

Taiwanese  beef noodle  soup: I've tasted better if I were to rate just this soup it'll give it a 2/5 stars. The beef was thinly slice and it was hard, chewy, and lots of tendon. It should be chunks of beef that softly falls apart in your mouth when you bite on it. The broth I'm not a big fan either. I've tasted authentic taiwanese beef noodle broth before and this  doesn't come close. The only thing I like is how they cooked their egg noodle. AL dente 

Roast duck soup: though  I'm not a very big fan of roast duck  I actually liked this better. The broth was very flavorful  and  the noodle is cooked to perfection. I didn't really eat the duck so can't say anything to that. 

Service: this restaurant  have a very poor rating with  their service but we didn't really have a problem. They refilled our water without us asking. They checked on us and our food pretty frequently. 

Drinks: a pot of hot jasmine tea cost  $4.99 w/o tax which I think is way overpriced. Our fault since we didn't really looked at their price prior to ordering. 

Overall: would I go back?  Probably  not. Would  I recommend it to other people? not to my asian friends  that know the difference between authentic Asian cusine versus Americanized."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we hit them on a very bad afternoon.  It was packed with servers and very few customers and the service was horrible.  We did enjoy watching the cook prepairring our dishes while talking on his cell phone. Even more fun was to watch our waiter and two other servers stand and talk while our food sat on the counter we finally had to ask them to bring us our lunch.   The Dim Sum was laughable.  Oh well, with so many other wonderful places to dine around the Summerlin area I'll draw a line through this place.  I don't recommend  Rice Republic."}
{"text":"We had awesome service from our waiter Allen. Food was great & music is cool. Manager Luv kept making sure everything was ok. My favorite was the juicy dumplings!!! Yummy in our tummy!!!"}
{"text":"My second time here and, again, it was GREAT!!!  From the time we walk in the door to the time my family left the establishment it's was fantastic.  Cannot say enough about the excellent service.  Luv and Heather are a great management team.  Hospitality is great from the hostess, to the wait staff and from the cooks.  Now add delicious food and you got a great establishment.   Thank you."}
{"text":"Minh added $10 on my credit card! I left cash for tip but I guess she thought she deserved more! You are ridiculous and I am not done here! I know what I spent and later check my bank statement to see $10 more added to the total! Minh you are terrible.karma is a bitch!"}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best from the three servers that helped us one was helpful the other two seemed like they wanted us to order and get out ASAP. When we asked a question about the dim some menu because it was not to clear on the menu it self all we got was a rushed response.

Server #2 came and was asking us what we wanted to eat in a rushed manner when we took (I swear to you guys no longer than ten seconds) he walked away is a disgruntled manner. 

Server #3 was awesome,polite and vary helpful with the menu question we had to bad she came after we placed the order. 

Food was mehh and overpriced in my opinion. 

 I can honestly say that I am not going back to this place. 

Wish I would have read the reviews prior to stopping at this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best in Asian fusion, with great and friendly service and a fantastic atmosphere, then you should keep looking. This place on the other hand will give you the very best in terrible service, food and dining experiences. It will all start at the door, where the hostees may, or may not be waiting to seat you. When we showed up on a semi-busy Sunday the hostess was just seating another table. Ten-minutes later, I kid you not, she was still nowhere to be found. Another server ended up seating us where we waited another ten-minutes for them to locate a highchair. Irony of it all is that the highchairs were in the staff only room located, wait for it, right next to our table. 

The servers will be of no help in explaining the menu. For my family this was fine, we lived in Asia for over 4 years so we understood the menu. But the table next to us was asking all kinds of basic questions that the server could not answer. I felt for them when they asked if the dish they were interested in was made with seasame oil and the server couldn't answer. Knock, knock. Who's there? Nut allergy...

The open air kitchen allowed us to see what looked like the two-managers doing all of the cooking that day. Not sure, but it was clear that somebody watches too much Rachel Ray. Hello garlic! BTW, Ramen isn't made with garlic. Just sayin'...

Every place has an off day, but this one was beyond epic. With a crowded Downtown Summerlin culinary offerings this place better step up their game. We don't call it Snob-erlin without a reason."}
{"text":"Here for my first time yesterday with the girlfriend. The dim sum was very good, they came over right away with the cart. We both had a noodle dish, and shared some veggie spring rolls. I have the Singapore noodles with veggies and added chicken, don't remember what she got. Mine was spicy and yummy, hers was a little salty but good. Service was good, nice and quiet. Will be back."}
{"text":"Overall the experience was dismal at best and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time.  

For starters the restaurant organization is extremely poor.  There is a hostess station at the front of the restaurant...and, no one is at it...and why is there a hostess stand for 20 tables or less in a little restaurant?  Then you better hope your order doesn't get lost in purgatory...or sent to another table for that matter.  We miraculously got our dumplings after a long wait (which were not delightful by any means).  I would prefer the frozen dumplings from Costco for 1/8 the price.  While scanning the kitchen in hopes of our Dandan being made, we couldn't help but notice the amazing lack of organization.  You wouldn't even think that Henry Ford have invented an assembly line looking at this cluster.  The workspace was extremely small and the workers were playing bumper cars fighting over orders.  Only one dude seemed to have his crap together as he tried to take orders, cook food, and deliver orders while the actual waiters were frantically flipping through their notes trying to decipher which orders hadn't been completed for their tables. We learned from the manager that a majority of the employees are still in training; technique only: don't let the B-team keep sinking if the A-team can catch you back up.  All around us others were having issues with lost/wrong orders and long delays.  Finally, we struggled to get our check asking four separate people.  At least we weren't like the couple behind us who received two checks. When the manager brought our check out she decided to have a conversation with us about our experience.  We gladly provided our input that the place needed to work on their organization.  This was quickly answered with a resounding AMEN we were preaching with the choir.  She continued on stating she is planning a \"team meeting\" tonight.  I hope that went well, because this team isn't going to make it very far. 

All-in-all the place has a lot of growing to do if they want to stay open."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The dim sum cart is awesome, shumai and shrimp dumpling were on point! I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu. My only complaint is that yes the prices are quite high, they need a happy hour or something."}
{"text":"The service was very good. Friendly and efficient and I did not feel rushed. The food was also good. I had Dim Sum and fried ramen noodles with vegetables.  Topped it off with some mochi ice cream.  Yum, yum! I would recommend this to anyone and we're coming back again."}
{"text":"If you like ramen noodles from the store then you will love this place. Super disappointed with the bland taste and price. Ordered the Japanese Tomkotsu pork.  Be then on top of it all, the Thai tea only comes in small with no refills for $6. 

For a real good ramen place, go to the one on Durango/Warm Springs, they make their own noodles and cost $2 less!"}
{"text":"Horrible and exceptionally rude customer service.  We came at 8:10pm and the restaurant is supposedly open until 9:00pm, but as soon as we walked in the door, the cook or head waiter started shooing us out the door yelling \"We're closed, go go go.\"  I asked about the hours, and the response that I got was basically they didn't care, and the kitchen was closed already, so get out.  Perhaps the restaurant should repost their hours on Yelp or on the door to say \"11am-7:55pm-ish\" to better serve anyone who may decide to take a chance and come within an hour of closing."}
{"text":"Great place! Out door seating was great for people watching as well, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice, Vietnamese  coffee a must try. Owner Paul and our server Alan were very friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is not fresh unless you're there at opening. Service is decent. Anything made to order tastes alright, expensive for the portions and location."}
{"text":"I was expecting to walk into Rice Republic and have a delicious meal, but the only good thing I have to say about this franchise is that the vegetable stir fry was flavorful.

The service was absolutely horrible. We ordered vegetable spring rolls, but they never came. Our entrées arrived before our appetizer, which was extremely odd. Our green tea was \"supposed to be free\", but the restaurant charged us $4.00 for it. Our waiter never came by to check on us and ask us how we enjoyed our food. They barely even acknowledged our existence (Note that we were the only ones there), and the food was overpriced.

Will definitely not come back to Rice Republic. Summerlin does not deserve a restaurant like that."}
{"text":"First time at Rice Republic was tonight. Soda was close to $3.00 and was all ice. We wanted to eat inside but they only had tables by the doors so we tried the patio. It was nice and there was a live singer with his guitar not too far from the restaurant which added to the evening. Saturday night, but I do not know if it happens always or only sometimes. Tempura was not what I expected and only 2 pieces, so that was over priced, too. Pork dish with ramen noodles was good but too many onions. Food is light which was nice, we left without feeling overly stuffed. Husband liked it, but I thought it was just okay. Might visit again, to try some other items."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! 

To start off with, we have been here once before and had a great experience. To the point that we came here only 2 days later to eat again and had the worst dining experience of my life. They are supposed to bring out a dim sum cart, they didn't do that. No one spoke any English so when we ordered our food, I guess they took it upon them self to give us whatever they wanted. They got 1 out of the 4 things we ordered correct. All they would say was \"we bring out more\" but nothing was what we ordered or nothing was ever brought out. The guy serving us was in the worst mood and seemed pissed off the entire time. Even when I asked for some soy sauce, they had no idea what I said and looked at me like I was crazy. We will not be returning. There wasn't even anything we could do because no one spoke English and they had no idea what we were talking about. It's a shame because we were really excited but they blew it big time."}
{"text":"Had the roast duck and it was delicious. Also had dim sum which was also great. Service was friendly and great. Gonna try the soup next time. I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch on a snowy (yes...snowy) Las Vegas Monday.  Hot soup on a cold day was the plan.  Wife ordered Chinese dumpling noodle soup which was served first and hot.  It had a very good flavor.  I ordered the Vietnamese beef noodle which I sent back to be heated.  If I do not have a fog on my lenses from the soup, it's not hot enough.  Soup returned plenty hot and had a good flavor.  Noodles and bean sprouts plentiful but lacking the other vegetables I am use to with Pho.  Serving size was smaller than Chinatown.  Price was higher."}
{"text":"Would not come back again, the Pork Ramen was terrible, we could not finish the bowl and it left us feeling queasy for the rest of the day. Mediocre service."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp fried rice. The display of the food was lovely. Tasted a little bland but added some salt and it tasted great. Friends ordered Japanese Ramen with Pork and she said it was mediocre. Probably won't come back again but it wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"I had a lovely lunch with my daughter yesterday. Their food was delicious! We shared the orange chicken and egg rolls. Even though these are both fried dishes- they were light and with a wonderful crunch to each. The batter only added to the chicken flavor not took away from. I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the very first time ..  I ordered the shrimp fried rice and my husband the shrimp ramen both dishes were tasty and  the service was excellent waiters were attentive. overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the garlic green beans, it's an off menu item and it's amazing!!!
The duck fried rice is well done as well!
Atmosphere is nice, and the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service, but terrible food. We ordered the shrimp noodles (literally tasteless broth, dinky shrimp from the supermarket and ramen noodles, seriously), fried rice (terrible, I could have made better) and some dimsum.. speaking as a dimsum lover, I can tell when something has been reheated from the freezer. It was mediocre. 

Now all this isn't bad if you're just looking for something quick to fill your stomach, but the prices are ridiculous. Each dimsum (3-4 small pieces) was like $6.88 or something stupid. Our crappy shrimp noodles were $12. Never ever going back again."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food! The cooking staff was so willing to help. Family friendly great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic food, don't come here. We had some dim sum and noodles. The chicken from the cart was rancid. Not sure how long it had been sitting. Gave my little boy a couple bites before noticing and thankfully he didn't get sick from it! Spicy beef noodles were not spicy and taste was bland. Definitely overpriced too."}
{"text":"Interesting... we had the dim sum and the wonton soup it was just ok. Nothing special... Sit at a window table if you have long legs. They have strange tables in the middle of the room you can't move your legs unless you sit sideways. Strange staff service I cant explain it. I don't think we will come back unless the reviews sky rocket aka Master Chef shows up. I approve this message JK KUHL. Saving you from bad food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm so glad I finally did. The food is very good, lots of authentic choices on the menu such as Hong Kong milk tea & Vietnamese coffee. Many noodle options and various meat dishes. 
I recommend starting off your meal with the dim sum cart and try the pork buns and siu mai, very tasty.
The service was very fast & friendly, I was impressed at the amount of staff they had. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in the other day with my family and I ordered chicken fried rice and wonton soup. My fried rice was very salty and the soup was ok. But customer service was great. Wasn't worth the price!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to see if this could be a decent dim sum place in Summerlin. They have indoor and outdoor seating options. The food was above average. They have one cart rolling around with a few dim sum options. We also ordered a few dishes from the main menu. Good size portions, enough to share family style. Disappointed that our potstickers came to the table cold in the middle. The chef should probably be more careful not to serve rare pork! That really ruined it for us, especially since it took so long to get that item to the table (they served it last at the end of meal). 

Also the place did not seem too set up for young kids. All breakable plates and glasses were given to my toddlers. Given the family setting of Downtown Summerlin, you would think they would cater to the clientele better."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure I got food poisoning from eating here. I went Wednesday night with a friend who has eaten here many other times and never had issues, but of course I'm the newby and have a bad experience.

First, we arrived and the place looked deserted, even the lights were not on inside. The store hours said they were open, so we tried the door after a short debate and low and behold they were indeed open. The staff was apparently just sitting in the dark... Not weird at all, right? 

We sat down and started to look at the menu, in the dark, and quiet restaurant. Finally they turned on a few lights and brought out the dim sum cart. I don't eat a lot of meat except fish so naturally I got some shrimp dumplings. They were pretty tasty so I asked for a second serving, that's where things went wrong I think. The second set of dim sum didn't seem fresh, the wrapping was somewhat dry and sticking to the little pot, but I'm not normally a fussy person and ate it anyways. I also ordered the lobster fried rice as an entree, which I had to put a lot of chili and soy sauce on since it didn't have a lot of flavor. Not sure which of the two things I ordered got me sick, but I wouldn't want to try again just to find out. Thank goodness a couple of other tables arrived or there would have been zero noise whatsoever.

The next morning I woke up with horrible stomach pains and nausea; they lasted for the entire day. Not even Pepto helped, and I felt weak and shakey. Overall, pricey, not that tasty, and zero atmosphere points. The next time my friend ask me to join her here, I will decline."}
{"text":"Ate here out on the patio after getting my nails done and I loved it! This was my 2nd time eating here. I got the shredded chicken noodle soup and had an iced Thai tea on the side. The last time I had the duck fried rice which was also delicious. The staff was also really friendly and accommodating (:"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and friendly service.  They are quick to serve-with a sidewalk cafe style.  Good dim sum and excellent noodles!"}
{"text":"Ewwwe.... The food is super nasty. I will never eat there again.   How can a place like that stay in business.  They are also overpriced."}
{"text":"Eh. Really wanted it to be good, but it wasn't. Best thing was the shrimp dumplings, but not special and they had \"Summerlin surcharge\" (4/approx $6). Scallion pancakes had no obvious scallions in them, but sauce had some flavor.  Duck noodle soup was several pieces of duck skin/fat on bones (no edible meat), flavorless broth with a huge clump of noodles.  Chicken breast with rice was dry, though looked nice. 
Kitchen was disorganized. Got dumplings from cart. Then one bowl of soup showed up. Then pancakes. Then second bowl of soup and finally chicken. 
Maybe just needs time but needs serious work in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today the food as always was amazing. However the service was horrible. As soon as we walked in the guy took us to our table and just left didnt say a word. There was only one other table when we were there and this guy seemed hurried he asked what we were drinking and started to leave in a hurry. He took our order and we asked if we could get the dimsum cart for an appetizer he just  said yeah yeah. The cart never came, the lady came out with the truck helped another table and went to the back. Our food came out super quick so that was nice. Finally i asked if i could have my pho to go and he asked \"all of it?\" I told him yes. When i got in the car and looked at my food half of it was missing.  The server was a tall lanky man and in the end got helped by the manager half the time."}
{"text":"Eh. Not my favorite Asian restaurant by any means. Don't let the pictures of the food fool you like it did us. The beef and broccoli looked nothing like the photos. Kinda felt like we were eating at an overpriced Panda Express. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for dinner but we were disappointed with the portion size especially with respect to the prices! The food was tasty, servers were really good about refilling our water but the service was inconsistent. When we first got there, they were super eager to take our order. Food came out super fast once we had a chance to decide what we wanted. When we discovered we needed to order more food, there was a miscommunication with the servers and kitchen and it took forever to get the additional dish- and it was difficult to flag someone down while we were waiting. I can understand that since they are located in downtown Summerlin they need to charge more, but don't charge twice the price and give me what would be half a portion in Chinatown. Highway robbery!"}
{"text":"Food: Could have been better, the reference for food comparison would be spring mountain china town Las Vegas  Dim sum. Taste wise the food at spring mountain is far superior than rice republic, expected the food to be so much better because of the price and the location of the restaurant. Hopefully it would improve its a very good location I would hate for the restaurant not succeed. For me food quality and price is the most important in any ratings at this point its a 1 star. I will try again depending if the ratings improve.

Restroom: The restrooms are located outside of the restaurant which is a 45 second to a minute walk. Makes the dining experience bad. A small restroom within the restaurant would have been good investment.

Ambiance: The dining environment is pretty good its hip and the decor has a retro modern look makes the restaurant appealing to try, again the only let down is the food!!!

Service: Service was good."}
{"text":"Great place, good atmosphere. Food is delicious and they have dimsun card going around!!! Stuff is very friendly and polite too:)"}
{"text":"Quick visit to Vegas to tend to family and found Downtown Summerlin. Hubby loves all things noodle so when we spotted Rice Republic we knew exactly what we were having for dinner. After checking the menu outside, we went in. The place was busy and we picked our favorite spot at the bar. The staff was quick and attentive and got our drink orders right away. After looking over the menu and asking a few questions, I ordered spicy Dandan noodles with shredded chicken breast. It came and was quite tasty. The noodles weren't as spicy as I hoped and the flavor of peanut butter took me by surprise, but the chicken was tended and combined together was an overall delicious meal. Would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The host and waiters didn't greet us, and didn't give a friendly tone at all. I had asked my waitress a question on whether we can sit outside, and all she did was laugh and get another waiter, never answering my question. The food was adequate where I ordered the duck fried rice, pork/shrimp wonton noodle soup (tasted bland), and the pan fried dumpling that were filled with water."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a perfect location.  I went here after the movies which was a small walk away.  It was quite and small.  We sat on the patio and it was very nice with lights around on the trees. The waitresses are very nice and helpful.  They answered all the questions we had.   We had noodles both ramen and udon.  They are both very tasty.  Next time I want to try their dim sum!"}
{"text":"First and last time here.  Over priced generic food. Soup broth and egg rolls were the best thing. The iced green tea looked and tastes like water. Beef fried rice very fatty and NO flavor. Sadly disappointed"}
{"text":"I waited to dine here due to some old reviews - maybe they would make it better and unfortunately it's true sad to say. Great ambience and service but overpriced and lackluster menu. My child ordered orange chicken - chef's special and it didn't have any hint of orange or tanginess. Served with onions, green beans and onions - not used to this way if it is even right? Dim sum cart was a joke and as many other reviews the shrimp dumpling -  the wrapper ripped and separated from the filling easily. I haven't experienced that much separation when I go to a real dim sum joint. And lastly overpriced noodle and soup which goes for way under $8 and better quality broth at a real Chinese restaurant. Lower the prices, fix the dim sum and you prolly have this place full, much needed good Chinese at down town Summerlin but this one misses the mark and continuous to do so."}
{"text":"Went on a lunch break and decided to try out some fried rice. I explained that I don't want white onion while he was small talking, we talked about it several times upon ordering. The person got distracted and totally forgot to leave out the onion. They remade it for me but I could tell they were talking about me on the side it was pretty obvious as they were laughing and joking around. Very unprofessional and made me feel uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Had the Hong Kong Style Won Ton noodle soup. 
The broth was well flavored, if slightly salty. The Won Tons were fresh tasting and nicely textured.
The noodles were well textured and they throw in some greens and cilantro (which isn't something I've had in my won ton soup before, but complimented quite well)

The service however was slow and disorganized and never once checked on me. I understand it wasn't a big cheque, but the place also wasn't busy and it would've been nice to have been checked on just once to make sure everything was OK."}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service. They stop serving customers coming in to get a table forty five minutes prior to close. They have zero manners. They also returned my tip at the end of the night because they weren't satisfied with the amount. Given how terrible their service was, they're lucky I even gave them one cent. Lastly, the food is mediocre at best and the portions don't make sense with the price. I will NEVER be coming back here again. It beats my how this place is still open at Downtown Summerlin. It's the black eye of the area."}
{"text":"Usually when I'm looking to eat an \"out of this world experience\" of asian food, I normally would try my hardest to find a hole in the wall spot where the majority of faces were asian (proving the authenticity of the food) patrons.  

However, I think I just found the exception to everything I've believe life to hold.  And it goes by the name of RICE REPUBLIC. 

This review is based on my first virginal experience at this restaurant (RR) and location.  

Immediately, when walking through the door I was greeted by a chef (who came to be later known as, Chris).  I always look for the warm welcoming because if a restaurant cannot greet within the first 5 seconds of an entrance, then the restaurant has become lazy (complacent).  I approached the bar since I'm a solo food critic for the day and instead of taking a two/four topper, I wanted to be polite for anyone who came after me.  

It was during the mid to end of the lunch rush, but for a the newest/hottest mall in town, I was pleasantly surprised for TUESDAY it was relatively busy.  

I wasn't immediately greeted after that by any one particular server, so I didn't mind reaching out to see whoever could help me since I was sitting at the open faced kitchen.  I caught the attention of a person I thought to be the server, but ended up being the GM, LUV.  

I asked for recommendations on hot teas (since for some strange reason it was 68 Degrees in Vegas), and he was skilled in the art of Le Tea (I made that up ... or did I?).  Suggested Green at first, but then asked if I appreciated an experience for fruitier notes.  I acknowledged that I was open to trying something new and he brought me their house Jasmine Tea, which pleasantly was warm to the belly. 

I was surprised for such a small sized location they were able to fit a traditional CHINESE DIM SUM CART!  Yup! You heard it right ... a DIM SUM CART!  I was immediately on board to try that as an appetizer (BUT they had me at their menu ... which looked a little grunge, which made it more authentic ... no need for a pretty menu ... its lunch).  

I ended up order the SHU MAI and HAR GOW to start.  Two of my fanboy DIM SUM favorites since youth.  Then I order two more servings of two different DIM SUMs.  I wasn't a fan of one because of texture, but the other one replicated HAR GOW except for a slight variation.  YOU WIN SOME. YOU DIM SUM.  

The staff was very attentive.  That includes the other servers who didn't even have my section and the HOSTEST (with the MOSTEST)!  She asked me on two different occasions if I was doing alright and if everything tasted good. KUDOS to her!  Extending more than her greeter and table seater skills (Mad Props!).  

I was later suggested by LUV, the manager, to try a couple of other items on the menu (i.e Taiwanese Chicken and Rice Plate) which I'll have to come back and try.  I was completely full off of the DIM SUM. Since I was full he politely suggested dessert and when I was on the border line of a yes/hell yes, he told me to trust his choosing powers and let him decide for me (...trust issues what?!).  The results were a magnanimous one of a kind lightly breaded CHINESE MANGO CHEESECAKE, drizzled with decadent chocolate, and a divided, yet whole strawberry mochi.  I'm thinking this was OFF the MENU, but who cares ... I literally inhaled it.  

LONG WINDED: overall the experience was obviously to be boasted about!  From start to finish everyone was friendly, customer service oriented and attentive.  The food was excellent and I can't wait to see where my next experience leads me with my new found relationship."}
{"text":"Don't let the three stars fool you, I wasn't hungry and met a friend here. she ordered the BBQ pork over rice. it looked so awesome I had to have a bite. I ended up eating half of the bowl. you gotta try it."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite in between  shopping or just before a movie. Relatively inexpensive about $14.00 for an appetizer and a main.  The restaurant reminded me of an Eastern/Asian diner but instead of burgers and fries there was dumplings and soup.  The food was fresh and tasty. Staff was very friendly the manager Heather stopped by our table to ask for our take on the service and food.  Over all would definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today to take a break from holiday shopping. I ordered the shrimp and scallop dim sum, as well as some pork buns. The food was okay... Though, I doubt I'd recommend this place to anyone. Also, the service left something to be desired, I could not get a server's attention for the life of me, and they were not busy by a long shot."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and good. The prices though are very high for the small amounts you get!"}
{"text":"We got there at 9:10 on a Saturday and they close at 10. They made sure to lock the doors by 9:15 so no one else could enter through the front.

The food was mediocre. I had a spicy noodle soup.

When we asked \"how the Dim Sum service worked,\" our waiter replied \"oh that stops at 9 but I guess I could go get the dim sum menu for you.\" (We decided not to get dim sum since this guy made us feel bad for even asking about it \"so close\" to closing time).

This might be weird, but personally I find that making your guests feel guilty about being there is not a GREAT service-tactic. 

I should've trusted the 3-star average rating they had before I got there.

Giving two stars is generous and it's only because 1 of the 3 people we interacted with was very nice while we were there."}
{"text":"This place is PERFECT! Good food, nice atmosphere, and their employee Rithy is the absolute best."}
{"text":"First time here today.  Got the house lobster noodle soup - delicious.  Huge pieces of lobster and lots of noodles.  Very filling and satisfying.  But the best is the pork steamed dumplings.  The best we've ever had.  Place was packed with a wait list.  We got bar seats - very convenient.  Very friendly staff.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great for vegans. We like the vegetarian ramen, the scallion pancakes and the newly added crushed nut fried rice. Not expensive. Nice people. Over worked. Cut them some slack."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I used to spend every summer in Taiwan so I know what Taiwanese food is supposed to be like, and this is Taiwanese food! My sesame noodles were the right texture and flavor, and the steam juicy buns were the best I've had in Vegas. The sauces they used were just like what my grandmother would make!!!! 

Don't confuse this with an American Chinese restaurant. Everything I saw come out of the kitchen seemed less oily and more refined than the restaurants in Chinatown. 

The interior is much more comfortable and clean than your typical Chinatown restaurant. The manager was very nice and very accommodating. 
The hostess was not the brightest crayon in the box but I understand how hard it is to find good help in Vegas so I won't count it against them especially since this is a casual restaurant. 

I can't wait to come back to try more things!"}
{"text":"I was there on Monday. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Kung pao shrimp was great. Wok cooked vegetables were fresh.  Good service."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. We were in the area and looking for a quick snack so we stopped in. Since we love noodles we thought we'd check it out. 

We ordered a couple dishes from their dim sum menu but the portions were really small and they charged about $6/ plate for dim sum. The fried rice and fried ramen noodle (special) were also just okay. Lacked flavor.  They had this beer in a Buddha glass that I had never seen before, which I wish I tried but oh well. Guess I'll have to find it somewhere else. 

Pros:
Decor was nice and clean. 
Staff were all friendly."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious I've never had something that wasn't good. My favorites are the juicy pork dumplings and the duck fried rice, both are like a magical food experience. I highly recommend the place. They also have mochii ice cream which is delicious."}
{"text":"This is like being in Taiwan - with the language barrier and everything. it's clean and neat, and the people running this joint are reminiscent of a dysfunctional family, but they get the job done. It reminded me of a local diner. I'm a noodle fan, so I ordered Ramen with chicken. It was pretty good, although slightly bland. Prices were a little high for the service and portion. Beer selection was paltry but interesting. Not too shabby, but not award-winning either."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but this one is warranted. The food we ordered, the dim sum, was not cooked fresh,was stale, and the paper was permanently glued on to the food hard to get off. 

The food overall doesn't taste good. We ordered dim sum, Taiwanese chicken noodle soup, shrimp tempura, many foods and all tasted badly. We really tried to find something good on the menu. We failed. They failed."}
{"text":"This was some of the worst food I have ever had. I am familiar with the theme but all of the food had hardly any taste. The meat I ordered was mostly fat and of poor quality. It honestly tasted like a Chinese TV dinner. The service was only alright. My partner and I both left hungry after paying for our $30 check. Do not waste your time here."}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good, but I'd imagine that many will experience sticker shock looking at the prices on their menu.

The decor is interesting and the service is friendly, so no problems in that department. 

So you'll probably enjoy your food, but I probably won't be back to have an $11 bowl of fried rice that I can get for about half that on Spring Mountain that tastes just as good."}
{"text":"Not good! Ordered the shrimp fried rice and was simply a sub par fried rice with some pre cooked frozen shrimp set on top.  Service was rushed and unfriendly"}
{"text":"Worst service I have EVER had, and I am not a picky person! 

Here is what our server did:

1) Brought dirty plates right as we sat down. Rolled his eyes when we asked for replacements.
2) Walked away while we were talking to him SEVERAL times
3) Our order was completely wrong, and it took him 35 minutes to come to our table to check on us (we kept trying to get his attention, but we were completely ignored)
4) After we told him it was incorrect, he argued with us about the overcharge he put on our bill!
5) We were so calm talking to him, just trying to reason with him, and he walked away as we were talking to him about our bill

Other staff members did not help us either, even when we asked because our order was completely wrong.

Oh yeah, and the food was terrible and over priced.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."}
{"text":"Wow. 
This place is amazing! Bf and I dined in the other day and what amazing food they have. 
We enjoyed it very much. 
So we had their amazing lobster fried rice, it was so good. Omg. The flavor was really good mixed in with the veggies and stuff. It was awesome. 
We also had their dim sum, which we did not expect since we're at Summerlin, taste just like the ones they have at Chinatown. 
Customer Service: beyond anything we asked for. 
Usually Asians at Chinatown kinda just throws the plate at you lol but here they're super nice and came to check up on us very often. All I can say is great customer service and amazing food. 
If you have any doubts, don't. Go there! 
You will not regret it! Great food and great ppl working there. I DEFINITELY Recommend trying! 
Excellent customer service~"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff! The food is amazing!

I really love the minced pork over rice and the serving is huge. Also, the choice of sitting outside is nice when the weather is amazing!"}
{"text":"Sigh... I really wanted to like this place. The menu looked super promising, it's close to my house, and it's not ridiculously expensive. I had high hopes.
Full disclosure: I am a huge fan of Din Tai Fung in LA, and that is the standard that I hold all other Dim Sum restaurants to. 
Juicy Pork Dumplings - the main reason I came. So disappointed. They were gummy, the soup inside did not taste right, and they were just altogether wrong. They were served with thinly sliced ginger (as they should be), so plus points for that. 
Shrimp and pork spicy wonton - these were good. Not as good as Din Tai Fung, but good. 
Pan seared pork and vegetable dumplings - these were okay. They had a nice sear on the bottom, and the filling had decent flavor. They were a bit bigger than I'm used to. The ginger dipping sauce was just ok. Altogether nothing special. 
Taiwanese beef noodle soup - I did not like this at all. It wasn't spicy as advertised, the noodles were soft almost mushy, and there were big hunks of fat floating in the soup.  The broth was a bit too salty as well. 
Service was good but not great. Although I was disappointed, it is a brand new restaurant, so I probably will come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was mehhhh... I had the Taiwanese pork chop noodle soup thinking it would be like my favorite pork belly ramen but unfortunately it was just noodles with a fast food \"pink meat\" type pork? Patty that I could have easily whipped up at home in the microwave.... It really wasn't bad just not that good either. Service below average as well."}
{"text":"food was fresh ,hot and served quickly.  a bit pricey but good overall
whats with the cameras all over the ceiling?"}
{"text":"Excellent noodle soup. They even cart appetizers. Great help, kind. Eating outside listening to Summerlin Mall's soft music playing all around. Very pleasant lunch. Price was very reasonable with large portions."}
{"text":"Quick review. Food was cooked fresh. I tried the Singapore noodle and it was very good. Good service. More expensive than Chinatown since it is Summerlin. The ramen itself in the tonkotsu ramen were cooked well, but the broth was not very flavorful, probably since it was cooked fresh and the pork didn't get to \"absorb\" into the broth. Should've gotten something Taiwanese...will try this place again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Dim Sum for the first time yesterday. A friend and I arrived around 11:30 and I had my son in a highchair so we were seated in a back corner. Not a problem since I figured the cart had to have room to get around. As soon as we were seated, a pushy waiter comes to take our drinks and walks away quickly. Then he comes back and says, \"You order?\" Because we had never had dim sum, we didn't know how it all worked. When we asked, he didn't help. We each ordered off the menu and then when the cart came around we just picked some stuff and figured it out on our own. A simple, \"Have you ever had dim sum? This is how it works.\" would have been wonderful. Anyway, the food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the pork fried rice but once our food was delivered we did not see a waiter again. No drink refills or nothing. After 45 minutes, (we eat slow), my friend went and tracked someone down to give us our check. It was over $40. Kind of pricey for subpar dumplings and crap service. Overall, the food was good but the service was bad enough that I won't be rushing back. Get it together Rice Republic because I want to like you!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! They've really tried to Americanize they're design and decor but there is NOTHING American about their food! After being to China and eating their authentic food, nothing has ever compared until we sat down at this place! It is absolutely amazing and so authentic! Including roast duck!!! Come here for a casual lunch or a fancy date night! Kid friendly and a beautiful outside seating area which we love in weather like this! We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We were seated and given menus. My friend was going to order a beer and the waitress told her that the ones with the black x's beside them were the ones they did not have. Well most of them had x's beside them 
We asked the waiter what type of noodle was in the dish and he told us something completely different. We thought we knew what is was. Anyway he was creepy. Hung around right next to our table. But not in a good way. Like he couldn't wait for us to leave. 

My niece ordered the dim sum. She said it was good but we had to keep asking for the cart to be brought back

That evening I had horrible stomach cramps and vomiting. Guess I should have read the reviews before we ate there. 

We are there because someone with use said they ate there when it first opened and it was good. She said that it wasn't the same. 

Won't go again."}
{"text":"Excellent Asian food. The Resteraunt is a little on the small side but never wait long.  The food is excellent. The place has a real Asian atmosphere, and I'm not talking about cheesy Asian decorations.  The staff has a real Asian hierarchy that you don't see in the states."}
{"text":"My daughter and son-in-law were excited to go here but I was disappointed with both the food and the service. I ordered chicken breast fried rice and the chicken was very tough and difficult to chew. My daughter ordered udon noodles and vegetables and she said they were good. But my son-in-law didn't receive his order of fried rice for another 10 minutes after we received ours. He said his was tasty. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a spot Summerlin needed as people who live in the area would have to travel to China Town to get a good bowl of soup. 

Immediately sat with drink orders taken, the menu is quite simple and easy to read. Available in English, Chinese and photos, there really is no easier way to order. 

This isn't your traditional Panda Express, so keep an open mind and experience authentic Asian cooking with fresh ingredients. 

The Lobster Noodle Soup came with great flavor and a great amount of lobster. Because Yelp has Yelpers who critic most anything, this place saves those type of Yelpers from writing salty reviews by basically seasoning the broth minimally and having condiments available for your salty, peppery and spicy needs. 

The dim sum was pretty good as the Pork Sui Mai almost melted in my mouth along side their version of chicken nuggets. The chicken was moist and I could basically eat that over McDonald's chicken nuggets.  

Nice and friendly staff with really good food. 

Happy eats!"}
{"text":"Food is so good and the staff is amazing! I've been looking for a place that has gyoza close to how they taste in Japan and I haven't found it until I ate here! This will definitely be my go to place when shopping at Summerlin mall!"}
{"text":"After shopping, I decided to stop by for a quick bite...Rice Republic is my new go to place for Chinese .... The dim sum cart going around was a great addition to the experience. The food was delicious but I was really impressed with the service. The staff was friendly and accommodating and then the manager even stopped by to see how my meal was .... I told him that Everything was simply wonderful. I'll be returning to Summerlin return here!!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and it was the worst I have ever had. It was like literal rubber. I sent it back. Terrible."}
{"text":"Food good but service was rude. Dim Sum only had 5 choices so not really a true Dim Sum option."}
{"text":"Minced pork noodles are fantastic! And they aren't joking about the spicy in the spicy  chili pork wonton..."}
{"text":"Great great food, but horrible service . 

I went today after a long hike at Res Rock Canyon with my 2 yr old and a friend. The atmosphere was pleasant. The hostess greeted us with a friendly face and quickly sat us. We asked for a booster seat or high hair and they didn't have but two in the entire Resteraunt which were being occupied. So my son had to eat in his stroller. 

They were prompt to take our order, but had no kid friendly items. When I asked for rice with just chicken for my son they were \"unable\" to do that.. Weird I know. 
So essentially I had to order a chicken bowl entree for him and pick out all the ginger, pickles, cabbage and peppers so he could eat . 

The appetite came after our meal and we didn't see a waiter again. We ran out of water and napkins.. No good when eating with kids. 

Finally after our bowls had been empty for 20 minutes the manager came out to greet us. He is a very nice man with great manners. We told him the food was excellent but his ratings online could be higher if customer service was better. He essentially said \"it's a family business\" and it is what it is. They are of Asian decent and customer service isn't there forte.\" 

Isn't that why they hired you??? Confusing I know! 

We paid and received more water finally and left. 
I would definitely come backs the food, when I'm in no rush with No child. But other than that, think twice when eating with kids."}
{"text":"First time here. Got dim sum, half roast duck, shredded chicken fried rice. The duck was super dry and cold tell it had been retried in a pan. Not worth even eating unless you want duck jerky. Fried rice was ok, but rice was undercooked. Shi mai was decent, chicken feet ok, pork dumplings a little greasy. Overall, over priced mediocre Chinese food. Better to just make the drive to china town, pay less and get better food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, dim sum was on point. Not too many choices but didn't mind at all.. Had all of the favorites available. I'm not sure what the other yelpers were talking about. I much I rather eat up here then drive to Chinatown. Will come back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Japanese udon, and it was delicious. Especially the shrimp. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Super cute set up and the staff was great!!! The food was horrible. I was so excited to eat here but very disappointed in the taste of the food. 1st I ordered the sesame noodles had them take that back. The shrimp fried rice and beef something. That wasn't any better at all"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant after shopping at the mall. It had a nice setting inside, clean and chic tables/chairs. Not like most Chinese restaurant we've seen. Beef Noodle Soup ($13) was O.K., but beef was \"dry\" & \"over-cooked\". Shrimp Fried Rice ($13), well presented, but had too much cabbage. It has a big room to improve."}
{"text":"First off service was horrible with the service. I have should have known going in it was empty during lunch hour. Below avergage food and service lol was the absolute worst. First and last time here"}
{"text":"We were eager to give this place a try, but were terribly disappointed.  Several people waited outside of what was a half-empty restaurant while staff looked to us blankly and lifelessly milled about.  

When we were finally seated, we were sitting partially under an umbrella before a server completely moved it, exposing us directly to the afternoon sun and glare.  We asked if he could move it back, but it appeared language might have been a barrier. After a few moments of him misinterpreting us, we were offered to move to another table, which we did.  As we looked around, people were seemingly leaving in a huff about something, and we noticed a dish arriving to a table just as patrons were getting up to leave.  This should have been a red flag prompting us to leave, but we still wanted to see how the food measured up.

We ordered steamed and pan-fried dumplings, one in which had undercooked pork.  Yes. Undercooked pork.  The noodles that came, Dandan and Sesame, were covered in what looked and tasted like a bland peanut butter paste. We are pretty open-minded with food, but this looked and tasted awful.  

We left the bowls as they were, and asked for the check, and left. The staff seemed overly preoccupied with everything other than their customers and the pride in the product was apparently on vacation.   

A major disappointment."}
{"text":"Food was ok and service could've been better.  We initially came in to try out the dimsum.  We looked at the menu and saw a few not realizing until after that we should've asked for the dimsum cart.  Anyway we tried a couple of choices of dumpling from the menu and it was ok.  I probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about diving into a bowl of noodle soup on a 100-degree day, but the kid wanted it. I blame this on her Italian Dad, who views pasta as a food group. Whatever, he also doesn't chastise me for my wine imbibing  and encourages the consumption of dessert with dinner, so, we're cool. 

The kid got the lobster pasta because she is practicing for when she's old enough to date. (order the lobster, most expensive thing on the menu). In this case, the lobster pasta set me back a cool $19 bucks. It was what you'd expect, a bowl of noodle soup with lobster thrown in. Good, but not the best thing I'd try that day. 

What I really liked was my noodle soup. Topped with BBQ pork and duck, this I feel is their specialty. While I also feel that the duck would be better served on a bed of rice or with vegetables, so that the skin could be left crispy, the soup was still good. The noodles in particular were so beautifully done, it made me wonder if they are homemade?

The single most enjoyable thing we had however was the scallion pancake. Crispy, buttery, not too 'oniony' and with a savory dipping sauce that took this simple appetizer over the edge to Flavor Town."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place NO stars. Ate here about a month ago and it to put it succinctly, the dim sum was AWFUL and the service was a complete joke. AVOID this place. It shocks me to read so many reviews here saying how good the food is at Rice Republic. Those poor people either have really low standards or have never had good authentic Chinese food. There are so many better dim sum and noodle house choices in Vegas than Rice Republic. 

Strike One: The hostess randomly decides to seat us at the table closest to the entrance where it was very cold due to the entrance door always opening and a cold draft constantly coming in. This is despite the fact that there were plenty of open tables further inside the restaurant where it was much warmer. We immediately ask for another table further inside and she then seated us as we wished before handing us the menus. 

Strike Two: After looking at the menus, about 10 minutes have gone by without anyone greeting us or taking our drink order. Another 5 minutes pass with no acknowledgement whatsoever. We finally see a woman pushing around the dim sum cart and she approaches our table. We order 2 servings of Har Gow, but have still yet to be approached by an actual server to take our drink order. Naturally we were starving by that point so we decided to start eating with the hope that a server would come to our table to serve us drinks or take our menu order. No such luck. 

Strike Three: The Har Gow that we ate was terrible. It was cold, bland tasting, and just poor quality overall (even by Vegas standards). It's safe to say that this was the worst Har Gow I've had. Ever. And that's saying a lot. 

At this point we still had not been approached by a server. We kept glancing at the other servers attending the other tables to grab their attention but to no avail. After having enough of this, I finally yell out \"Can we just have the check please?!?\" That apparently got some attention because a server came running over immediately, rang us up, and gave us our check. As she handed us the check, she then had the NERVE to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. I looked up at her and asked if she was kidding. I asked her why would we order our FIRST drinks of the night AFTER the check has been closed and paid for. Before she could reply, we got up from the table and walked out. This place has to rank among the worst in terms of dining experiences that I've had. Bad food and a joke for customer service. 

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Man, we should have already taken the bad omen just coming in to this place. No hostess in the front and when we came in, the hostess looked at us like what the hell do you want?  We got iced teas that had no ice and was fairly warm. I had to ask for ice on the side and the tea tastes like slightly colored water. So...... I'm in here right now waiting 30 min for a simple rice dish and when my food arrived, I was served cold roast duck which I just cancelled because at this point I just completely lost my appetite. How horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"My mother and I stopped in here while we were shopping, we've never been here nor did we know what we wanted upon seating. But 2 minutes in, we we're welcomed by their appetizer cart and friendly staff who suggested our noodle dishes to us, which were delicious, and came to our table so quick! They never rushed us or hassled us for more orders, they just let us talk and digest, even started a nice conversation with us too. This is a definitely great find and we'll be back!!! Thank you for your yummy food and service!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Rice republic in downtown Summerlin. There was my daughter, son-in-law and their two children. I ordered the Taiwanese style pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup. I was not impressed with the soup as it had a small handful of noodles,  4 to 5 small wonton's ( that look like they had been sitting around for a few days ) some sort of lettuce or cabbage cut up so small I couldn't tell what it was. Broth was kind of tasteless. The noodles were the best thing in it. My daughter ordered the Orange chicken with white rice. We asked if it would be enough for her to share with the kids. They said yes. When it came out it was on a tiny square plate with about 8 to 10 pieces and very few veggies. The rice order was so small I could fit it in my hand. She said the flavor was good but small size and not filling. The only thing that was fairly good and looked filling was the Ramen Noodles with chicken that my son-in-law ordered. Still the portion was small for the price. Total bill for three meals ( if that is what they were ) with only water was just at $42.00. Would not recommend this place as there are far better places for less money and more food. I may have to give them one more try as some of the other reviews appear ok but it may not be very soon."}
{"text":"Would've given negative stars if it were possible. Service was absolutely horrible! We were seated and not even given menus, took a while before someone came and took our drink order. We went to try the dim sum but there was about 2 items available.  After being told more stuff would be out shortly, nothing ever came out and we waited over half an hour. We decided to leave after having just shumai and shrimp har gow. We were there for just about an hour and that's all that was ever available, even after being told that more stuff was coming. Mind you, the whole time we were waiting for dim sum no one ever came to check up on us to see if we needed anything or wanted to order from the regular menu. Then the bill comes and they try to charge us $85 for 2 items.  After I dispute it they try to tell me that they inadvertently added the table next to us to our bill as well. Sure! In short, I'll never be back here again!"}
{"text":"I tried this place after a friend recommended it to me and I'm pretty impressed. The waiter that served us was incredibly attentive and well-mannered. The overall atmosphere and food was decent in accordance to its pricing. I'd recommend it to anyone who's in a mood for some delicious Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Omg. It was absolutely delicious when they first opened. I am finding this to be a trend in this area. All these places open in the food and the service is wonderful. 3 months later forget about it. Second time was okay third time was just awful. I can't keep paying all this money for food when it's just not worth it"}
{"text":"Not really a fan of this place... I came in here with my now fiancee on memorial day weekend and we were both kinda excited that there was a dim sum place in downtown summerlin.

I feel that their dim sum selection wasn't very impressive, and their prices were actually kinda high. So instead of the dim sum we decided to just order a the pork fried rice and pork dumplings.

Food: Was ok, wasn't really amazing and wasn't terrible. Just typical in my opinion

Service: Also ok, drinks were kept full and the waiters were attentive.

Ambiance: It was kind of busy that day considering it was Saturday, but one thing that was bothering me was the excessive amount of flies in the restaurant... I felt like I had to keep swatting flies away throughout the entire experience.

Overall I think this place is just ok...nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience as waiter did not explain what was on menu. Food was not tasty, the pork fried rice was fair. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Dim sum was good. Better fried rice at Panda Express. Orange chicken had a nice crunch. Ramen soup was ok. Overall food had no flavor and a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't return here again. We were greeted with an unhappy face from an older gentlemen while trying to figure out what time they close. The door says 9pm for all days but for Friday's and Saturdays there was no closing time stated so I asked and he told us they close at 10pm. He asked how many people in our group, we said 3 and a friendlier face came up to seat us out in the balcony/patio area. They took our drinks and we asked for wooden chopsticks instead of the plastic ones they left for us, the guy said okay but he never returned and someone else gave us our food. I had a wonton pork & shrimp noodle soup but the angel hair noodles that were served in my bowl were uncooked. I thought it was the style of the noodles but I realized later that it wasn't fully cooked and as I'm typing this review, my stomach actually hurts. My boyfriend and my friend both ordered Taiwanese Beef noodle soup and they both were unsatisfied with their orders. I wanted to complain to the server about my noodles but the entire time no one came to our table to ask how the food was or refill any water. None of us finished our food and when we tried to wave a server down for our checks, we were ignored. Finally someone passed by to bring an order to another table so we told him we wanted our checks please & he said okay. We asked for split checks and the man didn't respond or seem to acknowledge what we said but we did get our checks split and he gave it to us without saying a word. When we put our cards in the checkbook thing and the guy picked it up, again he didn't say a word to us. When we left, no one said goodnight, no one asked how our food was or anything. Basically, shitty food, shitty service. It was a waste of money. But I guess you have to try new places and new things to find out what you don't like."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a beautiful Sunday afternoon for a
late lunch so the lunch crowd was gone. The service was not good at all . The hostess took awhile to seat us even though it was slow and the waiter seemed rushed and short tempered. Waiter was not helpful with menu . The food was ok but I think it's high taken into consideration  of the service. I expected more since it's located in such a prestigious part of town (downtown Summerlin Mall)  .  The restaurant's decor is pretty and the food is not bad but overall the service was terrible so it made the experience unenjoyable . Don't try the dandan noddles !"}
{"text":"Fine for people who don't like authentic Asian food/restaurant experiences. The uniforms the staff have to wear are borderline racist. The patio was actually really nice, great people-watching and atmosphere, but the food did not make up for it. They have limited alcoholic options, and I've had way better food elsewhere. Five different staff members came and checked on us, which was nice, but service can't carry a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was very expensive and meat was cheap and spongy. Very salty and seats were so uncomfortable and I kept banging my knees on the table. Never again!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, the manager Lisa was extremely helpful and polite. The food was awesome I'm in love with the duck fried rice. Yummy!!! I will definitely be going back ;)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place half a star I would. Me and my girlfriend came here thinking \"why not try something new.\" Boy was that the worse decision of my life. We walked in and waited 10 min to be seated. We had to get the waiters attention to seat us when the place was EMPTY. We sit down and see that everything is above $10.00. Expecting that the entrees were enough for two people the waiter tells us \"no it's one person size.\" Did he mean that literally? I was thinking. Our plate of orange chicken comes out with 8 tiny pieces on it big enough to barely feed a child. The bill came out to $16. I would've  felt better burning that money than spending it there. We walked out and no goodbye, no thank you for coming, NOTHING. 

I will safely say that is my first and last time going to RICE REPUBLIC. Unless I have the urge to spend my money on food that I would feed to my dog. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim when I was out shopping for a coat.  I didn't find the coat I was looking for but I did find a restaurant I want to come back to.  It was a cold day just after lunch so they were a little full but I got a seat easily right at the bar.  They had a two sided menu with soups, noodles, and rice dishes and I decided to try the beef in sukiyaki sauce over rice.  

The waiter was quick to take my order and bring out a pot with hot water and tea bag.  It didn't take long for my meal to come up and both the waiter and the chef behind the counter asked if I was enjoying my meal.  I'm a little sad I missed they had a Dim Sum cart but it was going by the tables, not the bar so that may have been why I missed it.  

I didn't find the prices unreasonable for a sit down meal and the portions were good.  I plan to stop by there again and try out one of their soup dishes when I am next at Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but when I order rice I don't want more vegetables than rice. It was like eating the inside of an egg roll. Employee's barely speak english and were very hard to understand. It doesn't matter what type of food you have, in America someone should be able to speak english so you understand them at a business. When we tried to use the gift card that was bought at that restaurant and never been used and had the receipt with it we were told the manager wouldn't be in till Thursday and we couldn't use it.  A manager should be on site everyday!!!! Not a place I will return to, this being my first time there. Defiantly will never buy a gift card even for someone else."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my family. I had the Japanese ramen with pork and I had some steamed pork buns from the dim sum cart. I was not a huge fan of the broth and I had to mask the weird smell with chili, vinegar, and this delicious dipping sauce they give you with the pot stickers. I should have asked to get something else but I was so hungry I just ate the noodles and left the broth. 

The customer service was great! Everyone was very friendly. My son dropped his sippy cup and a very nice gentleman offered to wash it for me. At first I was taken aback because that NEVER happens at a restaurant but I happily accepted his offer. What I also liked is that he noticed I hadn't drank my broth and he offered to get me something else. Again, my fault, I should have mentioned that I wasn't too happy with my selection at the beginning. I was too full to get something else but I give him mad props for noticing.

They have wifi for their quests and comfortable seating. I will definitely go back and try another type of noodle."}
{"text":"Check your bill...2nd time there I ordered 3 items, my bill had 6 items....Food was really good...a little on pricey side..."}
{"text":"I dont know why people dont like this place. It has good food, good service and left us happy with our meal. Their fried rice doesnt leave you feeling all greasy like normal fried rice does. The dim sum cart is a cool gimmicky experience."}
{"text":"The hostess recommended the Taiwanese Beef Noodles. Best Beef Soup I have ever tasted! I was so impressed! The beef chunks were melt-in-your-mouth soft and the soup was full of flavor! I'm glad we wondered in. I will dine again the next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The taiwanese beef noodle soup is really good! We ordered the dimsum too but we ate it all so quickly and it was delicious too! We will definitely come back with my family."}
{"text":"Good place... service was good and the atmosphere is trendy.  Something new and different.    Good service makes it worthwhile"}
{"text":"The orange chicken lacked flavor and was soggy. The fried rice Taiwanese sausage was similarly tasteless. We found hair in the food. Furthermore, it was quite overpriced. They did give us a 15% discount for the food hair, so that was a plus."}
{"text":"Fabulous Service.   We dined with our 4 yr old boy who won't eat rice w/veggies.  They made him chicken fried rice w/out veggies or onion!  The chicken was shredded and piled on top.  We adults had the spicy beef noodle bowl and the duck noodle bowl.  YUM!  As north siders, I can finally say, I found a good Chinese restaurant.   I don't have to drive to crazy Spring Mountain.   Frankly I prefer this area anyway.  The HOT chilli oil is ACTUALLY spicy.  Our server was quite accommodating and pleasant.  Good quality, clean and friendly staff.  I like the chairs too."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Try that lobster fried rice! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I had wonderful service,  all the food was delicious,  the service was exceptional. Especially Ashton, she was so very helpful with the menu and what to order .THANK YOU ASHTON FOR THE GREAT SERVICE."}
{"text":"Juicy dumplings aren't juicy and obviously frozen prior, wasn't good. Sesame noodles are super bland. Dimsum items were so so, they're really small compared to what you get at authentic dimsum places. Nice decor and attentive staff. 

Definitely an over priced Asian place. Wouldn't ever go back."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Nice Ambience in great location. Price is high for food that isnt gpod. Im Asian so i know real asian food. The lobster fried rice which is $17 is prob the worst fried rice ive ever had. Corn in fried rice? How is that supposed to be asian? Female waitress was the nicest. The asian waiters are typical chinese jerks who give off the energy that they only care about money not caring if ur happy of not. I dont see this place making it! Terrible!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered food to go last night. His Hong Kong wonton noodle soup had only 3 wonton. The soup was made with fish sauce. I had Dandan noodles, what a disaster. The peanut was crushed to a point where I couldn't tell what it was, it was tastless. No scallion and no cilantro  and did not taste sesame oil. Completely bland.  The quantity was also laughable, smallest plastic container ever. 
I know chinese food, I grew up DanDan noodles. Because the food is so bad, I thought the food was extremely expensive for what we got.
I can't say they even deserve 1 star."}
{"text":"The manager Heather was very nice and resolved the incorrect charge issue that I reported earlier.  This place seems to be running smoother today also.  I had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup this time and it was delicious.  Heather suggested I get the hot peppers on the side and I'm glad I did since it was at my limit with only about a third added.  Thanks for the tip Heather!"}
{"text":"I had the Hong Kong dumpling soup and the flavor was amazing. The mixed vegetables and pork noodles were great too. I enjoyed the dim sum we sampled. I look forward to sampling other items on the menu. The staff seemed eager to serve."}
{"text":"The plan was Dave and Busters bunt since they were showing the fight they had a 3-4 hour wait. Kids choose Rice Republic. You know ur not getting authentic Chinese food when they use tea bags for their hot tea. Food was mediocre. Fairly expensive. Much more than what you'd pay in Chinatown or a ramen house. Service wasn't good. Waiter didn't have much patience. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night snack, and the manager prepared an amazing pork fried rice for me. The staff here was friendly, the food was great, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was over priced and service was mediocre. Serving size was a joke $17 for lobster fried rice and there was more vegetables than anything. Don't recommend coming here at all"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars!

Had a nice dinner experience. 

We had hot tea, pork fried rice, dan dan noodles, scallion pancakes, and spicy chili shrimp and pork wontons. The noodles were yummy. A creamy peanut sauce on chewy wheat noodles. They could have been hotter but were good. The scallions pancakes were ultra yummy with a scrumptious and zesty dipping sauce. The pork fried rice was good; lots of veggies. The wontons had good flavor but were cold and the filling was tough. They didn't have the tender texture you'd expect. 

We had great service. No complaints. We were visited by several owner/manager types and all our needs were addressed. 

Dinner for 2 1/2 was $37. Not bad at all. We even had a little bit of leftovers. I would definitely return. There was s big menu with lots of enticing choices. It's intimate inside. The patio will be lovely when it warms up. 

A fine choice for a good lunch or a casual dinner. Go try!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place but it was not what one would expect...

Got seated fast and the dumpling cart came quickly. We got our drink orders in and then placed our BBQ pork and white rice order...

We  ate all of our dumplings and we hadn't received our menu order yet... We had to ask several times for it... It seemed that the kitchen made it and it went to another table... We finally got it but it was disappointing. For almost $11, I was expecting the portion to be more than what we got especially for the wait... Not coming back. Will go to Crave and spend the money for good food and service!"}
{"text":"We wait 10 minutes to be seated in a half empty restaurant. Looks like they were shorthand. The dumplings came out raw. The noodles were horrible. We left everything on the table, pay and left."}
{"text":"After finishing my food and the great service i received I knew I would write this review and assumed that they would have a perfect rating and I was shocked when they didn't. I came in by myself and sat at the bar. I was immediately greeted and served water and even had some questions about the menu in which they were more then helpful about answering. I went with the tokantsu ramen and it was perfect. The guys doing the cooking, Shawn and Giovanni I believe are their names, went above and beyond making sure my food was alright and that I was well taken care of and that doesn't usually happen at Chinese spots in Vegas. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time there. Maybe they've made some changes after receiving the negative reviews below but this place was fantastic! The wait staff was incredibly attentive, we had 4 different people check on us multiple times throughout the meal. The food was ready in no time. Everything was delicious and even the chefs were super friendly! We will be returning! The only suggestion I would make is to have a bit larger portions for the price of the fish. This was however the best we've had. We left feeling satisfied and not bloated like we typically feel after eating this type of food."}
{"text":"The Lobster Fried Rice was delicious other than the fact that it didn't quite fill me up Considering I'm a heavy eater (eats 5-6 times a day) it doesn't surprise me, but for other people the servings should be fine. The server I got had quite a personality, very friendly and you can tell he loves his job. If I can recall it was Rithy? I'm not quite sure if I spelled his name right. But the service was better than other places I've been to."}
{"text":"Walking around Downtown Summerlin and went to this place on a whim. Very excited to try dim sum! 

The hubs and I ordered Shrimp fried rice, bbq pork, shumai, crispy scallion pancake, juicy pork dumplings, steamed pork bun and egg rolls. I know ....We like to eat. 

Everything food wise was Awesome! The crispy pancake was so yummy and the shumai.....so ono!

Portions are a little small for what they charge...I guess it is the experience you are paying for. 

Downside...service!
 When the dim sum cart came around we were so confused how to order and really was not explained. I pointed and she gave us our shumai.  We also ordered the egg rolls and steamed pork bun. She said it would be a minute she will start a fresh batch...okay! Still kinda confused on how it worked but hey....fake it till you make it....lol. We got our food family style and it was good. No refills on drinks, 20 minutes later steamed buns show up..still no egg rolls. We asked the dim sum cart about the egg rolls and she said sorry they will be right out. Another 10 mins we finsh up the bbq pork and pancakes and still no refills on drinks and no egg rolls....at this time we were full, thirsty and ready to go. We finally get the waiter to come over tell him we did not get egg rolls and we did not want to wait. Gave us the bill, paid and left.

Better service would have been 4 stars. Like I said food is great."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes, but sadly, nope, bu (mandarin for no, however I am missing the appropriate accent mark over the U). The decor is super cute kitschy, the staff was very friendly, but the dumplings were a bit soggy and unflavorful. The dim sum cart had a good variety and my daughter got pork dim sum, she said it was \"okay. \" The chicken fried rice was good, but had corn and a bit of bell pepper and felt a little Tex-Mex in flavor. The pot of jasmine tea was floral and tasty, so yeah, I guess thumbs up there. In general, it was just so-so.  
Bill $43-ish. Don't think I'd go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"I visited here last Thursday after wanting to try it for a long time because I love dim sum.  I had two servers with very different attitudes- the girl who kept coming by was super sweet and incredibly helpful and nice to my baby!  The guy who was coming by seemed to be mad he was there and was very quiet and he also came off as irritated that I had a baby who was laughing away at the menu and tearing up napkins.  Mind you as someone who was a server I not only clean up after myself and my baby I also tip extra because I know how hard of a job it is.  He was the first person to \"greet\" me so I was relieved when I saw that the girl kept coming by.  I tried the Vietnamese Iced coffee- huge disappointment.  I am half-Vietnamese and it just didn't taste right.  It was like the condensed milk or the coffee was sour- not bitter mind you but distinctly sour.  The steamed pork dumplings, duck fried rice and spring rolls were good but mind you I was starving at around two or three pm and everything is delicious when you are starving.  The food came quickly (the place was pretty empty so I was not surprised.)  I did wish the duck fried rice had less hunks of duck fat which is a personal preference.  The duck itself was pretty good.  Before I left I asked when the dim sum cart went around and the girl pointed to it just sitting near the bar and said it is always available.  It's nice it is always available but how fresh could dim sum off that cart be?  This isn't a health code violation?  I think it was weird and I was happy I didn't ask about it earlier, see it and be weirded out and then look silly when I would probably be disgusted and not order anything off of it and then be totally embarrassed to have made the server bring it over and take it back!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

My husband told me he ate here for lunch and had Taiwanese beef noodles! I was like What?!!!! That's one of my favorite dishes and I don't have to drive allllllllll the way down Spring Mountain for a bowl? So I made he get me to go a few days later. It was still warm by the time he got home and very hearty. Tons of beef and plenty of noodles although I wish there was a bit more noodles since I'm a carb girl rather than meat eating. 

It was definitely tasty. Was it worth the 16 dollars? Nope. I understand that being in Summerlin the prices get inflated but it's still Chinese food!!! Charging that much for a bowl of noodles is a bit obscene but I'm a sucker and I enjoyed it that much that I may be willing to go back if I was ever to lazy to fight the traffic down Spring Mountain. Overall, their menu is pricey but if you are ever too lazy to make that drive down I would come here."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place zero stars or negative stars.The sign above the restaurant says: Chinatown experience. Absolutely not. The worst Chinese food I have ever had. We had to wait 15 mins for a table when we could clearly see many open tables. The dim sum cart was cute and the actual offerings were typical BUT the har gow (my fave dim sum) was cold and gummy.  My mom ordered the Hong Kong style noodle soup with dumplings. It was basically boiled hot water with plain noodles and wontons. Zero flavor. Upon the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered steamed pork dumplings. Obviously, these are frozen dumplings, not made from scratch. The only redeeming things were the dipping sauce for the dumplings and the wonton in the soup. My mom added the dipping sauce to her soup just to make it edible. The service was horrible. I had to get the waiter's attention several times. The last straw was having to flag him down for our check and then, after waiting 10 mins, having to flag him down again to get the change. $6 for Vietnamese coffee! $6 for 4 pieces of har gow! The worst spent $32. Honestly, we would have been better off going to Chow King in Seafood City. DO NOT EAT HERE! GO TO CHINATOWN. (When I was asked from the hostess how our meal was, I told her that it was horrible and that I would not come back. She did take notes and was apologetic. I guess that was something.)"}
{"text":"While the location is amazing, especially the outdoor seating, the food and service was just okay. Most of the employee's are Asian/Chinese with thick accents making it hard to ask questions about the menu. 

There's a lady that comes by with a cart full of hot dumplings which was pretty cool and made for perfect appetizers. We tried the shrimp and pork dumplings, shumai, steamed pork buns and the egg rolls. All were actually delicious. I also ordered the shrimp fried rice which was kind of spicy and rather then have bits of shrimp throughout the rice, it came with several whole shrimp on top.

I will say, the Thai Tea was superb, made perfectly! Overall, this restaurant was mediocre, one I probably wouldn't go back to unless I just wanted the dumplings."}
{"text":"I've seen Rice Republic go from mediocre to absolutely great.

I came when they first opened in Downtown Summerlin, and it was not exactly my cup of tea. I've only come here a couple times since then, and the most recent was just last week. BUT it's DEFINITELY improved far from what I expected. 

I ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles and the Shrimp Fried Rice, and I can tell you it was definitely a bigger surprise than I was used to. The food quality has gotten better, the staff is VERY attentive, and I'm liking this place just a little bit more than I used to. I'm looking forward to coming here again to see what else is new!"}
{"text":"We ordered thoughtfully as we weren't expecting an authentic meal out here in Summerlin. I wanted to avoid meat so I ordered a vegetable noodle soup - bad move, the broth was a bit weak and the noodle was a vermicelli type, instead of an egg noodle or regular flat noodle which I was expecting;  the vegetables were an unexciting mix of cabbage and carrots. I got to try my father-in-law's duck noodle soup. That also could've been better as the duck wasn't that meaty or flavorful. Online other diners have some tasty looking dishes, so may be we ordered poorly. $42 for 3 of us for a light dinner."}
{"text":"Despite the mixed yelp reviews I decided to try this place anyway. It's definitely \"meh\". I got the lobster fried rice - which was bland, the over priced little dragon dumplings that were good - but not at 6 for $9.99, three dim sum plates - pork ribs were on par, shiumai - typical, shrimp kau - typical. Staff was nice, manager showed that he cared by checking on us twice, but water was never refilled and they screwed up our fried rice order. Mind you this was 11:00am on a Saturday. $53 with tip later, still hungry.

This place has potential but food and service need work. Take this from someone of Chinese descent."}
{"text":"We were done eating before we decide to check the yelp reviews. We normally check yelp first. I was surprised to see that there were some negative reviews. This restaurant was Great! 

I am Filipino and love Dim Sum. I went here with my husband, my daughter and her boyfriend. 
Our drink order was taken immediately. Then the girl with the dim sum cart came over.  We started off with several orders of dim sum. They were very authentic and very tasty.

For the main dishes we ordered a shrimp dish, a noodle bowl dish, and a meal with shredded chicken over rice. Everything was wonderful! 

The service was great and so was the food. It's a little  pricy but worth it. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The Taiwanese Beef Noodle is excellent!! Clean, fast, professional staff! Excellent value! Portion size is just right!"}
{"text":"We came when they first opened and it was the best fried rice I've ever had. So we decided to come back when we came into town and it had no flavor. Needless to say we won't be coming back owe and the dim sum felt rubbery like it's been sitting for a while."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, but not great.  If I could give 3 1/2 I would.   However the broth (or hot water) for the noodles has little or no flavor.  To be honest: tasted the same in Hong Kong.  However, they would benefit from using a chicken or vegetable broth.  The Wong tons were good and spicy but I think the wet noodle feel apart too easily.  Overall there is potential.  I would work on the soup broth and the Wong ton consistency."}
{"text":"While shopping I decided to try this place out it looks nice. Food was very yummy. I ordered the Singapore noodles and they were AMAZING. I also ordered the roast duck fried rice it was good. I also had the chicken egg rolls and they were also very tasty. This place is great. Customer service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Summerlin, the interior of the restaurant is very colorful! Not a large inside seating area, but they do offer outside and bar seating. They offer typical noodle, meat and rice dishes. What is great is that they have a Dim Sum cart! Something that is difficult to find in Vegas, especially served all day! The quality of the Dim Sum was descent, along with the shrimp tempura Japanese udon. Great lunch spot, however, the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"The only thing that was good was the patio seating other than that food had zero flavor and the service was lacking.  Didn't even ask how was everything.  Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time in a long time I was this upset after a meal. I realized that their reviews were not so good when I ate here but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. The location is nice, the decor cozy but the food will have you wishing you ate at Panda Express instead.  

I ordered the beef broccoli which was decent but not worth $14.88 and the pork fried rice was $11.88 . The fried rice was horrible I was only able to take a couple of bites .It was watery and had corn and carrots in it . The veggies in there looked like something out of the frozen food section. The meat had a weird after taste to it. They offered to wrap it up for me so I could take it to go I politely declined. 

I wanted to try Rice Republic because I thought it would be a step up from Panda Express or your local Chinese take out . I didn't mind paying more for authentic food but I came out of this disappointed and still hungry."}
{"text":"Great food! Always awesome service when I come here. The environment is clean and they make you feel very welcome. I love the overall atmosphere of Rice Republic :)"}
{"text":"Ordered:

-Taiwan Beef Noodle
-Onion Pancake
-Shredded Chicken Rice

I'm a big of Taiwanese Beef Noodle and whenever I am in Taipei, I make it a point to try as many different places as I can. What I thought was cool was that there is a picture of a beef noodle shop above the kitchen that dates back many years. It looks like the old part of Taipei where there are a row of beef noodle restaurants next to eachother. My all-time favorite is the now closed Ay-Chung. The broth is not too bad, but the use of raw Napa cabbage is a little unusual. It is probably the \"fusion\" part to appeat to Western tastes? The normal vegetable used (I forget name) is a cooked broad-leafed one. Another reviewer noted they had alot of tendon. My beef didn't have any tendon, but not as tender as I would have liked. Also missing is the preserved vegetable that is always included with this noodle.

Onion pancake was tasty but on the thin side.Also the use of butter is not in the Chinese recipe and again, is probably used to appeal to Western tastes.

The Shredded Chicken fried rice was very flavorful.

Didn't try the dum-sum since it didn't look too appealing and I doubt it would taste better than our favorite places in Vancouver, BC (we feel that Vancouver has some of the best dim-sum in Western North America). Vancouver is a place we frequent often.

We were happy with the service and the waiter was very courteous and spoke Chinese to us. Glad we didn't order the tea as one reviewer noted that it is $4.99 a pot which is ridiculous.

I would sum up this place as, \"150% more money for 75% of the portion size for a comparable Spring Mtn/Chinatown restaurant.\" We would definitely go back since it is just \"around the corner\" for those lazy days when we don't want to drive down to Spring Mtn. Glad to have this place in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today with my friend. We ordered the scallion pancake, veg spring rolls & tempura shrimp to start. The starters were ok, but not great. Everything was a little on the greasy side. The scallion pancake had delicious sauce. 

For lunch I had veggie stir fried ramen & my friend had lobster noodle soup. I don't eat a lot of oil & my ramen was so greasy it gave me a stomach ache. It also had eggs in it which was not on the menu. My friend enjoyed her soup. If I come back I will order the soup but stay away from anything fried.

We did not have dim sum but the cart did come around to our table.

Service was pretty good. Everyone was nice & attentive. I wouldn't come back just for this restaurant but if I'm in downtown summerlin & get hungry I'd probably stop by for a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Have you ever been the last to leave a party and gotten the feeling that the host wishes you would just go away? 
That was basically our whole entire experience at Rice Republic. My husband, two kids, and I went in for an early dinner on the patio one weeknight. It smelled great and we were hopeful. 
The service was terrible, the waiter audibly sighed every time we asked for something, and more often just ignored us. The other tables weren't faring much better, everyone looked equally frustrated, but there was one table getting lots of attention. We banded together with another table to try to figure out their secret to good service, to no luck. 
The food was subpar. I ordered soup, it was lukewarm and over salted. My youngest just wanted plain rice, but was hoping for soy sauce. Her optimism was cute, even while she when she headed in from the patio to try to get someone inside the restaurant to help her. No soy sauce for her.
I'm bummed. I was hoping for a new favorite."}
{"text":"My aunt brought me here for my birthday , there was a little bit of a wait but I don't mind. It was only 5 minutes. The food was between 4-5 stars. The 3 stars were for service. Our waitress was really cute and sweet but I think she just needs a little more training. She forgot our straws, she didn't know much about the menu, and we didn't see her that often.  She did comp our drinks which was really sweet of her, just a little
More practice and she'll be good. The food itself was extremely flavorful and hot when it came out! I'll go again."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I was very exited to have an Asian restaurant close to my house, but unfortunately the restaurant did not pull it off. They have a small dim sum cart available which made me very happy at first. However some of their items were very plain. We also ordered the Sukiyaki over rice and the chicken over rice and both dishes lacked flavor! I found myself looking for the hot and soy sauce. 
The restaurant has a very nice decor, its very inviting, but is pretty small. They currently do not have any alcohol and the service is mediocre. The food was not terribly bad, but I would probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The sign that showed store hours was blank for sat and sun so I walked in at 8:55 and asked what time they closed. I was seated right away and the waiter came back to let me know that they close at 9 but insisted i stay and eat. I know how annoying that is but i was seated and hungry so I decided to order. I have to say that the staff was extremely courteous and never once made me feel like I was being a douchebag for walking in at closing time. 

I got the Taiwanese spicy beef noodles. They fired it up in the open kitchen as I sat at the bar. When it was ready, the cook happily handed me my bowl and said to make sure to let him know if I needed anything else. I scarfed it down so as not to keep them waiting any longer. It was delicious. It wasn't quite the same as street noodles I've had in Taiwan but still close enough for an American chain. Plus, the staff was more than accommodating. 

All in all, the food was decent but the staff was great. I'll definitely be back, and at a reasonable hour next time."}
{"text":"First and only visit ....food was fair but overpriced and the service was non-existent."}
{"text":"Took my wife and uncle here last week for dinner. Friendly staff and good soup but that's about it. Management seems to be off. If your looking for the restroom , it is across the street (No Bathroom on property) Way too many scallions in my wife's fried rice and why does rice take 20 minutes? My uncles dumplings were half warm and half cold. Everyone checked on us multiple times except our own waiter and the manager. We told everyone who asked us how we were doing \"Fair\" we said. That pretty much sums up the experience \"Fair\" at best."}
{"text":"The idea is very interesting, the dim sum cart that goes around is especially perfect when you are really hungry.  Ordinarily,  you have to wait to order food and then they cook it and bring it to you, but the idea of a cart coming to you with already prepared food is brilliant.  That said, the execution here is slightly lacking.  The lady pushing the cart comes and tries to push all of the most expensive items and does not seem to understand you when you order something else.  She tries to hand you something different which is more expensive, very annoying.  The main food is quite excellent and rather different.  I had the minced pork on rice and it tasted pleasantly of cinnamon.  Also, the vinegar on the tables is a great addition to any food item.  The prices too are very reasonable for what you get, i.e., a lot of starch and while I was full  when I got up, I was hungry again within the hour.  In all I think the concept in great and the food is different but good.  I will probably be back and hopefully they will iron out some of the wrinkles."}
{"text":"Place was just ok. I had high hopes. Server was rude when I sent back rice noodles. Tasted bland and burnt. I would have given the place 1 star if it wasnt for the sweet pork bun and the one lady that wished me a good day on the way out. I wont ever go back unfortunately with so much other great food and service in that area. Bottom line was it was a dissapointment. A bit overpriced and the noodle dish was bland and burnt."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! The server was rude from the moment we walked in. First of all, let me just start by saying we wanted to try this place because it looked nice, and inviting. Yes, the place is nice, but once we walked in the server was grumpy and didn't even greet us. He sat us down and asked what we wanted to drink. (Mind you everytime he talked to us he was grumpy). Anyways we ordered dim sum it was okay. My fiancé ordered the teriyaki chicken and we also ordered shrimp fried rice, WHICH btw was a small ass plate for $12! Pretty pricey for the quality of the food. I've had wayyyy better for the same price and larger portion. No exaggeration when I say SMALL portion. It wasn't even that great. Anyway come time to pay our bill, it was SOOO EXPENSIVE! And it was a HAND WRITTEN BILL. I checked it over and they added an extra dish to our bill that we didn't even order!!!!!!!!!! I told the server and he checked it over, then he went to the back and they started talking shit about us in their language. They kept staring back at us and giving us dirty looks like it was OUR fault or something. Uhm, excuse me,  first of all its YOUR job to keep track of what the customer orders!! Anyways he came back with the fixed bill and this time the bill was an actual bill from the cash register! Uh hello? Why couldn't you give us a proper bill like that in the first place? I don't understand why they had to handwrite a bill (ALL MESSY) in the first place. (Like they didn't want us to read what the bill said and charge is for something we didn't pay for). It really felt like that. Otherwise why would they keep talking smack about us and keep giving us dirty looks for something that wasn't even our fault. It was such a horrible experience! We're definitely NOT going back there. EVER. I give them one star because the place is nice. And that's all thats great about it.  I've never written a review on yelp before but after eating at this place and paying $55 for not so great food, it just upset me so much. I hope no one ever experiences this. It was horrible!"}
{"text":"So if reviews were based solely on food, this place would get zero. We ordered steamed pork dumplings, steamed BBQ pork buns, sticky rice, and sesame noodles with chicken. The dumplings were soggy and had zero flavor; I literally tasted nothing more than the water absorbed during the steaming process. The accompanying dipping sauce was so salty, however, that the excess water was a necessity. The pork buns were dry and had the texture of Wonder bread. The sticky buns were false advertising; once we started digging in, a foreign object fell from the center. We were told the dish was simply sticky rice...not sticky rice with shredded pork and sausage in the center. Not a pleasant surprise for us. Oh, the sesame noodles...have you ever tasted mud? That was my first impression after a small bite. Inedible, at best. We spent approximately $35 on food.

Where do the stars come in? The hostess and waiter were friendly, albeit with a major language barrier. Their beer list left something to be desired, but we got Tiger Lagers, which were the only things worth paying for."}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've ever had. Ever super flavorful Homemade soy sauce. Gave it four stars because the servers idk if he was a cook, manager whatever but it was rushed. We my friend asked what an item was he didn't care to explain. Maybe language barrier? Idk but rice was bomb smaller portion for the price but I had leftovers!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim without yelping it first, that was my first mistake!  They have young girls outside handing out menus trying to get you to come in... and we did.  It all sounded yummy but did not taste yummy.  First we ordered dim sum and we were told is was bean curd.  When we got it and bit into it we realized it was shrimp, so they weren't able to tell you what it was... Yikes?  It tasted watery.  Then I asked what was the difference between Thai Iced Tea and Vietnamese Coffee and was told they had no idea and no one could tell me what the ingredients were in the coffee drink?  Then we order a shredded chicken with noodles with NO scallions and some other noodle dish with NO mushrooms.  They brought the dishes with all the ingredients we asked them to leave out and every 5 minutes or so we had a different waitperson, all of which knew nothing about what we ordered nor did they care.  All of the dished tasted liked they were watery?  I would definitely never bother to eat here again and would never recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"First time here and....well service is great and friendly the decor was also good looking.  Now my review...the soup I had was roast duck and roast pork.  It was above good near great except I really really...really did not like the roast duck just chopped with bone in and thrown into the soup...the taste was great but can not pass the bone situation.  My wife had shrimp Kung pao and that was great...gunna have come back to try the beef soup"}
{"text":"This was a most amazing experience. The manager Luv prepared some very special dishes just for our table. The food was excellent and only exceeded by the service. We will be back often...especially when we want to impress our friends."}
{"text":"How can anyone not like this place it has best soup and fried rice ever, its priced decent the only thing i dont like is they dont have restroom for customer's and you have to go across to use the restroom ... food wise i cannot think of anything that would not be considered and delicious...its  very affordable meal for 2 without appetizers just main course and soda would cost about $35 which isn't bad at all"}
{"text":"Nice place. Food not so good. To salty. Service is like all Chinese restaurant, rude and bad service. It's just me, I'm a server for more then 20 years. Maybe I'm not qualified to critic other servers. Slamming the plates and drinks on the table is probably the right way. Taking out dirty plates while the sauce is dripping on the table is the proper way to clean. Man I was taught the wrong way. I'll try this technique some day."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for dinner with a friend. The hostesses were extremely disorganized, the wait staff was not friendly, the food was underwhelming and the drinks are expensive. I was excited to try this place, but it really disappointed me. I hope that by the next time I'm in Vegas they will have their act together."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Downtown Summerlin, it was lot of fun and 
I got a chance to shop around and visit new food places.

One of the places I stopped by was Rice Republic, after reading the mixed reviews I wasn't quite sure what to expect however I was in the mood for Asian food so I gave it try.

I ordered the minced pork with rice, it was full of delicious yum-yum!! 
It was a good balance of savory, smokey sweet flavor.
I also tried the Dan-Dan Noodles with shredded chicken. This is like a perfect type chicken soup to eat when your ill. It was tasty and was great comfort food. 

My only downfall was that I wish I hadn't eaten lots of the noodle, because it got me full and I wasn't able to finish the delicious broth. I felt the prices were expected considering the location. For my appetite, I felt the portions were big, so I actually ended up taking home some leftovers.

I felt the staff was kind and attentive.
I sat at the bar so I mostly kept to myself, but 
I was able to talk to the manager briefly and ask about the dishes I ate. He was nice enough to explain what goes into making the dish which was cool.
As I was walking out, Maria the hostess asked me if I enjoyed the food and i explained my reaction. 
Initially, when I walked in I told her this was my first time eating here so I believe that's why she asked me. She was happy that i liked the food and we had some small talk. 
I could tell she was friendly person.

All in all I had a fine experience, whenever I make the trip back I'll be sure to stop by again."}
{"text":"Overpriced and Underwhelmed. $5.88 for Thai Tea is ridiculous and it was poorly made at that. Everything we had from pork & vegetable dumplings to the \"spicy\" Kung Pao Beef was bland. Appetizers arrived after the meal did. Server was friendly. I wanted to like the place and was really disappointed the food was so lackluster."}
{"text":"It was delicious! A little overpriced for the fried rice, but the shrimp/pork wonton soup made up for it.

Note: It can get crowded (make a reservation.)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my daughter after her doctor's appointment. We ordered shrimp dumplings, Xiao Lun Bao (soup dumplings), Chinese beef meatballs, pan fried dumplings, and Taiwanese chicken fried rice. Shrimp dumplings and Chinese beef balls looked and tasted old. The skin on shrimp dumplings were kind of hard from sitting in the push cart too long, the beef ball just tasted old. I didn't care for the xlb but my daughter said it was okay. The fried rice was pretty tasteless and we both had to add salt to it. The pan fried dumplings I thought was pretty good with homemade dumpling skin and pork inside. It would have been perfect if they were pan fried a little longer to get a better crust. 
The hostess was friendly and service was good. A bit over priced, could have had same and better in Chinatown for half the cost probably. A nice place for lunch but wish the food could be better to make the experience worthwhile."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Service was disorganized.  Food going to the wrong tables. the dumplings from the dim sum cart were indeed gummy like a previous reviewer stated.  My wife also thought the soup was not right.  The only thing I really liked was the Oolong tea.  I wont be back, sorry."}
{"text":"Can't say the food impressed me much. I had the sliced beef with sukiyake sauce over rice. It wasn't anything to write your friends about."}
{"text":"Short Review
Food: OK
Service: Bad
Atmosphere: OK (kinda sterile though)
Price: Higher (There are much better, cheaper places in town, but for Downtown Summerlin it's not overpriced)

Longer Version
We went to this places more or less on a whim. I've walked past a few times, but never got in. When we sat down staff was friendly and decently attentive. However, ordering turned out to be more difficult. They took forever to bring some of the food. When we first sat down we ordered a ramen, after waiting for about an hour and telling them twice it still didn't come. We asked one more time and our server forgot that we ordered it (even though we told them twice). Left it off and got the check. Their prices are rather high, though that's too be expected from a restaurant in Downtown Summerlin.

Conclusion
Despite their food being good (nothing extraordinary though) I won't go there again. Service was bad to the point where they forgot what we ordered after telling them multiple times. Which, to me, is as important as the food served."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup. It had a soapy after taste, the beef did not taste like beef, and non of the ingredients seemed fresh at all. Daughter ordered veggie fried rice and all her veggies were under cooked. The GF ordered like a veggie chow mein that had no flavor. Waiter didn't have any sort of customer service in him, sorta rude. Never coming back to this place. I would never recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is not good....the dim sum was very limited and the food was salty, oily, and lacked flavor.  And it was expensive!!!  Definitely will not be returning here....."}
{"text":"I will never go back here. I ordered an $18 fried rice and it was bland.  Please take note 18% gratuity on party of 6 or more. Kabuki is far more better and prices are reasonable. We wanted to try something new but it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM DIM SUM! Great food with a very authentic Dim Sum serving style and taste. I love the Dim Sum cart and the wide selection of delicious food inside! The outside patio seating is great with all of the Downtown Summerlin foot traffic and atmosphere.I have this love for Chinese Tea and the Oolong Tea is very refreshing, especially when there's a slight breeze outside. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have given this place a solid 5 visits since they opened. The first week early 2015, this place rocked with the quality-to-price experience. The second visit, I had food poisoning from a shrimp dumpling that was not pulled from the bottom of the dim-sum cart but rather, from the top. Bad move if you know anything about restaurant service and dim-sum in particular. The rotation of the cylindrical steamer trays is bottom to top to ensure heat and any nothing is left cool too long.
Third and subsequent visits were okay, bordering on mediocre. After almost one year,  I came back to visit. I ordered two staple dim-sum dishes...lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice with chicken, pork bao and a green tea. The lotus sticky rice had ONE piece of chicken and two other unknown vegetable ingredients. When this place first opened it had HALF of it filled with chicken. The bao bun, same thing; the rice dough was 1-1/2 inch thick around barely a teaspoon of pork when it used to be a rounded tablespoon of filling. 
Here is the insult to injury. Green tea (ONE tea bag) and a pot of hot water is $3.88!! I get the .88, it's cute, even practical for superstitious Chinese restaurants that want good luck but, $2.88 is already a 1200% margin!!!
I'm done here. I have certainly given this place more than enough chances at redemption."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really , but nonetheless I had a pleasant dining experience. The staff are very friendly and attentive until it comes time to pay your check. The food wasn't bad but really overpriced. The decor is gorgeous and the outdoor patio is a perfect evening setting. We ordered a few items off the dim sum cart and added egg rolls and shrimp tempura along with a bbq pork Singapore noodles. The shrimp dumplings were standard fare, nothing special. The 2 pieces of shrimp tempura ($6.95) were coated in panko not tempura batter. The chicken egg rolls were crisp yet filled with vermicelli noodles so the kids didn't like them. The Singapore noodles were quite tasty although the bbq pork was thin and tough like sliced jerky. The soda was $2.98 which is expected in this high priced restaurant. If you're in downtown summerlin there are many other better options for dining. Otherwise just drive to Chinatown for half the price and double the flavor."}
{"text":"Walking into the place we realize that there was no one in there so we thought we  might want to give them business... We walked in with our service dog and we presented our service badge they spoke in Chinese for a while and were very rude to us and told us we would have to sit outside... We inform them that this was absolutely wrong and anyone with service badge is allowed to dine with their dog as long as it is on the floor and obeying rules this restaurant is horrible and we will never return there ...three thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Decent food but poor ventilation. Located right next to Lush Cosmetics so the whole place smells like bathroom cleaner."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service with mediocre food. Was told it would be 10 min wait for a table for five; 10 min turned into 25 min. After we were seated it was another 10 min before we were given menus and our drink order being taken. After deciding to order only dim sum, we revived our first round, we asked for the steamed pork buns specifically, we were told it would be a few min as they are being steamed. After another 20 min wait with no food and no customer service, we asked for our bill to leave as we lost our appetites after waiting so long. We mentioned the lousy service to the manager, only to receive a half-hearted apology and wished a happy new year. We received our bill which reflected $84 for items we didn't order. After excuses and no apologies, we received our correct bill, paid and left quickly, never to return. Strongly discourage unless you want lousy service with ok food."}
{"text":"I really don't like giving bad reviews but words cannot explain how I'm feeling at the moment... Let's just say the food did not sit well in my stomach... The place was nice, service was good but the food... Dim sum cart came around and I got excited when I saw that they had juicy pork dumplings because they are by far one of my favorite foods! Got an order of it along with shumai and steamed pork buns and my friend also got an order of vegetable fried rice.. Umm, please tell me why the juicy pork dumplings weren't even juicy at all! It was dry as hell and and very hard to enjoy. Shumai was ok and so were the steamed pork buns... My friend didn't enjoy the fried rice. It looked kinda oily to me. I've never seen corn in fried rice before. My friend and I literally ate and paid for our meal within 10 minutes. It was by far an unexplainable experience. Don't know if I'll ever go back. Props to the all the people who actually enjoy Rice Republic.. I surely didn't!"}
{"text":"Let me just say, the food here taste awful.  The Taiwanese Beef noodle isn't authentic at all.  No one from Taiwan would put Napa cabbage and cilantro in this soup at all.  The soup was blend without any flavor.  The beef is tough which means it's hasn't cook long enough.  Very disappointed.  Wish they would taken down those photos from their wall because this place don't deserve it.    They are not even from Taiwan."}
{"text":"First of all service is horrible. I don't think they know the definition of customer service . I don't know the guys name but I asked him if I can have beef with broccoli and what did it come with he said rice so I asked for noodles instead . What does he do ? Yell at me to make up my mind rice or noodles ? Rice or noodles ? 
I should've walked out but I was starving. He charged me $5 extra to REPLACE the rice . Not to ADD to REPLACE .
I payed $21 for beef and broccoli with noodles. 
When I told all my co workers they have all experienced same bad service . No one warned me. Never will I spend my money there again."}
{"text":"First time here dim sum is limited in items and the price ranges from 3.88 to 6.88. Got the shumai nothing special 4 pieces 4.88 and also got the spicy shrimp and pork dumplings that was 6.88 im pretty sure there was no shrimp.  For noodles we got the sesame noodles with shredded chicken 10.88 wife got the taiwanese beef noodle 10.88 and we also got the shrimp fried rice 10.88. The beef noodle was good but to salty, sesame noodles had a peanut sauce but it was quite plain.  The shrimp fried rice is plain.  Love the decor but for the food if your looking for good dim sum or chinese food you will do better somewhere else wont be coming back"}
{"text":"Gr8 Chinese food in an outstanding setting in downtown Summerlin.   Delicious dim sum, soups w/killer broths and outstanding fried rice.  Service is excellent.  I did not like the barbeque pork which was uninspired and over-priced but enjoyed everything else.  Gr8 iced and hot tea.  Ambience was like you've been transported to Hong Kong."}
{"text":"We just walked out. The service was too horrible to even try. It took all of the fun of trying a new place away. Our questions about the menu were met with curt, condescending replies. We put $$ on the table for the hot tea we ordered and didn't touch and left. Sad. There is such promise there."}
{"text":"I have mix feelings about this place. Three of us had lunch there. Between the three of us half of the food we order was not good and the other half was fair-good. I would think if your in such a great location in the Downtown Summerlin Mall everything coming out of the kitchen should be excellent! The staff was friendly and the service was fast but, the they could learn some tips from Spring Mountain Road restaurants. I think there is potential for improvement."}
{"text":"This is the worst dim sum place I have eaten.  The soup is not even hot to begin with. Food and service was lousy. The only waiter working was in a hurry to get our order and didn't explain well the menu to us. I would not recommend this place or even go back there to eat."}
{"text":"I'll give them 3.5 stars because I thought the food was pretty good, although priced a bit high but this is expected for Downtown Summerlin. Rents must be high here because its new but everyplace here has high prices compared with other places. 

It was mid-afternoon so it wasn't busy at all, maybe 3 other tables. We were greeted warmly and seated quickly. I read a few bad reviews about service but we didn't see it, very friendly. Normally I always get pretty good service because I'm nice to the people working there, smiling and greeting them after they greet me. 

I had the BBQ pork over rice and it was really good. They had some shredded pork mixed in with very tender larger pieces of BBQ pork. Very good for me.4/5 My friend had pork udon noodle soup, and the broth here was lacking flavor that you get at a place like Monta. 3/5

We sampled a few items off the dim sum cart as well and they were pretty good, but nothing spectacular or different. 3.5/5

Overall, it was ok but there are so many places in town with better offerings. I don't think I'd come back just to eat here, but if this was what I craved when in DT Summerlin, then a maybe."}
{"text":"Received absolutely horrible service today. We walked in (party of 2) and it was empty with the exception of a large group in the middle of the restaurant. We were initially given a small table near a loud/larger party and asked if we could sit further away at a table where we could sit next to each other. The guy walked us over to another small table for two, and I explained again that we wanted a 4-seater table so we could sit next to each other. Didn't think it was a big deal, since the place was pretty much empty. He grabbed the menus and threw them down hard in the middle of a large table and walked away. 

Uhm, what? RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!!
We both decided we should probably leave, but were craving dim sum and were starving. So despite our first reaction, we stayed. BIG MISTAKE. 

The service continued to be rude, the tall guy stood in the corner and watched us like a hawk...and the \"dim sum\" cart was very bad. There were only four choices to choose from in one cart. None were really recognizable and looked like they'd been there a while (not fresh). We wound up ordering a couple things off the regular menu, and were ok, but overall not happy so we asked for the check and left, still hungry and off to eat somewhere else in the shopping center. 

I do not recommend dining at Rice Republic at all. Food was horrible and the service much, much worse. Plenty of other restaurants close by that treat patrons respectfully and actually pride themselves on service. That's important, and they just don't understand that here. Sad."}
{"text":"1st the good - the juicy pork dumpling. My kids loved em. The Chinese Chicken Salad was really good too.
Now the bad - the Beef with broccoli.  Absolutely no flavor and not enough broccoli. 
My wife ordered the vegetable soup and they forgot to bring it. Very Strange."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy!! We had the lobster fried rice and Taiwanese beef soup. Both were so fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"First time here and I absolutely love it. I'll probably come back next week if you think about it. At first the smell was repugnant but then it started to settle down. The duck I ordered was nice and crispy. The noodles were perfect and everything about this place is just perfect. Overall, the taste satisfied my tastebuds and I will for sure be visiting this place within the near future."}
{"text":"i had a wonderful food experience today. taiwanese shredded chicken was excellent.   fresh, hot with great flavor.  shrimp dumplings with chili and other spices was equally delicious.   Impressed by cleanliness,  attentive  staff in addition to great food.  Luv, the GM, was quite interesting to discuss the restaurant and the food.  you can tell he loves his job and is passionate about what he does.  Lisa, the assistant mgr. was also a delight to talk with about my dining experience; very enthusiastic.   I will be back soon to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"1 star for extremely poor customer service...not food since I never even got seated!  My story...went in today about 10 mins ago a little before 4pm on a Saturday.   Restaurant nearly empty yet host would not seat me at one of the many open tables because I am a party of one.   Insisted I sit at bar because no small tables open ( yet restaurant pretty empty expect for the few occupied 2 tops and a party of 2 sitting at a 4 top!  
I am in my fifties and fairly short.... bar is always uncomfortable for me!   I could understand if this was a busy lunch or dinner time... but it was not!
It's a shame but I suppose Rice Republic is doing well and opts to turn away customers.  
I will not return and will tell a friend or two of my experience."}
{"text":"Went here after a movie in downtown Summerlin. We had a wonderful experience and enjoyed the food. The shrimp dumplings and the beef Taiwanese soup were delicious. The manager Luv is amazing. He made sure we were able to be served even though we got there near closing. He is very open to reviews and I hope all these negative reviewers told him instead of just putting it on the internet. We thought it was wonderful and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Taste like Chinatown but in Summerlin. Good value for the location. The dim sum was quite yummy."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! When I first saw this restaurant in Downtown Summerlin, I honestly didn't think the food here would be great. All of the good Chinese restaurants are in Chinatown aren't they? Although the food is not as awesome as what you would find in Chinatown, I thought it was pretty tasty and filling. My usual order is the BBQ Pork Fried Rice and the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns from their Dim Sum cart. The fried rice is always full of flavor and never dry. Portion size is what you normally see at a Chinese restaurant. I always take home leftovers! Kind of hard to screw up the BBQ Pork buns, but they are usually hot and fresh. One time it seemed like they were sitting out for a while and did not taste as good. It's kind of weird that they even have a Dim Sum cart when the restaurant is small and the tables are so close to each other. Although I have not tried it, my husband likes to order the roast duck here.

Prices are definitely high, but that is expected because they are in Summerlin. Service is unfortunately hit or miss. Sometimes the employees are friendly and attentive. Other times, the waiter or waitress will take your order and then you never see them again. 

I shop at Downtown Summerlin, so I will definitely be back!"}
