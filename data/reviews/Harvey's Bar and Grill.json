{"text":"We are new to the area and have been trying a lot of the restaurants around the area, we seen a groupon for this place for $17 for $30 worth of food and decided to give it a try. We always get food to go at restaurants that are labeled \"bars\" just because we have kids and never know how the atmosphere might be, so last Wednesday I called in our food to go and when I arrived to pick it up they wouldn't accept the groupon. I was very irritated and pulled up the groupon to see if I had missed a \"dine in only\" but there was none. On the groupons fine print BEFORE you buy one they have fine print that tells you the exact terms of your deal. There are absolutely no stipulations of dine in or to go.However, AFTER you pay for this groupon they added in the fine print to please let your waitress know upon sitting down you have the groupon, or to call and make a reservation.Implying it to be used dine in but still not saying it could not be used to go. My husband called back and spoke with the manager/owner who was very rude and unprofessional and told us we should have knew by the reservation and presenting it at the table that you must use it dine in. I would understand more if this was in the fine print before you buy it, but I read the fine print before purchasing it because I knew we would do take out. I talked with groupon and they refunded us the $17 after reading it and telling us they agreed that it was not stated and should have been accepted. So we payed $31 for food that was mediocre and will never go back after the treatment we received. Duckworths is right up the road and tastes much better for the same prices. Also please make sure to make reservations since when we went in there was nobody at a single table except two men drinking at the bar.

I attatched the picture from groupon of their \"fine print\"."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect walking in.  Was I surprised!  The staff was extremely friendly, the food was great and it didn't empty my wallet.  I will without a doubt be going back again!

Just watch the steps down if you've had a few too many."}
{"text":"All draft beers are only $3 on Thursday.  In my previous review I was bummed that dollar beer night was done...but in retrospect that was for one style of beer (usually Pilsner) and after a few I was looking to try something else anyway.  I guess change is good once you find the silver lining!  A friend got 12 wings, swimming, hot.  I love hotter wings and these were in that ballpark."}
{"text":"Harvey's has amazing food and customer service!"}
{"text":"There's such a huge difference in food cosistency between the Huntersville and Cornelius locations. Huntersville has gone downhill - great service but food is subpar. Cornelius has awesome food and subpar service. Seems to me that they need to cross train."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger cooked medium rare, it was nearly burnt with cold onion rings. Attentive waiter, very apologetic about the state of the food. Great location, great beer on tap. I hope this place gets it together."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for brunch and it was delish, but dinner not so good. Their potatoes were good & skins possibly would of been good if we could of eaten them while they were hot. We had to ask for plates, silverware and pretty much everything. I asked for a burger well done & it was still pink, but after my sister's chicken was burnt and she sent it back I didn't bother to send it back. The waitress was inexperienced and failed to realize clearly something was wrong since I didn't eat but 2 bites off the burger. Otherwise the burger had a good flavor from what I tried and the atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"great place, nice and quiet. great food. amazing pizza's. not usually too busy, and pretty fast service. wish they had more specials ($1 beers, 25cent wings,  ect ect ect) i think it would bring in alot more people. i will caution... some times they have live music... but the place is too loud when they have that. i enjoy background music, not music so loud i cant even talk or think. but that is just how i feel. some may enjoy that. its hard to find, its back in a neighborhood. but its worth your time, give it a try! great patio!"}
{"text":"I like this place to have some wings(really good) and pizza(average) while having a beer or three.  I really have never been there for dinner just mostly after 9:00 PM to have some food and drinks.

Friendly staff and good pub food."}
{"text":"we live just a few blocks away.  my husband used to play and sing at the old open mike night.  we dicided to go there for drinks and the bartender, brittany was great!!! she made wonderful drinks.  we will definately be going back often!!  try it, you will love it!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Service was great and food was good. Server name said Apples on receipt. Awesome job."}
{"text":"Great place and a hidden gem! Some of the best service we've experienced in a long time (Aubrey was awesome!)! We sat outside on the patio and it was so relaxing. We ordered nachos, turkey ribs, pork ribs, and the brownie for dessert. Everything was so good but the PORK RIBS were amazing!! We appreciated that the food at Harvey's was very flavorful without a bunch of unnecessary added fat. Great food, relaxing atmosphere, and very reasonable prices. The only menu item I haven't liked so far, is the fish tacos. They were soggy and just not very good but there's plenty of other menu options to choose from!"}
{"text":"Lots of TVs, great for watching a game & cheap drink specials too. The pork nachos were sadly more like \"try to find some pork in these nachos.\" My salad was great though, fresh ingredients. They seemed understaffed on this particular night, our waitress was working the whole bar as well."}
{"text":"We went to this great little place on a spur of the moment decision to grab a beer and a bite after work on Friday. I never would have known about it/found it without the help of someone who has been there before. It is tucked inside a neighborhood, surrounded by townhouses. You go upstairs to find the bar, dining area and outdoor seating on the porch. The first thing I liked: very friendly staff! Next I noticed how casual and comfortable the surrounds were (do not come here if you are seeking a fancy/quiet environment). And the best thing I noticed is that they had a nice selection of craft beers! I had never enjoyed a Palm Belgium Amber (the beer Fat Tire was brewed to be like). Yum!!! It paired well with the bar/pub food menu. We had the chicken nachos and they were delish. This was just what I needed after a tough work week - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night, really crowded & quite loud, making it hard to have a conversation. Everyone raves about the burgers, but not me...asked for medium got well done!! Waitress said she'd redo but didn't feel like waiting again when it already had taken quite some time.  Sweet potato fries, nothing special either. My wife had the fish tacos which were very good. 
Finally didn't look at the bill closely and when we got home realized we were overcharged on our drinks...so how impressed was I ...not too much."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place yesterday. Our first time there using a \"GoPlaySave\" coupon.  We were greeted by the owner, and even with knowing we had a coupon, he treated us very well.  The service from wait staff great as well. The food was really good. We had the chicken sandwiches, and they were really moist and tasty. Great ceasar salad and fries too.  We will be going back for sure. That's the good thing about the coupons, you get to try new places and then return if you like it, and we will be returning here."}
{"text":"Harvey's is very unique in that a local neighborhood literally has their own bar and grill. We tried this place out the first time because of a restaurant.com coupon, and we were surprised to be turning into a community on our way to get there. Before we knew it the street opens up and there is Harvey's right on the corner of one of the town home units. 

The place is two floors, the first one looks to be restaurant tables only, so we walked to the top floor to enjoy the bar area. They have a nice large open area upstairs with a large bar that has plenty of seats and several tables. They also have a wrap around outside patio seating area that is a favorite among most patrons there on a nice day. 

They have a good selection on tap and we had to spend a lot on food to use our coupon so we sampled it all, appetizers, entrees, and dessert and everything was great. 

Atmosphere of this place is very nice and even if you don't live in the neighborhood everyone is very welcoming. They have pool tables, a dart board, jukebox, and free live music on certain nights. 

We have been several more times, and this is a nice chill spot to take out of town guests, if you want to hang out in a bar with friends, but still be able to carry a conversation with each other. 

Appalachian State University headquarters too for you Boone grads looking for your local team fans in Huntersville. 

One knock, this neighborhood is a black hole for AT&T signals. Don't expect to get many calls or check in at this place with ease. Good news is they have free wifi, and the key is usually the 7 digit bus. phone number."}
{"text":"My hood's bar.  Can't get any better than that.  Awesome buffalo chicken pizza!"}
{"text":"Poor food quality, quantity, and presentation. We ordered chips and guacamole, but the chips were slightly stale and mostly broken as if we'd been given the bottom of the bag; plus, the portion of chips was too small to finish the guacamole. The potatoes that came with the steak were frozen, not fresh, and my whole meal was served lukewarm.  The fries served with my wife's burger were a very skimpy portion size.  The brownie and vanilla ice cream dessert was really bad: the ice cream tasted freezer-burned and the brownie was literally burned.  Another waitress even came by and asked if it was burned because she could smell it.  We said, \"Yes, it's burned and inedible\", and she took it away,but they still charged us $6 for it on the bill.  

Service was very good: our waitress was very attentive, polite, and kept our drinks filled.  I tipped 20% on a $50 meal, because it wasn't the waitress' fault, but I can't go spend money here again.  It was poor overall, especially charging me for an inedible, burned dessert."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood this bar is located. Good place to go have a quick drink. Food is above average and the servers/bartenders are always nice. If you are looking to party hard this is probably not the place for you... It's usually pretty slow with a middle aged adult crowd. Good place to watch a game or chill and have a drink without getting bumped into by 500 college kids every two seconds."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on Friday night and had a great experience.  I got the black bean burger and my husband got the shrimp tacos and we loved both.  The side salad was fresh and large and the homemade jalapeño ranch dressing was wonderful.  Our waiter was quite possibly the best I've ever experienced in my life - attentive, knowledgeable, and full of suggestions.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good waitress but food was horrible. Management didn't seem to care about repeat business. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Cool bar with a very chill crowd.  Interesting location but if I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably be a regular.  Heard the name has changed."}
{"text":"Can't review for food, only for service - which was so rude and uninterested that we left before even being seated. If you're not a local or a regular, no one at the store, or on the phone for that matter, can be bothered. We were really looking forward to the crawfish boil, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Hadn't updated on Harvey's if 5 years!  Still loving it! Menu was updated, food quality has never been more consistent. Lot's of televisions and just a good place to grab a brew, and some food. Solid, Solid place and worth your discovery!  A great neighborhood bar and grill!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the atmosphere is awesome!  I've been several times now, and the service is always poor."}
{"text":"Great little gem of a place on the second floor of the building in a quiet community. Lovely outdoor seating area and a super friendly staff. It was our first time here and we were excited to try it. We got the guacamole and salsa appetizer, pesto alfredo chicken pasta and buffalo chicken hoagie for dinner, and the peer pressure brownie for dessert. It was all wonderful and tasted delicious. A casual place with a homey appeal. We loved it! We will be back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. After seeing a Groupon and reading reviews for this place we thought we'd give it a try. We found it to be average, nothing special and not worth the time it took to find it.

Pros
Staff was friendly and you could tell they wanted customer service to be what you remembered when visiting this place. 

Cons.
Food was average. I got a caesar salad with blackened chicken. Only 4 tiny strips of chicken, and while the salad was fresh it wasn't anything special. Hubby got ribs and fries. He likes but again said wasn't anything to write home about. Potato skins came out burnt.

Located up a flight of stairs. We wonder how many dunks fall down each weekend. It's def more a bar than a restaurant.

Location is strange. It's nestled inside a very residential area. Reminded me of trying to be a Baxter Village in Ft. Mill or Ayrsley town in south Charlotte but there's not much else there.

Conclusion- go if you're bored with other groupons but don't expect much."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time last night.  We had an awesome waitress and loved the atmosphere. It did get a little loud but it is a bar and the ladies night out table behind us was having a good time.  We left just as the live music was starting (9ish). The beer selection was good and we were all pleased with our meal.  I had the Korean bbq sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The fries were awesome.  The bun for the sandwich was my favorite thing.  I had never had Korean bbq sauce before and it wasn't for me.  But there were lots of other things on the menu that I want to try.  My hubs had a burger. It had the same bun as the bbq sandwich.  He asked for his burger to be cooked medium and they nailed it.  Our friend had the spinach artichoke chicken and said it was excellent.  The veggies that came with it looked amazing and he said even the rice was better than most places.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and some drinks. This place is a bit secluded, but is located in the center of a small town and is actually quite quaint. The beer selection was decent, but I wish they had a bit more to choose from. The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. We had burgers and wings, and both were delicious. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great local place to watch football. Fresh food and inexpensive drinks. Go Panthers! Good service as well."}
{"text":"We recommend Harvey's for group functions. Huntersville 101 Alumni group held a social event there 11/2/16. The service was friendly and we enjoyed the variety of appetizers. The atmosphere is casual and it was nice to have a corner to ourselves on the second floor."}
{"text":"First time at Harvey's and we would go again! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly, accommodating and prompt. Food was delicious. Philly cheesesteak was tasty and the burger was cooked just right. We were very close to giving 5 stars, but both our sides were wrong. However, what we got was still delicious."}
{"text":"Upon getting out of the car in the Vermillion neighborhood and walking to the front door of the newly-reopened Tin Pan Alley (the bar formerly known as Harvey's), my roommate's girlfriend spied a street sign that read: Tin Pan Alley. 
\"Oh,\" she said. \"That's where it gets its name!\" 

With that mystery solved, we opened the front door and climbed the staircase to the upstairs bar and...virtually everything was the same as Harvey's. Same hardwood floors, rectangular bar, same sports posters, banners and memorabilia peppered on the walls (that I could tell...there might have been a few different pieces).

The lone pool table was in the same location, the hand-powered shuffleboard table (so much fun!) still against the back wall.

The place is not big, but it does have a number of TVs and enough drink specials and events such as trivia night and live music to keep people returning. 

My favorite on this particular Trivia Night was the $1 PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon) cans. I remember PBR mostly for being the beer upperclassmen would force pledges to drink in college. On this night, with little money in my wallet, it was the nectar of the gods. 

This was also the first time I had eaten here, or even looked at the menu, so I can't say how much or even if the selection had changed. The menu was full of sandwiches, pizzas, calzones and appetizers. I had a calzone which was excellent,and grabbed a stray chicken finger off someone's plate, which was also tasty. 

In the end, I was out the door with a total tab under $20, so I was very pleased. 

So what have we learned?
For someone looking for a low-key scene with lots of sports bar atmosphere and good beer specials, it is a good choice. 

We also learned that PBR is made in Milwaukee. Says so on the can. Who knew?"}
{"text":"Over the tracks, thru the woods and up a steep set of steps.

Been here several l times but for some reason, have never written a review of it. My wife and I had our annual eye exams in Huntersville and by the time we got our of the office, traffic on I-77 was a mess.

Decided to go to Harvey's since we had not been here in awhile. From the title, from Downtown Huntersville, you go over the railroad tracks heading east, Huntersville - Concord Rd is tree lined and you turn right on Cinnabar and drive to the town square and Harvey's is on the top floor of a building up a steep set of stairs.

It;s a Sports Bar owned by an Appalachian State U Grad so you can guess the motif. Tastefully done with Carolina Panther mixed in.

Nice decor and lay out. Not fancy but functional. Staff is excellent and well trained so our service was excellent.

Promptly greeted and seated and the normal stuff in a very efficient and friendly manner. Great server.

My wife chose a Steak Salad which was served over Fries which she enjoyed. She's from Pittsburgh so she's experienced with the Primanti Bros thing on combining your dinner with Fries. In any case, very good.

I had the Greek Chicken Wrap which captured the essential flavors of Greece. Excellent choice. The wrap was delicious although I will admit I would have preferred it on  Pita.

Fun place to go. Food is good and service is great and prices are reasonable.

Great place but a bit hard to find but worth it."}
{"text":"So our waitress was awesome, food was ok problem was with the management.  We went to dinner at 5:30 on a college football Saturday.  When we sat down there was only one other table in the whole restaurant.  I asked the lady in charge to change one of the TVs from the NFL network which was showing an interview of Super Bowl II to the Alabama vs Texas AM game.  She asked for the game and station which I repeated and she looked back at me picked up her water drank it and then walked off.  Never turned the TV never checked back in.  I've never seen anything like it before.  I was with my family but looking for a place to host a happy hour, I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Been a long time patron of this place, the uniqueness and quality of food and great service makes me feel like I am the big man on campus when I visit.  

Wings are the best in the area and the bar service is on top of things.   Enjoy a cigar on the New Orleans style patio deck overlooking the town square.  

Prices are very fair and families feel welcomed.  

Definitely a Gem in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"Really tasty wings with plenty of meat. 
Extra $.50 for really hot (well, pretty hot). 
Several local beers on tap. Bottom floor has been renovated into a full service restaurant that I'll try next time. 
Almost empty with just 2 other patrons on an early Friday afternoon. Server was friendly, without being overbearing. She encouraged me to come back when it as busier and \"more fun\""}
{"text":"Harvey's has become one of my favorite bars in Huntersville. It is tucked away inside the middle of the Vermillion neighborhood and right above Block Bistro. Parking is usually easy to find but mostly on the street that surrounds the building. 

Any night is a good night to go, it definitely gives me that \"Cheers\" vibe because everyone seems to know each other and I usually see the same people each time I go. The bartenders are really friendly and always take good care of you. 

There are a few menu favorites I have. The buffalo chicken dip is great! I usually order it for a snack or something light to eat when we come in just to watch Friday Night Lights after a Hough football game.. Go Huskies! Its not too spicy and even though I am not a fan of Blue Cheese Im not even able to taste the Blue Cheese in the dip. 

The wings are the usual go to when I come in. Several wing flavors but my usual is Mild wings or Thai Chili, I do wish there were lemon pepper wings though. Either way, wings are really good and are always great when ordered with a side of French fries or Cajun Adams roasted potatoes. I don't really know exactly what the seasoning or sauce is on the potatoes but they are a must try!! Absolutely my favorite item on the menu, I can order the Cajun Adams roasted potatoes by themselves and be perfectly happy lol.

Harveys is the perfect place to enjoy a Panthers game on Sundays or an App State game on Saturdays ( Harveys is an App State bar but I'm not an App State fan, sorry not sorry lol). There are always drink specials or maybe someone buying all the Panther fans a round of shots after a win :)"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this week. I loved the atmosphere and food so much that I want to move to the neighborhood. It's a shame a didn't know about this place when I first moved to Huntersville and was looking for a cool neighborhood hangout. I hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Every place I have called home, I have always had one bar, one bar that I could meet my husband at after work to unwind, one bar that I could go watch 'the game', one bar that just feels like home.  I have been searching far and wide for this kind of bar in the Huntersville area and don't worry everyone.... I HAVE FOUND IT!!

Just like Toby Keith's song \"I love this bar.... it's my kind of place...\"  I do love this bar and it is just my kind of place.  They people working there are great, the beer is good and I haven't had any food yet but I am sure that will be good too.  Can't wait to become a regular. :-)"}
{"text":"Every now and then I eat at a place that leaves me wondering if I paid too much. This is one of those place. I've been here a couple times and they're food isn't bad considering it's bar food. The location is great and it's never been crowded when I've gone.

It has a downstairs dining area and an upstairs bar area equipped with a pool table. The service is nice and friendly and the bar is clean. 

I've had their pesto pasta and I enjoyed it and I've also had their burger which was meh. My only issue is they seem a little pricey. I had a burger, appetizer and 1/2 ribs and paid almost 50$ to me that seems a bit pricey. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Love everything about Harveys, staff is awesome and food never disappoints! Owners are very good people!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer and drink specials. Nice casual atmosphere great for drinks with friends or dinner with the family"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and don't know why I haven't wrote a review! Hard to find, it's tucked away in the vermillion neighborhood. Steep steps to get up to the restaurant. Sat outside on the patio & at the bar. Came originally on a groupon and been back. It's typical bar food, drinks. They have a pool table by the bar. It's always busy!"}
{"text":"Like this bar! It is in the middle of the neighborhood, so I took me longer to find it. There is no really a parking lot for the bar but curb parking. Wine is not expensive at all and wings are pretty good (a little under-cooked to me though). Overall, it is a very good spot hanging out with friends. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Cornelius location for Harvey's B&G.  Hubby and I went there for the 1st time last evening.  We liked the food choices and having read a glowing review of the Fish Tacos, decided to try them along with the Southern Roast Beef Dip sandwich.  The side salad as a choice of side was simple and plentiful.  The actual entrees, while fresh and tasty, are more lunch than dinner size in our opinion.  We  would have appreciated a slightly larger size.

Unlike other sports bars and grills that tend to be so noisy you can barely hold a conversation, we liked that while monitors were going with several channels to choose from, it was not noisy.  We noted the audio dampening panels overheard.
If portion sizes are to remain the same, then I would recommend this place for lunch vs. dinner.  You don't want your patrons to leave hungry, after all. ;)"}
{"text":"Great place, especially if you live in the neighborhood!  Good food, beer, and service has always been pleasant."}
{"text":"After reading a Herald local periodical review, we decided to try it out. Very nice ambiance  and comfortable, lots of TVs  for sports and games. Very poor selection of beers and ales and pricey at that. Food is mediocre at best, small portions for bucks. Bartender not friendly or customer caring. For the appetizer foods we ordered, Chili\"s food blows them out of the water. Will not go back , my spouse wonders how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Restaurant is in a neighborhood.  Kind of cool.  It is two stories with patio seating. 

Ordered the skins app.  Delicious. 

I had the sirloin with rice and fruit.  Rice portion was a child's size.  Ordered more with no problems.  

My girl had a grilled chicken wrap with fruit.   She also liked hers.  

Waitress was attentive. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice place for food and to catch some good football games. Food is fantastic. Service is great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I like Harvey's!  The food is good, standard bar food with a bit of a top notch taste (I can only speak to the \"snacks\" and appetizers).  I wouldn't necessarily bother with the Nachos as these are pretty much what you can make from home, but everything else is really quire yummy!  The setting is great! Casual neighborhood bar, high and low top tables, family friendly but turns into m ore of a bar scene later in the evening.  I like it and will def. be back!  I guess the charm of it being in a neighborhood is what keeps it a bit private and never too busy!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Huntersville and stopped in Harvey's for dinner.  Service was excellent.  The food was very good and reasonable.  Burger and steak cooked exactly liked we ordered. They also had specials on draft beer and house wine.  The only problem  was finding the place.  Now that I know where it is located, I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"A great off the beaten path bar and grill that blends good beer, great ambience and a good menu! If they focus on maintaining quality food they will do well!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Friendly service. Wings were solid. Had my usual three beers. First two were great, but they ran out. Switched to different tap and  the beer seemed a little cloudy/strange. Drank it anyway (slowly). First time I didn't feel great from drinking in more than a decade. Nothing serious just strange/headache. 

Went with friend. We were there from about 7-10, then talked in parking lot. While in parking lot, a lot of people started heading inside. So, we missed the crowd. Therefore, I don't have much info on bar scene. 

For the restaurant, it looks like you can eat upstairs (including balcony) or downstairs (including porch). 

Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for lunch and had a great time. Food was ok, drinks were good and music playing was good. Nice family friendly neighborhood bar. Love the layout and the outdoor seating.

Thanks"}
{"text":"I started going to Harvey's because of my weekly kickball games. I love this place! Great food. Great staff. You just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great bar and great owners! Perfect if you live in the Vermillion neighborhood or not. Owners Charlie and Luke are always adding fantastic food to their already extensive menu. From the bar food classics such as wings and fries to their great burgers and fresh sandwiches, you just can't go wrong at Harvey's. Great daily drink specials, and plenty of selections of beer on tap. Service is always excellent and the staff know many patrons by name. Free poker nights on Mondays, and live music on various other nights."}
{"text":"Such a weird location but enjoyed the food. We used to go to the one in Cornelius so wanted to try this one. The waiter was so so and the fries were cold but he took them back and reheated them. Love their wings"}
{"text":"Must try the fish tacos and buffalo chicken pizza. A few of our favorites! A great place for a casual meal!"}
{"text":"I moved to North Carolina 7 months ago and into my community 45 days later.  We immediately discovered Harvey's and I can't say enough.  The staff is friendly and always available for a request or refill of water and tea.  The food is amazing.  I went to the bar last night to watch the Panthers game and finally tried the ribs (I usually get the wings with the Asian sauce, AMAZING), but wanted ribs.  I've been searching for good ribs since moving here and I finally found them.  They were fall off the bone tender and the sauce!  Charlie needs to bottle the stuff.  If you're in Huntersville and want great food, good community and so many beers on tap, come to Harvey's!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.

My sister in law had her wedding rehearsal dinner here and the food was excellent and flawlessly executed. I can't even remember everything we had but it was all very fresh, tasty and properly cooked.

The bartender was fast & courteous.

The people bringing out food were really nice to us even though there were about 75 people in one big room and they needed to maneuver through us all. 

The only that sucks is that there is no changing table in the ladies room for babies. I had to change my daughter on the floor (gross). For a place that's in the middle of family ville, you would think they could install a changing table for us young moms out there."}
{"text":"What a great pub/sports bar.  Very nice atmosphere, food was solid...lots of drink and dinner specials...waitstaff (Amy) was on point.  No complaints at all.  On top of that, the prices are right...I WILL BE BACK!!!  Would love to visit my friends sometime when you are having a crawfish boil or what have you!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews and stopped in on Friday evening to check it out.  The word that comes to mind is average. No complaints at all mind you. But nothing exceptional about Harvey's at all. Average wings, average beer list, average atmosphere. I'll take that back. The neighborhood is unusual for a bar.  I'll be back if I'm in the area but there are other average spots closer to home."}
{"text":"At the risk of being unpopular, I'm going to say that our experience with Harvey's left me with an average experience. On first glance the place seemed pretty cool, but as the time wore on I became less impressed with the place. Mind you, I'm approaching this review from a \"diner\" perspective where I'm focusing a lot on the food.

It's location is pretty weird as it's in the midst of a community of homes. Upon walking in the door it's also a bit confusing as there are two floors, and we didn't know which one to head to. Since there was absolutely no one on the ground floor restaurant area we headed upstairs to the bar area which was a bit more lively. The bar is big and open with plenty of space. There were a decent number of tables and high tops, and the bar itself was spacious. I was surprised to see parents sitting around with their little kids. We kinda stood at the entrance for a couple of seconds taking it all in and deciding if we seat ourselves or not, until a server saw our confused stares and invited us to pick a seat.

We sat down at one of the high tops and one server came over promptly. He suggested the draft deal of the night ($3 Red Oak)  which my wife took, but I wanted to see which beers were on tap. I was about to take a look at the menu posted on a chalkboard but he knew his beer enough that he was able to suggest a beer based on the kind of style I was looking for. He suggested a stout ($5 BB Aces & Ates) that I ended up enjoying, and was pleased that he was able to do that.

The menu was a bit lacking but is to be expected from a bar menu. There were the usual apps like wings and mozzarella sticks, as well as salads, sandwiches, burgers and pizzas. The miss' and I decided to split an order of the mozz sticks ($5.75) since it had been ages since we had them. They were served hot and fresh, and the marinara sauce had a very slight spice to it. 

For dinner I ordered the half rack of ribs ($9.99) which were decent but not much more. The ribs were tender and came off the bone in one big meaty strip which I would then dunk in the extra little cup of sauce. I wasn't too keen on the sauce, which was really think and spicy. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against a thick sauce, but it was more like a processed sauce. It also came with a choice of side and I went with the white cheddar mashed potatoes. They were pretty good with the red skins still intact and the cheese flavor was mild and not overpowering.

The miss' got the vegetable pizza ($9.50) and was not impressed. The pizza is huge, and probably bigger than the individual pizzas you would get at Brixx. However the quality of the pizza was extremely lacking. Just looking at it you could tell it was a mediocre pie. The sauce was extremely bland and the pizza wasn't really cheesy. The dough itself was mushy, and for the kind of pizza it was I would have liked to have seen a bit more of a crunch to it.

Harvey's is probably a good place to head out for a beer and bar apps, but not the kind of place I would return to for a dinner. The menu is not only limited but the execution is lacking. If I wanted a beer and a pizza I would much rather go to Brixx, where the beer menu is more extensive, cheaper and the pizza is a much higher quality product."}

{"text":"We ended up here after finding a cheap gift certificate on restaurant.com. The way the GPS took us was weird (right through a neighborhood), and then you have to go upstairs after you enter through the front, so we were a little wary at first, but ended up really liking this place!

We've been about 4 times now (even though it isn't exactly around the corner from us) but the service is always on point, everyone is friendly, and it's a nice laid back casual atmosphere. It's also pretty cheap, and the food is pretty good. We usually start with their wings and order burgers or pizza for dinner. 

I think what I like best about this place and what keeps us coming back is the atmosphere - it IS a neighborhood bar, and that's exactly what it feels like! Pair that with the friendly staff and the prices and it's a winner.

We've since found a more direct route, but don't be fooled, it is really right in the heart of a bunch of townhouses. I'm kind of glad I don't live there, if I did I'd probably be there every night."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, always at lunchtime, always on a weekend. Both times it's been excellent ... great food, fantastic service, and a friendly, comfortable atmosphere. It's surprisingly empty on Saturdays at lunchtime, which is nice, especially if you want to enjoy the patio. Overall, a great place to have lunch, enjoy a drink, and just hang out."}
{"text":"Harvey's is a charming tucked away restaurant and bar. They were fairly crowded for a Thursday night, but the service was still fantastic! They have awesome drink specials. Their appetizers are decent - we tried the chipotle guacamole. I'm not sure that I'd order it again, but it wasn't bad. Their main entrees were good. I enjoyed the pesto alfredo pasta and my husband liked the honey Swiss chicken. My only complaint would be the parking was a bit of a pain - even still, we'll definitely visit Harvey's again!"}
{"text":"Good draft beer variety 
Overall decent food 
Good service
Does probably need to buy bar new stools though."}
{"text":"They did a nice job hosting a surprise birthday party for a friend this weekend in their downstairs area.  The main bar and dining area is upstairs and it's interesting to watch the servers go up and down the stairs since the kitchen is on the ground floor.  No need for a Stairmaster workout after a shift at Harvey's.

Was not impressed with the food that was served at the party however.  Perhaps because it was prepared for a party buffet but it was all just average at best.  3 kinds of pizza, chicken breasts which looked like they were topped with some sort of marmalade, spinach artichoke dip and some mixed green salad with raspberry vinaigrette.  Not one bit of if made me think, \"oh, I can't wait to come here for a meal sometime.\"

The staff was quite friendly and attentive during the party though and it was a good space to host an event like that so, high marks on the service side of things."}
