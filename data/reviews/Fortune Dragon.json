{"text":"The WORST Chinese take-out food I have ever seen and tasted . . . THE WORST EVER !

The 'sweet & sour chicken' order was packaged with the fried chicken in one box secured with a dirty rubber band and the cold sweet-and-sour sauce packaged in a separate container with no vegetables . . . I also ordered the 'plain fried rice' which looked liked it was pre-packaged and to add insult to the injury was super sticky and had a clear glossy film appearance . . . This is the first time I order anything from this place and will most definitely be the last . . . Overall the food looked dreadful and extremely unappetizing . . . Shame and disgrace on this establishment for the extremely low quality of food served here, it is vile and unacceptable . . . Consider yourself warned !

Also, I hope every penny I spent on this horrible order curdles in the restaurant owner's stomach . . . !"}
{"text":"Most terrible place to order food! I asked for pepper steak with onions , she gave me 3 tiny strips of steak with lots of green peppers and carrots !! I asked why ? She was rude and argued how it is ! I said if it's steak mixed with vegetables you should say that then , she argues saying those are not vegetables!!! Worst place !!! Never again"}
{"text":"Disgusting as hell. The soup is gross along with their red color noodles. I will never go here again. Gross. I wasted 12.00 I dumped the food after one bite."}
{"text":"The lunch and combo platters are pretty good.  However, their standalone dishes aren't as good. Ordered the lobster with shrimp and minced pork. There was no pork and the lobster sauce is a watery no flavour substance. Also ordered the Cantonese chow mien. Asked them if it was crispy chow mien with sauce on top, they said yea, but it was soggy and it was not good. Definitely not worth 9.95. I've had better in scarbz for 5 bucks which was a similar non crispy chow mien. Their saving grace is their fried rice. Both chicken and beef fried rice have plenty of meat and tastes pretty good.  They have meat dishes but it's mostly veggies than meat. It's good to have tons of veggies if your trying to be \"healthy\", but then again, why order Chinese food if your goal is to be healthy?  Given, the veggies are super fresh, but If you want only meat, it is an extra two dollars.  Better to stick with the lunch special and combination platters, they are 5.25 and 7.95, respectively.  Those are pretty good deals, given the tasty fried rice, lots of meat (if you get sweet and sour pork or similar meat only dishes, an egg roll in huge quantities."}
{"text":"Top shelf on the wonton soup. Some of the best I have tasted.  

I will be back guy to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure how to rate this place. First time trying this place was with family and we order bunch of stuff.  Overall impression was not great.   Mainly due to the taste.  There were friend rice and noodle dish among others.  We found it was either bland or just tastes different than any other place.  
My usual order for chinese takeout is beef black bean sauce.  Tried this place for 2nd time recently and order this, and again, the taste is very very different from every other place.  Even chicken wings aren't exactly the same.  I find the price might be a bit higher (maybe $1 or so, depending on the item). $9 something for the black bean, but you do get a decent amount. Enough to fill you up for sure.  Place seems pretty busy, but personally, can't say I am a fan of the tastes."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work for quick Chinese take out. Service was fine and didn't have to wait long for the food. Ordered d vegetable fried rice, chicken w/black bean sauce, sweet and sour shrimp, and shrimp w/lobster sauce. Rice was average and a little bland, the chicken and black bean sauce was all green peppers and onions. There was bout 8 small pieces of chicken. Lobster sauce was weird as it wasn't the typical brown coloured sauce but instead clear white. Sweet and sour shrimp tasted fine (like all others). I probably won't come back here again unless I'm desperate for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I used to love ordering food from here when I wanted my Chinese food craving satisfied. Until my last visit that has changed. The food was VERY oily and bland. The chicken pieces were full of fat and absolutely disgusting. It's unfortunate that this place has let their quality to fall to such a low, but I guess that's expected from these \"quick serve\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Alright alright alright found this lil gem beside Lazeezs. Its a chinese restaurant that has a really good lunch combo price and if you order take out you're good to go.  Their lunch menu is priced at $5.80 plus taxes and you get 1 of their combo meals plus a can of pop or spring roll. The meal is packaged in a medium take out box. Like whoa all this for $6 something which is freshly made on the spot not bad at all for a small resto like this.  I ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice and a spring roll.  Honestly this is not bad at all its like Manchu wok but fresher and doesnt hit the wallet that hard.  This is a good go to quick chinese food fix to have by yourself.  Eating with friends, family or co workers i would suggest something else in that area for this place isnt equip to handle everybody's flavour. Definitely a repeat??!?!??!? No doubt for a quick fix. Check it out if you get a chance and stick with the chicken rice combos i havent tried other stuff but keep it simple and the payload will be simple. 
Mamba Out!!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Had the chicken with black bean sauce, no complaints.
Lunch special deal is pretty good. For about $5 you get a filling meal and a drink."}
{"text":"Order general Tao chicken and it wasn't spicy and was very bland. I the rice in the dish was lacking vegetables. Came with two broccoli on top."}
