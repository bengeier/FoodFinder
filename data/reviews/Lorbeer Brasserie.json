{"text":"We came in for happy hour and ordered the beef tartar which was delicious. We had to ask for more bread for our dish and it was given to us without any questions. When we asked for the wifi the waitress relayed our question to the bartender who was very short with her. It was time for us to leave and unfortunately  it started pouring rain outside so my husband asked the bartender if there were any umbrellas to borrow, instead of saying no, he was extremely rude and condescending and pretended he couldn't understand english. So in conclusion: food and drinks great, service good, bartender pompous."}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer and hang out with friends. the food menu is interesting but we were disappointed with our dishes, looks good on the menu tastes ok."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice,  the drinks are decent but dont go here for the food, seriously. I had a 20$ pasta dish that was flavorless ans just thrown on a small plate...where's the love?!  I never add salt to my food but this  was one circumstance where salt and pepper on the table would've been very handy. Maybe they should just stick to booze. Not to mention the staff who seems more preoccupied chatting with friends/colleagues than paying attention to customers."}
{"text":"Excellent place to hangout with friends or for a date. Cozy & casual, and chic and trendy at the same time.   Their terrasse in the summer is just perfect on Laurier. Love the place for their drinks (unique mix of beer and wine), the plates to share (little asian wraps and meatball) were delicious.  I would go back anytime, the service is awesome and the people are so kind. It is really a place I recommend for happy hour with food in the area or a snack before a show or theater."}
{"text":"Very cute place with great decoration however, Very bad service, waitress took my friends glass before she was finished, took orders before everyone had arrived, was rude. Bad fried chicken with water tasting gravy. Drinks were O.k."}
{"text":"Nous avons reçu un accueil extra lors du dernier événement Yelp Elite! Les gérants nous ont permis de goûter cinq de leur bières fabriquées sur place ainsi que trois plats. Déjà, nous avons eu de super explications de leur part autant sur les bières que le repas ainsi qu'une petite visite de l'arrière chambre où leur délicieux nectar est fabriqué. Petit tartare de saumon en entrée avec un assaisonnement parfait, poulet braisé et rôti avec une salade de choux et purée de pdt et des ribs DÉLICIEUSES pour finir. Tout était très bon."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick salad and beer before an event and I was super impressed and pleased with how delicious and fresh the salad was - really not what you usually expect from a beer bar but this was amazing! Market fresh grilled asparagus, crunchy sweet pecans, local greens, really great on a hot day. The house blonde beer was nice too, very easy drinking and bright, and it's cool to see right into where the beer is made from inside that back of the bar. Pretty patio too out on a nice old stretch of Laurier!"}
{"text":"I went to Brasserie Lorbeer for my first Yelp event. We were served 5 different beers, along with a 3 course menu, and were given a tour of the brewery.  I really enjoyed their beer selection which are from the West Shefford Brewery in Bromont. They were diverse and each had noticeable, although subtle, extra tastes, like honey in the blond, or chocolate in the stout. It definitely felt like a lot of efforts were put into each beer. I also felt like the beers married perfectly with our food. Kudos to the Lorbeer staff for the arrangements. Don't hesitate to ask them for advices in that regard.  Speaking of food, we had salmon tartare on a fresh salad, spicy chicken, and ribs. I especially enjoyed the ribs, which melted right off the bones, and were generously soaked in a delicious sauce. The chicken was good too, and is a nice nod to the former Laurier BBQ restaurant located there, a local favorite for many years prior to its closure. By the way, Lorbeer will always serve chicken to honor that.  The brewery visit was also very nice and informative, I'd like to thank the staff for that as well. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you want nice beer and good food in a casual place, Lorbeer is the place to be.vWent here for an event and had never had so many different types of beers all at once. I'm not a big beer fan but those ones were in the great amount of alchohol. Doesnt get you too drunk soo its a fair amount.   We also had a samon starter which was something I've never had. It's a small tapas plate that is very simple but delicious. But my favorite was the ribs, they had a very nice sauce with it and was sooo good. Would definetely recommend here."}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 people and we decided to try this new bar on Laurier, the Lor beer. The place was jam packed the atmosphere was nice. Nice selection of beer and drinks! Here where it gets disappointing; the food menu and service.  We ordered 4 plates: chili cheese fries, fried chicken, salmon tartar and octopus salad.  It took 1 hour and half to receive the chili fried!!! This is ridiculous and the excuse was because the bar is full busy...what is the link between the kitchen and the bar...  The kitchen needs to improve the seasoning of their dishes.  The bourbon sauce with the fried chicken was blank and too liquidy. The chicken rub was like PFK style...I've seen way better. The octopus salad was the best choice of the night. The salmon tatar needs more salt and seasoning.   Conclusion: the ambiance for a get together and have few drinks in group is excellent but the kitchen has potential but needs to review their seasoning. Ill come back for a drink but not for food."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday, we had a reservation for 15 and when we arrived the tables were not set, I had to help the manager to figure out how to put the tables. The waitress was a little bit lost and rude. I think she should have not been working for diner time but only at the bar or later because she looked like someone with no training or experience as a waiter.  The food was really disapointing. We had almost everything on the menu and everything was disapointing. The salmon tartar was flat with almost no taste. Same thing for the octopus salad and the fried chicken , which was bot really fried.  My advice is go there for a drink. Do not eat there. Poout service, poor food."}
{"text":"This will be short but sweet: If you love beer and good food, then it's definitely a good place to meet up with friends. Definitely will be back again!"}
