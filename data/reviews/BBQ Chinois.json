{"text":"The lamb is amazing and staff is very nice! The food is authentic and really good, must try the lamb BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is the first place we found in Montreal for Chinese BBQ, which I would say very authentic and make me miss home. The lamb shashlik is awesome. Also try the Oyster BBQ, really great!"}
{"text":"Went there because a friend suggested it. Not the the typical chinese restaurant food. Their specialties are their Meet brochettes. Apperently their lamb skewers are there specialty,but they were nothing spectacular.

We ordered around 15 different brochettes, from lamb,kidney,heart, chicken wings. A soup and a fried rice.
Everything was way too salty, Even the melon soup and fried rice.

The only thing that was descent is the oyster.

The bill came up to 105$ for tax and tip incl for 3 people.
I would not go back to this place ever again because it's too salty and not worth the price we paid for."}
