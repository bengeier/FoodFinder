{"text":"Hard to believe but I thought this was the last surviving Chenoys on the planet.What a mistake.Service good but breakfast was the worst we've ever had.Imagine eggs benedict without poached eggs.Imagine potatoe latkes that were so tuff I couldnt cut them.A total joke.No wonder there were few cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded down to 3.  I like Chejoys, I really do however I don't think they have the right price for many items on their menu, if things were on average $2 less across the board, far more patrons would probably find value to come here.   As it stands, the smoked meat is decent, so are the fries and pretty much whatever one was accoustomed to from this place when it used to be called Chenoys.  They're open all day, so drunks enjoy your 3am food! (Note : it was brought to my attention they now close at midnight.... a sign of the times...)"}
{"text":"Super  bonne Pizza  au  smoke  meat.  Dommage que  il  offrent  juste  une  grandeur....  Vaut le coupe  d'etre essayer!!"}
