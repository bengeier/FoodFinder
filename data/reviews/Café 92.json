{"text":"Terrific place!  I love their coffee & food. Staff is incredible friendly & professional. Very convenient location, lots of parking and big terrace during summertime. If you become a regular, you earn your own mug which is tagged and placed on its own spot. Nice ambiance too!   Definitely my favorite coffee shop in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, wonderful hot chocolate, amazing home made  soup....always interesting local artwork,  lovely staff who aim to please....fresh food, really good sandwiches...the list is long.....did I mention the fantastic coffee and the friendly staff.....go there....you' ll go back"}
{"text":"Love the chalk table idea!  The staff is always nice when i go, pretty spacious and good drink&food!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. If you're lucky enough to get a table on the terrace on a nice day, it's the perfect place to read and enjoy some delicious food.  I love the Agua Fresca  (flavours change each day), and the soup of the day (it's always incredible). The roasted veg sandwich is amazing... the raspberry ginger dressing is so good."}
{"text":"It's alright. The coffee is alright. The baked goods are alright. The service is alright. The ambiance is alright. I may go back... but I don't think I would make the effort to. If you're in the area and jonesing for a coffee, might as well stop in as well stop in - you'll be alright."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had been raving about Cafe 92's iced cappuccino, I thought to myself, how great could it be? Amazingly delicious and worth raving about!  I'll keep this short and sweet....  I ordered my iced cap and my first sip was heavenly, yes, heavenly: It was thick and rich thanks to the iced cream in it and it is the perfect consistency. Word of advice, you might want to order it decaf because I was truly wired after drinking it! Definitely strong!   A casual, cozy neighborhood spot that I will be coming to again  when I am craving an iced cap."}
{"text":"On my never ending search for good coffee, stumbled onto this place while in the area visiting a friend. I'm not around the area much, so I wasn't familiar, but it seems it's a pretty popular neighborhood  place! I was very pleased with the double tall late, asked the lady working there to put some extra chocolate on top and she wasn't shy about it, not like one of those places that count every flake of powder. She made it exactly how I wanted it, not how she though it's best, and I just love places that know how to treat a customer. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Good ambience and accommodating staff. Im not a coffee shop kinda guy, and you'll almost never see me order food in one, cafe 92 being the exception. Everything I've tried has been tasty. I recommend the iced cappuccino. The best I've ever had, puts all the others to shame.  I am, as previously stated, not a coffee shop enthusiast by any means so my opinion may not be as educated as some, but to me this a four star coffee shop for someone with a two star wallet and a one star appetite (due to the somewhat small portions). Im not a fan of big meals to go with my coffee anyways, I run primarily on caffeine. The meals are still delicious even if some people might expect a little more."}
{"text":"For a a local cafe near a university campus it doesn't see quite as many students studying as the second cup just down the street. That's my favourite part about Cafe 92, that there's always room that isn't taken up by books and papers and laptops. And the coffee and cakes are great too."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, close-ish to the Loyola campus at Concordia.  Really like the books they have there. I've traded some and think this is an amazing idea.   Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly n eady going.  Fantastic home made soup.  With a Mexican flair.  Both Maria and  Claudia are  from Mexico City. Try the breakfat omlet sandwich or the special of the day. Free wi fi. Careful about parking on Sherbrooke check reserved bus lane am and pm."}
{"text":"Best iced cappuccino!! Very creamy taste, thick and smooth, almost like coffee flavoured smoothie. With a few sprinkles of chocolate power on top. I'm not a coffee drinker but this one makes me feel like I want to go back again! Not that impressed by bakeries, compared with coffee."}
{"text":"Went again for their very excellent iced latte.  Brought it home to sneak some Bailey's Chocolate Cherry in.   Happy Friday!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place to have your coffee, brunch or lunch.... Be careful it is so addictive!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last week for a little latte break and chat with a friend. The latte was smooth and the consistency of the steamed milk was really on point, plus I appreciated the cute foam art on top. We both had some dense oatmeal-type cookies with large chocolate chips. They were quite filling but could have used a few more chocolate chips. We scored one of the last little tables, which are kind of cramped. However, I am looking forward to the warmer weather because I think sitting outside here would be a real bonus. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here many times over past 3 years as it's close to work. The soups are really good, and the lovely cook/proprietor even sells them in containers for take home. The sandwiches for the most part,are processed meat or cold cuts,neither of which I eat, so I never order them. That being said, however; I always resort to ordering their brie/granny smith apple/toasted almond on a crusty baguette,drizzled with honey... mmmmm. The desserts are standard baked goodies....mainly filling cakes and biscotti. Service is ALWAYS courteous,but can be slow during busy workday lunch hours,and this is all the time. Tea and coffee on the so/so side. Good bet if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My new guilty pleasure is coming here for an iced cappuccino, no matter what weather.  Pair that with their daily soup creation and I'm in heaven.  Ive been here countless times and the staff is always so friendly. I've only tried a few food items and so far I have to say everything is on point.  Inside can get a little loud when it's packed, but if you're lucky enough to sit outside, it's quiet considering you're on Sherbrooke.    Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Cozy little neigbourhood coffee shop. Employees are always smiling, and I have never had trouble getting some space to either read or study. The very large windows make it full of light."}
{"text":"I live in one of the apartments above the cafe and I love to come home to the live acoustic music on their terrace. I usually order the iced latte with almond milk because I'm vegetarian and they are very kind and accommodating. A place where you can just chill out and bring your laptop or book and won't be disturbed. So nice and cozy and beautiful on a sunny day. They have good selection with the food, healthy, cold pressed pure natural juice, breakfast/lunch and also something to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. It's awesome"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service the last time I was there. The food was excellent as usual, but on that particular day, the staff was unfriendly to the point of making me feel uncomfortable being there; before this, this little spot was a place where I went to linger over a coffee, and one of THE places that I made a point to go to when I'm in the neighbourhood.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case, and while it's unlikely that I will never go there again, I don't think my next visit will be any time soon."}
{"text":"Love coming here after I've taken my dogs to the dog park  across the street because they always have a \"doggy bar\" outside (e.i a big bowl of water) which I find really nice.  The coffees are uber nice and so are the aguas frescas. The food portions like the quesadilla are tiny and thereby a bit overpriced even though they're done nicely.   Will keep returning!"}
{"text":"Love love love the molletes and coffee here! Also love the staff, Diego is the cutest!"}
{"text":"Used to live in the area going to miss this place so bad from the warm and inviting atmosphere  to the great coffe. And the food! Tastes like something mama makes it has that kind of comforting homie  effect  to it :3"}
{"text":"This is a great little local cafe.  The ambiance and decor is very warm and inviting.   Local artists display their art on the walls.  You can even buy the artwork. Large location with comfortable seating and more than enough tables. The service is friendly and helpful, although sometimes a tad slow.  That being said I've never had an unreasonable wait. Their coffee is authentic and great.  It's not all syrups and sugars, its real espresso with proper froth and milk, depending on your coffee of choice.  They also have almond milk if desired. Their food is homemade and local.  It is a tad on the expensive side, but the quality is unrivalled.  The pastries are great, but those are expensive. I enjoy it here.  Never had a bad experience.  Parking isn't always the easiest, but it's not impossible either. I would easily recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A great neighbourhood Cafe. Not full of studying students with books everywhere that never free up tables. No, mostly locals.   You have to try their soups. They are amazing. The staff is super friendly.   I just discovered they have a satellite cafe at Benny pool. Same great food by horrible location."}
{"text":"Ice Cap is made with ice cream, so its amazing by association. Food is great. Everything is fresh and home made. Breakfast burrito is delicious."}
{"text":"be aware that this lovely place is kid friendly. do. ot hesitate to bring your little kids. But if coule get a little noisy if you were looking for some calm place to study."}
{"text":"I really like this lovely caf√©!! My latte was huge and delicious and even if I did not try anything else, I can tell you that they have a whole range of pastries, cakes and meals that all look decadent. Very close to Loyola campus, there is a lot of seats, some good music and free wi-fi, so it's a great place to study and write your papers. The staff is just so nice!!! I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are amazing. The staff are friendly and welcoming. I also love the artwork and the chalkboard tables, makes the atmosphere really great!"}
{"text":"I live right next to this cafe, and I'm always getting a bite to eat or a coffee. The people that work here are so warm and inviting. They have quite the range of drinks. If you want someone refreshing get the iced hibiscus tea! Their coffee is so good and rich you won't need any sugar or cream. The food is delicious and fresh (you need to try molletes!). If you're looking for a simple sweet cafe to relax at, you need to go here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I looked for a casual place to meet a friend for a bowl of home made soup. My friend spends a lot of time in NYC. There were 2 soups offered that day, a mushroom soup and  barley soup. We each ordered one and tasted each other's. The soups were delicious, the whole grain bread offered with the soup fresh and yummy, and the casual, laid back decor and ambiance made us wonder why we had never heard of this place. Please do go, you will love it. They do not rush you out; we stayed and talked for hours."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood stop to meet friends have a coffee dessert, soup salad or sandwich, quality is excellent, staff is great, tremendous value and a a really nice terrace on a quiet section of Sherbrooke St W.  It's my new go to place for lunch"}
{"text":"Always amazing food - the lunch rush is crazy but if you go around 1pm, you can find a place to sit and relax. The soups are always made from scratch and always delicious. My favourite go to place for comfort food."}
{"text":"Best cappucino in town, consistently good! Try the mexican soup on weekends. Love the fresh baked goods."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since they opened in 2008 and am so happy it's part of my west NDG neighbourhood!   When I walk in these days with my toddler, the person behind the counter starts to prep our usual order :)     Delicious coffee, friendly service, and tasty snacks & soups.  It's quite family-friendly, with a bookshelf with a few toys and books for the little ones.  The chalk-paint top tables make a fun spot for creative moments.     The cafe supports local artists and have an oft-changing display on the cheery burnt orange walls.  Their annual anniversary party (complete with mariachi band!) has become a neighbourhood event.     The one negative is that it's not always the fastest in terms of service - their coffee is all espresso based, so while it's powerful and delicious, it does add wait time.    I will say it is well worth the wait, and am certain I'll continue to be a loyal client for years to come!  Favourite items on the menu:  COFFEE, breakfast burrito, chicken & avocado soup,  molletes with green salsa, and in the summer their iced cappucino (made with ice cream!) can't be beat."}
