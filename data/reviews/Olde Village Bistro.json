{"text":"Is small family own business, friendly service.Huge potion breakfas,reasonable prices,nice."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and the previous reviews are spot on - the place is small and the decor TOTALLY could use an ugrade!  The couple running the place are really friendly and the food is only ok...ive had better.  I got the egg and peameal sandwich and the egg was bit overcooked but the peameal bacon was pretty good.  The place just needs a little sprucing!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall - not recommended for first dates:p. However, don't judge a book by it's cover! I ordered the basic breakfast combo and it was a good ol' greasy diner-esque meal. The portions are generous and a good bang for you buck. A word of caution though, they don't have AC so it gets really hot in there during the summer."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and serving is pretty good. Been there twice and I still can't finish the pancake. Eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, home fries and toast. That's the first plate and the second plate comes with french toast and pancake :D which is sooo good! All for that for about $12.42. Definitely worth it if you are near this hood."}
{"text":"Came here based on all the positive reviews and was looking for an alternative to the usual place of Cora's.   Went on Thanksgiving weekend and it was busy but had no line up. Was seated promptly in the back area. This is a smaller place so it a bit cozier but I wouldn't say it's cramped.   The place looks and feels a bit tired and can use a fresh coat of paint.  We both ordered the big breakfast as we were quite hungry. It does seem like a family run place and looked like a husband - wife team.  First I'll start with the good: -portions are huge -relatively cheap (I would rate this place 1 $ instead of the 2 it has) -bacon was cooked perfectly -friendly service  Bad: -personal preference but found the ham a bit salty and greasy -they bring the check during your meal -food was slow to arrive (we waited a bit over 30 min for our food after ordering. Too long in my opinion for simple breakfast food.) -flies and such near the washroom (where we were seated) -some of the surfaces were too sticky for my liking.  Other than the price and portions this is a pretty standard place. Nothing really stands out."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the service you get here is impeccable. The people are so nice and sincere. Food portions are huge and the food is absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back. One small improvement is the blend of the coffee. I think the quality of the coffee can be better. Overall, great small business!"}
{"text":"Our order took almost 1 hour. We ordered at 1:45PM, and the restaurant wasn't busy. Food arrived at 2:40PM.  The food (Philly cheese steak sandwich) was pretty good when it arrived though."}
{"text":"Deserves no stars, I should take away everyone's stars up on here, I had to wait until the end of my breakfast before someone at my table had to ask for a coffee refill, food was undercooked and soggy, the chef probably has the grill on medium/low heat, someone at my table ordered the large breakfast plate and we didn't get the French toast and pancake with the meal and they only offered to wrap it up for us to take it with us when we left, I got through half my coffee refill when she told us to leave because they needed the table...they should consider turning up the heat on the grill and hiring an extra staff or two, otherwise they should shut down and get out of their kitchen, if they can't/don't want to serve the public then they should consider a alternative career path.  Btw, it was our 1st time there and we were nice patrons and gave them a fair chance to earn our business, best luck to all you who decide to dine at this establishment."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place numerous times and never even noticed it but what a find!  I came for brunch and it's a small place but the owners are lovely. They let us wait in the comfort of our car and called us when our table was ready. Service was slow but given the quality of food and that the place is run by a small family, its understandable.  The food was completely worth the wait. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu omelet which is made with a whopping six eggs. Comes with toast, potatoes, and a massive pancake. The omelet was filled with generous chunks of chicken and asparagus and they are seriously liberal with the hollandaise and cheese.  The rest of the menu looks absolutely delicious and I will definitely be going back. Don't be surprised when the adorable owners ask you to doggy bag the rest of your food (because you will definitely not be able to finish it). The wife (server) and husband (cook) duo definitely take the time to chat with you and they actually remember who you are.  Great experience.  Oh yes, and they get busy on weekends so be prepared to wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfasts I have ever enjoyed. I had the classic benny (eggs benedict) and glad I did; too much food for one person. Friendly service, Top quality, delicious food. One of a kind breakfast creations along with the standards. The place is small and cozy, they have an amazing Staff  they are always smiling and refilling the coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"When we came here the waiter was friendly. They talk to you and try to actually know you! We ordered eggs and bacon, lunch special, and pancakes. They have massive amounts and if you come you will leave full. Service was a bit slow, though the food was great and will come back soon."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks .. Definitely wouldnt recommend or eat here again. Are you people blind or stupid. Did you not see how dirty and unsanitary this place is. Looks like he hasn't clean the floors in week and all the grease on the back wall by the grill.. Gross. Eggs were served runny and the one had blood in it. Can't believe its a four star. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"We keep coming back here, great food, friendly staff, nice place.   Portions are big, really big. But so is the quality.   Seems to be family run, as the people really care that you enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Although the food (omelet, peameal bacon) tasted good, it was greasy diner fare. The pancakes were large, moist and fluffy.   What earns this place such a low score are its slow and absent service, and total lack of cleanliness and upkeep. Our table was wobbly and taped up. The floor was dirty, sticky and riddled with other patrons' crumbs. The entrance door was left open, which resulted in flies coming in and out throughout our stay. The kitchen (open concept) looked grimy and messy.  The waitress/hostess also walked in and out of the restaurant, leaving us to wonder if our food was going to come out.   I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place is under new owners so it is not the same restaurant everyone has been praising in previous posts. The restaurant is actually called New Old village bistro because it has new owners now.  The food is mediocre at best. My omelette was pretty tasteless and the fries were super greasy and way over salted. The prices have also gone up because the website for this place is actually the old restaurant's webpage with their old prices from before which seemed like a much better deal. Also the online ordering doesn't work even though it says your order was placed online. The new owners didn't even have a clue there was an online ordering system.   The service was also super slow. Took 30 minutes for my takeout order which is ridiculous for an omelette.  Overall I would suggest going elsewhere for your breakfast fare or stick to cora's which is much nicer, healthier and has AC."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever going to this restaurant and especially going out for breakfast.   I have to say that the service met my expectation even though it was busy around noon ish. The wait time for the food was average, again based on the number of patrons. Quality of food was pretty tasty. I had the veggie breakfast burrito and the Texas style toast.   It was a bit \"small\" inside, but it did not bother me at all. One thing is for sure, you'd have to wait on a busy day, but its not much of a long wait.   I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great service and huge portions! It's a small dinner and the chef was also our server on a Sunday 1 hr before it closes.  The omelette is a 6 egg omelette which was huge and delicious with a lot of options! And their pancakes are fluffy and delicious. Reasonably price and delicious"}
{"text":"The place has a bit of a rustic feel, but the food is pretty good at a cheap price point. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. It doesn't seem to be very busy most of the time which is also great."}
{"text":"Read up online about this place and decided to try it myself. The food was excellent for the price. Bacon was crunchy, potatoes were on point. Staff really friendly overall would come back for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Food looked really good on the table of other's, huge portions, except ours never made it to our table...Went in on a Sunday afternoon with not much rush, placed an order right away and waited about 55 minutes with absolutely no idea where our order was and the single staff server saying it was coming in 2 minutes or completely avoiding eye contact. Paid for our coffees and left an hour later, table in front of us also had left without their food. Ridiculous customer service with no apology in the end."}
{"text":"I would not come back here even if you paid me to. But if you want to wait 30-40 mins just for breakfast food then be my guest. The restaurant itself looked pretty dirty and the washroom had dead bugs by the window like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time. Most of the people that were also there looked very annoyed that the food was taking so long. When it actually came it was just \"meh\". Don't know why it has high ratings."}
{"text":"Great little place! The food was amazing -  their omlettes are massive.  You get a lot for a reasonable amount.  Their pancakes are cinnamon-y and absolutely delicious. Can easily share a meal and still be full."}
{"text":"This place is really bad. The only thing good about it is the poutine, however the way they make it is really gross. They don't even wash their hands before making something; like you should at least wear gloves.  I once paid for a poutine which is 6 dollars, i paid them 20 dollars and they give me 8 dollars back, like can you guys do simple math?  They take so long to make the food and their service is horrible.   ALSO they don't even have garbage cans to throw stuff out. And their washroom look like it was not renovated. Lastly they keep bribing us to come back for business. An example of that would be like \"one dollar milkshakes this Friday, come and we will give you\".  They also keep asking us why aren't the kids from school coming to their restaurant anymore because everyone does not come here anymore Also there is dirty stuff all over the forks, cups, tissues and etc.  No air conditioning and plus the doors always open so bugs keep coming in. And they increase their price because know one wants to come because their unsanitary. They touch money with their dirty hands and their attitude is not welcoming.  Plus on their website (oldevillagebistro.com/about-us.php) they say that \"oldevillage bistro has been in business for over 20 years which i respect however it is not true that \"we prepare our food with care each time.\" Also they say that 96% of our customers are returning customers."}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait time for a breakfast / brunch place. Too many skip the dish or uber eats deliveries that the cook focuses on before dine in orders. One delivery guy came for two separate deliveries and still no food on the table. Had to ask for coffee to be filled 30 minutes after ordering. Food finally arrived 50 minutes after ordering (omelette and benedict). Food was good but totally turned off by how long it took to come. Maybe plan to order delivery next time."}
{"text":"Food is yummy but wait is forever for the food. We ordered the omelette with pancake and fruit combo. Pancake and fruits never came but our bill did. The server ask if we wanted something."}
{"text":"I'd rate Olde Village 2 stars only because the owners are quite nice.  First thing you notice when walking into this tiny shop is that this place needs a reno, stat.  You know when hipsters purposely find a hole-in-the-wall place and carry mismatched, vintage plates across well-worn, old-skool wooden or laminate floors?  Yeah, this ain't that.  This is genuine article, just plain old. No A/C, floors look sticky, wall paint is peeling.   Don't ever use the bathroom if you're of delicate sensibilities.  The eggs benedicts are very so-so. The kitchen is cordoned off by a high divider, so I can't say this for sure, but I'm pretty sure the hollandaise is not house-made.  It tastes like hollandaise made of margarine.  On the plus side, they are very generous and will add extra on top if you ask for it.  On the down side, you will soon realize you really don't want it.  Eggs are poached OK.  Solid but not rubbery whites, runny yolk on the inside.  I'm not a fan of peameal bacon, and this one had a very strong porky smell - I guess great if you like peameal, not so great if you don't.  Also ordered a stack of 3 chocolate chip pancakes.   Not bad, just regular ol' pancakes that taste like they're made from a box mix...  I really struggled about posting this because I wish success for the kindly owners.  It would be great to have a locally owned breakfast spot in Markham.  As a customer, here are the changes I'd hope for: - Renovation!  The run-down look is not only uncomfortable, it's hard to keep clean.  A large ant ran across my table at one point.  It was just an ant, so I kept it to myself and discretely smushed it.  The sticky floors, walls, tables (pretty much sticky everything); the unfinished bathroom; the thick/hot, humid air... - Source another hollandaise made of actual butter.  Best would be house-made hollandaise.  It takes a lot of egg yolks, but if you invest in the eggs you can use the egg whites for... - House-made pancakes, if they're not already, are super easy and inexpensive to make.  The pancakes I had were a little dense on texture.  There are a few techniques to make pancakes fluffy, including whipping the egg whites for the batter.  And that's the end of my review!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast!... Reasonably priced, great food and lots of it!  lol  I'm on a road trip right now from Vancouver to Markham and I'm just on the rod again from Swift Current, Saskatchewan!....  I'm drooling for their breakfast  and the 2 people that work there are very hospitable and have a great sense of humour that makes the eating extravaganza that much better!...  They will remember me as the old insane long distance walker always wearing my bright yellow high visibility coat!  lol  Joe Magdall...."}
{"text":"real hearty and tasty breakfast. we biked there Saturday morning and i tried the crab-cake with Egg Benedict breakfast and wow.... that was one gooood eatin'. my son had the usual egg / back bacon breakfast. the place is very humble and small. they may have 4 or 5 tables total. however, that makes the attention personal. It's a little diner for local people. ah... I'm getting hungry!"}
{"text":"It's  the perfect family run breakfast joint in markham - huge portions.  Don't judge a book by its covers though, it's not fancy schmancy inside :)"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. From the outside it may look a bit run down but the food and service was incredible here, not to mention the value.  Came here for lunch with 2 friends, we had the sandwich and soup special, omelette with home fries and toast and a waffle and eggs breakfast.  The portions for all of them were huge, literally struggled to finish it. The cream of brocolli soup was very rich and I liked how there was an ample amount of stringy cheese in it. The omlette and chicken parm sandwich were delicious as well.  I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Overall I would actually give this place three stars because the venue could definitely use some redecorating however i didn't want that to affect how you rate the food. Because the food is really good. It's not gourmet but its those shops in the corner where its traditional breakfast and it tastes homemade.The really hearty meals y'know?"}
{"text":"Alright so we (group of 6) were planning to visit this little mom n pop place. Family suggested this place and they heard that the food was good. Note that this was Mothers day.   We walked in and the 4 of us who had arrived were seated. However since we were waiting for two others we knew we should move tables so that we were not obstructing the doorway.   No problemo. After seating we were promptly handed menus and we asked for some waters.   15 minutes later our non-obstructive table was cleared up and our group was moved and seated. We placed our orders and waited. At this point we had no waters yet..  We waited a good 45 minutes for our food. Nothing. No waters. We asked for waters again at the end. The lady responded and went back into the kitchen. We saw her run outside texting instead of getting our waters. That was the last straw.  We walked out. I'm sure the food is great and all but this is ridiculous. Don't know why there was only one waitress on a Mothers' day.   The two other groups of people that we saw in the restaurant looked very upset as well. At least they got some sort of sustenance!  Prices looked reasonable but I wouldn't pay for air."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant if you are in the mood for a delicious brunch, ample portions, and don't mind the \"greasy spoon\" feel of the place.   The service was consistently warm and prompt. The portions are so large that in the future I will most certainly share a meal.   The hollandaise sauce is some of the best I have ever had and when I asked for a side of hollandaise they brought a large bowl full and only charged about $1-2 for it.   We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food was decent ~ shared the big breakfast with my bf and it stuffed us both still leaving half a pancake and some eggs left over (very big portion so definetly if you are not a big eater I recommend you to share this)  The place looks a little old but  has a cozy feeling.  We went around 11;30am and it was practically empty.  With that being said the service  was slow.......  And by the time I finished my first round of breakfast finally came the pancakes&French toaat...  Also they just handed us the bill when we didn't even finish our food yet.    The total of the breakfast came to $17+tax  IMO not quite worth it I rather grab some pho for that price or If I was up for breakfast I would just go to wimpys diner at steeles and donmills which has way better service/food and way cheaper if you go for the early bird !!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating breakfast and love to try different breakfast place/diner around the neighbourhood. My husband decided to bring me to this breakfast place.  When I first walked in, I noticed the restaurant looked old-fashioned, but everything was very clean and tidy. The owners were very nice and sincere.  We ordered a village big breakfast (with 3 eggs,  2 bacon,  sausage,  ham,  1 buttermilk pancake,  2 rye toasts and 1 French toast) and a fish and chips. We were expecting for a small portion since the price was lower than other breakfast places.  When we saw the dishes,  we were so surprised the portion size was very big and the food was so fresh and tasty.  Our favorites were definitely the pancakes and the fish.  The buttermilk pancake was crispy on the outside and very fluffy inside. The hint of cinnamon powder on top add an extra layer of texture to the pancakes. The chef pan fried the pancakes into bear shape.  I am sure all girls and kids will love the look of their pancakes.  The fish were made of haddock and the fish batter is light,  crunchy and not oily at all.  We couldn't finish everything and packed 2 boxes to go!  Glad that we discovered this hidden gem and will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fluffy french toast - completely delicious on its own without syrup. Freshly brewed coffee and soft buttermilk pancake. Very tasty cheddar cheese omelette with fresh veggies! Nice friendly service despite that we arrived near closing hour. Do not be fooled by the underwhelming decor and size - food is fresh and delicious and I would choose this place over Cora's on any day!"}
{"text":"Never noticed this place till I saw it on yelp. It's a small family owned restaurant, very nice and friendly owner. I ordered the big breakfast and it came with a very big portion, probably enough for 2 people. The potatoes were delicious!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this gem completely by accident after visiting the tile shop next door and getting really hungry.  Truthfully, this place doesn't look like much at all inside or out so I wasn't expecting much  However, the couple running this place are very warm and hospitable.  Add to this the $6.99 for a lunch combo (chicken parm sandwich with a salad and pop that day) that was simply MASSIVE and actually tasted really good, and you've got the perfect combo for repeat customers.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I would STAY AWAY from this place unless you want to run to the bathroom 10 times a day. My friend and I came here based on seeing only a few pictures but when we got there we almost decided to go somewhere else. But since we didn't have enough time, we settled for this place. First of all, the environment is atrocious, it's a small family (Indian I assume) owned restaurant. The health standards looked pretty questionable. But we thought it deserve the benefit of the doubt since the food pictures looked alright. Wrong again, the steak felt extremely dry and the flavor was horrible. The eggs Benedict wasn't very good either, I'd say a 5/10. Most importantly, my friend and I didn't feel good the whole day afterwards, if you know what I mean. The service is also extremely slow, since the owner doubles as the cook and waiter."}
{"text":"Probably driven by along hwy 7 a million times and never noticed it.  But boy am I ever happy for yelp or I would have never found it! Very small family owned restaurant - probably only a handful of tables with an unimpressive decor outside and in.  The food portions however are ginormous and great value for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised.    My friend I both ordered the olde village big breakfast with 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of ham, potatoes, toast, pancake, French toast and a piece of fruit with coffee for $10.99!  One big platter with the eggs, meat, potatoes and toast came first.  We were already shocked by the food portion we completely forgot about the second giant plate that came with the pancake and French toast sprinkled with lots of cinnamon.  We obviously couldn't finish our food.  We are two little Asian girls that have a big appetite but this was definitely out of our league.  The owner was very friendly and came out to see if we enjoyed the food and encouraged us to pack it to go.     Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tiny, but casual location for breakfast/brunch! While the interior and exterior are quite unimpressive in aesthetic, the food does in fact compensate. The cooks and wait staff are friendly and are quick to serve and ensure the meal is going well. I typically get the Village Bistro Breakfast; three eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, toast, and french toast. The portions are quite generous, with more than expected for breakfast portions. The french toast is by far my favourite; super fluffy, and more so on the sweet side. The pancakes are also fluffy and come in powdered sugar. Beyond the breakfast selection, they serve some excellent lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place. Food was delicious and very inexpensive. The decor is old and a bit tatty ,but it fits with the old school vibe of the restaurant. As others have mentioned, have patience as it's a small family run restaurant. We will definately go again!"}
{"text":"This isn't a fancy joint. It's small. Now onto the positive comments... The service was decent considering every time I went there was only 1 lady waitressing and 1-2 guys in the kitchen. The food was delicious! This is my favourite place to get roasted potatoes/hash for breakfast. They add so much flavour to them! They also have low prices and lots of food. We never finish our breakfast but we pay $10 on average. They also have cute bear pancakes. Yup, bear. Go and check them out."}
{"text":"The storefront doesn't exactly beg a double take, nor its interior. It's underwhelming, offsetting even; I had to remind my eyes not to wander too far. Everything about it is olde. But like many reviewers have said, you can't judge a book by its cover.   Huge portions and cheap cheap prices are the value of coming here. Despite the look of this place, their food is good, so don't correlate it with their décor. It took me a very long time to finish my breakfast combo solo, accompanied by CP24. In fact it took me so long that I forgot about the steaming gigantic eye-opening pancakes that were included at the end! Seriously it was a very pleasant surprise, like a sugar-coated gift, and sadly I could not finish them!  It's a slow, quiet place. Like I said, probably not many people bother to give it an eye. Of the few people that came in, it was for pickup. One of their better qualities is their 6am opening time. Yes it's in dire need of renovation and it's pretty much a one-man show here. And yes, I know there are more decent places to breakfast & brunch in Unionville, but if you can overlook these things and are simply looking for something to eat, give this place a try, it'll totally be worth your visit if you're super hungry for classic breakfast."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and their signs advertising ridiculously cheap food finally pulled me in. What can I say? I'm a sucker for good deals.   We got the big village breakfast that came with 2 sausages, 2 pieces of ham, 2 pieces of bacon, 3 eggs, hash browns, toast, French toast, and a giant slab of pancake, as well as the hot and honey chicken wrap with fries.   The big village breakfast could very well feed a village. Portions were massive! Bacon was crispy, eggs were cooked properly, and the toast was nicely toasted and buttered. The chef later on told us that he smokes the bacon himself. This is a typical breakfast you would get anywhere else, but their pancakes were nice and fluffy and their french toast was really good, too.   The hot and honey chicken wrap was also a huge portion. I was forewarned that the wrap would be spicy and I appreciated the clarification. The wrap itself is a little juicier than I would have liked, but I was only able to finish half, so I'm going to throw the other half in the oven for dinner later and I'm sure that will solve the problem. Filled to the brim with chicken, tomato, and onion, this meal is really two in one. Fries were standard. I know frozen fries when I see them.   The chef is also the server and he was very welcoming, making sure we enjoyed his food. For breakfast, food took a little longer than usual, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"In Scotland We call these places \"greasy spoons\"   In a greasy spoon you get cheap food and friendly service, you ask don't expect the tables and chairs to be modern and the decor to look quite worn   This place ticks the box of worn, tables and general decor is greasy spoon looking   In a greasy spoon .... Even tho it's worn.... It's clean..... This place is filthy .... I'm surprised how the Canadian food agency allows this place to serve food   On entering I sat down and my partner ordered a coffee .... I went to ask for tea and off the guy went without even looking in my direction...... 10 mins passed, no coffee and not even ordered yet.... Called him over .... Ordered and asked for My tea.... Reminded him of the coffee   I moved my arm at this point and realised it was stuck to the table!   Now ... Greasy spoon.... Cheap food ..... Well this place isn't, I've been in much nicer establishments and paid less money than their menu is charging   My food came ..... They added ingredient not on the menu ...... The home fries came with onions ......I hate onions and if this was advertised I'd have said not to put the onions in   They took it away to replace the home fries easily enough   I expected a larger portion too.... It's a greasy spoon and not cheap so where is the large helping  Then we found ants crawling around our table .... Pointed out to the server who shrugged smiled and left never to return   Well buddy I'll never return either   Crap portions Crap service  Crap hygiene  Crap prices   Crap crap crap"}
{"text":"First off, let me just start by saying: This place BADLY needs renovations...  I regret the moment I sat at the table, and I saw one waitress struggling to clean tables, and you clearly see impatient customers getting pissed because of long wait times.   There are wait times to be seated due to limited tables, and the place doesn't look clean at all. The tables were sticky! The whole time I was sitting there was maybe a hornet or a really really big wasp which was flying around the window.  The only waitress took a long time to get our order, the food took a long time to arrive, and really everything just took too long in this place, I felt like it ruined my morning. One poor waitress answering all calls, refilling drinks, taking orders, delivering orders, cleaning tables, seating people, etc. Please hire more servers...!  Only plus side is their portion size, which I believe everyone can agree, are huge!  I regret not going to my usual breakfast place and trying Olde Village Bistro for a change.. Definitely not coming back, until they improve in service or at least expand."}
{"text":"Good traditional breakfast place. Very small with minimal tables and only one person cooking, so if you're in a rush, this might not be for you. They have a big breakfast option with little bit of everything for you to try (eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, toast, potatoes, pancake, and french toast). Everything is good, but nothing too outstanding. There is also no air conditioning, which made it a bit stuffy. The decor is also traditional and old. Would consider going back to try other items on the menu, like their lunch items."}
{"text":"Flies are anywhere...food is pretty salty , not as delicious as others said it.  won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"This was our go-to breakfast restaurant on the weekend but no more.  They need to get their kitchen in order - it takes too long to get food!!!  The cook obviously doesn't know how to multitask as he makes one table order at a time.  Breakfast is good but I give a pass on the burgers.  The meat tastes sour - yuk!!   The floor is greasy and exposed electrical outlet coming out of the floor - need a visit from Dine Safe Markham perhaps?"}
{"text":"I agree with what Michael L. said below - \"Don't judge a book by its cover\".  The place may look outdated and rough but it's cozy, friendly, and delicious.   This restaurant covers a wide variety of food, mainly diner food varieties, but also pasta and stirfry. The Olde Village Bistro has all-day breakfast and that's what my friend and I came for. We walked in around 12:30pm on a weekday and the place was full and busy. It's a small store but we were able to get seats. With the business they have, hopefully they'll expand someday.   I ordered Eggs Benedict with a side of potatoes while my friend ordered a Western Omelette with potatoes and a pancake on the side. We had to wait a while - maybe around 20 minutes - but it was worth it.  The other reviews are right when they say that the portions here are huge!    The food is also really good - the omelette was delicious and the eggs benedict was pretty good - lots of hollandaise sauce though. We loved their side potatoes and the pancake was cooked to that golden yellow perfection, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinammon with syrup on the side. We'd definitely go here again - great value,  friendly staff, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow place. We had to wait 50 minutes for our food. Had to keep asking for coffee & water refills. Understaffed & overwhelmed- this seems to be the motto in many Canadian restaurants. Keep waiting a LONG time for food. Some patrons waited & left. The food was good & they were nice enough to offer everything on the house but we insisted & paid. They said they were overwhelmed with take out orders. My only complaint is that they should not accept so many take out orders or so many dine in patrons. The restaurant decor needs to be updated - we expected an old village bistro kinda place.  The bathrooms were clean. The place was crowded and people wait a long time to be seated. For a long term success of the place, they need yo make changes. The owners are nice & it willbe good to have a locally owned breakfast/brunch place nearby."}
{"text":"Terrible food. It's dirty and oily. And the speed is so slow. We wait for 1 hour to have the food ready. So hot inside. No air conditioner."}
{"text":"I travel all the way from Scarborough just for this resturant. The food is amazing and the portions are huge. The Mexican omelette is my favourite dish; the omelette is huuuuuge and they have the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. And it even comes with a massive pancake, all for about $12. The one thing better than their food is their customer service. The owners are so friendly. The resturant is run by a couple. My first time walking into the resturant, the chef greeted me like he knew me his entire life. The server, his wife, spent about 5 minutes getting to know me, which was so sweet. The food is amazing and the customer service is amazing. It's definitely worth the wait. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Maybe I hit this place on an off day. After reading the reviews here, I decided to try it.   The staff were great. The food was fine, but nothing fantastic.   It was cramped for seating.   The flies buzzing around were annoying.   I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"EASILY my favorite breakfast place! Anytime I have a chance to, I come here-- *Highly* recommend their Eggs Benedict with Steak!"}
{"text":"There is no way this is a 5 or 4 stars place. I order a sausage and egg breakfast. The potatoes were soggy and the sausage was not well done. The waitress act friendly but I can tell she is just trying to be. I work with people everyday so I can tell who is sincere or not. The cook was actually friendly then her. I don't think I would come again."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan of this place. Firstly it took about 25 minutes to receive a 3 egg breakfast when it wasn't too busy.   Eggs were over cooked. Toast was Dempster quality sliced bread and the tomatoes were not very ripe.   The menu stated that it came with fruit but it didn't. We asked for it and she was surprised that we actually wanted it.   Eggs were small.   It's obvious to me that they cut a lot of corners. I wouldn't come back here. There are much better breakfast options in the area."}
{"text":"Came here again with some friends, wanted to try something else after being tricked into having the largest breakfast I've ever had. Ordered the special of the day, crab cake Benedict.  Food is a little slow to arrive, but everybody's meals come at once. The crab cake has quite a bit of filler but there is definitely crab in it. The Hollandaise sauce was good and  went well with the crab cakes. Added a coffee and the bill ended up being $20 for me. Not quite as good a deal as the big breakfast but still a lot for the money."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and I would say I prefer this to Eggsmart and Cora's.  Cons Place looks run down Tables are wobbly Not much seating  Pros Good food - greasy the way breakfast should be Big portions - enough to feed 2 Decent price - roughly same as Eggsmart and Cora's Friendly and family run - I think  So my friends don't really like this place cause everytime we have been we had to wait (which they hate) and during the warmer months they leave the door open so flies come in. Without AC in summer it can get hot in there  Probably need better ventilation, friends complained their clothes smelled like smoke after the meal but guess what - after our meal we step outside and have a smoke *eye roll*  Bottom line - Good food and huge portions for your $$$ If you're a little princess who can't stand waiting a few minutes to be seated and must have AC and someone serving you hand and foot then this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, friendly owners. If you want a no frills, rye toast, creamy scrambled eggs,  tasty homefries and crispy bacon, this is the place to go. Best time is 6 to 7am. After that, brace yourself for a wait, that is, if you don't mind smelling like sausage and bacon after, as the place is small and the ventilation is not the greatest."}
{"text":"hidden gem . really good omelets. fast on service and few tables. will come back again ."}
{"text":"Friendly service and the breakfast/lunch are ar a very good price for the portions they serve. I saw a review below saying they only have 2 tables... i counted 8. They have 8 tables lol."}
{"text":"It is true that the place need renovation but you can have a descent brunch there. It is a family owned bussiness and I always enjoy supporting these kind of bussinesses."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place in the GTA. Food is incredible and the portions are huge. It is always well worth the wait. I have truly never had a better tasting omelette, and their hash browns are like no other! The owner is very hands on, and very friendly. You must try this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon. The place was empty at first but then wave after wave of high school students came pouring in. It was like I was in a high school cafeteria and the noise level was so loud I wanted to just leave.   This joint is a bit run down and could really use an update. Small but cozy at the same time. I believe this is a husband and wife operation. They were both very friendly and easy to speak with. Their friendliness gave me a bit more confidence about the place.    Eggs Benedict with salmon $11.99 - comes the home fries which I really enjoyed. The home fries was basically a whole potato with the skin which was cut into small cubes. The egg itself was poached really well and the hollandaise sauce was pretty decent.   Big Breakfast $11.99 - 3 eggs, 3 meats (sausage, ham, bacon), home fries, buttered bread, huge fluffy pancake and French toast. It was so big that it comes in 2 separate plates. Everything tasted good. Bacon was extra crispy just the way I like them.    A good breakfast place but Honey B Hives is still hands down the best.   3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I'll give this 4 because the food is great, but everything else isn't really. I'd come back though! I came here with a friend who highly recommended this place.   Food: 4.5/5 - for what you are paying and the type of food you're expecting walking into here - this place exceeds my expectations. The portions are massive and I couldn't finish my food. The food was a bit oily and isn't exactly a healthy brunch choice, but if you are looking to beast it out one Sat/Sun morning, I highly recommend trying this place.   Service: 3.5/5 - Service was fine, the owner was friendly.  Atmosphere: 2/5 - The restaurant looks pretty run down and seems dirty. The furniture, lighting and setup are all in dire need of renovations."}
{"text":"This place is a bit dumpy, and the service was a bit sketchy. The waitress left for the day about 2/3 of the way through our brunch, so the cook had to take over, which was really kind of odd.  The food was good, though, although a bit on the salty side. I had Eggs Benedict, and it was a generous, 3-egg portion breakfast. Lee ordered a poutine and it was pretty good, also a very generous portion, with excellent fries and a lot of gravy.  Everything was a bit on the salty and greasy side, so this is a total greasy spoon for sure, but it was pretty good.  So basically -- food good, but the service brought down the experience a little bit."}
{"text":"Ultra disappointed. Very  poorly ventilated place.  There were just two tables, we waited  almost  40 minutes to be served with our food.  Please is not clean.  Doesn't matter what you tell them about your order,  they follow their same  script.  I ordered extra juice omelette,  said  about  EXTRA JUICY five  times. My omelette came  not only  totally  dry,  but  crumbled in  bit and  pieces,  and  even  the meat inside was totally overcooked.  I had to  really  dig in my with knife to cut through the omelette and really  chew through it.  I have  nerve  had to eat omelettes the  way.  I had also asked to  swap out the  toast and fries.  Server offered tomato slices instead and I agreed.  But  when my  food arrived,  it didn't come with any of that. When  asked about my sides,  she  said it should  come  with  fries and  roast,  to which  I reminded her of the  tomato slices. She  the asked if I wanted  tomato  slices instead.  Hello??!!!! Was I not  speaking  English?  I have up on the omelette,  gave it back,  and  asked for  a house salad instead,  to play safe.  The menu said the it had croutons,  blue cheese abs  stuff in it.  It came  with lettuce,  tomato chunks,  red pepper,  cucumber and  onions.  I give  up.  Not  going to ask for my blue cheese cos,  like  I said,  no  matter  what  you  say,  or what the menu  says,  they  follow their own  script.  The pancake didn't  come with butter,  was very dry,  and it had cinnamon powder on it!!  I was totally not happy with my order and  the served asked the  talked next to your vote they liked their food.  A d I agree with others here, that this place  badly needs a rent."}
{"text":"I've never actually been to Olde Village Bistro, but their uber eats is really good. The portions are huge (which makes the uber eats prices well worth it) and I can only assume it's even larger in person.   I love their hollandaise sauce and their selection of breakfast is amazing. They make really good egg benedicts and they come with 3 eggs instead of the 2 I'm usually used to. I really should visit it in person sometime."}
{"text":"Dirty and overpriced. Came here expecting good food for a good price based on reviews and info but was fairly disappointed. Only plus is their service was okay. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Get the jumbo breakfast. You won't regret it. I mean, your stomach might not contain all that it is, but your eyes will thank you for the full meal. The chef smokes his own bacon and man, it's good! I would give this place 4.5 stars but I don't have the option, so this will have to do. The -1 star is for the lackluster coffee. It needs cream, which is unfortunate as this place has better food than the nearby Milliken Restaurant, at least that's my opinion."}
{"text":"The long wait for the food was not worth it. My partner's meal came bits and pieces all separately instead of together - they even forgot the fruit until we reminded them. I couldn't finish my benny because the hollandaise was way too fatty. Though yummy for the first couple bites the heaviness of the meal ruins it. Potatoes nothing great about them. Same with pancakes. I wanted to like it - it's closeby and it seems to really support local businesses via their placemat ads. Unfortunately I cannot recommend them and would not go back. If you don't have over an hour to sit around for mediocre food then don't come here."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall!  Service was a little slow but portions are huge! The food is great."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to try this place. It is a small but nice location. The gentleman, who appears to be the only one on staff, greeted us and took our order all in a friendly manner. My wife and I ordered the big breakfast and french toast that we shared (I'm glad we did because it was big portions). Everything was delicious but the potatoes and pancake stood out. All this for a reasonable price. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Small breakfast and brunch spot on Highway 7 close to Unionville Main Street. The interior could use air conditioning and a full out renovation and there's limited seating on Sunday brunches. But don't judge a book by its cover!  The food though, is quite good. Everyone was quite pleased with the quality of the food. The eggs benedict had a thick and tasty hollandaise sauce, though the amount of potatoes was much less than the other dishes. The pasta primavera was also cooked quite well. The ham and cheese omelette was salty, but that's only because there was so much ham it felt like you were getting your money's worth, including all the toast and homefries.  Our meal took quite a while to come out, and the owners pro-actively offered to reduce our bill by a meal and a coffee. The owners (both!) did come out and apologize for our meals taking so long - they had a large group, and a worker didn't show up that Sunday.  The music they play doesn't really fit the name or theme of the restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Trully a hidden gem. Don't judge it on its appearance because its not all that, a little nook in a corner plaza, with very humble interior but the food and the owner are what makes this family owned joint.   Raj is so friendly and welcoming it felt like coming home with a bellowing Hello as you enter or going to your uncle's place if your used to very friendly family that loves people stopping by. We had the Village breakfast (10.99) and it was ENORMOUS! Dude, this thing came with three eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, hash (which was sooooo good), pancake, french toast and toast.   Definitely will be going back to try their pulled pork poutine."}
{"text":"This place has its hits and misses.   We came here after the recommendation of my friend who adores this place. A small little hole in the wall like restaurant with a homey feel. I admit I expected it to be a bit more well put together.   We took some time to decide what to get and the owners were so kind in giving us all we needed. They're such nice people! I ordered the Western Hash Brown Omelette with a Pancake while my friend the Fish & Chips.   The servings. are. Huge.   It was so good and I couldn't even finish the omelette let alone the pancake which I had to box for home.   My only issue is just the aesthetics as it looks beat up. Super affordable. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is simply the best breakfast/brunch I've ever had, blows places like Cora's and Fran's out of the water. The owner is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Your food will take awhile to reach your plate so be prepared for a longer wait than usual, but that's only because there's only one person working the entire diner and he definitely takes time to make sure everything comes out just right. Home fries are perfectly salted with just the right amount of crisp, eggs always come out just the way you want. This place is great for more than just breakfast though, the pastas, sandwiches and wraps are just as good.   And the portion sizes, oh man. This is the only restaurant I've been to where I haven't been able to finish all the food that comes with your meal.. Definitely a great place if you like delicious food, and you like a lot of it."}
{"text":"Upon entering you see a restaurant that desperately needs renovations. Furniture is beat up, decor is a mess and it's pretty dirty. Flies are on the wall and you can smell an odor... All signals to go somewhere else.  Seeing as there were decent reviews, we still decided to give this place a chance but we regret staying.  Food isn't cheap here, it came out to $22 for two people to have breakfast items. The taste was also less than mediocre. All having this strange taste probably from old oil.   The service was also nothing special. Our server just left mid seating with a loud \"OK Bye!\" and we were left to be served by the kitchen staff... The only other table at the restaurant was also equally confused lol.  I currently feel disgusting after eating here. I think my toilet is expecting me later."}
{"text":"I went here on an odd day, there were 3 tables including me. I ordered the omelette which came in huge! Problem is i can see a pool of dark grease in the bottom of my plate which turned me off. The homefries was delicious. Served was hospitable. Seems like chef n server owns the joint. A table behind me a single man ordered oe eggs but returned it a started a racket saying his eggs are over done and the chef said thats oe and had this big arguement that i didnt want to hear."}
{"text":"Last Saturday after my dental appointment, hubby and I want to find a place to have a big breakfast to start our day, so it's a good chance to try Olde Village Bistro.  We always passed by this little restaurant but didn't notice is a good place for breakfast/brunch until I searched on yelp.  A very small family run restaurant with about 8 tables.  Although it's outdated, but I love their food!  I ordered a peameal bacon benedict and hubby ordered a big breakfast with everything (sausage, bacon, ham, egg, pancake and french toast)  The portion is really big and I love their potato.  Usually I will ask server to switch my potato with something else but not this time, I'm so glad I didn't ask.  Their potato is so good that I can finished half of my portion.  Compared to my neighbourhood breakfast place, this one is alot better.  Love it!"}
{"text":"The lunch is great too. We usually come here for the breakfast but todays lunch was awesome. Banquet burger with crisp bacon. Club sandwhich had good feedback as well with fresh tomato and grilled chicken."}
{"text":"BEYOND full.   Had the big breakfast which let me tell you, emphasizes on BIG. Cones with sausage, ham, bacon, 3 eggs, hash browns, French toast and a pancake for $10.99. It's pretty ridiculous. So I would suggest share the plate and grab a side of something.  We also had the western burrito for $6.99 and it comes with hash browns. Massive size.   Both were very good, albeit greasy but what can you do, part of the experience!   The pancake is GINORMOUS. Like enough for two. Both the French toast and pancake come midway through your meal (so its still hot when you are ready to eat it). So if you think they forgot... They didn't! But if youre the type to eat your \"dessert\" first, make note to them so they can make it asap.   Went on a Monday at 10:30am and it was empty so lots of tables. However it took 30 min for our food to arrive. All good though cuz the food was worth it. And the price? RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"I chose this place to celebrate my birthday with my friends based on the reviews and the pictures and I can tell you that this place will be a place I definitely recommend if you are looking for good food and good value.  I had the Western hash omelette and it was very good.  The portions are enough for you to have it over two meals.  I don't have a very sensitive palette so can't tell you how it compares to other places but I can definitely assert that I was not disappointed and will definitely come back.   Note - this place may be a little dated in terms of its furniture but I think the friendly service and good value for money trump dated furniture."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some new breakfast places and decided to give this little restaurant a try. It's quite difficult to find parking during weekends, but it's usually emptier on weekdays. However, there is a street right behind the plaza for free parking!  This place is run by a couple and my friend and I  were greeted very nicely upon entrance. The restaurant itself appears quite old. Not the best place aesthetics wise.   Food wise, portions are absolutely HUGE. The menu is simple with all sorts of breakfast and lunch dishes that range from omelettes, sandwiches, eggs benedicts and much more!  I ordered the Western Hash Omelette with sausage. I was utterly shocked with the size. I have never in my life seen such a big omelette. They are very generous with ingredients and the dish was packed with sausage and cheese. It comes with a good portion of potatoes as well as your choice of toast. It also comes with an equally big pancake!  The village big breakfast comes with three eggs of your choice, bacon, sausage, potatoes and your choice of toast. It also comes with French toast and another giant pancake!  The food was delicious and was truly comfort food. Everything was made perfectly! The owners were also very kind and made sure we enjoyed everything. Prices are cheaper than Cora's but portions are way bigger!  My favorite has to be the pancakes. Big, fluffy and soft! It was honestly some of the best pancakes I have ever tasted and I will come back for sure! Definitely recommend this place but make sure that you are starving or bring a lot of friends!"}
{"text":"This place is located on a small plaza and looks like an older breakfast restaurant that would fit in a small town.   The food is great but it is definitely a fat and greasy meal. It has large portion sizes. My boyfriend and I ordered the big breakfast and I ordered the breakfast with eggs, potatoes and sausage.   The good - the pancakes and waffle are moist, huge and fluffy. It tasted delicious.  The bad - the service is really slow. There was only 1 person working so he was taking orders and cooking which was hard for the 5 tables he was trying to serve.   I would still recommend this place if you are looking for a Coras or Eggsmart alternative."}
{"text":"Fantastic little eatery beside the decaying Dominos pizza joint on hwy7 and Main Street.  Portions are gigantic and the attention to detail is fantastic.  The 5 of us came aren't exact lightweights in the art of devouring but Ye Olde Village Bistro almost knocked us out with their portions.  We ordered just about one of each type of omelette as it was said to come with pancakes. Big mistake, it was delicious but we had to claw and scratch to finish the food."}
{"text":"It's a super tiny non-descript all day breakfast grease joint. When you go in, you will be immediately enveloped by the smell of grease, as the kitchen is not separated from the dining area.  A lot of the people who eat there seem to be regulars who chat with the staff and read newspaper or watch the news while they eat.   My friend had a cheese omelette with homefries and I had the pancakes. It's not particularly cheap, at around $10 a dish. The proportions are HUGE. My pancakes were good, my friend's omelette was good, and the homefries were super duper delicious. Bottomless coffee for 1.90 each that were decent.  We were there chatting for over an hour and eventually was asked by the server to leave, claiming that we need to to vacate the seats for other people. There were no other people so i dont know why we overstayed our welcome. Oh well.   Overall, I like the place because of its feel. It's hard to find a mom n pop diner that serves legitimate western breakfast these days that's not a chain like Denny's. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"After seeing the amazing Yelp reviews, I decided to stop by with my mom to try out their breakfast items. We went at 11:00am, the place was empty and didn't look too appealing. However, the owners were extremely friendly and attentive. I ordered the western hash omelet with a coffee, my mom ordered the big village breakfast. I must warn you their portions are HUGE! I finished only 1/3 of my meal. The food was so delicious, probably one of the best brunch joints I have been to. The only problem is the wait time can be a little long, but you have to take in consideration that their food is prepared fresh and on the spot. :)"}
{"text":"They have very good homefries because it's fried with onions.    Eggs benedict had thick generous slices of peameal bacon, but they had too much hollandaise sauce on top of the eggs, and if the sauce is made of margarine, it's basically 5 tablespoons of margarine slathered on your meal.  The bacon was fried well, but overall I think this greasy spoon was too greasy for my stomach, otherwise, everything tasted good and the service was excellent, the bathrooms were very clean, and the tables/chairs were also very clean."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times now, and it's overall pretty good. There's not many of these kids of brunchy places up here in Markham so I'm glad I found it!! Food tastes great, portions are HUUUGE and service is friendly. However, not the best idea to go in the summer because there's no air conditioning. It get EXTREMELY hot and unpleasant to eat:( Also, not the best idea to go if you are IN A RUSH!! Food kind of takes forever...even when it doesn't look busy in there. But overall, I like the place and would definitely go back!!:)"}
{"text":"My love for this place had a full 180 degree turn.  One Monday afternoon, my boyfriend was craving some cheap breakie food so we wanted to come back from the amazing experience we had last. The menu Is extensive and they had a huge variety from sandwiches, soup, breakfast , pasta...  At least that's what I thought...  Me:\"may I please have an order of the fish and chips\" Lady :\"ok...no problem\"... She then walks into the kitchen and came back out.. \"Sorry. No fish and chips today.. Only Friday and Sundays.\" Me:\" ok.. Then can I please get a burger.. Make my fries a poutine please !\" Lady:\" we don't have cheese curds\" Me :\" I'm fine with marble cheese\" Lady:\"we don't carry that either. Just cheddar cheese. \" Me :\" ok that's fine\" Lady : comes back in a few minutes \"sorry we don't have burgers today.\" Me:... \"So.. What do you have?\" Lady : \"just wraps , sandwiches , and breakfast \" Me: \" ok... I'll have the steak sandwich done rare please... With a ceasar salad. Lady :\"no ceasar salad\" Me :\"ok then. Just boring plain fries.\"  After 20 minutes do patiently waiting, my food finally came out. Steak cold. But at least my fries were warm... But we I indulge in my cold steak. Found a little hairy surprise.   I am utterly disgusted and irritated . I don't even need to rant here, you guys get the picture"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place at least a hundred times in my life not realizing its existence. WELL.. now i'm aware, and I'll be returning. I discovered it through the strong Yelp reviews.  When we arrived, there was one parking space left in the small lot and there was a slight wait to get a table. This place ain't pretty.. and the wait to get food was quite long... but at the end of the day, this was all overshadowed by the quality of food and the portion sizes. We tried the village meal (or whatever it's called), the hash omelette, and the cream of potato leak soup. Everything was outstanding. The soup was freshly made and amazing. The hash omelette was something I've never had before... I'm typically a traditional breakfast kinda guy, but I would gladly add this to my list of go-to breakfasts. The potatoes were excellent, and pancakes/french toast were also great. We didn't realize we were ordering food so we took more than half of it home!  a few heads ups: - Bring cash, their debit machine is unreliable - Bring a huge appetite, because their portions are MASSIVE. - Expect a wait, because it's a tiny spot with not a lot of seats,but it is well, well worth the wait in my humble and well-informed opinion  I'm eating my leftovers right now for dinner... still good!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. I really liked their omelettes. Really friendly staff, and the wait time was average. The portions are good. The only thing was that I asked for Texas Toast on the side... I was asked if I wanted white, whole wheat, or rye... wait what? Okay, rye. I received rye (toasted?) with butter slathered on one side. Mind you, I am married to a Texan, but it doesn't take a Texan to tell you it isn't Texas toast.  I wasn't too worried about it and just ate it. The place was friendly and the prices were fair. The food was also good. But I do recommend that they take care of the Texas toast issue ;)"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab breakfast but not at the price point of alchemy across the street or Cora's. Accidentally drove past it bc it's easy to miss but upon arrival the owners greeted us warmly. Y'all the portions are huge!  Ordered: -big breakfast (12.99)       there was so much food it definitely could've fed two people  -daily special (6.99)      it was pasta and they let you choose which pasta you'd like from the list. We got the chicken one and there was a really generous portion of chicken  -English omelette      my head is the size of a very small country and this omelette was bigger than it.   Overall it was a great place with good food, and friendly people. Decor wise it's not the most beautiful but it has a homey feel which is what I like in breakfast places any way"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy coming here for weekend brunch. The latest visits we didn't have pleasant experiences for two reasons:  1)  Food was taking a REALLY long time to arrive.  2) This place does not have AC (which is fine as it's an old diner) but they should have extra fans running. It was so unbearably hot in there, I could not enjoy my meal.   Food took 20+min to arrive. I was too nauseous from the heat to eat then. Don't think I will be returning"}
{"text":"We live in Markham but just recently discovered this hidden gem. Food tastes delicious, owners are friendly and actually make conservation with you! We brought our two boys here and everyone loved the food. Great value, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"30 mins for our food to come out. We ordered one meal to split. Which makes it even worse. Having only one cook running the entire kitchen by himself is probably what contributed to this.   However; that being said when the food finally arrived they totally redeemed themselves. The golden potatoes tasted amazing; the pancake was bigger than the plate it came on; bacon was fresh and delicious. Everything on my plate was good; minus the sausage. I wasn't a big fan.   All in all this place is a solid 3 stars. Very friendly service with a cook who clearly takes pride in his food and service."}
