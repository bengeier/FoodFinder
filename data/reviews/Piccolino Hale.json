{"text":"Typical chain however, the food is to a very high standard. The Italian staff can sometimes be snooty......The outdoor area is very nice with outdoor heaters. I highly recommend the pasta with king prawns, chilli and courgette."}
{"text":"Visited on a couple of occasions recently with work colleagues. Once on a Thursday and once on a Sunday. I've been there 2 or 3 times before that over the last couple of years. The menu is extensive and supplemented by daily specials (except Sunday I think). The large range of fish dishes and unusual salads tends to catch my attention. Most recently I enjoyed the salad with beetroot, goats cheese and chicory (with a longish name beginning with b that I've forgotten). Then the prosciutto and rocket pizza which was excellent, followed by a good quality creamy apricot baked cheesecake. Food overall really quite good.  Whilst I want piccolino to get more stars for the food, they fall down on service and atmosphere. The staff seem disinterested and impatient. I do wonder what kind of atmosphere they are aiming to create. So whilst I'm sure I'll be back for a work meal, I wouldn't spend my hard earned cash there!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, Piccolino is a fantastic chain and have not had problems in the past, but i will NEVER be returning to the one in Hale!  Firstly, I know Hale is very upmarket and 'well-to-do' area and they have \"famous\" people dining in this establishment all the time, such as footballers, their WAGS and all the other soap stars and reality stars that no one cares about. This DOES NOT MEAN the staff should act like prima donna's!!  This leads me to the whole reason for writing this review THE STAFF.   I choose this restaurant to meet up with some old friends and have a light bite/drinks during the England heat wave, so naturally the outside tables were packed. We put our name down on a list and were told it shouldn't be too long to get a table!  I was greeted at the bar by the bartender who had a face like thunder. really abrupt not pleasant at all. He seemed frustrated that we were taking our time deciding what to drink......even though there was no one else waiting!   It was really quiet inside and he did not have a lot to do, the waitresses were much more busy, rushing outside all the time. We got a round in and sat ourselves down, first drinks went down fast and during the catch up no one had bothered to ask us if we wanted any more drinks, which I found strange as the barman had walked past several times. My friend stopped him and said 'same again' indicating to the round just had on the table' .....He came back with one pint, so we had to explain all our glasses were empty! IDIOT!  After the second round we were hungry, we still had not been asked for more drinks and I went to find the waitress....NO RECORD of us waiting for a table had been recorded! and no sign of the girl we checked in with! USELESS. We said we'll sit inside and took some menus for ourself!  After stopping the waiter for more drinks again, we spelt out what we wanted, 2 pints and a half lager shandy. SIMPLE, he brought a pint of larger shandy and we told him it wasn't what we ordered.....He got VERY aggressive and RUDE and said, we ordered a pint. I replied, well she's been drinking halfs all night and we all heard her order it! He was adamant we were wrong and walked off saying he served what we ordered, and without replacing the drink to a half! FIRSTLY what the F*** is it to him whether or not he changes the drink, its not like it will come off his paycheck!  We then had to walk upto the bar to order food from him! where the waitresses were, I don't know!   The food came, it was good, I did have a bit of stomach ache afterwards, which can't necessarily be linked to that. The garlic bread very nice also.  We chatted the night out and went to pay at the end, obviously we had to walk upto the bar to do so, as no attempt to serve us at our table all night.  The barman then outshone himself as a first class, arrogant, slimy p***k. He gave us a bill, we paid, then he realised he had missed something off the bill and gave us a new bill without even explaining anything to us. My friend ripped up the old one and he said 'aggressive tonight' I said \"what\" he went on to say how my friend was a very aggressive person and had anger issues. WHAT ON EARTH. Why? because we ripped up a false bill? WHAT A MORON we had been laughing out heads off all night at the table!....NEWSFLASH....You are in the customer service industry so I suggest you pull you finger out,  start earning your wage and STOP verbally abuse your clients.  I have no idea what we tipped him for, which we did! It felt like cafeteria service all night.  Also the last pint we had in there tasted really EGGY and I wouldn't have put anything past this greasy Italian barman, probably a drip tray pint!.  If the manager or PR for this restaurant/chain decides to actually read this review and act on it, the date we ate was Monday 22nd July.  Not happy, Not going back"}
