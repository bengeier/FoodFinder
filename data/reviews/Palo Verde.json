{"text":"Had a great fresh breakfast!  Great eggs and salsa on pepper jack quesadilla! They also have buffet which looked good. Service awesome and the boulders is a place you have to see."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great, dinner not worth it.  Go over to the Spotted Donkey instead."}
{"text":"The room is as noisy as a cafeteria and would resemble one if trays were provided.  There is not a stitch of material to deaden the sound.  The room is blue and circular.  This is the main dining room of a highly rated luxury resort and they don't even use table cloths.  The food was at best, adequate. A group that sat down at the next table left before ordering.     The only reason for giving it a 2nd star was the wait staff.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.   There are far better restaurants in the area from which to choose."}
{"text":"We live in the area and we're looking for a new breakfast destination on Sunday morning. This place is at the Boulders resort and is fabulous."}
{"text":"This restaurants gets an A for effort but totally flops otherwise. Service was subpar (our waiter was really nice though), the food was mediocre at best. Lamb was burnt to a crisp. The chicken taste like old rotisserie you'd get at Safeway. The beef filet was really good though. The air conditioning was off on a 111 degree day. We literally had sweat dripping down our faces. There was no music playing so it was an awkward hall of echoing conversations and clinking silverware. I think they need better trained staff, new management, and maybe a chef who puts a little love in the food. Need to get their act together to justify these Manhattan prices."}
{"text":"Food here is great!  Nice atmosphere and great service. Affordable for a Waldorf Astoria Resort."}
{"text":"Dinner last night suggests that Palo Verde is not ready for service.  As said before, the renovations left the room stark and noisy, so that hasn't been fixed yet.  Removing the banquettes, a bare floor and dome ceiling make the noise level on par with many Old Town Scottsdale restaurants, not something expected at The Boulders.    At the first evening seating there was no corn chowder starter available, so that suggests that it wasn't even prepared for service.  The second choice of prawns (two pieces) were nicely sweet, but the truffle tamale was lacking any indication that truffle was anywhere in it's creation.  The lamb loin, all agreed, had a nice rub and sear, but had way too much chew.  Desert's street corn gelato was nice, as was the fried cheese tweel, but the cake beneath it all was unfortunately dry.  The seared ahi on radish amuse was beautiful, but bland, however the chocolate \"wine flight\" truffles were very nice.  While the kitchen was not having a great night, the service was attentive and engaging.  Our waitress made what might have been a disappointing experience a bit nicer.  I appreciated that she did not sell the desert menu short, as may servers do, unfortunately the dry cake did not live up to the very nice description given.  It could be that the room and kitchen needs more time to work on the menu offerings, which is somewhat limited (Really, chicken is considered \"Air?\") upon it's recent reopening.  I would give it time."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I've ever had at what is purportedly a fine dining establishment. The first sign of problems was when the server brought my drink order, a beer, and set it before me with no glass. A few minutes later when I finally got her attention I asked if I could have a glass for the beer. She assured me she would bring one to the table. Ten minutes later I'm still waiting. Got her attention once more & she said \"someone is coming with it.\" A couple minutes later it arrived, but it was not the chilled glass I had hoped for. In the meantime my cold beer had warmed in the night air.  When the charred octopus appetizer was served my first reaction was that it was the leavings from another diner. The presentation was so sloppy! One bite of the appetizer left me wanting to spit it out. It was room temperature & tasted like it was leftover from the night before. Next I tried a bite of the chorizo that was part of the dish. Inedible! I removed it from my mouth with my napkin. It was cold, greasy & nasty. I complained to the server, explaining exactly what it was that made the dish so unappealing & so unappetizing. She said she would share my comments with the chef & remove the charge from my bill. For an entree, I decided that a safe bet would be the special of the night, brazini (fish) served with fingerling potatoes & broccolini. When the dish arrived, once again, there was a lack of attention to the presentation. The fingerling potatoes were tossed with a mixture of broadly cut and deeply browned onions & mushrooms, which had the appearance of a pile of yard dirt on the plate. The fish itself was dry and had little flavor, however, once I poured a little of the sauce (which I ordered on the side) it made the taste of the dry fish more palatable. The broccolini never made it to the plate. Disappointing.  The dessert was not much better. Although others in my party of 4 didn't seem to mind the over tartness of the peach crostata I found it to be too assertive. The rosemary ice cream was also inedible.  The last straw for me was when our check arrived I noticed a \"service charge\" of 20% had been added. I assumed that this was the gratuity but just below the amount due line was this : \"The above charges do not include a gratuity\" Then there was a line that said \"TIP___________. That was it for me. I will never again patronize this restaurant due to the not very good service, poor quality food, and the excessive service charge."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Boulders and ate here a few times, and every time is was great. It's part of the hotel, so it's a little pricey, but the service was great and the food good.   The chef likes to create a burger special every day, and the ancho spiced burger on the menu was great too. I'm not a big meat guy but did burgers every time here."}
{"text":"We were here two years ago before the renovation and I'm sorry to say that it has gotten worse. While it was certainly dated, prior to the renovation, the food and service were of good quality.  If you're hungry, go elsewhere.  The squash tortellini was served with minced, raw onion and was undersalted. The chicken thigh was served with the un-rendered fat under the skin. The breast of the chicken was served with crispy skin, but it lacked seasoning. Don't serve flabby skin, just get rid of it. The fingerling potatoes had no salt, and the spinach was drowned in oil."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable both from the Hostess and our very knowledgeable and gracious Server, David. Food was perfectly prepared. I had the Grouper special and fiancé had the Short Rib. The Wine List by the glass and bottle service was impressively extensive. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for Restaurant Week.  I had the clam chowder, bison steak, and huckleberry buttermilk pie.  The chowder was very good and creamy.  The bison steak serving was insanely small.  I was very disappointed that it was 4-5 small medallion sized pieces.  The bison meat was amazing.  So tasty and delicious.  The not so delicious part of the dish was the puréed corn stuff.  It was incredibly salty and did not go with the taste of the steak.  The meal would have been so much better if the bison had been paired with any kind of potatoes.  The huckleberry pie was amazing and the portion was perfect for one person.  The overall experience was very good.  The staff was nice and attentive.  Downside was that it is very expensive for what you get and it was difficult to find the location... There is no signage, and the google maps app does not plot the restaurant correctly.  It was fun because it was Restaurant Week, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here.   The service and ambiance were spectacular.  We had the octopus appetizer special which was rich in flavors and very unique.   The scallops and ribeye were likewise very flavorful. Highly recommend dining here and ask for the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Went to Palo Verde for the first time with some friends visiting from Chicago. We were looking for a new place and based on the menu we decided to give it a try. The overall ambiance is lacking. The artwork on the walls were some photos for sale of random places which seemed odd. Also, the vibe was pretty nonexistent as there were very few tables occupied.   Our server gave insights on the menu which we appreciated her honesty. However she didn't write down our order so we didn't get the octopus appetizer which we requested based on her recommendations. The scallops and filet were fine but overpriced for what we received. Three scallops seem pretty skimpy for the price. Service was slow. We had mentioned we needed to leave at a certain time and it took over an hour from the time we sat down to getting our entree  and we were not overly slow in ordering.  We didn't even mention the starter not coming because we needed to leave but I am nonot a fan of servers who think they can remember everything.  I will chose to take my $ somewhere else as the value definitely isn't here."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The grilled radicchio salad was good and I don't even like radicchio. The NY Strip was just ok. The squash agnolotti was very creamy and delicious. The cappuccino was very tiny for the size of the glass. The chocolate ball was really good and the presentation was really cool as well. The sweet potato Napoleon was a great twist on a regular Napoleon with marshmallows and meringue. Wouldn't rush back, but really liked the agnolotti and desserts."}
{"text":"Last night we dined here...disappointing does not even begin to describe our dining experience. We walked over from our casita about 1910pm and wanted a patio table. I would say the restaurant was mediocre busy but not what I would call slammed. There was a wedding party and the music from the reception was overwhelming to the lobby of this beautiful resort and this restaurant. It's a shame that such an an amazing resort doesn't have a venue away from the hotel guests and bar and restaurant guests to avoid all the noise from the wedding party. Hearing the blaring sound of The Macarena or The Electric Slide while having a nice dining experience isn't what one usually thinks of when in a resort of this caliber... that's more on the level of the Holiday Inn where the wedding and events take place where the general hotel guests are. We were told by the hostess, with the manager next her, that they would seat us in 'about 10 minutes'. Frances, the manager, told us how busy they were and all about this wedding party. I guess as someone who works in the service industry , I don't really understand when a manager tells his guests about the busy-ness of a place. Handle it, manager. Not to be an unsympathetic person, but this is an expensive resort that people don't generally come to so that they can leave in the search of food; people, like us, come here for tranquility. We stayed here when this resort was under the Waldorf Astoria brand and we can tell a lot has changed. At any rate, we went into the bar to have a glass of wine and even the bar, which is beautiful, was a mess. The manager was in and out and the bartender was all alone. Therefore, it was slow and it was no wonder there was spilled wine on two bar stools and spilled sugar? or some 'other white powder substance '??? all over the main coffee table that got acknowledged but NEVER wiped up! Not okay. At 2052pm, needless to say it had been WAY past our ten minute wait time. I thought better of dining at Palo Verde , as the same manager was also managing the bar... it was a mess and that spoke to me. We had such a great experience earlier at The Golf Club, we were going to go there instead , because clearly, we had been forgotten. We then noticed the Golf Club was closing in about 6 minutes and we would not make it for dinner. My husband had now approached the hostess and she admitted that she forgot about us . Wow. We were seated because again, we did not want to leave the resort. This was it! The Grill is closed for renovation .. what options did we have? As the night before , we had an awful experience at The Spotted Donkey, the resorts other dining option. I refused to go back. We now waited at our table for 25 minutes for ANYONE to even acknowledge us! Finally a waiter approached us and we advised him of our wait. He promised to return. Fifteen minutes later : no one. The manager appears. We have no wine order taken. My husband has no menu , but an extra wine list. I joked, 'THIS is not our night !' Guess what else? NO special left. My husband ordered the Porchetta, haha , the manager returns , THAT is gone too. My salad , the Butter Lettuces and Vinagrette was so salty , but I was over trying to make this right. My husband had the Asparagus Bisque , it was actually very good .. but so little was given for the cost. We both went with filets. How could they possibly mess up that? IT was good.. salty but good. The Bleu Cheese sauce , I felt would be too much so I had mine held and I'm glad I made that call. Again, salt salt and more salt. Dinner arrived and there are no napkins. My God. We have to flag someone down for that. Bread? Yeah, that too. The Chocolate Sphere was an amazing dessert ... one that was truly unique and very good . It's served as a ball of beautiful chocolate that encases two mousses .. and hot, dark chocolate is drizzled over the sphere and it disappears to the encased chocolate mousse and hazelnut mousse. I was impressed and glad my husband ordered it. In the end, the manager apologized for our 'rough start'. He comp'd the apps and our glasses of wine. This is the thing, we didn't come for this stay with an intent of getting anything for free, we came to take a break from the world and our busy lives in a very Zen like place. It's expensive and we both think the quality AND the level of service should match the resort and this just does not. Comp'd or not, this was a sad excuse for a 'upscale' dining experience. I hope it improves and maybe with new management when we return."}
{"text":"We were given a breakfast voucher for some issues we had with our first room. Honestly, we we had paid for this meal, the stars would be less. The hostess was sweet. The waitress took forever to greet us. She didn't write down our order (which was not complicated, it was just my husband, baby & me) but when she walked away from taking our order, my husband said \"the order will be messed up.\"  We ordered blue corn waffles, lox and bagel, 1 egg & bacon. Sure enough, 10 minutes later the waitress came back to confirm our order, which indeed she got confused.   The voucher said we get a free drink & coffee, she never asked what we wanted. She brought our food (which was correct) & then immediately after she brought the check & never came back again. No refills for water or ice tea. Never checked to see if we were ok. Nothing.  The food was fine, over priced. Like I said before, if we had paid for our meal, I'd give this place a lower rating.  The space is beautiful, echoy, but nice."}
{"text":"The food here was so fresh and well seasoned and delicious! I ordered the halibut and my mom had the crab pasta. My halibut was cooked perfectly. And I came on a pea purée with a fresh greens salad. The greens salad wasn't the traditional greens but and actual fresh mix of parsley and other micro greens with the thinnest sliced garlic. It was heaven. My moms pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was spicy in a good way where it warms you throats and doesn't burn your entire mouth. We also had an appetizer of their tomato salad. On top of that we had an amazing waitress Gina. She was so knowledgeable. The service was phenomenal. I cleared my entire plate and wished there was more.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Palo Verde for dinner this weekend and were extremely impressed with the food and the service. Most of the dinner crowd was outside (which is a gorgeous place to dine, with lovely views), but we chose a comfortable, quiet booth inside. We started with the celery root and sunchoke soup and beet salad, then had lamb ribs and gnocchi, and filet mignon and prime new York steak as our entrees. Wow! Each dish was creatively and perfectly prepared. Delicious!!! And, our server, Nicole, was so friendly and professional. She definitely knew what she was talking about. Also all drinks ordered from the bar were terrific. Great bartender, as well. Thanks Palo Verde!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during Restaurant Week because of their unique menu. We loved driving up the winding drive to get to the restaurant - the hotel grounds are beautiful. The restaurant inside was beautiful as well, although it seemed outdated. When we arrived, the dining room was empty. When we left, about an hour later, it was packed.   Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. We asked several questions about the menu and our waiter was able to answer every question.   For appetizers, I ordered the squash and smoked chili fritters and my husband ordered the corn and rock shrimp chowder. The fritters were amazing - they were a little spicy but they melted in my mouth. My husband loved his soup.   For my entrée, I ordered the chicken - it came with tumbleweed dumplings and a simple sauce. The chicken itself was extremely tender and flavorful. Normally, I wouldn't order a chicken dish, but the waiter talked it up and was right on the money. I would order it again. My husband ordered the bison bistro steak. The steak wasn't anything special. My husband kept stealing bites of my chicken, since he thought it was much better!   For dessert, I ordered the Cowboy S'mores. Oh. My. God. It was amazing. It was a dark chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, and toasted marshmallow in a mason jar. Then there was a cinnamon/graham cookie bar on the side for dipping. My husband ordered the huckleberry pie. It was huge and he was unable to finish it. Granted, I couldn't finish mine either, but I tried. It was that good.  Overall, we had a great experience. The food was amazing. The staff was friendly and attentive. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner at Palo Verde located within the main lodge at the Boulders. I reserved the wine room for my wife and I to celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. The restaurant was not busy so we basically had the entire place all to ourselves. We started with the gnocchi and charred octopus plates both were absolutely delicious, the sauce around the gnocchi and crispiness of the octopus were just perfect. For the main course I had the special a surf and turf, medium rare filet with a crispy skin sea bass. My wife had the handmade rock crab pasta which had a small spicy kick but was so good I ate my plate and half of hers. For dessert the staff honored us for our 1 year with a chocolate caved in mousse surrounded by small brownies. The food, service and overall atmosphere were just top notch, anyone that rates this establishment less than 5 stars has no idea what good food and service is about at Resort. Thank you so much for a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"While technically we didn't eat in the restaurant (we ate in the lounge), the food came from the same kitchen.  The salads were awesome but they lost a point on the dessert."}
{"text":"Esposa and I celebrated a late Valentine's Day dinner at Palo Verde at  Boulders Resort & Spa, for their \"Private Dining in Our Wine Room\".  We had the Wine Room to ourselves.  From beginning to end, it was a spectacular evening.  We enjoyed 5 amazing food courses each perfectly paired to a delicious wine.     Opener: California sparkling wine (Mumm Prestige NV).  - Course 1: Octopus.  Brined in coak-soaked secret potion. Super tender.  Very flavorful.  OMG.  BEST we've had ANYWHERE.  Paired with a delicious Monterey rosé (Chloe 2016). - Course 2:  Diver scallops with king crab and truffled risotto.  WTF?  Three of my wife's favorite things combined.  High five!  Paired with a crisp and bright French Chablis (William Fevre 2016), thankfully devoid of nasty oakiness; delicious. - Course 3:  Thrice cooked (roast, smoke, sear) lamb ribs with red peppers and a creamy sauce.  The meat truly (sorry millennials, but you've ruined the word \"literally\") fell off the bone.  By this point in the meal, I had tears in my eyes.  Paired with a silky smooth Paso Robles Grenache (Melée 2011). - Course 4: Akaushi steaks with Japanese mushrooms on a lovely starch base.  The meat was perfectly cooked and no knife was necessary! Paired with an Argentinian blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Bonarda (no I'd not heard of the latter before, either).  It was full bodied with solid but balanced tannins (Renacer Enamore 2014) - Course 5: A big ball of chocolate sin. 'nuf said.  Paired with a lovely ruby port.  With each course, the chef hand-delivered a beautifully-plated dish to us and explained the food and preparation.  The sommelier then followed with a description of the wine and how it paired with the food.  This trio was a well-oiled machine that pulled off a perfect evening for us.  We shared a laugh with all of them.  I think that maybe they had as much fun as us?  Want a special night with amazing food: look no further!"}
{"text":"Fabulous. Everything we had was great. I had a southwestern omelet that was out of this world. Service is great. If you are staying at the Boulders Resort, don't waste your time and money dinning off the property for breakfast -- this place has everybody beat."}
{"text":"This is the Boulders resort main restaurant. We arrived at the hotel as weary travelers both hungry and tired. The restaurant is beautiful. The service was friendly and excellent. The dinner was a wonderful surprise for the start of our vacation. The next morning we had breakfast on the beautiful outdoor patio and the rancho huevos was the best I ever had. Very happy to have a dining this good at the resort when often the inclination is to drive about to find a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their chilaquiles - each ingredient is delicious on its own, and combined they're heavenly! The room and patio are gorgeous, and the folks are lovely. Thank you, Boulders!"}
{"text":"Rating based on attempting to eat breakfast here on April 8, 2016.  Took a while to find someone to seat us at a table.  Restaurant was mostly empty with 2-3 personnel only working.  Lots of dirty tables not cleaned up.  Took a seat and was given menus.  10+ minutes go by with no action or acknowledgement by any of the staff.    We got up and went to Black Mountain Coffee Shop in Carefree and had a wonderful meal with fantastic service.  Thanks PV and Boulders for showing me that there are always alternatives!"}
{"text":"We are locals and we love to eat on The Boulders property. It is close and the scenery is spectacular. We always dine at the clubhouse restaurants or the bar. Really have never been disappointed. This evening we visited Palo Verde. We were there around 5:00 pm. We were greeted and sat by a very attentive hostess, Amanda.  The restaurant had only one other table of guest. It was really quite a while before we had a server and then a really long time until we were served a cocktail.  I ordered Asparagus Soup. It was delicious. My main course was less desirable. The Halibut was a very small portion. Flavor bland. Not a 40.00 dish. My husband ordered a filet. Very average. I ordered an iced tea. To my biggest disappointment of the night, I was served instant iced tea!! I was told by my server that it would take a while but he could fresh brew some. Our total bill was approx 160.00. Quite frankly we were not impressed at all. We will continue to dine at the other restaurants on property but will probably not give Palo Verde another thought."}
{"text":"Stopped at the bar for a drink and the two bartenders just looked at us and took no initiative to come to take our order. Finally after giving them the eye they made it over to ask if we were \"Just playing on our phones or did we want order\". We ordered 3 drinks 2 were quickly delivered but they forgot my son's wine. We waited five minutes before they realized they forgot the wine.  The service was really missing for this level of resort and you see it with others' posts."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place for breakfast in town, before it closed to remodel.   When it reopened it was more than disappointing. The menu had been changed from unique southwest inspired fare, were almost everything was delicious, to an uninspired menu of cheap breakfast foods that you can find at any breakfast restaurant.   The execution of the dishes is also poor. The waffles were dry and doughy and were not served with extra syrup, and the tortillas on the breakfast burrito looked store bought and were stale.   The loss of this gem is truly disappointing. Whoever took over as a chef here should look for a new profession."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. The food took forever to come out in an restaurant that had 4 tables. My son's mashed potatoes was iced cold with his filet. My strip was ok but for $48 for the steak it had 4 onion slices and two slices of peppers that's it. Won't go there or recommend to anyone it's a rip off!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here one evening while staying at the resort  and had no complaints.   I had the half ceasar as an appetizer wich was to my liking though i have had better in the past.   As an entree i had the doubleglazed baconwrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes and redwine/mushroom sauce. This was a really delicious meatloaf with soft and creamy mash and tasty sauce. I would definatly have this again if i ever go back.   The halfportion of coconut cake was about a fullsize for me as a scandinavian but a nice end to the meal.   Price was not cheap and not expensive but somewhere in between.   A bottle of wine started at about 30 $.  Service level was high!"}
