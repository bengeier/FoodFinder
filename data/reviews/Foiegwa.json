{"text":"Best meal we had in Montreal by far. Basically tripped over this place. We had a resi at Joe Beef's sister restaurant (Liverpool), were checking out the Atwater market and were staying around the corner and walked by Foiegwa a few times as a result. It's a v cool looking place and we decided to google/check it out and were really intrigued. Called for a resi and they said they couldn't give us a table for three but at 6-6:30 we could walk in. At 6:30 walked in and were offered seats in a bar area (WARNING: They will tell you half of the restaurant is kept open for walk-ins but it is 100% bar seats. Based on my horrible, shitastic, want to commit murder-suicide experience with Foxy, which is terrible for many other reasons, this might just be a French Canadian troglodyte norm, but regular people may be surprised, especially if there are two four tops that sit empty for three plus hours while you sit watching friends of the chef walk in and take shots . . .) Suffice it to say I was kind of irked when I walked in but the food (really solid escargot, grenouille and green salad and some of the best croque Monsieur and steak frites I've ever had (pretty big sample) and really great service really won me over. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Truffle spaghetti, cheeseburger, escargots and add truffle for everything! Cocktails are also a delight!"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for 6 days and 6 nights and we came here 3 times. We probably went through half the menu and everything was delicious. We sat at the bar 2 times and both the bartenders who served us were very friendly and gave great service. This place is open late and takes on a party atmosphere in the later hours so if your not into that go early.  Either way you're going to have a good time."}
{"text":"Nice dinner, cute decor, super nice staff! We had the egg mollet, simple dish, very well executed. The salad nicoise with their special touch, worked very well, bravo! Then we split a super juicy cheese burger. In my opinion the best in montreal!! Loved it!!!!Had a wonderful evening, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute trendy diner with lots of French influences. I really like the decor of the retro white subway tiles and the gold globe scones. Our server was very attentive to us.   I went with a friend and I had the beef tartare and the cheeseburger with fries.  I loved the beef tartare! It was one of the most delicious ones I've had in a while and it was a pretty generous portion for an appetizer. However they didn't serve it with bread only two thin wedges of fried eggplant. The burger was tasty but it comes with a plate with jus on it so my bottom bun got pretty soggy, aside from that it was great! The only reason why I couldn't give this review a 5 star was because the fries served with my burger were undercooked, limp, and pale string potato fries."}
{"text":"Tasty  food!!! Strongly recommend the pancake!!!! For the duck confit, it is around average loll"}
{"text":"Review for brunch: my friends and I got the eggs benedicts, omelette and french toast. None of them were particularly outstanding but they were all pretty good. The omelettes came with tomatoes and potatoes, but they were each one ingredient which I though was a but lacklustre. The place is certainly very cute, and was quite busy. I've heard good things about their dinner, maybe brunch is just not their strongest point."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this restaurant. My absolute favorite dishes were the foi grois brioche bun - small but ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The steak tartar was delicious but if you're not over 4 people I don't suggest getting the larger one, the small one will suffice. The frog legs were fun to eat and as I've never eaten frog before I am not a reputable source but I thought they were delicious; they were so tender. The onion soup was to die for. The burger with extra frois grois was good but the frois grois was chincy, they barely gave any; I wouldn't get it again, but hey, at least the fries were good! Lastly the truffle pasta was amazing, I highly suggest it + the service was superb... we'd ordered the fried chicken but 10 minutes in wanted to switch it for a burger and the sever told the kitchen and they stopped cooking the chicken and started with the burger. The food also came very quickly."}
{"text":"Food was good, the cheeseburger was so awesome. We had the spaghetti as well and it was really rich! For appys we had the tartare, the escargot, the terrine, and the marrow. All were good so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Lovely place for small groups! Ins styled decor and convenient location. Foods are a bit overrated I think. My egg Benedict was perfectly cooked and I loved their potatoes and dipping sauce, but the tart tastes weird and is definitely not worth the price. Cheeseburger was fair, maybe a little bit too greasy."}
{"text":"Just terrible service. Sorry. Food was okay but not worth it at all. Everyone's meal arrived well before mine and almost done eating when I finally got mine. Egg was overcooked on the tartare. Waited thirty minutes for our bill. A whole lot of hype for nothing."}
{"text":"Joli restaurant qui m'a fait penser à un bistro parisien, et dont le menu donne vraiment envie! Nous avions pris l'os à moelle et les cuisses de grenouilles en entrées suivi du cheeseburger extra foie gras et une mention spéciale pour le risotto et pétoncles, agrumes, crumble de Parmesan et caviar de truite un vrai délice  Je recommande."}
{"text":"So over rated. Don't know what the hype is all about. Foie gras was okay. Burger super duper greasy. Sea bass very soggy and bland, just blah. Mussels all shriveled up that you have to look real close to find the meat of the mussel.  We didn't finish any of the entrees."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  Everything is excellent from the service to the decor to the food and drinks.  We live up the street so we made this place our new place to go when we want to go out. Brunch or diner we've never been disapointed. We brought so many friends in, and they loved it too.  For us it is definitely the new hot spot of Montréal. Make reservation for diner because we arent the only one thinking so. Get ready to wait if you go for brunch at noon, and yes you will be turned down if your group is not complete - but this place is also so tiny its totally understandable.   Congrats  to the owners / managers for your outstanding work, your constant smile and a food quality that never change."}
{"text":"Brunch Review!  This place is a gorgeous brunch location and convenient place to meet your friends. I love the environment and they have a lot of seating for such a small space. I had the blueberry pancakes which were amazingly soft and my friend had their version of the croque madame which is a form of ham and cheese sandwich with egg. The portion sizes were fair and the service was friendly. I loved eating in the bright sunlight and enjoying a bit of the Atwater environment on my way to brunch! The cuisine is pretty standard for brunch and leans french. I would come back to try some of the other non-brunch food in the nice space.   Come for the pics and stay for more food!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a group of co-workers and the food and cocktails were fantastic! I had their burger and it was one of the best I've had in Montreal. The bun, toppings, sauce, and beef were amazing. Their fries are crispy, perfectly salted, and seem almost addictive.   The only issue was the service. The server forgot to bring an item for one of our party, and only brought out 1 small mayonnaise and 1 small ketchup even though 4 of us ordered fries. The waitstaff were nearly impossible to flag down - we tried to talk to them and even waved our arms as they walked by but they seemed obvious (and the restaurant was only half full). I suspect the poor service was due to the fact that the restaurant is so new and hopefully they'll improve after a few weeks.  I also want to note that the restaurant is beautifully designed. It feels very trendy but welcoming.  With a small tweak to the service standards, I think Foisgwa will do spectacularly well. I can see it quickly becoming a favorite lunch/dinner destination for me."}
{"text":"Food was soooooooooo good!!!! One of my favourite dishes was the spaghetti!!!!!! Great cocktails! Definitely coming back here and recommending the place to friends."}
{"text":"I'd have to say: 5 star all around! Ambiance, food, service, price, presentation, vibe!!! Just made another reservation!"}
{"text":"$20 for a plate of over cooked spaghetti topped with bits of dry truffle. Bone marrow is supposed to be served piping hot, not just warm. Baguette bread was stale."}
{"text":"If you're from the mtl area or simply visiting you must know we take brunch pretty seriously. You NEED to go brunch at this spot. Best pancakes in Montreal hands down plus the place is super cute and the staff super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Je peux dire que c'est l'un des restaurants que je préfère dans ce quartier. Il y a de la bonne ambiance, les plats sont bons et le service est bien.  J'ai bien aimé mes pancakes à la ricotta et aux bleuets! Le spaghetti vaut le détour!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to ge there ever since the Atwater cocktail club opened. The place was packed and we didn't have a reservation, but they managed to fit us in. Spaghetti w truffle butter was to die for! Cute decor, great cocktails, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is laid back with a hint of fancy. It's set up to look like a dinner but the lights are slightly dimmed to cater to dressy attire as well. I noticed the theme applies to the food also, they serve some simplistic food but with an \"oomph\". We ordered tartare, snails, the cheese burger and spaghetti.  Tartare- very good, if you like raw meat you can't go wrong.  Snail- never tried them before and for a first experience I would say they were seasoned appropriate for their texture and made them quite enjoyable.  Burger- we got it with extra foies gras. It's like a glorified cheese burger ... It had to be the most satisfying cheese burger I ever tasted. The foie gras adds to its fatty and greasy texture. Overall my favourite dish.  Spaghetti- loved the buttery/creamy texture. The egg added to its delicious multitude of flavours."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family who came down to visit! I love the concept of being able to add foie gras to any of their dishes. Their foie gras was really fresh. Their beef tartare is to DIE FOR! It's delicious and their small size is the perfect amount because if we had gotten the large we would have been way too overwhelmed. We also got the deep-fried frog legs which were pretty good as well. Their spaghetti with the egg is also a must try! It was really good especially if you break the egg yolk first and mix it with the rest of your spaghetti. The mussels in the red sauce were also quite delicious. I'm not a super huge fan of French food since I find it too heavy for my taste but you should definitely come here at least once in your life!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim last Saturday for date night on our quest to try as many new places in Montreal in 2017 and it was a great last minute decision!  We arrived around 9pm without a reservation and were quickly seated at a communal table as everything else was fully booked. Having read amazing reviews across the board we ordered the beef tartare and truffled green beans to start and the truffled spaghetti and beef bourguignon as the mains. To our (pleasant) surprise, the hostess remembered that we preferred to have our own table, and came to let us know that a cancellation had just come through which we really appreciated. After we moved to another table, the food started to come out. The appetizers were absolutely delicious, and the mains that shortly followed were equally yummy. Everything was PERFECT. Although it took quite some time for all the food to come out, you could tell that everything was made with love (as cheesy as that sounds) using great ingredients.  The only one small negative was that my cocktail (Scarlett something) wasn't really very good but this isn't a big enough negative to knock any stars off. 5 stars for excellent food!"}
{"text":"Foiegwa, une superbe aventure culinaire au pays du foie gras. Oui, je suis une adepte du foie gras...chez Foiegwa, il y a tout ce qu'il faut. J'ai sélectionné un hachis parmentier de foiegras et de canard, je m'en lèche encore les babines. Le petit hic c'est le service, bien que l'équipe soit très sympa...je les ai trouvés un peu agressif sur les commandes de boissons...le verre à peine terminer et hop il propose encore quelques choses à boire...bref ça c'est moins cool."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We went to Foiegwa shortly after it opened seduced that we were by the idea of eating foie gras again. I took the burger with extra foie gras while my girlfriend took the foie gras hachis parmentier. While my burger was decently good, the piece of foie gras was so small that I barely noticed it was there... But I was the lucky one because my girlfriend didn't notice it at all in her meal. So much for advertising it and paying extra for it. Not sure we will give them another chance especially with the small room with lots of noise."}
{"text":"I've come here twice already but the thing about their food is that, too much can be overwhelming. I've tried their chicken and waffle and the maple syrup overwrites all the other flavours. The egg Benedict is actually nice, I have tried the salmon Benedict and I would recommend that for breakfast. I tried the pancake too and loved it but I shared it with friends so I only had to have one pancake. I am not sure if I would love it the same if I had to eat all four pancakes. It's very greasy and unnervingly sweet. The staff is very friendly. Great ambience and super cute decor. A very Instagram friendly place. It's diner themed. The portions are HUGE !"}
{"text":"Went to this place twice.  The first time was for a dinner and we were a group of 3. All of their tables were reserved for 1 hour later so they asked us if it would be ok to get the table for only 1h. We did and as we waited for the food to arrive, the waiter said he made a mistake and the reservation was actually for right now. He squeezed us in a small table for 2 and we have to be very careful not to make the plates fall of our table since we ordered too much food.  However, they wanted to make up for their mistake and inconvenience and offered us free desserts on the house. Now that's what I call attentive service.   As the for the food, it's awesome. No other words needed. The black truffle spaghetti is so flavorful. It's prob my fave dish so far. The other dishes such as the bone marrow, escargot, salmon rillettes were also pretty good.   The second time we went was for brunch. The benedict egg with salmon was pretty decent, but the sauce was a bit too sweet.   Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Make sure you reserve before!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little restaurant, makes for instagram worthy pictures. I had their eggs Benedict with spinach and cream cheese. It was too salty for me, i should've ordered something else. Everything else except the eggs was good. They had really good pancakes. I also liked the service, very friendly."}
{"text":"This cute little diner is a great find for brunch. A friend and I checked it out after we kept seeing drool-worthy snaps all over Instagram. We were lucky enough to snag a seat just before the weekend rush. Service was very friendly and the vibe was leaning towards hipster (but unpretentious). I had the chicken and waffles - food was good, but I'd say you would mainly come here for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Vraiment une belle place pour dej !!! Les prix sont un peu haut mais les plats sont excellents! Je vous suggère d'ariver plus tôt, car il ya beaucoup de personnes et le resto est petit !   Le service etait très bien et j'ai beaucoup aimé l'ambiance :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night with friends for the 1st time for all 4 of us. Surprisingly it was pack considering it was a week night. The food was good but very heavy and greasy. The cheeseburger was ok but very greasy and overpriced for what it was. It was a good thing that we didn't order the foie gras on the side given that it was already very oily. The soggy fries that came with the burger was actually good but again very greasy. The fried chicken was juicy, the truffle spaghetti was good but very heavy. They put way too much cheese on top of the spaghetti.....it literally covered all the pasta. I think it's a place you would go once just to try, and not go back again given the food is very heavy and greasy."}
{"text":"Take me to a place that will flood my mind with old school days and bring a whirlwind of flavours to my palate...Foiegwa.  The location and decor for this venue were perfect- cozy, alluring with the right amount of seating that does not overcrowd you with noise. The menu was simple with an array of options for the non veg or veg. I tried a creamy, smooth chicken liver paté as an opener snack.  Followed by the Beef Tartare for a starter; truffle spaghetti, clams/mussels, ratatouille- all were light and shareable main dishes; ended with an apple crumble for dessert and a mind tripping orange soda Float  that took me back to school days.   I loved everything about this place- in my books next to Cadet. compliments to Gabrielle for the suggestions and Chefs Jeremie Falissard, Roberto Barroco & co. for your enchanting culinary skills."}
{"text":"We had dinner there and the environment was nice. I ordered their special which was a filet salmon with mushrooms and goat cheese. Didn't like the goat cheese but the flavor was very strong."}
{"text":"Very good food, the place is very nice as well.  I had the burger which is delicious and the fries are fresh cut. The Spaghetti is also very good with an egg on top The Beef Tartare was Amazing.  Prices are reasonable although parking is hard to find."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to see a show at the corona-theatre on a whim. Loved the decor and old school vibe inside - classy romantic diner feels. Anyway, got the fries and hazelnut flavoured milkshake to split with my date and didn't have any regrets. Just do it."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the ambiance - everything about this place was impeccable. A big shout to the best server ever, Patrick!"}
{"text":"Cool recipes and fun decor. Fast and attentive service. Very nice soft-boiled eggs Tartare de Buf was very good. Spaghetti are really good too. Egg pasta was delicious and cocktails were great. Worth also checking out the hidden bar in the back.  Prices are adequate.  My favorite restaurant in Montreal ! The staff is amazing, the food is great but the cocktails make is fabulous. Absolutely delicious! Comfort food that's too perfect to eat in sweatpants."}
{"text":"We walked in around noon on a Sunday and luckily got a table right away. The woman who sat us told us that we had to sit either at the bar or the high table. When I asked if we could sit at a regular table, she said we couldn't. No reason given. There were plenty of clean tables and nobody was waiting; they don't take reservations. Whatever.   We sat and ordered our food (and the Paris Brest milkshake. Soooooooo good). I ended up getting the eggs Benedict with ham and my girlfriend got the ham and cheese omelette.   My eggs benny were amazing. The yolk was perfectly runny, the Hollandaise was nice and rich, and they served it alongside these amazing potatoes, a roasted tomato, and really good applesauce(?). My girlfriend's omelette was a bit too underdone and lacked flavor.   It is pricy, especially for how much you get. But overall it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Stylish and intimate restaurant. The dishes offer an array of Quebec '50s diner fare that has been thoughtfully reimagined for the modern palate. The homemade spaghetti with black truffle, parmesan and egg is the height of epicurean decadence. The chicken live pâté was perfectly balanced and well-portioned.   The fried chicken was good but lacked zip and the accompanying dip could have been elevated with more assertive seasoning.   The cocktails were expertly crafted and I would definitely you Uber to take full advantage of their creative offerings - like the Pop Dat Fizz, a gin fizz with added complexity from a delicious popcorn syrup. The wine list is well curated and offers something for all oenophiles."}
{"text":"Location: Southwest, at the corner of Atwater and Notre-Dame Ouest. The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's a 5-minute walk from there. Street parking is available but metered and hard to get - you can find free parking on side streets but check the zoning.  The place: It's pretty small and the tables are close together. The decor is simple and similar to most hipster-like places. The vibe is good and I found the place to be cozy and bright.  The goods: I ordered a latte and two eggs with sausage and potatoes. I don't know which roast these guys use but the coffee was awful. I found it a little bitter and there was a smoky taste to it that almost seemed burnt. In terms of food, it was solid and the portion was pretty darn good. I would have liked it to be hotter. One of my friends ordered the French toast and there was nothing left on his plate when everything was said and done. He mentioned it was a bit too sweet but nonetheless, he enjoyed it.   Service: Good. We got there around 10ish and we were seated right away. The wait staff was friendly.  Price point: My food was 8.50 but I don't recall how much the latte was. Not bad considering the location."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby go here every time we are visiting Montreal. Amazing atmosphere, great music and food. The onion soup and beef tartare are fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been to Foiegwa for dinner! Which was an amazing experience.   My two best friends are from out of town, and they were visiting for Easter weekend. I haven't seen them for three years. They asked me to find a place near a metro; so the first restaurant that popped in my head for brunch was Foiegwa near Lionel Groulx.   The restaurant was booked so the hostess put me on the guest list. She said I will get a text when a table would be free. We went for a walk in Atwater Market, and started to catch up.   We got a text within 1/2hr. Got seated, and my friends ordered croque Madame and I ordered eggs Benedict with spinach and goat cheese, and everyone with a cup of coffee. Everything was super delicious! We Enjoyed every single bite of our dishes!   Service was super quick! After we finished our meal, right way we got our bills, and they asked us to free the table now...it was little disappointing because we didn't even finish our coffee... at the same time it's understandable since the lineup from outside was huge.   We ended up later at my favorite bakery."}
{"text":"Had a fun early dinner here with a friend before a show at the Corona.  It's a cute little spot with a funky bar and friendly service.  We were initially seated at the bar but there was a cancellation for a table so we were able to snag a better spot.  We shared an order of espelette peppers to start, served with bread and prosciutto.  They were a little too spicy for me, so I gave up and ate the bread and prosciutto which was quite good.  I had the cod  a la Bourguignonne, which was quite good, and my friend had the fish and chips, the special of the evening, which she said was very good.  All washed down with a decent bottle of burgundy and we were good to go..."}
{"text":"The inside of Foiegwa is so darn cute and quaint and CHARMING that you just want to move in. The space is actually quite small, but never feels cramped, and the servers move around the tables and tight spaces with grace and care. The vibes are on point. The service itself was amazing, pure and simple. Our server was a super cool French Canadian hipstery guy who clearly liked to have fun with his patrons. He was playful and witty and we had a good time. The food was well coursed out and everything tasted delicious. The kitchen is cranking out some classic French food with a bit of a twist, and they know what their doing back there. Don't even think about not getting a plate of their truffle spaghetti for the table.  Food Breakdown: Starters:  - French Onion Soup: a rather straightforward take on the classic. The broth itself had such a deep caramelized onion-y flavor, and the melted cheese on the broth soaked bread didn't suck either. - Beef Tartare: This was a lighter version of what I'm typically used to but the flavor was delicious. Savory and sweet. Crispy chips on top gave the tartare great texture and little dollops of truffle aioli gave it richness.   Entrees:  - Truffle Spaghetti with Egg Yolk: Quite simply one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. But the dish is deceptively simple--lots of butter, truffle, salt and pepper--and reminded me of the truffle pastas I eat in Italy, where the truffle doesn't ever overwhelm the dish but still has a strong presence. I almost licked my plate clean. The egg yolk gives the dish that addictive quality so you're still thinking about it long after you've left. - Fusili Bolognese: Now this might not be your typical Nonna's bolognese, but the meat sauce itself had no cream or milk to enrich it, and you could taste the red wine pretty strongly, so it felt like a pure version. This dish was very savory on the palate. I would've loved a dollop of mascarpone cheese to sort of combat the meatiness of the dish, but still a homerun."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été un jeudi soir et nous avions réservé. L'endroit est classe, moderne, lumineux et propre. Comme entrée, nous avons pris une tranche de foie gras maison à partager; c'était très bon mais je l'ai trouvé légèrement dispendieuse pour la quantité (18,5$ la tranche pas si grosse..). Ensuite, nous avons pris la tartelette aux légumes et chèvre comme plat principal (16,5$), qui était bonne et originale. Enfin, nous avons partagé une tarte tropézienne en dessert (7,5$), excellente! Au final, nous avons très bien mangé, et le service était excellent. Je dirais simplement que les prix sont légèrement élevés, mais j'imagine que c'est lié à l'endroit et au type de cuisine. Je le recommande à tout le monde!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice dinner experience at this small fine dinner which was originally a belle province! The kitchen is not very big so they have a limited menu with a few all star dishes!!! Started out with a scarlet cocktail served in a beautiful glass and a good punch of orange! I already knew I wanted to try the beef tartare and the black truffle and butter spaghetti !!!! The beef tartare was very fresh probably came from Atwater Market across the street I would say it was good had some Parmesan cheese in it but nothing spectacular I rarely dislike the dish! As for the black truffle and butter spaghetti it was delicious but it was not strong enough the truffle part was a little weak. Overall really pleasant experience and good value for a nice night out but probably not a repeat as he menu doesn't have a ton of variety although would totally go back for brunch :)"}
{"text":"I loved the feel of this restaurant, relaxed and unassuming - and yet the food was absolutely on point! We didn't have reservations which meant we sat at the bar, and I actually enjoyed that vantage point because we got to see into the kitchen a bit. We shared the Bone Marrow \"snack\" to start, which was just large enough for us to have a few bites each. There was a bit of grated truffle on top and a velvety Bordelaise sauce which was divine. I was in the mood for a lighter main course, so I selected the Warm Ratatouille and Goat Cheese Tart. There was a selection of vegetables on a puff-pastry base, and there was a hint of balsamic vinegar if I'm not mistaken. The size was big enough as it was, but it also came with a green salad simply dressed with a vinaigrette. I enjoyed the freshness and simplicity of the dish. I also tried a bite of the Fried Chicken with Gribiche sauce, which was at once moist, crispy, and creamy from the sauce; a luscious mouthful. I can't wait to return and taste more of the menu (and check out the bar next door)."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to have a reservation made by our air bnb host (he had connections!)for the night we arrived in Montreal visiting Canada for the first time.  We were able to get fit in at 6:30 pm.  when we arrived we were promptly seated at a table for two in the small dining room that seats about 35.  We were expecting big things according to our host who advised us it was hard to get a reservation for dinner and usually the waiting list is very long... So we felt very excited to be there.  we were not disappointed! I must say it was the best fish I've ever eaten in my life... It was the chef's special of the night Fresh caught mild fish cooked to perfection with crisp skin with caviar on top placed upon a bed of fresh asparagus and a wonderful hollandaise sauce.  We also had the truffle spaghetti which was rich and decadent.  Our cocktails were very good as well!  We won't ever forget our first French dinner in Montreal!  The prices also  amazing too!"}
{"text":"I know they are pretty know for the foie grass hamburger, but try the chicken, it is amazing  They also have amazing daily specials menu, that me and my 2 friends tried, including the deserts. I can go back anytime even for a drink and desert"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night. I've been to Atwater Cocktail Club, the speakeasy attached to Foiegwa, many times now and loved my experience each and every time. I knew their cocktail game was strong so was excited to finally try their food. I left greasy and bloated, but beaming.  I had heard so many good things about their truffle spaghetti that it would have been wrong not to order it. In addition to the pasta we had the bone marrow, chicken liver pate, market veggies, cheeseburger and in yolo let's have a heart attack fashion we added extra foie gras in the burger.  It was the perfect love child of French bistro meets greasy diner. The truffle spaghetti was salty, chewy, and everything you'd want to eat on a cheat day. The cheeseburger came with perfectly crispy fries- they also serve these next door at $3 a plate and are a must-have for late night munchies. The patty sandwiched between pillowy brioche buns was juicy and simply lovely (again, in an oily messy way). The foiegwa was nicely seared but was not particularly memorable.   The music deserves a special mention as well- this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"The chicken waffles were a bit cold, potatoes were great though. Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I have to admit, overall Foiegwa is a great place for drinks, food and late nights. It is located right outside Lionel metro, it's opened till 2 am, there's very a large variety of drinks and their beef tartare is absolutely the main reason why I come to Foiegwa.   I love the vibe that they have going on, cozy with a chic finish to it. I highly recommend and youll probably see me having drinks by the bar"}
{"text":"We were initially going to another place but it was closed, a local standing next to us heard our conversation and suggested this place to us and it was just amazing, service is one of the best l have seen in Montreal, the dishes are quite fulling, the double cheeseburger l order was world class. I suggest this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small for more like couple or small groups Service was good, The decor is lovely and cozy.My boy friend love burger with foie gras!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went here for dinner. The ambiance was great. Candles at every table. Service was amazing! And food was outstanding. My boyfriend and I shared the French Onion to start. BEST French onion I've ever had. The cheese was cooked to perfection, so much so that it was crunchy! No choking on cheese here. Then, my boyfriend and I got the black truffle egg pasta. To die for. Easily my favorite dish in Montreal so far. For dessert, we also shared a fresh cream and berries parfait type of dish. It was a French dessert so I don't know the name of it. But that was also amazing. I definitely recommend this place! Don't miss out on that pasta!!"}
{"text":"One word: amazing. Their black truffle pasta is on point; the blood orange cocktail was perfect and that brownie dessert with mascarpone cream and coffee dusting was phenomenal. Will be going back."}
{"text":"We were having Father's Day brunch at Foiegwa. The restaurant was small and crowded but waitresses came to serve us immediately which is a plus.  We had Benedictine eggs with smoked salmon and a smoothie of the day.  Everything was delicious and the restaurant itself is well-located just next to Atwater market."}
{"text":"I got told the burger was great so that's what I ordered. It was. It was cheesy and oozy and messy and delicious with a sort of oniony gravy and cheesy and cheesy. The bun was a perfect soft brioche type bun. It was a delicious burger and the fries were perfect - thin and salty and crispy. I was always planning on getting a burger, and good thing I was - because everything else on the menu was quite pricey. That's not to say it's not worth it - im sure it was - but I was expecting more diner food and a price point to match.  If someone else was buying me dinner, I'd go back and try more things! The milkshake was good but don't expect a thick malt-style shake. Service was good, servers were friendly. That always keeps my score high."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this spot. Reasonable wait times 20 minutes or so and steps to the Atwater market to use up the time just be sure not to stray farther than 5 minutes and to answer your phone as they will give up your spot. The one star off is for our drink order being way late (however both cocktails were great when they came after our food and the waitress gave us to go coffee cups) The confit duck omelette and smoked salmon rosti were great and ample portions. This isn't a super cheap breakfast joint so expect to pay for the ingredients on offer. I'd go back happily!"}
{"text":"This hidden resto/bar has a great vibe and cool decor but I didn't find it overly impressive. The drinks were great but incredibly expensive and service was almost completely absent. I had to get up twice to find our server despite us being the ONLY table. I ordered the full size steak tartare which was very good but didn't come with crackers or bread or anything to eat it on. Strange.   Great food and drinks but super pricey and poor service. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after reading the Yelp reviews on it, although I'm not sure I understand what the big deal is.   My boyfriend and I came to eat here after showing up at Vin Papillon and realizing they were on holiday as it was just down the street.  We were seated immediately but it took nearly 20 minutes to order drinks, which took even longer to arrive, and 30 to order our meal and that didn't arrive in a decent amount of time, either.   The menu is overpriced and the dishes are tiny.  Don't get me wrong -- I don't mind an expensive (read: fabulous) meal here or there (Toque! is fantastic and Parc restaurant might have the best raw fish I'll ever have) but for the lack of complexity in Foiegwa's dishes, the presentation, service, and portion sizes the $120 after a modest tip for a starter, one scant for two plate and two glasses of wine their pricing seemed absolutely absurd.    The Daumen Cote du Rhone was actually decent but it seemed most of their good wine picks were just grabbed from Oenopole's wine list, so there was really nothing new there for me.    Their deviled eggs were decent.  The aioli was okay.  They were cooked to perfection and had herring flakes and chives on top as a substitution for salt and to add to the complexity of the dish.  Regardless though, they were just some deviled eggs that tasted a little like fishy salt.  I've also seen this exact dish and presentation two other places before so in all honesty, it was actually quite boring.    When our dover sole fish with accompaniments arrived we were shocked to find the portions of the meal so tiny.  There was a pittance of rice and green beans.  The rice was drenched in butter and seemed to have tiny speckles of pepper in it and nothing else (of course Foiegwa described it as a pilaf on the menu..) and the green beans were undercooked and also slathered in butter.  I actually had trouble slicing through them with a knife in order to eat them.    The fish itself, while cooked to perfection, was also pretty boring and presented with no garnish other than the slightly yellowed sauce it was sitting in.  Of course this sauce was basically nothing more than.. (you guessed it) butter!   Atmospherically, I do like the way Foiegwa was decorated.  It was really loud, however, and we were placed at a table that seemed to get bumped by the wait staff on numerous occasions.  I was sort of blown away at how loud it was in there given the music was actually being played at a minimal volume.   All-in-all I definitely don't recommend this place.  They won't do a great job of waiting on you, nor feeding you.  Most likely, they will simply gouge your wallet without much of a 'why'.  While Foiegwa is the new face in town (most likely from the same owners as many others I suspect) they're going to have to try a little harder to earn their keep.   If you hadn't gathered, I'll tell you anyways, I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had just gotten in to Montreal and decided we wanted a late night bite. Foiegwa was still open and we headed over. We started with frogs legs. The ranch dill sauce was good though the legs themselves were just okay. The gazpacho was nice, especially the delicious brioche covered in crab meat that came with it. The vegetables with bagna cuda were great. We shared a fried chicken sandwich which came with honey they sourced from their roof top. It was tender juicy chicken that was barely breaded and went perfectly with the honey.   The spot definitely has a cute diner theme. The staff was very friendly. Reasonably priced. I'd recommend for late night dining or any time."}
{"text":"Love love love - so glad foiegwa has become a staple in the neighbourhood of little burgundy/Saint henri. Whether it's brunch or dinner this place has won my heart. Must order items for brunch are the ricotta pancakes and chicken &waffles and for dinner the truffle spaghetti / beef tartar /bone marrow and foiegras burger"}
{"text":"I heard so much hype about this place, maybe my expectations were too high. I went there for brunch with friends. I had the ham grilled cheese, my friends had the blueberries pancakes and the eggs and sausages breakfast. Coffee was ok, food was ok. Everything was just ok, actually. Wouldn't come back here for brunch."}
{"text":"Breakfast done right!  Blueberry pancakes ... super delish and comforting... kinda tasted like waffles and pancakes in one... definitely made with love! The scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, baked tomatoe and apple sauce were also delish.  As a teen, I used to go to la belle province which was located where foiegwa has now settled in. At first I was having a hard time accepting the change, because my childhood memory was all about stopping at la belle province before heading home.(things kids in the 80's&90's did) my bestie suggested that we meet at Foiegwa for Sunday brunch and I accepted to break the ice and have my first meal at Foiegwa... while waiting for my friend to arrive, I decided to have a mimosa (what better way to break the ice?) enjoyed every bit of it. The inside is sooo much different than what I remember it to be.. the layout is cute but from pictures I thought the new owners had preserved the larger space... anyways, they open at 10am for brunch Fridays-Sundays... luckily for us, I had arrived a little after they opened  and was able to secure seats for my friend and I by the bar.  I would definitely return as the food was delish, service was prompt, pricing was reasonable, and most of all they served Mimosas!!!"}
{"text":"Foiegwa was everything we had anticipated and hoped for. My boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal and read that Foiegwa was a must try. We forgot to make a reservation but were promptly sat by the host when we arrived on Saturday night. I wish I could recall her name because she was so friendly and attentive. She suggested the Atwater Market Vegetables appetizer and it was perfect pair to what would be a very dense meal. My boyfriend had the Cheeseburger w/ extra Foie Gras and I had the Truffle spaghetti. Lord have mercy on my soul because that Truffle spaghetti was d e l i c i o u s. I can't recommend this place enough -- if you're in Montreal head on over to Foiegwa and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend, brother, and I came here for a late brunch on Saturday. It was safe to say it was delicious. In spite, we were placed in an extremely squishy corner and the table was way too small for three people. It barley fit all the food we ordered. Keeping in mind, the restaurant itself isn't very large.   The brunch menu is only served on Friday (10-3pm), Saturday & Sunday (9:30am-3:30pm). We ordered the Confit Duck Omelette $17, Rosti $17.75, and least but not last, grilled cheese slices dipped in 2 soft boiled eggs $12.95. Firstly, my boyfriend's Confit Duck Omelette meal which was filling but he would have preferred it more if there was more confit duck. I recommend La Avenue Restaurant for their Confit Duck Benedict. Meanwhile, my borther Rosti meal was delicious, but not as filling. The house cream was to die for. My brother was still a bit hungry after his meal and decided to have some of grilled cheese and potatoes. Overall the grilled cheese was good but I think I would have preferred it if they used poached eggs instead of soft boiled egg."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I was attracted by the beautiful interior design.   To start, I had the bone marrow appetizer followed by the truffle spaghetti. When I usually get bone marrow, they're split length-wise so that it's easier to eat out of, and thought that the portion was a bit on the smaller side. It was super tasty otherwise.  The spaghetti was delicious! The truffle was very aromatic and it was topped with a generous amount of shaved parm cheese (I think).   This was for dinner, but I can't wait to try their famous brunch menu :)"}
{"text":"Very nice brunch in a great decor. The food tastes really good, and the service was great. I can't wait to try their truffle spaghettis next time!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Montreal! Love the food there, especially the spaghetti with butter and black truffle, and the burger. Highly recommended! A must have if you're visiting."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times and I enjoy the venue for its decor and vibe. The diner menu is creative compared to other options nearby. It includes burgers, fries, and milkshakes but they also offer some French brasserie options like tartare, terrine and escargots. The food is good, but not great. My recommendation would be the cheeseburger with extra foie gras and frites. Also tried their fried frog legs with ranch sauce that were pretty good! Get a cola float as their cocktails aren't on par. Service was friendly and efficient when I last visited on a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"FOIEGWA!!!!!  Je peux franchement dire que ce restaurant est un gros coup de coeur pour mes amis et moi.   Pour avoir pris ma réservation à la dernière minute, nous avons été assis au bar. À trois ça va. J'étais pas super chaude à l'idée de m'asseoir au bar, mais après cette expérience, qu'on m'assoie toujours au bar! Le mixologue en charge, Jean-Philippe a vraiment ajouté un gros plus plus à notre soirée.   Bouffe et boissons: Nous sommes tous curieux et pas dédaigneux, fait qu'on s'est fait un plaisir de déguster plusieurs plats à trois.   Apéro: Bloody Ceasar (PIMP!), Bières et cocktail Thai Kwan Do Impressions: je croyais que c'était mon bloody à moi le meilleur, mais bon, ils ont bien su m'impressionner! Miam!  Le vin: belle carte des vins, mon ami sommelier s'est bien gâté. (j'ai oublié le nom :/)  En entrée: Le tartare de boeuf, truffe et parmesan et le sandwich brioché au fois gras poêlé. Impressions: je suis fan de tartare et il était simplement parfait! Pis le sandwich.. tsé quand foie gras rime avec bonheur!!  Trou Normand: J'ai fait découvrir à notre barman et à mes amis, le Piger Henricus Réduit: Chaud! Je crois qu'ils ont tous été agréablement surpris!! ESSAYEZ-LE!  Plats principaux: Après les précieux conseils de notre serveur/barman/nouvel ami, nous avons pris Le Cheez, la sauce à \"big mac\" maison.. MIAM et la viande hachée goûtais la qualité supérieure, Le poulet bio frit, juteux et croustillant à souhait et LA pièce de résistance...Le spaghetti maison, truffe noire et oeuf à 64 degrés. NON MAIS MY GOD!! C'est juste trop \"bon dans yeule\"!! J'en ai rêvé tsé!!  Desserts: On s'est un peu fait gâter par notre nouvel ami J-P, non seulement par nos conversations plus qu'intéressantes, mais avec deux succulents desserts. Un genre de crumble aux pommes, yummm, et un brownie bien chaud et fondant avec une crème mascarpone. J'en bave encore!!  Over all, pas besoin de vous dire que nous avons beaucoup aimé notre expérience et que nous nous y retrouverons bientôt! Merci JP et merci Foiegwa!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a 2.5 I would, but I feel like a 3 isn't accurate.    I really wanted to love this place, I really did. The menu looked very exciting and delicious, the decor was fun yet classy, and the staff was sweet and courteous. But the big let down for me was the food; everything lacked nuance and flavor. Such interesting ingredient combinations should be celebrated, but I felt like everything on the plate was very one note and under seasoned. That isn't to say the meal wasn't nice, I just feel that there are more enticing places in the neighborhood. Maybe it was just an off night. I'm on the fence about whether or not I'll be back to give the kitchen a chance at redemption."}
{"text":"Came for a boozy brunch here my birthday morning after it was recommended to me by several friends. We were happy we made it!  We arrived around 10:30 am on a Saturday and expected a huge line. There were several people waiting at the door but we walked right up to the hostess and she said there were seats at the bar available which nobody seemed to want so we were seated immediately.  The bar is fun because you get to see some amazing drinks being made. One table ordered a round of shots that were half vanilla liqueur and half espresso which looked like a great way to start the day!  I ordered a cereal killer cocktail and had the smoked salmon dish while my wife opted for a mimosa and some grilled cheese with soft boiled egg. My dish was clearly the star and I really enjoyed it!  The cocktails were also great and added a fun play on breakfast. Would love to try everything here but our stomachs are only so big.  One great thing is the Atwater Market is across the street so you can walk around there after breakfast to burn off the calories."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience here (and the fact that it was a 5 minute walk from my AirBnB!) The real stars here were the beef tartar and the cocktails. The rest of the food was good but way overpriced. Frog legs were forgettable, the steak and foie gras burger were nice (but nothing special) and the chocolate mousse was pretty good but the whipped cream on top most certainly came from a can. Came expecting to be wowed and was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Ah voilà une bonne adresse pour faire un bon petit brunch. Je dois avouer que j'ai été déçu car je pensais trouver du foie gras dans tous les plats et ce n'est pas le cas. Bon vous pouvez en rajouter partout pour 9$ mais de base ce n'est pas inclus.  Le cadre est vraiment sympa, je ne sais pas trop comment le décrire car c'est assez old school mais on se sent bien ici. Il y a partout sur les murs des caricatures de personnalités connues.   J'ai beaucoup hésité dans mon choix de brunch mais j'ai finalement craqué pour les Chicken waffles. L'assiette était bien garnie et la qualité était bonne. Au final avec un bon café filtre c'est vraiment un très bon rapport qualité prix. En plus de cela le personnel est vraiment souriant et agréable.   Je pense que je vais y retourner avec les beaux jours car la proximité avec le marché Atwater et le canal Lachine laisse présager une bonne balade pour digérer."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour le déjeuner et c'était très bien! Malgré le prix un peu dispendieux, les repas étaient délicieux ! Aussi, je vous conseille le milkshake .. troooooop bon!   Finalement, l'endroit est superbe et le staff très accueillant !"}
{"text":"Location: super close to Atwater market  It's a really cute old school dinner with a new twist. The name, as it implies, indicates that you can add foie gras to any dish for $9.95! Because I went for breakfast, I didn't try this.   It's a relatively small place so going a little earlier would probably be best to avoid lines. My sister and I went at around 11:30 AM and got a spot right away, but the place was already pretty filled and it was a freezing cold day.   I ordered the ham eggs benedict - a classic and always good. Next time I'd probably want to try the truffle spaghetti, it sounded amazing! My sister opted for something more original and got the roasted vegetables and goat cheese tart. It was very beautifully plated and quite delicious.   This is definitely somewhere I'd want to try again!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Nothing spectacular. I came here twice hoping the second time would blow me away. Ironically, not at a lot of foie gras dishes. Slightly lack of imagination in the execution of their dishes. The ambiance is really cool though, worth going for drinks."}
{"text":"Very good brunch spot in the Atwater area. Went last Sunday for the second time. I like the fact that I never really had to wait too long to get a table despite the place always being pretty full. The staff is really nice and the food as well. The périgourdine omelette was very tasty as well as the pancakes. Service was a little slow but overall very good experience."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal! I had the roti (which tastes like a latke topped with salmon). It was so incredible! My husband had the chicken and waffles, which he said was good, but he didn't rant or rave as nearly as much as I did. Very cute restaurant right across the street from Atwater market. Nice service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Foiegwa, you almost killed me with your spiked \"non-alcoholic\" London Virgin but I forgive you because a week later I'm still obsessing over your Truffle Spaghetti Maison like a steamy one night stand. Methinks our Bocata friends (who recommended Foiegwa) phoned ahead to make sure we had a \"spirited\" evening .  Foiegwa is a tight little corner hot spot that packs in patrons nightly so definitely make a reservation. The menu offerings are all the things they do well so any choice is a winner. But let me again emphasize how good the Truffle Spaghetti is! When every table has at least one order of this dish, your FOMO will be tears of regret if you don't get this dish. My dear daughter ordered the pasta bolognese and she loved it but if she could have devoured my dish after sampling a bite of my Truffle Spaghetti, she would. She is now back at college crying in her dorm thinking of the missed strands of spaghetti coated in buttery black truffle sauce, mixed with a newly broken egg yolk under a Mont Royal heap of freshly grated parmigiano reggiano cheese. Don't let this happen to you. It's over 2200 miles (over 3200 km) for us to get back to this Montreal hot spot. Get this dish if you ever have the opportunity to go.  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Going to Foiegwa was an experience full of surprises.   Surprise #1: this place that had been hyped as the new no-reservation restaurant actually does take reservations, and you'll want to have one lest you get turned away like the people who came in after us.   Surprise #2: attentionate service. We were greeted by the friendliest host in my recent memory, who went above and beyond to accommodate our lack of reservation and make us feel welcome. In fact, we wish she had been our waitress, who while still friendly, wasn't as enthusiastic. In the only downside of our evening, as the restaurant got busier around 9pm, the speed of the service suffered.  Surprise #3: for a restaurant opened in an old Belle Pro under the guise of selling heavy, decadent food, the food was actually quite refined and balanced. Yes, the food is rich and won't do your diet any good, but it's packed full of flavour and complexity - not just fat and salt. The burger was my favourite in a long time and the pasta with the truffle butter and egg was on point. Special shout-out to the soft serve ice cream with butter-fried peanuts - a must if you're not full after your meal.   Surprise #4: the price. I thought there had been a mistake when we got our bill: 98$ tip included for a 3 course meal with cocktails for 2. Now I acknowledge this isn't necessarily cheap, but for the amount and quality of what we got, it's definitely great value.   A few extras:  -Portions are larger than they seem: a little goes a long way. We found that a snack and a main each were plenty. Those with smaller appetites could definitely be happy with 2 appetizers.  -Fries: 100x better than the sad old Belle Pro that used to be there.  -Cocktails: clean and simple. Nothing too fancy or over the top - go next door to ACC after your meal if you're looking for something more special."}
{"text":"Super bon brunch hyper gras hyper sucré comme on aime ! On a goûté le chicken and waffle et le pain perdu au sirop d'érable et crème chantilly maison. Super bon ! Seul bémol, ils ne font pas de chai latte  Le bonus : on laisse son numéro de cellulaire et ils t'appellent quand ta table est prête ! Pas besoin d'attendre des heures dans le froid"}
{"text":"we had a lovely time at Foiegwa! it's a packed space, so don't have too high of expectations for personal space. we had a lovely waitress who helped us navigate the menu and gave us plenty of time. our favorite dish was actually the ceasar salad!  the spaghetti with egg is a definite must!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to try Foiegwa, and wow... what a great experience! First of all, I have to give the hostess a shout-out. She was so lovely and accommodating both on the phone and in person. Our waitress was also kind and very informative. Onto the decor: so cool! The space was much smaller than I expected, but I really enjoyed the cosiness. As for the food, I was really impressed. I had the veggie appetizer, truffle pasta and sundae. The flavours were on point and the portions were the perfect size for me. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Although they do not take reservations for brunch, their exquisite creations are definitely worth the wait. The foie gras burger we had was amazing and will be forever one of our fav brunch places. The place is always bustling with customers so try to find a off-peak hour to avoid the lineup. Haven't tried the dinner menu yet but based on our brunch experience, it should be amazing as well! :)"}
{"text":"I do not understand the fuzz about this place, the plates are small, the prices are high. The food is good but not great, I took the duck hachi-Parmentier with foie gras, it was good but the foie gras was invisible. My boyfriend took the burger with foie gras also (it's in the name tho) smallest piece of foie gras ever seen in a big ass pool of sauce."}
{"text":"You know when a place is overhyped and then it ends up disappointing? Well, that certainly is not the case for Foiegwa. I still remember when this place used to be a La Belle Pro and I was doubtful that they could fit a brunch spot here.   The decor is absolutely beautiful, kind of like your standard diner but elevated with some whimsical and eclectic touches like the gold frosted mirrors and bw illustrations.   The food is outstanding. Everything from the uf bénédictine to the chicken and waffles was exceptional. It's always a good sign when a place's menu is relatively small so you know they're doing the few they have exceptionally well. I had the fresh fruits with sabayon, perfect blend between a fresh and a light sweet flavour. I can't say I'm not in love. If you're going on the weekend, either get there early or expect to wait at least 15 minutes. It's well worth the wait and you can't go wrong choosing Foiegwa."}
{"text":"Amazing French restaurant. Perfect ratatouille. Jus like how the dish is know. It's really amazing!!!! Also the mimosa. It was quiet busy but was able to get seats using Yelp. Pretty waitresses though"}
{"text":"Was in the Atwater Marche area and couldn't help but be drawn into this restaurant. Love how it has an old school vibe with a modern twist. I couldn't stop looking around and staring at all the details from the marble community table top to the caricatures of famous, historic Québécois.  I asked one of the servers if anyone pictured has ever come in. She hesitated and smiled, \"Nah, they're all pretty much dead.\"  We shared a good laugh.   Although you can order a side of foiegwa with everything I thought it might be too rich with the truffle spaghetti everyone has been howling about. I sat at the bar and saw all the food coming out and the spaghetti was definitely the most popular. Unfortunately, I was not impressed and actually a little disappointed that I spent so much on lunch. That's my fault for not ordering anything with foiegwa. I mean, you are at a restaurant that bares its name.  The mimosa was INCREDIBLE though.  Had to resist all temptation for ordering second one.   I will have to come back and try the cheeseburger with foiegwa."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot. The drinks are amazing and the beef tartare is the best I've ever had. Their veggie appetizer is mouthwatering and the truffle spaghetti is delicious. Go to their little bar in the back alley afterwards called Atwater Cocktail Club."}
{"text":"Over priced for the food quality. Presentation is nice but thats about it. The service was good though."}
{"text":"The design is very well thought of, there is a modern feel to it. The food was delicious. I ordered the veggie, goat cheese tart. The crust was perfect, the mix of veggies was on the point and the amount of goat cheese was just right. I am usually skeptical sometimes when it comes to goat cheese, it can take over the taste and ruin the flavour of the meal.   The cocktails are pretty fabulous, and the service was great."}
{"text":"First things first: this place is maybe a 3-minute walk from Lionel-Groulx metro, which in this bitter cold is worth at least a star of its own.   Now, onto the important stuff...  To start, we ordered the escargot (which I'm told might have actually been periwinkle) and the salmon rillette. The escargot was doused in butter and garlic, which I unashamedly sopped up with bread. The salmon rillette was served on endives which, in my opinion, allows you to appreciate the flavours way more than some crusty old cracker or toasted bread.   For the mains, we ordered the blackened cod and the fried chicken. The cod was perfectly cooked and served in the most oozingly delicious beurre blanc. Honestly, if we were sitting in a dark corner I would have licked that plate clean. The fried chicken was crisp and tender and seasoned to perfection. If the chicken connoisseur ever tried it, he might put this in contention for the pengest munch. Plus, the garlic chips it comes served with... are you kidding me?! Whoever came up with this recipe needs to patent it, open a factory and start bagging those things. With the money they earn, they could run for politics on a pure chip platform. Soon, everyone on the planet will have tried those chips, and this person will be the most influential celebrity in the world. People will beg them for the recipe, but they'll never give it up. And one day when they pass away, the recipe will disappear with them, which will lead to a global crisis the lies of which we have never seen. Tragic."}
{"text":"I finally tried Foiegwa after having heard so many great things about it and I loved it ! It's presented as a diner but the inside while still casual and relaxed is still a little bit fancy in its own way. Definitely make a reservation though especially on the weekend because there is limited seating inside and you definitely want to make sure you get to try this place ! Also because of the limited seating this isn't an ideal location for a group dinner especially without a reservation. Our server was very friendly and made sure to check on us frequently to make are we had everything we need and the hostess was very friendly and accommodating as well. And now we get to the good stuff ... THE FOOD:) The food quality here is way above that of a typical diner. We had the escargot to start and the cheeseburger and fries as the main meal. The escargot were big,  well cooked and very well seasoned ,  im not usually big on escargot but these were very well made. And now the cheese burger ! Anyone who knows me knows I LOVE a good burger and this burger I can safely say is now in my top 2 favourite burgers in the city !  It sounds like a simple item but everything about it hit the mark perfectly from the fresh bun to the perfectly cooked and seasoned burger patty and the melty gooey delicious cheese inside , to the onion Au jus they serve at the bottom that flavours the bottom bun. you can also get the cheeseburger with extra foie gras inside which adds a nice layer of richness to it. I've been dreaming about this burger since I had it :) The fries were great too , well seasoned and cooked perfectly. the cocktails were good too I had the scarlet and the Pimms cup both were very good but the Pimms cup was my favourite , it was refreshing and tasty! The only thing I would say they could improve on is the fact that it took a while for them to come and clear up empty dishes or cups (ex they brought our second cocktail but never cleared away the cup for the first). That being said that's a very small detail and I was very happy with my experience here and I can safely say I will definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"Food and service here was great! My two friends and I shared small plates and were super happy with it!"}
{"text":"I love this diner!! The drinks are good and the food is delicious!! I started with the Bloody Caesar (Vodka, Mezcal, Clamato, Celery Bitters and chimichurri rim) of course followed by Pimm's Cup (Pimm's, Fernet Branca, and cucumber). My cousin and I shared the cheesburger and added foie gras for $9.95. It was very good and filling but I don't think it was worth adding the foie gras. It would have been just as good without it. We also shared the beef tartare which was amazing! If you love beef tartare you gotta try it!! Both plates came with tons of fries and I was surprised how good the fries were!!  They had the right amount of salt. We were too full for dessert. I will definitely be back to try the duck confit and their other cocktails."}
{"text":"I finally got to try foiegwa! I really enjoyed it. The decor is nice, the ambiance is pleasant, and more importantly the food is delicious.  I kept hearing about the burger with the extra foie gras, so obviously I had to try it.   It is indeed awesome. It's not the best burger I've had in my life however, which is what I was hoping for.   At 27-28$, I fully expected to have my mind blown. What I got was a really good - no; an excellent burger with great meat, a good bun, and a hint of a taste of foie gras. The taste of the cheese was completely lost, and so is taste of foie gras.  I think there's a better burger to be made with these quality ingredients. Maybe a different, tastier cheese, and perhaps a different cooking method for the foie gras so the taste is more pronounced.   I think there were caramelized onions? I'm not sure.   Maybe even a completely different burger with the same ingredients but without the sauce, and with salad, tomato, raw onions and cold foie gras. That could be exiting, I don't know.   Oh and one more thing - my friend had the spaghetti. It looks awesome, and he described it as really good. He was a little disappointed by the size of the portion however. I get that truffle sauce is expensive, but pastas are not. It's not a valid reason to put 15 spaghettis on a plate and call it a main course.  Nevertheless, I still recommend that you try this place at least once. I look forward to trying the spaghetti on a future visit actually.  Yeah. It's good. Pricey though. The kinda place where beautiful yuppies go to be seen, and they overpay a little for that privilege.  It's nice that their kitchen is open late, very convenient.  I wish these was a bigger and better beer selection.   The place looked like it would feel a bit crammed, but it's not that bad. We had a table by the window, it worked out for us 3 big men.   Maybe if you have a small table for 2 in the middle by the bathroom it would probably feel a little bit more crammed.   Anyway. The food is good. You should go."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, Aesthetic atmosphere, small weight time, and they payed attention to detail. They didn't rush us to finish even though they were busy and our food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great vibe; great decor; even better food.  Foiegwa is an all around home run.  Atmosphere wise, I was a big fan of the diner feel and the drawings of famous patrons on the wall.  It made me feel like I was in a small cafe/diner in Paris.    Food wise, I had the decadent organic fried chicken, which was extremely large and very flavorful.  The real draw though was my girlfriend's dish, which was the homemade spaghetti with butter and black truffle, topped with an egg yolk.  This was an extremely rich dish with such a deep buttery and truffle flavor that I honestly had never experienced before.  My girlfriend enjoyed it so much that she claimed she legitimately dreamed about it that night.    Additionally, they have a great cocktail menu and to fit right in with the diner feel, they have a strong dessert menu too.  So if you are just in town visiting or are a resident of the city, I highly recommend making it over to Foiegwa as soon as possible."}
{"text":"MUST TRY: garlic truffle butter spaghetti with egg! I didn't have much expectation beforehand since I found their menu quite limited in term of choices of dishes. Many people have been telling me how pricey the place is, and Instagram feeds showed me very typical brunch options (average plating too). However, when I got to try their dishes, especially the truffle butter spaghetti, it was like HEAVEN! It is very rich and creamy, the most phenomenal spaghetti I have ever tried! I also tried the blueberry pancake and that was just so so.  The place is quite small and I can imagine that when it gets crowded in the weekend, the lineup can be crazy. Try to go during the week and it should be really okay. I find the restaurant very bright and cosy, but honestly, I find the place overpriced for their food and service. But remember to try the spaghetti! It's so good!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool and delicious restaurant! It has a old diner vibe but with a modern twist! I had a Coffee and Paris Brest milkshake which was divine! I had the black truffle scrambled eggs topped with fresh ketchup. It was delicious! Regrettably, I was too full to get the brownie with coffee cream! The brunch was amazing! It's also located across the street from a really great outdoor market and park!"}
{"text":"So far, the best restaurant I've had in Montreal.  Our group went for a brunch. Food was great- we had a truffle pasta, waffle with fried chicken and blueberry pancakes. Especially I liked the truffle pasta - I couldn't stop eating it even though I'm not the big fan of buttery pasta. The fried chicken and waffle was an interesting combination of savory and sweet taste. Personally, the pancake was relatively less impressive. Service was good too. The server was super friendly. Maybe only the minus was the space- the table was small, we had a hard time placing dishes. Definitely, I'll visit again. ;)"}
{"text":"Foiegwa is a bizaar little food experience. I would say the ambiance is great, the drinks are great the Steak Tartar is to die for - screw it as an appetizer just go for the meal with fries. As for other things on the menu : i tried their signature  pasta, the cheese burger, the escargo with garlic butter sauce;  i would say are good, but not worth what you pay for it. The Steak Tartar, however is worth it and make sure to get it spicy if your into that. I love paying for good food and the experience of it, but at Foiegwa your left a little wondering if it was worth paying that much for what you ate. I would say it just really depends what you go for. The other thing i will have to point out is that there is  a major fly problem in this place - i've never had a high end dining experience and had to deal with flies before. Maybe invest in some bug spray ;)"}
{"text":"Talk about GOOD FOOD! We came on a Monday and it was quite busy. Make sure to reserve to secure yourself a spot. I had the boeuf bourgignon which was TO DIE FOR. I felt like I was having a \"homey\" meal and it was so comforting for a cold day. The drinks were delicious and reminded me of the cocktails they serve in NYC. I would totally recommend this place for a girls night out, a birthday, or even a tinder date ;) haha! 5 STARS"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to brunch here after seeing it called a hot new restaurant on blogs. But I think I ordered the wrong thing. Against my better judgement, I had the blueberry ricotta pancakes. Now, I'm not normally a person who orders pancakes at restaurants. I make a killer buttermilk pancake recipe and no restaurant pancake has ever lived up to my homemade 'cakes, so I avoid ordering them at restaurants. But something about these pancakes called out to me so I ordered them... and they were just okay. They definitely weren't bad because you'd have to be a terrible cook to make bad pancakes. But they were just okay. Maybe they would have been better if they had come with more than a teaspoon of blueberries. On the plus side, they came with real maple syrup at no extra charge unlike most Ontario restaurants."}
{"text":"Le 5, c'est surtout pour l'expérience culinaire! Le tartare est excellent et le spaghetti est un incontournable! Lorsque j'y suis allé c'était bondé... Donc, je vous conseilles fortement de reservé! L'ambiance et le décor nous rappelle les anciens \"dining\" rétro à l'américaine! Ps: Le restaurant ferme à 2am!"}
{"text":"I had gone for drinks at the Atwater club next door and spoiled myself with a cheeseburger. I think it might have been the best cheeseburger I'd ever had. It was soooo juicy and saucy. I'm assuming it's the same cheeseburger they serve at Foiegwa since I heard they share their kitchen. Now onto Foiegwa: went very early for breakfast and the place was empty but it got packed around 11. Shared the blueberry ricotta pancakes and the smoked salmon on that wonderful potato hashbrownything. Perfect combo of salty and sweet. Ooooo And their coffee is realllly good. Important to note: do not go with children/babies/toddlers. They will refuse them at the door due to their liquor license."}
{"text":"Really cool diner slash chic vibe. Pretty good food. Supremely overpriced for what it is. I wouldn't go back other than for a drink, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying it."}
{"text":"I love good diner fare.  The food at this atmospheric, upscale diner was absolutely incredible.  Who knew a cheeseburger could be this delicious?  The staff and service was phenomenal.  Friend had escargot and a pasta dish.  For dessert we had the not too sugary chocolate mousse.  I'm not even a big chocolate person but this was fantastic.  Will definitely be back when I visit Montreal again.  Hit up the Atwater cocktail bar next door.  Everything was great!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with friends for my first time...we had an array of dishes to try, I had the salmon eggs Benedict and was not impressed. It lacked freshness and flavour and had an overwhelming amount of hollandaise sauce. Although I did not have the chicken with waffles, it did looked very delicious and was told it was. The decor is very nice and trendy, great location however the service was terrible.  I asked for a spoon for my coffee from 3 people before I got one & everyone else at the table used their fork because they were tired of waiting. We also never had our water glasses refilled or were asked if we liked our meals after it was served. Waited over 20 mins for our receipts after our table was cleared. Perhaps brunch isn't their strong point - will have to return for dinner and maybe the service will be different."}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture pour tous les goûts, quoiqu'un peu \"lourde\". Joli décor, service agréable. Je suis venue en famille pour le souper et nous avons tous apprécié nos plats et nos cocktails assez classiques.  Seul bémol: service un peu lent et assez bruyant. Il vaut mieux réserver d'avance."}
{"text":"Solid place. Their truffle pasta w egg is outstanding. So is their tartare de boeuf. Foie gras option are limited and mediocre - surprising given the resto's name. Wish they offered light dessert options to balance the heaviness of their meals. But I suppose \"all out heavy\" is a thing in Mtl and this place isn't placed at the extreme end of this spectrum anyway. Drinks are ok but nothing special. Nonetheless, very much worth a repeat on the basis of the first two dishes mentioned."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch with my girls squad. I admit, the fact that it was a rainy Friday morning might have influenced my mood. Still, the breakfast menu was very basic. I ordered a classic breakfast, two eggs, sausages etc. And my friends tried the blueberry pancakes and a kind of breakfast grilled cheese. Overall, it was okay. I don't think it's worth the price compared to other breakfast place. Plus, it's a really small restaurant. The service though was impeccable and I will nonetheless come back another time for dinner."}
{"text":"Where do I start,  Pretty much everything I put in my mouth was just amazing. We ordered the Veggie appetizer, the Dover Sole, fries, hamburger and a salad. I know it sounds like a weird combination of all sorts of food, but gosh was it worth it. We originally didn't order the hamburger, but we kept on seeing other people eat it and we couldn't resist any longer.  The burger was perfect, juicy and most of all tasty. The Dover sole was much too small to be told to share it between two people, and it was expensive but God Dam was that fish perfect so it made up for being such a small portion.  The Veggies were perfect The salad was perfect The fries were perfect!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé mon experience assise au comptoir du bar, voir le barmaid preparer les drinks. J'ai appecié leur systeme d'attente, ils te textent quand ta table est prete et tu peux faire un tour au marché Atwater.."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, beau décor mais nos plats n'étaient pas du tout à hauteur du prix. Le serveur au bar nous arrosait constamment en faisant ses cocktails. Nous lui avons dit, pour lui c'est le risque lorsqu'on est assis au bar...  Tellement d'autres endroits géniaux à Montréal."}
