{"text":"I'm a huge fan of spaghetti bolognese and I always order the same few things at hk style cafe...I've seen prices climb up from $3.99, $4.99, $5.99, $6.45 (for new fountain today) and as high as $7.50. The one here is decent, more filling than the portion looked and definitely the cheesiest I've seen! It was a nice surprise to see it once I opened up the box. I was really hungry and just wanted something that was tasty and filled me up. I kind of forget about the Chinese food court places - but definitely a good option when you're on the go or just can't be bothered to cook and just want to keep it casual. You get to choose either soup or tea or coffee or soya milk. Honey lemon +0.75. Nice customer service - one tip: it would be fantastic if they could add peas and corn in there to include some veggie content!"}
{"text":"Ok yelp world, here's the cheapest deal north of the 49th parallel.  (Shhhh it's a secret, I've got a secret!)

New Fountain Fast Food is located in the food court of the recently renovated Metro Square food court.  And for $4 (yes four bucks) plus taxes you can get a combo lunch of carb, protein and sauce.  Not only that you also get a bowl of fairly decent hot a sour soup, and a cup of soy milk!  I had actually instinctively handed over a $5 plus a toonie, but the guy only took the bill and said it was 4 something and smiled.

I ordered the Portuguese style chicken, which came out neon yellow, obviously sauce from a can, but it had big chunks of chicken and slices of potatoes.  It'd be exactly what I would have made at home, but with the soup and drink, I don't think I would have saved much money if I had to cook it myself.  Is this anywhere near the roasted chicken leg and Portuguese curry sauce I had in Macao?  Heck no, but I paid $7 Canadian there (which was relatively cheap for where I was) and this was fricken $4 bucks!

Buddy of mine ordered the bitter melon and beef, which he said was fine.

The sauces here are all obviously pre-made and from a can/bottle, but who the heck cares.  It'd cost me $3 just to buy the sauce from a market.

It's quick, it's decent, and its cheaper than Mickie Ds!  This place has had a price freeze since the 90s.  Why make lunch when I can just pop by here?"}
{"text":"Located in a food court, this is the most inexpensive stall of them all and you get the most for your dollar. 

Most items are priced at $4 and some up to $6, however all of them will come with a soup and beverage (lemon tea or soy drink). 

A little something I noticed, I found that if you insist to opt out of the beverage while emphasizing the goodness of soup, the man will make a very noticeable point to give you more greens, meat, legumes and overall substance to increase the heartiness of your soup...ultra win most definitely.

Favorite dish is curry beef brisket on rice, that in combination with fortified soup is a very satiating meal. 

Recommend you visit, friendly owner, big menu... I will return again and again."}
{"text":"Super busy little gem of a food court tucked away in a little plaza. There are 6 food stalls ranging from traditional Chinese food, to BBQ, Korean and Thai food. 

Hard to choose, but we decided to give New Fountain a go. 

Our number 1 mistake is that we came at lunch and so it was packed! Thankfully we were able to find a seat very quickly. 

Ordered the noodle soup with fish fillet and my significant other ordered Szechuan shrimp and spring roll on rice. 

Noodle Soup:
The noodles were served in a hot broth that was flavourful and not too salty. Unfortunately the noodles were over cooked. The soup had 3 pieces of broccoli and served with 5 generous pieces of fried fish. The batter on the fish was light yet crunch and the fish was cooked perfectly. 

Szechuan Shrimp
Huge portion served with red peppers, broccoli, onions, with rice and a spring roll. 
It was a little on the saucy side but was very tasty. 

Overall a good place and will def be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Located in the metro square food court, this place offers Hong Kong style foods. I got the cheese spaghetti and foukin fried rice. They were both okay, nothing special. It's super cheap though and they give you a generous amount of food. Food is made and packed quick for take out. With a purchase of a meal you can get soy milk, pop or Chinese soup. With an extra dollar, you can get cold lemon tea. If you want just cold lemon tea, it's $2. This place only accepts cash!"}
{"text":"It was better 10 years ago...which was the last time I ate here. Came here to give my curry chicken and rice dish another go since I got hit with a case of nostalgia. I left with much disappointment. The sauce didn't have much curry flavour and it was only spicy because they put a heck of a lot of pepper in it. There is more onion than anything else in the entire dish. Few small shreds of chicken and lots of gooey sauce. I mean it did only cost $7 (including tax) and we are talking about food court food here, but I must say there are better ways to spend $7. Oh yes, and the meal comes with your choice of soup, soya milk, pop, or water. I got the soup, which was alright and luckily not too salty. 

Only pleasant surprise was the 2 musicians performing in the food court that day. There was a lady on the violin and a gentleman on guitar. They were amazing! :)"}
