{"text":"The Washington Street Diner was among those listed in Cleveland Magazine's \"Diners of Cleveland\" edition from late 2010.  We have been trying to make the rounds of the restaurants in that article, and one Sunday in February, we made it there.  I suppose if you live in the neighborhood, there's no reason not to go there.  They did standard breakfast fare at a very reasonable price, but there's also nothing great about it; I believe we got out of there for about $20 including a 15% tip.  I'm not giving it two stars because it's horrible food, but like Yelp says, \"Meh, I've had better.\"  The interior is rather stark, with almost no wall decor or art.  The service was relatively slow, and it seemed like they might have been understaffed.  I got the corned beef hash, which they said was made on site.  It was perfectly fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.  My partner had the French toast, and that was rather disappointing.  Firstly it looked like it might have come out of an industrial sized case of pre-frozen French toast ... it appeared tobe a perfectly sliced piece of extra thick Wonder Bread that was just too perfectly, cleanly battered.  And it came to the table barely warm; the butter on the table wouldn't even melt on it.  Another complaint of mine is that there was no real cream on the table.  They had little pre-packaged blister-packs of something like Coffee Mate or some other non-dairy creamer.  I did find out that they have real cream available in the back if you ask for it, so remember that.  I want to say more, but the restaurant was so plain and the food was so minimally impressive, that it's only been a few days since that meal, and I can barely remember anything more than a vague sense of disappointment."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and coffee! Can get crowded on a Sunday morning but the line moves quick. The omelets are big and amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some breakfast on a Sunday morning.  Nothing fancy, just standard breakfast fare inside a small establishment.  I had half of a Belgian waffle with eggs and bacon along with a coffee and an orange juice.  Service is great and the food is as well.  Definitely a good go to spot that is nice and close to home."}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered breakfast here so i can't speak to the rest of their menu. However, if I'm going out for breakfast this is where I always end up. Food is quick and the service is spot on. Great French toast, you have to ask for real maple syrup, but they do have it. If I'm not getting french toast I usually get something with home fries. never both at the same time cuz that would be too much food."}
{"text":"My favorite local diner!   Their corned beef hash is to die for and my kids love the giant pancakes.  Great for your basic diner breakfast.    It's always crowded on weekends so plan a short wait as it's a smallish spot with tight tables and seating.  If you have a party of more than 4 on the weekend plan to sit at 2 or more tables or plan to wait for a while."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here because we where nextdoor at the medical center. This is just the kind of gem I love to find. We had a wonderful breakfast and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"The usual breakfast offerings...what sets this place apart for me is the staff. Friendly, happy, prompt and competent. If you need to order breakfast for your office or a group, call ahead for their bacon, egg and cheese english muffins --- they're awesome."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was slow. It would be very hard to get in and out in an hour lunch break. If you have extra time it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Washington Street Diner is my staple breakfast place.  It is clean, the staff is really friendly and the menu and pricing is exactly what it should be for a diner.    My favorite items are the omelettes and the breakfast wraps.  When I am not watching what I eat, the potato pancakes are amazing.  If you like spice even in the morning, they have the New Orleans omelette and the Cajun wrap that features a spicy Cajun sausage that I love.   If it is lunch time, my favorite is the American Wrap.    The only slight negative to the place is the speed of service which is a bit inconsistent.  Most times I have no problems getting in and out in a reasonable amount of time, but once in a while the food will come out a bit slowly.  Even still, the food and the employees are so good that an occasionally slow meal is no big deal.  I would send anybody to this place."}
{"text":"A real diner!! Good food in a busy casual atmosphere of friends and families who like real cooking.  A regular clientele keeps the tables full at peak hours."}
{"text":"Sure, diner food can only get so good. But this diner sure does make up for the average food with their portion sizes, prices, and servers. Very prompt, tasty enough, friendly service. Can't complain, it's a good local diner to grab lunch at! Don't expect to have good cell reception though... Absolute dead zone."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for heavy, greasy, disgustingly delicious breakfast!  I always get the eye opener sandwich and my mom gets the breakfast wrap.  Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Such good food!!!! And friendly staff!   I have been to this diner many times as I've lived in Bainbridge almost my whole life. It's always been great and had fast turnover on busy weekend mornings.  Finally, I got to come back here after not having been in a long time and it was still just as good. The food is clearly made to order and fresh. My hash browns were homemade and just like my grandmother's, sliced and fried with a little bit of seasoning. The coffee was good too.   My boyfriend had a buffalo chicken wrap that he said was excellent. Washington Street Diner definitely doesn't disappoint in the breakfast OR lunch options. The menu itself is pretty large and has a great selection.   Staff was very friendly, as said before, and made the experience fast and welcoming. We love this place and will come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef hash in Ohio!  Be sure to get it with a couple of poached eggs. Friendly and courteous waitstaff and food is consistently delicious. Philadelphia steak sandwich \"wit\" is as good as anything you will find in Philly. Havent had a bad meal yet and i eat there 5 days a week and have for several years. Dan is the owner and is a great personality!  And dont miss the soups!  All are good but both the Tomato and Cream of Mushroom are amazing!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop here on my way to my sons football game. I ordered the steak and eggs. I passed the homefries to my hubby and he said they were very good. The steak was just ok for me. It was cooked well but under seasoned. I wish I would have thought to add sauteed onions and peppers to my dish. It would have really taken this dish to the next level. The waitress was very friendly. The food came out in a timely manner. Great little place."}
