{"text":"Come on guys 18.00 per person for the prix fixe appetizer for a table of four was total robbery. We were so angry when we left your establishment. We received 4 small servings of chef choice appetizers and a schmear of hummus. We had to order the bread basket in addition to this.  We were lead to believe that by ordering the apps for  
4 the servings would be generous, but they were not. At the end of the day our bill  was 135.32...tip, bread, 3 drinks and apps. 
We are frequents of Montreal and have dined in many restaurants and have been repeat customers to many..things will have to change dramatically for us to return to this one."}
{"text":"One of my spots to check out for my summer bucket list, I decided to venture out solo to check out this Underground Moroccan palace.

Brightly decorated with Moroccan lanterns and lush tapestry pillows, with mellowed out music in the background- made me feel as if I was in Marrakesh. 
Seating was spacious housing easily 40+ ppl sided with a stylish bar. There is a small terasse in the back with around 10 tables beautifully dressed in white linens. 

I enjoyed the presentation of the menu - listing a choice of cocktails, bar bites, salad, risotto and main dishes ranging between -12 to 40$ per dish. There is a 5 appetizer sampler dish for 18$ / person that allows you to try an array of their salads. 

I decided to order a cocktail Dec with  cardamom syrup, fig based, bourbon- I was on cloud 9 - so original. The beef tartar was beautifully presented- had a little kick to it -served with homemade chips and fragrant salad. I also ordered the couscous risotto that was quite appetizing and not too heavy. The portions were great. 

Chef Dan Medalsy and his team were divine, highly commended service. I look forward to coming back and trying more Morrocan delights!"}
{"text":"**BEWARE OF HIDDEN CHARGES AND UPCHARGING **

I've never had Morrocan food before so trying this place downtown was pretty exciting. We opt for a tasting menu for two at $18/person. I really wanted to try the Israeli couscous, but the waiter told us the tasting menu has a bit of everything and it's usually served as the chef's choice. 

Good: The dishes were served in a platter in 4 small bowls. I was initially taken about and though 'is this  the first course or is that all of it?', but it turns out to be a decent amount. The carrot salad and hummus were stand outs for me. I usually dislike carrots but this one was incredible, lots of flavor. The hummus tasted really fresh and I only wish there was more. The bread basket came with a thin crispy crepe thing that was so tasty, but it also came with a not so tasty sesame bun. 

Bad: When we ordered our food, the waiter asked if we wanted bread so we said yes. We later found out the bread was an additional $4...what the heck? No mention of an extra cost? How are we suppose to eat our hummus WITHOUT bread? By the spoonfuls? In our salad?  Anyways, I couldn't help but feel ripped off that we're being charged something that should've been included in our meal. Service was also a bit slow, considering it was a Thursday at 7pm and there was only 4-5 ocupied tables in the room. 

Bottom line: If I am completely honest, you can just buy half of the same food at Adonis and serve it on a fancy platter at half the price. I didn't think the tasting menu was worth the money, and especially after that bread basket scam. I am not a fan of this place.

*UPDATE* : When I originally opt for the Discovery menu, I remember seeing it was $16 per person so it should've been $32 for 2 people, but upon inspecting the receipt, it was actually charged $36 for the Discovery menu. I didn't flag this to our waiter at first because I thought I've might've read it wrong since it was kind of dim inside. If you read other blogs and look at their actual menu, you'll see that it's actually $16. So be vigilant about looking at the menu here and call them out if they over charge you. Wow, I can't believe business like this could be so shady. I know it's only $4 more, but that's still a pretty crummy thing for a restaurant to do."}
{"text":"The evening started well, nice decor and the waitresses were friendly at first but then things turned sour: 1 hour after ordering, still no food. When the food came, the portion were either so small for the price (24$ for 4 shrimps on some pasta main course but looking like an appetizer portion) or way too salty (three tiny oversalted skewers came - inedible). We wanted bread but we were told it's an extra 4$ /portion and an extra 8 minute wait (we had already waited 1 hour). A friend who had asked to substitute one of the sides to couscous was brought an additional dish and blamed by the waitress for ordering it, although she had not clarified the substitution would actually be an additional dish and therefore be charged as an extra. When we complained about the quality of the food, the wait and everything else, the senior staff gave us a condescendant speech about Moroccan food and how the meat was salted for 30 days and that's the way it is (we were actually with a Moroccan who had never seen such small or salty portions in her life). They are definitely not open to feedback and at the cost of that tiny and over-salted meal, you can definitely get much better anywhere else in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Ok.  I don't know where to start with bad. The treatment in this place was horrendous. The waiter was nice.  However, the bar was not even close to fully stocked. I had to change my drink order three times before I just ordered vodka on the rocks with a lime wedge. They didn't even have lime. The restaurant was empty and even we booked our group of nine, they did not say we would be forced to have the sampling menu. I didn't want their sampling menu. They refused to serve us from the regular menu and actually let us leave despite being empty.

Stay away."}
{"text":"* HAIR IN FOOD*

The service here was some of the worst I have experienced. The staff were not at all service-oriented and were rude throughout our entire dining experience. Additionally, we discovered two hairs in our tagine, and not only did we not received any apology, but the staff also insinuated the hair was from us (even though we pulled it out from the middle of our food immediately upon its arrival). The food (aside from the hair...) was fine but nothing noteworthy. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I planned a Friday lunch and decided to try this recently opened place out.

The food itself, though pricy, was pretty good. But they missed their mark for speed and service (crucial for workday lunch), by a mile.

We arrived at 11:45, ordered swiftly and was very clear that some of us needed to leave in an hour due to meetings scheduled. At 12:45 We we were still waiting for our dishes - three burgers and two fish of the day.

During the entire lunch period, there were only two tables being served: a table of 2 and our table of 5.

When we inquired, the only thing our waitress said to us was: food is coming and sorry but there's not much I can do.

Don't think I'll ever come back for lunch on a weekday..."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous when a friend booked a reservation here due to the reviews which I don't always rely on & I was happy I followed my gut instinct on this one! I would like to point out that they are no longer open during lunch hours. This is a place you go to enjoy an amazing meal without having to rush.

The decor is beautiful & welcoming as was the staff. I started off with a Tangier pimm's & it was delicious & refreshing. My friend ordered the casapolitain & it was hella more enjoyable than a regular cosmo, not as sweet & quite refreshing.

I have a serious allergy to a particular ingredient & they were extremely accommodating. Everything is made fresh on premise, breads included.  We ordered the 5 appetizers salads, hummus,bell pepper with walnuts, roasted eggplant,beets & carrot salad), 2 fixed priced mains & I had the braised beef tangia.

When I get salads, I always tend to prefer 1 or 2 but I loved all of them equally. They were served with warm muffaletta & a delicious crepe style bread. My friend & my beloved shared the chicken tagine & they loved it, I would have tried some but I preferred not ending up in the hospital (I pick & choose my battles!). It came with a mixed vegetable coucous. I ordered the braised beef tangine, it was so tender, flavourful & amazing. Since they can't cook it like they would in Morocco, they use the sous vide technic & it works beautifully. We were full by this point but we had desserts still coming, we couldn't let them go to waste, right?

The lemon pie was made with a Moroccan almond cookie base & hard meringues, that lemon curd is to die for. The chocolate kif was also lovely. My least favourite was the spiced milk pot, the texture is silky but I'm not an anise fan. The presentation of all the dishes was lovely.

I'll be back & bring a few friends with me!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service good.  I also enjoyed the quiet pleasant atmosphere. Such a change from the noise in most restaurants."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Moroccan food in the city. At Tangia, they bring a level of refinement to Moroccan food! Service is exceptional and the starting salads are unreal!"}
{"text":"I came here with my colleagues on a Thursday night. We did the tasting menu which was $45 per person. It started off as a promising night but then things took a turn for the worse...

When I arrived I ordered the Fez Fig cocktail which to me tasted similar to a bourbon lemonade. It's definitely my kind of drink!! It contained figs, bourbon, Mahia (Moroccan spirit) and cardamom syrup. My boyfriend ordered the Marrakschi Mojito which tasted like mint tea. I liked it. It was very light and refreshing but you couldn't really taste the alcohol so my boyfriend didn't like his drink. Luckily our colleague liked it and took his cocktail. We then ordered a bottle of red Spanish wine (Conde Valdemar).

We were served a 5 appetizer platter which consisted of carrot salad, hummus, bell pepper salad, eggplant salad and a tomato cucumber salad. The carrot salad and the bell pepper salads were my favorite. It was so good! However, I didn't like the hummus and I usually love hummus! I also regret to say that I didn't like the eggplant salad because it had honey in it so it was sweet...think babaganouj but with honey. I'm sure people who like honey would enjoy this appetizer but I do not like it when my food is sweet. The tomato cucumber salad was simple and refreshing. It came with pita bread and a round loaf of bread. The pita bread was warm and thin and reminded me of a roti cut in triangles. It was so good my colleague ordered another round of pita bread for the table.

Then we were served a meatball tagine and a chicken tagine. The meatball tagine was pretty good. It was like something you could put on spaghetti. The chicken tagine was even better. It had tasty potatoes and olives. We ate the tagines with couscous. The sauce came separately and it made the couscous taste so much better.

Lastly, we had the mint tea and the dessert platter. The mint tea was not included in the tasting menu. I just love mint tea! The downside was that the waiter charged everyone $3.75 for the mint tea which individually seems reasonable but if I do the math it came out to almost $49 for the table for hot water and mint in three teapots! that's pricy!!

The dessert platter had three different types of dessert but the waitress didn't explain what it was. One resembled a lemon meringue pie but more bitter ( I did not like this one), the other one had pieces of brownie and lastly there was chocolate cake cut up in pieces. The latter was my favorite out of the three.

At the end of the meal we were given our bills. First of all, there was only one machine for the whole restaurant! They obviously need to get more cause it was long! Second, they charged us for bread but it was so random because some people did not get charged at all, whereas a colleague and I got charged $2 and another got charged $6!! How expensive was this pita bread?! Its nowhere on the menu. We thought it was included with the meal! We should have been informed at the beginning that it would cost extra. Lastly, the owner was rude when we told him that the bottles of chardonnay that he served normally cost $8.50/bottle at the SAQ. He was charging $60/bottle! I mean come on! That's a crazy markup! I don't normally check how much a bottle would cost at the SAQ but I tried the wine and I liked it but my boyfriend and I wanted to order red wine instead so my boyfriend looked it up online so that we could buy it at the SAQ later and drink it another time. This particular bottle wasn't even on the wine menu. It was a good Chardonnay though so if you are in the market for a cheap one get the Cesari Adesso Chardonnay 2014! Honestly I feel like the owner could have handled the situation better and it left a bitter taste in my mouth. We informed him so that in the future he could change the price because a wine connoisseur would know that it wasn't worth $60. There was a lot of back and forth and in the end two people were not charged for their bottle but the owner told them never to return to the restaurant again! The bottle of red wine that we ordered cost us $50 and it's $19.95 at the SAQ so that was reasonable. 

I would have given this restaurant four stars because I liked the drinks and I liked most of the food. The portions were a good size. Also the décor was elegant. However, I find it pricey for what we got and the unpleasant service and experience we had is making me give it 2 stars. They should really consider lowering the price and be nicer to their customers. I'm sorry to say that I would not come back."}
{"text":"I felt like I was right back in Morocco! The menu is full of familiar favorites like tagines (chicken and olive was just as delicious here as it was on a rooftop in Fez) and pastilla (with chicken instead of pigeon). Portions were perfect and we felt like we could sample a variety of things without feeling overstuffed. One of my companions said the mother-in-law's harira was the best soup she'd ever had. The pot de crème and cinnamon oranges were a sweet ending to a lovely night. Highly recommend - Montréal is lucky to have such an authentic Moroccan restaurant."}
