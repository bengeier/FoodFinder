{"text":"Love this place! Wait staff is very nice and friendly. Food is exceptional! Been through a lot of Korean BBQ restaurants and Hansik is my favourite. 
Nice atmosphere with minimal children and loud people.
For newbies and amateur korean BBQ foodies, make sure to allow an hour to eat before closing time. (to avoid your feelings and ego from being damaged, wah wah.
Flamboyant or not, it does not affect the food and only enhances the dining experience.)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and attentive service. Been here 3 times so far and will make it one of my regular restaurants."}
{"text":"My family and i went here last Christmas when it first opened up. Had a great  experience with the course  menu.  Awesome food prepared by a chef from korea with plenty of food and the course  was $35 per person. 

Came back here for mothers day ordered the same course and it was a horrific experience. The ownership must have changed along with the chef. Made reservations, so we sat down right away.. waited 10 minutes to order and it wasn't even that  busy, they had four servers,  which seemed plenty given the size of the restaurant which isn't huge. It took another 15 minutes for the food to start and after a few plates there was a 20 minutes pause in our course and we asked several times what the hold up is and they just kept saying sorry we're busy. They were not under-staffed or overly busy. The manager just dies not know how to run the restaurant.

By the end we just  wanted to leave, the food went down in quality since opening up, the service was a nightmare and the food is over priced. I am very easy going with food and servers but this place is over hyped by the other reviews. Do not, i repeat, do not dine here."}
{"text":"very nice restaurant.. Come here often after balling at hoopdome.  Wish they had that korean chicken soup though..

Great service and an affordable price with generous portions."}
{"text":"Came her for a dinner to try a new place.

The moment we walked in we were greeted with very friendly service, walked us through the menu and checked up on us I would say almost every 5 minutes. The food was above average in my opinion, but the service was really what blew me away.

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food here is below average. I ordered a stew with pork. Very bland and watered down. My other friends had an okay time here.

Edit: I know I only have one review but this place was that bad that I had to make an account and write this. So trust me."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant for the first time. It is spacious and looks trendy. I came with a party of 6. Ordered some table cooking dishes and some other hot dishes. It seems like only one waiter serving all the tables at this restaurant. Even though it does not look very busy to me, I mean not all the tables are occupied. What I wanted to say is the service is slow. 

The seafood pancake does have a lot of seafood chunks. But it's a bit tasteless. The pork belly and the ribeye steaks look good and they are well marinated. They taste delicious. The spicy chicken hot stone pot came last. The portion is not big. It didn't come with the hot and sweet sauce until we asked for several times. 

I probably won't come back again due to long travelling distance and the unsatisfactory service."}
{"text":"Can someone explain how the group pork bone soup for $13.99 per person works? There was three of us and we get a pot to split amongst us and when we asked for another serving they said that's all we get. If that was all we \"get\" wouldn't it be cheaper if we each got our own little stone pots of pork bone stew? Can someone math wtf went wrong there? They were also pretty petty because we didn't tip them after that experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the most random area. 
Came trying to have the course meal but you need to give one or two days notice which I find Absolutely ridiculous. 

I've had their cheese bibimbap and dumplings and did not enjoy. 
Oh and their kang poongi was not good. It was clearly double fried and the sauce mix wasn't good. 

Service wasn't pleasant and the side dishes weren't fresh either. Me and my boyfriend were the only customers at the restaurant so that was awkward too."}
{"text":"It's a definitely a hidden gem on finch & dufferin, tried lots of Korean restaurants in north York, this one is definitely in top 3! Surprised by the quality of food and ppl here r really friendly. Will come back for sure. 5 star for the food and service but 3 star for location, so 4 star on average...."}
{"text":"Came one Friday evening around 6:30 and it was fairly quiet. There was one large party of about 8ppl. Right away, after ordering we were served Korean side dishes. Because the heater was broken, they gave us complementary congee (how sweet!)

The inside is clean and spacious. There's a really authentic Korean atmosphere. Ample parking.

I hear the cart rolling and I'm like 'What?! Food already?' The service was so fast. And the servings were generous. We ordered a green dragon roll, spicy pork, and bulgogi stone bowls. The spicy pork wasn't too spicy. The only thing I could say was...more meat would have been nice.

Ten green dragon rolls (giant ones); delicious! Couldn't even finish my stone bowl. But boy, I'm excited to take the leftovers to go and eat it tomorrow. I'd love to come back for lunch one day (their bento boxes look very reasonable)."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in the unfamiliar territory of North York, with nothing but food on the mind. We put our faith in local reviews and headed for Hansik Korean Restaurant. To be honest, I was a little concerned with our choice when we got there, because neighbouring it are a rug cleaning store and an adult video store, but boy did that food prove me wrong!

As you walk into the restaurant you get a feel for its mellow tones and classy feel, with its auburn wood panelled booths. You'll also see a couple tables outfitted for Korean BBQ, though we didn't partake in that on this occasion.
Before our meal came we got the welcome surprise of endless banchan, which is Korean appetizers typically served with rice. This included sweet soy beans, miso soup, stewed potatoes in a sweet sauce, kimchi, and likely one or two other items. They were all plenty tasty and kept us delightfully content while we waited for our meals, (especially since they were free).
Then came the main; bibimbap. No, that isn't a typo, nor a word that I made up. Bibimbap is a Korean word that literally means \"mixed rice\". There are host of different ingredients that you can put in a bibimbap, but this bulgogi bibimbap featured carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts, greens, grilled marinated beef, an egg, sesame seeds, white rice, and their mystery seasonings. I won't be so bold as to say that this dish was legendary or a show stopper, but it was good enough to at least have you pose the question. My love affair started when the bibimbap was served steaming in a bowl too hot to handle by hand. Then you get to break the single egg yolk perched atop the supple marinated beef (bulgogi), and avail yourself to whatever section of the bowl that you fancy, as each of the main toppings occupy their personal section. Add a little bit of their special bibimbap sauce for extra spice of fun, and you'll be in business.

We all had some form of bibimbap, so I can't speak to the rest of the dishes, but as far as I'm concerned, Hansik does it right. GO!
(By the way, the staff were swell :) )"}
{"text":"Look to the right at the store times.

Does it say 10:00 pm?

Tell me why I arrive at 9:15pm and before I could get to the second door- we get stopped by a very flamboyant young man. Hand gestures and everything- telling me that its closed. When I told him that online it says 10pm- he said . Sorry!! very sarcastically and continued with his hand waving like his at a rave or practicing his pom pom routine for cheerleader school.

In all fairness- if a restaurant is not busy and it was completely dead. Makes sense to close down early- however there is a way to present it.

To make it worse- there was two people (assuming its management and another server) at the front where I guess the host stands who found it very funny at how the Korean version of Richard Simmons was waving his hands around to prevent us from entering. That added salt to my wounds. To be fair- to look back at it, I do find his eccentric behaviour a little bit funny. 

However- I'm not hungry and craving some kalbi beef  right now am I ? 

You lost one Hansik- before it even started!"}
{"text":"This is in the most random plaza  at dufferin and finch. But despite its location, their food is delicious.

We ordered their tangsooyuk and for main, I had their chirashi (sashimi bowl) and my bf had their eel rice. I know...we both chose Japanese food even though we were at a Korean restaurant.

Their tangsooyuk is probably one of the best I've had. Crispy and full of flavour. They also added bits of apple into their cooking. I thought my chirashi bowl was a pretty big portion, so it was well worth it. 

The restaurant is relatively quiet with the TV playing, even with groups of people. If you prefer to eat in peace, come here!"}
{"text":"I've visited here when they first opened a couple of years ago. Recently had another meal there, and wasn't impressed then and not impressed now. 

Had a $15 L.A Kalbi lunch box and I came out hungry.  The meat seemed like it was boiled rather than grilled. 1 out of 4 pieces was just grease, so all I could eat were 3 little pieces of bland meat and dumplings.  I only had half the rice because there was nothing else to eat with.

The place is clean and service is good, but the food is Meh."}
{"text":"We were here for a birthday.  The flavours were different than what's I've become accustomed to at other Korean restaurants... mostly in Finch and Yonge and Steeles and Yonge area... as well as other Korean restaurants in other cities.  A nice surprise was the k-pop chicken... its was a bit spicy and sweet. My usual favorite Galbi was only ok and for 300g was expensive ($29).  We also had a stuffed shrimp dish where the shrimp was not fresh... the meat clung to the shell and had the wrong texture.  Service was good and the server was attentive.  We weren't familiar with the menu which may have contributed to our lack luster experience."}
{"text":"This is an excellent, authentic Korean restaurant. 
We came in for lunch and the service was outstanding, they gave us some cold Korean tea, 4 different plates of Korean tapas like kimchi and others who I don't know their names. 
The food came fast and the servings are huge. 
Neither me nor my wife were able to finish our food and took it away. 
It is not cheap with average dish for about $12 but it's worth it. 
I wish they had some lunch specials but still worth it. 
Will come again."}
{"text":"Horrible service for their private party room. occasion was for a private party for a dinner for 150-200 people. they were given notice the night before, it was going to be a set meal of three simple items: bibimbap, soon tofu soup, and spicy beef soup. they assigned two waiters, and the food came out over a space of two hours!!! would not recommend for large parties."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday party. We had a large group so we had a private room to ourselves. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived at 6. They have a good list of Korean dishes along with Japanese sushi rolls with reasonable prices. I ordered the Bulgogi bibibamp and the spicy salmon roll. It was nicely presented but the taste was off the mark. It lacked some salt so this dish really fell flat for me. Adding the special sauce helped a bit but it definitely need salt to make it taste good. The spicy salmon roll was cold which was definitely not right as the roll should be warm but it tasted like it was taken out of the freezer still half frozen. Although the taste was there, it did not taste that great.  Overall, a decent restaurant. Staff are friendly and nice. I think the restaurant was okay for me. Wasn't the best Korean meal I ever had but would consider coming back to give them another chance.  I haven't tried their AYCE Korean BBQ but wouldn't mind coming back to try that."}
{"text":"Very delicious food here. Got the spicy pork hot stone pot and the chicken katsu which were both amazing. Definitely recommend this place to eat out. The servers were nice. Recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Korean apeitizers are plentiful and taste good.  This Is a BBQ place with the cook top grill.  So definitely needed to try that. Pretty good marinated beef ribs.  The service was very friendly to say the least.  The server recommend dishes and checked on out table quite often, maybe because the restaurant was not full for a Saturday night dinner.  Parking is ample in the plaza."}
{"text":"Came her for Christmas day. I really enjoyed the fact they were open on Christmas day.

My family ordered the bbq surf and turf with other entrees (cold noodle soup, porridge and bibimbap).

The quality of the meat and seafood were oustanding. Service was amazing. There were two servers for 8 people party. They were very attentive and cooked the meat for us so that it would be done properly and was it ever delicious!  I didn't try the other entrees because I love my meat I focused on the bbq. The people in my party did enjoy their meals from the way it seemed since everyone's bowls very empty at the end. Their banchan (side dishes) were fresh, tasty and had a lot of different varieties (bottomless)!

I really enjoyed this place but alas it's at the other end of the city from where I live. If I'm ever in the area or its a special event I will definitely make it a mission to go back."}
{"text":"One word. BAD SERVICE!
Party of 5 went to do korean table BBQ on Thursday around 7pm.
I picked this restaurant to serve my non korean coworkers, including my director to offer them a good korean bbq experience. IT WAS MY MISTAKE to choose this place.
Servers were never around  when we needed them, like as if they were playing hide & seek on us. If we were ever lucky to find one of them, we would have to ask more then twice for the things we need. (I speak fluent korean, therefore it's not the matter of miscommunication I suppose).  Bbq setting was so tricky that we weren't able to control it our selves. Our meat on the grill started to burn. Of course no servers around. They made sure they hide some where we cannot find them easily. By the time we were able to grab one of the server, meats were already burnt out.
They never bother to replace our grill pan.
A typical korean restaurant will serve a little dessert at the end of the meal, like they offer side dishes for free, so i expected that. I asked server if we will get some dessert. We were told, yes we can get dessert but we have to pay for it. Wow! Really?? There are dozens of korean restaurants in the GTA area and I've never visited one where i had to pay extra for the dessert! Over all, very pricey place compare to the service you get. Never going back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This place is a GEM!  My husband, my adult kids, and I LOVE Korean food. This is as good as it gets. The food was excellent and plentiful, the service was fast and thoughtful. We are delighted!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the blogTO review. Was very disappointed in their menu as the review boasted a traditional and modern view on korean cooking. I did not try their tasting menu....but most of the items on the menu were the regular traditional korean dishes you would find in any other korean restaurant - except it was more on the pricey side.

My friend and I went at 830pm on a Saturday night - restaurant was empty. Maybe 3 tables and a party in the back room. Not a whole lot of wait staff - so service was not that great. My friend ordered the bulgogi bimbimbap...and I had the baby octopus bimbimbap...and we shared the sake beef tartare. The beef tartare was actually good - big portion - but was also $20. My baby octopus was rubbery and had no flavour to it. We had tea, asked for water - was given a water jug but no glasses. Had to wait a very long time to try to get the attention of the wait staff. Eventually I gave up and just drank water in my tea cup. As soon as we were done eating we wanted to pay and get the heck out. We also had to wait a long time to get the attention of staff for the bill. Eventually I had to stand up to get someone's attention.

This place is below ordinary and expensive. Should have gone to my usual korean spots - they never disappoint."}
{"text":"AMAZING KBBQ AYCE. The price is very reasonable and you get huge portions. I mean; amongst my bf and I for $50 you get AYCE meat which includes sushi and soup. The only downfall is that it has poor ventilation and you will smell like bbq from head to toe."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Saturday. Been here before but menu has slightly changed recently! The restaurant is still very clean and maintained, a detail I personally deeply appreciated. No heavy smoke smells that often happen with Korean restaurants over time. We ordered, enjoyed our food and received decent service. Clean, simple, not crazy expensive, good food and service. Me: gamjatang (pork bone soup) Him: lunch bento box"}
{"text":"I've been a few times for lunch. Place isn't bad. 

First thing. It pays off rolling into the restaurant with a Korean friend who can communicate effectively with the staff. 
A group that would represent like the United Nations rolled in w/o our K-Town friend.. Ordered a couple bento boxes, soups etc.. we weren't served any bancha(?)
The return trips with a Korean friend, we got the works, plus other little side dishes I've never had before AND some stuff off the menu.
Pork Bone soup, the bento boxes and the AYCE BBQ lunch are all worth the shot. 

Full stomach, happy heart, got me dancing like Psy 
oooop, oooop, ooooop oooop."}
{"text":"Very good food! Authentic and the service really makes you feel like a king. They make sure everything is going well by checking often and making sure we are satisfied. I came during christmas and the employee was even singing. It just gave me the impression that people who work here genuinely enjoy it here which makes it an enjoyable environment to have a meal in as well."}
{"text":"I am Korean and I must say that this place has the authentic taste of Korea! 

I took my friends(not Korean) to this place, since they have never tasted Korean cuisine. It was recommended by a group of Korean people that I knew, so I had a good feeling about this place.

The service: Attentive, helpful, kind. The servers greeted us right away, answered any questions about the menu, came by to check on us while we ate, followed up on our requests(e.g. water, more rice) quickly, came by to take empty dishes after our meal. 

The food: I had Seafood Soon Tofu (comes with rice) and my friends had spicy chicken with vegetables (comes with rice). The Soon Tofu was a little spicy, the broth was smooth, the tofu was warm, just the way it should be. The spicy chicken was hot, moist, and chewy. Yum! 

My friends loved this place and so did I! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Korean food and restaurant. Both times I've been here it's been pretty quiet. The service is great. I would recommend getting their crispy chicken (sweet and sour sauce) and their bimbimbap."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this place as we were driving by and we were in for a great surprise! The menu was HUGE and has a great variety of Korean dishes. From kbbq to cold noodles, they've got it all! The food was delicious and service was amazing. Staff was extremely attentive to make sure we had the best dining experience possible. I think that it's because this place is also a banquet hall (even though it doesn't really look like it inside) so staff was trained to deliver exceptional service. 

The prices were average, like any other typical Korean diners, but what surprised us was the inexpensive all you can eat Korean bbq! I believe for lunch it was around $15 and for dinner, less than $25? Whatever the price was, it was much less than Chako or other AYCE kbbq. We will definitely be back to try out the kbbq. 

I'm giving it 4 stars not 5 because the banchan's (or side dishes) were not as great as other places and they only gave 3. Usually as a starter I would expect it to be diverse like other places!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, big selection. My friend and I shared some tempura vegetables and we both got bibimbap. I got the beef one, it is a lot of food for the price! They also give you salad, miso soup, other sidings like kimchi. The service was very friendly and attentive, constantly refilling our water and checking up on us. Would definitely go back again and try some other things."}
{"text":"I want to give them a better rating because the food was good. Although the all you can eat did not come with the proper sides or sauces for dipping. Our waiter barely understood English so it was really hard to order or get things right. The BBQ meats were nicely marinated but without the proper service and condiments it was difficult to give them more stars."}
