{"text":"I love how home cooked food tastes from a clean deli.   The sandwiches are very tasty if you are in a hurry. Grab some beer, they even have unique brews. Make an order for parties, clam bakes, or your next bar mitzvah! I ordered the chef's choice and it did not disappoint. We love the clam bakes and for a great, affordable, quick and easy dinner - get in and out of there in less the 10 minutes and the family will high five you. Great food, great staff. Don't forget the egg scrambler for breakfast."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for lunch. Everything is always fresh and good.  Great sandwiches.  Prices are very fair on sandwiches and hot food."}
{"text":"Update: They Gyro is no longer available for $5...too bad. The guy who seems to be in charge, possibly the store manager (the little pudgy guy who wears glasses) is rather rude and unfriendly. He's rather unpleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"I just can't give more than two stars. When I think Deli I think homemade. Things no one else in the area makes better. Pre made deli sandwiches are a real turn off! What's wrong with made as ordered. Homemade potato and macaroni salads I can get the same thing at Giant Eagle. Their bakery is all frozen, nothing homemade. Their roast chickens are good but I can get those at Giant Eagle too. I just don't see what is so special about this Deli. Sorry I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a underwhelming experience. The most shocking thing was the expensive price tag on a lot of the items here. The BBQ sandwich was not great and we tried to get creative to do something with the sandwich when we got home because there was very little flavor. The soups were around $5 for a small container. I don't mind spending that when it's homemade but this stuff is not that. I wanted more out of this place..."}
{"text":"This corner deli has anything you could ever want, including semi-famous pizza rolls. They have affordable family meals for take-out too.   I have had them cater a professional event that we held outside. They sent 2 men in a Suburban and within minutes they were set up, grilling chicken and ribs. The team was super nice, fun, and eager to help."}
{"text":"Great Deli and the neighborhood where it's located is fortunate to have them.  I had one of their sandwiches and I liked the fact that I could find a sandwich that was a normal size.  I'm confused with one poster which indicated prepared sandwiches are not ideal; I can get prepared sandwiches at one of the conglomerate supermarket chains down the road at about the same price.....so I'm happy to pay the price to support a local business owner, as long as it's fresh and doesn't send me to the hospital.  I also had their coleslaw; a little on the crunchy side (fresh and a good thing) and just a tad of sweetness, all very tasty with my sandwich.  Yes, they stock some name brands at a higher price, but that offers some variety in the store.  Otherwise it would be a boring place.  The cashier is friendly and talked me through the selection of fresh brewed coffees.  She even prepared a fresh pot of coffee for me to try.  I usually prefer dark roasts but she explained their own blend to me.  I tried the fresh brewed Martin's blend and it was very good.  I could taste the various types of coffee in the blend which made for a nice afternoon coffee for after the meal.  It seems that some thought went into that blend and they have a good formula.  The guys behind the deli cases reminded me of the deli shop my mother would send me to get meat down the street here in Westlake back in the days.....yes there were Delis out in the western suburbs 40 and 50 years ago.  I also like their seating in a step down area just off to the side, so away from the bustle of the deli cases and rambling customers.  There is a TV on the wall which is inviting and they provide wi-fi service. I'd like to try from their wine selection, maybe another post."}
{"text":"The food is mostly tasty. The service is consistently poor. I frequently stop at all of their locations and have never come across a happy or kind employee. They always seem pissed off.  They do nickel and dime everything down to the amount of pickles hour aloud to put on a sandwich. I'll keep going for the food but the owner should maybe try some team building or infuse some positive energy into his employees."}
{"text":"I will never go to Martins Deli again. I used to frequent the place for their sandwiches. Every time I went in, the employees always had something negative to say or gave unsolicited advice about the weirdest stuff. Plus they're way too pricey! Not everyone in Bay Village is on that pricey ish!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good. Got a turkey sandwich and a brownie for around 7 bucks. They have deli items (hot soups, warm foods, cold salads, cold cuts, cheeses, a mini frozen foods selection) they also have beer and wine and ice cream. Nothing too impressive, but a good place to stop for lunch or to grab something convenient."}
{"text":"I have to I am really disappointed with Martin's Deli.  I have been going there for years, mainly the one in Bay and its mediocre at best.  I was really surprised to see that there prepared food is from Stouffers, no joke!  One of thier empolyees left a few aluminum tins on the counter that read Stouffers.  If you've had thier prepared food you know what I am talking about, Salsbury Steak, Mac N Cheese, Meatloaf, Mashed Potatoes, chicken and noodles.  I was really disappointed to see this in front of my eyes.    In addition, Martins Deli is also overpriced and they charge your Debit Card 0.35 Cents if you spend less than $10 and don't tell you.  WTF?  However, I guess things could be worse, when I lived in Columbus my main options to get a sandwich were Subway or Jimmy Johns. So I credit them for being family owned.   I will say that there Egg Salad, Rotiserrie Chickens, and Pepporoni Rolls are pretty good."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for just about everything, and they pass off Stouffer's food as their own, although it's just frozen food repackaged.  But the kicker was the thirty-five cent charge for using credit or debit, which they tell their cashiers not to mention unless a customer asks (which I know because the very nervous teenager admitted it when I asked her what it was).  Any place that does that loses my business pronto."}
{"text":"Great deli. I love the hot sandwiches and large selection of wine. the staff is friendly but they are a bit pricey.  The lunch and dinner selections are great for a deli and the rotisserie chicken is great"}
{"text":"I guess if you live near here and frequent the place, it might be decent.  The staff is certainly not friendly to someone who visits occasionally, instead they treat you as an annoyance or interruption to their day.   Without fail, every time I've been in I'm asked \"Can I help you?\" as I'm approaching the hot food section- when I respond that I'll be ready in a minute after I look at the day's selection, the employee *WITHOUT FAIL* then walks off to another part of the store to do some phantom task forcing us to wait several minutes for the person to wander back.  The most recent visit we watched as the cashier didn't answer the ringing store phone while he played on his personal phone.  We listened as employees talk about others including customers.  If you're the slightly overweight 50 something lady with a late model BMW SUV who came in to buy sliced ham and wine over the weekend, they were talking about how much one of your children cheats at (high) school and sleeps around.  The hot food is ok, frequently the roast turkey is too salty.  The little signs instructing you that you can have ONLY 2 pickles per sandwich or 1 tomato etc are petty.  I'm thinking the next time I'm starving in Westlake and don't want to drive I'll get a sandwich and then load up on all of the fixings just to throw them away.  It's a petty place that makes you want to react equally petty.  I'm sure the family that owns the business would be appalled at how their employees conduct themselves."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price, with very friendly employees. They were able to accommodate a special sandwich request, and we're happy to answer all of my questions, since I had never been there before. $6.24 for a toasted tuna sub, small bag of chips, and a can of pop."}
{"text":"Great people with great customer service!  Quite refreshing actually."}
{"text":"I started to visit this deli once I started a new job on Westlake. The employees are always friendly and so willing to help. They always greet you with a smile at the door and in any area they work in. I love the daily specials including the chicken and sandwiches. I love the family atmosphere of this place. I would rather come here then Wendy's. Honestly I always leave happy and I can tell that the employees love their job. Good Job martins in bay!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great neighbor good deli.  The staff is friendly and remembered my name after one visit.  They have great rotisserie chicken and thanksgiving dinner every night! I love their sandwiches, which are different every day.  Martins reminds me of neighborhood delis when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Great little deli that serves excellent meats, cheeses, wines, and sandwiches at great prices. I had their toasted Italian Stallion sandwich and it was very good. This deli is also a lot larger than most and has a lot of selection!"}
{"text":"Martin's Deli is great for a quick lunch or a dinner and a great bottle of wine!! Their chicken salad is amazing and the braided bread goes with every meal."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best clam bake in town. They cater for several local venues and will cater for you at your own party. You can also get \"do it yourself\" packages. They rent you the steamer, give you everything you need including fail proof instructions. People are friendly and professional in the store and if they cater for you. We have done an annual ClamBake with them for years. Highlight is the baked/rotisserie chicken. Not boiled, over cooked rubber chicken you get at other vendors."}
{"text":"Yeah, two stars. Yeah, I'm a regular. Yeah, I'll keep going. Its siren song is just too damn close to my house. Plus, it's not all bad. They have a decent beer selection, an above-average wine selection, and the staff is pretty friendly. And - who am I kidding? - the damn cheap and tasty rotisserie chicken has saved my lazy ass more than a few times when cooking just wasn't appealing. So why two stars? Aside from the alcohol and chicken (my go-to items here) its staples are way overpriced. That wouldn't even bother me if they were better. I've needed a can or bag of something or other for a recipe before and trotted over only to find it unstocked or nasty. We're talking basic stuff here. If the food matched the beer and wine in quality and variety, they'd see a lot more of my money."}
{"text":"I have stopped into Martin's a couple of times now. The sandwiches are good, but nothing to write home about. I ordered a hot turkey sandwich. They are a decent size, and you did get a decent amount for the money. I also ordered the potato salad, which was quite delicious; the macaroni salad is not!   The one problem I have with Martin's is they would not allow me to bring my own bottled water in, which is ridiculous! They do have a nice little dining area where you can enjoy your meal. While we were eating, one of the employees was microwaving the coffee pots in the microwave. I'm glad I didn't order coffee, because I would have been very unhappy to pay for old coffee!"}
{"text":"Nice deli, good food, in a hurry and need something for lunch or dinner then stop in at Martin's.    Nice assortment of sandwiches and hot foods.  Lots of food, beer and wine to choose from."}
