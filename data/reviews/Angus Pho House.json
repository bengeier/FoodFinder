{"text":"Super fast and delicious pho soup! I had the house special with the option that was only written in Vietnamese so I so to know what it was :)"}
{"text":"Best Pho in the area at a very reasonable price  
Their curry beef roti is also very good."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch. It can get crowded during peak hours like lunch time and dinner. The service is pretty fast overall and the food is usually fresh with good portions.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing pho! They are generous with the meat and the broth is flavourful and delicious. Service is fast. I came here for the laksa during dinner and they had ran out - luckily the pho I had instead was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Pho is served in larger portions but unfortunately don't make up for its lacklustre taste. Haven't tried the other menu items ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon where thy had lunch specials. They range from $8-10 and include pop. The \"regular\" sized pho was smaller than we expected but filling enough to get by. The vermicelli with a fish patty that we ordered was quite large, but was not included in the special menu. I had to ask for more fish sauce because I didn't find it flavourful enough. For those who are allergic, be aware that they do add peanuts to this dish, and it is not indicated on the menu, nor did the waiter ask about allergies! 

Service was typical, though they did forget to give us utensils until we asked. I'm sure this doesn't happen all the time! 

If you drive, parking is not the most convenient as it is on yonge, but there is a lot of paid street parking near by."}
{"text":"Only spot around Yonge and Finch where you can get decent pho. Vietnamese food has always been my favourite. I was pretty devastated when my usual go-to places for Vietnamese food either closed down, or the quality of their food diminished over time... It's been a real tough time trying to find a new spot... I got so desperate, I tried Pho Vietnamese Delight Down a block or two....it was more than terrible to say the least. But this place, is legit and I'm glad I discovered them. I recommend giving Angus Pho House a try. The one thing I wish they had on their menu would be banh cuon!"}
{"text":"Not your typical Vietnamese restaurant.  Most of the Vietnamese dishes had a Chinese taste to it.  

The spicy pork hock and mei wong was what we ordered.  Both soups had a different taste to what you would normally get at any Vietnamese restaurant.  The taste was not bad, it was actually pretty good in a way. 

Portion wise, pretty generous.  No complaints there.  Price wise, can't compare due to nature of location (just a tad more expensive but on par with other viet restaurants in area).

Will i come back... yes.  Need to try rice dishes.  Took another peek at other tables... again.  Lol  i really need to mind my own business in restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very much but I felt compelled to write.  Their food is very good quality but what stands out the most is their exceptional customer service.  They are always very friendly and accommodating.  In fact,  tonight I picked up my order and because I had to wait for only 1 minute for my order (I ordered only 5 minutes before) they sat me at a table and gave me tea while I waited. The place is also very clean and inviting.  This is one best Vietnamese places in the area."}
{"text":"I tried this place based on the good reviews on yelp but was utterly disappointed. The name is a compete misnomer, there's no real pho and they definitely don't use angus beef. It seems like they are famous for their Malaysian curry and \"thai\" style pho.

The owners or even chef is possibly chinese and I can't figure out what they are trying to be a Vietnamese restaurant or a Malaysian restaurant because they don't do either well.  Pho Spring Garden is another pho place that I don't mind despite not being authentic. I don't know if I would ever go back here though for the pho.  The meat was not the quality or variety you normally expect in a pho restaurant. 

The service was quick but be careful the floor is slippery and I can see an accident just waiting to happen with all them hot soups flying out the kitchen."}
{"text":"This has to be my one of favorite places to eat at in Toronto. When I have come here all the 4 times it was just amazing. I love their roti with goat curry. They also have very good soup and amazing summer rolls. But the only thing I am disappointed in is the spring rolls. It's not bad but I it's not very good. But I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Portions are good but lacking in taste. Also the waiter took back our plate of basil and lime and re-used it for another table after our 4 year old had already touched it. I didn't say anything as I didn't expect the waiter was going to recycle it and was too late after I saw what happened."}
{"text":"Maybe because we came so late at night on a weekday the food just didn't seem fresh or tasty. Place looks busy and has great reviews so could have got them on a bad day. The staff was great though!"}
{"text":"Since the only other pho restaurant is pho 88 by empress, the food here is decent. However, service is lacking. I suppose you don't go to these places for service, but because of the other options around, I will not go back just for the average food."}
{"text":"this place is great! they have a special for a large beef noodle + milk tea + curry fish balls only ~$7.99! i've been here once and was really impressed! i will be back."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place, so much so that I am willing to drive from downtown toronto (1 hour) just to eat their pad thai and steamed ginger chicken.

massive portions, great prices, small restaurant...but good service.

to the people that complain about the service...well, if you go in at a busy hour and the restaurant is packed, what do you expect??

will come back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing probably the best PHO, specially the broth I have tried and believe  me I'm a PHO addict!"}
{"text":"I read some good reviews about Angus Pho House and decided to try it out with a friend. Boy was it a disappointment.  They are really cheap on the food they served.  My grilled chicken, spring roll with vermicelli was really just a big bowl of thick noodles with fatty grilled chicken pieces, one small deep fried spring roll and a bunch of bean sprout and tiny amount of lettuce, carrot and cucumber.  It had no taste and the fish sauce that came with the dish tasted like sugar water. Did they forget the fish sauce?  I had better.  The avocado milkshake had a tiny hint of avocado, it tasted more like milk, the avocado colour did not fool me.   Is there a shortage of avocado?   My friend ordered the grilled chicken rice noodle soup and it was very salty.  This is how you cover up the fact that there are no other spices!  Add salt.  So glad we only ordered just a couple of dishes to try. (Suggestion: always try just a couple of dishes when trying out new restaurant, avoid ordering many dishes) This restaurant was more focused on how to save and profit more rather than serve a good hearty soup and other Vietnamese food.  C'mon Angus Pho House!  I am paying for the food, not like I am getting it for Free!  Service wasn't the greatest either.  A big disappointment therefore never ever going back."}
{"text":"If we're uptown and craving pho, my boyfriend and I always come here! It's our favourite uptown pho, always delicious (without making you thirsty after) and always comes out piping hot. We've tried a few things from the menu and we've never gotten something that tastes bad. The customer service is really great, the lady (owner?) is always so kind to us! 

If you order take out, you get a bowl for the noodles which is convenient, but eating in store is the best. Definitely recommend it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chicken Curry I have ever had. The Roti is thick in Texture perfect for the curry 5/5

Pad Thai is a 3/5

Pho is amazing, a must try. 

Good qualities for the pr"}
{"text":"3 stars for the Pho. It was ok. The rice dishes are better.

Extra star for the great service.and the fact they take credit card."}
{"text":"Tried the satay noodle beef, and the soup was good, not too oily, with generous portion of noodles and meats. Would definitely come back and recommend to friends.

The waiters were very friendly and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place got 4 stars on yelp, definitely overrated. 

I went there for lunch today and ordered the lemongrass beef ribs lunch special advertised on the restaurant's pop-up poster board. 

I thought it would be a safe choice given this is a featured dish on their advertising.

Boy, was I wrong!

When the dish came, there were only a few extremely thin slice of very small ribs lying on the big plate, most of them fatty. Vegetables are non existent other than two small slice of  cucumber. 
I guess the big mount of rice was supposed to be my main dish. 

So 11 dollars later, I walked out of there still hungry as hell and extremely unsatisfied. 

Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant but not the best pho spot either! Great location, not so busy on this part of Yonge (maybe caught a good day). Plenty of people in and out of this place so you know their doing something right. 

Pretty generous with their portions of noodle, soup and choice ingredients;

Angus Beef Rice Noodle soup (Small)
House Special Beef Rice Noodle soup (large)
Comes with Triple, flank brisket and Beef balls 

Under $20 (Don't forget to download app for 10% off - only did it for that day lol)"}
{"text":"I miss this place, came here two months ago when I visited Toronto. The best angus pho I ever had, even better than those in LA! Shrimp roll and curry dishes are very delicious as well.The place is clean, people are super friendly there.The location is great, you can grab a boba drink or dessert next to the restaurant. I will come bk to angus pho for sure if I have chance to visit Toronto again:)"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Curried beef and durian shake. One of the best meals I have in a while. Restaurant is modest looking but great food."}
{"text":"The noodle was plentiful and soup was tasty. We ordered the house special beef noodle soup and the tomato sauce beef brisket noodle soup. Both came out quick. This will be my new pho place. Just a note that the chef is from the same pho place that operated in the Richlane plaza"}
{"text":"Got the #46 beef brisket large for 11 bucks, the quality of the beef is always so good and the broth is always so tasty, as well I'm always left quite full. The fact that they're open very late most nights is perfect and their service is consistent. They shortened the menu to about half the original which makes the kitchen seem to move at a faster pace. I'm writing this review to make sure they stay open."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, great service. They only Pho restaurant I go to in North York."}
{"text":"This restaurant is owned by Asian chef but it is the best place in Toronto for some awesome cooked Malaysian curry and roti. Crispy roti with sweet and spicy curries are cooked to perfection. Check this place out you won't disappointed. 

Quality food at very attractive pricing (dishes range from $5 - $12) Great for students and families.

{"text":"Decided to try this after reading all the praise on yelp.  First time had Hainan chicken rice with spring roll and second time for their house special pho.  Raised by a Vietnamese mom, I am very particular when it comes to pho.  The place is definitely not authentic by any mean and they use dry vermicelli.  The broth to me lacks flavor but the portion is filling.  The price is also reasonable for now.  The bowl is too small so it's hard to maneuver after adding all the bean sprouts.  The meat, however, is of decent quality and much better than boring pho 88.  Hainan chicken rice is nice with sufficient amount of chicken and rice.  Spring roll is crispy outside while crunchy inside, decent but I've had better.  Curry chicken rice is a big disappointment because I don't get the usual kick I expect from Southasian style of curry.  It's very mild and bland.

Tried it for third time today and the experience was overwhelmingly bad.  First of all I ordered lunch special with curry rice+soup+lemon tea, so I figure they'd give me tea and soup first and main dish at the end like last time.  But no, I've been waiting and waiting and they gave me my curry rice, so I asked them where are my soup and the tea.  I was told no problem and the waiter went tell the kitchen, so after I finished my lunch I saw no sign of soup and tea.  So I went to washroom and was about to get the bill.  They sent out my tea.  Great timing guys.  I told the waiter I finish my lunch already and I never received the soup.  The waiter looked kinda confused when I asked the question and I told him on your menu the daily combo/special comes with soup and tea.  Then he apologized and said he'd check with the kitchen.  Then 1 minute later he brought out my soup, after I've finished eating.  I don't know if the restaurant has changed hand because not only I saw no sign of the helpful waiter I had last 2 times, all the wait staffs look new and clueless at the check out counter.  This is a small thing but it's all about principle.  When you did list on your combo/special shouldn't you make sure the customers receive what they order?  Even if they don't drink it.  I have very low expectations on customer service but this is very bad.  I'm pretty sure I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"Came here based on recommendations, however I didn't get the soup noodles or the curry. I got the dry vermicelli noodles with chicken and an avocado milk shake.  The springs rolls are not good, similar to other Pho places. The noodles were over cooked and were too thick, it's not the usual noodles from other Pho restaurants. The avocado shake was not creamy enough and was a little bland.  I will have to try the curry one day to see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"The portion was decent and the broth was flavourful but the star of the show was truly the beef. You can taste the difference of how fresh the beef is. Be sure to ask for fresh noodles since they will give you other kind if you don't ask specifically. The service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"The lady that runs the place is extremely friendly and nice.  The portions are very large and the flavours are all on point.  Very happy to find this place in North York!!  They deliver too!"}
{"text":"OK place for a bowl of pho in the Finch area. The lime wedge was fresh and sprouts were crunchy. There is nothing really special or noteworthy about this place. 

I might try their tom yum or rice dishes next time I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Really nice bowl of glass noodles and seafood, and a very nice shrimp wrapped around sugarcane. Service was also good."}
{"text":"100% worth the price. Quick and warm service and staff. Great quality and portion. Clean. Owner is a woman from Hong Kong, very homely."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at this restaurant and I ordered the \"Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - #56\" which was pretty good in flavour. 

The only down side was when the bowl arrive to our table, the soup was slightly hot. Not hot enough for my liking. 

Portion was generous with noodles, meat & veggies. 

Service was good, food was served quite quick & the price was fair. 

I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"First time coming with a rather large group. I got the Satay Beef noodle soup which comes with several toppings, including sausage, pork hock and beef slices. It was apparently not nearly as spicy as the last time my friend ordered it, which might indicate inconsistency in the kitchen. However, I was satisfied with the dish. The staff were very friendly and made sure that we were comfortable during our stay."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Angus Pho House for some laksa after review some photos. My experiences with the Markham location have been relatively positive and thought it would be a good idea to give the North York location a try. The menu has changed drastically and no longer offer that item. Please refer to the posted menu before making your visit! Many items have been adjusted and/or removed since their conception. 

The service of the establishment is very friendly and staff are patient with questions. However, in terms of menu setup, it is very confusing. The blends of colour make it inconvenient to decipher the specials and which items are currently available. For regulars, I'm sure this isn't an issue but for those fresh to the establishment and wishing to browse the menu could find themselves wracking their brains figuring it out. The waitress serving us was not sure herself of how the menu worked and what we could order. 

The food overall was underwhelming. The portions for the curry and roti we ordered was rather small and overall flavour was simply lacking. While the noodle portions of the pho on point, the meat and other proteins were very limited. There was nothing noteworthy about any of the dishes we ordered. 

It is evident that, despite the strong reviews, Angus Pho House has dropped in quality and will be a fragment of the past with the intense level of competition with better offerings in terms of flavour and portions in the area."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious noodle soup i ever had in toronto! I ordered it on just eat at least once a week?and they always delivered the food within 10min. 5 star for services, and 5 star for the food. Everything on their menu are delicious, but I love their tomato sauce beef brisket noodle soup best!"}
{"text":"If you're in North York and looking for delicious pho that comes with excellent service, Angus Pho is your best bet.

They can be quite busy if you eat at the restaurant otherwise you can always order online on Tasteaway for pickup or delivery ($2 extra). 

I am in love with their vermicelli dishes. It's perfect if you want a light meal - the vermicelli pairs well with the marinated meat depending on your order. 4/5 time I always order the vermicelli. 

Then on cold days, a bowl of their house pho can be super comforting. The broth is not too salty and the portions are generous for the price. The roti with curry sauce is also delicious although I wish they cut up the roti into smaller pieces. The curry can be a tad oily so try and finish it before it gets cold.. Because nobody likes dipping in cold oily sauce..

The staff is friendly and always quick to service everyone. I am a fan! Call me a regular!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! :) 

Previously I used to eat at the other Pho place down the street (the one with the Cow logo and a blue sign) but was dissatisfied their terrible service. At that restaurant (not Angus), they forced me to pay tip and always treated my friends and I terribly despite being regulars for years! Just ranting about that restaurant because they're horrible... and they close their kitchen at 10pm when their restaurant clearly says they close at 11pm.

ANYWAY! About Angus... I think the service is comparatively ... amazing! The servers are really kind and value great customer service. When there was a leak in the roof, they gave us a free treat to accommodate the damaged pipe systems.

The food is delicious and the portions are standard. I personally would ask for more servings to each dish, but I guess their fancy plating gives reason as to why they can't serve more. There isn't much oil in their Pho, which I appreciate. And the bowls don't have residue of previous pho.. which is quite sanitary. 

Good food, great service, average portions."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at around 6:30. We didn't have any trouble getting a table but the place started to get pretty busy once it went past 7pm.

My buddies had the pho while I had the pad thai from their combo menu for about $10.50 before tax and tip. I didn't get a chance to try the pho, but the pad thai was really good compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. For starters, the portion was huge and was enough for two satisfying meals (I couldn't finish it in one sitting and had the leftovers for lunch the next day and was full from that too). The pad thai came with chicken, shrimp and tofu, they were very generous with the protein servings. The pad thai itself was cooked really well, albeit it was a bit more oily than usual. The combo also came with a can of pop, so all in all it was a great deal."}
{"text":"I ordered the house special pho. The portion of pho was generous and the servers were pretty responsive. The food was great and I'd love to come back."}
{"text":"Best pho in the neighbourhood. Very tasty broth. Love the crispiness of the Viet spring rolls.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"The soup noodles taste pretty good. They also have a special promotion that if you download their application, Angus Pho House app, you can get a sweet with 10% off."}
{"text":"Pretty good flavours and generous portion sizes for the price. Taste is similar to another popular Viet place called 'Ginger' if you know it. Their pho and broth is respectable and I particularly like their lemongrass pork chop on rice. Pickled side dish is pretty good too. Service is fast and friendly and food time to table is typically within 5 minutes; very respectable. These guys get 4 stars (yum).

Taste: 4 (yum)
Wait time: 4 (yum)
Service: 4 (yum)
Ambience: 2 (sigh)
Value: 4 (yum)"}
{"text":"Angus Pho House is a hit or miss restaurant. The staff is great and what makes this place a worthwhile visit. Very attentive, helpful with recommendations and friendly. The food is where you may have a great experience or a subpar one. I had the pad Thai at the recommendation of our server. Although it says spicy and the server said it was spicy - it really was more \"not sweet\" like you might expect with most pad Thais. That said, it was pretty good. The flavours went well together and there was a good noodle:chicken:shrimp ratio. They didn't skimp on the shrimp like a lot of places do and the different flavour profiles of each ingredient added to an overall good combination. The fish cakes however were mediocre. There was not really any taste without adding some sauce to it and was a bit rubbery otherwise. I didn't have the pho myself, but one of my friends did. He wasn't very enthusiastic about his meal. The noodle to meat ratio wasn't ideal. The meat itself wasn't of a very good quality, being heavily tangled together with far too much fat that was difficult to remove compared to the actual meat portion. The broth wasn't very flavourful and the noodles were thin. Overall he didn't find the quality very good. That said, the portion size was quite large (same with the pad Thai). If you're looking for a filling meal and are more concerned over quantity to quality, this place is great. However, there are other places at a similar price point that provide a more consistent and quality experience."}
{"text":"I came because of the reviews but I guess the hype left me wanting. Here is why:

When you meld two genres in one restaurant, in this case Malaysian and Vietnamese you either kill or do two things ok. 

The rice with pork chop and bbq chicken were so so, the meat was heavily peppered, viet and Malay meat doesn't utilize pepper as a main spice. 

The pho was average, the broth probably coming from mix. I'm writing this review 1 hour after leaving and I'm craving lots of water. 

Telltale signs that I may be right were the cooks and server spoke mandarin.  

As with all the other reviews I agree the price was right for what you get. 

Service was fast and pleasant hence the 3 stars. 

So if you like authentic fast Malaysian and Viet food go elsewhere.  If you need a quick fast fix, not picky for authenticity  and the group cannot decide on a restaurant, then this is your place."}
{"text":"We found this place when Yelping around midnight on a Tuesday night, when we craved some midnight pho, and found out that this is the only pho place that's open past 11pm around the North York area, so we gave it a shot

We ordered take out and the house special pho, as well as their curry brisket beef dish over the phone,  the lady on the phone indicated they would be ready to pickup in 20 min.
 
When I arrived at the restaurant to pickup around midnight,  I was surprised to see there were quite a few  tables occupied oat midnight on a Tuesday night, I asked the owner and they indicated they open daily until 4am except Mondays!  that's pretty convenient for people living in the area craving pho past midnight~ I guess they are competing for the same clientele as nearby Owl and the rest of the 24 hr Korean restaurants in the area, nice to see there's a bit more variety in the late night dining scene in North York.

The House special pho in take out packages came in separate containers for the soup broth, noodles, as well as the bean sprouts etc, which is great as it maintain the freshness of all ingredients.   They actually provided a clear plastic bowl for the noodles so I guess you could potential just pour the broth into the plastic bowl container with the noodles and ingredients,  which would be very convenient ( we used our own bowls at home instead).

The soup broth is good but not the best we've tried. The curry is a little bit on the oily side but is tasty,  at midnight I wouldn't mind it, but I prob won't come here during regular dinner hours.  Nevertheless, I'm still glad that we have access to latenight pho uptown now, I would recommend this place as a late night snack option~"}
{"text":"Ordered their satay beef noodle soup and was not impressed. The beef & noodles were pretty standard and the broth only had a mild satay-like flavour, not the rich satay broth I'm used to at Pho Vietnamese Delight up the street. Service was prompt & efficient but serving customers room temp water is a turn off for me, especially if it's a hot humid day. Thankfully they had the AC on.  This is another example of a restaurant trying to offer too much on the menu & miserably failing...such a shame."}
{"text":"You don't go to a place like this for spectacular service or atmosphere, but what you should try here is the curry roti. Yup. The goat curry roti, to be exact. The roti itself is thin, doughy and flaky. The curry is medium-spiced, easily handled by anyone to be sure.

Pho is pretty much standard wherever you go, nothing super special, but a nice option for Yonge and Finchers who need a break from spicy korean soup."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and is open really late. Good for a mid night snack.  Not the cleanest Restaurant."}
{"text":"The place was alright. It was clean and the service was good. Their pho was OK. Not the best pho I ever had and not the worse either. I thought the broth tasted like the pho spices and MSG (like most pho places). I just thought the pho wasn't special or anything. I might come back and try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Your average pho restaurant. The meat quality is standard, a bit fatty but not knotty. I liked the broth and it was salted nicely but not overtly done. I ordered the lunch combo but didn't get the sides or meatballs in the house pho as advertised but I didn't notice until afterwards."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, 

The prices are reasonable and the small is quite large for a small (currently the small bowl is angled)

Have tv
Never been a loud environment
Pho is amazing
Lots of beef and Good distribution of noodles"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

Noticed this place popped up recently at FMP and decided to try it out as it was close and convenient.

Got a small pho and it came out super quick. The portion is quite big for a small size. Lots of toppings and noodles compared to other places. Soup base was light tasting and not too salty. The noodles however were a bit too soft for me. Also not a big fan of the bowl that they were serving in.

Their curry roti was apparently recommended by quite a few folks at the North York location so I gave it a try. It was alright, pretty basic stuff - tasted like puff pastry. I would prefer a less oily, thinner and chewier texture.

I will come back to try their other dishes such as the pork chop rice and the house special stir fried noodles."}
{"text":"Great tasting pho. Tried the Thai style which was interesting. Not too spicy. The meat is basically what sets this place apart though... generous amounts of meat, and it's pretty tasty/ better quality than most other pho places. 

Roti dish was also pretty decent, although I'll probably stick to the pho in future.

Bowl (large) is pretty huge, and about $8

Friendly service
Takes credit card/ near Yonge & Finch TTC"}
{"text":"My mouth became so dry shortly after finishing my meal here... it could have been the possible use of msg... certainly not going back!"}
{"text":"Have had two solid quality delivery meals, tried both the viet and malay dishes.

Dishes tried include:
- Roti and curry sauce - great large flaky roti, yummy coconut curry sauce 8/10

- Roti and Beef Brisket -  great roti, great sauce, great beef, I like brisket fatty, but I had numerous large fat chunks without beef, not my preference. But the other beef chunks were very tasty. 6.5/10

- Pad Thai - canadian style, but not too dry or saucy, tons of chicken and unusually large shrimp in the dish - quite good, if not traditional. 8/10

- Lemongrass Chicken Vermicelli - lots of tasty chicken, non-ideal thicker vermicelli (spaghettoni thickness), too much chopped lettuce filler underneath. 7/10

- BBQ Pork Vermicelli - medium-small portion of pork, unfortunate thicker vermicelli (too-soft & spaghettoni thickness), too much chopped lettuce filler hidden underneath. 6/10

- Spring Rolls - good quality, nice crispy shell, a bit small for almost $3 per roll 7/10

- Fried Lemongrass Wings - OK, but 2.5 wings or 5 small pieces @ $2.60 per wing???? 2/10 

So far it's all been quite good, BUT I cannot seem to get them to send the red sambal oelek chili paste, no matter how hard I try!  Next time I'll threaten not to pay driver unless its included ;)"}
{"text":"This is my fav spot to get pho! They have really awesome lunch specials, and it includes dishes that aren't pho. It's pretty small, but I've never had an issue getting a table. I always get the Beef satay pho. I love it because it's nice and spicy, but not overpowering. It also has peanuts in there, and pineapple! I did not think i would like that, but the spicy and sweet flavors compliment each other so well. Definitely a great spot for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I normally go to Kim po (steels and Kennedy location) but this time was on my way to jack Astros on Yonge and didn't feel like going out of my way, and I don't exactly like 88, and pho train. since this places ratings were not that bad I tried it out.
I went out of my normal pho tai and got a satay broth, this is only cuz he(server) told me it wasn't like the normal over the top peanut satay. And he didn't lie, it did have peanuts in it, but was much better then the normal satay yet still spicy. 
My friend got the Thai broth, he didn't find it sour, but on boy I did. Near the end of his meal he agreed and said his broth was a bit sour. The noodles were good, not too starchy and just the right about for the size. Bean sprouts were not the freshest in any way or sense, had to pass on them.
My other friend got the regular broth, but with all the spice and peanut I couldn't taste any thing. But it wasn't too salty or over done with MSG from what I could tell and from what he told me 

Place is small ish
Does take debit and card
I would come back if I was in the area, 

Oh almost forgot: they forgot to make one of the three bowls of pho, they tried to tell me it would be right out and I told them I knew they had forgotten it and they laughed and said yeah, they brought over a can of ice tea. To hold off my friend, it wasn't till about half way into my meal that his food came, when it did come it was the wrong size. They gave us 10% off the bill in the end, there was 3 of them working the floor and perhaps another two working the back, and about the same number of guest in the restaurant. It was annoying that we had to wait for my friend to finish but I guess they tried to fix a problem after they tried to cover it up."}
{"text":"We decided to try this Pho place yesterday for lunch. If Yelp allowed half of stars, this place will be rated 3.5*. From the outside, this place doesn't look like much but inside is clean.

The portions were large."}

{"text":"Cute wall decorations, cozy and small. I definitely don't recommend large groups but they definitely do have flavour. the Phô's broth is a tad oily but has a unique flavour. meat is not dry with great flavour. portion is perfect (for me) with a small size that is a tad smaller than other Phô locations."}

{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is not great. Not horrible, but not great either. Kind of subpar to be honest.

What's worse than the food is the attitude and service of this location. 
Let me explain:

I had just received a pho I had ordered (rare beef with tripe). Right as I begin eating I find a fly in the soup. Absolutely filthy, but I understand that it might happen from time to time. I called the lady over and showed her the fly and that they should just take it back. She asked me if I wanted anything else but as I had lost my appetite I declined and watched as my friends finished their food. 

Then came the bill.
She included the price of the pho, which I had not touched, which had a fly chilling in the soup as if it were on a lazy river, on the bill. I obviously thought she had just forgot to void it so I brought it up to her. She then had the audacity to tell me that she could not take it off the bill and that I would have to PAY HER for SERVING ME a FLY soup. When I refused she thought about it and told me she'd give me 10% off instead. I was dumbfounded and unfortunately in a hurry and not willing to fight for $10 so I told her that what she's doing is wrong, paid the devil her share and left.

Will NEVER be going back.
I recommend coming here if you enjoy paying for small insects with your soup."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Pho joints in town. Had the satay beef and it was unbelievable! The shrimp wrap was nothing to write home about but everything was pretty inexpensive and good so i give them a 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"So tasty. Came here for a work lunch and we were all extremely impressed with the freshness, quality and the friendly fast service. Would travel back here from downtown it's that good!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected based on the reviews. 
Upon entering this place it kind of reminded me of the Hong Kong Street noodle shops dingy and not very clean. 

The menu is good with lots of selection, at first sight I would say their noodles look appetizing and picture perfect. 

Upon receiving the food though I found the broth to be tasteless and very oily ( did not skim the fat off the top well enough). The fresh rolls were far from fresh unfortunately and some of the meats had a sour and moldy taste and smell to it. Really wish this place tasted better but it tasted more like Chinese noodle soup rather than the fresh taste of Vietnamese Pho. 

They also sell the Hong Kong Style milk tea which is the only notably good item I had when I was there. 

If your looking for pho-king fabulous noodles this isn't the place. Please try Vietnam Noodle Bar or Anh Dao they have the best and most flavourful broths."}
{"text":"Good meat in the pho, boring soup. Would be amazing if soup was more authentic instead of light oil taste but not bad. Standard chinese owned pho but good meat. Fast service."}
{"text":"Generous portions and very good quality of food/ingredients. 

The service is fast and especially courteous and attentive. 

Would love to return to check out for more."}
{"text":"Service is good.  Ambient is not that great.  Food tastes OK, good portion.  Will return if I am hungry and need a big meal at low price."}
{"text":"Yummy pho within the North York area! Woohoo. 

I would say that I enjoy Angus Pho House's broth a lot as it contains lots of onions and scallions. I want to say that this place is quite consistent but unfortunately the last time I went, my friend got a very small portion in terms of meat and noodles, even though we both ordered the same size. Overall, I am quite satisfied with this place.

The interior is pretty standard, but you have to go downstairs to get to the washroom. This wouldn't stop me from going here whenever I feel like having pho!"}
{"text":"Came for pho. Was informed that they had no bean sprouts. Offered nothing as an alternative, which is quite disappointing. No bok choy...or some other crunchy vegetables that I could add to my bowl. There's an h-mart next door; run over and grab a bag of emergency supply if you've run out for the day or something.

Nothing particularly stood out. Noodles were pretty bland, wasn't that much meat. Soup was pretty average.

Perhaps pho isn't their specialty despite the store name."}
{"text":"Went here for the fist time yesterday.

From the friendly staff to the fresh generous portions, this place was great.  Looked like they knew their locals which creates a warm atmosphere.

I had a large house pho with a spring roll appetizer.   Broth was delicious and they give you tons of noodles.

Would definitely go back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Found this spot on Yelp when I was looking for somewhere with more than pho in the Yonge/Finch area. When you have a craving for pho, it needs to be fulfilled! But I also wanted something more hearty as well, then I spied curry on the menu. Curry + pho, must go.

So, a group of 4 of us went here on a Friday around ..almost 11pm. The place was packed. We got seated at the only table that was left (woohoo!)

We ordered- 
Curry with roti (#110)
Shrimp/chicken/egg house fried noodles (#090)
Greens ( gai-lan ) with oyster sauce (#151)
Goat brisket curry and roti (#107)
A plain pho (#052) & house special pho (#042) - the large is HUGE, FYI.

Although the food took a little while to come out as the restaurant was busy, our table was near the kitchen window. We were distracted and intrigued by the speed of cooking/watching food coming out, which helped to simmer the *why is this taking so long* comments from our hungry, hungry selves.

As soon as food started coming to the table and everyone had first-tastes, there were no complaints (this is rare with our group)-- and then everything was instantly being demolished. 

Both curries were a huge hit, mild but flavorful. The roti was incredible, in fact, I am almost drooling just thinking about it. The sizes for the pho bowls were larger than other restaurants, definitely no complaints there either!

The waitress was super friendly towards us and seemed very capable of handling a full restaurant of people and being the only server - kudos.

I do have to admit that we were slightly annoyed because they set forks down in front of us assuming we did not know how to use chopsticks. We looked around and noticed no-one else had forks, so... yeah there was that.

Anyhow, overall good experience and good food so we will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"The soup tasted really good but service was rude. I was sharing a small bowl with my boyfriend, and I asked for a spoon and chopsticks They didn't understand, so I repeated myself. When they are back they slapped down three  cheap wooden sushi-takeout chopsticks, and no spoon. It was so rude. The place was full and cramped but we stayed. It wasn't until my other friend asked for the spoon that I ate, because the waiter was maybe more inclined to give service to a paying caucasian person."}
{"text":"Definitely come here for their roti and curry! Love how flaky and flavorful this dish was! Pho was great as well but nothing like WOW it stands out. Staff was friendly and assertive."}
{"text":"The food was alright and the price. We had to ask for cleaner utensils and bowls but that's how most Asian restaurants are. Had to ask 3 times for water. Went at 4pm. 

The reason I'm giving 3 stars (probably generous after hearing my situation) is for the service. When I went up to the cashier to pay for my meal, I took the entire $11 for my $9 meal. This was because as a commuter, I needed money for the ttc and was still rummaging through my wallet to see if I have any coins for later. I had a friend that was willing to spot me 2 loonies but I wanted to check anyways. In addition, I get tips from my workplace so I have s lot of quarters I wanted to get rid of. 
As soon as I walk over to a table to place my wallet on top of, the waitresses start talking about how i didn't tip and how I'm a bad person in Cantonese. Fortunately, I did understand what they were saying. I would've preferred if they talked about the situation later, after I left. Also, if they waited until I left, they would've known that I've tipped but was ensuring I had the change I needed. 
It's like when waitresses immediately take the tips you leave for them while you're still at the table. In my case, I felt very uncomfortable and as a matter of fact, I was exhausted from a long day and probably doing things I don't usually do. However, I did ended up tipping them after looking through my wallet and making sure I had the money I needed. 
The worst part was when one of the waitresses said 'it happens what can you do' aloud in English. 
This was a very upsetting experience and I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This place is the best Pho Place in the area. If you are too lazy to drive to Pho Dau Bo then come here for your hangover cure.  The prices are a little bit on the high side but that is simply a reflection of the neighbourbood the reataurant is located in.  They have daily lunch specials that range from $7.95.  

I had the Fresh Rolls ($5) and a small house special Pho noodle soup. Both dishes were really good and fresh. The fresh rolls had shrimp, noodles, and lettuce that made it feel healthy and hearty.

The Pho tasted great and the broth tasted fresh and less fatty. My Small Pho dish had an equal amount of meat to noodle ratio and it all tasted oh so good!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this pho place near where I live that recently opened. It's in the corner of the plaza which could be hard to seen.

House special pho was quite average. The small size was good portion size for me. The broth had good flavour but not as strong as I like to be. The waitress asked if I wanted my beansprouts to be cooked which I said yes to. I do prefer my beansprouts to be cooked beforehand than on a side plate. 

Fast service, this place is good if you're looking for a fast, warm meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday and it was busier than I had anticipated. The staff are quite attentive and nice to customers.

I had ordered the spicy beef brisket noodles ($7.95 for a lunch special that came with a drink) and I regret what I had ordered. It's not a typical beef brisket noodle soup, but instead, they had pho rice noodles and a spicy broth with thinly sliced beef brisket. The broth was spicy and the noodles at just the right texture. However, I didn't think the flavours mixed at all! I really regret ordering this dish! 

I saw many others ordering lunch specials, which included grilled pork with rice, hainanese chicken with rice, curry brisket chicken, etc. These lunch specials are all $7.95+tax and come with a soft drink.

The decor is very simple and nothing special. It looks clean and the staff bring you water and cups as soon as you sit down. 

Overall, the value is there, but I really wish I tried a different dish! Maybe for another lunch adventure, I'll try a different dish."}
{"text":"I frequent this place and love it. This is a unique place in that in addition to pho, it offers a wide variety of Malaysian curry dishes. I've tried their Roti and curry sauce as well as goat curry...absolutely delicious ...prices are reasonable and service very friendly"}
{"text":"Great value, delicious pho. Portions are huge. Service was fast, friendly, and prompt. Can't think of anything negative about this place."}
{"text":"A good Pho place is hard to find. Angus Pho House is legit. The beef is tender and soup base has a great depth of beefy flavour and classic. Their spring roll is light, crispy and just yummy. Prices are reasonable, especially their sides. 
Next time I'll try their Roti and curries."}
{"text":"Pretty good, standard Pho. What makes them stand out are their lunch specials. I thought Viet food is already cheap but this place manages to pull off lunch specials. The lunch special comes with a snack like curry fish balls and a drink. I guess the owner is Chinese. 

I haven't tried their Malaysian food yet. It's definitely worth a shot, especially with their prices. 

If you want an \"authentic\" viet restaurant run with Vietnamese, this is not the place. This is a nice place that makes some standard viet food and also serves some irregular items."}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here  for Pho!  Customer service is very friendly and accommodating. Food portions are just enough that it doesn't overwhelm you but yet doesn't leave you starving. Located at First Markham place in the corner it's kind of hard to notice but definitely when you go and check them out it was well worth it. The only downside is that they don't have any change tables for babies. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place last year and I keep coming back. I love their spicy beef Pho and there nothing better on a cold day. 

I've seen the other menu items and they look great - just haven't tried them yet. The portions are quite big, and very filling with the noodles. I always struggle with a small bowls. 

And the people working there are absolutely wonderful. Always super nice and they check with you on any dietary restrictions or allergies."}
{"text":"Barely call this authentic viet. Edible but wished I didn't make this choice. The rice was dried and uncooked and the avocado shake made me cringe with the sheer memory resurfacing to write this review. Was no means a good choice of eats nor was it worth the price. Being at the foodie central area, I question how Angus is able to even compete with nearby restaurants. Worth skipping..."}
{"text":"Best pho resto in the area! This is the second time here and it did not disappoint. The broth is nice and light and portions are decent for a small size bowl of pho. A little pricey but you get what you pay for! Also, service was pretty decent for an asian joint. Definitely coming back for my next pho fix!"}
{"text":"Today was a lazy Sunday for me.. so I decided to order delivery. I've ordered the Thai fried fish cake, I find it lacking in flavour. 

I was craving for curry fish balls, the curry was not bad but the curry was a bit thick. 

The fried tofu was very tasty. Just enough flavour and it was crunchy. I really enjoyed this.

I've also ordered the Tom yum noodles, it was okay as the soup lacked the spice. 

I will definitely come back for the tofu and the iced tea!"}
{"text":"Came here because I was craving pho. We shared a large bowl of Angus pho along with their App platter (pictures below).

Angus pho was so delicious and they know it. No wonder the store is named \"Angus pho\". Waitress was super friendly and informative. Great service. Cozy location. Prices are reasonable.

Kudos for not using pho puns."}
{"text":"I'm a pho lover so I'm a little picky with the broth and noodle texture. This restaurant was pretty good. My fiancé and I went for dinner today- i had a pho noodle and my fiancé had a chicken and rice dish. Both were very good. The chicken portion was quite big (unlike some restaurants). We also ordered fried spring rolls. The price is similar to other pho restaurants but this restaurant was delicious. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great joint for quick, satisfying Viet/Malaysian/Thai comfort food. I was here yesterday and the new server (the girl with the short hair) was extremely friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Got the rare beef noodle soup
Pretty good
Place was also pretty busy
I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here. The food is extremely reasonably priced and the portions are so big. Most times I always take it to go because I can't finish it. The service is amazing, they're so friendly and accommodating. There are so many menu options and many kinds of pho of course. The dishes come with many sides and toppings including Thai basil, which tastes minty, bean sprouts, Sriracha, teriyaki sauce, and chili sauce. I definitely recommend mixing a small portion of the topping (like a drop of teriyaki or Sriracha) in your spoon with the soup so that you know if you want it or not. The first time I came I added a lot of teriyaki and Thai basil and ruined the flavour unfortunately so be cautious. If you don't finish they will gladly give it to you to go. We usually don't even spend more than $10 on a large pho and we always leave satisfied! Very happy with this place and I definitely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Not being Vietnamese myself, I cannot comment on the authenticity of their pho but both food and service are good here indeed. The place has a very nice atmosphere that pho 88 next block lacks. I only wish they had more space in this restaurant. Since, it is quite popular and usually packed during dinner time."}
{"text":"We were craving some pho today because it was super cold and rainy out and Yelp led us here. 

I had high hopes after reading all the reviews here, but I think my expectations were a bit too high. 

We came right at 3pm and were able to order off the lunch menu. Select $7.95 items that come with a can of pop. On their menu online, it says the lunch menu also comes with soup or something else, but we just got an entree and a pop. We got the house pho and the pad thai. 

The food came almost instantly. The pho was accompanied by the standard bean sprouts and basil. The broth of the pho wasn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for something more authentic in flavour, but the broth tasted a bit too salty (MSG?). Not a lot of meat in the pho. One piece of tripe, tendon, beef ball cut in 2 pieces, and some beef. 

The pad thai was very saucy and the shrimp were a good size. I was actually impressed. However, the sauce tasted a bit too much like ketchup. Not a huge fan of it. It also had scrambled eggs and grilled chicken. 

All in all, this place is just okay. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Saturday.. Speedy service.

However if the price of 6 pork skewers is the same price of 6 chicken skewers.. Why can't I split the order to go half and half?

My friend ordered the vermecili bowl with bbq pork which was more of a modified bbq pork not your traditional red stuff. It tasted fine but the noodles were kn the thick side. I personally prefer the thinner kind.

Pretty basic interior and washroom is just ok, not particularly clean or dirty."}
{"text":"For starters I should preface this by saying we didn't have the pho so I can't speak to that, however, what we did get was really unpleasant. The pad Thai tasted like it had a ketchup sauce on soggy noodles with chicken that was boney and gristely. The goat roti was alright but gave us a very bad stomachache. And the vermicelli are nothing like the noodles I'm used to and are beyond bland. Really disappointed and not sure how this place has 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time coming here and was not disappointed. The service is super fast. We both had Pho but we definitely will come back to try their other stuff as it looked amazing."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho in an area with an abundance of Asian food options. The noodles were a little too soft for my liking. However the broth for the beef satay soup was quite nice. It's got sweet, sour, and spicy notes that taste pretty good. You'll find pineapple chunks in the soup, which I really enjoyed but if you don't believe in having fruit in your savoury dishes then maybe you should skip the pineapples. It's good value for the amount of food you get, but I won't be rushing back here any time soon to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Service has always been great here, the servers take initiative by refilling water and such. I normally get the BBQ pork vermicelli and it has hit the spot every time I got it. Their pho is also good, all my friends like it."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try Angus Pho House this past Saturday and I was quite curious to see if it truly warranted all the great reviews it has received on Yelp.

I have been to quite a few Vietnamese restaurants all around the city and I would say that Angus Pho House is definitely not one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the city but at the same time the pho is pretty decent and it's probably the best one in Yonge and Finch area.

Food: I had a small pho house special ($6.50) and an avocado milkshake ($3.95). The broth was good, the noodles were cooked properly and the meat was of a decent quality. Nothing spectacular but definitely a decent option for the Yonge and Finch area. The portions were of a decent size and it was reasonably priced. The avocado milkshake was pretty good, creamy and not overly sweet.

Service: The service was good and the wait staff were quite friendly, the waiters were always refilling your teacup and because it's a small place, it wasn't too difficult to flag anyone down.

Cleanliness: The place is pretty new and from what I saw, it was pretty clean overall including the washrooms."}
{"text":"I can see why people prefer this pho place compared to the one down the street. I can feel that they take more time making the soup. It's just more authentic compared to most pho in the area. Also, I love how the owner is always so nice and gives a great service."}
{"text":"Love this place - just one of those reliable spots for some good comfort food. They deliver, they're open late, they're really reasonably priced and the food is consistently good.. my go to spot for a delicious, quiet bowl of soup, especially during the cold winter months..."}
{"text":"Good pho at a great price point. $6.50 for the \"small\" (practically the same size as large) bowl I consider to be the best value for dollar among uptown Viet places I have been to. Not much to say about the pho itself. For those who normally have pho, I think it is pretty standard...I did find the meat to have a bit more gristle and fat than other places. I am a bit weird and like a bit of gristle. Lol but I know that turns some people off.

The service is very quick, but really pesky. My friend and I were probably asked how we were doing probably a dozen times and they interupted our conversation almost every time! :( Maybe it was the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy when we got there (6:30 on a weekday) and the staff wanted to seem busy. However, unless my glass is empty, I feel that I don't need to be checked on more than once. Although, to their merit, our tea cups were always filled immediately which was very appreciated."}
{"text":"Very very very mediocre food.
Paid $62 for absolute junk. I would not feed the food to my dog let alone eating it myself.
I would have had a team of pathologist unable to distinguish which part of the chicken was in the pad Thai.
I essentially paid $62 for a truckload of noodle, a gallon of water and unwanted pieces of assorted meat!
Never again. I hope my review deters anyone from going here."}
{"text":"Decided to try the shrimp curry based on reviews. It was alright, I've had better. Also had the tom yum gong, this was pretty good! Not as good as the ones in Thailand but great compared to the majority I've tried in Toronto."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures, I was so excited to come here, only to be majorly let down.

The place is small but did not have to wait for a table or anything, it was mostly empty. They gave us a cup of tea but never ever came back to refill it. 

The curry has no flavour at all, I usually love roti and curry, but I'm not a fan of the roti here. 

The satay beef noodle soup in large was full of soup, little noodles, 5 pieces of beef and 2 pieces of pineapple. There was no satay taste at all, kind of spicy. Lacked any kind of flavour.

For what you get, I think the price is more pricey then other Vietnamese/Malaysian restaurants."}
{"text":"I've tried a handful of items from Angus Pho and I think they truly deserve this 5 star rating. Their pho uses fresh beef and does not cheap out on the other toppings such as beef balls, tripe or tendon if you choose to include it in your bowl. Soup is always piping hot and comes with a good amount of noodles to go with it.

Their lemongrass pork/chicken chop is delicious. Although sometimes I find that the pork chop might come with more fatty parts or tendons depending on the chef's mood on that day. Still, they give you a generous amount of pork or chicken.

I've tried their curry braised chicken too. It's not necessarily super spicy like Indian curry since this is considered Malaysian (I think). You can really taste the sweet coconut juices in their curry sauce.

Service is fast and attentive for both dine in and take out. They speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin. You may have to wait for a table if you go during peak lunch/dinner hours and have to wait near the door or outside the restaurant in -20 degree weather. Bathrooms are located in the basement of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food wasn't that good.  In general,  I hate it.  As a Vietnamese,  the pho soup didnt taste like Vietnamese soup at all.  It tastes like some Chinese beef soup. I did know it the moment they all spoke Chinese.  I did not mind that since they are Chinese( even the cook).  However,  the beef that they served was horrible.  It doesn't taste like beef at all.  No flavour.  The beef looked like the cheap hot pot frozen meat that you have in ayce hot pot place.  It wasn't fresh.  The moment you used your chopstick to touch it,  it started falling apart.  Don't really know how they can call themselves  beef Angus house restaurant.  Came here once and never come back"}
{"text":"Same Chef from rich tree lemon grass. Their portions are good. Good bang for your buck. I usually get the curry dishes, pho or satay beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"Not up to par compared to other pho places.  Serves the purpose if you are looking for a bowl of pho in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Almost empty on a Sunday evening,  we were so excited to have pho again. We got a large pho (#23) with shredded chicken instead of grilled. Food came out pretty quickly.  Though the chicken is tender,  and im glad its chicken breast and not soggy chicken scraps,  the noodles were thinner and chewier than I remember;  they weren't silky and delicate. The soup was also heavily garnished with fried onions and a little salty."}
{"text":"The combo pic is easy to choose. I just take less then 1 min, which is quite good for me. I will come a lot."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place in my area now. I've tried the vermicelli and the pork chop rice. Both good potions and the meats (I've tried chicken and pork chop) are tender and pretty juicy. 

My husband usually get the pho and I've tried a bite and seems pretty good. 

Prices are reasonable like any other pho place. This place delivers if your in the North York yonge and shep area!! There's not much seating so I would do delivery if you can."}
{"text":"The roti and curry dish is one of my favorites here. It reminds me of the roti in Singapore's Indian neighborhood.
The pho is delicious with a broth that is just right. I don't like it too salty. Service is friendly and fast. The prices are very fair. I don't come here too often, but it's a quality pho house to satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"In search of good pho, but ordered Pad Thai. 

I can already safely say that I will be back.  

The chicken and shrimp pad Thai arrived to my table and it looked amazing.  Very decent sized portions as well.  Delicious and flavorful.  No complaints whatsoever.  

My boyfriend ordered a soup with beef and beef balls from what I recall.  It was also very yummy.  

We had decided to switch and split both dishes.  Got the best of both worlds.  

Hot crushed chili peppers were already readily available and there was nothing left by the end of the meal.  

Overall the place is neat and clean with just enough space not to be crowded with tables.  Staff were attentive with refilling my tea when needed.   

I can understand why this business deserves all the good reviews.  Glad I took the time to discover this gem."}
{"text":"Food is simple here. If you want a quick eat without any frills, come here. My boyfriend and I got the $9 combo. So it's the lemongrass pork chop and Pho with Soya milk for each. The taste is acceptable. The pork chop is tender and the rice serving is really good. They also provide this sweet vinegar sauce which I really like and appreciate. You might want to try pouring that sauce ok your rice. Messy but it's good. The Pho was tasty and the broth is good. The serving portion may not be as big because it's a combo. But I remember my boyfriend saying he was really full. Anyway! This place is always my go to place for simple and fast Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Read the review and tried once and kept going back especially in cold winter evenings! Our fav: vermicelli, curry beef briskets and tendons, Roti, Sarah/ house special ho fan."}
{"text":"Really delicious pho with really great service!

This pho house is amazing. The restaurant is not too big but it's comfortable. The owners are cantonese and super friendly, even when you have a lot of requests to change about your pho. I always get the house special (small). A small is the biggest small I've ever seen in my life. This small can well qualify for an extra large anywhere else. The portions are big, not just the bowl. The noodles are fresh and delicious while the broth is warm, inviting and lack the salty taste of MSG. Pro tip: get your rare beef raw, on the side on a plate. It's like having your own hotpot in the broth and never having overcooked beef. Delicious! 

I will be back!! Prices are good, especially when the bowl of pho is gigantic! I've never once yet finished a full bowl of small here."}
{"text":"First time trying out pho in north york. It was actually good. I ordered the small House special pho, with rare beef, beef balls, beef brisket, beef tendon and beef intestine. Small was enough to fill me up :) I like their thin rice noodle, and their broth was flavorful,  which made the rice noodle tasty. The pho is served with beansprouts and mint on the side, and there's Sriracha sauce on each table for those who like to spice it up. Water was served without asking. Overall, good food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for halal Pho in the GTA so, we searched on Yelp and Angus Pho was listed as number 1. We called the listed number and they said their meat isn't halal. Why is this listed under halal then?"}
{"text":"I've been to Pho House many times over the years. The food is always really great, the service is always amazing. I have had the chicken pad thai and the meal that is grilled chicken, pork, with rice. The food is always portioned great, so you never leave hungry. The waitresses have always been the same when I've gone, so I believe it is a family business, I could be wrong. None the less, they are always very friendly and the food is always ready in a timely manner. 
The restaurant is a bit small, 4 booths and about 5 couple seats and maybe 6 tables that fit 4 people. It can get a bit noisy, especially when someone orders a drink that needs to be in a blender. They make those drinks out in the dining area rather than the kitchen so for a few seconds you will hear the loud blender. 
I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for seat, however the restaurant does get fairly busy on Friday nights and weekends.
I'm not sure if they do reservations but I would recommend making one if you plan to go on the busy weekends for dinner.
Other than that, it is a great place to eat, and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"It was refreshing to try a new pho place! This did not disappoint! My friend and I came in when there was no one in the restaurant. But once we were in the middle of eating, the restaurant was already packed!  I ordered the house special pho with everything and my friend ordered a spicy type of pho/noodles. The portions were quite large and was hard to finish! I got the large and it is cheaper than some places you get pho in Scarborough. Also the meat was cooked just right and the broth wasn't oily or full of a lot of salt like other places.  So it was soo worth it! The service was quick and the servers were friendly and helpful! I would definitely come back again! (:"}
{"text":"It was ok. Not the worst place in the world and not the best. I don't think I would crave the food here or come back anytime soon. My fiancé ordered the curry and rice and one chicken was pink, which he didn't enjoy. I ordered the satay beef soup. Which wasn't too spicy in my opinion. I thought it was good but it wasn't life changing or anything. The only reason we decided to check it out was because they're open late."}
{"text":"The spirit of lemongrass (from 16th and Leslie) lives on here!  Love the beef brisket curry, love the pho, love the  bbq lemongrass chicken, and the roti!  Oh man. That roti!  Yum"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to try the place. I was enticed by their restaurant name having \"angus\" in it so I thought their pho beef was perhaps better quality. Order their large house special, BBQ chicken vermicelli and avocado milkshake. Their pho wasn't bad. The beef was good. I guess they were a little more generous with the toppings but the broth was not that flavourful compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. It was just an okay bowl of pho. I requested the vermicelli to be a thinner version and they instead gave me hot pho noodles. When I asked why they did this, their server told me it was because they had run out. I advised them to let customers know of this before hand. I've never been to a Vietnamese restaurant that serves their vermicelli hot. I then asked them to give me the regular vermicelli noodles since I was not going to eat it hot. The server was nice and apologized. The vermicelli came and some noodles were hard...but I didn't care anymore. The avocado milkshake was different. I'm not sure if they usually put condensed milk in an avocado milk shake but I was able to taste it. Plus the milk shake was 6.50 (2-3 bucks more than average Vietnamese restaurant)"}
{"text":"Delicious house special pho! Clean place, quick and friendly service... And the hours when they are open make it available for an awesome late night \"snack\" - good portion sizes, so more of a large meal, available when you are ))"}
{"text":"I came here two days in a row after work. They have one of the best pho soups I've had in a long time. I'll definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only restaurant open at 2 am.  Order the pho noodles.  

Soup was clean (not heavy) and the rare angus beef tasted awesome."}
{"text":"Place is a very simple set up, nothing fancy, the guys running the place are super nice and pleasant and they joke with you. Pho was super nice andthe broth was not greasy at all, we also had cold rolls and they were delicious, I will definatelly take the trip from downtown to this place again!"}
{"text":"The owner is so rude because she usually talks behind customers's back in Cantonese.
The food is normal, nothing special."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a good grasp of Vietnamese pho soup broth and base, such that the taste is authentic and delicious. Their vermicelli noodles are thicker here than anywhere else I've gone, but was delicious nonetheless. Great service and cheap prices made for a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. The pho was very tasty but also very salty. Customer service was very good and they are located close to Finch subway station. Would come back again."}
{"text":"after seeing all the rave reviews on this place i have now gone to angus pho house a few times to try out the different items.  the pho have a good broth and good amount of beef.  probably the best pho in the yonge and finch area but there really isn't much competition in the area.  i have also tried the curry chicken with roti and i was disappointed in the dish.  the roti was super dry and it was mangled in the takeout container.  the curry was descent but found the chicken pieces had more bones than meat.  they also have lunch specials but its only thru dine in which i thought was kinda strange.  so if you live in this area you should give the pho a try but i just can't understand why this place is getting such great reviews."}
{"text":"I came here based on reviews.. My first impression was not good. It was a Sunday during lunch hours, and it was EMPTY when me and a friend stepped in. No customers visited during our entire time there..

I asked the server if they served bun bo hue, and I said it in Vietnamese. She had no idea what I was asking for because she is not vietnamese. I was surprised because this is a beef noodle house and bun bo hue is a popular beef noodle item. Anyways, I ordered the satay beef noodles instead since that was the closest thing to what I originally wanted. My friend ordered pork chop with rice.

The food was mediocre.

In terms of service, it was very unprofessional. Because there were no other customers except my table, the servers were just hanging at the tables and talking very loud. The restaurant is small, so it got quite distracting.

I will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but nothing special. The pho special was tasty but their beef satay pho was a little disappointing. We also tried their Curry fish balls. Tasted just like ones you buy from the grocery store. This place is good if it's nearby and you're hungry and just want to eat. They are generous with their portions so it will fill you up."}
{"text":"The only edible pho nearby Yonge & Finch. I strongly recommend their roti & curry."}
{"text":"Awesome Hainan Chicken with Rice!! Both dishes of my friend and I ordered are soooo delicious!!! The chicken tasted so tender and flavourful with its house-made chilli sauce. The soup of pho was super appetizing~ The staff was friendly and price was really reasonable. It was one of the best restaurants beside some korean cuisine in North York."}
{"text":"There's something about pho that's addictive! Maybe it's our brutal cold winters or maybe because pho runs in my blood. I am not sure but there are times when I find myself driving aimlessly to another part of town in the middle of the night on a quest to get my pho fix; this stuff is like crack and I love being the addict.

I am inclined to give this place all 5 stars had it not been that one mediocre experience last time I visited. I have been to this place close to half a dozen times and they have always been consistently delicious with attentive service. Now, I've come to expect mediocre service in any pho restaurant (it's a fact) but being neglected is a whole new level. Also, I am not sure what happened to the portions on my last visit; I felt like I had the kids meal?

Anyhow, on to the good. The broth is clear and yummy. The noodles are slightly overdone but still pretty good. They also use decent quality meats; you won't find ice-cap size of lard bits floating in your soup like some other places. I was very surprised to discover that their curry and roti is quite delicious.

I will definitely be back as I've had a good run of great meals at this place but I do have my reservations. If you are in the area, it's next to impossible to find another pho place that can compete with this."}
{"text":"Not sure how long this place has been here but we finally got to try it out! I'm a huge Viet food fan and literally am always up for Viet. So I was very interested in trying this place out with my family. 

As far as service goes, it was friendly and quick! And we were super hungry so that was perfect! It didn't seem very busy but it was a Monday night so maybe it's just a quieter night in general. 

We ordered the apps platter which came with the sugar cane shrimp, skewers, spring rolls and fish cake. This platter was big and tasted alright. I was disappointed with the beef skewer which was very dry and had a really bad texture to it. I ordered the BBQ chicken bun and that was pretty refreshing! They use really thick vermicelli compared to other restaurants but I didn't really think that deterred me from wanting more. We also got the grilled chicken rice dinner which tasted really nice. Chicken was juicy and flavorful.

The highlight was suppose to be the curry with roti. I was really disappointed as this curry did not taste fresh or even like curry at all. It tastes like the curry flavored gravy you get in instant packs. And it was very starchy which makes it seem like it had been mixed with a lot of water or other ingredients. Really not much curry taste to it at all. But the roti was delicious! I just wish it came with something nicer for dipping.

I would definitely come back for appetizers or for the vermicelli/ bbq meat. Everything else, you'll just have to see for yourself :)"}
{"text":"This small pho restaurant is on Yonge, just a little south of Finch station. A friend of mine lives nearby here and recommended this restaurant for the most authentic tasting pho. I had to try it, so my girlfriend and I met up with some friends at this restaurant.

It was easy to find, the restaurant has its name in big letters, along with the address just under.

My first impressions of the place... It was quite small (but then again, around finch station, almost all the restaurants are the same size), service was friendly and I noticed they only had two sizes, small and large. Usually, at the restaurants I've been to that serve pho, there's a medium size - so I asked the server how big the portions were. Without frustration, he politely showed me the bowls they serve the small and the large in - and changed my order.

It didn't take too long for the pho to come, maybe 5-10 minutes at the most and the server didn't just assume we could all use chopsticks - he asked politely if chopsticks were okay. The pho tasted amazing, they didn't skim on the beef and for a great price. 

4/5!"}
{"text":"Great Pho, been   few times never had a bad meal! Service was quick, services were friendly."}
{"text":"THE BEST VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT. I've been to numerous Vietnamese places and I have my favourites and the ones I would never go back. But the people here are exceptional and kind. Great customer service, and there food is phenomenal. I never intended to try the roti and curry since I'm not a fan but the roti was just so good !! There's a lot of Vietnamese restaurants where they don't make good roti but this one is .. I can't even describe. Best spring rolls and raw beef soup. My boyfriend even said it was his favourite !"}
{"text":"Good and cheap $8 lunch specials and service is surprisingly good for an Asian eatery at this price-point.  It's not really a pho joint as the name would imply, more like a HK cafe (big menu selection!) that serves pho.

Grabbed the curry beef brisket on rice (they claim the 'Malay' curry as one of their specialities).  Like most Chinese joints that claim 'Malay' curry - it's just Chinese curry with some coconut milk added.  It's not bad if you hold it to that standard -- but definitely don't expect a spicy wallop from a legit Malay curry.  Decent amount of beef brisket as well.

The lady really enjoyed her veggie noodle soup which was decently spicy and peppery.

Nothing amazing but a solid choice for a quick, cheap meal in the area.  If you're looking for something a bit more refined, would recommend BCD Soon Tofu a few doors down.  But this Chinese guy would probably hit up Angus Pho House pretty regularly if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"This place is fast! I was greeted almost immediately upon entering and motioned towards a vacant table. A server arrived at the table with tea at almost exactly the same moment I did. Fast. After reading the menu for a few minutes, I was ready to order. There she was again, ready to take my order, before the menu even hit the table. Very fast.

After ordering, I went to the washroom to wash my hands. When I got back to my table it was already occupied by a couple. Even the diners are fast! No problem, I sat at the adjacent table.

Before I even had a chance to settle in and check in on Yelp, my meal arrived. It was a very generous serving of BBQ pork and a spring roll with vermicelli. The noodles were rounder than what I'm used to getting at Vietnamese restaurants, looking more like spaghetti. They were also cold, a few degrees below room temperature. Is it supposed to be that way?

In any case, it tasted good. Adding a little sriracha and hoisin sauce really kicked it up a notch. For $8.95, it was a good value, especially with the fast and friendly service.

BTW, don't go to the washroom if you don't really have to. It was not pleasant. Minus one for this rating."}
{"text":"Our go to for Friday lunches. Spicy brisket soup in their lunch specially is great. The place is small, but their food makes up for it. Service is very typical of any asian places, impersonable and quick."}
{"text":"Best Pho and viet in North York Region. Their soup is homemade, unlike most that simply adds MSG+water. I say it because Im Asian and know what trick the other restaurants are pulling.
Service is nice altho the blender can be really loud in an open area...again thats a Viet restaurant tradition.
Nice clean restaurant for daily dining. Absolutely love it."}
{"text":"This place is great. The best on yonge in my opinion, that is saying a lot considering I have tried all Pho places around the area. Angus Pho is the only Viet restaurant that I have been too where they offer Angus beef Pho for $7.99. Nothing but praise for this place. You have to try this place if you ever come across this place."}
{"text":"It's funny that the place should be called a pho house, when the pho was so mediocre lol. The broth doesn't have that concentrated, dark beef and star anise flavor to it, and there is no rare beef in the dac biet (which is supposed to be the supersize, everything's in it pho bowl). The beef itself was also below average - the cut was fatty with a weak taste. The tendon was too mushy. Stay away from the beef pho - there has to be better ones around.

The laksa was pretty good though - tasty curry-like broth with noodles that weren't too spicy, Vietnamese sausage and shrimp. I wish they would add some veggies in there, like carrots or broccoli, though, to balance out such a meat heavy dish.

Hainanese chicken - between an eh and a meh. The chicken hardly had any meat to it - mostly bone and skin. Plus, it was all dark meat. Not my style.

Service was really attentive though. Our female server was super nice - asked us about the size we wanted, how we wanted it, and circled back to ask us about the food. Definitely out of the ordinary for a predominantly Chinese restaurant (read: brusque, rude, don't really care attitude) area. She even refilled our bean sprouts for free. A+ for her. Wish I could say I'd come back because of her, but the food was so below/average that I'd say no thanks."}
{"text":"The first thing that hit me when I stepped foot in Angus Pho: the decor is simple, nice and modern.  We were quickly seated and served with tea and water.  We sticked with the staples and ordered a Spicy Beef Vermicelli Soup (Bún bò Hu), a Spring Roll and Pork Dry Vermicelli, and a Raw Beef Pho.  Everything tasted okay/decent/average.  Bun Bo Hu was mildly flavoured (it should have been spicy).  They provided me with chilli slices upfront, so they got a pass on this.  Pricing was competitive given the neighbourhood.  Services was efficient.  

The regular menu features dinner entrees, such as lemongrass chicken and pork chops, curry crab, Hainanese chicken.  I hope to return to try their dinner offering."}
{"text":"Open 'till 4AM and with some Singapore/Malay menu options - sounds too good to be true - but enough good reviews to warrant a try.  On first impression...yeah, too good to be true. 

The hostess & waiter were really nice.  In fact it's the main reason I'm giving them th second star. Anyway I want to go for Laksa to see if they're for real or just faking it ( surge in bogus Laksa these days...) but turns out they no longer offer it.  In hindsight, probably just as well.

I go for the Curry Goat on Rice instead.  Only good thing I can say was the Goat chunks were meaty (the meat-to-bone ratio can be a downer with Goat ). The curry was oily and very flat, in fact a gravy which could be described as curry-ish.  It wasn't expensive, and I wouldn't go as far as calling it gross, but definitely wouldn't have it again, even for free.

Although I found the staff very pleasant, I noticed a few service issues while I was there - bringing a wrong item to one table and a take-out customer coming back because there was no fish sauce with his order, It wasn't a busy night at all. Maybe they just had too long a shift? 

Will I give it another shot?  Probably. I work late north of Steeles and at least a couple of nights a week I need a place open after 11PM. Enough people like it i figure they gotta be good at something.  But I'm no great hurry."}
{"text":"While the service isn't horrible, there are many things that brought down my impression of this restaurant.

Service: while quite friendly and tonnes of smiles to go about, I lost a bit of interest in the food after the girl leaned over my side of the table to put down a dish on the other side. This was also bad because I had a scare each time the girl shuffled towards our table like she was about to trip, like some service act at a niche cafe. The service was also necessarily quick, since there aren't utensils, napkins, or tea placed on the table. One of two reasons why it gets a star. But they could have used bigger tables.

Food: portion sizes are large, if not out of ratio. Too much noodles, not enough soup. Also, using skin tripe instead of organ tripe is a big let down. Same with the vermicelli noodle dish. Not enough room to maneuver through the dish, and too much carb. Lastly, the only other redeeming point: the Malaysian curry. While not the real thing, the curry tastes more of peanut paste and wasn't spicy in the least, they do use the actual \"roti\". It's like the real Indian paratha, though not the kind that you see in Indian and Chinese grocery stores. Very flakey and soft yet crunchy. Only reason to come here, if not to see everyone else spill their food inevitably onto the table.

Don't know why or how they got the good reviews, but they didn't reflect the experience I've had. They must be bogus reviews, because the only thing they got right about the pho was the noodles."}
{"text":"I've heard great reviews about this place from my friends, but for the lunch specials that we ordered I think the food here is just average. 

The lunch specials are under $10 and include some fruits and a free pop (or you pay extra to upgrade for regular drinks). I checked the drinks menu, there were like 4-5 pages of them, and they are on the pricy side with the highest being $6.99 for a drink (non-alcoholic). So both me and my friend opted for the can of pop. I ordered the Vietnamese chicken and my friend got the spicy pho.

My Vietnamese chicken just wasn't good...The chicken was bland, it wasn't soft and juicy, and the rice didn't have enough chicken juice mixed in. I've definitely had more flavourful Vietnamese chicken at downtown food courts. I do like that the portion is huge and the sweet and sour veggies on the side were very appetizing. According to my friend her spicy pho wasn't really spicy at all and she said there weren't a lot of meat. 

When we went to get our bill we forgot we were still missing the fruits that were supposed to come with the lunch special and the owners didn't offer to bring them to us as well. Points off for the service."}
{"text":"It is one of my favorite Pho place in Toronto. They have their first location in Yonge and Finch. Recently open at First Markham Place. Food is as good as their first location. Broth is not very salty and doesn't taste like having a lot of msg. Service is excellent, very attentive  and the owner is very friendly and patient to introduce what food we should have. I will recommend other people to try."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It is fast,tasty and price is very reasonable. I am a regular here and I love their lemongrass chicken rice(I eat it every time, haha). The pho is also great."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A decent choice if you're in the area.  We were just looking for something fast and casual and enjoyed our dinner here.  As other reviewers have mentioned it's not really authentic Vietnamese or Malaysian, but food was tasty enough, and is great if someone in your group wants something other than Vietnamese food.  We ordered the satay beef pho and roti with curry sauce, both were enjoyable.  Satay soup is a bit different - the broth tasted more like Thai style and had julienne cucumbers and crushed peanuts, which I liked.  As I said, not super authentic but still yummy.  I asked for it with cooked beef and it was pretty tender.

PROS:

-Service was fast and above-average for what you'd expect from casual Asian restaurants.
-Serving sizes are generous - my small pho was bigger than the smalls at most other places.
-Hubby asked for an extra serving of curry sauce for his roti (if you like dips then the serving size is on the small side IMO) which the server brought quickly.  She said they usually charge for it but she would give it to us for free.  I'm not sure if they really do because the table next to us only ate half of their roti and had the other half packed up to go with extra curry sauce thrown in.
-No charge for hot tea.

CONS:

-Maybe it was just me but I wasn't sure about the cleanliness of the plastic water cups, so I asked for hot tea."}
{"text":"Just flew into the GTA late this evening and happened to come across this gem.  Authentic Vietnamese \"Saigon\" style Spring-rolls (and yes I've been there x3) were delicious and the Pho was incredible.  The place is clean and I like their attention to detail, especially the fact that they serve truly fresh bean sprouts with their soup.  

Can't wait for my next trip to the GTA, this is place is going to be my new ritual!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from Angus Pho House a few times. The food is decent, and I'm sure even better fresh... but after sitting in a car for what must be at least half an hour, the less-than-room temperature food must lose some of its quality. Still, after a quick re-zap in the microwave, most of the food is ok. The service is equally lackluster. I once asked for an extra piece of roti and was told, firstly, that it was not possible to do so without also making an order of curry (in other words, pay for another $13 bowl of curry to get the extra roti). When I spoke to a manager, I was then told it was actually $6.25 for an extra piece of roti (the cost of the roti with just curry sauce off their appetizer menu) because they \"make it themselves\". I suspect most restaurants make their own food, perhaps I am wrong? Also knowing that the BEST roti I've ever had has been \"home made\" on the street and sold for 0.50 (yes, fifty CENTS), $6.25 seems like a crazy markup, even by North American standards. I'm scared to ask what a side order of rice from this place would cost."}
{"text":"Ordered:

Roti canai with curry sauce ($7.50);
Vermicelli with pork/spring roll ($9)
Hai nan chicken with rice ($9.50)

These were not ordered as lunch specials...
meaning, their prices are based on the regular menu.
Ordered for take-out.

All mediocre in taste.

Lunch specials start at $8.95.
DINE-IN ONLY!

It is all hype, in my honest opinion.

The roti served at the foodcourt located on Steeles Ave/Ferrer Dr is better (very moist and tastier) along with their curry sauce.

The vermicelli, of course, was not authentic...I ordered it out of curiosity.

Phoenix Restaurant serves the best and authentic Hai Nan chicken.
Theirs lacked quality.

Fooled by some of these yelpers who rated this resto with 4 stars!

I don't understand why their lunch special prices are only effective for dine-in not take-out.

The place is not very spacious.

I would like to add also that there might be some dishonest tactics that are used in this resto:  
When they are out of something, they still proceed with the order at full price.
The Hai nan chicken I paid came with 5 pieces of chicken only (half compared with the photos I see here).  I came at around 1:30 pm.  My order looked as if it was divided to fulfill another order.

Thumbs down, not recommended.
Look elsewhere.  Not worth the $$$$$.
These people are not chefs, they are opportunists!"}
{"text":"Nice service. The curry jumbo shrimp is a nice try. Also recommend for the angus beef noodle~"}
{"text":"Always noticed this place every time when I pass by when in the area. This restaurant is similar to the one at FMP (First Markham Place). The menu is much or less identical to the other location. I normally go to the FMP one more as it is much closer for me and I find their portions are good value for the cost. 

Unfortunately, this Angus at Yonge and Finch didn't cut it for me. Even though they cook and serve the same kind of food in Markham, the food quality is not as good compared to their uptown location. Perhaps it's their chef who cooks the food at this location isn't very good. I had ordered the Pineapple fried rice and curry chicken. The portion of the pineapple fried rice was significantly smaller compared to Markham's and they cheaped out on the raisins!! THE RAISINS!!?  That was a total bummer... 

The curry chicken was completely different as well. This place I noticed the sauce was more gooey and thick so they probably had put too much corn starch into making the curry and wasn't good quality either..... Maybe that is why later that evening I had a bad stomach ache...... Personally, I wouldn't go back here if I wanted to eat pineapple fried rice or curry chicken. I'd much rather just go to the FMP location where the food is prepared with more attention.. 

Only perk about this place is that it is open until super late! 4AM?!! Good place for a mid night pho run if your really craving pho."}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch special, Hai Nam Chicken, $7.95 (includes your choice of pop)

Food:
Chicken was juicy and the rice was a little seasoned (not the best I've tasted). But overall, it was delicious. 

The portion: Very large and super filling. 

The price: Lunch specials is super decent (especially in North York)

Note: I came a few years ago when they first opened. The price was good, and the a few months later they raised their prices to around $13-16 per entree. I stopped going and then recently went back this weekend (sept 2017) and found they've lowered their prices."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite restaurants to go. While I go here mostly for pho, the menu has something for everyone. They have a good selection southeast asian dishes like curry, pad thai, hai nam chicken and pineapple fried rice.  I have been here many times and not once have I been disappointed. 

Their pho is the best I've had. I am very sensitive about meat having smell but this place uses fresh meat and ingredients.  The broth they make is very clear and tasty.  The price and portions are comparable to other pho restaurants but what sets this place apart is they use Angus beef which makes it even more worth it for the price.  The staff here is very friendly and courteous as well.  They also open until very late (at 4am!) so it's the ideal spot for late night eats.  I definitely recommend this place for all the true pho lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best broth that I've had. Will return if I'm in the area!

Staff: They are very nice and understanding when we came in with a large party. Took our orders in a timely manner and our food came quick.

Ambience: There isn't anything noteworthy in terms of decor. Walls are white, with one tv playing ads. The tables are all different but alright for seating. 

Food: I had the Spring Rolls as an appetizer which I felt was overpriced at $6 for two spring rolls (I'm used to getting 3 rolls). My main I had a Chicken and Sausage Rice Noodle Soup. Not going to lie, I didn't realize it wasn't Pho until I got it but the dish was good because the broth was amazing. It was fatty and salty but not too fatty and not too salty. I normally don't drink much of the broth but this time I was drinking it well after eating all the noodles. Chicken was juicy and not dry as well. 

Great food and staff, just wish it was priced differently and had better furnishing."}
{"text":"3.5/5

I honestly would've given this place 4 stars if the current rating was not 4.5/5. It's a good restaurant, but it is nowhere close to 4.5/5 in my books.

However, I would still recommend this restaurant for those in the Willowdale area cause it's probably the only Pho place around here that does the tomato beef brisket noodle soup well. Also mind you, come here only if you're hungry; I was about half hungry and couldn't even finish a small!

My dad ordered the satay beef noodle soup. One thing to note, this place isn't truly authentic Vietnamese. The satay sauce they use is more of a Thai style. Also, while I didn't look at the kitchen, the servers were Chinese and Korean. Still, if you like spicy, it's an excellent choice! The beef is also of good quality, both the sliced and the brisket. The noodles, however, were not really silky, which means they're not of the highest quality. There's not too many restaurants that offer the silky kind nowadays (Kim Po Scarborough is the only one that comes to mind), but the smoother the texture, the better the noodle in my opinion.

Service was polarized. The male server was very good, however the female server was poor in the sense we had to mention the order to her three times, then when we asked that we wanted the bean sprouts cooked (raw sprouts aren't good for you as they aren't washed), she didn't know what we were saying.

Overall a decent restaurant, but not the 4.5/5 rating Yelp currently has."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Got the curry and roti and it was  delicious, full of flavour"}
{"text":"This place has really improved in the past couple of years since renovating.  The service is good and fairly quick. The food is yummy plus generally value too.  The atmosphere is very casual and it probably seats approximately 30-35 people or so.  They serve various types of Asian cuisine here, but primarily Vietnamese, including pho, vermicelli, Vietnamese-style spring rolls (deep fried rice rolls!), curry and roti, and other dishes.

I went with my husband who ordered the pho lunch special (also available on weekends), I ordered the kalbi vermicelli, and we shared a side of spring rolls. The spring rolls were quite pricey ($6.95 for two) but if you order a lunch special (such as the pho) then you can get the spring rolls for $4.95.  I wouldn't order the kalbi vermicelli again just because I know they have better dishes and the kalbi was so thin and overcooked.  I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt that they are just not good at making kalbi like at the Korean restaurants near by and they specialize in other dishes. Also, I love that their vermicelli (\"bun\" in Vietnamese) is the thicker kind and not the really thin ones like most places!

I'm looking forward to my next visit to Angus Pho House and trying some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"This place deserves a five star just on their customer service! They're delivery is always in good time and always so polite. I've ordered about 8 times. Once they made a small error of forgetting my soft drinks and beef balls and I called to tell them it's \"okay\" only for them to tell me their driver is already on the way. Food is also very good! I love their pho beef balls, curry fish balls, and lemon grass chicken."}
{"text":"Pho yes, hoi nan chicken rice pretty good, laksa could be better since it had more soup than ingredients and lastly curry pork chop rice ... no.  I've had better curry in foodcourt better than this place.  There was no balance in the ingredients as it was literally pork chop + curry.  No vegetables.  If i can describe a first at this restaurant, it is a first time tasting sweet curry"}
{"text":"5 star for service and efficiency, 4 star for value, 3.5 stars for taste. I was so excited that this restaurant offers delivery. Ive ordered delivery multiple times and food have always arrived before due time, and the delivery person is always courteous.  Portion is also huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food great service ordered noodles and pretty much everything I need for lunch. A small bowl is enough for me. And the price is not expensive"}
{"text":"Probably the best pho place I've been to, and I've been to Pho Hung and Hanoi 3 Seasons and multiple Pho 88 locations. Their broth is delicious, and achieves its flavour without MSG, which helps me feel better after guzzling back the broth. Their portions are generous, and the quality of their meat is quite nice. They also deliver, as long as you don't live too far away. I'll sometimes order multiple pho dishes, and then eat off them for days. It's so good, it's hard to get tired of it :)

You don't go here for the cheapest Vietnamese place in the city. You go here if you're looking for high quality. The house special and the pork hock is always good, but the tom yum broth is also surprisingly tasty. Not as fond of the tomato brisket though. If you're feeling a little adventurous, order the roti dish. It's delicious, but you have to be in the mood for something really rich."}
{"text":"I love it.. it's really good an delicious. The place is not too big, people there are very friendly,, We had \"satay beef noodle\" small..(Which is actually BIG). and beef rips, and chicken curry.. We love it.. and defiantly will go again.."}
{"text":"Angus Pho is my fav pho restaurant in the Yonge and Finch area.  It's definitely a go to spot when I don't feel like cooking and want a quick meal.

Pros:
Food is consistently good
Portions are good
Delivery is available

Cons:
Spring rolls are 6 bucks..
Parking can be tough to find

I'll be honest, I've only eaten in the restaurant once.  I've mostly do pick up and delivery the rest of time.  I never had a disappointing experience here. 

The food is always pretty good here.  It may not be the best, but it's consistently up there.  The Pho is good, with good portions for whatever size you order.  My gf always gets the vermicelli which she says is pretty good.  My fav is the Hainan Chicken rice. Their ginger and onion sauce that comes with it is by far one of the best I've had.
Everything is well priced here except for the spring rolls in my opinion.  I love these things but 6 bucks for 2 rolls hurts a little.    

So like I said, they offer delivery if you're in the area which is a plus.  Sometimes you just have a tough day and getting comfort food like pho delivered to you helps!  Also, this place being on Yonge Street, parking is hit or miss.  You could be better off walking or getting delivery like I do.

Angus Pho will not disappoint you.  The two guys who work there are very cool and polite.  I've never had a problem here and neither should you."}
{"text":"Angus Pho House is actually one of the best, if not, only good Pho noodle house in the Yonge & Finch neighbourhood.   So, this is why I am giving it a 5 stars because it is the only place in the Willowdale area that I like and feels, serves the freshest Vietnamese Beef Pho.   I don't know what authentic is.  I just know that they make a pretty good broth with fresh cuts of meats (very important) and NO MSG.   Be sure to check whether they have the fresh rice noodles in house.  Sometimes, they are sold out.   It is the best compared to the dried rice noodles.  

They have other tasty items on the menu too, the hainanese chicken rice and the beef brisket curry roti.  

They also do delivery, which is what I absolutely LOVE, because restaurants like these normally don't have that service.  

I hope they stay in this neighbourhood for a long time because we are seriously lacking good Pho Noodle houses around this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My sister, her fiancé and I went for a late bite the other night. We ordered the fresh rolls to start which were big, delicious, and fresh. We all ordered the Tom Yum Seafood as our entre and all enjoyed it very much. The spice level was perfect and the new was plenty of seafood and fish balls. The reason for the four starts was that beef was found in both mine and my sisters seafood soup. 
Our server was apologetic and discounted our meals. 
We really enjoyed the food and the service and will be back again despite the beef situation."}
{"text":"Been here many times for their 7.95 lunch specials. Both the pho and cold vermicelli with BBQ pork are pretty good. Service is like any typical Vietnamese restaurant though so don't expect too much. The restaurant is nice and tidy with some cute paintings on the walls. 

This time I got the house special pho - comes with a good amount of raw beef, tendon, beef balls, and beef brisket. Broth is flavourful and for a small, it's a decent portion."}
{"text":"Very polite and close to detail service and food preparation.  We had the Curry Jumbo Shrimp and Special Beef noodle soup and they are very good."}
{"text":"Pho and other Vietnamese food are decent. Don't bother ordering Thai food here. Tried Tom yum soup noodle and it was bitter and I could taste the Tom yum powder in the soup. Needless to say, that dish went unfinished."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sauté beef pho. Great service and will come back again. It's not fancy but its a good place to go if you're hungry. Be prepared the large pho is huge!"}
{"text":"I had the laksa, was craving a good laksa for a long time. Broth was full and flavourful I would have preferred a bit more spice though. 

Staff are great, always topping up our tea. 

Food was fresh and perfect to soothe a cold body in the winter!"}
{"text":"I went here, because it was one of the few pho places open at midnight. The lady running the joint is a beauty, but no Vietnamese beauty, which was a huge sign that it wasn't going to beat pho from a viet place (can't tell the nationality of the owners/chefs before the first visit). 

Had Takeout. I always do pho takeout, so when these guys actually gave me a nice bowl to dine with, which never happens, made it heartwarming and memorable. 

I always judge the pho by the soup, which immediately disappointed me. It was inoffensive, not completely unauthentic, but very weak. The full flavor of the soup did not kick in until all the condiment flavors were infused in the last few sips. The beef is mercilessly tenderized by chemical tenderizers, and I hate that. The rest of the soup was great.

Now that I've finished the pho, as mentioned by another reviewer, I sense that not only was the soup unlively, the cooking process definitely went through shortcuts. 
Must be MSG or something, because my mouth is numb, and my stomach is complaining. As a Chinese person, I'm very sad to say that this is another case of dishonest Chinese cooking. Every Chinese bootleg of pho had been relatively disappointing in one way or another. Too bad.

{"text":"If you can get over the smell of wet rags, the pho and shrimp rolls weren't all that bad."}
{"text":"Big portions. Fair pricing. Flavourful dishes. Good service (aside from ordering over the phone if the new young server picks up in that case get ready to repeat your address 7 times). Fast delivery (unless the young girl waiter took your order). Will always go there regardless. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for pho recently, we ordered a small and a large.  Decent portions for both sizes.  It was okay except the broth (which is the heart of it all) was not really a pho broth.  Was it bad? Nope.  But it tasted like regular meat soup with a hint of pho-ness to it.  So if I wanted a non spicy beef noodle soup (apparently everything in the area is spicy noodles now) this would be great but what I wanted at the time was that true Viet pho broth and this was just too pho-ney...pun intended.

Place is owned by Chinese people if this matters to anyone.

{"text":"Great value for money! And food was pretty good. Waitresses are very nice and courteous. I would love to come back"}
{"text":"The broth for the pho is very flavourful but the noodles are only decent. I really love the rare beef that comes with the pho! Even though the pho was satisfying it doesn't match up to my standards for an amazing bowl of pho. The milkshakes here are also super watered down. Even though it's claimed to be made with real fruit I really think they cheap out on the ingredients for the drinks. The service is amazing here and they only accept cash or debit! The portions are also very generous for pho.. I couldn't finish my small bowl."}
{"text":"We live close by so it's our go-to spot for roti & curry, as well as pho. Must say that as of recently, roti size has gotten significantly smaller and prices have increased - it is clear that they've adjusted their menu. Pho is consistently decent but we noticed the beef curry has less of a coconut flavour compared to before. They've added more types of curries to their menu, including a \"Malaysian\" curry so perhaps what used to be the regular curry is now considered the Malaysian curry however I haven't tried the Malaysian curry yet so I can't say for sure. 

This place overall quite good, but was much better before the price adjustment. I suspect some recipes were tweaked as well which has changed the flavour of the beef curry. We will continue to return due to the convenient location however our visits are less frequent because of the change in prices."}
{"text":"I have nothing but applause applause applause because I'm gaga for this resto!!! Love that it's so close to home and it never disappoints our pho loving and now roti craving moments (wait, both cravings satisfied under one roof??!) yeah! Genius!!!

Great portions, fresh soup base, spring rolls are crunchy and the jumbo curry shrimp is my all time fave after the angus pho!!!! Monstrous alien looking creature dipped in golden curry, you don't even notice the bed of noodles it comes in. 

All glorified in the right amount of seasoning and the roti!?? Flaky, hot and crispy and soft at the same time, orgasmic dipping experience until it's all gone and you're left wondering why you didn't order 2 from the get go!

Servers here are secretly gifted with Einstein's brain capacity. They took my order more than twice without any writing apparatus. Memory game was their mojo which increases anticipation if they can pull off this 6 item order.

At first, my little one said \"Ha!!! Mom they did get it wrong, they brought out a baby lobster instead of a shrimp!!\" Beet red she turned on finding out the latter of her reaction but kudos to this shrimp sharply dressed up for an affair in my stomach."}
{"text":"Angus Pho House unfortunately doesn't live up to its Yelp rating. 

They forgot our appetisers and messed up one of the main courses, forgetting to exclude chicken from the pad thai even after they had been told that one of my friends only eats halal. They quickly rectified their mistake, but I can't be sure if they cooked the pad thai afresh or simply removed the chicken from the original serving.

My goat brisket was 99% fat and uninspired. My friend did not like his pho at all.

The best part about the restaurant: the Vietnamese murals on the walls."}
{"text":"Such a great surprise!!! 
The house pho had really delicious soup, and the noodles were slightly chewy! It was also a pretty huge portion. But we were able to finish it because it tasted so good.
I also tried the fish cake appetizer and it was also reallyyy good, had a thin slightly crunchy outer layer and inside it was chewy!
The goat roti was probably one of the best surprises. Really flavorful and the roti was perfect. 

Really glad to have tried it and will definitely be back! I saw they have fresh coconuts in their drink section and I'm excited to try that next time too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy day. Ordered a rare beef pho as well as a Spicy beef noodle soup. Not the best pho I have tried. Was not impressed with the spicy plate due to the fact that it was not spicy and did not have much flavour to it. However my friend really enjoyed his regular pho. The portion sizes are huge for 2 smalls. That is always a plus. It is a small place so expect a wait during busier hours. Enjoyed my meal but still searching for a go to pho place around the area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place to eat in the Yonge and Finch area! My husband and I always get their Hainan chicken rice and the chicken curry with roti. These dishes are cooked to such perfection that we can't seem to order anything else on the menu. The staff is friendly as well and decent amount of seating for a restaurant joint that size. Food also comes very quickly as well."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time. Food was very good but portion was a bit small. I think the sauces are not the ones I usually get for some of the menu items. My friend had to wait for his meal so it was a bit turnoff."}
{"text":"Must try: Curry Chicken with Roti

This place is always solid every time I go. My favorite thing is the roti, which is soft and buttery. You can pair it with anything and it would be great.

The lemongrass chicken is very flavorful and tender, but the rice at this place left something to be desired. 

I have tried the pho before and it was pretty good, nothing mind blowing but comforting as pho tends to do.

{"text":"We ordered take out from here last weekend (5 adults). While I liked the dishes with vermicelli, I didn't like the beef brisket with tomato sauce & rice dish. Also we ordered the party tray for the spring rolls but they looked small compared to our fave pho place (Pho Vietnam in Scarborough). The fried rice was okay as well. I find most of the dishes over-seasoned. Lots of salt & other spices. I like a light touch with seasoning on the side so I can customize the dish to my taste. So while the food was decent we'll keep trying other places in the neighbourhood to find a better pho place near here."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch.  We got the lunch special which were reasonable prices that comes with a pop/lemon or milk hot tea or you can upgrade to shakes for $3.50.  We ordered the tomato beef brisket with rice which was very good.  However, I was a bit disappointed with my BBQ chicken, spring roll, shrimp cane vermicelli.  It was a good portion with a very tasty spring roll but the vermicelli was hard."}
{"text":"I went to Angus Pho House and ordered a large Pho during the lunch hour.

The large size is about the same size as their closest competitor's small size a block north on Yonge Street, but the waitress offered to bring extra soup as I was taking in more soup than noodles.  Very cool but I didn't accept...that is still a lot of liquid!

The soup stock is full bodied and well made, seemingly with very little MSG if any is added.  The amount of noodles really is plentiful and the meat is plentiful.  

The service is attentive and friendly.

I will return for sure as this is a very good Pho place."}
{"text":"Back again, tried a large with extra meat... please roll me to my car...

Quality, quantity, and service still top notch!"}
{"text":"If there's anything you MUST try, it's their roti and curry. Rip pieces of the roti and dip them into the curry to eat. I suggest only ordering this and adding more curry or roti as you run out. 

We ordered the beef brisket with curry and roti (106), lemongrass beef short ribs (006), and angus beef pho (021). The pho and short ribs were average. The four stars given is for their roti and curry so make sure you get it!!

The prices are super affordable here. Don't forget to get 10% off by downloading their app!"}
{"text":"Food - great pho place. Above average for what it is. I ordered pho with beef tendon and beef ball Thai style with a side of roti with curry. The soup base is very light yet tasty. Just the right amount of flavour. The Thai style makes it spicy. Didn't have to add anything to it. Highly recommend if you're a fan of spice. Very flavourful!! Highly recommend.

The roti is one of my favourite things on the menu. GET IT. The roti is crispy and flaky on the outside and soft when you bite in to it. The curry sauce is very strong in flavour. Even my friend who wasn't a big fan of curry enjoyed it (so it says a lot). Just try it.

Location- alongside the busy Korean town part of Yonge. Park alongside the side streets. It's pay for parking. 

Service - it was just alright. 1-2 servers at the time. When the Restaurant got really packed you'd have to constantly flag them down for things like napkins (they don't have napkins on the table... they only give you like 3...and with roti it gets messy!)

VERDICT- my new pho go to place! Love it."}
{"text":"This place is it for Pho alot of variety of dishes. If you like noodles it's more meat & noodles then soup. Dishes are big & the prices are pretty good. If your on Yonge st stop by & try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a very small restaurant that is very popular during weekday lunches. Front of house is taken care of by a Chinese lady and she's very quick and friendly, a gentleman also helps her out when things get busy. The portion was generous, the broth was good, but there really wasn't much meat and it seems like the noodles weren't quite fresh. It was still delicious though. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My family tried this place recently and we were pleasantly surprised. We are vietnamese and we're looking for authentic Vietnamese made and this came pretty close. Pho broth is sometimes good and sometimes bland. It seem like the owners are Chinese but food tasted pretty good. It's a bit different with the spicy pho options but I'll take it. Also the roti is not vietnamese but it's yummy and crispy roti so sure, we'll have some. We would go here again, a little pricey and small inside but close to our house. Milkshake is $6.95?!!! Too expensive."}
{"text":"I went there unplanned with a colleague. We were hungry and just passed by this place. We didn't have much expectation at first and ordered a House Special Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Large) and this curry chicken + roti. OMG, their roti is SOOO good! That's all I remember. I will have to go back and try again if it's that good (or if it's because I was too hungry that night ha ha)."}
{"text":"Beware of the bogus reviews on Yelp!!!!

This restaurant is a big joke; I am questioning the \"sanity\" of the cook and management; I have a feeling that they serve leftovers to their customers.

If there is Fake news, well....this restaurant serves Fake food (not representative of what is on the menu).

Total waste of money:
ordered vermicelli/pork/spring roll;
Roti with chicken curry, and
Hai Nan chicken with rice.

Worse than mediocre!"}
{"text":"My favourite:
Roti & Tom Yum Noodles.

Portions are huge, the tom yum noodle and roti are full of flavour, and the price is good. Avocado milkshake - the one time I ordered it, it was too watery. It would have tasted really good if it was creamier. 

Restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, and best of all service is fast!"}
{"text":"Honestly, whenever I come here, I order anything BUT the pho. Don't get me wrong, their pho isn't terrible; but it isn't anything to write home about. The portions are very generous but the broth leaves much to be desired. I hope my opinion may be swayed when I return to try subbing their broth for satay---a recent and after the meal discovery.

Where Angus Pho excels, I find, is in their other dishes. In particular, I find their Hainanese chicken and curry with roti to be excellent. The Hainanese chicken is not too fatty, with flavourful and tender meat. It's served with pickled carrots/daikon, ginger/green onion dip, and a side of fragrant rice (do NOT order the one without rice---yes it is more chicken but you NEED the rice). Any of their curries are crave-worthy and combined with their crispy roti creates a mouthwateringly unctious combination of fragrant, meaty, spicy, and crispy.

Their avocado shake is also above average. Overall, pretty much ritual-worthy."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about eating Vietnamese food around the Yonge and Finch area because of past bad experiences with other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.  I decided to play it safe with this one by ordering the lemongrass pork chop on rice.  My wife had the beef satay noodle.  Our dishes came out super quick and to my surprise, my dish tasted very good! The pork was very well marinated and tender.  The dish came with 2 big pieces of porkchop.  The only gripe I had was that they supplied very little pickled vegetables and salad which is needed to help balance out the meal.  Also, the dish didn't come with a soup on the side which most authentic Vietnamese restaurants provide when you order this dish.  But I guess you can't compare because this restaurant was run by Chinese people.  Next time I will try their pho and see how it compares to an authentic Vietnamese restaurant.  Angus Pho House, *insert Arnold's voice\" I'LL BE BACK !"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this place a shot, especially cause I was craving soup. The seafood soup is very spicy and delicious. If you order take out/delivery the seafood broth comes in a separate bowl and you can add as much of it to the noodle as you like.  The sweet and sour chicken was just alright, nothing special to note. The pad thai has a generous amount of chicken and shrimp and tastes great. I got free coupons for Spring Rolls, and Roti with curry sauce for my next visit."}
{"text":"This is a somewhat non-description pho restaurant in the inner corner of the First Markham Place plaza. Their signature is the angus beef they use in their noodles. I didn't find it that special or any better than other pho but that being said, the food quality is decent overall. The curry chicken with roti was actually better than the pho! The seating is a bit crammed but I guess it's typical of a lot of pho places."}
{"text":"Surrounded by korean restaurants in Yonge and Finch, Angus Pho House is a good alternative for those who live in that area and are sick of sushi and bi bi bamp.

The pho is generally pretty good, I like to go for the satay for a little kick in my soup. They are generous with the protein. I asked for the rare beef on the side and they give me a mountain my beef to dump in my soup.

The only thing is that I question the sanitary in this place. I got a stomach ache almost right after.

Aside from the stomach pain, the food is overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"Angus Pho House's second location newly opens in First Markham Place. https://www.yelp.ca/biz/angus-pho-house-toronto

I never been to their location in North York but their Markham location is quite decent. Decor is clean and simple, service is fast and friendly.

Oxtail Noodle Soup Thai Style ($8.95) huge portion for a small. Oxtail is plentiful but kind of dry because it was sliced into really really thin pieces. I probably will skip this next time.

House Special Stired Fried Noodle ($11.95) really nicely done with great flavour. A hint of spiciness and shrimp paste. I like how they use the really thin vermicelli and not oily at all.

Spring Rolls ($6.95) was A-OK too.

These may not be the most authentic Vietnamese food, more like Asian Fusion but not a bad option if you want something filling and comforting!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves amazing Malaysian and Vietnamese dishes! My family ordered multiple dishes here and every dish was delicious and tasty. I recommend the goat curry with rotti, hainanese chicken with rice, and pho noodles soup! We had a lot more dishes that were equally good but I don't remember the name so I will attach pictures. On top of the amazing food they have, their customer service was also on point. Both times we came, the waitress there was super nice. She was patient with us and gave us good recommendations. The food was served quick even when the whole restaurant was packed. Overall, I highly recommend this place and will certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night at about 8pm. The location wasn't hard to find as it's just along Yonge St. and the place was not busy.

I had the rare beef pho (in the soup) which was good, but wasn't spectacular. The only thing I could tell is that the beef was a bit leaner and perhaps they used less msg than other larger chain pho places.

The place was nice, clean, small  and seats about 10 or so tables I'd say. Owners are Chinese And speak Cantonese.

They make a good pho, and have other cuisine on their menu like Thai.

This place is overall good and I would eat here again, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to have pho here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and extremely fast service (depends on what you're ordering I guess?). I ordered the beef flank pho, which came really fast. My husband ordered lemongrass chicken, and he really liked it. It was flavourful and tender. It didn't take long for his meal either. For apps, we ordered spring rolls and fish balls, which took longer to arrive than our main meals, but that was fine with us. Both were really good."}
{"text":"been there 3 times. The foods okay. service needs some serious work."}
{"text":"these guys do a good job .. pho and spicy beef noodle soup were both pretty good."}
{"text":"Good decent pho in this area.  It's about the broth and it's delicious - you can taste the flavours had been boiling for hours.  Good sized servings and a nice menu with not much of everything else.  Keeping it simple with a classic Hunan chicken to classic house pho.  I would say the best in the area."}
{"text":"First pho experience, but DELICIOUS! 

Angus Pho house is a small, casual place on yonge street. The service is good, and the staff are all friendly. 

I got the beef Satay soup which was delicious' HUGE portions! A small size is HUGE! 

Tip: first time I went I didn't know what to order so I got the house special. Wrong choice for me as it had all the parts of the animal like stomach, which wasn't appetizing for me. Basically, order anything except the house special and your good :)"}
{"text":"What!  What's pho without bean sprouts!!!!  Yet that was what we were told when we proceeded to order the house special.  They ran out.  It wouldn't have mattered if they substituted the sprouts for other ingredients instead, but they shut that idea down.  The bowls of pho came pretty quickly, and they were generous in portions although there weren't anything too special about the taste.  Just no sprouts.   Who knew we were that attached to the bean sprouts!  Despite no sprouts and no substitutions, the prices remained sadly unchanged."}
{"text":"We were just looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night and came across Angus pho house. We walked in and had to wait about ten minutes for a table because it was busy (first hint the food would be good). We sat down, we were a party of 7 so we got house special pho beef noodle soup, satay beef noodle soup, some spring rolls, and an order of curry and roti, and beef brisket curry with roti. 

The spring rolls were ok, nothing to call home about. The soups were good, full of flavour and what you would expect from a good pho place. To me though the highlight was the curry and roti. The roti was amazing, It was thicker than your regular roti, but at the same time oh so good to pick up the curry. The curry was rich and so tasty I could have eaten it with just a spoon. Favourite dish of the night! 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Still delicious. Pho broth is very tasty. Roti I find too greasy as it is fried. Wish it could be baked. The curry is delicious.  Tried the pad Thai and that is a favourite too. Only complaint is they need to clean the chicken better. Too much cartilage."}
{"text":"The North York Food alley (Yonge and Sheppard to Yonge and Finch) has seen the gastronomic landscape in a constant state of flux.  Eateries come and eateries go.
Angus Pho House quietly opened a while ago, and for the first time, I checked-in and had a meal.  I normally go next door to the Soon Tofu place.
For our meal, we ordered the Angus Pho - of course, Lemongrass Short Ribs, Chicken Curry, Cold Rolls and Spring Rolls.
The Pho was good and the beef was quite edible.  Lots of time, we eat the noodle and leave all the meat at the bottom of the bowl.  Also, this is one place that the difference in size for small and large pho is very apparent.  The big bowl totally eclipsed the smaller serving.
For the rolls, the spring roll was enjoyable but the cold rolls were less than stellar.  Furthermore, the lemongrass ribs were also a disappointment - over fried, thin, and kind of tasteless.
I was also expecting better for the chicken curry.  There were generous portions of meet and potatoes, however, it tasted like any other dish from a Chinese restaurant and not a Vietnamese one.
Though not a complete success for a first time meal, the place is efficient, friendly, and somewhat economical.  It would be on retry list."}
{"text":"Came to Angus after our original choice was closed with a boyfriend who was having a serious Asian craving and we were not disappointed. I was a little worried when there wasn't anyone in the restaurant, but quickly realized that it was pretty early on a Sunday. The place filled up considerably before we left.

Ordered the goat curry with roti, a large beef satay, and spring rolls, and went home with enough food for at least two or three more meals. All for under $40! The goat curry had amazing flavour - cinnamon maybe, but was a little on the fatty side? The roti was thicker than the normal tortilla-like texture that I'm used to, but a perfect compliment to the curry. The beef satay was a great, slightly spicier alternative to a traditional pho and I was very happy that I got to have it a few more times over the next few days.

Overall, Angus had some very unique flavours for a great price."}
{"text":"This place serves pretty decent pho.. I have to admit the quantities are very generous and prices are very low. A very attractive pho establishment to students in the area. Taste wise it's also not bad. The broth is very msg-y. Like it tastes good but there's not much actual depth in terms of herbal and meat scents. Also the ingredient qualities aren't the best. Fatty cuts of meat. If you get any type of seafood noodle it's mostly fishcakes and imitation crab meat lol. Big perk is that it's open til around 2am. So if you were in the area for some drinks and want pho, this is the place to go. Solid 7/10"}
