{"text":"New owners + new help = DISASTER!  Went to celebrate friends anniversary and ended up with poor service and poor food.  2 entree salads ordered with salmon arrived with chicken.  Another entree arrived barely warm.  Waitperson was rather in attentive.  Mgr's handling of the situation was inadequate.  Too bad as it use to be a nice local restaurant.  Doubt we will be back to suffer thru this type of an amateur's attempt at running a restaurant."}
{"text":"Just moved to Scottsdale AZ.  My husband and I went for dinner on a Saturday night.  Had an amazing server, food was awesome and for a change we did not over pay like you do at every Scottsdale AZ restaurant.  Will be back in a heartbeat!!!"}
{"text":"Good food but HORRIBLE service from the start. We were never waited on outside so we moved inside--no apology--and got worse from there. We were never checked on before or after our meal. After waiting forever I had to bring our cards up to the bar so we could cash out. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Out of yesterday's meatloaf?  Eeew!  New neighborhood spot for us, my date and i were looking forward to checking it out (in spite of mixed reviews on Yelp).  First, the name . . . Rock and Vine seems a little bit of a ripoff of the nearby restaurant Rhythm & Wine.   Came in on a weeknight, with about 10 minutes left on happy hour. Decor was nice but bar stools were uncomfortable.  Bartender said she only had enough happy hour red for one glass left.  Strange--how about opening up another bottle for your customers so that both can both have red wine at the happy hour price?  Didn't press the issue and went for the white.   The happy hour menu overall was not very impressive, mostly fried food (usual at most happy hours), so we tried the regular menu.  The Green Chile Meatloaf looked good, but when I went to order it, the bartender told me that they ran out of it . . yesterday.  Eeew . . . Who wants to eat yesterday's meatloaf?  And when was yesterday's meatloaf made--two days ago, three?   Thought I'd be safe with the chicken sandwich.  My date ordered the olive burger.  Both were pretty good, so no complaints there.  Good fries too.  So, would I go back?  Not sure.   But I know I'll be heading back to Rhythm & Wine.  Because they would have opened another bottle of red for us!"}
{"text":"We went in Friday early evening. Thought we would check out what looked like a fresh new place.  Atmosphere in the restaurant felt modern and cool but also intimate. Had the chicken pasta as well as the onion rings, as an appetizer.  The chicken was perfectly season and juicy, the whole dish was fresh and healthy...which was a nice balance to the also delicious onion rings.  Caught the end of happy hour. I had a $3.50 Corona, but I was told the beer specials will rotate. The service was great and we'll definitely be coming back and suggesting friends check it out too."}
{"text":"I think  the place is now called something else? Grape vine bistro I believe. It's just an adorable comfortable chic place. That always has fun music playing over head while a TV close by in the bar that we can see from our booths with whatever games. At the same time people watching through the doors to patio.   We have been there twice in the last 3 months and looooveedd it each time. I def plan on going back! The last time we were there it was a menu change with a new chef.    Ryan the manager was there as always greeting us and very accommodating. We couldn't remember which wine we had last time that we enjoyed and both our server and Ryan encouraged and brought over some samples to taste to help us remember. I thought that was a great touch. We just the other day passed by on our way to the dentist and Ryan saw us, remembered us and waved hello.   That evening we enjoyed the soup which was a delicious tomato basil. So good! My fianc√© always gets one of their salads pre dinner. Never disappoints. Ample portion well seasoned with a clean presentation.   The big surprise the evening was our entrees. My honey got the delicious, lick your fingers good ribs with  Mac and cheese along with an excellent corn bread (not everyone should attempt corn bread as some can and some can't get it right) they got it right.  Immediately I had plate envy.   Well until I got my plate. Seafood pasta. Instead of clams I asked if they could please omit them and if they felt good about it maybe throw me an extra shrimp or scallop?? Oh my gosh. This plate was incredible! I am super picky about scallops and the way they are cooked and the size. They were the larger kind, pan seared with an excellent crust and generous! My shrimp was the same. I could not believe it. All sitting beautifully on a bed of pasta with seasoning that was just right. My only complaint if any with this dish was it came with 3 toast points. Looked gorgeous but the toasted bread needed jazzing up some. It was just sliced and placed under the broiler. Could have brushed with sea salt and Olive oil? Just because it was kind of bland.   Because my meal was so satisfying and ample portion we did not see or get to try the desserts. We will the next time and I sure hope it's just as delicoius.   Service is great. Not too much. Not too little with Ryan ever present. He is a rare manager who is comfortable checking in with his tables. Some places are awkward doing it. The ocean club is one, they do it but like perfunctory. Jade palace -the por manager checks in but our service and dinner that evening was just a disaster so when he asked if it was ok he answered for us himself-how is everything? perfect? Ok great and walked away. We both cracked up as it was just horrible and said never mind. That's not the case here. It's personal, yet private. Great job team! Thank you"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow service, and a rude manager. You'd be well served to avoid this place and eat across the way at Lamp."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant!  I frequent this restaurant about once a week.  The food is fabulous.  I love the soups, they are made daily and are are wonderful.  The Caesar salad is excellent with just the perfect amount of dressing.  The Dover sole is delicious and I truly enjoy the chicken on a skewer with basmati rice pilaf.  Everything I have ordered has been very tasty.  The owners and staff are very welcoming and friendly.  I love  the way they have decorated too.  This restaurant has great ambiance.  I definitely recommend.  The bar is fun and inviting as well. A must try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has wonderful food!  I was pleasantly surprised.  Great ambiance.  I would definitely recommend it over other restaurants in the area.  I have lived in this area for 8 years and have yet to find a favorite spot.....I do think I have found it."}
{"text":"We had a similar experience as another guest on November 26, 2014.  We have been regulars to this once delightful neighborhood restaurant.  Initially we had the same servers with the new ownership, but  then we noticed that the portions were smaller.  The Dover Sole dish is less than half the serving which Rock & Vine served.  The pureed cauliflower was a \"garnish\" the last time I ordered this dish.  The menu calls out vegetables - I hardly think one half of a baby carrot is a serving of vegetables.  We waited for our salads for one hour, and  the wait person was absent except to ask if we wanted more to drink.  It was not a pleasant evening and I doubt we will be back - at least not for awhile."}
{"text":"Visiting my family for the birth of my first nephew in Scottsdale. Second time I've come to this place with my mom (she lives down the street) and both times have been AWESOME. Service was great. They know how to make (and serve!) a really Moscow mule (cup and all) and the food was all literally perfect. Not a complaint. As a person who grew up in the restaurant business I can confidently say that this place can and should and will last. They will have my business as long as they're there. Love it."}
{"text":"There is a place down the road called Soul Cafe, well this place should be called  The Souless Cafe. Poor ambience, very dark, quiet customers and the whole atmosphere was eerie. Few customers seems to be the trend here. However the food was very good, ribs excellent, as were the 2 hamburgers we ordered. Service ok, quick to top up drinks , clarified all the orders, offered options. No problem there. Good wine and martini lists. Worth a try if you like quiet places with no atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pretty great lunch!  Not very crowded, which was nice.  The food is tops and the place looked great.  It's upscale, so expect to pay a little more... BUT, you get what you pay for!  Not terribly expensive for what you get..."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way: I'd go back, but it's not a must. Food was good, and there's a wide selection of choices, but there's nothing really special or noteworthy about the place. So, it's A-OK, but no yays or woo-hoos here."}
{"text":"Just left dinner here for a date night. Very pleasant. The restaurant is decorated so well with wine bottles displayed and beautiful lighting. So it is a romantic setting. Seating indoors or outdoors.   Our waitress was very helpful with recommendations and very personable. She knew a lot about each wine and food items.   We got the caprese salad appetizer. Very fresh and the tomatoes were just perfect!  Then I got the filet salad which had a small portion size of meat unfortunately. However it was cooked just right and the dressing was awesome!!  My boyfriend got the pork chops and he ate every last bite. They were so delicious!!   Overall we loved it. Would have been nice to have live music there since it's called rock and vine. But maybe we went on the wrong night.  Lovely time. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to see a new restaurant opening up in the neighborhood. I ordered the calamari appetizer  and a basil martini. The calamari was pretty good and so was the martini. The reason I'm only giving 1 star is that the martini glass was not filled to the top and when I finished it the bartender walk over to the leftover drink and instead of refilling my glass she drank it! Needless to say I didn't stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Went to a Rock and Vine for dinner a couple of times. Every time the food is fantastic. The calamari and French onion soup is to awesome. Great place for dinner."}
{"text":"Friend of mine wanted to meet up for a quick bite, and suggested we should try \"Rock and vine\".    I ordered \"Braised Lamb Shank\".  It was delicious and had a great flavor.  Service was great, and owner greeted us with a perfect smile.  I recommend to anyone who's wanting a quality food and friendly service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this little gem while driving around on a Friday night. Loved it. Service was great and the food was so yummy for the right price! We're coming back."}
{"text":"Food average.  They never heard of Amstel Light beer.  Note that the 5 star review was from Detriot where the own owners are from. His only review ever! This could be a good place. Get draft beer which is necessary for your type of place.  I'm not sure what you are trying to be as a restaurant.  Second visit confirms the fact that the food is less than average.  The meat loaf was blah, my wife's ribs were not meaty with BBQ sauce that probably came from a bottle at Safeway.  The waiter did not know the specials and brought a beer that was not what I ordered.  Adding to the ambiance was a group near us with a small child that either cried or was allowed to run around the restaurant like it was in a track meet.  I don't understand why anyone would return here.  Also very small wine pours for the price"}
{"text":"our first time at rock and vine and it was phenomenal !! the food was a bit of a wait being the 6th week they opened .... the caprese salad better than most ... the calamari tender in a great sauce!!! burger and steak sandwhich a ten!!! 2 tens !!! gonna return !!!"}
