{"text":"Where to go when you're at First Markham Place with a certain someone who is picky and who only wants to eat Chinese food? Well, lucky for you, you haven't narrowed down your choices too much.   United Brothers Cafe is your typical HK style cafe.  I wasn't sure where to go, but of the many restaurants that were available, I was drawn to United Brothers Cafe by the sight of many patrons eating inside the restaurant... and the sign that said 10% off.  Yes, definitely that.  We had the beef tendon rice noodle soup for $3.95 and a wonton noodle soup for $4.50.    The prices were cheap and the noodles came in fairly large bowls.  The rice noodles were smooth and did not break into tiny pieces.  There were 5 wontons in the bowl of wonton noodle soup.   The beef tendon should have been cooked longer because it was still tough to chew and rubbery--not the way beef tendon should be.  The soup they used was the typical broth that many Chinese cafes tend to use for noodle soup; it was nothing special.  The tea tasted funny, so I asked for a glass of cold water instead.  The service was that of your typical Chinese restaurant.  Not sure what else to say. Nothing to see here."}
{"text":"Interior and staff is the same as the previous Kenny's, only kitchen staff changed.   Dinner: Baked Pork Chop Rice  I think it's slightly better than Kenny's. The tomato sauce was not too overpowering/heavy, however the pork chop was a bit tough and too salty. The vegetable soup was too spicy!! The hot horlick tasted like hot milk and the ovaltine was very diluted."}
{"text":"Was here the other night when I was hungry and looking for a place to eat late at night.  Conveniently at First Markham Place I decided to try this place out since it was one of the few places still with patrons inside after midnight.  United Brothers Cafe is about the strangest name I've seen for a local Chinese restaurant so far.    The first thing I noticed when I opened up the menu was the huge selection of items available (over 1000 different items!).  That's quite a selection even for a chinese restaurant.   I ordered hot and sour soup noodles and gai lan vegetables with garlic.  However, they had messed up the order and instead of the hot and sour soup noodles, it arrived without the noodles.  Not a big deal since I wasn't feeling particularly hungry and would have had left over noodles anyway.  I made sure to tell the waiter that they had made a mistake and not to charge me more than the original order (since the bowl was huge I was afraid it would actually be more expensive).  Luckily it wasn't a problem, and the waiter actually understood english to my surprise and said it actually costs less.    Quality of the food I ordered was very good.  The vegetables were pretty standard, but the hot and sour soup I would say is among the best i've had in a while.  Great taste, just the right spice, huge portion, and well prepared.  As i was leaving, I noticed one of the waiters never smiles and always has a sad look on her face.  I guess somebody isn't happy with their job."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster.  Previously known as Kenny's Delight, a decent place to grab a quick HK style lunch at a decent price.  No more.  While the menu and staff remain relatively unchanged, it appears management changed and tossed out any existing procedures or processes along the way.  Coworkers who had arrived before me at a different table received their food at seemingly random times throughout the lunch hour. While some had not even received theirs until others were finished... and immediately asked for a takeout box after waiting for over an hour.  My experience was no better.  The wait staff apparently forgot the basics of numbering tables and pairing the orders to that number.  I constantly found them walking from table to table asking \"Is this the food you ordered?\", \"Is this the food you ordered?\"   Suffice it to say, the food was rather pleasant, however I shall never return. Ever."}
{"text":"Overnight... Kenny's Delight becomes United Brothers Cafe...  Everything stayed the same.... aside from the signs, the menu and the wait staffs.  I would not have know I am in a different restaurant anyway... the menu is really similar with the usual stables.. but the selections is not as diverse. Maybe it is good thing...  10% off Grand Opening Special really brought in the crowds... The staffs seems to be overwhelmed and it took a good 20 minutes for the time I sat down till I have my food delivered to my table... Not good if you are in a rush...  Lunch menu has no soup noodles so I ended up ordering:  Four Treasure (Wonton, Dumplings, Fish Balls, Beef Balls) Noodles - $ 5.25 - Standard tasting but does have 2 wontons and dumplings each.... - No drinks comes with it....   Afternoon Tea starts from 2:30 pm to 6 pm... by the time my food arrived it is 2.27 pm already... maybe I should just wait and take advantage of that...at least I would have get a drink with my food!  I miss Kenny's Delight!"}
