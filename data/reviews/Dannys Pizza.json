{"text":"Have been coming here for decades... Always good.. Had an Italian Hoagie and a slice... Hot fresh and delicious... A must for locals and visitors.."}
{"text":"Well didn't plan on spending 50.00 on hoagies tonight....the prices on the website are apparently wrong...when I questioned the man behind the counter about the prices he said, \"they were 9 or 10 years old\"  Go down the street to Pasta Too it will be cheaper!!!"}
{"text":"My Pittsburgh friends told me I could not leave town without trying the world's best hoagie, out in the 'burbs, at Danny's. The raves went on, even after proclaiming my Philly roots where I grew up on hoagies, and have an expert badge on the topic.  So, off we went!  Danny's is a road-side dive with bare-bright fluorescent tubes in the ceiling.  We found most of its business was take-away, for good reason since the few booths inside are anything but inviting.  It turns out that this fab Pittsburgh \"hoagie\" is not really a hoagie at all.  It's a GRINDER!  By definition, a grinder is a hoagie that's been baked in the oven.  This one is served wrapped in aluminum foil.  I admit, it was a good grinder.  It's not a hoagie, unless perhaps you're from Pittsburgh or this part of it, anyway."}
{"text":"Went in here because it looked good from the outside & hardly anyone on the inside. 4 staff hardly doing anything & they did not start my order until I waited 20 min & then started it only after I asked about it. Otherwise, I would have been forgotten! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Great hoagies with good service. Stopped in on a busy Sat lunch, waited on almost immediately. Enjoyable meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was one of those people who moved away from Pittsburgh, but always put a visit to Danny's for a whole Italian hoagie (with onions) at the top of my itinerary on return trips to see the family.  Now that we're back in the area with our own family, Danny's is a special treat when nobody feels like cooking.  The hoagies are sublime -- the Platonic ideal of what an Italian hogie should be.  If you haven't had one, you're missing out on one of life's simple, essential pleasures."}
{"text":"The Steak Hoagie and Italian Hoagie are two of the best concoctions of bread, cheese, and meet that I have ever had!  The sauce is tangy, sweet, and savory.  The bread is crisp and toasty.  The meat is generous and tender.  Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water.  I have been coming here for years and make it a habit to get a hoagie or two every time I visit relatives in the region!  Definitely worth checking out!  Any place that has been open 50 years has to be doing something right!"}
{"text":"They have been making excellent hoagies and pizzas for decades. This place is beyond delicious and their service is always tip top. Do your self a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"Went to purchase a gift card to find out that the staff there didn't know how to load the card? What establishment does that, promotes \"Give someone a gift card\" by the register and no one knows how it works???? You've just lost a customer!"}
{"text":"I would like to apologize in advance. I have not been to Danny's for over 25 years. I don't live there anymore and am giving it 5 stars because of my memories of the place. Between delivering the Pittsburgh Press ,when it cost 67 cents a week, and my stint in the Navy, Danny's was my place of employment. I can't remember how long I worked there. Here is how I remember it: (engage dream sequence here........)  I made hoagies at Danny's. It was a while back. I was 16, I'm knocking on 60 now. The pizzas were made by the full time employees who were all old Italian men. Quite elderly, I am guessing in their 40s . Evidently, they were old family friends of Danny, the owner, who was probably about 30 or 40.  The hoagies were made by the high-school boys; never saw any girls working there. Pay was $1 per hour during the first week, while you were in \"training\". The second week, pay went up to $1.25, and stayed there, forever. You had to punch out at the time clock  for your daily 15 minute break. You got a free pop for your break. NO food.  Saturday was prep day, the day for making a weeks worth of hoagies. Danny's mother worked that day with two selected boys. It was not  perceived as an honor and we were not permitted to speak during the operation.  The construction sequence was: 3 of number 1;    2 of number 2; 3 of number 3; 2 of number 4. Allow me to explain. That is 4 different meats, how many slices of each, and the order they were applied to the just sliced hoagie bun. The bun was rejoined with its other half, installed in a plastic sleeve, twist tied and immediately frozen, to be extracted on a daily basis for the expected demand.  The hoagies were cooked after they were ordered. We opened the bag, opened the roll, squirted some oil/seasoning on the bun, slide them into the oven. They were done when the edges started to blacken. The only option was indicated on the order ticket  \"no number meant  no onions\", or  \"with a  number 9, slap on the onions\".  When things got slow, they sent us out in the parking lot , where everyone ate in their car, to pick up trash. The acceptable and expected way to discard your pizza box, papers, cups, ice and everything else you wanted to get rid of was to simply open your car window and push the mountain of trash through to the ground for us ciggy smoking, pimply teen boys to pick up. No one was expected to get out of their car to place their stuff in a trash can, and no one ever did. After the lot was \"redd up\" (Pittsburgh English) , we  returned to the establishment to construct more hoagies.  At the end of the night, if there was left over pizza, you could take some home. At first, my family would gobble it up. It was quite good. After a few weeks, though, everyone quit eating it.   I always smelled like onions in high school.  There was an old pizza maker there; I think his name was Frank. He had a lisp and it was torture for him to call out  the order numbers to the customers when their food was ready. We used to laugh ourselves silly when he had to call out \"sixes\".  He had number \"666\" one time; we almost had teenage coronaries on that one. He made good pizzas, worked hard and we were a bunch of non sympathetic, unfeeling teenagers. Sorry, Frank."}
{"text":"A bit of a disappointment coming to Danny's.  The service from the staff was rather cold and dry. No smiles or friendly banter during ordering (no line so it wasn't slammed), I sat outside in plain view of the window and they didn't even poke their head out to let me know my pizza was ready.  The pizza is ho-hum, it reminds me of a frozen, rising crust pizza. Not terrible, but not what I'd hope for with a pizza joint.  Outside seating is a tad loud with the traffic, but the fresh air and green grass more than make up for that, giving you a great spot to sit and munch on your food.  Cool spot, sad service and pizza."}
{"text":"Been to Danny's many times over the last 25 or so years. Ordered a small pizza , steak hoagie and chicken tenders. The steak hoagie was great as always. But the pizza has went downhill . The crust was hard the sauce non existant and cheese tasteless. The chicken tenders were overcooked and hard to chew. They really need to get back to the great food of years gone by."}
{"text":"Never been here in all my years of living in bethel until recently.  People think I'm crazy for that, I tell them who the hell cares.  Anyway, steak and cheddar hoagie was amazing, pizza just ok.  Wait was horrible, as was the service.  If you want a Bethel Park gem, go to Rice Inn or Casa Nayarit, not this place."}
{"text":"The best hoagie today and 30 years ago. The pizza is also tasty. The Italian and steak are my favorites."}
{"text":"Whenever i get the chance, i try to stop at Danny's Pizza! Both locations are great! The staff is always very kind and accommodating, especially with my severe allergies! They always prepare fantastic food in a comfortable environment! Whenever i go, I always get the Steak Hoagie. The ingredients are always fresh, and the food is always delicious!!"}
{"text":"In business since 1960...for good reason! I had the cheddar cheesesteak sub and it was amazing! Half was more than enough for a meal - bigger than a typical \"Subway- type\" of sandwich and much better. My friend had the standard Philly-style cheesesteak...also delicious. We waited about 20 minutes for our sandwiches (they get a ton of call-in orders so even though it may not look busy, be prepared to wait), but the sub was sooooo worth the delay. Definitely one of the best subs I've ever eaten. Good variety on the menu but not so many choices as to be overwhelming. Next time I'm trying the buffalo chicken hoagie - it also looked delicious!"}
{"text":"The best Italian hoagie on the planet!   My mom ate these when she was pregnant with me and my brothers. 30 years later, I moved back to Pittsburgh and found this place on accident. When telling my family, my mom told me she used to make my dad drive here for her cravings at night time!  Now I go here with my kids!"}
{"text":"We order takeout from here all of the time. We only tried their pizza once or twice (honestly nothing special). But, oh man, their vegetable hoagie is sooo yum. The bread is perfectly crunchy, vegetables crisp and fresh, and just the right amount of cheese. Counter staff have been pleasant every time I've stopped in."}
{"text":"What can I say about Danny's that could possibly do it justice?  My father has been going here since he was in high-school, and a trip to Steel Town isn't complete for me without a visit. The picture of Italian Hoagie perfection that this place paints is, quite simply put, the best on the planet.  It is breathtaking...it's like if Leo Da Vinci and Lidia Bastianich had a baby, and that baby created this sandwich in a stroke of weird chef/artist baby-genius.  I salivate like Pavlov's dog when I get within 50 miles of this place.  Always perfectly assembled, with even meat/cheese distribution and proper application of vegetables AFTER toasting, this hulking sandwich is a pleasure to eat even in your Sunday Finest!  Every bite is an explosion of flavor, but I rarely need a napkin.  Nothing should be added to or taken away from the \"Original Hoagie with everything.\"  It can not be improved upon.  Period.  If God ate hoagies, this would be the only one she cared for. And she wouldn't call ahead either...she'd know that they are best fresh out of the oven, and that the wait is never too long. You can never wait too long for a Danny's Italian hoagie. God says so.  And I say so.  And I told God about this place, so there.  The satisfaction I feel after eating a Danny's Italian Hoagie is not unlike what I feel after the best, most opulent holiday meal.  Only I can get that satisfaction any day I want by eating a Danny's Italian Hoagie...imagine that!  It's like crack, only better.  Food crack.  Or maybe food heroin, because once I eat one I want to take a nap!  Nod right out...     They also make pizza.  I've never had it."}
{"text":"On a rare Bachelor (no wife, no kids) weekend, I decided I wanted a good crusty Italian Hoagie.  Places super close by have been letting me down, so I searched Yelp, and Danny's was the answer.  I called ahead and ordered both an Italian Hoagie and small pepperoni pizza.  I decided to eat in house, and the hoagie was awesome.  Nice, Fresh, Hot, crusty baked Italian Hoagie served exactly as it should be!  The pizza was also very good, although there was some grease from the cheese, it was an excellent accompaniment to the hoagie.  I had a now-more-rare-than-usual Mt. Dew with  it and I was in heaven.  I sort of forgot about this place, but I've definitely been reminded that it's a solid reliable place in the South Hills for great food!"}
{"text":"Yep...Go for the hoagie.... Can't miss,.   Everyone loves em!!  Jessica P is right on.  However, you can pass on the pizza. It's alright but you can definitely find way better in pitt.   Aiella's or Mineo's in Squirrel Hill for example."}
{"text":"What they say about the hoagies at Danny's is true; there's something special about them. So when you come here, just stick to the hoagies. The bread on the hoagies is perfectly toasted and the ingredients are so fresh. I could eat a hoagie from here everyday.   On the other hand, the pizza we ordered was pretty awful. This is terrible, but it reminded me a little of cafeteria pizza. However, worst of all, the pizza dough was so thick that our crust was raw! I'm perfectly okay with thick crust pizza, but definitely not okay with gooey raw dough beneath my toppings. We had to put it pack into our oven to finish cooking, which kind of defeats the purpose of ordering out, right?  Danny's hoagies are the way to go. I don't recommend the pizza."}
{"text":"I'm new to Bethel and came here on a co workers referral.  I decided to go easy and ordered the famous Italian.  Waited patiently for 20 minutes and took it home as the place is very small with limited seating.  The ingredients seen to be good quality, although this thing comes with barely a skiff of meat.  For 13 bucks I got mostly toasted bread and shredded lettuce.  I used to live by Peppis Subs and these things can't compare.  I might go back and try the pizza sometime but the subs are a hard 'pass'."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! This was our first time here and we loved it!! We will definitely make this a regular stop"}
{"text":"Not as great as they used to be. Prices have definitely gone up. It was $50 for four of us to have lunch! Just for two half hoagies and small pizzas."}
{"text":"The perfect lunch for me is a Dannys steak hoagie and an order of their house fries with a large pepsi ......It doesn't get any better than that .....ONLY drawback is they don't deliver but theres a reason they have been here forever without delivering"}
{"text":"Great pizza, even better hoagies. This is THE place for Italian hoagies, everything else pales in comparison."}
{"text":"Two words- Italian hoagie. The best in the Burgh; it must be something about that secret \"pan coating\" in the oven. A south hills staple!"}
{"text":"Best hoagies I've ever had in my life period the Italian is amazing had the fries and onion rings which were very good as well do not live close but defiantly worth the drive out would recommend to anyone in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Gotta get an Italian Hoagie here every time I'm back in Pittsburgh.  Love their steak and cheese hoagie too."}
{"text":"Tried Danny's for hoagies last week. My husband tried the Italian, while I tried meatball.  The Italian was ok. The meatball was exactly what I was looking for. Homemade sauce on a thick crusty roll and tasty meatballs.  One week later, we tried the pizza. We have been on the hunt for a good pizza since we got here. We come from a state where mom and pop pizza shops are on every corner., and they are all good. Pizza is important to us. Danny's pizza is pretty good. The sauce is exactly what I like. The crust is good, but just a little too thick and chewy for us.  Do not order multiple toppings. Pick one or get a specialty pizza. We ordered 4 toppings on a large, not realizing we'd pay over 25 dollars for a pie. They don't skimp on topping, but that's still way too much for pizza.  All in all, for no frills take out, Danny's is pretty good."}
{"text":"Third time I've stopped to get a couple slices of cheese pizza. It took 20 minutes to heat up the slices, place had only 2 other guests so it really wasn't busy. One guy seemed to be the only one cooking the others stood around folding pizza boxes. Could have cooked an entire pizza at home for that time. Not returning!"}
{"text":"Went to Pittsburgh last weekend and went to Danny's! I stand by my previous praise! YUMMMMMMMM!!!  PS (I'm pretty sure AT LEAST half of the passengers on the plane ended up stopping by as well...) hahahahaha"}
{"text":"Best pizza and hoagies around!! Don't deliver but it's still worth driving there to pick it up. They deffinately don't skimp out on toppings! Little pricey but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Italian and steak hoagies.   Too bad they apparently are closed for lunch now.  Called today to order and they said they don't open until 4."}
{"text":"I've been driving past Dannys for over a year now, always going just a few steps away to the Aldi next door. Finally, I made the journey just to get Dannys and was very pleased! I split a Philly Cheesesteak Calzone & Curly Fries with my boyfriend, both of which were made to order and super tasty. The wait time wasn't too bad (~15 min) considering they had to fill & bake the calzone. The calzone was huge and fresh, lasting us 2-3 meals - definitely worth the $12. The curly fries we also awesome, and the service was very friendly and prompt. Will be back to try more of their hoagies & pizza!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch one busy weekend afternoon hoping to satisfy my craving for tangy red sauce and melty cheese. The inside is smaller than you would think. The kitchen is open and takes up about half the restaurant. There are a few (5ish) tables by the windows. No rocket science here. Make your selection from the menu board, order at the counter and wait. I chose to go with 2 New York style slices and  a steak hoagie. The slices were $2.15 without toppings. They also have square slices for less available in the late afternoon/evening. I waited for about 15 minutes and took my food to go. The pizza was crispy on the bottom and melty on the top. They add the cheese before warming it up in the oven so no old, sloppy cheese here. The slices were a good size. I also liked that they cut them in half to make it easier to eat. Hubs ate the steak hoagie. He liked it but was nowhere near blown away. Overall, I was a little disappointed in the prices (a tiny bit high for the quality) and the wait times."}
{"text":"Not the biggest, brightest or cleanest star in the game - but the original Italian is what a hoagie is supposed to be. Ordering is cafeteria style and the menu isn't fancy. The sandwich is served on paper when it comes out of the oven.   I have to stop in and visit at least once when I am back in town and I always get the original Italian. Yum!"}
{"text":"One of the best hoagie places around, steak with everything on it and their famous red sauce is a must. I also had onion rings when I last visited and they where also delicious. 5 stars in my book and I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Danny's Italian Hoagies are the best! I've had them on/off for over 35yrs. They taste EXACTLY the same as they did 35+ years ago! Even though I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, whenever I am visiting family, I will call ahead for a take out order and take it all the way back to Maryland!"}
{"text":"This use to be the place to go for good pizza and great hoagies. However lately they've been horrible. I keep giving them chances because it's a local shop, but they continue to disappoint. Today was especially bad. I ordered a hoagie and wings and both were the worst I've ever seen. I couldn't eat anything yet alone feed my children this mess, so I called and offered them the opportunity to fix the situation and instead of an apology I got a \"golly gee I'll let the cooks know.\""}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST Italian hoagie place around!!! Everything is perfect--good meats, cheese, fresh vegetables and that crispy, fresh bun! Add a hot basket of those crinkle cut French fries and we are in Hoagie Heaven! The shop is nostalgic although they did a nice remodel inside. The employees are awesome--they have a flawless system that shows great teamwork. These employees work hard to give us what we want--the best, freshest hoagies in a nice, clean and friendly shop. EXCELLENT JOB!!! We will be back again and again and......."}
{"text":"This was the best cheat meal. Went in on Memorial Day when they weren't super busy, the staff was really friendly, we ordered two hoagies and they were so freaking good. Everything was seasoned so well and full of flavor and their bread was so good. The half is huge, I had a hard time finishing it, but it was delicious. Well worth it."}
{"text":"The original italian hoagie is the best I've ever tasted, and I've been trying to find another even close to it since I moved away from Pittsburgh decades ago- no luck! Little did I know then how precious a place Danny's is! The hoagy has a special (secret!)  italian-type dressing that combines just the right amount of moisture with cheese, pepperonis, some kind of ham, salami- but not too much meat to overwhelm the sandwich. Then it is cooked in the pizza oven which I think gives it the perfect toasted texture that adds to its fame. Lettuce, tomatoes and onions are added after the hoagy is cooked. This is an incredible sandwich and like the other poster said, it is addicting like heroin must be LOL. Whenever I visit Pittsburgh I MUST-HAVE-DANNYS-HOAGY and I have gone to the extent of getting one regardless of whether all the meals in my itinerary are planned."}
{"text":"Old time pizza shop with other great menu items. The inside is in need of some up keep. Ordered the whole Original Italian Hoagie. Great Hoagie. Big enough to only eat a half for lunch and take the rest home. It was great! Tons of meat and toppings and great bread.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Solid Italian hoagie.  I would recommend asking for light onion if you aren't a fan.  A half will definitely feed two people.  Really fast pick-up times even on what appeared to be a pretty busy night.  Hidden gem would be the pizza bagels!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little boxcar-looking place that makes pretty good pizzas and hoagies. There's really not much to say about it other than that. I recommend it for people who like this kind of food.   Darren's making me like pizza more and more. :) I used to hardly ever eat it unless my dad makes it (his is still the best imo), but look at how much pizza I eat now! lol"}
{"text":"Yes.  Steak hoagie, money. Red sauce with tang, lots of meat and perfectly crispy bun with provolone.  Italian hoagie, money. Oil and spices in the bread, a few meats, awesome.  I grew up close to here and any time I'm home I manage to get over to Danny's for half a steak and half an Italian. Can't beat 'em.  Pizza? Not bad. -- Go for the hoagies."}
{"text":"We were directed to Danny's Pizza by a friend that has been going here for over 40 years.  We opted for carry out, as the place was packed that Friday. Although packed, our food was made and ready to go in about 20 minutes....it smells so good in there that my mouth was watering!  We had a small calzone and a small pizza with pepperoni.   I must say, the calzone was excellent, and the pizza was one of the best that I have had in a very long time.  When we're back to visit family again, this is going to be a must have for us!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Italian hoagie and Super Slice in all of PA, maybe the planet. But I haven't been to the Galapagos Islands yet."}
{"text":"Best hoagies (Famous Italian) you can get in the South Hills.  But let me put a disclaimer in for the curious:  this place is not fancy, they actually make their food versus Microwave (think Applebees), and its very affordable.  If you are ok with that, you'll love it.  One last thing: try their unbaked subs to take home for parties or later.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Danny's has, by far, my most favorite Italian hoagie in the universe. While I was living away from Pittsburgh, I would always have to stop by (at least once) every time I came home. However, I must go after 4pm, so I can also get my square slices.  Nice to see that the renovated the interior, as well.  Love Danny's!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try, within a 3 month period. The last time the tables were filthy, service was mediocre, the wait was longer than it should have been, & the slices I got were mediocre.  This time the tables were clean & the service was good. The wait was still long & this time, because after 4pm they force you to have Sicilian slices, they were terrible. The green peppers were big chunks, just laying on top & falling off when you picked it up. The crust was gross. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I 've eaten at Danny's several times now. It's a great little place to grab a pizza or sub. The staff is very polite and create a welcoming atmosphere. The interior gives a diner type feel with window booths.   My husband LOVES the Italian Hoagie and I enjoy the veggie hoagie. Portions are large. We have also shared pizza which was flavorful, filling and more than enough for 2 people with leftovers to take home. Because the food is made fresh to order, you do have to wait while they make it but it is always fresh from the oven and worth the short wait. This is a great place to order take out. Prices are reasonable and worth the product. They have many side options as well which I have not tried but would like to in the future.   My biggest complaint is that there are no public restrooms!"}
{"text":"Came for a small pizza (takeout) and was greeted by the nicest people ever. The pizza was good, extremely cheesy and stayed hot until I got home. I def want to come back and try the hoagies as that is what they are famous for!"}
{"text":"So.  I went to Danny's for the first time in years to this location because I just moved back to the area and remembered how good it was. We ordered a steak hoagie French fries and slices of pizza. The food took a bit of time to cook but that is expected with good food. When it came out they handed us a box for the pizza and a big bag with some boxes in it telling us that all of the food was in there and that we were good to go. We get halfway home and realize the steak hoagies are not in the bag. No biggie.. I live right down the street I'll just turn around and grab them. I go in to let them know I did not get the steaks I paid for and I get told that they are certain that they have them to us. I explain to the employees that I did not have them. The guy at the counter then proceeds to tell the other employee to go and check my car to make sure that the hoagie was not in there before they made me another one. I laughed thinking it was a joke. They actually came out and went into my car. After all of this they did not give me my money back they hurried up and threw another one together and gave me it without a real apology. My fries were then cold and so was my pizza. I spent fifty bucks on nothing."}
{"text":"The quality and taste of the pizza and hoagie my wife and I enjoyed were excellent.  I have a bitter taste in my mouth, though, over management which is unprincipled.  There are two categories of pizza toppings: regular and premium.  Regular toppings are $2.30 on a \"Grande\" pizza, premium toppings are $3.30.  I chose a topping listed under the regular column, meatballs, and was charged for a premium item.  I called it to the attention of the clerk, who told me that meatballs had been listed in the wrong category on the board and that the $3.30 charge was correct.  Did he offer to refund the dollar?  No, all he did was to offer to change the order.  I declined.  It will be a long time before I return, it ever.  I dislike dishonesty."}
{"text":"A cornerstone of Bethel is good, but is it worth it? I say yes, but many comment on how expensive Danny's is.  Of course when you compare their subs to Subway they do seem expensive...but that's where the comparison ends. Danny's bread is so good it makes the sandwich. It's a hopping place that is always busy. My advice call ahead, take it out, stop and get some beer or pop at a Giant Eagle and enjoy some of the best subs and calzones in the South Hills."}
{"text":"Sometimes I want a dinner that busts down barriers, spins convention into dizziness, gives me glimpses into foreign cultures, and flings me into the future.  Other times, I just want a pizza and a hoagie.   Established in 1960, Danny's Pizza has been serving up the standards without shame or an ounce of care for the latest trends. The building is as narrow as a diner car, but the food is a double-wide trailer full of Italian/American quick-serve classics straight from the blackened griddle, the deep-fryer, and the oven. Men in white shirts with accents scurry about merrily behind the counter carrying steaming, ballooned calzones around on wooden paddles, flipping sizzling steak flaps about with steel spatulas, and plunging baskets of food into deep-fryers. On an unseasonably humid, hazy, and drizzly December night, Kay and I ventured deep into the south of Pittsburgh for solace of a cheesy and doughy nature.  I had takeout from the no-dine-in Danny's in Baldwin two summers ago, and my experience at this Bethel Park location was similar albeit fresher. The crust of the pizza was akin to a savory danish. Its sauce, while bashfully applied, was bold in flavor. The cheese was laid on more thickly than a salesman's pitch and oozed and slithered in a manner that made it seem animate. The subtle black olives (topping #1) were shouted down by fatty, burly bacon bits (topping #2. they don't offer pineapple in case you are a regular reader and sense that something is amiss) that tasted of real pork, not stale, petrified jerky that dwells in glass shakers or cheap salad bars.   Supposedly, Danny's is famed for their hoagies, and my singular fault about the grinder I had 24 hours ago at this restaurant was that there could and should have been even more delicatessen meat between that baked, oily bun and amidst the ripe, garden-picked vegetables, molten provolone, and vinegary dressing. Protein-pinching aside, Danny's basic hoagies deserve their acclaim.   There's a sense of clarity to Danny's that approaches zen. With the avant-garde and alien overtaking so much of urban Pittsburgh, eateries such as these found in suburban Pittsburgh disentangle the mind and palate, replacing all of that novel, risky clamor with the familiar and dependable, reminding us that there'd be none of this...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF2uSHEya6Y  ...without that...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7fRMSjomo"}
{"text":"Salvation! and why am I drooling?  That Danny's Italian Hoagie I had for lunch is so divine.  There are imitators but none compare!  The hoagie is toasted and has an italian type dressing that gives it some mouth watering flavor.  They have other hoagies that are OK and the pizza (forgetaboutit). Just go for the Italian Hoagie.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza. After 4 pm you get the square cut if you order by the slice. Crust was light and crisp and the sauce was excellent. Not sweet but flavorful and a hint of acid...yummy!! I shall be back."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so-so, and the calzone was pretty terrible, but I returned here because a friend convinced me that I really had to try the hoagies. Before I get to the sandwiches, I came in with an order for two sandwiches, and coupon for $2 off. The manager had given me this coupon for days beforehand, buy they wouldn't honor it this night. They didn't even tell me that they weren't going to, I added it up in my head and questioned them. They said \"It's too hard to do in the system.\"  I don't know which I'm more upset about, that they wouldn't honor the  four day old coupon, or that they tried to hoodwink me about it. Either way, I'm not coming back to this place.   As for the sandwiches, they were pretty good. The meatball was a little spicy, and might have benefitted from more cheese. The Philly steak was a little plain, and might have benefitted from more spice, but both were defitely worth eating, just not worth a return trip in the context of dishonest counter staff. If you come here, skip the pizza, order the sandwich, and watch your back!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been back to Pittsburgh in a decade and when asked where did I want to eat...? Danny's in Bethel Park!  Please tell me my HS haunt, from over 30 years ago, still stands. It had been remodeled and I feared the food might have been too.  Gratefully, the sacred Famous Italian Hoagie was still intact!  Smart since there was no reason to alter perfection.  Honestly, this classic hoagie is nirvana and I only wish I could transplant them to Southern California.  Additionally, the vibe of the staff is awesome.  Never disappointed.  Pittsburgh has so many jewels and this is assuredly one of their diamonds!"}
{"text":"First off I want to say, I DID NOT TRY A HOAGIE. They looked fabulous and in hindsight, I should have ordered one. However, I did not see them until after I had already ordered a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was terrible, one from the freezer at a grocery store would have been better, especially for the price. It had tons of grease and was overly soggy. As for atmosphere, I appreciate a good hole-in-the-wall establishment but, cheap paper plates?  If you're going to go, try one of the hoagies and avoid the pizza altogether. Just because a restaurant isn't a chain and is an old building, it doesn't make it a \"hidden gem\"."}
{"text":"Years ago Danny's was my favorite place to get pizza. It used to be set up as a grab and go. Now they offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Their menu has expanded to include full size pizzas, calzones, hoagies, and even appetizers. Take out is still available. If you are planning to pay with a credit card please note that anything under $10.00 is subject to $1.00 transaction fee. Anything over is your actual spend.  Remembering they have over sized hoagies I was happy to learn that you could still buy pizza by the slice. Toppings are $.45 extra per choice and some are what they consider premier toppings.  Soft drinks are for sale as well. If you want ice tea you can get it as sweetened, raspberry, or unsweetened. Sorry they have no sugar or sugar substitutes if you want to get it unsweetened. Refills available for a minimal charge.  I order one NY style slice of mushroom and green pepper pizza. They do make their pizzas from scratch and got a small soft drink for just over $5.00. I was told wait time would be 10 minutes and sure enough it was ready as was told me.  A small portion of the bottom crust was burnt but not that bad that would make me want to give it back to them. For one slice this piece was what I would say the size of 2! It was okay. Not as good as I remembered them but still very filling for me.  Last time I was here was a few years back where I had half a hoagie. Bread is very thick and again would recommend only get half if you are not planning to take it home with you.  Danny's shares the entrance to Aldi's grocery store so it can be a bit tricky to get in and out with those customers coming in.Still I had no trouble and was a great chance to revisit memory lane again."}
