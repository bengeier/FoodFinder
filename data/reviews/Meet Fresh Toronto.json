{"text":"good food! Good service (even though there is line up, but the line is moving quite fast, and they kept apologize to everyone since they felt sorry for the long waiting time, really appreciated!) Ordered meet fresh signature, with a free Qmochi set~ yumyum!
I have tried meet fresh in China, exactly the same taste!
Definitely gonna come back~"}
{"text":"Waited for 35 minutes from order to pick up in the store. The taste is average but had a really bad stomachache after having their red bean ice."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place since I heard great things about their grass jelly which I love a lot. 

The first time we were here, the cashier didn't really speak English. I wanted to order a hot grass jelly and she told me it was \"burning\". I wasn't sure what she meant so we went for the cold instead. We ordered a Meet Fresh signature and a #4. We were given a beeper and was told to go upstairs. We waited around 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Would've expected it to come quicker as everything is pretty much premade.

The grass jelly was very smooth and not too hard. I was quite surprised that there was ice on the bottom of the grass jelly. I would've preferred it if there was less ice or none at all as it made the grass jelly very watery. The sweet potato/taro balls are basically a chewy glutinous rice ball with pretty much no flavour. Not a fan of them. 

The second time we decided to give the hot grass jelly a try. We ordered a #4 grass jelly again but substituted tapioca and taro/sweet potato balls with mung beans and peanuts. We also tried the tofu pudding in almond soup.

I finally know why the cashier told us the hot grass jelly would be \"burning\". Rather than firm grass jelly, when you order it hot, it is almost completely liquid. To better describe it, the grass jelly was all melted. After a while it became more slimy. If they offer hot grass jelly, they should make a firmer variation suitable of serving it hot. They used the same grass jelly as the cold one. From my pictures, you can clearly see all the toppings have sunk as it wasn't firm enough to hold up the toppings.

The tofu pudding in almond soup wasn't bad, but the tofu pudding wasn't smooth enough. It was also a little too firm for my liking. I liked the almond soup. On its own it's pretty sweet, but since the tofu pudding was pretty much unsweetened, the combination was great."}
{"text":"I went to meetfresh the first time because i like Taiwanese desserts i tried in Taipei and at meetfresh Toronto you definitely can have a chance to discover those particular and different tastes that are rare to find here. In my opinion some items are really well made and surprisingly good like the Brown sugar mochi ball (peanuts/sesame) the egg pudding and the Mung bean cake that is simply exquisite. The selection of drinks is pretty intresting in terms of something new to try. I'm not use to the taste that has the tofu pudding and the purple rice porridge i decided to try so it wasn't a big surprise but i do have to admit that other items like the red bean shaved ice and the herbal jelly (expecially mixed with the condensed milk) left me pretty satisfied and with the willing to try something else the next time."}
{"text":"They might have misspelled their brand, because it should say \"Meet Meh...\" My friends and I popped by to taste their menu for an after-dinner dessert. 
We ordered several items, including the Milk Tea w/ Grass Jelly, Meet Fresh Signature and Red Bean soup. 

Toronto, being already over-saturated with Taiwanese desert houses, could do without this amateur establishment. The milk tea tastes like water, something my high school self would make messing around in the kitchen. The dessert was average, offering nothing unique to the experience. While this review may appear critical, the prices are exhorbant in comparison to the end product you receive ($7 for a drink and $10 for a dessert) 

However the d√©cor of the restaurant is quite captivating with a modern take to an open kitchen and seating area. Overall, would I come back? Perhaps, but they need to amp up their food quality game to match their high price point.

One major highlight however was the stellar service of the staff. They were very friendly, welcoming and go the extra mile to make sure that you are comfortable during your stay."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan of this dessert place! It is a little bit pricey, for what the dessert is but it's worth it! Its original Chinese dessert, so expect a lot of beans, a lot of soup, a lot of Taro balls, tofu, and some herbal jelly. I honestly love the Taro balls, tapioca, and the fresh fresh herbal jelly here. They have a various combination of bowls do the different items mentioned above. The bubble tea is okay here, not the best, but it's not bad if you want to get it all at one place. They have a system where you order downstairs and you then pick up your food upstairs where it gets delivered in a elevator system. They recently added a new menu with their almond series."}
{"text":"Really good taro and sweet potato balls and much better than what you can get at places like green grotto for comparison. Not great enough to just come back for. Menu was not explained nor displayed well as the cold version is with ice and syrup while the hot version of the taro balls is in a red bean soup which was a surprise when we received our order. Gave it a four star as I think it would taste better if I wasn't so full to begin with.

Also, they only had the small taro/potato balls available."}
{"text":"Another dessert place to choose from. So what makes this place so special? Red bean soup with rice balls or taro balls. This is not something I can regularly find so I feel like it's worth a try. I ordered the fresh milk tea with grass jelly and it was alright. Nothing special  The service was alright but the place is really nice and bright. Good enough to satisfied craving for Asian desserts."}
{"text":"Came here to try out the newly opened Meet Fresh, specialized in desserts featuring a herb called Grass Jelly.  This is a popular dessert in China and Taiwan. 

The dessert can be served either hot or cold, and usually served with additional toppings such as tapioca's, taro balls, red bean, etc.

We ordered a signature Grass Jelly (hot), and an additional signature Grass Jelly in chilled format for take out.

The venue :  3.5/5

The shop is setup in a 2 floors format,  whereas first floor is the ordering area, and the dining  area is upstairs. 

The upstair dining room has ample room with 10 tables, however when we arrive there were several open tables but they were all dirty and needed to be cleared and cleaned.  Fortunately we didn't have to wait long for our table to be cleared.

Grass Jelly (Hot) 4/5

The grass jelly in hot format was really tasty,  it has good texture and it really help to warm up the belly during the cold winter. It wasnt too sweet and the toppings were also well cooked  as well 

Would definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"I had this and Taiwan and was so happy they opened here! This is the best taro balls I have found outside of Taiwan! They have a good flavour and perfect texture. Other places on Yonge have been disappointing. Got the taro balls with sweet potato, barley and tapioca it was great. My wife got the herbal jelly signature and felt there wasn't enough toppings. Very good service and great quality."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of any type of chewy foods like mochis, tapiocas, taro balls etc. so i was super excited to try this restaurant.

This place is bright and clean, it's a pay first and self-serve type of restaurant. There are a few seats on the first floor with more seating upstairs.

I came around 10pm and there was a short line up. Overall the wait was pretty quick- around 5 to 10 mins. The menu has alot of options and we decided to go with one of the top 10s - Meet fresh signature for take out.

The bowl includes shaved ice, grass jelly with taro balls and it's $8.7 + tax. I find it a bit pricey for the size, however it tastes pretty good. I would say it tastes better than its direct competitors in Toronto.

If I ever crave for taro balls or grass jelly dessert i would certainly come back."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for some sweets and chat with friends! I ordered purple rice congee with Taro ball. Unfortunately it run out of regular size taro ball has to replace with small balls. It was really tasty.
Price is on the high range for sweets I think but it come with large bowl of congee! It was really filling. 
Maybe the owner might want to consider to add different level of quantity and price.

Second Floor view of young street was a nice touch! However chairs with no back support does say \"be comfortable and relax\".

For that overall 4 star."}
{"text":"We went on an early evening on Saturday and there was a line with 3 or 4 people in it. It seemed like it wasn't too busy. I ordered the hot Meet Fresh signature, the purple rice porridge with mini taro and sweet potato balls (they ran out of the regular sized balls), and the deluxe egg pudding. You also have the option of choosing rice balls with the purple rice porridge. I was asked if I wanted to dine-in or take out, I said dine-in and was given a beeper and receipt. I waited on the chairs with the side tables near the cashier (I thought this was the only area of the place).

After waiting for 30 minutes for my order, I was wondering why it took so long since there wasn't that many people. It was then when I realized that there was a second floor with tables and that if given a beeper to wait, you had to dine-in on the second floor. The staff member told me that the first floor is only for take-out and basically can't eat on this floor. I went upstairs and saw that the second floor was packed. I waited another 15 minutes for my food to arrive. In total, it took 45 minutes for my food even though the food is mostly already prepared.

Despite the 45 minute wait, I really enjoyed the food. The bowls were quite large and is perfect for sharing among 2-3 people. I wouldn't recommend coming here with the mentality of having dessert after a full dinner. I came here before dinner so I was ready to eat, but after eating the bowl for awhile, it got to the point where it was too much. It will be too much to eat if you eat the entire bowl yourself. The sweetness of the purple rice porridge was surprisingly not overly sweet. I expected it to be really sweet but it wasn't and I enjoyed the sweetness level. Even though the taro and sweet potato balls were the mini ones, they were the perfect chewiness, as was the tapioca. The deluxe egg pudding was one of my favourites as I am a tapioca and egg pudding lover. Meet Fresh killed it with this one! For all those tapioca and egg pudding lovers, you have to try this! Of the three items, the deluxe egg pudding was the sweetest because of the syrup they put on the egg pudding and the purple rice porridge was the least sweet.

The food selection was very extensive and the amount of ingredients put into each item was pretty generous. The staff were very friendly and had good customer service. I really enjoyed the three items I tried. Wait time wise, it could be quicker as 45 minutes for desserts is not okay in my books. Also, it would be nice if the customers are told about the second floor and that the first floor is only for take-out upon ordering. If it wasn't for the long wait and not being told about only dining in on the second floor, I would've given them 5 stars. This is definitely the place to go if you're craving some Taiwanese desserts."}
{"text":"Got both the Signature Herbal Jelly & Do-Hwa with Taro. I was amazed especially with the mochi bals, but wife was not as impressed - so with go with her opinion. Given they're usually busy, they do need to step up their service/process."}
{"text":"Meet fresh cold signature is so heavenly! I am now addicted to this place. Highly recommended to people who are searching for good shaved ice and grass jelly!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and decided to try some of desserts here. Luckily the line was not that long when I ordered but the line grew quickly afterwards. 

The staff were friendly and I didn't have to wait too long for my order, roughly five minutes.The interior is very bright, clean and modern with a spacious seating area on the second floor. 

I tried the Meet Fresh Signature and it came in a decent sized portion. I liked that it was not too sweet and can customize the amount of cream you want to add to the dessert by pouring it yourself. It was very refreshing to eat. I also tried the Q Mochi Shaved Ice and I believe this dessert is perfect for sharing given its generous portion size. I would come back next time to try their taro balls."}
{"text":"Really love this place ! Has delicious and refreshing Mochi! 

We got the 2 flavours brown sugar sesame and the peanut. It left us feeling really refreshed and with a mint after tatse we felt. The dessert was not overly sweet either, atleast made us feel healthier haha.

The bowl we had was Grass jelly, barly, Brown sugar ice, and tapioca which was also a lighter fare and taste. Not overly sweet, felt really refreshing and good after eating!


I would reccomend as a go to place for everyday snack or dessert ! 

Service and cleanliness also 5 stars. ! They are fast, friendly and efficient !

Excited for my next visit :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I got one of the herbal jelly bowls and it was really really good!! It even came with shaved ice underneath the jelly.  Personally, I think it was better than Zen Q but the portions were slightly smaller. It was $8.70."}
{"text":"This is the third time they give us the wrong food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!we order the No4 with additional taro ball!!!!!!!but can you guys see any taro balls in my order???? If this is the first or second time I can totally understand maybe they were busy?or something!!!!!!!!!! But three time they were still making the same mistake!!!!!! Hope they can have some well trained stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A trip down memory lane. Meetfresh is a new addition to the \"taiwan\" scene in Toronto joining on the list of Taiwanese establishments such as coco and chatime (missing 50 lan bbt!). 

Meetfresh serves bowls of delicious  goodness that can be found throughout the streets of taiwan (popular in the summer) and it's a bowl of shaved ice with grass jelly and various other toppings. After waiting for God knows how long, I had the opportunity to try it and it's the real deal. Many other dessert places in Toronto serve up similar shaved ice and herbal jelly bowls but if you want a taste of taiwan, you gotta come here. Their signature taro ball dishes is my recommendation with it being \"mochi\" but mixed with ice, herbal jelly and other toppings, it's as good as it gets. Meetfresh has stores around Asia outside of taiwan and if you ask anyone in Taiwan where to get a local treat, they'll recommend you meetfresh."}
{"text":"Initially, we noticed Meet Fresh renovating and were looking forward to trying it as soon as they opened.  So we finally decided to give the place a try tonight and were rather disappointed with what we got.  

We got Taro Balls No. 1 and Taro Balls No. 5, and honestly speaking, they were pretty much the same (looked the same, tasted the same, etc).  In our containers, we got around 5 or 6 taro and yam balls, beans, 5 or 6 rice balls (they replaced tapioca with rice balls because they were out of tapioca), all of which were swimming in a container of watery red bean soup.  It's a bit ironic to say that there was more red bean soup than Taro Balls when the name of the option is called Taro Balls No. 1 and Taro Balls No. 5.  Perhaps this calls for a name change?

The unfortunate thing is that they were both priced at $8.70 each...both of which were way overpriced for the amount of toppings we got in our containers.  The options we ordered are definitely not worth the price we paid. 

Word of advice: the end product looks nothing like their promotional photos and is rather deceiving.

All in all, this is not a place that we would revisit."}
{"text":"Meet Fresh is a Taiwanese dessert restaurant that has now expanded to Toronto!¬† I remember hearing about the news sometime last year when Sweven Media was working on bringing them here.

This past weekend (Jan 19, 20, and 21), Meet Fresh had their opening weekend.¬† In celebration of that, they had a \"Free Q Mochi Giveaway\" with this msg:  \"As appreciation for your patience and interest, we want to give you free Q Mochi!¬†¬†The first 300 customers to arrive on the opening weekend (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) will be given a Q Mochi set (8 pieces) for free on each day!¬† We open our doors at 11 am, so make sure to come early to get yours!\"

I received that promo e-mail in my inbox from Sweven Media.

My bf also alerted me to this giveaway because there was a Facebook event where the title of the event was \"300 Free Q Mochi Sets each day, Meet Fresh Soft Opening\".¬† 

So anyone reading these words would think that upon lining up at 11 am, the proposed Q Mochi Set would be free; right?¬† It only made sense that if you lined up that early in anticipation for their event that the mochi set would be free.¬† As a PR company or restaurant promoting itself, giving free items to campaign and hype themselves is a smart marketing idea.¬† When something is given for free, you have willing happy people who are going to line up for hours and provide free promotion for you.¬† It's win-win for both parties.

Thus, we arrived on Sunday, Jan 21 at exactly at 11 am where there was already a small line-up of about 10 to 15 people in line.¬† Once we queued ourselves up at the end of the line, the doors opened and everyone was able to go in.¬† 

There was a menu of the items above the cashier and the line seemed to move slowly.¬† We overheard someone in the front of the line say that apparently the mochi sets weren't free but that they were free with purchase.¬† What?!¬† I thought this was a free giveaway.¬† ...¬† We were fine to purchase an item and receive the free mochi set since we were already there, but I immediately felt deceived and¬†slighted by the campaign.

I knew the contact person for SM and messaged him right away to inquire.¬† He confirmed with me a few minutes later that indeed the \"free mochi set\" was only given if you made a purchase.¬† Thus, that's why they had deliberately used the word \"customer\" in their promotion. ...

I felt this was a very sneaky and deceptive marketing ploy and took advantage of people's inattentiveness by using the word \"customer\" and \"free\" in the same campaign and being vague about the giveaway criteria.¬† If it was the case that the mochi set wasn't going to be given for free (where the definition of \"free\" = no purchase), they should have stated in their campaign, \"BUY ONE GET ONE FREE\" instead.¬† That's what the campaign really was, NOT a free item.¬† It's so tacky to use just one word in the campaign to mislead their followers like that.¬† It's not right.

It gives a bad impression of MF before people even try the product.¬† It angers the consumer who shows up because they feel deceived.¬† I know I was and so was another friend who I ran into who was there as well.¬† Don't say something is \"free\" unless and until you actually don't have to pay to receive it.¬† Shame on you, MF and SM.

Anyway, it took a while (20 mins) to get to the front of the line to make an order with the cashier.¬† There was only one cashier which was why the line took so long to move up.

We ended up ordering the Meet Fresh Signature in order to receive the \"free mochi set\".¬† Ugh.

After placing the order, the cashier asked if we wanted the order to-go or to dine in.¬† I wanted to dine in.¬† The cashier told us to take a beeper and then head upstairs to the dining room to wait for our order.¬† I thought it was a little confusing since it wasn't clear from entering the restaurant at first that they had a dining room at all.¬† We finally found the staircase that led to the upstairs dining room.¬† The dining room was clean and modern with lots of seating.

The Q Mochi Set came in 8 pcs.¬† Their menu doesn't actually explain what it is other than it is \"Q Mochi\".¬† We liked the lighter colour mochi more.¬† It was very chewy and soft and I was impressed with the quality of the mochi!¬†

The Meet Fresh Signature contained pumpkin and taro mochi balls, grass jelly, and some shaved ice at at the bottom.¬† It wasn't until after we left and I had looked at some photos on social media that I realized that the staff completely forgot to give us the container of cream used to pour over the bowl when eating it.¬† Ugh.

The spherical mochi balls were chewy and not grainy.¬† However, the flavours of the pumpkin and taro weren't pronounced at all.¬† The grass jelly was good but didn't taste very fresh.¬† I've had better grass jelly and mochi balls before."}
{"text":"Arrived in the afternoon and there was a lineup to the door.  Waited about 10 minutes.  There's additional seating upstairs.  Everything is very clean.  Ordered three items: meet fresh signature (herbal jelly, herbal blended ice and taro balls), fresh green milk tea with taro and q mochi.

Q mochi was by far my favourite.  Had two flavours of mochi..glazed with a syrup and sprinkled with some toasted coconut shavings.  Meet fresh signature is a dish definitely meant to be shared.  Don't forget to mix!  The fresh green milk tea tasted authentic and contained real taro.  Enjoyable.

Overall a good experience and would come again, maybe not on a regular occurrence though. The only compliant would be the beeping discs. When there are many ppl waiting for their orders, the loud beeping reminds me of my morning alarm clock."}
{"text":"Excellent glass jelly dessert. Not too cold nor sweet. The ice blended nicely into the dessert. Usually I don't like dessert but this place, the signature one, I didn't want to share. I kept eating and eating. It was a bad bad migraine day for me, this helped. 

For the drink, I ordered the winter melon with lemon. It was a nice twist. But my husband think it has a dessert taste to it. I liked it.

The venue reminds me of being back in HK. You order downstairs and they give you a buzzer. Will take my mom here next time to try!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to the front of this restaurant there's no taro balls... but today I passed by and the sign saying \"no taro balls\" was removed! So I got myself an order.

The grass jelly is really smooth and delicate with the cream and tasted just like the one i tried back in china.

The only thing that's a little disappointing is how pricey the food here is.... I ordered a bowl of signature with extra taro and a milk tea with extra small taro balls, cost me 19 bucks almost 20.... 

Either way the taste was pretty decent, and it gave me nostalgic feelings lol, so it's probably worth it once in a while. :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after dinner and remembered seeing a video on Facebook about it so I decided to give it a try. It was a Tuesday evening around 7:30pm and it was quite empty when we got there. 

The menu on the screen was confusing - all it had were pictures labeled \"hot almond dessert no. 1-5\" and \"signature hot almond dessert\", but there was no description of what was in them and the differences between the different numbers, so we had to kind of guess by looking at the pictures. We ended up ordering #5, still not really knowing what was in the dessert. The screen said they were all on special for $6 instead of $8.70, but when we ordered it, the total charge was for the regular price, and we had to ask them about the special before they charged us the cheaper price. 

They gave us a buzzer and told us to sit upstairs. The seating area was surprisingly large and spacious. The downstairs area seems pretty small, so you wouldn't expect the upstairs seating area to be as nice as it was. It was well-lit and clean, and had cute walk decorations. There's also an individual restroom upstairs for guests to use. The upstairs area was quite empty around 7:30pm, but it got busier as it approached 8:30/9. 

The servers brought our dessert to a counter upstairs and our buzzer went off for us to go pick it up. It was nice that we didn't have to walk back downstairs to get our food. Our hot almond dessert didn't look anything like the photo on the menu as none of the toppings were showing, but when we stirred it, we were able to see the abundance of toppings. Overall, it tasted pretty good! It had red bean, mochi, tapioca, and sweet potato and taro balls. The sweet potato and taro balls could've been more flavourful - they basically tasted like mochi, but everything else was good. 

In summary, I'd say the experience here was decent. The menu was quite confusing and they almost overcharged us, but the place itself is pretty nice and the dessert was tasty. Service: 3 stars, Environment: 4 stars, Food: 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"If you like waiting 30 minutes for dessert and mediocre service, than this place is your jam. We ordered their signature dessert, not sure what it's called anymore. Anyway, the herbal grass jelly was good, but the taro balls were flavorless."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Meet Fresh to open since they were advertised half a year to a year ago. With such a long wait and seeing their photos on instagram, I was excited to try their Taiwanese dessert.

I was slightly disappointed with my meal for the price I paid. I ordered the hot herbal jelly with tapioca, mini taro balls, peanuts, taro, and red bean. Overall the flavours were decent. Not too sweet and a big enough portion. The taro balls were mini so I didn't get the chewy texture that i would've liked. The peanuts came on the side so that was a nice touch. Herbal jelly was smooth but not much flavour altogether with the rest. Taro were big chunks.

I went with a friend when they first opened so we got the mochi for free. I would not recommend them as it's expensive and you end up getting 8 small pieces of mochi the size of your finger. That being said, for the dish to be over 5 dollars, they did not resemble Japanese mochi but rather Chinese rice cake. Texture was soft but not like that of mochi. The white one is better than the dark one as the dark one had some weird chemical like after taste. This was not worth it even when it was free.

Overall, not sure if I would go back as I prefer the other Taiwanese dessert places on yonge. 

My friend also ordered their drink and was not completely satisfied. Perhaps I will come and try their drinks but for now, this would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I think I had too high an expectation for it and it didn't live up to it, came here a few times to give it a chance and hoping it would wow me one day and it didn't the taro balls for soft and kinda mushy not much of a chew to it, the herbal grass jelly was pretty good and had a good bite but the cold version was too much ice at the bottom and the hot versions were too watery."}
{"text":"I'll give them a 4 cuz they're new and cuz one of their items really did deserve a 4. However, there are a lot of items on their menu I think are rather pricey.

Upon ordering, they ask you if you eat in. If you do, they give you a beeper. It will ring and flash when your order is ready. They direct you upstairs. You choose a table. When your order is ready, they bring it upstairs to the pickup station and activate your beeper. You can't miss the beeper. That thing is loud and whiny and rather disruptive. If the dining room was full, that'd get really annoying. It's definitely more than just white noise.

I can't remember what it's called anymore, but their shaved ice item with all the meet fresh special toppings on it is a pretty good deal at under $11. It feeds two and has the egg pudding ($2.20 on their menu?), tapioca balls, 4 q mochi (8 come in a regular order and costs over $7), sweet potato and taro mochi bits, and a sesame mochi on top. This isn't bingsoo. It's grittier and not made of milk. It's more like carnival shaved ice, but instead of artificially flavored fruit syrup, there's brown sugar syrup and condensed milk. IT'S SO GOOD. A tad sweet, perhaps, but so good. Once again, the Q mochi wasn't my favorite, as it was rather gooey chewy (wow that rhyme) and was a tad large for one mouthful if I were to add shaved ice, but the rest of it was very good. 

I also really like their upstairs eating area. It's very clean and bright and they've got WiFi. They also have hooks under the table for hanging bags. We stress tested them with my brick of a purse. They passed inspection.

I'd go back for their shaved ice, especially their seasonal fruit flavors that are summer exclusives, but I'm not sure if I'd go back for their other desserts, given the pricing."}
{"text":"I decided to come try this new place out with a friend on a lazy weekday afternoon. Upon entering, it looked nicely renovated but thought it was small since there were counter-top seating on the sides. To my surprise, they had an upstairs place. My Taiwanese friend did some talking to the staff so I didn't understand most of the conversation.

They recommended a few dessert dishes but I settled for a tofu pudding with honey beans. We went upstairs with the order buzzer similar to ones at restaurant chains notifying that your table is ready. There is a hidden entrance where the staff come up to the 2nd floor to deliver the order. It is spacious upstairs with several tables and a nice window view of Yonge street. There were actually others who took advantage of the lazy afternoon as well.

In terms of the pudding, I like the smoothness of the tofu and the dessert overall was not too sweet. However, the actual bowl did not resemble too much to the one in the picture. Also, if there less of the soup, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening around 6.30pm, 7pm. The store seemed empty with only my boyfriend and I. 
Having seen so many Instagram post about this place and their Meet Fresh Signature dessert (cold), we ordered it. One for here and one to go (at $8.70 each). It comprises of grass jelly, taro balls, sweet potato balls, shaved ice with brown sugar, and a small coffee creamer. Indeed, the picture was Instagram-worthy, but the dessert was meh. I've tried better for cheaper. The balls are chewy, which is normal, but I didn't taste any taro or sweet potato, for me it was bland. The only thing that connects it with taro/sweet potato is the color of the balls. 

But what I liked it their unique way of serving their guests. They give you a buzzer and ask you to sit on the upper floor. The staff come up from the back when your food is ready and let you know through the buzzer that you can come get it (at the back, not at the counter on ground floor).

It was an OK experience and I will not revisit. 

Price: 2/5
Food: 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I always get the same thing the meet fresh signature (cold version). I personally like the slightly sweet herbal jelly. The ice in the bottom soaks up the extra juices given it a cold shock. When you add the cream it freezes over time creating that fattening mouthfeel. The whole combination as one is why I come back. I highly recommend it to try at least once."}
{"text":"Finally a chain store here in Toronto! The dessert they provide here are comparable to the flavours you get in Taiwan. Although quite pricey but the ingredients used aren't bland and very flavourful. Whether it's their tofu pudding, grass jelly, or shaved ice, they all taste quite authentic."}
{"text":"I was never a big grass jelly fan until my friends showed me this place!  Meet Fresh is a worldwide franchise and they finally expanded to Toronto!  This place specializes in Grass Jelly so if you are a fan, this place is a must visit!

I had the Meet Fresh Special which is Grass Jelly with Taro Balls topped with the milk, to add some extra flavours, we also added the boba as one of the toppings.  I have to say, this dish is surprisingly very delicious and the boba here is top notch!! If only they stop running out of taro balls ALL THE TIME, this would of been a 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Big disappointment on their desserts. I ordered the tofu pudding#1 and excited to try it. Barely have any toppings! Tofu is also tasteless. Totally not worth it and Will not go back for sure!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. My friend and I came around 10pm on a Saturday night and ordered their Meet Fresh Signature (cold), which had herbal jelly, taro & sweet potato balls, and cream on top of shaved ice. The shaved ice is Taiwanese-styled so it's slushier & icier than a bingsu, and is flavored w/ brown sugar syrup & cream. It was a nice contrast to the grass jelly, which was very smooth & delicate. And I liked that the latter wasn't overly bitter or sweet. The cream also added another layer of depth to the bowl, both texture & flavor-wise, and bonded well w/ the rest of the ingredients. In terms of the taro & sweet potato balls, both were fresh & suitably chewy, but the flavor of the sweet potato balls was not nearly as condensed as the taro one. I actually wasn't sure if it was sweet potatoes or squash, and that was deduced from the orange color. Nonetheless, it was a good bowl of dessert and I would come back for it. 

The bigger issue though was the wait time, which I've -0.5 stars for. The line-up to order wasn't too bad, but after placing our order, we had to wait 20 mins for that one bowl-- which they just needed to scoop the ingredients in. Two lines of customers ordered and left with their food before we got ours. Maybe they forgot our order but it was ridiculous; I'll just be getting take-out next time."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed with the desserts here. I ordered the herbal grass jelly dessert (cold) and found it to be very light in taste to the point of it being flavorless (evening the toppings). With this being said, the prices are a little high for what you get. In general, I do love grass/herbal jelly desserts and will give it another chance... These desserts are not meant to be overly sweet and the toppings is what give the dessert it's flavor!"}
{"text":"I love my Taiwanese dessert so the giant plates of shaved ice and really delicious grass jelly is definitely up my ally.   I wish they weren't out of taro balls because that's also one of my favourites but their pudding is solid!     Prices seem fine for what we got and I would totally go again!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!
I spent 15 min lined up. 
Waited 30' for my order.
Everyone came after me ( there were like 20 people after me) got their order and left the store.
I came asked them whether they have my order yet. 
They told me its not done yet.
Waited 20 more minutes to got my order.
I dont know and dont understand how their system work.
But it should be first come first serve."}
{"text":"Ordered the Meet Fresh Signature with shaved ice, grass jelly, and taro balls. While the grass jelly was flavourful and refreshing, overall the dish was rather tasteless. This was after an unreasonably long wait for the dish. I would only return during a time that is less busy."}
{"text":"I was so excited for Meet Fresh to open! I had it in Asia and I really like the shaved ice desserts here. 

When I visited this location, it was confusing how you need to order at the lower level and then go upstairs to get a table. But luckily they bring you your orders to the upper level instead of having you go back downstairs. 

Service: the service was adequate. Not much service needed since everything is self service. But I think the employees could have been more enthusiastic about their job especially during their first month of opening.

Food: I ordered the taro shaved ice. It was really watery and it didn't blend together as much as I would like. It had enough toppings and it looked as expected as in the menu photos. But I think it lacked in taste. It was different than what I'm used to from the locations in Asia. Perhaps this location is new and they are still perfecting it."}
{"text":"Last night, we decided to go to Meet Fresh in the last minute. The purple rice desserts were already sold out. So, we ordered the meet fresh special and the taro ball 2. 

Meet fresh special: they put the herbal jelly sauce ( the main ingredient to make grass jelly) on the ice to enhanced the grass jelly flavor! Also, The grass jelly texture is soo soft! 

Taro ball special 2: All I remember is that their Yam topping is delicious!!!

Both desserts have taro balls. When we got the desserts, I had the taro balls first. It was warm and soggy. But, after I mix them with the ice, it became chewy and it was delicious! I have been searching for delicious taro balls in Toronto for couple years. Meet Fresh is a popular dessert chain in Taiwan. Their taro balls tasted like the ones I had in Taiwan! I was surprised that they didn't chill the taro balls with the sugar water to enhance the chewy texture. Normally, the dessert shop in Taiwan will put the cooked taro balls in the sugar water to chill before serving them in both hot and cold desserts. 

Overall, the price is pretty expensive, but their toppings and grass jelly are delicious! In the future, I probably will only order cold desserts if I want to have the taro balls!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for the past year and I finally got to try the long awaited Meet Fresh Toronto! They specialize in herbal jelly so that's what my party and I ordered. We got herbal jelly #4 & #5 as well as the signature. 

After ordering, you take your buzzer and find a seat upstairs and someone will bring the food to you. They also have a few seating area downstairs. However, it's probably best to grab a table first before ordering 'cause I saw a huge group of probably 10 people ordering and then going upstairs trying to look for seats that would accommodate everyone.

At first we thought the bowl looked kinda small but don't be fooled, the size was shareable. I also liked how I was able to swap ingredients at no extra charge. They also ran out of the regular sized taro balls so we got the smaller ones instead. 

In terms of taste, I didn't taste much taro flavor (compared to ZenQ) but the texture was chewy. The grass jelly was quite dense compared to ZenQ as well but I think that's because there wasn't much liquid and more ice. 

Price point, I think it's a tad expensive whereas ZenQ is relatively cheaper and just down the street. I might come back if I'm in the area though. 

I also got take out for herbal jelly #5 and it wasn't even full...plus the portion is like smaller than dining in, in my opinion. By the time I got home, the ice melted which I preferred LOL."}
{"text":"Tried a few items - taro ball #4, taro ball #5 and herbal jelly #4. Both time the taro chunks weren't cooked thoroughly. Was excited to try the taro ball but wasn't impressed at all, just sweet chewing balls without taro flavor. Portion for hot dishes were horrible, mostly red bean soup with a few taro balls... definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Taste good with friendly service. Been here twice, both are pleasant service. However the waiting time is a bit long, I heard some customers complaining."}
{"text":"The Good: Ah the place that was under construction for almost 1.5 years and tempted all those yonge street bystanders for in all that time. The result? It was worth the wait. First the food, I ordered the signature Meet Fresh Signature cold dish, which includes Herbal Jelly, Taro Balls, Mochi Balls, and cream. I felt it was perfect, it wasn't too sweet, the herbal jelly tasted good (unlike some of the other places), and the mochi was soft. The consistency was great. I highly recommend the signature Meet Fresh Cold dish for those who are indecisive or just want to give this place a try. The menu is pretty big. An added tip, the free mochi is pretty good too. I loved it cause it was free (for their soft opening), but probably would never order if it wasn't, just my opinion :) IMO I would chose this place over ZenQ and mabu station (in terms of a similar dish of the herbal jelly and mochi). 

The Bad: I would have liked another cream (they only provided one), I'm sure I could have requested for one, but they got a bit busy (get to that part in a bit). Otherwise nothing bad, but...

The Ugly: The wait time is long. The order time was quick and easy, but just waiting for my dish took close to 45 minutes (granted my dish seemed pretty standard to make). However, to give them the benefit of the doubt, it was a soft opening, they are still getting things into a normal procedure, and of course their staff is new.. so, I expect this to be less of an issue in the future. With that being said...

Extra tip: ... I would definitely come back to try their other dishes (and on the meantime update my review). Expect long waits for your food to come. There is an upstairs section, which has a lot of seating. They would kindly ask you to go upstairs to wait for your food there (first floor is more for those going in and out or waiting to order). Price wise, I think its pretty average ($8.70 for my signature dish), which isn't over the norm. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Uh oh, Meet Fresh, you really surprised us when we brought the order home only to find grass jelly, taro balls, and shaved ice.  There was no barley, milk, sweet potatoes, and tapioca as suggested by \"Herbal Jelly No. 2\" on the menu.

It was at around 9:15pm when we made our order, and they were very busy.  It took about 25 minutes for us to get our food.  Later, when we went back to the store to show them their mistake, we were simply offered to have our order remade.  No refunds or coupons, just an offer to redo our order.  Sadly, they didn't even redo the order properly (after being given our original receipt) because this time, the extra taro balls we've originally paid for were missing, but at this point, we were really in no mood to go back for another reorder.

Seeing as this was our 3rd attempt to give this restaurant a chance (our first attempt was about a month ago when they ran out of taro balls), we're sure it's not worth our while to go back again."}
{"text":"To start off I don't really like sweets.  I order most drinks unsweetened and I already used up my sweet quotas for alcohol and cocktails.  Meet Fresh is a famous Taiwanese dessert shop that specializes in shaved ice and I heard many good things about it so I decided to give it a try.  It was a cool night in Toronto and surprisingly, I enjoyed every bite of the herbal shaved ice.  The shop went out of taro balls that evening and I had the Meet Fresh Signature herbal jelly $8.70.  I like the semi sweet dessert they offer and will definitely come back for more since they have many options to choose from."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taiwan sweet shop, you have to try the Taro Ball and grass Jelly!!!
they are sooooo yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Meet Fresh when I first had it in Vietnam and California. So glad that the one in Toronto is finally open! I came back to Meet Fresh with an open mind after I had been told that the first time I had come, it had been a soft opening. They fixed many of their problems since.


Pros:
- Dessert: If you love asian desserts, you will love Meet Fresh. Everyone seems to love the taro balls. They are so chewy and seem to always sell out when I come. They have tons of options 
- Seating: If you choose to dine upstairs, you are given a buzzer and your order will come up stairs to you. No need to wait downstairs for your order! 
- Service: The service has improved a lot since I came here. The server was really nice and helped me pick which items were popular and recommended what I should get which I really appreciated.

Cons:
- Items being out of stock: It sucks when a popular selling item is sold out when you get there. i ordered the Meet Fresh Signature Herbal Jelly and they ran out of herbal ice and taro balls. The server had offered to substitute my order with small taro balls which tasted good as well. It just sucks that you wait and then you find out at cash that they are out of an item. Not sure if they would consider posting a sign up at the front door when they run out of an item. 
- Lineups: Beware that if you come on a weekend at around 7-9pm, you will find a line up to order. This took about 15-20 minutes to place your order and another 10-25 to get your order. 
- Price: I find that the items on the menu are a little pricey. It can range between $7-9 dollars per item. 

Items I liked:

- Purple Rice Porridge with Rice Balls (Recommend getting this hot)
- Meet Fresh Signature Herbal Jelly
- Boba Fresh Milk Tea"}
{"text":"The store was nicely renovated but they seem to always be running out of taro balls for some reason. Their signature dish was alright but nothing special... the GF and I prefer the assorted taro, mochi, grass jelly dishes at Mabu station as it is a lot cheaper, nicely presented and comes in a massive bowl."}
{"text":"True to my word I visited again because of those delicious rice balls. I opted for the tofu pudding #5 and the egg pudding since they are still out of taro balls and no timeline as to when it will arrive. Hopefully next month? Anyways, tofu pudding was okay... the texture wasn't silky and it was a bit dense. Not like how they make it in Taiwan and frankly not a fan. #5 comes with the kidney beans and the rice balls, both of which were very good. I also got the egg pudding. It was $2.2 and comes in a small plastic container with sweetened tapioca balls on top. The egg pudding had good egg flavour and the caramel sauce on top balances it out. It's not quite a competitor with Taiwan's Tong YI egg pudding (my fave) but it's still pretty good. 

Hopefully they get all the inventory kinks sorted out and things will fly. I'm not giving up hope yet!"}
{"text":"Though a tad pricey, I felt the desserts were great! Soft and chewy mochi, fresh for sure. Great service - they kept apologizing as of course they were still trying to find their rhythm. Their space upstairs is nice, modern, bright. Lots to order from on their menu. Happy that they finally opened!
I typically am not a fan of grass jelly but their was great texture, not too sweet, and not bitter!  I'm now a convert! Just got back from a long trip in Taiwan, and I'd say their mochi balls par those I had in taiwan, so I feel MF's quality is good and authentic."}
{"text":"This place was pretty busy even on a week night. When I went, they ran out of both the large and small taro balls, so that was a little disappointing. I ended up ordering the herbal jelly no. 5 with rice balls, kidney beans, and boba. There are additional seating on the second floor. After ordering, they give you a buzzer to notify when your order is ready. The food is delivered to a counter on the second floor so you don't have to tackle the stairs with food in hand.

The cold version of herbal jelly No. 5 sits on top of a bed of shaved ice and brown sugar syrup. The jelly was refreshing, and has a nice texture. The boba and rice balls were fresh, soft and chewy. The kidney beans were okay. It did taste a lot better after pouring the little cup of cream over it, it tasted a little like brown sugar milk tea with grass jelly, especially after the ice melted a bit.

My friend got the tofu pudding no. 4 with taro and red bean. I would not recommend that one. It's just afew pieces of tofu in a large bowl of sugar water."}
{"text":"Brand new place that just opened a few months ago.   They were handing out a free mochi dessert so I lined up for it.   The prices on the menu is a bit on the high side.  Expect about $12 total for a dessert.    There are tables upstairs so that's where I would pick to eat it."}
{"text":"I would give a zero star if allowed by yelp. This place does not deserve a single star. Their taro balls are very soft and mushy and not chewy. I paid close to 9 dollars for their most popular bowl (#1) and all I got was a few small rice balls (in which they substituted for the lack of tapioca) and also a few taro balls(yes, no more than 6). Had they given me a few good taro balls, then I could justify and say \"I've tried this place, it's decent but it's overpriced, I would never go back\". However, if your restaurant specializes in taro balls, yet, you fail in that department, then your restaurant does not deserve to stay open. Service was just as bad as their products but since most of their staff are new, I would not hold this against them. Overall, a major disappointment and needless to say, you are better off taking your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have had Meet Fresh in California many times and so when we heard about this, we definitely had to give them a try. I was afraid it wasn't going to be as good, as sometimes chain restaurants can vary from store to store. Well we were pleased that it was just as good! Essentially the same menu. My only complaint is the location and how the shop is two stories. Nothing particularly bad, just awkward situation. We didn't realize you order downstairs and pick up upstairs. Again, not a big deal, just a little confusing for first timers. You have a tendency to want to stay downstairs and wait for your order. Definitely go for the signature #1 cold! That's my favorite. If you haven't had it before, you'll want to drizzle the little creamer they give you over your order. It's really good! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Their pudding and q mochi combo is my fav, the price is really inexpensive and it tastes delish! The q mochi is super soft and chewy and the Pur√©e they use is delish. I love the presentation of the food too. Also if you eat in, they have nice seating area upstairs with lots of window light in the back (perfect for food photos loll). The buzzer they provide will buzz and then you go to the pick up location for your items"}
{"text":"When I came by with a group of friends, I got their milk tea with herbal jelly. I'm going to be frank and say that it was an utter disappointment; it tasted like water and the texture of the herbal jelly was off. Among the different establishments in the area, I would go elsewhere for drinks but would maybe consider the desserts as they do reflect the traditional Taiwanese taste buds. However, if you privy a more western taste of desserts, I would avoid this spot and walk down the street to visit other hot spots in the area."}
{"text":"Overprice!!!!!! Sooooo few taro balls. How come a few taro balls plus some ice costs almost $10. ????"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday after lunch, there was a constant line up at the cashier, and the seating upstairs was filled up. The place was clean and bright. The menu displayed a variety of good looking dessert photos, and the staff in the kitchen was assembling a big bowl of shaved ice while I was in line, it got me excited to try out the Taiwanese desserts here.
We ordered Taro Ball No. 5 (hot), Tofu Pudding No. 2 (hot), and Meet Fresh Signature Herbal Jelly (cold). I was surprised that they did not have taro balls as it was just afternoon, looking at other reviews seems like they often do not prepare them.  Substitution was mini taro balls, which threw off the ratio.  
Both Taro Ball No.5 and Tofu Pudding No.2 came not as expected.  The amount of the content looked much less than the photos on the menu. Taro Ball No.5 looked like just liquid soup, the ingredients took up about half of that soup.  The red bean soup was the only thing we could taste, the small orange and purple-colored balls were tasteless (we were expecting sweet potatoes and taro taste).
The table next to us ordered Taro Ball No.4 and that one was piled up nicely as one would expect, made me think our dishes were prepared by a less experienced staff.
Tofu Pudding No.2 was supposed to have barley, but the one that arrived barely had any and we had to send it back and had another one made.  This one tasted better than Taro Ball No.5, but the tofu pudding was not as smooth as the Hong Kong ones that we were used to.
Meet Fresh Signature Herbal Jelly was the winner out of the three dishes.  At least the amount and ratio were closest to the photo on the menu after the mini taro balls substitution.  Taste was refreshing, could have used another evaporated milk pod though (only one was given).  Texture of the herbal jelly, tapioca, and mini taro balls combined together was fun to chew.
Overall taste is not bad but it is a bit pricy for what is offered."}
{"text":"They will loose popularity if they don't fill up orders faster. No one waits 30min+ for a mediocre desert."}
{"text":"I came here around a month ago when they first opened with my boyfriend. We got the meet fresh signature grass jelly and got a free mochi set. The line was pretty long but it was most likely due to the free mochi promo. The grassjelly and shaved ice was good but not too flavourful. What was really amazing was the taro balls and the mochi. They were warm, freshly made, and were just the right amount of chewiness. I would definitely go back just for the taro balls."}
{"text":"Place is really pretty. More seating on the second floor. Its massive up there and looks like a great place to hang out and talk. Got the signature dish which I thought was delicious! Would I come back? Yes I would. Pretty excited to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"My new desserts obsession! I tried their signature bowl which comes with grass jelly, some brown sugar ice, taro balls, etc. I didn't expect to like this as much as I do. I definitely recommend trying this if you're not a fan over overly sweet desserts- and get the iced version because the brown sugar ice is the perfect texture to contrast with the grass jelly texture!

They have a pretty big upstairs area which kinda looks like a cafeteria. It's modern looking, clean, has outlets, and is a good study spot. After you order, they will bring the desserts upstairs to you if you're dining in and not doing takeout :)"}
{"text":"They never have any taro balls. Please change your name and stop giving false hope to your customers."}
{"text":"Their menu is full of desserts and drinks but I was trying to save my stomach for a huge dinner that night so I got something small to try - peanut mochi ball ($2.20). Did not enjoy this at all. I let my company try a bite of it and none of them liked it.. barely half of the ball was gone. 

The grass jelly taro ball was significantly better but if it wasn't for the unique taro ball then the bowl itself is nothing special. The taro ball is light and chewy. 

We also had a egg pudding deluxe and this was prob my favourite item of them all. Pudding and tapioca was sweet and you can get this on the side for 2.20 I shouldhv went with my gut and got that first."}
{"text":"My favorite herbal jelly shaved ice spot. 
My only and go to order is their Signature grass jelly with taro and sweet potato balls. I like to add the mini taro /sweet potato balls and also use 1-2 creamers for this dessert. It's not too sweet and super refreshing!"}
{"text":"Pricy for the amount you get. It was good but nothing special. It does bring back memories of having mung bean, sweet potato, barley, in different Asian desserts I tried when I was younger. The herbal dessert I got was not overly sweet which I enjoyed. You have the option of it served cold or hot. If you have sensitive teeth, stick with hot. I had a hard time eating my cold dessert."}
{"text":"It was a nice and cozy place which separate the ordering area and dinning area. It's great for small group gathering and chatting. Some students discuss and study here as a study group. The food is great too! I love the hot taro balls!"}
{"text":"Came here in a big snow day. The hot grass jelly (their signature bowl) was so perfect for the weather. It really warmed me up. The dish is a Taiwanese tradition dessert as how I remembered back in the days. The sweetness level was just right. Probably the best Hot Grass Jelly I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not bad here! I tried the herbal fresh milk tea with herbal jelly and also tried some of their signature jelly dessert. The grass jelly and their other toppings taste very good and fresh, and they didn't taste like they were old at all. If I lived in the area, I know I'd be here very often to try all of their desserts and what they have to offer. 

I will say that I feel Iike it is a little expensive here for some of their desserts, but I doubt anyone really eats the jelly desserts that often so the price I would say is understandable for a \"treat yourself\" kind of visit. My only complaint is the fact that some of the workers don't say the order numbers out in English when they are ready. I know it's kind of a small complaint and it didn't really bother me that much, but I know this might cause confusion or bother other patrons."}
